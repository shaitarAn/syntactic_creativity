"С этой минуты она уже не отпускала его более от себя, она потребовала, чтоб он сел у ее изголовья. Говорить она могла мало, но всё смотрела на него и улыбалась ему как блаженная. Она вдруг точно обратилась в какую-то дурочку. Всё как будто переродилось. Шатов то плакал, как маленький мальчик, то говорил бог знает что, дико, чадно, вдохновенно; целовал у ней руки; она слушала с упоением, может быть и не понимая, но ласково перебирала ослабевшею рукой его волосы, приглаживала их, любовалась ими. Он говорил ей о Кириллове, о том, как теперь они жить начнут, «вновь и навсегда», о существовании бога, о том, что все хороши… В восторге опять вынули ребеночка посмотреть.","From that moment on, she no longer let go of him, she demanded that he sit down at her bedside.

"Дроздовы были тоже помещики нашей губернии, но служба генерала Ивана Ивановича (бывшего приятеля Варвары Петровны и сослуживца ее мужа) постоянно мешала им навестить когда-нибудь их великолепное поместье. По смерти же генерала, приключившейся в прошлом году, неутешная Прасковья Ивановна отправилась с дочерью за границу, между прочим и с намерением употребить виноградное лечение, которое и располагала совершить в Vernex-Montreux во вторую половину лета. По возвращении же в отечество намеревалась поселиться в нашей губернии навсегда. В городе у нее был большой дом, много уже лет стоявший пустым, с заколоченными окнами. Люди были богатые. Прасковья Ивановна, в первом супружестве госпожа Тушина, была, как и пансионская подруга ее Варвара Петровна, тоже дочерью откупщика прошедшего времени и тоже вышла замуж с большим приданым. Отставной штаб-ротмистр Тушин и сам был человек со средствами и с некоторыми способностями. Умирая, он завещал своей семилетней и единственной дочери Лизе хороший капитал. Теперь, когда Лизавете Николаевне было уже около двадцати двух лет, за нею смело можно было считать до двухсот тысяч рублей одних ее собственных денег, не говоря уже о состоянии, которое должно было ей достаться со временем после матери, не имевшей детей во втором супружестве. Варвара Петровна была, по-видимому, весьма довольна своею поездкой. По ее мнению, она успела сговориться с Прасковьей Ивановной удовлетворительно и тотчас же по приезде сообщила всё Степану Трофимовичу; даже была с ним весьма экспансивна, что давно уже с нею не случалось.","The Drozdovs were also landowners in our province, but the service of General Ivan Ivanovich (a former friend of Varvara Petrovna and a colleague of her husband) constantly prevented them from ever visiting their magnificent estate.

Praskovya Ivanovna, Mrs. Tushina in her first marriage, was, like her boarding school friend Varvara Petrovna, also the daughter of a farmer of the past tense, and she also married with a large dowry. The retired staff captain Tushin himself was a man with means and with some abilities. Dying, he bequeathed to his seven-year-old and only daughter Liza a good capital. Now, when Lizaveta Nikolaevna was already about twenty-two years old, she could safely count up to two hundred thousand rubles of her own money alone, not to mention the fortune that she should have inherited over time after her mother, who had no children in the second marriage. Varvara Petrovna was apparently very pleased with her trip.

"Затем у нас наступило затишье и тянулось почти сплошь все эти девять лет. Истерические взрывы и рыдания на моем плече, продолжавшиеся регулярно, нисколько не мешали нашему благоденствию. Удивляюсь, как Степан Трофимович не растолстел за это время. Покраснел лишь немного его нос и прибавилось благодушия. Мало-помалу около него утвердился кружок приятелей, впрочем постоянно небольшой. Варвара Петровна хоть и мало касалась кружка, но все мы признавали ее нашею патронессой. После петербургского урока она поселилась в нашем городе окончательно; зимой жила в городском своем доме, а летом в подгородном своем имении. Никогда она не имела столько значения и влияния, как в последние семь лет, в нашем губернском обществе, то есть вплоть до назначения к нам нашего теперешнего губернатора. Прежний губернатор наш, незабвенный и мягкий Иван Осипович, приходился ей близким родственником и был когда-то ею облагодетельствован. Супруга его трепетала при одной мысли не угодить Варваре Петровне, а поклонение губернского общества дошло до того, что напоминало даже нечто греховное. Было, стало быть, хорошо и Степану Трофимовичу. Он был членом клуба, осанисто проигрывал и заслужил почет, хотя многие смотрели на него только как на «ученого». Впоследствии, когда Варвара Петровна позволила ему жить в другом доме, нам стало еще свободнее. Мы собирались у него раза по два в неделю; бывало весело, особенно когда он не жалел шампанского. Вино забиралось в лавке того же Андреева. Расплачивалась по счету Варвара Петровна каждые полгода, и день расплаты почти всегда бывал днем холерины.","Then we had a lull and lasted almost all of these nine years. The hysterical outbursts and sobs on my shoulder, which continued regularly, did not in the least interfere with our well-being. I am surprised that Stepan Trofimovich has not grown fat during this time. His nose reddened only a little, and complacency increased. Little by little, a circle of friends settled around him, though always small. Although Varvara Petrovna touched the circle little, we all recognized her as our patroness. After the Petersburg lesson, she finally settled in our city; in winter she lived in her city house, and in summer in her suburban estate. It has never had so much significance and influence as in the last seven years in our provincial society, that is, until the appointment of our present governor to us. Our former governor, the unforgettable and gentle Ivan Osipovich, was a close relative of hers and was once favored by her. His wife trembled at the mere thought of not pleasing Varvara Petrovna, and the worship of the provincial society reached the point that it even resembled something sinful. It was, therefore, good for Stepan Trofimovich too. He was a member of the club, lost stoutly and deserved credit, although many looked at him only as a ""scholar"". Subsequently, when Varvara Petrovna allowed him to live in another house, we became even freer. We used to meet with him twice a week; it was fun, especially when he did not spare champagne. The wine was taken in the shop of the same Andreev. Varvara Petrovna paid off her bill every six months, and the day of payment was almost always the day of cholera.","After this followed a period of calm that stretched on for virtually these entire nine years. The hysterical outbursts and sobbings on my shoulder, which continued at regular intervals, had no effect on our state of well-being. I am surprised that Stepan Trofimovich didn’t get fat during this time. His nose simply grew rather red, and he became more benign, that was all. Gradually a circle of friends formed around him, albeit never large. Although Varvara Petrovna had little to do with this circle, we nonetheless recognized her as our patroness. After the lesson of Petersburg, she settled for good in our town. In winter she lived in her house in town, and in summer on her estate just out of town. She had never had as much importance and influence in the society of our town as in the past seven years, that is, right up to the time when our present governor was appointed. Our former governor, the mild and unforgettable Ivan Osipovich, was a close relative of hers and had once been beholden to her. His wife trembled at the very thought of not pleasing Varvara Petrovna, and the homage rendered her by the society of the province became so marked that it verged on outright sin. Consequently, Stepan Trofimovich was living very well indeed. He was a member of the local club, lost at cards in lordly manner and won well-deserved esteem, although many regarded him merely as a ‘learned man’. Subsequently, when Varvara Petrovna allowed him to live in a house of his own, we began to enjoy even greater freedom. We would gather at his place about twicea week; we were a merry band, especially when he didn’t stint on the champagne. The wine was procured from the shop of that same Andreyev. The bill was paid twice a year by Varvara Petrovna, and the day on which it was paid was almost always the day of one of Stepan Trofimovich’s attacks of cholerine.","Then came a lull which continued almost unbroken for all these nine years. Hysterical outbursts and weepings on my shoulder, which regularly recurred, did not hinder our prosperity in the least. I am surprised how it could have been that Stepan Trofimovich did not put on weight during that time. His nose only became a little redder, and he grew more benign. Gradually a circle of friends established itself around him, though a perpetually small one. Varvara Petrovna, who had little contact with this circle, was nevertheless acknowledged by us all as our patroness. After the Petersburg lesson, she settled herself permanently in our town; the winters she spent in her town house, and the summers on her suburban estate. Never before had she enjoyed so much importance and influence in our provincial society as during the last seven years, that is, right up to the appointment of our present governor. Our former governor, the mild and unforgettable Ivan Osipovich, was a close relation of hers and had once been the object of her benefactions. His wife trembled at the very thought of displeasing Varvara Petrovna, and the reverence of provincial society even went so far as to resemble something sinful. It was, consequently, good for Stepan Trofimovich as well. He was a member of the club, lost majestically at cards, and earned himself esteem, though many looked upon him as merely a ""scholar."" Later on, when Varvara Petrovna permitted him to live in a separate house, we felt even more free. We gathered at his place about twice a week; it used to get quite merry, especially when he was generous with the champagne. The wine came from the shop of that same Andreev. Varvara Petrovna paid the bill every six months, and the day of payment was almost always a day of cholerine."

"Это был очень невысокий, чопорный старичок, лет, впрочем, не более пятидесяти пяти, с довольно румяным личиком, с густыми седенькими локончиками, выбившимися из-под круглой цилиндрической шляпы и завивавшимися около чистеньких, розовеньких, маленьких ушков его. Чистенькое личико его было не совсем красиво, с тонкими, длинными, хитро сложенными губами, с несколько мясистым носом и с востренькими, умными, маленькими глазками. Он был одет как-то ветхо, в каком-то плаще внакидку, какой, например, носили бы в этот сезон где-нибудь в Швейцарии или в Северной Италии. Но по крайней мере все мелкие вещицы его костюма: запоночки, воротнички, пуговки, черепаховый лорнет на черной тоненькой ленточке, перстенек непременно были такие же, как и у людей безукоризненно хорошего тона. Я уверен, что летом он ходит непременно в каких-нибудь цветных прюнелевых ботиночках с перламутровыми пуговками сбоку. Когда мы столкнулись, он приостановился на повороте улицы и осматривался со вниманием. Заметив, что я любопытно смотрю на него, он медовым, хотя несколько крикливым голоском спросил меня:","He was a very short, prim old man, no more than fifty-five years old, by the way, with a rather ruddy face, with thick gray curls protruding from under a round cylindrical hat and curling around his clean, pink, small ears. His clean little face was not entirely handsome, with thin, long, cunningly folded lips, a somewhat fleshy nose, and sharp, intelligent little eyes. He was dressed somehow shabbily, in some kind of cloak, which, for example, would be worn this season somewhere in Switzerland or in northern Italy. But at least all the small things of his costume: cufflinks, collars, buttons, a tortoiseshell lorgnette on a black thin ribbon, a ring were certainly the same as those of people of impeccably good taste. I am sure that in the summer he goes without fail in some colored prunel shoes with mother-of-pearl buttons on the side. When we collided, he paused at the turn of the street and looked around with attention. Noticing that I was looking at him curiously, he asked me in a honeyed, although somewhat noisy voice:","He was a very short, prim little old man, although no more than about fifty-five, with a rather ruddy little face, thick little grey curls that peeped from under a stovepipe hat3 and twined round his clean, rosy little ears. His clean little face was not altogether handsome, with its thin, long, slyly-set lips, its rather fleshy nose and its sharp, intelligent little eyes. He was dressed rather shabbily, with a kind of cloak thrown over his shoulders, of a style that would, for instance, be worn this season somewhere in Switzerland or Northern Italy. But at least all the small details of his costume — cuff-links, collars, buttons, tortoiseshell lorgnette4 on a slender black ribbon, signet ring — were exactly as they were worn by people of impeccably good taste. I’m certain that in the summer he undoubtedly went around in coloured prunella5 shoes with mother-of-pearl buttons on the side. When we bumped into each other, he had paused at a turning in the street and was looking around attentively. Noticing that I was looking at him with curiosity, he asked me in a mellifluous though penetrating thin voice:","He was quite a short, prim little old man, though no more than fifty-five, with a rather red-cheeked little face, with thick gray locks emerging from under his round cylindrical hat and curling behind his clean, pink little ears.

"Она ушла совершенно довольная. По виду Шатова и по разговору его оказалось ясно как день, что этот человек «в отцы собирается и тряпка последней руки».

"После внезапного и неожиданного свидания с Лизой, которое я уже описал, пустился он еще в большем самозабвении далее. Большая дорога проходила в полуверсте от Скворешников, и – странно – он даже и не приметил сначала, как вступил на нее. Основательно рассуждать или хоть отчетливо сознавать было для него в ту минуту невыносимо. Мелкий дождь то переставал, то опять начинался; но он не замечал и дождя. Не заметил тоже, как закинул себе сак за плечо и как от этого стало ему легче идти. Должно быть, он прошел так версту или полторы, когда вдруг остановился и осмотрелся. Старая, черная и изрытая колеями дорога тянулась пред ним бесконечною нитью, усаженная своими ветлами; направо – голое место, давным-давно сжатые нивы; налево – кусты, а далее за ними лесок. И вдали – вдали едва приметная линия уходящей вкось железной дороги и на ней дымок какого-то поезда; но звуков уже не было слышно. Степан Трофимович немного оробел, но лишь на мгновение. Беспредметно вздохнул он, поставил свой сак подле ветлы и присел отдохнуть. Делая движение садясь, он ощутил в себе озноб и закутался в плед; заметив тут же и дождь, распустил над собою зонтик. Довольно долго сидел он так, изредка шамкая губами и крепко сжав в руке ручку зонтика. Разные образы лихорадочной вереницей неслись пред ним, быстро сменяясь в его уме. «Lise, Lise, – думал он, – а с нею се Maurice[237] … Странные люди… Но что же это за странный был там пожар, и про что они говорили, и какие убитые?.. Мне кажется, Stasie еще ничего не успела узнать и еще ждет меня с кофеем… В карты? Разве я проигрывал в карты людей? Гм… у нас на Руси, во время так называемого крепостного права… Ах боже мой, а Федька?»","After a sudden and unexpected meeting with Lisa, which I have already described, he set off further in even greater self-forgetfulness. The main road passed half a verst from Skvoreshnikov, and - strangely - he did not even notice at first how he stepped on it. It was unbearable for him at that moment to reason thoroughly, or even to perceive clearly. The light rain stopped and then started again; but he did not notice the rain either. He also did not notice how he threw his sack over his shoulder and how it became easier for him to walk. He must have walked about a mile or a half, when he suddenly stopped and looked around. The old, black and rutted road stretched before him like an endless thread, planted with its willows; to the right - a bare place, a long time ago compressed fields; to the left - bushes, and then a forest behind them. And in the distance, in the distance, a barely perceptible line of a sloping railroad and on it the smoke of some train; but there were no more sounds. Stepan Trofimovich became a little timid, but only for a moment. He sighed aimlessly, put his sack beside the willow, and sat down to rest. As he made the motion to sit down, he felt chills in himself and wrapped himself in a plaid; noticing the rain at once, he unfurled his umbrella over himself. For a long time he sat like that, occasionally mumbling his lips and tightly squeezing the handle of his umbrella in his hand. Various images raced before him in a feverish procession, rapidly changing in his mind. “Lise, Lise,” he thought, “and Maurice[237] with her ... Strange people ... But what kind of strange fire was there, and what were they talking about, and what kind of dead? .. It seems to me that Stasie is still nothing I didn’t have time to find out and is still waiting for me with coffee ... In cards? Did I lose people at cards? Hm... in Russia, during the so-called serfdom... Oh my God, what about Fedka?""","After his sudden and unexpected meeting with Liza, which I have already described, he set off again in an even greater state of oblivion. The high road ran half a verst from Skvoreshniki, and strangely enough, he didn’t even notice at first how he had come to be on it. It was unbearable for him just then to think anything through or even to be clearly aware of anything. The fine rain now stopped, now began again; he didn’t even notice the rain. Nor did he notice that he had thrown the bag over his shoulder and that made it easier for him to walk. He must have gone something like a verst or a verst and a half when he suddenly stopped and looked around. The old, black and rutted road stretched before him in an unbroken thread, with white willows planted on either side. To the right there was an utterly bare spot, where the harvest had long ago been reaped; to the left were bushes, and beyond them a wooded area. And in the distance, in the far distance, the barely perceptible line of the railway ran crosswise, and on it the faint smoke of some train, but no sound could be heard. Stepan Trofimovich quailed somewhat, but only for a moment. After sighing for no particular reason, he set his bag by a willow tree and sat down to rest. As he moved to sit down, he felt a chill and wrapped himself in his plaid; then, suddenly noticing the rain, he opened his umbrella over himself. He remained sitting for a rather long time like this, moving his lips now and then and firmly gripping the umbrella handle in his hands. Various images scudded before him in a feverish train, one rapidly succeeding the other in his mind. ‘Lise, Lise,’ he thought, ‘and with her, ce Maurice… Strange people… Well, wasn’t that a strange fire, and what were they talking about, and what people were murdered? … I think Stasie hasn’t had time to find out anything yet and is still waiting for me with a cup of coffee… A game of cards? Did I actually lose to some people at cards? Hmm… in this Russia of ours, during the time of so-called serfdom… Oh, my God, and Fedka?’","After the sudden and unexpected meeting with Liza, which I have already described, he went on in even greater self-abandon. The high road passed within a quarter mile of Skvoreshniki, and-strangely-he did not even notice at first how he had come upon it. Sound reasoning, or clear awareness at the least, was unbearable to him at that moment. A drizzling rain kept stopping and starting again; but he did not notice the rain, either. He also did not notice how he had shouldered his bag, and how this made it easier for him to walk. He must have gone a half or three quarters of a mile when he suddenly stopped and looked around. Ahead of him the old, black, and deeply rutted road stretched in an endless thread, planted out with its willows; to the right-a bare place, fields harvested long, long ago; to the left-bushes, and beyond them-woods. And far away-far away the faintly noticeable line of the railroad running obliquely, with the smoke of some train on it; but the sound could no longer be heard. Stepan Trofimovich grew a bit timid, but only for a moment. He sighed aimlessly, placed his bag against a willow, and sat down to rest. As he went to sit down, he felt a chill and wrapped himself in a plaid; then, noticing the rain, he opened the umbrella over him. For quite a long time he went on sitting like that, occasionally munching his lips, the handle of the umbrella grasped tightly in his hand. Various images swept before him in feverish succession, rapidly supplanting one another in his mind. "" Lise, Lise, "" he thought, ""and ce Maurice with her... Strange people... But what was this strange fire there, and what were they talking about, and who was murdered? ... I suppose Stasie hasn't had time to find anything out yet and is still waiting for me with coffee...

"Наконец разместились; утихла и музыка. Стали сморкаться, осматриваться. Ожидали с слишком уже торжественным видом – что уже само по себе всегда дурной признак. Но «Лембок» еще не было. Шелки, бархаты, бриллианты сияли и горели со всех сторон; по воздуху разнеслось благовоние. Мужчины были при всех орденах, а старички так даже в мундирах. Явилась наконец и предводительша, вместе с Лизой. Никогда еще Лиза не была так ослепительно прелестна, как в это утро и в таком пышном туалете. Волосы ее были убраны в локонах, глаза сверкали, на лице сияла улыбка. Она видимо произвела эффект; ее осматривали, про нее шептались. Говорили, что она ищет глазами Ставрогина, но ни Ставрогина, ни Варвары Петровны не было. Я не понял тогда выражения ее лица: почему столько счастья, радости, энергии, силы было в этом лице? Я припоминал вчерашний случай и становился в тупик. Но «Лембков», однако, всё еще не было. Это была уже ошибка. Я после узнал, что Юлия Михайловна до последней минуты ожидала Петра Степановича, без которого в последнее время и ступить не могла, несмотря на то что никогда себе в этом не сознавалась. Замечу в скобках, что Петр Степанович накануне, в последнем комитетском заседании, отказался от распорядительского банта, чем очень ее огорчил, даже до слез. К удивлению, а потом и к чрезвычайному ее смущению (о чем объявляю вперед), он исчез на всё утро и на литературное чтение совсем не явился, так что до самого вечера его никто не встречал. Наконец публика начала обнаруживать явное нетерпение. На эстраде тоже никто не показывался. В задних рядах начали аплодировать, как в театре. Старики и барыни хмурились: «Лембки», очевидно, уже слишком важничали. Даже в лучшей части публики начался нелепый шепот о том, что праздника, пожалуй, и в самом деле не будет, что сам Лембке, пожалуй, и в самом деле так нездоров, и пр., и пр. Но, слава богу, Лембке наконец явились: он вел ее под руку; я, признаюсь, и сам ужасно опасался за их появление. Но басни, стало быть, падали, и правда брала свое. Публика как будто отдохнула. Сам Лембке, казалось, был в полном здоровье, как, помню, заключили и все, потому что можно представить, сколько на него обратилось взглядов. Замечу для характеристики, что и вообще очень мало было таких из нашего высшего общества, которые предполагали, что Лембке чем-нибудь таким нездоров; деяния же его находили совершенно нормальными и даже так, что вчерашнюю утрешнюю историю на площади приняли с одобрением. «Так-то бы и сначала, – говорили сановники. – А то приедут филантропами, а кончат всё тем же, не замечая, что оно для самой филантропии необходимо», – так по крайней мере рассудили в клубе. Осуждали только, что он при этом погорячился. «Это надо бы хладнокровнее, ну да человек внове», – говорили знатоки. С такою же жадностью все взоры обратились и к Юлии Михайловне. Конечно, никто не вправе требовать от меня как от рассказчика слишком точных подробностей касательно одного пункта: тут тайна, тут женщина; но я знаю только одно: ввечеру вчерашнего дня она вошла в кабинет Андрея Антоновича и пробыла с ним гораздо позже полуночи. Андрей Антонович был прощен и утешен. Супруги согласились во всем, всё было забыто, и когда, в конце объяснения, фон Лембке все-таки стал на колени, с ужасом вспоминая о главном заключительном эпизоде запрошлой ночи, то прелестная ручка, а за нею и уста супруги заградили пламенные излияния покаянных речей рыцарски деликатного, но ослабленного умилением человека. Все видели на лице ее счастье. Она шла с открытым видом и в великолепном костюме. Казалось, она была на верху желаний; праздник – цель и венец ее политики – был осуществлен. Проходя до своих мест, пред самою эстрадой, оба Лембке раскланивались и отвечали на поклоны. Они тотчас же были окружены. Предводительница встала им навстречу… Но тут случилось одно скверное недоразумение: оркестр ни с того ни с сего грянул туш, – не какой-нибудь марш, а просто столовый туш, как у нас в клубе за столом, когда на официальном обеде пьют чье-нибудь здоровье. Я теперь знаю, что об этом постарался Лямшин в своем качестве распорядителя, будто бы в честь входящих «Лембок». Конечно, он мог всегда отговориться тем, что сделал по глупости или по чрезмерной ревности… Увы, я еще не знал тогда, что они об отговорках уже не заботились и с сегодняшним днем всё заканчивали. Но тушем не кончилось: вместе с досадным недоумением и улыбками публики вдруг в конце залы и на хорах раздалось ура, тоже как бы в честь Лембке. Голосов было немного, но, признаюсь, они продолжались некоторое время. Юлия Михайловна вспыхнула, глаза ее засверкали. Лембке остановился у своего места и, обернувшись в сторону кричавших, величественно и строго оглядывал залу… Его поскорее посадили. Я опять со страхом приметил на его лице ту опасную улыбку, с которою он стоял вчера поутру в гостиной своей супруги и смотрел на Степана Трофимовича, прежде чем к нему подошел. Мне показалось, что и теперь в его лице какое-то зловещее выражение и, что хуже всего, несколько комическое, – выражение существа, приносящего, так и быть, себя в жертву, чтобы только угодить высшим целям своей супруги… Юлия Михайловна наскоро поманила меня к себе и прошептала, чтоб я бежал к Кармазинову и умолял его начинать. И вот, только что я успел повернуться, произошла другая мерзость, но только гораздо сквернее первой. На эстраде, на пустой эстраде, куда до сей минуты обращались все взоры и все ожидания и где только и видели небольшой стол, пред ним стул, а на столе стакан воды на серебряном подносике, – на пустой эстраде вдруг мелькнула колоссальная фигура капитана Лебядкина во фраке и в белом галстуке. Я так был поражен, что не поверил глазам своим. Капитан, казалось, сконфузился и приостановился в углублении эстрады. Вдруг в публике послышался крик: «Лебядкин! ты?» Глупая красная рожа капитана (он был совершенно пьян) при этом оклике раздвинулась широкою тупою улыбкой. Он поднял руку, потер ею лоб, тряхнул своею мохнатою головой и, как будто решившись на всё, шагнул два шага вперед и – вдруг фыркнул смехом, не громким, но заливчатым, длинным, счастливым, от которого заколыхалась вся его дебелая масса и съежились глазки. При этом виде чуть не половина публики засмеялась, двадцать человек зааплодировали. Публика серьезная мрачно переглядывалась; всё, однако, продолжалось не более полуминуты. На эстраду вдруг взбежали Липутин с своим распорядительским бантом и двое слуг; они осторожно подхватили капитана под руки, а Липутин что-то пошептал ему. Капитан нахмурился, пробормотал: «А ну, коли так», махнул рукой, повернул к публике свою огромную спину и скрылся с провожатыми. Но мгновение спустя Липутин опять вскочил на эстраду. На губах его была самая сладчайшая из всегдашних его улыбок, обыкновенно напоминающих уксус с сахаром, а в руках листок почтовой бумаги. Мелкими, но частыми шагами подошел он к переднему краю эстрады.","Finally settled down; the music also subsided. They began to sniffle, look around. They waited with a too solemn look - which in itself is always a bad sign. But there was no Lembok yet. Silks, velvets, diamonds shone and burned from all sides; incense wafted through the air. Men were with all the orders, and the old men were even in uniforms. Finally the leader appeared, along with Liza. Liza had never been so dazzlingly charming as she was this morning and in such a magnificent dress. Her hair was tied up in curls, her eyes sparkled, a smile shone on her face. She apparently had an effect; they examined her, they whispered about her. They said that she was looking for Stavrogin through her eyes, but neither Stavrogin nor Varvara Petrovna was there. I did not understand then the expression of her face: why was there so much happiness, joy, energy, strength in this face? I remembered yesterday's incident and became stumped. But there were still no Lembkovs, however. It was already a mistake. Later I learned that Yulia Mihailovna had been waiting until the last minute for Pyotr Stepanovich, without whom of late she could not even set foot, despite the fact that she had never admitted it to herself. Let me note parenthetically that Pyotr Stepanovich the day before, at the last committee meeting, had renounced the manager's bow, which upset her greatly, even to the point of tears. To her surprise, and then to her extreme embarrassment (which I will announce in advance), he disappeared for the whole morning and did not appear at all for the literary reading, so that no one met him until evening. Finally, the public began to show obvious impatience. No one showed up on the stage either. In the back rows they began to applaud, as in a theater. The old men and ladies frowned: ""Lembki"", obviously, already put on too much air. Even in the best part of the audience, an absurd whisper began that the holiday, perhaps, in fact, would not happen, that Lembke himself, perhaps, was really so unwell, etc., etc. But, thank God, Lembke finally appeared: he led her by the arm; I confess that I myself was terribly afraid for their appearance. But fables, therefore, fell, and the truth took its toll. The audience seemed to rest. Lembke himself seemed to be in perfect health, as, I remember, everyone concluded, because one can imagine how many glances turned to him. For the sake of characterization, I note that in general there were very few people from our high society who suggested that Lembke was somehow so unwell; his deeds were considered completely normal, and even in such a way that yesterday's morning story was accepted with approval in the square. “So it would be at first,” said the dignitaries. “Otherwise, they will come as philanthropists, but they will end up the same, not noticing that it is necessary for philanthropy itself,” at least the club reasoned. They only condemned that he got excited at the same time. “It should be cooler, but yes, the man is new,” experts said. With the same greed all eyes turned to Yulia Mihailovna. Of course, no one has the right to demand from me, as a narrator, too precise details on one point: here is a mystery, here is a woman; but I know only one thing: yesterday evening she went into Andrey Antonovich's office and stayed with him much later than midnight. Andrei Antonovich was forgiven and comforted. The couple agreed on everything, everything was forgotten, and when, at the end of the explanation, von Lembke nevertheless knelt down, recalling with horror the main final episode of the night before, the lovely pen, and behind it the lips of the wife, blocked the fiery outpourings of repentant speeches chivalrously delicate, but weakened by tenderness of a person. Everyone saw the happiness on her face. She walked with an open view and in a magnificent costume. She seemed to be at the height of her desires; the holiday - the goal and crown of her policy - was realized. Passing to their seats, in front of the stage itself, both Lembkes bowed and returned their bows. They were immediately surrounded. The leader stood up to meet them ... But then one nasty misunderstanding happened: the orchestra, for no reason at all, struck out a carcass - not some kind of march, but just a table carcass, like at our club at the table, when someone’s drink is drunk at an official dinner health. I now know that Lyamshin tried to do this in his capacity as manager, as if in honor of the incoming Lembok. Of course, he could always excuse himself by what he did out of stupidity or out of excessive jealousy ... Alas, I didn’t know then that they no longer cared about excuses and ended everything with today. But the carcass did not end: together with the unfortunate bewilderment and smiles of the public, suddenly at the end of the hall and in the choirs there was a cheer, also, as it were, in honor of Lembke. There were few voices, but, I confess, they continued for some time. Yulia Mihailovna flushed, her eyes sparkled. Lembke stopped at his place and, turning in the direction of those who were shouting, majestically and sternly looked around the hall ... He was quickly seated. Again, with fear, I noticed on his face that dangerous smile with which he stood yesterday morning in his wife's drawing room and looked at Stepan Trofimovich before he approached him. It seemed to me that even now there was some ominous expression in his face, and, worst of all, somewhat comical, the expression of a being who, so be it, sacrifices himself in order to please the highest goals of his wife ... Yulia Mikhailovna hastily beckoned me to herself and whispered that I should run to Karmazinov and beg him to start. And just as I had time to turn around, another abomination happened, but only much worse than the first. On the stage, on the empty stage, where until now all eyes and all expectations have been turned, and where only they have seen a small table, a chair in front of it, and on the table a glass of water on a silver tray, the colossal figure of Captain Lebyadkin in a tailcoat suddenly flashed on the empty stage. and in a white tie. I was so amazed that I could not believe my eyes. The captain seemed embarrassed and paused in the deepening of the platform. Suddenly a shout was heard in the audience: “Lebyadkin! you?"" The captain's stupid red mug (he was completely drunk) parted at this call into a broad stupid smile. He raised his hand, rubbed his forehead with it, shook his shaggy head and, as if having decided on everything, took two steps forward and suddenly snorted with laughter, not loud, but flooded, long, happy, from which his whole plump mass swayed and his eyes shrank. . At this sight, almost half of the audience laughed, twenty people applauded. The serious audience looked at each other gloomily; all, however, lasted no more than half a minute. Liputin suddenly ran up onto the platform with his steward's bow and two servants; they carefully took the captain by the arms, and Liputin whispered something to him. The captain frowned, muttered: “Well, if so,” waved his hand, turned his huge back to the public and disappeared with the escort. But a moment later Liputin again jumped onto the stage. On his lips was the sweetest of his usual smiles, usually reminiscent of vinegar and sugar, and in his hands was a sheet of note paper. With small but frequent steps he approached the front edge of the stage.","Finally, people took their seats; and the music stopped. People began blowing their noses and looking about. They were waiting with too solemn an air, which was already a bad sign in itself. But as yet there were no ‘Lembkas’. Silks, velvets, diamonds sparkled and glowed on all sides; fragrance wafted through the air. The men were wearing all their decorations, and the little old men were even in uniform. At last the marshal’s wife appeared, together with Liza. Liza had never yet been so dazzlingly lovely as on that morning and in such elegant attire. Her hair had been done up in curls, her eyes were sparkling, a smile shone on her face. She visibly produced an impression; people were inspecting her, and whispering about her. They were saying that her eyes were seeking out Stavrogin, but neither Stavrogin nor Varvara Petrovna was there. I didn’t understand the expression on her face just then: why was there so much happiness, joy, energy, strength in this face? I remembered the incident of the day before, and didn’t know what to make of it. But still and all, the ‘Lembkas’ hadn’t yet appeared. This was a great mistake. I later learned that until the last moment Yuliya Mikhaylovna was waiting for Pyotr Stepanovich, without whom recently she had been unable to take a step, even though she would never have admitted it. I will note parenthetically that the night before, at the final meeting of the committee, Pyotr Stepanovich had refused to put on a steward’s rosette, which had offended her, even to the point of tears. To her surprise, and then to her extreme embarrassment (of which I will have something to say later), he disappeared for the entire morning, and didn’t show up for the literary reading at all, and no one ran across him until that evening. Finally, the public began to display obvious impatience. No one appeared on the platform either. In the back rows they began to clap, as in a theatre. The old men and young ladies frowned; the ‘Lembkas’ were obviously putting on airs. Even among the more respectable members of the public an absurd whispering began to the effect that there would perhaps be no gala at all, that von Lembke himself was perhaps really unwell, and so on and so forth. But thank heaven von Lembke finally appeared. He was leading her by the arm; I myself admit that I was dreadfully worried that they might not appear. But the fact was that the fairy tales were evaporating, and the truth was coming into its own. The public seemed to relax. Von Lembke himself seemed to be in perfect health, as, I remember, everyone else also concluded, because you can imagine how many eyes were turned on him. I will mention, by way of characterizing our society, that in general there were very few in the upper ranks who supposed that von Lembke was at all ill; they found his actions perfectly normal, and even looked approvingly on yesterday morning’s incident in the square. ‘ That’s how it should have been done from the start,’ said the worthies. ‘Otherwise if they come as philanthropists, they’ll end up the same way, without noticing that it’s necessary from a philanthropic standpoint to begin with.’ That at least was how the thinking went in the club. The only fault they found was that he had lost his temper in the process. ‘Something like that has to be done more coolly, but he’s new at the job,’ said those in the know. All eyes turned to Yuliya Mikhaylovna with the same eagerness. Of course, no one has the right to demand of me, the narrator, extremely precise details concerning one point: there’s a mystery involved here , there’s a woman involved. But I know only one thing: the evening of the previous day she went into Andrey Antonovich’s study and stayed with him well past midnight. Andrey Antonovich was forgiven and consoled. The spouses agreed on everything, everything was forgotten and when, at the conclusion of their discussion, von Lembke did kneel before her, as he remembered with horror the main and final episode of the previous night, his spouse’s charming little hand, and after it her lips, checked the impassioned outpourings of the contrite speeches of a man who was chivalrously delicate but weakened by emotion. Everyone could see happiness on her face now. She walked with an open expression and was magnificently turned out. She seemed to be at the pinnacle of her desires; the gala — the goal and crown of her diplomacy — had come into being. As they proceeded to their places, directly in front of the platform, both von Lembkes were bowing and responding to bows. They were instantly surrounded. The marshal’s wife got up to greet them. But at this point a nasty misunderstanding occurred: the orchestra, for no earthly reason, struck up a flourish — not a march, but simply a flourish of the kind that is played in our club when someone’s health is being drunk at the dinner table. I now know that Lyamshin was responsible for this in his capacity as a steward, supposedly in honour of the ‘Lembkas’ as they were making their entrance. Of course, he could always have excused himself by saying that he’d done it out of stupidity or excessive zeal. Alas, I didn’t yet know at the time that they no longer cared for excuses, and that that day marked the end of all such things. But the flourish wasn’t the end of it: along with the annoyance, perplexity and smiles of the public came a sudden shout of ‘hurrah’ at the end of the hall and in the gallery, also supposedly in honour of von Lembke. There were not many voices, but I confess they continued for some time. Yuliya Mikhaylovna flushed, and her eyes began to flash. Von Lembke stopped by his seat, and turning in the direction of those who were shouting, surveyed the hall majestically and sternly. He was quickly shown to his seat. Again I noticed with apprehension the same dangerous smile on his face that he’d worn yesterday morning as he stood in his wife’s drawing room looking at Stepan Trofimovich before going up to him. It seemed to me that now, too, there was a sinister expression on his face and, what was worse, a rather comic one — the expression of a being who was bent on sacrificing himself merely to serve his wife’s lofty purposes. Yuliya Mikhaylovna quickly beckoned me to come to her, and whispered that I should run to Karmazinov and beg him to begin. And then, no sooner had I turned around when another disgraceful incident occurred, except that it was much nastier than the first. On the platform, on the empty platform, to which all eyes and all expectations had been directed until that moment, and where the only things to be seen were a small table, a chair in front of it, and on the table a glass of water on a silver tray — on the empty platform there suddenly appeared out of the blue the gigantic figure of Captain Lebyadkin in a tail-coat and white tie. I was so astonished that I couldn’t believe my eyes. The captain seemed to be confused and remained standing at the back of the platform. Suddenly someone from the audience shouted ‘Lebyadkin! Is that you?’ At this, the captain’s stupid red face (he was dead drunk) spread into a broad, vacant smile. He raised his hand, wiped his forehead with it, shook his shaggy head and, as if throwing caution to the winds, took two steps forward and suddenly snorted with laughter, which, though not loud, was pealing, prolonged and merry, and set his whole corpulent mass to heaving and his little eyes to squinting. Nearly half the audience began to laugh at this sight, and twenty people began to applaud. The serious members of the audience exchanged gloomy glances; however, it all lasted less than half a minute. Suddenly Liputin, with his steward’s rosette and accompanied by two servants, rushed on to the platform. They carefully grabbed the captain under the arms, and Liputin whispered something to him. The captain frowned and muttered: ‘ Oh, well, if that’s the way it is’, waved his hand dismissively, turned his enormous back to the audience and disappeared with his escorts. But a moment later Liputin again leaped out on to the platform. His lips wore the very sweetest of his perpetual smiles, which were especially reminiscent of vinegar mixed with sugar, and in his hand he held a sheet of notepaper. With small but quick steps he approached the edge of the platform.","Finally all were seated; the music also died down. People began blowing their noses, looking around. They were altogether too solemnly expectant-which is always a bad sign in itself. But the ""Lembkas"" were still not there. Silks, velvets, diamonds shone and sparkled on all sides; fragrance permeated the air. The men were wearing all their decorations, and the old men were even wearing their uniforms. Finally, the marshal's wife also appeared, together with Liza. Never before had Liza been so dazzlingly lovely as that morning, or so magnificently attired. Her hair was done up in curls, her eyes flashed, a smile shone on her face. She produced a visible effect; she was looked over, whispered about. People said she was seeking Stavrogin with her eyes, but neither Stavrogin nor Varvara Petrovna was there. I did not then understand the expression of her face: why was there so much happiness, joy, energy, strength in this face? I kept recalling yesterday's event, and was nonplussed. The ""Lembkas,"" however, were still not there. This was indeed a mistake. I learned afterwards that Yulia Mikhailovna had waited till the last minute for Pyotr Stepanovich, without whom she could not take a step lately, though she never admitted it to herself. I will note in parenthesis that at the last committee meeting, the previous day, Pyotr Stepanovich had refused the usher's bow, which had upset her very much, even to tears. To her surprise, and afterwards to her great embarrassment (which I announce beforehand), he disappeared for the whole morning and did not come to the literary reading at all, so that no one met him until that same evening. Finally, the public began to show obvious impatience. No one appeared on the platform, either. In the back rows people began clapping as in a theater. Old men and ladies were frowning: the ""Lembkas"" were obviously giving themselves too many airs. Even among the best part of the public an absurd whispering began, that perhaps the fête would indeed not take place, that perhaps Lembke himself was indeed quite unwell, and so on and so forth. But, thank God, the Lembkes finally appeared, he leading her by the arm-I confess, I myself was terribly worried about their appearance. But the fables thus were falling, and truth was claiming its own. The public seemed relieved. Lembke himself, apparently, was in perfect health, as I recall everyone else also concluded, for one can imagine how many eyes were turned on him. I will note as characteristic that generally very few people in our higher society supposed that Lembke was somehow not quite well; and his deeds were found perfectly normal, so much so that even the previous day's episode in the square was received with approval. ""Should've done it that way from the start,"" the dignitaries said. ""But no, they come as philanthropists and end up with the same thing, without noticing that it's necessary for philanthropy itself-so at least they reasoned in the club. They only blamed him for getting into a temper over it. ""One has to keep cool, but after all the man is new at it,"" the connoisseurs said. With equal greediness all eyes turned to Yulia Mikhailovna as well. Of course, no one has the right to demand of me as a narrator too detailed an account of one point: here is mystery, here is woman; but one thing I do know: the previous evening she had gone into Andrei Antonovich's study and was with him till well past midnight. Andrei Antonovich was forgiven and consoled. The spouses agreed in all things, everything was forgotten, and when at the end of their talk von Lembke did go on his knees all the same, remembering with horror the main concluding episode of the previous night, the lovely little hand, and after it the lips, of his spouse blocked the fiery outpouring of penitent speeches of a man chivalrously delicate, yet weakened by tenderness. Everyone saw happiness on her face. She walked with a candid air and in a splendid dress. It seemed she was at the summit of her desires, the fête-the goal and crown of her politics-was realized. As they proceeded to their places just in front of the platform, both Lembkes were bowing and responding to others' bows. They were surrounded at once. The marshal's wife rose to meet them... But here a nasty misunderstanding occurred: the orchestra, out of the blue, burst into a flourish-not some sort of march, but simply a dinnertime flourish, as at table in our club, when they drink someone's health during an official banquet. I know now that this was owing to the good services of Lyamshin, in his capacity as usher, supposedly to honor the entrance of the ""Lembkas. "" Of course, he could always make the excuse that he had done it out of stupidity or excessive zeal. . . Alas, I did not yet know that by then they were no longer worried about making excuses, and that that day was to put an end to everything. But the flourish was not the end of it: along with the vexatious bewilderment and smiling of the public, suddenly, from the end of the hall and from the gallery there came a hurrah, also as if in honor of the Lembkes. The voices were few, but I confess they lasted for some time. Yulia Mikhailovna turned red; her eyes flashed. Lembke had stopped by his place and, turning in the direction of those who were shouting, was grandly and sternly surveying the hall... He was quickly seated. I noticed with fear that same dangerous smile on his face with which he had stood yesterday morning in his wife's drawing room and looked at Stepan Trofimovich before going up to him. It seemed to me that now, too, there was some ominous expression on his face, and, worst of all, a slightly comical one, the expression of a being who is offering himself-oh, very well- as a sacrifice, only to play up to the higher aims of his wife... Yulia Mikhailovna hastily beckoned me to her and whispered that I should run to Karmazinov and beg him to begin. No sooner had I turned around than another abomination occurred, only much nastier than the first one. On the platform, on the empty platform, to which till that moment all eyes and all expectations had been turned, and where all that could be seen was a small table, a chair before it, and on the table a glass of water on a little silver tray-on this empty platform suddenly flashed the colossal figure of Captain Lebyadkin in a tailcoat and white tie. I was so struck that I did not believe my eyes. The captain, it seems, became abashed and halted at the rear of the platform. Suddenly, from amid the public, a shout was heard: ""Lebyadkin! you?"" The captain's stupid red mug (he was totally drunk) spread at this cry into a broad, dumb smile. He raised his hand, rubbed his forehead with it, shook his shaggy head, and, as if venturing all, stepped two steps forward and- suddenly snorted with laughter, not loud but long, happy, rippling, which sent his whole fleshy mass heaving and made his little eyes shrink. At the sight of this, nearly half the public laughed, twenty people applauded. The serious public gloomily exchanged glances; all this, however, lasted no more than half a minute. Suddenly Liputin with his usher's bow and two servants ran out on the platform; they carefully took the captain under both arms, while Liputin did a bit of whispering in his ear. The captain frowned, muttered "" Ah, well, in that case,"" waved his hand, turned his enormous back to the public, and disappeared with his escort. But a moment later Liputin again jumped out on the platform. On his lips was the sweetest of his perennial smiles, which usually resembled vinegar and sugar, and in his hands was a sheet of writing paper. With small but rapid steps he came to the edge of the platform."

"Последних слов даже нельзя было и расслышать за ревом толпы. Видно было, как он опять поднял руку и победоносно еще раз опустил ее. Восторг перешел все пределы: вопили, хлопали в ладоши, даже иные из дам кричали: «Довольно! Лучше ничего не скажете!» Были как пьяные. Оратор обводил всех глазами и как бы таял в собственном торжестве. Я видел мельком, что Лембке в невыразимом волнении кому-то что-то указывал. Юлия Михайловна, вся бледная, торопливо говорила о чем-то подбежавшему к ней князю… Но в эту минуту целая толпа, человек в шесть, лиц более или менее официальных, ринулась из-за кулис на эстраду, подхватила оратора и повлекла за кулисы.

Тут в первый раз бросились ему в глаза некоторые буфетные личности; взгляд его выразил чрезвычайное удивление. Вдруг раздался громкий смех над одною проделкой в кадрили: издатель «грозного непетербургского издания», танцевавший с дубиной в руках, почувствовав окончательно, что не может вынести на себе очков «честной русской мысли», и не зная, куда от нее деваться, вдруг, в последней фигуре, пошел навстречу очкам вверх ногами, что, кстати, и должно было обозначать постоянное извращение вверх ногами здравого смысла в «грозном непетербургском издании». Так как один Лямшин умел ходить вверх ногами, то он и взялся представлять издателя с дубиной. Юлия Михайловна решительно не знала, что будут ходить вверх ногами. «От меня это утаили, утаили», – повторяла она мне потом в отчаянии и негодовании.

Suddenly there was loud laughter over one antic of the quadrille: the publisher of the ""formidable non-Petersburg publication,"" who was dancing with a club in his hands, feeling finally that he could no longer endure the spectacles of ""honest Russian thought"" fixed on him, and not knowing where to hide, suddenly, during the last figure, went to meet the spectacles walking upside down-which, incidentally, was to signify the constant turning upside down of common sense in the ""formidable non-Petersburg publication."" Since Lyamshin was the only one who knew how to walk upside down, he had undertaken to represent the publisher with the club. Yulia Mikhailovna was decidedly unaware that there was going to be any walking upside down. ""They concealed it from me, they concealed it,"" she repeated to me afterwards, in despair and indignation. The guffawing of the crowd greeted, of course, not the allegory, which nobody cared about, but simply the walking upside down in a coat with tails. Lembke boiled over and started shaking."

"В восьмом часу вечера, когда уже совсем стемнело, на краю города, в Фомином переулке, в маленьком покривившемся домике, в квартире прапорщика Эркеля, собрались наши в полном комплекте, впятером. Общее собрание назначено было тут самим Петром Степановичем; но он непростительно опоздал, и члены ждали его уже час. Этот прапорщик Эркель был тот самый заезжий офицерик, который на вечере у Виргинского просидел всё время с карандашом в руках и с записною книжкой пред собою. В город он прибыл недавно, нанимал уединенно в глухом переулке у двух сестер, старух мещанок, и скоро должен был уехать; собраться у него было всего неприметнее. Этот странный мальчик отличался необыкновенною молчаливостью; он мог просидеть десять вечеров сряду в шумной компании и при самых необыкновенных разговорах, сам не говоря ни слова, а напротив, с чрезвычайным вниманием следя своими детскими глазами за говорившими и слушая. Лицо у него было прехорошенькое и даже как бы умное. К пятерке он не принадлежал; наши предполагали, что он имел какие-то и откуда-то особые поручения, чисто по исполнительной части. Теперь известно, что у него не было никаких поручений, да и вряд ли сам он понимал свое положение. Он только преклонился пред Петром Степановичем, встретив его незадолго. Если б он встретился с каким-нибудь преждевременно развращенным монстром и тот под каким-нибудь социально-романическим предлогом подбил его основать разбойничью шайку и для пробы велел убить и ограбить первого встречного мужика, то он непременно бы пошел и послушался. У него была где-то больная мать, которой он отсылал половину своего скудного жалованья, – и как, должно быть, она целовала эту бедную белокурую головку, как дрожала за нее, как молилась о ней! Я потому так много о нем распространяюсь, что мне его очень жаль.","At eight o'clock in the evening, when it was already completely dark, on the edge of the city, in Fomin Lane, in a small crooked house, in the apartment of Ensign Erkel, ours gathered in full, five of us. The general meeting was appointed here by Pyotr Stepanovich himself; but he was inexcusably late, and the members had been waiting for him for an hour. This warrant officer Erkel was the same visiting officer who, at Virginsky's, sat all the time with a pencil in his hand and a notebook in front of him. He had recently arrived in the city; to gather at his place was the most inconspicuous. This strange boy was notable for his unusual taciturnity; he could sit ten evenings in a row in noisy company and with the most unusual conversations, without saying a word himself, but on the contrary, with extraordinary attention, with his childlike eyes, following those who spoke and listening. His face was very pretty and even, as it were, intelligent. He did not belong to the five; ours assumed that he had some special assignments from somewhere, purely on the executive side. It is now known that he did not have any assignments, and it is unlikely that he himself understood his position. He only bowed before Pyotr Stepanovich, meeting him shortly. If he met with some prematurely corrupted monster, and under some social-romantic pretext, he incited him to found a band of robbers and, as a test, ordered him to kill and rob the first peasant he met, then he would certainly go and obey. He had a sick mother somewhere, to whom he sent half of his meager salary - and how she must have kissed that poor blond head, how she trembled for her, how she prayed for her! I am talking about him so much because I feel very sorry for him.","Between seven and eight that evening, when it had already grown completely dark, our people assembled, all five of them, on the edge of town, in Fomin Lane, in a crooked little house, in the tiny apartment of Ensign Erkel.

He didn’t belong to the group of five; our people supposed that he had some special instructions from somewhere, of a purely executive nature. Now it’s known that he had no instructions at all, and, what’s more, that he barely understood his position. It was just that he worshipped Pyotr Stepanovich, having met him not too long before. If he had encountered some prematurely depraved monster who, on some social and romantic pretext, put him up to forming a band of robbers and ordered him as a test to kill and rob the first muzhik he came across, he wouldn’t have hesitated to obey and would have gone and done it. He had an ailing mother somewhere, to whom he sent half of his meagre pay — and how she must have kissed this poor little blond head, worried about it, prayed for it!

"Во-первых, розги явились как-то уж слишком поспешно; очевидно, были в ожидании припасены догадливым полицеймейстером. Наказаны, впрочем, были всего двое, не думаю, чтобы даже трое; на этом настаиваю. Сущая выдумка, что наказаны были все или по крайней мере половина людей. Вздор тоже, что будто бы какая-то проходившая мимо бедная, но благородная дама была схвачена и немедленно для чего-то высечена; между тем я сам читал об этой даме спустя в корреспонденции одной из петербургских газет. Многие говорили у нас о какой-то кладбищенской богаделенке, Авдотье Петровне Тарапыгиной, что будто бы она, возвращаясь из гостей назад в свою богадельню и проходя по площади, протеснилась между зрителями, из естественного любопытства, и, видя происходящее, воскликнула: «Экой страм!» – и плюнула. За это ее будто бы подхватили и тоже «отрапортовали». Об этом случае не только напечатали, но даже устроили у нас в городе сгоряча ей подписку. Я сам подписал двадцать копеек. И что же? Оказывается теперь, что никакой такой богаделенки Тарапыгиной совсем у нас и не было! Я сам ходил справляться в их богадельню на кладбище: ни о какой Тарапыгиной там и не слыхивали; мало того, очень обиделись, когда я рассказал им ходивший слух. Я же потому, собственно, упоминаю об этой несуществовавшей Авдотье Петровне, что со Степаном Трофимовичем чуть-чуть не случилось того же, что и с нею (в случае, если б та существовала в действительности); даже, может быть, с него-то как-нибудь и взялся весь этот нелепый слух о Тарапыгиной, то есть просто в дальнейшем развитии сплетни взяли да и переделали его в какую-то Тарапыгину. Главное, не понимаю, каким образом он от меня ускользнул, только что мы с ним вышли на площадь. Предчувствуя что-то очень недоброе, я хотел было обвести его кругом площади прямо к губернаторскому крыльцу, но залюбопытствовался сам и остановился лишь на одну минуту расспросить какого-то первого встречного, и вдруг смотрю, Степана Трофимовича уж нет подле меня. По инстинкту тотчас же бросился я искать его в самом опасном месте; мне почему-то предчувствовалось, что и у него санки полетели с горы. И действительно, он отыскался уже в самом центре события. Помню, я схватил его за руку; но он тихо и гордо посмотрел на меня с непомерным авторитетом:","Firstly, the rods appeared somehow too hastily; evidently had been stockpiled in anticipation by the shrewd police chief. However, only two were punished, I don’t think even three; I insist on it. Sheer fiction that all or at least half of the people were punished. It is also nonsense that some poor but noble lady who was passing by was seized and immediately whipped for some reason; meanwhile, I myself read about this lady later in the correspondence of one of the Petersburg newspapers. Many of us talked about some kind of cemetery almshouse, Avdotya Petrovna Tarapygina, that as if she, returning from the guests back to her almshouse and passing through the square, pushed her way between the audience, out of natural curiosity, and, seeing what was happening, exclaimed: “What a fear! !"" – and spat. For this, she was allegedly picked up and also “reported”. This case was not only published, but even a subscription was rashly arranged for her in our city. I myself signed twenty kopecks. And what? It turns out now that we never had any such almshouse Tarapygina at all! I myself went to inquire at their almshouse at the cemetery: they never heard of any Tarapygina there; moreover, they were very offended when I told them the rumour. Actually, I mention this non-existent Avdotya Petrovna because the same thing almost happened to Stepan Trofimovich as to her (if she really existed); maybe even this whole ridiculous rumor about Tarapygina somehow came from him, that is, in the further development of gossip, they took it and remade him into some kind of Tarapygina. The main thing is that I don’t understand how he eluded me, we had just entered the square with him. Anticipating something very unkind, I wanted to circle him around the square straight to the governor's porch, but I myself became curious and stopped only for one minute to question some first person I met, and suddenly I saw that Stepan Trofimovich was no longer beside me. By instinct, I immediately rushed to look for him in the most dangerous place; for some reason I had a presentiment that his sled, too, flew down the mountain. Indeed, he was found already in the very center of the event. I remember I grabbed his hand; but he quietly and proudly looked at me with exorbitant authority:","In the first place, the birch rods appeared rather too quickly: evidently they had been prepared in advance by the resourceful chief of police. However, no more than two men were punished, I don’t think that even three were. I stand by that. It’s pure fabrication to say that everyone was punished, or at least half the people. It’s also nonsense to say that some poor but genteel lady who was just passing by was arrested and immediately flogged for something, and yet I myself later read about this lady in a report in one of the Petersburg papers. Many people in our town were talking about a certain Avdotya Petrovna Tarapygina, who lived in an almshouse by the cemetery, and who supposedly, while returning to the almshouse from a visit and passing through the open square, squeezed between the onlookers, out of natural curiosity, and seeing what was going on, exclaimed: ‘What a shame!’ and spat in disgust. For that she was supposedly seized and flogged as well. Not only was this incident put into print, but in the town a collection was taken up for her in the heat of the moment. I myself subscribed twenty kopecks. And then what happened? It now turns out that no one named Tarapygina was living in the almshouse at all! I myself went to the cemetery to make inquiries at their almshouse. No one there had even heard of any Tarapygina; what’s more, they were very offended when I told them of the gossip that was circulating. In fact, I am mentioning this nonexistent Avdotya Petrovna only because the same thing (in the event that she really did exist) almost happened to Stepan Trofimovich. It may even be that he was somehow responsible for this whole absurd rumour about Tarapygina; that is, the gossip, as it went on developing, proceeded to recast him in the form of some Tarapygina or other. The main thing was that I don’t understand how he gave me the slip as soon as we came out on to the square. Having a premonition that something bad was going to happen, I wanted to lead him around the square directly to the governor’s front door, but he himself grew curious and stopped for just a minute to ask something of the first person he met, and suddenly I looked and Stepan Trofimovich was no longer beside me. Guided by my instinct I immediately ran to look for him in the most dangerous place; I somehow felt in my bones that his sled too had come careening down the mountain. And in fact, he was now to be found in the very centre of things. I remember that I grabbed him by the arm, but he looked at me quietly and proudly, and, with enormous authority:","First, the birch rods appeared somehow all too hastily; they had apparently been readied in advance by the quick-witted police chief.

It is also nonsense that some poor but noble lady was supposedly seized as she was passing by and promptly thrashed for some reason; and yet I later read about this lady myself in a report in one of the Petersburg newspapers.

For this she was supposedly picked up and also ""attended to. "" Not only was this case printed, but a subscription for her benefit was set up here in town on the spur of the moment. I myself donated twenty kopecks. And what then? It turns out that there never was any such almshouse Tarapygin woman in our town at all!

Он явился к Николаю Всеволодовичу тотчас после объяснения того с мамашей и убедительно просил его сделать честь пожаловать к нему в тот же день на вечеринку по поводу дня рождения его жены.

Он уже и кроме того завел несколько знакомств в этом третьестепенном слое нашего общества и даже еще ниже, – но уж такую имел наклонность.

"– Николай Всеволодович, посудите, посудите!.. – и в отчаянии, в слезах капитан начал торопливо излагать свою повесть за все четыре года. Это была глупейшая повесть о дураке, втянувшемся не в свое дело и почти не понимавшем его важности до самой последней минуты, за пьянством и за гульбой. Он рассказал, что еще в Петербурге «увлекся спервоначалу, просто по дружбе, как верный студент, хотя и не будучи студентом», и, не зная ничего, «ни в чем не повинный», разбрасывал разные бумажки на лестницах, оставлял десятками у дверей, у звонков, засовывал вместо газет, в театр проносил, в шляпы совал, в карманы пропускал. А потом и деньги стал от них получать, «потому что средства-то, средства-то мои каковы-с!». В двух губерниях по уездам разбрасывал «всякую дрянь». – О, Николай Всеволодович, – восклицал он, – всего более возмущало меня, что это совершенно противно гражданским и преимущественно отечественным законам! Напечатано вдруг, чтобы выходили с вилами и чтобы помнили, что кто выйдет поутру бедным, может вечером воротиться домой богатым, – подумайте-с! Самого содрогание берет, а разбрасываю. Или вдруг пять-шесть строк ко всей России, ни с того ни с сего: «Запирайте скорее церкви, уничтожайте бога, нарушайте браки, уничтожайте права наследства, берите ножи», и только, и черт знает что дальше. Вот с этою бумажкой, с пятистрочною-то, я чуть не попался, в полку офицеры поколотили, да, дай бог здоровья, выпустили. А там прошлого года чуть не захватили, как я пятидесятирублевые французской подделки Короваеву передал; да, слава богу, Короваев как раз пьяный в пруду утонул к тому времени, и меня не успели изобличить. Здесь у Виргинского провозглашал свободу социальной жены. В июне месяце опять в –ском уезде разбрасывал. Говорят, еще заставят… Петр Степанович вдруг дает знать, что я должен слушаться; давно уже угрожает. Ведь как он в воскресенье тогда поступил со мной! Николай Всеволодович, я раб, я червь, но не бог, тем только и отличаюсь от Державина. Но ведь средства-то, средства-то мои каковы!","- Nikolai Vsevolodovich, judge, judge! .. - and in despair, in tears, the captain began hastily recounting his story for all four years. It was a stupid story about a fool who got involved in something other than his own and hardly understood its importance until the very last minute, for drunkenness and revelry. He said that even in St. Petersburg ""he got carried away at first, just out of friendship, like a faithful student, although not being a student,"" and, not knowing anything, ""guilty of nothing,"" scattered various pieces of paper on the stairs, left dozens at the door , at the bells, put it instead of newspapers, carried it into the theater, put it in hats, passed it into pockets. And then he began to receive money from them, “because the funds, my funds, are what they are!” In two provinces, he scattered ""all sorts of rubbish"" around the counties. “Oh, Nikolai Vsevolodovich,” he exclaimed, “what revolted me most of all was that this was completely contrary to civil and mainly domestic laws! It was printed all of a sudden so that they would go out with pitchforks and to remember that whoever goes out poor in the morning can return home rich in the evening—think about it! The shudder takes itself, but I scatter it. Or suddenly five or six lines to all of Russia, all of a sudden: “Lock the churches, destroy God, break marriages, destroy inheritance rights, take knives,” and nothing more, and the devil knows what’s next. With this piece of paper, with a five-line one, I almost got caught, the officers beat me up in the regiment, yes, God forbid, they let me out. And there they almost captured last year, as I handed over fifty-ruble French fakes to Korovaev; yes, thank God, Korovaev just drowned in the pond drunk by that time, and they did not have time to expose me.

But what are my means, what are my means!","‘Nikolay Vsevolodovich, just consider, just consider!’ And in despair, in tears the captain began hastily laying out the story of his life for the four years past. It was the extremely stupid story of a fool who had been drawn into something that was not his business and who had virtually no understanding of its importance until the very last minute, on account of his drinking and carousing. He related how while still in Petersburg he had ‘got carried away, first off just for friendship’s sake, like a real student, although he was not a student’, and without knowing anything, ‘and not guilty of anything’, he distributed various papers on stairways, left them in doorways and on doorbells by the dozens, shoved them in instead of newspapers, took them to theatres, thrust them into hats, stuck them into pockets. And then he also began receiving money from them ‘because my financial situation, my financial situation was such, sir!’ He distributed ‘all sorts of rubbish’ throughout the districts of two provinces. ‘ Oh, Nikolay Vsevolodovich,’ he exclaimed, ‘what troubled me most of all was that this was completely against all civil laws, and primarily those of the fatherland! Suddenly they would print that people should go out with pitchforks, and remember that he who went out poor in the morning could return home rich in the evening. Just think of it, sir! I was shaking in my boots, but I was distributing them. Or suddenly there would be five or six lines addressed to all of Russia, for no good reason: “Lock the churches as soon as you can, destroy God, violate marriages, destroy the rights of inheritance, take up knives”, that’s all, and the Devil knows what else. That was the piece of paper, with the five lines, that I was almost caught with, but the officers of the regiment gave me a good beating and then, God bless them, let me go. And then I was almost arrested last year when I passed some counterfeit fifty-rouble French notes to Korovayev. Well, thank God, Korovayev went and drowned in a pond when he was drunk, and they didn’t succeed in exposing me. Here, at Virginsky’s, I was proclaiming the freedom of the socialist wife. In June I was in —sky District again, distributing leaflets. They say they’ll make me do it again.

He told how, while still in Petersburg, he ""firstly got carried away just out of friendship, like a loyal student, though not being a student,"" and, knowing nothing, ""guilty of nothing,"" was spreading various papers in stairways, leaving them by the dozens in doorways, behind bellpulls, sticking them in instead of newspapers, bringing them to theaters, tucking them into hats, slipping them into pockets. And later he had started taking money from them, ""for my means, just think of my means, sir!"" He had spread ""all sorts of rubbish"" over the districts of two provinces. "" Oh, Nikolai Vsevolodovich,"" he went on exclaiming, "" what made me most indignant was its being completely against all civic and predominantly fatherland laws! It would suddenly be printed to go out with pitchforks, and remember that he who goes out poor in the morning may come home rich in the evening-just think, sir! I myself used to get the shudders, but I kept spreading them around. Or else suddenly, five or six lines, to the whole of Russia, out of the blue: 'Quick, lock the churches, destroy God, break up marriages, destroy the rights of inheritance, grab your knives'-that's all, and God knows what next. It was with that piece, the one with the five lines, sir, that I almost got caught; the officers of the regiment gave me a beating, but, God bless them, they let me go. And then last year they almost got me when I gave French counterfeit fifty-rouble bills to Korovaev; but, thank God, just then Korovaev drowned in the pond while drunk, and they didn't have time to expose me. Here at Virginsky's I proclaimed the freedom of the social wife. In June I again did some spreading around the ----- district. They say they'll make me do more of it...

Но удивительно нам было то: через кого это всё могло так скоро и точно выйти наружу? Ни одно из присутствовавших тогда лиц не имело бы, кажется, ни нужды, ни выгоды нарушить секрет происшедшего. Прислуги тогда не было; один Лебядкин мог бы что-нибудь разболтать, не столько по злобе, потому что вышел тогда в крайнем испуге (а страх к врагу уничтожает и злобу к нему), а единственно по невоздержанности. Но Лебядкин, вместе с сестрицей, на другой же день пропал без вести; в доме Филиппова его не оказалось, он переехал неизвестно куда и точно сгинул. Шатов, у которого я хотел было справиться о Марье Тимофеевне, заперся и, кажется, все эти восемь дней просидел у себя на квартире, даже прервав свои занятия в городе. Меня он не принял. Я было зашел к нему во вторник и стукнул в дверь. Ответа не получил, но уверенный, по несомненным данным, что он дома, постучался в другой раз. Тогда он, соскочив, по-видимому, с постели, подошел крупными шагами к дверям и крикнул мне во весь голос: «Шатова дома нет». Я с тем и ушел.","Needless to say, the most diverse rumors went around the city, that is, about the slap in the face, the fainting of Lizaveta Nikolaevna, and other things that happened that Sunday.

None of the persons present at that time would seem to have had either the need or the advantage to violate the secret of what had happened. There were no servants then; Lebyadkin alone could blurt something out, not so much out of malice, because then he went out in extreme fright (and fear of the enemy destroys anger towards him), but solely out of intemperance. But Lebyadkin, along with his sister, went missing the very next day; he was not in Filippov's house, he moved to no one knows where and disappeared for sure.

"Помню, в первом часу пополудни я зашел тогда на площадь; толпа была молчалива и лица важно-угрюмые. Подъехал на дрожках купец, жирный и желтый, вылез из экипажа, отдал земной поклон, приложился, пожертвовал рубль, охая взобрался на дрожки и опять уехал. Подъехала и коляска с двумя нашими дамами в сопровождении двух наших шалунов. Молодые люди (из коих один был уже не совсем молодой) вышли тоже из экипажа и протеснились к иконе, довольно небрежно отстраняя народ. Оба шляп не скинули, а один надвинул на нос пенсне. В народе зароптали, правда глухо, но неприветливо. Молодец в пенсне вынул из портмоне, туго набитого кредитками, медную копейку и бросил на блюдо; оба, смеясь и громко говоря, повернулись к коляске. В эту минуту вдруг подскакала, в сопровождении Маврикия Николаевича, Лизавета Николаевна. Она соскочила с лошади, бросила повод своему спутнику, оставшемуся по ее приказанию на коне, и подошла к образу именно в то время, когда брошена была копейка. Румянец негодования залил ее щеки; она сняла свою круглую шляпу, перчатки, упала на колени пред образом, прямо на грязный тротуар, и благоговейно положила три земных поклона. Затем вынула свой портмоне, но так как в нем оказалось только несколько гривенников, то мигом сняла свои бриллиантовые серьги и положила на блюдо.","I remember that at one o'clock in the afternoon I went into the square then; the crowd was silent and the faces solemnly gloomy. A merchant, fat and yellow, rode up in a droshky, got out of the carriage, bowed to the ground, kissed, donated a ruble, groaned, climbed into the droshky and left again. A carriage also drove up with our two ladies, accompanied by our two naughty ones. Young people (one of whom was no longer quite young) also got out of the carriage and made their way to the icon, rather carelessly pushing the people away. Both hats were not thrown off, but one pulled pince-nez over his nose. The people murmured, though muffled, but unfriendly. A fine fellow in pince-nez took out a copper kopeck from a purse stuffed tightly with banknotes and threw it on a dish; both, laughing and speaking loudly, turned towards the carriage. At that moment Lizaveta Nikolaevna suddenly galloped up, accompanied by Mavriky Nikolaevich. She jumped off her horse, threw the bridle to her companion, who, at her command, remained on horseback, and approached the icon just at the time when the penny was thrown. A blush of indignation flooded her cheeks; she took off her round hat and gloves, fell on her knees in front of the icon, right on the dirty pavement, and reverently made three bows to the earth. Then she took out her purse, but since it contained only a few kopecks, she immediately took off her diamond earrings and put them on a dish.","I remember going into the marketplace after twelve o’clock in the afternoon.

A carriage also drove up with two of our ladies accompanied by two of our pranksters. The young men (of whom one was no longer so very young) also stepped out of their vehicle and elbowed their way to the icon, shoving people aside rather unceremoniously. Neither removed his hat, and one perched a pince-nez on his nose. The public began to murmur, indistinctly to be sure, but in an unfriendly way. The young dandy with the pince-nez removed a copper coin from his wallet, which was chock full of banknotes, and threw it on to the plate; both, laughing and talking loudly, turned back to the carriage. At that moment Lizaveta Nikolayevna galloped up, accompanied by Mavriky Nikolayevich. She jumped off her horse, tossed the reins to her companion, who remained on his horse, as she had ordered, and went up to the icon at precisely the moment the kopeck had been tossed. Her cheeks flushed with indignation. She removed her round hat and her gloves, fell on her knees in front of the icon, straight on to the dirty pavement and made three reverential deep bows. Then she took out her purse, but since there proved to be only a few ten-kopeck pieces in it, she instantly removed her diamond earrings and laid them on the plate.","I remember stopping in the square then, at one o'clock in the afternoon; the crowd was silent, the faces significantly somber.

"Трудно было бы представить более жалкую, более пошлую, более бездарную и пресную аллегорию, как эта «кадриль литературы». Ничего нельзя было придумать менее подходящего к нашей публике; а между тем придумывал ее, говорят, Кармазинов. Правда, устраивал Липутин, советуясь с тем самым хромым учителем, который был на вечере у Виргинского. Но Кармазинов все-таки давал идею и даже сам, говорят, хотел нарядиться и взять какую-то особую и самостоятельную роль. Кадриль состояла из шести пар жалких масок, – даже почти и не масок, потому что они были в таких же платьях, как и все. Так, например, один пожилой господин, невысокого роста, во фраке, – одним словом, так, как все одеваются, – с почтенною седою бородой (подвязанною, и в этом состоял весь костюм), танцуя, толокся на одном месте с солидным выражением в лице, часто и мелко семеня ногами и почти не сдвигаясь с места. Он издавал какие-то звуки умеренным, но охрипшим баском, и вот эта-то охриплость голоса и должна была означать одну из известных газет. Напротив этой маски танцевали два какие-то гиганта X и Z, и эти буквы были у них пришпилены на фраках, но что означали эти X и Z, так и осталось неразъясненным. «Честная русская мысль» изображалась в виде господина средних лет, в очках, во фраке, в перчатках и – в кандалах (в настоящих кандалах). Под мышкой этой мысли был портфель с каким-то «делом». Из кармана выглядывало распечатанное письмо из-за границы, заключавшее в себе удостоверение, для всех сомневающихся, в честности «честной русской мысли». Всё это досказывалось распорядителями уже изустно, потому что торчавшее из кармана письмо нельзя же было прочесть. В приподнятой правой руке «честная русская мысль» держала бокал, как будто желая провозгласить тост. По обе стороны ее и с нею рядом семенили две стриженые нигилистки, a vis-à-vis[213] танцевал какой-то тоже пожилой господин, во фраке, но с тяжелою дубиной в руке и будто бы изображал собою непетербургское, но грозное издание: «Прихлопну – мокренько будет». Но, несмотря на свою дубину, он никак не мог снести пристально устремленных на него очков «честной русской мысли» и старался глядеть по сторонам, а когда делал pas de deux,[214] то изгибался, вертелся и не знал, куда деваться, – до того, вероятно, мучила его совесть… Впрочем, не упомню всех этих тупеньких выдумок; всё было в таком же роде, так что, наконец, мне стало мучительно стыдно. И вот именно то же самое впечатление как бы стыда отразилось и на всей публике, даже на самых угрюмых физиономиях, явившихся из буфета. Некоторое время все молчали и смотрели в сердитом недоумении. Человек в стыде обыкновенно начинает сердиться и наклонен к цинизму. Мало-помалу загудела наша публика:","It would be difficult to imagine a more pitiful, more vulgar, more incompetent and insipid allegory than this ""quadrille of literature"". Nothing could have been less suitable for our public; meanwhile, Karmazinov, they say, invented it. True, Liputin arranged it, consulting with the same lame teacher who was at the party at Virginsky's. But Karmazinov still gave the idea and even himself, they say, wanted to dress up and take on some special and independent role. The quadrille consisted of six miserable pairs of masks - almost no masks at all, because they were in the same dresses as everyone else. So, for example, one elderly gentleman, short in stature, in a tailcoat - in a word, the way everyone dresses - with a respectable gray beard (tied up, and this was the whole costume), dancing, huddled in one place with a respectable expression in face, often and finely seeding with their feet and almost without moving from their place. He made some sounds in a moderate but hoarse bass voice, and it was this hoarseness of voice that should have meant one of the famous newspapers. Opposite this mask, two giants X and Z were dancing, and these letters were pinned on their tailcoats, but what these X and Z meant remained unclear. ""Honest Russian Thought"" was portrayed as a middle-aged gentleman, wearing glasses, a tailcoat, gloves and - in shackles (in real shackles). Under the arm of this thought was a briefcase with some kind of “case”. A printed letter from abroad looked out of his pocket, containing a certificate, for all those who doubted, of the honesty of ""honest Russian thought."" All this was said by the stewards orally, because the letter sticking out of the pocket could not be read. In her raised right hand, the ""honest Russian thought"" held a glass, as if wanting to proclaim a toast. On either side of her and next to her, two short-haired nihilists were scurrying about, and vis-à-vis [213] some elderly gentleman, also in a tailcoat, but with a heavy club in his hand, was dancing, as if he represented a non-Petersburg, but formidable publication: ""I'll slap it - it will be wet."" But, in spite of his cudgel, he could not bear the glasses of ""honest Russian thought"" fixed on him intently, and tried to look around, and when he did pas de deux,[214] he bent, spun and did not know where to go - his conscience probably tormented him to such an extent... However, I will not remember all these stupid inventions; everything was in the same way, so that, finally, I became painfully ashamed. And precisely the same impression, as it were, of shame was reflected on the whole audience, even on the most gloomy faces that appeared from the buffet. For some time everyone was silent and looked in angry bewilderment. A person in shame usually becomes angry and inclined towards cynicism. Little by little, our audience buzzed:","It would have been difficult to imagine a more pitiful, more tasteless, more talentless and vapid allegory than this ‘literary quadrille’.

To be sure, Liputin arranged it, in consultation with that same lame teacher who had been at the Virginskys’ evening meeting. Nonetheless, Karmazinov had come up with the idea and, they say, even wanted to dress himself up and take some special solo part in it. The quadrille consisted of six pathetic pairs of maskers — really not even maskers, because they were wearing the same kinds of clothes as everyone else. So, for instance, an elderly gentleman, short and in a tail-coat — in fact, dressed the same as everyone else — and with a respectable grey beard that had been tied on (this constituted his entire costume), was trotting away in place as he danced, a stolid expression on his face, taking tiny and rapid steps in one and the same spot. He was making some sounds in a subdued but hoarse bass, and it was this hoarseness of voice that was supposed to represent one of the well-known newspapers. Opposite this masker two giant X and Z were dancing, and these letters had been pinned on their tail-coats, but what the X and Z stood for remained unspecified. ‘ Honest Russian thought’ was represented in the form of a middle-aged gentleman wearing spectacles, a tail-coat, gloves and — fetters (real fetters). Tucked under this idea’s arm was a portfolio with some ‘case’ in it. Peeping out of one pocket was an unsealed letter from abroad, which contained a certificate attesting, for the benefit of all doubters, to the honesty of ‘honest Russian thought’. All of this was spelled out verbally by the stewards, since the letter sticking out of the pocket could certainly not have been read. In his raised right hand ‘honest Russian thought’ was holding a glass, as if he wished to propose a toast. On either side of him two close-cropped nihilist girls danced in mincing steps, and vis-a-vis danced another elderly gentleman, in a tail-coat, but with a heavy cudgel in his hand, apparently representing a formidable publication, although not from Petersburg, entitled ‘One Bash — You’re Just Hash’. But despite his cudgel, he simply couldn’t endure the spectacles of ‘honest Russian thought’ that were trained on him, and he was trying to look away, and when he was doing a pas de deux, he twisted and turned and didn’t know where to go, so much did his conscience pain him, apparently. However, I won’t mention any more of these stupid little contrivances; everything was in the same vein, so that I finally became painfully ashamed. And then this very same expression of what seemed like shame was reflected on the faces of the entire public, even the most gloomy ones that had appeared from the buffet. For some time everyone remained silent and looked on in angry bewilderment. A man who is ashamed usually begins to grow angry and is inclined to cynicism.

"Поспешу заметить здесь, по возможности вкратце, что Варвара Петровна хотя и стала в последние годы излишне, как говорили, расчетлива и даже скупенька, но иногда не жалела денег собственно на благотворительность. Она состояла членом одного благотворительного общества в столице. В недавний голодный год она отослала в Петербург, в главный комитет для приема пособий потерпевшим, пятьсот рублей, и об этом у нас говорили. Наконец, в самое последнее время, пред назначением нового губернатора, она было совсем уже основала местный дамский комитет для пособия самым беднейшим родильницам в городе и в губернии. У нас сильно упрекали ее в честолюбии; но известная стремительность характера Варвары Петровны и в то же время настойчивость чуть не восторжествовали над препятствиями; общество почти уже устроилось, а первоначальная мысль всё шире и шире развивалась в восхищенном уме основательницы: она уже мечтала об основании такого же комитета в Москве, о постепенном распространении его действий по всем губерниям. И вот, с внезапною переменой губернатора, всё приостановилось; а новая губернаторша, говорят, уже успела высказать в обществе несколько колких и, главное, метких и дельных возражений насчет будто бы непрактичности основной мысли подобного комитета, что, разумеется с прикрасами, было уже передано Варваре Петровне. Один бог знает глубину сердец, но полагаю, что Варвара Петровна даже с некоторым удовольствием приостановилась теперь в самых соборных вратах, зная, что мимо должна сейчас же пройти губернаторша, а затем и все, и «пусть сама увидит, как мне всё равно, что бы она там ни подумала и что бы ни сострила еще насчет тщеславия моей благотворительности. Вот же вам всем!»","I hasten to note here, as briefly as possible, that Varvara Petrovna, although in recent years she has become unnecessarily prudent, as they say, and even stingy, sometimes she did not spare money for her own charity. She was a member of a charitable society in the capital. In the recent year of famine, she sent five hundred rubles to the main committee for receiving allowances for the victims in St. Petersburg, and we talked about this. Finally, very recently, before the appointment of a new governor, she had already completely founded a local ladies' committee to provide assistance to the poorest women in childbirth in the city and in the province. We strongly reproached her for ambition; but the well-known swiftness of Varvara Petrovna's character and at the same time perseverance almost triumphed over obstacles; society was almost settled, and the original idea was developing more and more widely in the admiring mind of the founder: she already dreamed of founding a similar committee in Moscow, of gradually spreading its activities throughout all the provinces. And so, with the sudden change of governor, everything stopped; and the new governor's wife, they say, has already managed to express in society a few sharp and, most importantly, well-aimed and sensible objections about the supposed impracticality of the main idea of such a committee, which, of course, with embellishments, has already been conveyed to Varvara Petrovna. God alone knows the depth of hearts, but I believe that Varvara Petrovna, even with some pleasure, now paused at the very cathedral gates, knowing that the governor’s wife should immediately pass by, and then everything else, and “let her see for herself how it doesn’t matter to me what no matter what she thinks there and no matter what she jokes about the vanity of my charity.

In the recent year of famine13 she had sent to Petersburg, to the main committee for the relief of sufferers, five hundred roubles, and this was talked about in our town. Finally, and most recently, just before the appointment of the new governor, she had been on the point of founding a women’s committee for aid to the very poorest of new mothers in the town and province. Among us she was heartily reproached for being ambitious; but the well-known impetuosity of Varvara Petrovna’s character, combined with her fixity of purpose, almost always triumphed over obstacles.

Only God knows the depths of human hearts, but I imagine that it was with a certain pleasure that Varvara Petrovna now paused at the very doors of the cathedral, knowing that the governor’s wife must pass by at any moment now, followed by everyone else, and ‘then let her see for herself how little I care what she may think, and what other sarcastic remarks she might make concerning the vanity of my charitable works.

In a recent famine year she had sent five hundred roubles to Petersburg, to the main committee for the receipt of aid for the victims, and this was talked about in town. Finally, quite recently, before the appointment of the new governor, she had all but established a local ladies' committee to aid the poorest new mothers in our town and in the province. She was severely reproached among us for being ambitious; but the notorious impetuousness of Varvara Petrovna's character, together with her persistence, nearly triumphed over the obstacles; the society was almost set up, and the initial idea broadened more and more in the delighted mind of the foundress: she was already dreaming of establishing a similar committee in Moscow, of gradually expanding its activities through all the provinces.

Заметьте, что в качестве реалиста он не может солгать и что истина ему дороже успеха… разумеется, кроме тех особенных случаев, когда успех дороже истины. (Говоря это, он всё осматривался). Таким образом, вы видите ясно, maman, что не вам у меня прощения просить и что если есть тут где-нибудь сумасшествие, то, конечно, прежде всего с моей стороны, и, значит, в конце концов я все-таки помешанный, – надо же поддержать свою здешнюю репутацию…","- Knightly?

"Пожар испугал нашу заречную публику именно тем, что поджог был очевидный. Замечательно, что при первом крике «горим» сейчас же раздался и крик, что «поджигают шпигулинские». Теперь уже слишком хорошо известно, что и в самом деле трое шпигулинских участвовали в поджоге, но – и только; все остальные с фабрики совершенно оправданы и общим мнением и официально. Кроме тех трех негодяев (из коих один пойман и сознался, а двое по сю пору в бегах), несомненно участвовал в поджоге и Федька Каторжный.

"Во-первых, к обедне собрался почти весь город, то есть разумея высший слой нашего общества. Знали, что пожалует губернаторша, в первый раз после своего к нам прибытия. Замечу, что у нас уже пошли слухи о том, что она вольнодумна и «новых правил». Всем дамам известно было тоже, что она великолепно и с необыкновенным изяществом будет одета; а потому наряды наших дам отличались на этот раз изысканностью и пышностью. Одна лишь Варвара Петровна была скромно и по-всегдашнему одета во всё черное; так бессменно одевалась она в продолжение последних четырех лет. Прибыв в собор, она поместилась на обычном своем месте, налево, в первом ряду, и ливрейный лакей положил пред нею бархатную подушку для коленопреклонений, одним словом, всё по-обыкновенному. Но заметили тоже, что на этот раз она во всё продолжение службы как-то чрезвычайно усердно молилась; уверяли даже потом, когда всё припомнили, что даже слезы стояли в глазах ее. Кончилась наконец обедня, и наш протоиерей, отец Павел, вышел сказать торжественную проповедь. У нас любили его проповеди и ценили их высоко; уговаривали его даже напечатать, но он всё не решался.

А между тем в этой собравшейся кучке граждан, под видом празднования именин, уже находились некоторые, которым были сделаны и определенные предложения. Петр Верховенский успел слепить у нас «пятерку», наподобие той, которая уже была у него заведена в Москве и еще, как оказалось теперь, в нашем уезде между офицерами. Говорят, тоже была одна у него и в X—ской губернии. Эти пятеро избранных сидели теперь за общим столом и весьма искусно умели придать себе вид самых обыкновенных людей, так что никто их не мог узнать. То были, – так как теперь это не тайна, – во-первых, Липутин, затем сам Виргинский, длинноухий Шигалев – брат госпожи Виргинской, Лямшин и, наконец, некто Толкаченко – странная личность, человек уже лет сорока и славившийся огромным изучением народа, преимущественно мошенников и разбойников, ходивший нарочно по кабакам (впрочем, не для одного изучения народного) и щеголявший между нами дурным платьем, смазными сапогами, прищуренно-хитрым видом и народными фразами с завитком. Раз или два еще прежде Лямшин приводил его к Степану Трофимовичу на вечера, где, впрочем, он особенного эффекта не произвел. В городе появлялся он временами, преимущественно когда бывал без места, а служил по железным дорогам. Все эти пятеро деятелей составили свою первую кучку с теплою верой, что она лишь единица между сотнями и тысячами таких же пятерок, как и ихняя, разбросанных по России, и что все зависят от какого-то центрального, огромного, но тайного места, которое в свою очередь связано органически с европейскою всемирною революцией. Но, к сожалению, я должен признаться, что между ними даже и в то уже время начал обнаруживаться разлад. Дело в том, что они хоть и ждали еще с весны Петра Верховенского, возвещенного им сперва Толкаченкой, а потом приехавшим Шигалевым, хоть и ждали от него чрезвычайных чудес и хоть и пошли тотчас же все, без малейшей критики и по первому его зову, в кружок, но только что составили пятерку, все как бы тотчас же и обиделись, и именно, я полагаю, за быстроту своего согласия. Пошли они, разумеется, из великодушного стыда, чтобы не сказали потом, что они не посмели пойти; но все-таки Петр Верховенский должен бы был оценить их благородный подвиг и по крайней мере рассказать им в награждение какой-нибудь самый главный анекдот. Но Верховенский вовсе не хотел удовлетворить их законного любопытства и лишнего ничего не рассказывал; вообще третировал их с замечательною строгостью и даже небрежностью. Это решительно раздражило, и член Шигалев уже подбивал остальных «потребовать отчета», но, разумеется, не теперь у Виргинского, где собралось столько посторонних.","I think that all these gentlemen really gathered at that time in the pleasant hope of hearing something particularly interesting, and they gathered in advance. They were the color of the brightest red liberalism in our ancient city, and were very carefully selected by Virginsky for this ""meeting."" I will also note that some of them (however, very few) had not visited him at all before. Of course, most of the guests had no clear idea why they were being warned. True, they all then took Pyotr Stepanovich for an emissary who had arrived from abroad and had authority; this idea somehow immediately took root and, naturally, flattered. Meanwhile, in this gathered group of citizens, under the guise of celebrating a name day, there were already some who were made certain proposals. Pyotr Verkhovensky managed to make a ""five"" with us, similar to the one that he already had in Moscow and, as it turned out now, in our district among the officers. They say he also had one in the 10th province. These five chosen ones were now sitting at a common table and were very skillfully able to give themselves the appearance of the most ordinary people, so that no one could recognize them. They were, since now it is not a secret, firstly, Liputin, then Virginsky himself, the long-eared Shigalev - the brother of Mrs. Virginskaya, Lyamshin and, finally, a certain Tolkachenko - a strange person, a man of forty years old and famous for his great study of the people, mostly swindlers and robbers, who purposely went around the taverns (however, not just for the study of the folk) and flaunted among us a bad dress, oily boots, a screwed up sly look and folk phrases with a curl. Once or twice before, Lyamshin had brought him to Stepan Trofimovich's for evenings, where, however, he had no particular effect. He appeared in the city from time to time, mainly when he was without a job, but served on the railways. All these five figures made up their first group with a warm belief that it was only a unit among hundreds and thousands of the same fives, like theirs, scattered throughout Russia, and that everything depended on some central, huge, but secret place, which in is, in turn, organically connected with the European world revolution. But, unfortunately, I must confess that between them, even at that time, a discord began to appear. The fact is that even though they had been waiting since the spring for Peter Verkhovensky, heralded by him first by Tolkachenko, and then by the arrival of Shigalev, even though they expected extraordinary miracles from him, and even though they all immediately went, without the slightest criticism and at his first call, to circle, but as soon as they made a five, everyone immediately seemed to be offended, and precisely, I believe, for the speed of their agreement. They went, of course, out of generous shame, so that they would not say later that they did not dare to go; but all the same, Pyotr Verkhovensky should have appreciated their noble deed and at least told them some most important anecdote as a reward. But Verkhovensky did not at all want to satisfy their legitimate curiosity and did not say anything superfluous; generally treated them with remarkable severity and even negligence. This irritated me decisively, and member Shigalev was already inciting the others to ""demand an account,"" but, of course, not now at Virginsky, where so many strangers had gathered.","I think that all these ladies and gentlemen had really gathered on that occasion in the pleasant hope of hearing something especially curious, and that they had gathered forewarned. They represented the flower of the brightest red liberalism in our ancient town, and had been very carefully chosen by Virginsky for this ‘meeting’. I will also note that some of them (very few, however) had never visited him before now. Of course, the majority of the guests had no clear notion of why they had been forewarned. True, all of them on this occasion took Pyotr Stepanovich for an emissary from abroad who had plenipotentiary powers; this idea had immediately taken root somehow and was naturally very flattering. Meanwhile, in this assembled band of citizens, under the guise of a name-day celebration, there were some to whom definite proposals had already been made. Pyotr Stepanovich had succeeded in fashioning a ‘group of five’ along the lines of the one that had already been established by him in Moscow, and already, as it now turned out, among some army officers in our district. I am told that he also had one in Kh— sk Province as well. This group of five chosen ones was sitting at the common table and had very skilfully succeeded in giving itself the appearance of very ordinary people, so much so that no one could recognize them. They were — inasmuch as this is not a secret now — first of all Liputin, then Virginsky himself, the long-eared Shigalyov (Mrs Virginskaya’s brother), Lyamshin and finally, a certain Tolkachenko — a strange individual, a man who was already about forty and was famous for his enormous knowledge of the common people, mainly crooks and thieves, who made a point of frequenting pot-houses (not, however, just to study the people), and who, in our circle, flaunted his bad clothes, his tarred boots, his squinty and cunning eyes, and the folk expressions that he delivered with a flourish. Once or twice before, Lyamshin had brought him to soirées at Stepan Trofimovich ’s, where, however, he produced no particular impression. He would appear in town from time to time, mainly when he had no job, and he used to work on the railways. Every one of these five operatives formed the first group in the fervent belief that it was merely a unit that linked hundreds and thousands of similar groups of five, just like theirs, scattered throughout Russia, and that everything depended on some huge but secret central organization that, in turn, was organically linked with the universal European revolution. But to my regret, I must admit that even at that time there were signs of discord among them. The thing was that although they had been waiting ever since spring for Pyotr Stepanovich’s arrival, which had been announced to them first by Tolkachenko and then by Shigalyov, who had just come to town, and although they expected extraordinary miracles from him, and although all of them had immediately entered the circle, without the slightest criticism and at his very first summons, still, no sooner had they formed the group of five than all of them seemed immediately to take offence, precisely, I suppose, because they had agreed so quickly. They had joined, of course, out of a high-minded sense of shame, so that people couldn’t say later that they didn’t dare join; still and all, Pyotr Verkhovensky should have appreciated their noble deed and at least rewarded them by telling them some really important piece of news. But Verkhovensky had absolutely no desire to satisfy their legitimate curiosity and never told them anything they didn’t need to know. In general, he treated them with remarkable severity and even offhandedness. This proved distinctly irritating, and Member Shigalyov was already egging the others on to ‘demand an accounting’, but of course not on this occasion at Virginsky’s, where so many outsiders had gathered.","I believe that all these gentlemen had indeed gathered then in the pleasant hope of hearing something especially curious, and had been so informed before they gathered.

And yet in this bunch of citizens gathered under the pretense of a name-day celebration, there were some to whom certain proposals had already been made. Pyotr Verkhovensky had managed to slap up a ""fivesome"" in our town, similar to the one he already had going in Moscow and also, as it now turns out, among the officers in our district. They say he had one in Kh-- province as well. These five elect were now sitting at the general table and managed to feign quite skillfully the look of the most ordinary people, so that no one could recognize them. These were-since it is no longer a secret-first, Liputin, then Virginsky himself, long-eared Shigalyov (Mrs. Virginsky's brother), Lyamshin, and, finally, a certain Tolkachenko-a strange character, already a man of forty, and famous for his vast study of the people, predominantly crooks and robbers, for which purpose he frequented the pot-houses (not only to study the people, however), and who flaunted among us his bad clothing, tarred boots, squintingly sly look, and frilly folk expressions.

But, unfortunately, I must confess that even then there had begun to be discord among them.

They had joined, of course, out of a magnanimous sense of shame, so that no one could say later that they had not dared to join; but, still, Pyotr Verkhovensky ought really to have appreciated their noble deed and at least have told them some foremost anecdote as a reward.

"По поводу посторонних у меня тоже есть одна мысль, что вышеозначенные члены первой пятерки наклонны были подозревать в этот вечер в числе гостей Виргинского еще членов каких-нибудь им неизвестных групп, тоже заведенных в городе, по той же тайной организации и тем же самым Верховенским, так что в конце концов все собравшиеся подозревали друг друга и один пред другим принимали разные осанки, что и придавало всему собранию весьма сбивчивый и даже отчасти романический вид. Впрочем, тут были люди и вне всякого подозрения. Так, например, один служащий майор, близкий родственник Виргинского, совершенно невинный человек, которого и не приглашали, но который сам пришел к имениннику, так что никак нельзя было его не принять. Но именинник все-таки был спокоен, потому что майор «никак не мог донести»; ибо, несмотря на всю свою глупость, всю жизнь любил сновать по всем местам, где водятся крайние либералы; сам не сочувствовал, но послушать очень любил. Мало того, был даже компрометирован: случилось так, что чрез его руки, в молодости, прошли целые склады «Колокола» и прокламаций, и хоть он их даже развернуть боялся, но отказаться распространять их почел бы за совершенную подлость – и таковы иные русские люди даже и до сего дня. Остальные гости или представляли собою тип придавленного до желчи благородного самолюбия, или тип первого благороднейшего порыва пылкой молодости. То были два или три учителя, из которых один хромой, лет уже сорока пяти, преподаватель в гимназии, очень ядовитый и замечательно тщеславный человек, и два или три офицера. Из последних один очень молодой артиллерист, всего только на днях приехавший из одного учебного военного заведения, мальчик молчаливый и еще не успевший составить знакомства, вдруг очутился теперь у Виргинского с карандашом в руках и, почти не участвуя в разговоре, поминутно отмечал что-то в своей записной книжке. Все это видели, но все почему-то старались делать вид, что не примечают. Был еще тут праздношатающийся семинарист, который с Лямшиным подсунул книгоноше мерзостные фотографии, крупный парень с развязною, но в то же время недоверчивою манерой, с бессменно обличительною улыбкой, а вместе с тем и со спокойным видом торжествующего совершенства, заключенного в нем самом. Был, не знаю для чего, и сын нашего городского головы, тот самый скверный мальчишка, истаскавшийся не по летам и о котором я уже упоминал, рассказывая историю маленькой поручицы. Этот весь вечер молчал. И, наконец, в заключение, один гимназист, очень горячий и взъерошенный мальчик лет восемнадцати, сидевший с мрачным видом оскорбленного в своем достоинстве молодого человека и видимо страдая за свои восемнадцать лет. Этот крошка был уже начальником самостоятельной кучки заговорщиков, образовавшейся в высшем классе гимназии, что и обнаружилось, ко всеобщему удивлению, впоследствии. Я не упомянул о Шатове: он расположился тут же в заднем углу стола, несколько выдвинув из ряду свой стул, смотрел в землю, мрачно молчал, от чаю и хлеба отказался и всё время не выпускал из рук свой картуз, как бы желая тем заявить, что он не гость, а пришел по делу, и когда захочет, встанет и уйдет. Недалеко от него поместился и Кириллов, тоже очень молчаливый, но в землю не смотрел, а, напротив, в упор рассматривал каждого говорившего своим неподвижным взглядом без блеску и выслушивал всё без малейшего волнения или удивления. Некоторые из гостей, никогда не видавшие его прежде, разглядывали его задумчиво и украдкой. Неизвестно, знала ли что-нибудь сама madame Виргинская о существовавшей пятерке? Полагаю, что знала всё, и именно от супруга. Студентка же, конечно, ни в чем не участвовала, но у ней была своя забота; она намеревалась прогостить всего только день или два, а затем отправиться дальше и дальше, по всем университетским городам, чтобы «принять участие в страданиях бедных студентов и возбудить их к протесту». Она везла с собою несколько сот экземпляров литографированного воззвания и, кажется, собственного сочинения. Замечательно, что гимназист возненавидел ее с первого взгляда почти до кровомщения, хотя и видел ее в первый раз в жизни, а она равномерно его. Майор приходился ей родным дядей и встретил ее сегодня в первый раз после десяти лет. Когда вошли Ставрогин и Верховенский, щеки ее были красны, как клюква: она только что разбранилась с дядей за убеждения по женскому вопросу.","As for strangers, I also have one thought, that the above-mentioned members of the first five were inclined to suspect among the guests of Virginsky that evening members of some unknown groups, also established in the city, by the same secret organization and by the same Verkhovensky, so that in the end all the assembled suspected each other and, one before the other, adopted different postures, which gave the whole assembly a very confused and even somewhat romantic look. However, there were people here beyond any suspicion. So, for example, one serving major, a close relative of Virginsky, a completely innocent person who was not invited, but who himself came to the birthday man, so it was impossible not to accept him. But the birthday boy was still calm, because the major ""couldn't get across""; for, despite all his stupidity, all his life he liked to scurry about all the places where extreme liberals are found; I didn't sympathize myself, but I liked to listen very much. Not only that, he was even compromised: it so happened that through his hands, in his youth, entire warehouses of Kolokol and proclamations passed, and although he was even afraid to unfold them, he would consider refusing to distribute them as a complete meanness - and such are other Russian people even to this day. The rest of the guests either represented a type of noble self-esteem crushed to bile, or a type of the first noble impulse of ardent youth. They were two or three teachers, one of whom was lame, already forty-five years old, a teacher at the gymnasium, a very venomous and remarkably vain person, and two or three officers. Of the latter, one very young artilleryman, who had only recently arrived from a certain military educational institution, a silent boy and who had not yet had time to make acquaintances, suddenly found himself now at Virginsky with a pencil in his hands and, almost without participating in the conversation, constantly noted something in your notebook. Everyone saw it, but for some reason everyone tried to pretend not to notice. There was also a loitering seminarian who, with Lyamshin, slipped vile photographs on the bookseller, a big guy with a cheeky, but at the same time incredulous manner, with a permanently accusatory smile, and at the same time with a calm air of triumphant perfection contained in himself. There was, I don’t know why, also the son of our mayor, that same nasty boy, worn out beyond his years and whom I already mentioned when telling the story of a little lieutenant. This whole evening was silent. And, finally, in conclusion, one high school student, a very hot and disheveled boy of about eighteen, who sat with a gloomy look of a young man insulted in his dignity and apparently suffering for his eighteen years. This little one was already the head of an independent group of conspirators that had formed in the upper class of the gymnasium, which, to everyone's surprise, was later revealed. I didn’t mention Shatov: he sat right there in the back corner of the table, pulling his chair out of the row a little, looked at the ground, was gloomy silent, refused tea and bread, and all the time did not let go of his cap, as if wanting to thereby declare, that he is not a guest, but has come on business, and when he wants, he will get up and leave. Not far from him was Kirillov, also very silent, but he did not look at the ground, but, on the contrary, he examined everyone who spoke point-blank with his motionless gaze without glare and listened to everything without the slightest agitation or surprise. Some of the guests, who had never seen him before, looked at him thoughtfully and furtively. It is not known whether Madame Virginskaya herself knew anything about the existing five? I believe that she knew everything, and it was from her husband. The student, of course, did not participate in anything, but she had her own concern; she intended to stay only a day or two, and then go on and on, to all the university cities, in order to ""take part in the suffering of poor students and excite them to protest."" She was carrying with her several hundred copies of a lithographed appeal and, it seems, of her own composition. It is remarkable that the schoolboy hated her at first sight, almost to the point of vengeance, although he saw her for the first time in his life, and she evenly saw him. The major was her own uncle and met her today for the first time in ten years. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky entered, her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just quarreled with her uncle for her convictions on the women's question.","With regard to the outsiders, I also have an idea that the members of the first group of five enumerated above were inclined to suspect the presence among Virginsky’s guests that evening of members of some other groups unknown to them that had also been established in the town, along the same secret organizational lines and by the very same Verkhovensky; the result being that in the final analysis, all those assembled suspected one another, and struck various poses before one another, which gave the entire gathering a very confused and even partly romantic look. However, there were people here who were certainly above all suspicion. Such, for instance, was a certain major on active service, a close relative of Virginsky ’s , a completely innocent man to whom they hadn’t extended an invitation, but who showed up on his own to greet the name-day celebrant, so there was no way he couldn’t be received. But the name-day celebrant was nonetheless unperturbed, inasmuch as ‘there was no way the major could inform on them’, because, for all his stupidity, all his life he had enjoyed scampering about all the places where radical liberals abounded. He himself was not sympathetic, but he was very fond of listening to them. In addition, he had even been compromised. It so happened that in his youth whole reams of manifestos and of the Bell had passed through his hands, and even though he was afraid even to open them, he would have considered it absolutely dastardly to refuse to distribute them — and that’s the way some Russian people are to this very day. The remaining guests represented two types: noble pride that had been crushed to the point of bitterness, or the first and noblest impulse of ardent youth. There were two or three teachers present, one of whom was a lame man of about forty-five, an instructor in a secondary school, a very venomous and conspicuously vain man, and two or three army officers. Of the latter, one was a very young artillery man, who only a few days earlier had come to town from a military academy, a taciturn boy who hadn’t yet managed to make any friends, and who now suddenly turned up at Virginsky’s, pencil in hand, and although taking practically no part in the conversation, was constantly writing something down in his notebook.2 Everyone saw it, but for some reason everyone tried to pretend that they didn’t notice. There was also a do-nothing seminarian, who had joined Lyamshin in slipping pornographic photographs into the book-pedlar’s bag, a sturdy lad with an easygoing yet at the same time mistrustful manner, an accusing smile pasted on his face, yet with a calm look of the triumphant conviction that he embodied perfection. Also present, I don’t know why, was our mayor’s son, that same nasty boy, dissolute beyond his years, whom I’ve already mentioned while I was telling the story of the second lieutenant’s little wife. He said nothing the entire evening. And finally, in conclusion, a certain high-school student, an extremely hot-tempered and dishevelled boy of about eighteen, who was sitting with the sullen look of a young man whose dignity had been offended and who evidently was suffering for his eighteen years. This scrap of a lad was already the leader of an independent group of conspirators that had been formed in the school’s senior class, a fact that subsequently came to light, to the astonishment of all. I haven’t mentioned Shatov: he had installed himself right there at a far corner of the table, after moving his chair slightly out of the row, looked at the floor, maintained a sullen silence, refused tea and bread, and never let go of his cap, as if wishing in this way to announce that he wasn’t a guest but had come on business, and when he felt like it, would get up and leave. Kirillov had taken his place not far from him, and was also very quiet, but wasn’t looking at the floor; on the contrary, he was fixing his steady, lustreless eyes on everyone who was speaking and listening closely to everything without the slightest emotion or surprise. Some of the guests who had never seen him before were surveying him thoughtfully and stealthily. I can’t say whether Madame Virginskaya knew anything about the existence of the group of five. I suppose she knew everything, and most probably from her husband. As for the girl student, she of course took no part in anything, but she had her own concerns: she was intending to spend only a day or two visiting, and then move on farther and farther afield, to all the university towns, in order to ‘participate in the sufferings of the poor students and incite them to protest’. She was carrying with her several hundred copies of a lithographed appeal, which she had apparently composed herself. Remarkably, the high-school student conceived an almost murderous hatred for her at first glance, although this was the first time in his life he had ever seen her, and she felt the same way about him. The major was an uncle of hers and that day was the first time he had seen her in ten years. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky came in, her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just had a fierce quarrel with her uncle over his views on the woman question.","Speaking of outsiders, I also have an idea that the above-named members of the first fivesome were inclined to suspect that among Virginsky's guests that evening there were members of other groups unknown to them, also started in town from the same secret organization, and by the selfsame Verkhovensky, so that in the end all of those gathered suspected each other, and assumed various postures in front of each other, which indeed lent the whole gathering a rather incoherent and even partly romantic appearance. However, there were also people there who were beyond any suspicion. Such, for example, was one active army major, Virginsky's close relative, a completely innocent man, who had not even been invited, but had come on his own to celebrate the name day, so that it was simply impossible not to receive him. But anyhow Virginsky was not worried, because the major ""simply could not denounce them""; for, despite all his stupidity, he had been fond throughout his life of scurrying around all those places where extreme liberals are to be found; did not sympathize himself, but liked very much to listen. Moreover, he had even been compromised once: it so happened that in his youth whole warehouses of The Bell2 and various tracts had passed through his hands, and though he had been afraid even to unfold them, he would still have regarded the refusal to disseminate them as perfect baseness-and there are some Russians of his sort even to this day. The remainder of the guests represented either the type of noble amour-propre crushed to the point of bile, or the type of the first and noblest impulse of fervent youth. These were two or three teachers, one of whom was lame, already about forty-five, an instructor in the high school, an extremely venomous and remarkably vain man, and two or three officers. Of the latter, one was a very young artillerist who had arrived just the other day from some military school, a silent boy who had not yet had time to make acquaintances, and who now suddenly turned up at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand and, almost without taking part in the conversation, kept jotting things down in his notebook. Everyone saw this, but for some reason everyone tried to make it seem as if they had not noticed. There was also the loaf-about seminarian who together with Lyamshin had slipped the vile photographs into the book-hawker's bag, a big fellow with a free and easy but at the same time mistrustful manner, with a perpetually accusatory smile, and along with that a calm look of triumphant perfection contained within himself. There was, I have no idea why, also the son of our mayor, that same nasty boy, dissipated beyond his years, whom I have already mentioned while telling the story of the lieutenant's little wife. He was silent all evening. And finally, in conclusion, there was a high-school student, a very hot-headed and disheveled boy of about eighteen, who sat with the glum look of a young man whose dignity has been insulted, and suffered visibly on account of his eighteen years. This mite of a lad was already the head of an independent crew of conspirators formed in the upper grade of the high school, which fact was discovered afterwards to general amazement. I have not mentioned Shatov: he was sitting right there at the far corner of the table , his chair moved slightly out of line; he looked down, was gloomily silent, refused tea and bread, and would not let go of his peaked cap all the while, as if wishing thereby to declare that he was not a guest but had come on business, and could get up and leave whenever he liked. Not far from him sat Kirillov, also quite silent, though he did not look down but, on the contrary, examined each speaker point-blank with his fixed, lusterless stare, and listened to everything without the least emotion or surprise. Some of the guests who had never seen him before studied him stealthily and pensively. It is not known whether Madame Virginsky herself knew anything about the existence of the fivesome. I suppose she knew everything, and precisely from her husband. The girl student, of course, did not participate in any way, but she had her own concern: she intended to stay only for a day or two, and then go on farther and farther, to all the university towns, to ""share the suffering lot of the poor students and arouse them to protest. "" She was bringing with her several hundred lithographed copies of an appeal- of her own composition, it would seem. Remarkably, the high-school boy hated her from first sight almost to the point of blood vengeance, though it was the first time he had seen her in his life, and she him. The major was her uncle, and met her that day for the first time in ten years. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky entered, her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just had a spat with her uncle over their views of the woman question."

"Я, однако, сбегал к нему еще раз за кулисы и успел предупредить, вне себя, что, по моему мнению, всё лопнуло и что лучше ему вовсе не выходить, а сейчас же уехать домой, отговорившись хоть холериной, а я бы тоже скинул бант и с ним отправился.

"И она быстро зашептала ему, оглядываясь на запертую дверь, чтобы кто не подслушал, – что здесь, в этой деревне, беда-с. Что все здешние мужики хотя и рыболовы, а что тем собственно и промышляют, что каждым летом с постояльцев берут плату, какую только им вздумается. Деревня эта не проезжая, а глухая, и что потому только и приезжают сюда, что здесь пароход останавливается, и что когда пароход не приходит, потому чуть-чуть непогода, так он ни за что не придет, – то наберется народу за несколько дней, и уж тут все избы по деревне заняты, а хозяева только того и ждут; потому за каждый предмет в три цены берут, и хозяин здешний гордый и надменный, потому что уж очень по здешнему месту богат; у него невод один тысячу рублей стоит.","And she quickly whispered to him, looking around at the locked door, so that no one would overhear, - that here, in this village, the trouble is, sir. That all the peasants here, although they are fishermen, but that they actually hunt for it, that every summer they take payment from the guests, whatever they please. This village is not passable, but deaf, and that the only reason they come here is that the steamer stops here, and that when the steamer does not come, because it’s a little bad weather, it will never come, then it will gather people in a few days, and already here all the huts in the village are occupied, and the owners are only waiting for this; therefore, they charge three times the price for each item, and the local owner is proud and arrogant, because he is already very rich in this place; he has a net worth one thousand rubles.","And she quickly began whispering to him, glancing round at the closed door lest anyone be eavesdropping, that here, in this village, there was real trouble. That all the local muzhiks, though fishermen, actually earned their living during the summer by extracting from travellers whatever payment they fancied.

"Все совершившиеся бесчинства и преступления обнаружились с чрезвычайною быстротой, гораздо быстрее, чем предполагал Петр Степанович. Началось с того, что несчастная Марья Игнатьевна в ночь убийства мужа проснулась пред рассветом, хватилась его и пришла в неописанное волнение, не видя его подле себя. С ней ночевала нанятая тогда Ариной Прохоровной прислужница. Та никак не могла ее успокоить и, чуть лишь стало светать, побежала за самой Ариной Прохоровной, уверив больную, что та знает, где ее муж и когда он воротится. Между тем и Арина Прохоровна находилась тоже в некоторой заботе: она уже узнала от своего мужа о ночном подвиге в Скворешниках. Он воротился домой часу уже в одиннадцатом ночи, в ужасном состоянии и виде; ломая руки, бросился ничком на кровать и всё повторял, сотрясаясь от конвульсивных рыданий: «Это не то, не то; это совсем не то!» Разумеется, кончил тем, что признался приступившей к нему Арине Прохоровне во всем – впрочем, только ей одной во всем доме. Та оставила его в постели, строго внушив, что «если хочет хныкать, то ревел бы в подушку, чтоб не слыхали, и что дурак он будет, если завтра покажет какой-нибудь вид». Она таки призадумалась и тотчас же начала прибираться на всякий случай: лишние бумаги, книги, даже, может быть, прокламации, успела припрятать или истребить дотла. За всем тем рассудила, что собственно ей, ее сестре, тетке, студентке, а может быть, и вислоухому братцу бояться очень-то нечего. Когда к утру прибежала за ней сиделка, она пошла к Марье Игнатьевне не задумавшись. Ей, впрочем, ужасно хотелось поскорее проведать, верно ли то, что вчера испуганным и безумным шепотом, похожим на бред, сообщил ей супруг о расчетах Петра Степановича, в видах общей пользы, на Кириллова.","All committed atrocities and crimes were revealed with extreme speed, much faster than Pyotr Stepanovich had expected. It began with the fact that the unfortunate Marya Ignatyevna woke up before dawn on the night of her husband's murder, missed him and went into indescribable excitement, not seeing him beside her. A servant hired then by Arina Prokhorovna spent the night with her. She could not calm her down in any way and, as soon as it began to get light, she ran after Arina Prokhorovna herself, assuring the patient that she knew where her husband was and when he would return. Meanwhile, Arina Prokhorovna was also in some kind of concern: she had already learned from her husband about the nightly feat in Skvoreshniki. He returned home at one o'clock already at eleven at night, in a terrible state and appearance; wringing his arms, he flung himself prone on the bed and repeated everything, shaking with convulsive sobs: “This is not that, not that; it's not like that at all!"" Of course, he ended by confessing everything to Arina Prokhorovna, who had approached him - however, only to her in the whole house. She left him in bed, sternly suggesting that ""if he wanted to whimper, he would roar into the pillow so that they would not hear, and that he would be a fool if tomorrow he showed some kind."" She became thoughtful and immediately began to tidy up just in case: she managed to hide or destroy the extra papers, books, even, perhaps, proclamations. Behind all this, she reasoned that she, her sister, her aunt, the student, and perhaps even her lop-eared brother, had nothing to be afraid of. When the nurse came running for her in the morning, she went to Marya Ignatievna without thinking. However, she was terribly anxious to find out as soon as possible whether it was true that yesterday, in a frightened and insane whisper, like delirium, her husband had told her about Pyotr Stepanovich's calculations, in the form of general benefits, for Kirillov.","All the outrages and crimes that had been committed came to light with extraordinary rapidity, much more rapidly than Pyotr Stepanovich had supposed. It all began when the unfortunate Marya Ignatyevna, the night of her husband’s murder, woke up before dawn, found that he wasn’t there and became indescribably agitated when she didn’t see him beside her. A servant woman Arina Prokhorovna had hired to spend the night with her was unable to calm her down, and as soon as it began to grow light, she ran to fetch Arina Prokhorovna herself, after assuring the sick woman that the midwife knew where her husband was and when he would return. Meanwhile, Arina Prokhorovna was also in a state of some anxiety: she had already found out from her husband about the nocturnal exploit in Skvoreshniki. He had returned home after eleven, his appearance and state of mind were dreadful; wringing his hands, he threw himself down on the bed and kept repeating, convulsed with sobbing: ‘It’s not right, not right. It’s absolutely not right!’ Arina Prokhorovna confronted him, and naturally, the result was that he confessed everything to her — but to her alone of all the people in the house. She left him in bed, sternly insisting that ‘if he wanted to be a baby about it then he should howl into his pillow, so that no one would hear, and that he would be a fool to show any sign of it on his face the next day’. Still and all, she gave it some thought, and immediately began to tidy up, just in case: she managed to hide or completely destroy any papers they didn’t need, books, and even perhaps manifestos. Yet despite everything, she didn’t think that she, her sister, her aunt, the young woman student and perhaps even her lop-eared brother had very much to fear at all. When the nurse ran in to fetch her in the morning, she went off to Marya Ignatyevna without giving it another thought. However, she was dreadfully anxious to find out whether it was true what her husband had told her the night before, in a frightened, demented and almost delirious whisper, about Pyotr Stepanovich counting on Kirillov in the interests of the common cause.","All the perpetrated outrages and crimes were discovered extraordinarily quickly, far more quickly than Pyotr Stepanovich had supposed. It began with the unfortunate Marya Ignatievna, who woke up before dawn on the night of her husband's murder, found him missing, and became indescribably worried at not seeing him beside her. The servingwoman Arina Prokhorovna had hired then was spending the night with her. She simply could not calm her down and, as soon as day broke, went running for Arina Prokhorovna herself, assuring the sick woman that she would know where her husband was and when he would be back. Meanwhile, Arina Prokhorovna had troubles of her own: she had already learned from her husband about the night's exploit at Skvoreshniki. He had returned home past ten o'clock looking and feeling terrible; clasping his hands, he threw himself facedown on the bed and kept repeating, shaking with convulsive sobs: "" This is not it, this is not it; this is not it at all!"" Arina Prokhorovna accosted him and, of course, he ended by confessing everything to her-though to her alone in the whole house. She left him in bed, sternly impressing upon him that ""if he wanted to blubber, he should do his howling into the pillow so that no one would hear, and that he'd be a fool if he showed any such appearance tomorrow. "" She did become a bit pensive and immediately began tiding things up just in case: she managed to hide or destroy completely any unnecessary papers, books, perhaps even tracts. Yet, for all that, she in fact considered that she, her sister, her aunt, the girl student, and perhaps even her lop-eared brother, had nothing much to fear. When the nurse came running for her in the morning, she went to Marya Ignatievna without hesitation. However, she wanted terribly to find out all the sooner whether it was true what her husband had told her yesterday, in a frightened and insane whisper resembling delirium, about Pyotr Stepanovich's counting, with a view to common usefulness, on Kirillov."

"У него мелькнуло в ту минуту, что он не читал Евангелия по крайней мере лет тридцать и только разве лет семь назад припомнил из него капельку лишь по Ренановой книге «Vie de Jésus».[260] Так как у него мелочи не было, то он и вытащил свои четыре десятирублевые билета – всё, что у него было. Хозяйка взялась разменять, и тут только он заметил, всмотревшись, что в избу набралось довольно народу и что все давно уже наблюдают его и, кажется, о нем говорят.

The mistress of the house undertook to give him change, and only at that point did he notice, on looking closely, that rather a lot of folk had assembled in the hut and that they had been observing him for a long time now, and seemed to be talking about him.

"Пришли к дому Филиппова, но, еще не доходя, взяли проулком, или, лучше сказать, неприметною тропинкой вдоль забора, так что некоторое время пришлось пробираться по крутому откосу канавки, на котором нельзя было ноги сдержать и надо было хвататься за забор. В самом темном углу покривившегося забора Петр Степанович вынул доску; образовалось отверстие, в которое он тотчас же и пролез.

"Но тут с нею случилось маленькое несчастие. Должно быть, она неосторожно как-нибудь повернулась и ступила на свою больную, короткую ногу, – словом, она упала всем боком на кресло и, не будь этих кресел, полетела бы на пол. Он мигом подхватил ее и поддержал, крепко взял под руку и с участием, осторожно повел к дверям. Она видимо была огорчена своим падением, смутилась, покраснела и ужасно застыдилась. Молча смотря в землю, глубоко прихрамывая, она заковыляла за ним, почти повиснув на его руке. Так они и вышли. Лиза, я видел, для чего-то вдруг привскочила с кресла, пока они выходили, и неподвижным взглядом проследила их до самых дверей. Потом молча села опять, но в лице ее было какое-то судорожное движение, как будто она дотронулась до какого-то гада.","But then something bad happened to her. She must have inadvertently somehow turned around and stepped on her sore, short leg - in a word, she fell all over on an armchair and, had it not been for those armchairs, she would have fallen to the floor. He instantly grabbed her and supported her, firmly took her by the arm and, with participation, carefully led her to the door. She was apparently distressed by her fall, embarrassed, blushed, and terribly ashamed. Silently looking at the ground, limping deeply, she hobbled after him, almost hanging on his arm. So they went out. Lisa, I saw, for some reason suddenly jumped up from her chair while they were leaving, and with an immovable gaze followed them to the very doors. Then she silently sat down again, but there was some convulsive movement in her face, as if she had touched some reptile.","But at this point a small accident befell her.

She was obviously distressed at having fallen; she became flustered, flushed and dreadfully ashamed. Quietly looking at the floor, and limping heavily, she hobbled along behind him, almost hanging from his arm. And so they went out.

"Они съездили и прожили в Петербурге почти весь зимний сезон. Всё, однако, к великому посту лопнуло, как радужный мыльный пузырь. Мечты разлетелись, а сумбур не только не выяснился, но стал еще отвратительнее. Во-первых, высшие связи почти не удались, разве в самом микроскопическом виде и с унизительными натяжками. Оскорбленная Варвара Петровна бросилась было всецело в «новые идеи» и открыла у себя вечера. Она позвала литераторов, и к ней их тотчас же привели во множестве. Потом уже приходили и сами, без приглашения; один приводил другого. Никогда еще она не видывала таких литераторов. Они были тщеславны до невозможности, но совершенно открыто, как бы тем исполняя обязанность. Иные (хотя и далеко не все) являлись даже пьяные, но как бы сознавая в этом особенную, вчера только открытую красоту. Все они чем-то гордились до странности. На всех лицах было написано, что они сейчас только открыли какой-то чрезвычайно важный секрет. Они бранились, вменяя себе это в честь. Довольно трудно было узнать, что именно они написали; но тут были критики, романисты, драматурги, сатирики, обличители. Степан Трофимович проник даже в самый высший их круг, туда, откуда управляли движением. До управляющих было до невероятности высоко, но его они встретили радушно, хотя, конечно, никто из них ничего о нем не знал и не слыхивал кроме того, что он «представляет идею». Он до того маневрировал около них, что и их зазвал раза два в салон Варвары Петровны, несмотря на всё их олимпийство. Эти были очень серьезны и очень вежливы; держали себя хорошо; остальные видимо их боялись; но очевидно было, что им некогда. Явились и две-три прежние литературные знаменитости, случившиеся тогда в Петербурге и с которыми Варвара Петровна давно уже поддерживала самые изящные отношения. Но, к удивлению ее, эти действительные и уже несомненные знаменитости были тише воды, ниже травы, а иные из них просто льнули ко всему этому новому сброду и позорно у него заискивали. Сначала Степану Трофимовичу повезло; за него ухватились и стали его выставлять на публичных литературных собраниях. Когда он вышел в первый раз на эстраду, в одном из публичных литературных чтений, в числе читавших, раздались неистовые рукоплескания, не умолкавшие минут пять. Он со слезами вспоминал об этом девять лет спустя, – впрочем, скорее по художественности своей натуры, чем из благодарности. «Клянусь же вам и пари держу, – говорил он мне сам (но только мне и по секрету), – что никто-то изо всей этой публики знать не знал о мне ровнешенько ничего!» Признание замечательное: стало быть, был же в нем острый ум, если он тогда же, на эстраде, мог так ясно понять свое положение, несмотря на всё свое упоение; и, стало быть, не было в нем острого ума, если он даже девять лет спустя не мог вспомнить о том без ощущения обиды. Его заставили подписаться под двумя или тремя коллективными протестами (против чего – он и сам не знал); он подписался. Варвару Петровну тоже заставили подписаться под каким-то «безобразным поступком», и та подписалась. Впрочем, большинство этих новых людей хоть и посещали Варвару Петровну, но считали себя почему-то обязанными смотреть на нее с презрением и с нескрываемою насмешкой. Степан Трофимович намекал мне потом, в горькие минуты, что она с тех-то пор ему и позавидовала. Она, конечно, понимала, что ей нельзя водиться с этими людьми, но все-таки принимала их с жадностью, со всем женским истерическим нетерпением и, главное, всё чего-то ждала. На вечерах она говорила мало, хотя и могла бы говорить; но она больше вслушивалась. Говорили об уничтожении цензуры и буквы ъ, о заменении русских букв латинскими, о вчерашней ссылке такого-то, о каком-то скандале в Пассаже, о полезности раздробления России по народностям с вольною федеративною связью, об уничтожении армии и флота, о восстановлении Польши по Днепр, о крестьянской реформе и прокламациях, об уничтожении наследства, семейства, детей и священников, о правах женщины, о доме Краевского, которого никто и никогда не мог простить господину Краевскому, и пр., и пр. Ясно было, что в этом сброде новых людей много мошенников, но несомненно было, что много и честных, весьма даже привлекательных лиц, несмотря на некоторые все-таки удивительные оттенки. Честные были гораздо непонятнее бесчестных и грубых; но неизвестно было, кто у кого в руках. Когда Варвара Петровна объявила свою мысль об издании журнала, то к ней хлынуло еще больше народу, но тотчас же посыпались в глаза обвинения, что она капиталистка и эксплуатирует труд. Бесцеремонность обвинений равнялась только их неожиданности. Престарелый генерал Иван Иванович Дроздов, прежний друг и сослуживец покойного генерала Ставрогина, человек достойнейший (но в своем роде) и которого все мы здесь знаем, до крайности строптивый и раздражительный, ужасно много евший и ужасно боявшийся атеизма, заспорил на одном из вечеров Варвары Петровны с одним знаменитым юношей. Тот ему первым словом: «Вы, стало быть, генерал, если так говорите», то есть в том смысле, что уже хуже генерала он и брани не мог найти. Иван Иванович вспылил чрезвычайно: «Да, сударь, я генерал, и генерал-лейтенант, и служил государю моему, а ты, сударь, мальчишка и безбожник!» Произошел скандал непозволительный. На другой день случай был обличен в печати, и начала собираться коллективная подписка против «безобразного поступка» Варвары Петровны, не захотевшей тотчас же прогнать генерала. В иллюстрированном журнале явилась карикатура, в которой язвительно скопировали Варвару Петровну, генерала и Степана Трофимовича на одной картинке, в виде трех ретроградных друзей; к картинке приложены были и стихи, написанные народным поэтом единственно для этого случая. Замечу от себя, что действительно у многих особ в генеральских чинах есть привычка смешно говорить: «Я служил государю моему…», то есть точно у них не тот же государь, как и у нас, простых государевых подданных, а особенный, ихний.","They went and lived in St. Petersburg for almost the entire winter season. Everything, however, burst before Lent like a rainbow soap bubble. Dreams scattered, and the confusion not only did not clear up, but became even more disgusting. Firstly, the higher connections almost failed, except in the most microscopic form and with humiliating exaggerations. Insulted, Varvara Petrovna threw herself wholly into the ""new ideas"" and opened evenings at her place. She called the writers, and they were immediately brought to her in multitudes. Then they came themselves, without an invitation; one brought the other. She had never seen such writers before. They were conceited to the point of impossibility, but quite openly, as if fulfilling a duty. Some (although by no means all) even appeared drunk, but as if recognizing in this a special, yesterday only revealed beauty. They were all proud of something strangely. It was written on all their faces that they had just discovered some extremely important secret. They quarreled, imputing it to their honor. It was rather difficult to find out exactly what they had written; but there were critics, novelists, playwrights, satirists, accusers. Stepan Trofimovich penetrated even into their highest circle, from where they controlled the movement. It was incredibly high up to the managers, but they greeted him cordially, although, of course, none of them knew or heard anything about him except that he ""represents an idea."" He maneuvered around them to such an extent that he called them twice into Varvara Petrovna's salon, in spite of all their Olympism. These were very serious and very polite; behaved well; the rest were apparently afraid of them; but it was obvious that they had no time. There were also two or three former literary celebrities who happened then in St. Petersburg and with whom Varvara Petrovna had long maintained the most elegant relations. But, to her surprise, these real and already undoubted celebrities were quieter than water, lower than grass, and some of them simply clung to all this new rabble and shamefully curry favor with him. At first, Stepan Trofimovich was lucky; they seized on it and began to exhibit it at public literary meetings. When he went out on the stage for the first time, in one of the public literary readings, among those who read, there was a frantic applause that did not stop for about five minutes. Nine years later, he recalled this with tears - however, more due to the artistry of his nature than out of gratitude. “I swear to you and I bet,” he told me himself (but only to me and in confidence), “that no one from all this public knew absolutely nothing about me!” A remarkable confession: it follows that he had a sharp mind, if at that time, on the stage, he could understand his position so clearly, despite all his rapture; and, therefore, there was no sharp mind in him, if even nine years later he could not remember it without feeling offended. He was forced to sign two or three collective protests (against what he himself did not know); he signed up. Varvara Petrovna was also forced to sign under some kind of ""ugly deed"", and she signed. However, although most of these new people visited Varvara Petrovna, for some reason they considered themselves obliged to look at her with contempt and with undisguised mockery. Stepan Trofimovich hinted to me later, in bitter moments, that she had envied him ever since. She, of course, understood that she was not allowed to associate with these people, but all the same she received them greedily, with all the hysterical impatience of a woman, and, most importantly, kept waiting for something. At parties she spoke little, though she might have; but she listened more. They talked about the abolition of censorship and the letter ъ, about the replacement of Russian letters with Latin ones, about yesterday's exile of such and such, about some scandal in the Passage, about the usefulness of splitting Russia into ethnic groups with a free federal connection, about the destruction of the army and navy, about the restoration of Poland according to Dnieper, about the peasant reform and proclamations, about the destruction of the inheritance, family, children and priests, about the rights of women, about the house of Kraevsky, whom no one could ever forgive Mr. Kraevsky, etc., etc. It was clear that in this rabble new people are many swindlers, but there were undoubtedly many honest, even very attractive faces, despite some surprising shades. The honest were much more incomprehensible than the dishonest and rude; but it was not known who was in whose hands. When Varvara Petrovna announced her idea of publishing a magazine, even more people rushed to her, but accusations immediately fell into her eyes that she was a capitalist and exploited labor. The impudence of the accusations was only equaled by their surprise. The aged General Ivan Ivanovich Drozdov, a former friend and colleague of the late General Stavrogin, a worthy man (but in his own way) and whom we all know here, extremely obstinate and irritable, who ate terribly much and was terribly afraid of atheism, argued at one of Varvara Petrovna's evenings with a famous young man. He told him with the first word: “You, therefore, are a general, if you say so,” that is, in the sense that he could not even find scolding worse than a general. Ivan Ivanovich flared up extremely: “Yes, sir, I am a general, and a lieutenant general, and served my sovereign, and you, sir, are a boy and an atheist!” There was an unacceptable scandal. The next day, the case was denounced in the press, and a collective signature began to be collected against the ""ugly act"" of Varvara Petrovna, who did not want to immediately drive the general away. In an illustrated magazine there was a caricature in which Varvara Petrovna, the general and Stepan Trofimovich were sarcastically copied in one picture, in the form of three retrograde friends; Attached to the picture were also poems written by a folk poet solely for this occasion. I note from myself that indeed many persons in the ranks of generals have a habit of saying funny: “I served my sovereign ...”, that is, they definitely do not have the same sovereign as we, ordinary sovereign subjects, but special, theirs.","They went off to Petersburg and lived there for almost the entire winter season. By Lent, however, everything had burst like a rainbow-coloured bubble. Their dreams melted away, and the fog of confusion not only didn’t clear up, but became even more repellent. In the first place, the high connections virtually failed to materialize, except in the most microscopic form and only after humiliating efforts. An offended Varvara Petrovna tried to throw herself headlong into the ‘new ideas’, and began giving soirees29 at her place. She invited literary people, and they were immediately brought to her in great numbers. Then they began to come on their own, without invitations: one would bring another. Never before had she seen men of letters like these. They were impossibly vain, but very openly so, as if that was their duty. Some (though by no means all) would even turn up drunk, but they seemed to see this as evidence of some beautiful, special truth that had been discovered only the day before. All of them were strangely proud of something. On all their faces it was written that they had just discovered some extremely important secret. They would abuse each other, and reckon it to their honour. It was rather difficult to determine just what they had written; but critics, novelists, playwrights, satirists and specialists in exposes were in attendance. Stepan Trofimovich even penetrated their very highest circle, from which the movement was directed. He had an impossibly long way to climb before he reached the people in charge, but he received a hearty welcome, although none of them, of course, knew anything about him and had heard nothing except that he ‘represented an idea’. He manoeuvred so skilfully around them that on two occasions he managed to persuade them to put in an appearance at Varvara Petrovna’s salon as well, despite all their Olympian detachment. These men were very serious and very polite; they comported themselves well; the others were evidently afraid of them; but it was obvious that they had no time for anyone else. Two or three former literary luminaries who happened to be in Petersburg just then and with whom Varvara Petrovna had long maintained the most refined relations, also turned up. But to her surprise, these genuine and certainly incontestable luminaries never uttered a peep, and some of them tried to ingratiate themselves with all this new rabble and shamelessly sucked up to them. At first Stepan Trofimovich fared well. People took him up and began presenting him at public literary gatherings. When he walked out on stage for the first time to take his turn at one of the public literary readings, there was a burst of frenzied clapping, which didn’t subside for a good five minutes. Nine years later he recalled this with tears, but more because of his artistic nature than out of gratitude. ‘I swear to you, and I’m prepared to wager,’ he himself said to me (but only to me, and in secret), ‘that not a single member of this entire audience knew a thing about me — absolutely nothing!’ An extraordinary admission: it followed that he had a keen intelligence if he was able, then and there, on that stage, to understand his position so clearly, despite all his excitement; and it further followed that he did not have a keen intelligence if even nine years later he couldn’t recall this episode without feeling offended. He was compelled to sign his name to two or three collective protests (against what, he himself had no idea); he signed. Varvara Petrovna was also compelled to sign in protest against some ‘outrageous act’,30 and she signed. However, the majority of these new people, although they did pay visits to Varvara Petrovna, regarded themselves as somehow obliged to regard her with contempt and unconcealed mockery. Stepan Trofimovich later hinted to me, in moments of bitterness, that her envy of him dated from precisely that time. Of course, she understood that she shouldn’t associate with these people, yet she continued to receive them eagerly, with all the impatience of a hysterical woman, and, most importantly, kept waiting for something to happen. She had little to say at her soirees, although she could have said a lot; instead, she mostly listened carefully. The talk was of the abolition of censorship and of spelling reforms, of the substitution of the Latin alphabet for the Russian, of the exile of someone the day before, of some scandal in the Arcade, of the advantages of splitting up Russia by nationalities, which would be united in a voluntary federation, of the abolition of the army and the navy, of the restoration of Poland as far as the Dnieper River, of the peasant reform and of leaflets, of the abolition of inheritance, the family, children, and priests, of the rights of women, of Krayevsky’s house,31 for which no one could ever forgive Mr Krayevsky, and so on and so forth. It was obvious that this clutch of dubious new people contained many scoundrels, but there was no doubt that it also contained many honest, even very attractive persons, despite certain subtle but nonetheless surprising shades of difference. The honest ones were much harder to understand than the dishonest and rude ones; but it couldn’t be ascertained who was at whose beck and call. When Varvara Petrovna announced her idea of establishing a magazine, even more people surged to her soirees, but accusations that she was a capitalist and an exploiter of labour were immediately hurled in her face. The unceremoniousness of these accusations was equalled only by their unexpectedness. The superannuated General Ivan Ivanovich Drozdov, a former friend and colleague of the late General Stavrogin, a most honourable man (but in his own way), and known to all of us here, a man who was extremely obstinate and short-tempered, who ate an awful lot and was awfully afraid of atheism, began to quarrel at one of Varvara Petrovna’s soirees with a certain celebrated young man. The latter promptly retorted: ‘You must be a general if you talk like that’, meaning, in other words, that he could come up with no greater term of abuse than ‘general’. Ivan Ivanovich rose to the bait at once: ‘Yes, sir, I am a general, and a lieutenant general, and I have served my Sovereign, and you, sir, are an impudent boy and an atheist!’ A dreadful scene ensued. The next day the incident was reported in the press, and people began collecting signatures for a petition against the ‘outrageous conduct’ of Varvara Petrovna, who had refused to banish the general instantly from her house. A cartoon appeared in an illustrated magazine,32 where Varvara Petrovna, the general and Stepan Trofimovich were caricatured all together as three reactionary friends; the cartoon was also accompanied by some verses, written by the people’s poet exclusively for this occasion. I will note, for my part, that many persons with the rank of general really do have the absurd habit of saying ‘I have served my Sovereign’, that is, as if they had a different Sovereign from the rest of us ordinary subjects of the Tsar, as if he were theirs alone, someone special.","They went and stayed in Petersburg for almost the whole winter season. By Lent, however, everything burst like an iridescent soap bubble. The dreams scattered, and the jumble not only was not clarified, but became even more repellent. First, the high connections all but failed, except perhaps in microscopic form, and with humiliating strain. The insulted Varvara Petrovna threw herself wholly into the ""new ideas"" and began holding evenings. She invited writers, and they were immediately brought to her in great numbers. Afterwards they took to coming on their own, without invitation, each one bringing another. Never before had she seen such writers. They were impossibly vain, but quite openly so, as if thereby fulfilling a duty. Some (though by no means all) even came drunk, but it was as if they perceived some special, just-yesterday-discovered beauty in it. They were all proud of something to the point of strangeness. It was written on all their faces that they had just discovered some extremely important secret. They were abusive, and considered it to their credit. It was rather difficult to find out precisely what they had written; but there were critics, novelists, playwrights, satirists, exposers among them. Stepan Trofimovich even penetrated their highest circle, the place from which the movement was directed. It was an immensely steep climb to reach the directors, but they met him cordially, though none of them, of course, knew or had heard anything about him except that he ""represented an idea."" He maneuvered among them so far that he even managed to invite them a couple of times to Varvara Petrovna's salon, despite all their olympianity. These were very serious and very polite people; they bore themselves well; the others were evidently afraid of them; but it was obvious that they had no time. Two or three former literary celebrities who then happened to be in Petersburg, and with whom Varvara Petrovna had long maintained the most refined relations, also came. But, to her surprise, these real and indisputable celebrities were meek as lambs, and some of them simply clung to all this new rabble and fawned on them shamefully. At first Stepan Trofimovich was in luck; they seized on him and began displaying him at public literary gatherings. When he came out on the platform for the first time as a reader at one of these public literary readings, there was a burst of wild applause that continued for about five minutes. He recalled it with tears nine years later-rather more because of his artistic nature than out of gratitude. ""I swear to you and will wager,"" he himself said to me (but only to me, and as a secret), ""that no one in that whole audience knew a blessed thing about me!"" A remarkable confession: indeed he must have possessed keen intelligence if he could understand his position so clearly, right there on the platform, despite all his rapture; and indeed he must not have possessed very keen intelligence if even nine years later he could not recall it without feeling offended. He was made to sign two or three collective protests (against what, he himself did not know); he signed. Varvara Petrovna was also made to sign some ""outrageous act,"" and she signed.15 However, though the majority of these new people had been Varvara Petrovna's guests, they for some reason considered it their duty to look upon her with contempt and unconcealed derision. Stepan Trofimovich hinted to me afterwards, in bitter moments, that it was then that she had begun to envy him. Of course, she understood that she ought not to associate with these people, but still she received them avidly, with all of a woman's hysterical impatience, and, above all, kept expecting something. At her evenings she spoke little, though she could speak, but rather listened. They talked about the abolition of censorship, about spelling reform, about replacing Russian letters with Roman, about someone's exile the day before, about some scandal in the Passage, about the advantages of dividing Russia into a free federation of nationalities, about abolishing the army and navy, about restoring Poland up to the Dnieper, about peasant reform and tracts, about the abolition of inheritance, the family, children, and priests, about women's rights, about Kraevsky's house, for which no one would ever forgive Mr. Kraevsky, and so on and so forth.16 It was clear that among this rabble of new people there were many swindlers, but it was also unquestionable that there were many honest and even quite attractive persons, despite certain nonetheless surprising nuances. The honest ones were far more incomprehensible than the rude and dishonest ones; but it was not clear who was making use of whom. When Varvara Petrovna announced her idea of publishing a magazine, still more people came flocking to her, but accusations also immediately flew in her face that she was a capitalist and an exploiter of labor. The unceremoniousness of the accusations was equaled only by their unexpectedness. The elderly general Ivan Ivanovich Drozdov, a former friend and fellow officer of the late general Stavrogin, a most worthy man (though in his own way), known to all of us here, extremely obstinate and irritable, who ate terribly much and was terribly afraid of atheism, began arguing at one of Varvara Petrovna's evenings with a famous young man. The latter said straight off: ""Well, you're a general if you talk like that,"" meaning that he could not even find any worse abuse than a general. Ivan Ivanovich got extremely fired up: "" Yes, sir, I am a general, a lieutenant general, and I've served my sovereign, and you, sir, are a brat and an atheist!"" An impossible scandal took place. Next day the incident was exposed in the press and signatures were gathered under a collective letter against the ""outrageous act"" of Varvara Petrovna in not wishing to throw the general out at once. A caricature appeared in an illustrated magazine, caustically portraying Varvara Petrovna, the general, and Stepan Trofimovich together as three retrograde cronies; the picture was accompanied by some verses written by a people's poet solely for the occasion. I will add, for my part, that in fact many persons with the rank of general have the habit of saying ludicrously: ""I have served my sovereign..."" as if they did not have the same sovereign as the rest of us, the sovereign's ordinary subjects, but their own special one."

"В этой фабрике Шпигулиных только что началась тогда та самая «шпигулинская история», о которой так много у нас прокричали и которая с такими вариантами перешла и в столичные газеты. Недели с три назад заболел там и умер один рабочий азиатскою холерой; потом заболело еще несколько человек. Все в городе струсили, потому что холера надвигалась из соседней губернии. Замечу, что у нас были приняты по возможности удовлетворительные санитарные меры для встречи непрошеной гостьи. Но фабрику Шпигулиных, миллионеров и людей со связями, как-то просмотрели. И вот вдруг все стали вопить, что в ней-то и таится корень и рассадник болезни, что на самой фабрике и особенно в помещениях рабочих такая закоренелая нечистота, что если б и не было совсем холеры, то она должна была бы там сама зародиться. Меры, разумеется, были тотчас же приняты, и Андрей Антонович энергически настоял на немедленном их исполнении. Фабрику очистили недели в три, но Шпигулины неизвестно почему ее закрыли. Один брат Шпигулин постоянно проживал в Петербурге, а другой, после распоряжения начальства об очистке, уехал в Москву. Управляющий приступил к расчету работников и, как теперь оказывается, нагло мошенничал. Работники стали роптать, хотели расчета справедливого, по глупости ходили в полицию, впрочем без большого крика и вовсе уж не так волновались. Вот в это-то время и доставлены были Андрею Антоновичу прокламации от управляющего.","In this factory of the Shpigulins, that very “Shpigulin story” had just begun then, about which we shouted so much and which, with such variants, also passed into the capital's newspapers. About three weeks ago, one worker fell ill there and died of Asiatic cholera; Then a few more people got sick. Everyone in the city was scared, because cholera was approaching from the neighboring province. I note that we have taken as satisfactory sanitary measures as possible to meet the uninvited guest. But the factory of the Shpigulins, millionaires and people with connections, was somehow overlooked. And then suddenly everyone began to cry out that the root and hotbed of the disease was hidden in it, that in the factory itself, and especially in the workers’ quarters, there was such deep-seated uncleanness that if there hadn’t been cholera at all, then it should have arisen there by itself. The measures, of course, were immediately taken, and Andrei Antonovich energetically insisted on their immediate implementation. The factory was cleared in about three weeks, but the Shpigulins closed it for no known reason. One brother Shpigulin permanently lived in St. Petersburg, and the other, after the order of the authorities to clean up, left for Moscow. The manager proceeded to calculate the employees and, as it now turns out, brazenly cheated. The workers began to grumble, they wanted a fair calculation, foolishly went to the police, however, without much shouting, they were not at all so worried. It was at this time that the proclamations from the manager were delivered to Andrey Antonovich.","This Shpigulin factory had just then seen the beginnings of the so-called ‘Shpigulin story’ that caused such an outcry among us and had found its way into the Petersburg and Moscow newspapers with many variations. About three weeks earlier a worker had been taken ill and died there from Asian cholera; then several people had fallen sick. Everyone in town was terrified, because the cholera was moving in from the neighbouring province. I will note that satisfactory sanitary measures had been taken, as far as possible, to greet the uninvited guest. But somehow the factory of the Shpigulins, who were millionaires and people with connections, had been overlooked. And then everyone suddenly started clamouring that it was precisely there that the source and breeding-ground of the infection lurked, that in the factory itself and especially in the workers’ barracks there was such an entrenched lack of cleanliness that if there had been no cholera epidemic at all, it would have started there on its own. Of course, measures were promptly taken, and Andrey Antonovich vigorously insisted on their immediate implementation. The factory was cleaned up in about three weeks, but for some reason the Shpigulins shut it down. One Shpigulin brother lived permanently in Petersburg, and the other left for Moscow after the authorities had given the order for the clean-up. The manager proceeded to pay off the workers, and, as it now turns out, swindled them shamelessly. The workers started grumbling, they wanted a fair settlement, and rather stupidly went to the police, but without any great outcry and without really becoming terribly upset. It was precisely at that particular time that the manifestos were delivered to Andrey Antonovich by the manager.","In this factory of the Shpigulins there was just beginning that very ""Shpigulin story"" which caused so much shouting among us and was then passed on with such variations to the metropolitan newspapers.

Everyone in town got scared, because cholera was approaching from the neighboring province. I will note that all possibly satisfactory sanitary measures were taken in our town to meet the uninvited guest. But the factory of the Shpigulins, who were millionaires and people with connections, was somehow overlooked. And so everyone suddenly started screaming that it was there that the root and hotbed of disease lay and that the uncleanliness of the factory itself, and especially of the workers' quarters, was so inveterate that even if there had been no cholera, it would have generated there of itself. Naturally, measures were taken at once, and Andrei Antonovich vigorously insisted that they be carried out immediately. The factory was cleaned up in about three weeks, but then for some reason the Shpigulins closed it. One of the Shpigulin brothers resided permanently in Petersburg, and the other, after the order from the authorities about the cleaning, left for Moscow. The manager began paying off the workers and, as it now turns out, was brazenly cheating them. The workers began to murmur, wanted their rightful pay, were foolish enough to go to the police, though without making a great noise or really causing much trouble. It was just at this time that the tracts were turned in to Andrei Antonovich by the manager."

"Катастрофа с Лизой и смерть Марьи Тимофеевны произвели подавляющее впечатление на Шатова. Я уже упоминал, что в то утро я его мельком встретил, он показался мне как бы не в своем уме. Между прочим, сообщил, что накануне вечером, часов в девять (значит, часа за три до пожара), был у Марьи Тимофеевны. Он ходил поутру взглянуть на трупы, но, сколько знаю, в то утро показаний не давал нигде никаких. Между тем к концу дня в душе его поднялась целая буря и… и, кажется, могу сказать утвердительно, был такой момент в сумерки, что он хотел встать, пойти и – объявить всё. Что такое было это всё – про то он сам знал. Разумеется, ничего бы не достиг, а предал бы просто себя. У него не было никаких доказательств, чтоб изобличить только что совершившееся злодеяние, да и сам он имел об нем лишь смутные догадки, только для него одного равнявшиеся полному убеждению. Но он готов был погубить себя, лишь бы только «раздавить мерзавцев», – собственные его слова. Петр Степанович отчасти верно предугадал в нем этот порыв и сам знал, что сильно рискует, откладывая исполнение своего нового ужасного замысла до завтра. С его стороны тут было, по обыкновению, много самонадеянности и презрения ко всем этим «людишкам», а к Шатову в особенности. Он презирал Шатова уже давно за его «плаксивое идиотство», как выражался он о нем еще за границей, и твердо надеялся справиться с таким нехитрым человеком, то есть не выпускать его из виду во весь этот день и пресечь ему путь при первой опасности. И однако спасло «мерзавцев» еще на малое время лишь одно совершенно неожиданное, а ими совсем не предвиденное обстоятельство…","The disaster with Lisa and the death of Marya Timofeevna made an overwhelming impression on Shatov. I have already mentioned that I had a glimpse of him that morning, he seemed to me as if out of his mind. By the way, he said that the night before, at nine o'clock (which means three hours before the fire), he was at Marya Timofeevna's. He went in the morning to look at the corpses, but, as far as I know, he did not give any evidence anywhere that morning. Meanwhile, towards the end of the day, a whole storm arose in his soul and ... and, I think I can say in the affirmative, there was such a moment in the twilight that he wanted to get up, go and - announce everything. What it was all about - he himself knew about it. Of course, he would not achieve anything, but would simply betray himself. He did not have any evidence to expose the atrocity that had just happened, and he himself had only vague guesses about it, which for him alone amounted to complete conviction. But he was ready to destroy himself, if only to ""crush the bastards"" - his own words. Pyotr Stepanovich had partly correctly foreseen this impulse in him, and he himself knew that he was taking a big risk by postponing the execution of his new terrible plan until tomorrow. On his part, there was, as usual, a lot of arrogance and contempt for all these ""little people"", and for Shatov in particular. He had long despised Shatov for his ""wailing idiocy,"" as he expressed it about him while still abroad, and he firmly hoped to cope with such a simple man, that is, not to let him out of sight all that day and cut off his path at the first danger. And yet, for a short time, the “scoundrels” were saved only by one completely unexpected, and by them completely unforeseen circumstance ...","The disaster that had befallen Liza and the death of Marya Timofeyevna had produced an overwhelming impression on Shatov. I have already mentioned that I encountered him in passing that morning, and he struck me as being not quite in his right mind. Incidentally, he told me that the night before, at about nine o’clock (in other words, two hours before the fire), he had been at Marya Timofeyevna’s. He had gone there the next morning to have a look at the bodies, but as far as I know, on that morning he gave absolutely no evidence anywhere. Meanwhile, by the end of the day a veritable storm had arisen in his heart and… and I think I can say positively that there was a certain moment at dusk when he wanted to get up, go and speak out about everything. What exactly this everything was — only he himself knew. Naturally, he would have achieved nothing, but would simply have betrayed himself. He had no evidence that would throw light on the evil deed that had just been committed, and what’s more, he himself could make only vague surmises about it which were tantamount for him alone to complete conviction. But he was prepared to doom himself provided he could ‘crush the scoundrels’ — his own words. Pyotr Stepanovich was partly right in guessing that this impulse lay within him and knew that he was taking a great risk in postponing the execution of his dreadful new plan until the next day. Here, as usual, he had a great deal of self-confidence and contempt for all these ‘petty little people’, and for Shatov in particular. He had long held Shatov in contempt for his ‘whining idiocy’, as he himself characterized it while he was still abroad, and had every expectation of dealing with such a guileless man, that is, by not letting him out of sight that whole day and stopping him in his tracks at the first sign of danger.

"Но странно было бы описывать их разговор. А между тем оба шли рука в руку, скоро, спеша, словно полоумные. Они направлялись прямо на пожар. Маврикий Николаевич всё еще не терял надежды встретить хоть какую-нибудь телегу, но никто не попадался. Мелкий, тонкий дождь проницал всю окрестность, поглощая всякий отблеск и всякий оттенок и обращая всё в одну дымную, свинцовую, безразличную массу. Давно уже был день, а казалось, всё еще не рассвело. И вдруг из этой дымной, холодной мглы вырезалась фигура, странная и нелепая, шедшая им навстречу. Воображая теперь, думаю, что я бы не поверил глазам, если б даже был на месте Лизаветы Николаевны; а между тем она радостно вскрикнула и тотчас узнала подходившего человека. Это был Степан Трофимович. Как он ушел, каким образом могла осуществиться безумная, головная идея его бегства – о том впереди. Упомяну лишь, что в это утро он был уже в лихорадке, но и болезнь не остановила его: он твердо шагал по мокрой земле; видно было, что обдумал предприятие, как только мог это сделать лучше, один при всей своей кабинетной неопытности. Одет был «по-дорожному», то есть шинель в рукава, а подпоясан широким кожаным лакированным поясом с пряжкой, при этом высокие новые сапоги и панталоны в голенищах. Вероятно, он так давно уже воображал себе дорожного человека, а пояс и высокие сапоги с блестящими гусарскими голенищами, в которых он не умел ходить, припас еще несколько дней назад. Шляпа с широкими полями, гарусный шарф, плотно обматывавший шею, палка в правой руке, а в левой чрезвычайно маленький, но чрезмерно туго набитый саквояж довершали костюм. Вдобавок, в той же правой руке распущенный зонтик. Эти три предмета – зонтик, палку и саквояж – было очень неловко нести всю первую версту, а со второй и тяжело.","But it would be strange to describe their conversation. And meanwhile both walked hand in hand, quickly, hastily, as if mad. They were heading straight for the fire. Mavriky Nikolaevich still did not lose hope of meeting at least some kind of cart, but no one came across. Fine, thin rain penetrated the whole neighborhood, absorbing every reflection and every shade and turning everything into one smoky, leaden, indifferent mass. It had been daylight for a long time, but it seemed that it had not yet dawned. And suddenly, out of this smoky, cold haze, a figure cut out, strange and absurd, walking towards them. Imagining now, I think that I would not believe my eyes, even if I were in Lizaveta Nikolaevna's place; but meanwhile she cried out with joy, and at once recognized the approaching man. It was Stepan Trofimovich. How he left, how the crazy, head idea of his flight could be realized - about that ahead. I will only mention that this morning he was already in a fever, but the illness did not stop him either: he walked firmly on the wet earth; it was evident that he had thought over the undertaking as best he could, alone, with all his armchair inexperience. He was dressed ""in a travel way"", that is, an overcoat in the sleeves, and girded with a wide patent leather belt with a buckle, while high new boots and pantaloons in the tops. Probably, he had been imagining a man of the road for so long, and he had saved up a belt and high boots with shiny hussar tops, in which he did not know how to walk, a few days ago. A wide-brimmed hat, a wide-brimmed scarf wrapped tightly around the neck, a stick in the right hand, and in the left an extremely small but overly stuffed bag completed the costume. In addition, in the same right hand, an open umbrella. These three items - an umbrella, a stick and a bag - were very awkward to carry the entire first verst, and from the second it was hard.","But it would be strange to try to describe their conversation. Meanwhile they walked hand in hand, rapidly, hurriedly, as if they were half mad. They were making their way directly to the fire. Mavriky Nikolayevich still had not lost hope of perhaps coming across a cart, but no one came along. A fine drizzle was enveloping everything around them, swallowing up every reflection and every hue, and turning everything into a smoky, leaden-grey, featureless mass. It had long since been daylight, but it seemed as if dawn had not yet broken. And suddenly out of this smoky, cold mist a figure took shape, strange and awkward, walking towards them. Imagining it now, I don’t think I would have believed my eyes, even if I had been in Lizaveta Nikolayevna’s place; but meanwhile she let out a shout of joy and immediately recognized the approaching man. It was Stepan Trofimovich. How he had gone off, how the insane idea of flight came to be realized — about that, later. I will merely mention that he already had a fever that morning, but even illness didn’t stop him: he was making his way firmly over the wet ground; it was obvious that he had planned his venture as best he could, given all his armchair inexperience. He was dressed ‘for the road’, that is, in a greatcoat with sleeves and a wide patent-leather belt with a buckle, along with new high boots with his trousers tucked into the tops. He had probably been imagining himself as a travelling man for a long time now, and several days ago had acquired the belt and the high boots with their shiny hussar tops in which he could hardly walk. The broad-brimmed hat, the worsted scarf that was snugly wound round his neck, a stick in his right hand, and in his left an extremely small but overpacked travelling bag completed his outfit. In addition, this same right hand held an unfurled umbrella. These three objects — the umbrella, the stick and the travelling bag — had been very awkward to carry the first verst of the way, and burdensome beginning with the second.","But it would be strange to describe their conversation. And meanwhile the two were walking arm in arm, quickly, hurrying, as if half crazed. They were making straight for the fire.

He was dressed in ""traveling fashion""-that is, in a greatcoat with sleeves and a wide patent-leather belt with a buckle, as well as high new boots with his trousers tucked into them. Probably he had long pictured a traveling man in this way, and several days earlier had provided himself with the belt and the high boots with their gleaming hussar tops, in which he did not know how to walk.

"Наш принц вдруг, ни с того ни с сего, сделал две-три невозможные дерзости разным лицам, то есть главное именно в том состояло, что дерзости эти совсем неслыханные, совершенно ни на что не похожие, совсем не такие, какие в обыкновенном употреблении, совсем дрянные и мальчишнические, и черт знает для чего, совершенно без всякого повода. Один из почтеннейших старшин нашего клуба, Павел Павлович Гаганов, человек пожилой и даже заслуженный, взял невинную привычку ко всякому слову с азартом приговаривать: «Нет-с, меня не проведут за нос!» Оно и пусть бы. Но однажды в клубе, когда он, по какому-то горячему поводу, проговорил этот афоризм собравшейся около него кучке клубных посетителей (и всё людей не последних), Николай Всеволодович, стоявший в стороне один и к которому никто и не обращался, вдруг подошел к Павлу Павловичу, неожиданно, но крепко ухватил его за нос двумя пальцами и успел протянуть за собою по зале два-три шага. Злобы он не мог иметь никакой на господина Гаганова. Можно было подумать, что это чистое школьничество, разумеется непростительнейшее; и, однако же, рассказывали потом, что он в самое мгновение операции был почти задумчив, «точно как бы с ума сошел»; но это уже долго спустя припомнили и сообразили. Сгоряча все сначала запомнили только второе мгновение, когда он уже наверно всё понимал в настоящем виде и не только не смутился, но, напротив, улыбался злобно и весело, «без малейшего раскаяния». Шум поднялся ужаснейший; его окружили. Николай Всеволодович повертывался и посматривал кругом, не отвечая никому и с любопытством приглядываясь к восклицавшим лицам. Наконец, вдруг как будто задумался опять, – так по крайней мере передавали, – нахмурился, твердо подошел к оскорбленному Павлу Павловичу и скороговоркой, с видимою досадой, пробормотал:","Our prince suddenly, for no reason at all, made two or three impossible insolences to different persons, that is, the main thing was precisely that these insolences were completely unheard of, completely unlike anything, not at all like those in ordinary use, completely trashy and boyish, and the devil knows why, for absolutely no reason. One of the most venerable foremen of our club, Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov, an elderly and even well-deserved man, took up the innocent habit of saying with excitement to every word: “No, they won’t take me by the nose!” Let it be. But one day in the club, when, on some hot occasion, he uttered this aphorism to a group of club visitors (and not the last people) gathered around him, Nikolai Vsevolodovich, who was standing aside alone and to whom no one addressed, suddenly approached Pavel Pavlovich, unexpectedly, but firmly grabbed him by the nose with two fingers and managed to stretch two or three steps behind him along the hall. He could not have any malice towards Mr. Gaganov. One might have thought that this was pure schoolboyism, of course the most unforgivable; and, however, they later said that at the very moment of the operation he was almost thoughtful, “as if he had gone crazy”; but this was long remembered and understood. In the heat of the moment, everyone at first remembered only the second moment, when he probably already understood everything in its true form and not only was not embarrassed, but, on the contrary, smiled maliciously and cheerfully, ""without the slightest remorse."" The most terrible noise arose; he was surrounded. Nikolai Vsyevolodovitch turned and looked about him, answering no one, and looking with curiosity at the exclaiming faces. Finally, he suddenly seemed to be thinking again—that’s how it was reported, at least—he frowned, firmly went up to the offended Pavel Pavlovich, and quickly muttered, with visible annoyance:","Suddenly our prince, for no apparent reason, perpetrated two or three gross outrages against various people, the important thing being, in other words, that these outrages were utterly without precedent, utterly unimaginable, utterly unlike anything usually done, utterly rotten and childish, and the Devil knows why, utterly without provocation. One of the most respected senior members of our club, Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov, a man well along in years and even honoured for his service, had adopted the innocent habit of accompanying his every word with a vehement ‘No, indeed, they won’t lead me by the nose!’ Well, there was nothing wrong with that. But on one occasion in the club, when during a heated discussion he uttered this phrase to a handful of club members that had clustered round him (and all of them people of some importance), Nikolay Vsevolodovich, who was standing by himself to one side and to whom no one was paying any attention, suddenly walked up to Pavel Pavlovich, seized him unexpectedly but firmly by the nose with two fingers, and managed to drag him two or three steps across the room. He couldn’t possibly have felt any animus towards Mr Gaganov. It might be thought of as just a schoolboy prank, of the most unforgivable kind, to be sure. And yet, as people subsequently described it, at the very moment of the operation, he was almost in a reverie, ‘as if he had lost his mind’; but that was recalled and reflected on only long afterwards. In the heat of things everyone at first remembered only the next moment, when he must have realized what had actually happened, and not only showed no embarrassment, but on the contrary, gave a malicious and happy smile, ‘without the slightest regret’. A truly dreadful din arose; people clustered round him. Nikolay Vsevolodovich kept turning and looking around, not replying to anyone and peering at the shouting people with curiosity. Finally, he suddenly seemed to become lost in thought once more — that, at least, is the way it was reported — gave a frown, marched resolutely up to the affronted Pavel Pavlovich and in evident annoyance, quickly muttered:","Our prince suddenly, for no reason at all, committed two or three impossibly brazen acts upon various persons-that is, the main thing lay in their being so unheard-of, so utterly unlike anything else, so different from what is usually done, so paltry and adolescent, and devil knows why, with no pretext whatsoever. One of the most respectable senior members of our club, Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov, an elderly man and even a decorated one, had acquired the innocent habit of accompanying his every word with a passionately uttered: ""No, sir, they won't lead me by the nose!"" And so what. But one day in the club, when he uttered this aphorism at some heated moment to a small group of club guests gathered around him (none of them inconsequential), Nikolai Vsevolodovich, who was standing apart by himself and whom no one was addressing, suddenly came up to Pavel Pavlovich, seized his nose unexpectedly but firmly with two fingers, and managed to pull him two or three steps across the room. He could not have felt any anger towards Mr. Gaganov. One might think it was merely a childish prank, a most unpardonable one, of course; yet it was recounted later that at the very moment of the operation he was almost in a reverie, ""just as if he had lost his mind""; but this was recalled and grasped long afterwards. At first, in the heat of the moment, everyone recalled only what happened next, by which time he certainly understood how things really were and not only did not become embarrassed but, on the contrary, smiled gaily and maliciously, ""without the least repentance. "" There was a terrible uproar; he was surrounded. Nikolai Vsevolodovich kept turning and looking around, not answering anyone, gazing with curiosity at the exclaiming faces. At last he seemed suddenly to lapse into reverie again- so they said, at least-frowned, stepped firmly up to the insulted Pavel Pavlovich, and with obvious vexation muttered rapidly:"

"Липутина арестовали уже в Петербурге, где он прожил целых две недели. С ним случилось почти невероятное дело, которое даже трудно и объяснить. Говорят, он имел и паспорт на чужое имя, и полную возможность успеть улизнуть за границу, и весьма значительные деньги с собой, а между тем остался в Петербурге и никуда не поехал.

Его и арестовали в Петербурге где-то в доме терпимости и нетрезвого. Носится слух, что теперь он вовсе не теряет духа, в показаниях своих лжет и готовится к предстоящему суду с некоторою торжественностью и надеждою. Он намерен даже поговорить на суде. Толкаченко, арестованный где-то в уезде, дней десять спустя после своего бегства, ведет себя несравненно учтивее, не лжет, не виляет, говорит всё, что знает, себя не оправдывает, винится со всею скромностию, но тоже наклонен покраснобайничать; много и с охотою говорит, а когда дело дойдет до знания народа и революционных его элементов, то даже позирует и жаждет эффекта.

"Мы с ним, может быть, и преувеличивали. Во-первых, Петр Степанович перезнакомился почти мгновенно со всем городом, в первые же четыре дня после своего появления. Появился он в воскресенье, а во вторник я уже встретил его в коляске с Артемием Павловичем Гагановым, человеком гордым, раздражительным и заносчивым, несмотря на всю его светскость, и с которым, по характеру его, довольно трудно было ужиться. У губернатора Петр Степанович был тоже принят прекрасно, до того, что тотчас же стал в положение близкого или, так сказать, обласканного молодого человека; обедал у Юлии Михайловны почти ежедневно. Познакомился он с нею еще в Швейцарии, но в быстром успехе его в доме его превосходительства действительно заключалось нечто любопытное. Все-таки он слыл же когда-то заграничным революционером, правда ли, нет ли, участвовал в каких-то заграничных изданиях и конгрессах, «что можно даже из газет доказать», как злобно выразился мне при встрече Алеша Телятников, теперь, увы, отставной чиновничек, а прежде тоже обласканный молодой человек в доме старого губернатора. Но тут стоял, однако же, факт: бывший революционер явился в любезном отечестве не только без всякого беспокойства, но чуть ли не с поощрениями; стало быть, ничего, может, и не было. Липутин шепнул мне раз, что, по слухам, Петр Степанович будто бы где-то принес покаяние и получил отпущение, назвав несколько прочих имен, и таким образом, может, и успел уже заслужить вину, обещая и впредь быть полезным отечеству. Я передал эту ядовитую фразу Степану Трофимовичу, и тот, несмотря на то, что был почти не в состоянии соображать, сильно задумался. Впоследствии обнаружилось, что Петр Степанович приехал к нам с чрезвычайно почтенными рекомендательными письмами, по крайней мере привез одно к губернаторше от одной чрезвычайно важной петербургской старушки, муж которой был одним из самых значительных петербургских старичков. Эта старушка, крестная мать Юлии Михайловны, упоминала в письме своем, что и граф К. хорошо знает Петра Степановича, чрез Николая Всеволодовича, обласкал его и находит «достойным молодым человеком, несмотря на бывшие заблуждения». Юлия Михайловна до крайности ценила свои скудные и с таким трудом поддерживаемые связи с «высшим миром» и, уж конечно, была рада письму важной старушки; но все-таки оставалось тут нечто как бы и особенное. Даже супруга своего поставила к Петру Степановичу в отношения почти фамилиарные, так что господин фон Лембке жаловался… но об этом тоже после. Замечу тоже для памяти, что и великий писатель весьма благосклонно отнесся к Петру Степановичу и тотчас же пригласил его к себе. Такая поспешность такого надутого собою человека кольнула Степана Трофимовича больнее всего; но я объяснил себе иначе: зазывая к себе нигилиста, господин Кармазинов, уж конечно, имел в виду сношения его с прогрессивными юношами обеих столиц. Великий писатель болезненно трепетал пред новейшею революционною молодежью и, воображая, по незнанию дела, что в руках ее ключи русской будущности, унизительно к ним подлизывался, главное потому, что они не обращали на него никакого внимания.","We may have exaggerated. Firstly, Pyotr Stepanovich became acquainted almost instantly with the whole city, in the very first four days after his appearance. He appeared on Sunday, and on Tuesday I already met him in a carriage with Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov, a proud, irritable and arrogant man, in spite of all his secularism, and with whom, by his nature, it was rather difficult to get along. Pyotr Stepanovich was also well received by the governor, so much so that he immediately became in the position of a close or, so to speak, kindly young man; I dined with Yulia Mikhailovna almost every day. He had met her while still in Switzerland, but there really was something curious about his rapid success at his Excellency's house. All the same, he was once known as a revolutionary abroad, is it true, is it true, did he participate in some foreign publications and congresses, “which can be proved even from newspapers,” as Alyosha Telyatnikov angrily put it to me when we met, now, alas, a retired clerk, and formerly also a kindly young man in the old governor's house. But here stood, however, the fact: the former revolutionary appeared in his beloved fatherland not only without any anxiety, but almost with encouragement; so, maybe nothing happened. Liputin whispered to me once that, according to rumors, Pyotr Stepanovich allegedly repented somewhere and received a pardon, naming several other names, and in this way, perhaps, he had already managed to earn the blame, promising to continue to be useful to the fatherland. I conveyed this venomous phrase to Stepan Trofimovich, and he, despite the fact that he was almost unable to think, fell into deep thought. Subsequently, it turned out that Pyotr Stepanovich came to us with extremely respectable letters of recommendation, at least he brought one to the governor's wife from an extremely important Petersburg old woman, whose husband was one of the most significant Petersburg old men. This old woman, the godmother of Yulia Mikhailovna, mentioned in her letter that Count K. knew Pyotr Stepanovich well, through Nikolai Vsevolodovich, caressed him and found him ""a worthy young man, despite his former delusions."" Yulia Mikhailovna extremely valued her meager and with such difficulty maintained ties with the ""higher world"" and, of course, was glad to receive a letter from an important old woman; but still there remained something, as it were, special. Even her wife placed her in an almost familiar relationship with Pyotr Stepanovich, so Herr von Lembke complained ... but more on that later. I also note for memory that the great writer treated Pyotr Stepanovich very favorably and immediately invited him to his place. Such haste with such a puffed-up man struck Stepan Trofimovich most painfully; but I explained to myself differently: in inviting the nihilist to him, Mr. Karmazinov, of course, had in mind his relations with the progressive youths of both capitals. The great writer trembled painfully before the latest revolutionary youth and, imagining, out of ignorance of the matter, that the keys of the Russian future were in their hands, humiliatingly fawned over them, mainly because they did not pay any attention to him.","Perhaps he and I were exaggerating. In the first place, Pyotr Stepanovich renewed his acquaintance with virtually the entire town almost immediately in the first four days after his arrival. He had appeared on a Sunday, and as early as Tuesday I encountered him sitting in a carriage with Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov, a proud man, cantankerous and haughty, despite all his sophistication, whose character made him difficult to get along with. Pyotr Stepanovich was also hospitably received at the governor’s, so much so that he immediately found himself in the position of an intimate, or, so to speak, a favoured young man. He dined with Yuliya Mikhaylovna almost every day. He had made her acquaintance while they were in Switzerland, but there was actually something curious about his rapid success in His Excellency’s house. After all, he did have the reputation of having once been a revolutionary while abroad, whether true or not, of having participated in some foreign publications and congresses, ‘proof of which could be found even in the newspapers’, as I was maliciously informed on one occasion by Alyosha Telyatnikov, who is now, alas, a retired clerk, but previously had also been a favoured young man in the house of the former governor. Still and all, this was the plain fact: the former revolutionary had appeared in his beloved fatherland not only without any trouble, but almost with encouragement; therefore, there was probably nothing in it. Liputin had once whispered to me that according to rumour, Pyotr Stepanovich had supposedly repented and received absolution, after providing several other names, and had therefore perhaps now atoned for his guilt by promising to be useful to the fatherland in the future as well. I communicated this venomous remark to Stepan Trofimovich, who, despite being in really no condition to reflect on anything, fell to brooding. Subsequently it emerged that Pyotr Stepanovich had come here with extremely respectable letters of recommendation; at least, he had brought one to the governor’s wife from a certain extremely important old lady in Petersburg, whose husband was one of the most distinguished old gentlemen in Petersburg. This old lady, Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s godmother, mentioned in her letter that Count K. also knew Pyotr Stepanovich well, through Nikolay Vsevolodovich, treated him with kindness and found him ‘a worthy young man, despite his past derelictions’. Yuliya Mikhaylovna set a very high value on her tenuous connections with ‘the higher society’, which she maintained with such difficulty, and, needless to say, she was happy to receive the letter from the important old woman; yet there was still something rather strange about the whole thing. She even put her husband on an almost familiar footing with Pyotr Stepanovich, which elicited complaints from Mr von Lembke… but more about that later as well. I will also note for the record that even the great writer himself was very favourably disposed towards Pyotr Stepanovich and immediately invited him to his house. Such haste on the part of a man who was so puffed up about himself cut Stepan Trofimovich to the quick more painfully than anything else; but I had a different explanation for it: by pressing a nihilist to visit him, Mr Karmazinov quite obviously had in mind his relations with the progressive young people of both capitals. The great writer was mortally afraid of the rising generation of young revolutionaries, and imagining, through his ignorance of things, that they held the keys to Russia’s future, sucked up to them shamelessly, mainly because they paid absolutely no attention to him.","Perhaps we were both exaggerating. First of all, Pyotr Stepanovich became acquainted with the whole town almost instantly, in the first four days after his appearance. He appeared on Sunday, and already on Tuesday I met him in a carriage with Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov, a proud man, irritable and overbearing, despite all his worldly polish, and with whom, owing to his character, it was quite difficult to get along. Pyotr Stepanovich was also very well received at the governor's, so much so that he stepped at once into the position of an intimate or, so to speak, a much favored young man; he dined at Yulia Mikhailovna's almost daily. He had already made her acquaintance in Switzerland, but there was indeed something curious about his rapid success in His Excellency's house. After all, whether it was true or not, he was once reputed to have been a foreign revolutionary, to have participated in some foreign publications and conferences, ""which can even be proved from the newspapers,"" as it was spitefully put in my presence by Alyosha Telyatnikov, now, alas, a retired petty official, but formerly also a much favored young man in the old governor's house. Still, the fact remained that the former revolutionary appeared in his beloved fatherland not only without any trouble, but almost with inducements; so perhaps there was nothing to it. Liputin once whispered to me that, according to rumors, Pyotr Stepanovich had supposedly made his repentance somewhere, and had received absolution, after disclosing a few other names, and had thus perhaps already managed to make good his guilt, also promising to be useful in future to the fatherland. I conveyed this venomous remark to Stepan Trofimovich, and he, though he was almost incapable of reflection, lapsed into deep thought. Later on it was disclosed that Pyotr Stepanovich had come to us with extremely respectable letters of recommendation, at least he had brought one to the governor's wife from an extremely important little old lady of Petersburg, whose husband was one of the most distinguished little old men of Petersburg. This little old lady, Yulia Mikhailovna's godmother, mentioned in her letter that Count K. also knew Pyotr Stepanovich quite well through Nikolai Vsevolodovich, had shown him favor, and found him ""a worthy young man, in spite of his former errors."" Yulia Mikhailovna valued exceedingly her scant and so difficultly maintained connections with the ""high world,"" and was of course very glad of the important little old lady's letter; but there still remained something peculiar here, as it were. She even put her husband into almost familiar relations with Pyotr Stepanovich, which caused Mr. von Lembke to complain... but of that, too, later. I will observe, too, so as not to forget, that the great writer also treated Pyotr Stepanovich quite benignly and immediately invited him to visit. Such haste on the part of such a self-inflated man stung Stepan Trofimovich most painfully, but I explained it to myself otherwise: in courting a nihilist,2 Mr. Karmazinov most certainly had in mind his relations with the progressive young men of both capitals. The great writer trembled morbidly before the newest revolutionary young men, and, imagining in his ignorance of the matter that the keys to the Russian future were in their hands, sucked up to them humiliatingly, the more so since they paid no attention at all to him."

"Все мы молчали и ждали какой-нибудь развязки. Шатов не поднимал головы, а Степан Трофимович был в смятении, как будто во всем виноватый; пот выступил на его висках.

Варвара Петровна видела эту улыбку. А между тем Марья Тимофеевна увлеклась совершенно: она с наслаждением и нимало не конфузясь рассматривала прекрасную гостиную Варвары Петровны – меблировку, ковры, картины на стенах, старинный расписной потолок, большое бронзовое распятие в углу, фарфоровую лампу, альбомы, вещицы на столе.","We all remained silent and waited for some kind of denouement.

"К утру у Варвары Петровны созрел проект разом покончить по крайней мере хоть с одним недоумением – проект замечательный по своей неожиданности. Что было в сердце ее, когда она создала его? – трудно решить, да и не возьмусь я растолковывать заранее все противоречия, из которых он состоял. Как хроникер, я ограничиваюсь лишь тем, что представляю события в точном виде, точно так, как они произошли, и не виноват, если они покажутся невероятными. Но, однако, должен еще раз засвидетельствовать, что подозрений на Дашу у ней к утру никаких не осталось, а по правде, никогда и не начиналось; слишком она была в ней уверена. Да и мысли она не могла допустить, чтоб ее Nicolas мог увлечься ее… «Дарьей».

"Я уже намекал о том, что у нас появились разные людишки. В смутное время колебания или перехода всегда и везде появляются разные людишки. Я не про тех так называемых «передовых» говорю, которые всегда спешат прежде всех (главная забота) и хотя очень часто с глупейшею, но всё же с определенною более или менее целью. Нет, я говорю лишь про сволочь. Во всякое переходное время подымается эта сволочь, которая есть в каждом обществе, и уже не только безо всякой цели, но даже не имея и признака мысли, а лишь выражая собою изо всех сил беспокойство и нетерпение. Между тем эта сволочь, сама не зная того, почти всегда подпадает под команду той малой кучки «передовых», которые действуют с определенною целью, и та направляет весь этот сор куда ей угодно, если только сама не состоит из совершенных идиотов, что, впрочем, тоже случается. У нас вот говорят теперь, когда уже всё прошло, что Петром Степановичем управляла Интернационалка, а Петр Степанович Юлией Михайловной, а та уже регулировала по его команде всякую сволочь. Солиднейшие из наших умов дивятся теперь на себя: как это они тогда вдруг оплошали? В чем состояло наше смутное время и от чего к чему был у нас переход – я не знаю, да и никто, я думаю, не знает – разве вот некоторые посторонние гости. А между тем дряннейшие людишки получили вдруг перевес, стали громко критиковать всё священное, тогда как прежде и рта не смели раскрыть, а первейшие люди, до тех пор так благополучно державшие верх, стали вдруг их слушать, а сами молчать; а иные так позорнейшим образом подхихикивать. Какие-то Лямшины, Телятниковы, помещики Тентетниковы, доморощенные сопляки Радищевы, скорбно, но надменно улыбающиеся жидишки, хохотуны заезжие путешественники, поэты с направлением из столицы, поэты взамен направления и таланта в поддевках и смазных сапогах, майоры и полковники, смеющиеся над бессмысленностию своего звания и за лишний рубль готовые тотчас же снять свою шпагу и улизнуть в писаря на железную дорогу; генералы, перебежавшие в адвокаты; развитые посредники, развивающиеся купчики, бесчисленные семинаристы, женщины, изображающие собою женский вопрос, – всё это вдруг у нас взяло полный верх, и над кем же? Над клубом, над почтенными сановниками, над генералами на деревянных ногах, над строжайшим и неприступнейшим нашим дамским обществом. Уж если Варвара Петровна, до самой катастрофы с ее сынком, состояла чуть не на посылках у всей этой сволочи, то другим из наших Минерв отчасти и простительна их тогдашняя одурь. Теперь всё приписывают, как я уже и сказал, Интернационалке. Идея эта до того укрепилась, что в этом смысле доносят даже наехавшим посторонним. Еще недавно советник Кубриков, шестидесяти двух лет и со Станиславом на шее, пришел безо всякого зову и проникнутым голосом объявил, что в продолжение целых трех месяцев несомненно состоял под влиянием Интернационалки. Когда же, со всем уважением к его летам и заслугам, пригласили его объясниться удовлетворительнее, то он хотя и не мог представить никаких документов, кроме того, что «ощущал всеми своими чувствами», но тем не менее твердо остался при своем заявлении, так что его уже более не допрашивали.","I have already hinted that we have different little people. In troubled times of hesitation or transition, different little people always and everywhere appear. I'm not talking about those so-called ""advanced"" ones who are always in a hurry first of all (the main concern), and although very often with the most stupid, but still with a more or less definite goal. No, I'm just talking about the bastard. At every transitional time, this bastard rises up, which exists in every society, and not only without any purpose, but without even a sign of thought, but only expressing anxiety and impatience with all his might. Meanwhile, this bastard, without knowing it himself, almost always falls under the command of that small bunch of ""advanced"" who act with a specific goal, and she directs all this rubbish wherever she wants, unless she herself consists of complete idiots, which, by the way also happens. We are now saying, when everything has already passed, that Pyotr Stepanovich was controlled by the International, and Pyotr Stepanovich by Yulia Mikhailovna, and she already regulated all kinds of bastards at his command. The most solid of our minds are now amazed at themselves: how did they suddenly blunder then? What our time of troubles consisted of and from what to what we had a transition - I do not know, and I think no one knows - except for some outside guests. And meanwhile the wretched little people suddenly gained the upper hand, began to loudly criticize everything sacred, whereas before they did not even dare to open their mouths, and the first people, who until then had so successfully held the upper hand, suddenly began to listen to them, while themselves were silent; while others giggle in the most shameful way. Some Lyamshins, Telyatnikovs, landowners Tentetnikovs, homegrown brats Radishchevs, sadly but arrogantly smiling Jews, visiting travelers with laughter, poets with directions from the capital, poets instead of direction and talent in undershirts and oily boots, majors and colonels laughing at the senselessness of their ranks and for an extra ruble, ready to immediately take off their sword and slip away into a clerk on the railroad; generals who defected to lawyers; developed intermediaries, developing merchants, innumerable seminarians, women representing the women's question - all this suddenly took over from us completely, and over whom? Above the club, above respectable dignitaries, above the generals on wooden legs, above our strictest and most impregnable society of ladies. Well, if Varvara Petrovna, until the very catastrophe with her son, was almost on parcels from all this bastards, then the other of our Minervas is partly forgiven for their then stupidity. Now everything is attributed, as I already said, to the International. This idea has become so strong that in this sense even strangers come across. Until recently, the adviser Kubrikov, sixty-two years old and with Stanislav around his neck, came without any call and announced in an imbued voice that for three whole months he had undoubtedly been under the influence of the International. When, with all respect for his years and merits, they invited him to explain himself more satisfactorily, although he could not present any documents, except for what he ""felt with all his feelings,"" nevertheless he firmly remained with his statement, so that he was no longer interrogated.","I’ve already mentioned that various low types of people had appeared among us. In troubled times, times of uncertainty or transition, various low types of people always and everywhere appear. I’m not talking about those so-called ‘advanced’ people who are always rushing ahead of everyone else (their main concern), albeit very often with a purpose that’s extremely stupid, but is nonetheless more or less definite. No, I’m talking here only about the riff-raff. The riff-raff that exists in every society rises to the surface in any time of transition, and is utterly devoid not only of any goal, but even the slightest indication of an idea, and merely gives expression to restlessness and impatience as forcefully as it can. Meanwhile, the riff-raff, without being aware of it, almost always falls under the sway of that small band of ‘advanced people’ which acts with a definite goal, and which points all this rabble in whatever direction they please, provided that they in turn don’t consist of utter idiots as well, which, however, also happens. Now that everything is over, people in our town are saying that Pyotr Stepanovich was controlled by the Internationale, and that Pyotr Stepanovich controlled Yuliya Mikhaylovna, who in turn directed, at his command, all manner of riff-raff. The more sensible of our intellects are amazed at themselves now: how could they have suddenly made such a blunder then? What our time of troubles consisted of, and what we were making a transition from and to, I don’t know, and no one else knows, I think, except perhaps for certain of our visitors from outside. And meantime, the lowest of low types suddenly gained predominance, and began loudly criticizing all that was sacred, whereas previously they hadn’t dared open their mouths, and the leading people, who until then had blithely had the final say, suddenly began listening to them while keeping quiet themselves, and some began tittering in a most disgraceful manner. Certain Lyamshins, Telyatnikovs, landowner Tentetnikovs,1 home-grown snivelling Radishchevs, nasty little Jews with mournful but arrogant smiles, guffawing travellers just passing through, poets from the capital with political agendas, poets in peasant coats and tarred boots instead of an agenda and talent, majors and colonels who made fun of the foolishness of their profession and who, for an extra rouble, were ready then and there to unbuckle their swords and slip off to become railway clerks; generals scuttled away into the ranks of the lawyers; intellectually developed mediators and petty merchants who were still developing; countless seminary students, women who embodied the woman question — all these suddenly got the upper hand in our town, and over whom, I may ask? Over the club, over the respected elder statesmen, over the generals on wooden legs, over the very severe and very unapproachable ladies of our society. If Varvara Petrovna, right up to the catastrophe involving her own dear son, was practically running errands for all this riff-raff, then other Minervas2 among us can be partially forgiven for their state of stupefaction at the time. Now people, as I’ve already said, are ascribing everything to the Internationale. This notion has become so firmly lodged that it is even reported to visiting outsiders. Not too long ago Councillor Kubrikov, a man of sixty-two and wearing the Order of St Stanislav3 around his neck, came forward quite voluntarily and announced in an emotional voice that for three whole months he had undoubtedly been under the influence of the Internationale. But when, with all due respect for his years and his services, he was invited to provide a more satisfactory explanation, he was utterly unable to produce any evidence beyond saying that ‘he had felt it with all his senses’, but nonetheless stood firmly by his statement, so that he was no longer questioned.","I have already hinted at the fact that various trashy sorts of people had appeared among us. Always and everywhere, in a troubled time of hesitation or transition, various trashy sorts appear. I am not speaking of the so-called ""vanguard,"" who always rush ahead of everyone else (their chief concern) and whose goal, though very often quite stupid, is still more or less definite. No, I am speaking only of scum. This scum, which exists in every society, rises to the surface in any transitional time, and not only has no goal, but has not even the inkling of an idea, and itself merely expresses anxiety and impatience with all its might. And yet this scum, without knowing it, almost always falls under the command of that small group of the ""vanguard"" which acts with a definite goal, and which directs all this rabble wherever it pleases, provided it does not consist of perfect idiots itself-which, incidentally, also happens. It is said among us now, when everything is already over, that Pyotr Stepanovich was controlled by the Internationale,1 that Pyotr Stepanovich controlled Yulia Mikhailovna, and that she, at his command, directed all sorts of scum. Our most solid minds are now marveling at themselves: how could they suddenly have gone so amiss then? What our troubled time consisted of, and from what to what our transition was-I do not know, and no one, I think, knows-except perhaps certain visitors from outside. And yet the trashiest people suddenly gained predominance and began loudly criticizing all that's holy, whereas earlier they had not dared to open their mouths, and the foremost people, who until then had so happily kept the upper hand, suddenly began listening to them, and became silent themselves; and some even chuckled along in a most disgraceful way. Some sort of Lyamshins, Telyatnikovs, landowner Tentetnikovs, homegrown milksop Radishchevs,2 little Jews with mournful but haughty smiles, jolly passing travelers, poets with a tendency from the capital, poets who in place of a tendency and talent had peasant coats and tarred boots, majors and colonels who laughed at the meaninglessness of their rank and were ready, for an extra rouble, to take off their swords at once and slink away to become railroad clerks; generals defecting to the lawyers; developed dealers, developing little merchants, countless seminarians, women who embodied in themselves the woman question-all this suddenly and fully gained the upper hand among us, and over whom? Over the club, over venerable dignitaries, over generals on wooden legs, over our most strict and inaccessible ladies' society. If even Varvara Petrovna, right up to the catastrophe with her boy, was all but running errands for all this scum, then some of our Minervas can be partially forgiven for their befuddlement at the time. Now everything is imputed, as I have already said, to the Internationale. The idea has grown so strong that even all the visiting outsiders have been informed along these lines. Just recently Councillor Kubrikov, sixty-two years old and with a Stanislav round his neck,3 came without any summons and declared in a heartfelt voice that during the whole three months he had undoubtedly been under the influence of the Internationale. And when, with all due respect for his age and merits, he was asked to explain himself more satisfactorily, though unable to present any documents except that he ""felt it with all his senses,"" he nevertheless stuck firmly to his declaration, so that he was not questioned further."

"Я между тем наскоро рассматривал гостя. Это был еще молодой человек, лет около двадцати семи, прилично одетый, стройный и сухощавый брюнет, с бледным, несколько грязноватого оттенка лицом и с черными глазами без блеску. Он казался несколько задумчивым и рассеянным, говорил отрывисто и как-то не грамматически, как-то странно переставлял слова и путался, если приходилось составить фразу подлиннее. Липутин совершенно заметил чрезвычайный испуг Степана Трофимовича и видимо был доволен. Он уселся на плетеном стуле, который вытащил чуть не на средину комнаты, чтобы находиться в одинаковом расстоянии между хозяином и гостем, разместившимися один против другого на двух противоположных диванах. Вострые глаза его с любопытством шныряли по всем углам.","Meanwhile, I quickly examined the guest. He was still a young man, about twenty-seven years old, decently dressed, slender and lean, dark-haired, with a pale, somewhat dirty face and black eyes without a gleam. He seemed somewhat thoughtful and distracted, spoke abruptly and somehow not grammatically, somehow rearranged words in a strange way and got confused if he had to compose a sentence more authentically. Liputin completely noticed Stepan Trofimovich's extreme fright and was evidently pleased. He sat down on a wicker chair, which he pulled out almost to the middle of the room so that he could be at the same distance between the host and the guest, who were seated opposite each other on two opposite sofas. His sharp eyes darted around curiously.","Meanwhile I was giving the visitor a quick once-over.

Эх, Степан Трофимович, хорошо вам кричать, что сплетни да шпионство, и заметьте, когда уже сами от меня всё выпытали, да еще с таким чрезмерным любопытством. А вот Варвара Петровна, так та прямо вчера в самую точку: «Вы, говорит, лично заинтересованы были в деле, потому к вам и обращаюсь». Да еще же бы нет-с! Какие уж тут цели, когда я личную обиду при всем обществе от его превосходительства скушал! Кажется, имею причины и не для одних сплетен поинтересоваться. Сегодня жмет вам руку, а завтра ни с того ни с сего, за хлеб-соль вашу, вас же бьет по щекам при всем честном обществе, как только ему полюбится. С жиру-с!

А вот женились бы, так как вы и теперь еще такой молодец из себя, на хорошенькой да на молоденькой, так, пожалуй, от нашего принца двери крючком заложите да баррикады в своем же доме выстроите!

Eh, Stepan Trofimovich, it's good for you to shout that gossip and espionage, and notice that they themselves have already extorted everything from me, and even with such excessive curiosity. And here is Varvara Petrovna, right on the spot yesterday: “You, he says, were personally interested in the case, that’s why I’m turning to you.” Yes, still no, sir! What are the goals here, when I ate a personal insult in front of the whole society from His Excellency! It seems that I have reasons and not just for gossip to ask. Today he shakes your hand, and tomorrow, for no apparent reason, for your bread and salt, he hits you on the cheeks with all honest society, as soon as he likes it. With fat! And most importantly, they are female: moths and brave cockerels! Landowners with wings, like those of ancient cupids, Pechorins-heartthrobs! It’s good for you, Stepan Trofimovich, an inveterate bachelor, to speak like that and call me a gossip for His Excellency. But if you would marry, since you are still such a fine fellow of yourself, to a pretty and young one, then, perhaps, from our prince, lay the door with a hook and build barricades in your own house! Why, if only this Mademoiselle Lebyadkina, who is being whipped with whips, was not crazy and not bow-legged, by God, I would have thought that she was the victim of our general’s passions and that Captain Lebyadkin suffered from this very thing ""in his family dignity,"" as he himself puts it. Only if it contradicts their elegant taste, and even then it doesn’t matter to them. Every berry is used, only to fall under their well-known mood. You're talking about gossip, but am I screaming when the whole city is already knocking, and I'm just listening and assenting; assent is not forbidden, sir.","‘Why, what are you picking on me for?

Lebyadkin also said the very same thing: “I’ve suffered from his character,” he says. Ah, Stepan Trofimovich, it’s all very well for you to shout about gossip and spying, but observe that it’s after you’ve squeezed everything out of me, and with such an excess of curiosity besides. But take Varvara Petrovna, she just went straight to the point yesterday: “You,” she says, “had a personal interest in the matter, and that is why I am turning to you.” Well, it would be surprising if she didn’t, sir! Why wonder about motives here, when I swallowed a personal insult from His Excellency in front of our local society! I would seem to have good reason to be interested, and not just for the sake of gossip. Today he shakes your hand, but the next day, out of the blue, he rewards your hospitality by slapping you on both cheeks in front of a whole gathering of honest people, just because he feels like it. It comes from having it too good, sir! For these people the main thing is the female sex: butterflies and strutting little cocks of the walk! Landowners with delicate little wings, like the ones on ancient cupids, lady-killing Pechorins!19 It’s all very well for you, Stepan Trofimovich, as a confirmed bachelor, to talk this way and to call me a gossip because of His Excellency. But if you were to get married, since you’re still such a fine figure of a man even now, to someone who’s both pretty and young, then you’d most probably lock and bolt the door against our prince and set up barricades in your own house! Well, never mind. Take this Mademoiselle Lebyadkina, the one who’s being beaten with whips, if only she weren’t crazy and bowlegged, then I swear, I’d think she’s the one who’s the victim of our young general’s passions, and that it was from him that Captain Lebyadkin suffered “in his family dignity”, to use his own expression. Except maybe that’s contrary to his refined taste, but to people like him that doesn’t matter. Any little berry is worth the picking, so long as it’s there when he’s in a particular mood. Here you are talking about gossip, but there’s no need for me to shout about it when the whole town is chattering away, and I’m just listening and nodding in agreement. There’s no law against nodding in agreement, sir.’","""And how do I deserve this, sir? I am the first one to shout that he's a man of the most refined and elegant mind, and I set Varvara Petrovna completely at ease yesterday in that regard.

Ah, Stepan Trofimovich, it's fine for you to shout about gossiping and spying, and that, notice, when you yourself have already extorted everything from me, and with such exceeding curiosity besides. And Varvara Petrovna, she really put her finger on it yesterday: 'You had a personal interest in the matter,' she says, 'that's why I'm turning to you.' And what else, sir! Why talk about purposes, when I swallowed a personal offense from His Excellency in front of a whole gathering! It would seem I have reasons to be interested, not just for the sake of gossip. Today he shakes your hand, and tomorrow, for no reason at all, to repay your hospitality, he slaps your face in front of a whole honorable gathering, the moment he pleases. From fat living, sir!

Only maybe it contradicts his refined taste, but that's no great trouble to him. Any berry will do, so long as it comes his way while he's in a certain mood.

"– Ни России, ни народа! – завопил и Шатов, сверкая глазами. – Нельзя любить то, чего не знаешь, а они ничего в русском народе не смыслили! Все они, и вы вместе с ними, просмотрели русский народ сквозь пальцы, а Белинский особенно; уж из того самого письма его к Гоголю это видно. Белинский, точь-в-точь как Крылова Любопытный, не приметил слона в кунсткамере, а всё внимание свое устремил на французских социальных букашек; так и покончил на них. А ведь он еще, пожалуй, всех вас умнее был! Вы мало того что просмотрели народ, – вы с омерзительным презрением к нему относились, уж по тому одному, что под народом вы воображали себе один только французский народ, да и то одних парижан, и стыдились, что русский народ не таков. И это голая правда! А у кого нет народа, у того нет и бога! Знайте наверно, что все те, которые перестают понимать свой народ и теряют с ним свои связи, тотчас же, по мере того, теряют и веру отеческую, становятся или атеистами, или равнодушными. Верно говорю! Это факт, который оправдается. Вот почему и вы все и мы все теперь – или гнусные атеисты, или равнодушная, развратная дрянь, и ничего больше! И вы тоже, Степан Трофимович, я вас нисколько не исключаю, даже на ваш счет и говорил, знайте это!","- Neither Russia, nor the people! yelled Shatov, his eyes flashing. - You can’t love what you don’t know, and they didn’t understand anything about the Russian people! All of them, and you along with them, looked through the fingers of the Russian people, and especially Belinsky; this is clear from that very letter of his to Gogol. Belinsky, just like Krylova Curious, did not notice the elephant in the cabinet of curiosities, but directed all his attention to the French social insects; and ended up with them. But he was probably smarter than all of you! You not only overlooked the people, but you treated them with disgusting contempt, for the sole reason that under the people you imagined only the French people, and even then only Parisians, and were ashamed that the Russian people were not like that. And this is the naked truth! And whoever does not have a people, he does not have a god! Know for sure that all those who cease to understand their people and lose their ties with them, immediately, as they grow, lose their paternal faith, become either atheists or indifferent. I speak true! This is a fact that is justified. That is why all of you and all of us now are either vile atheists, or indifferent, depraved rubbish, and nothing more! And you, too, Stepan Trofimovich, I do not exclude you in the least, I even spoke at your expense, know this!","‘Neither Russia nor the people!’ Shatov also began to shriek, his eyes flashing. ‘It’s impossible to love what you don’t know, and they had no understanding of the Russian people! All of them, including you, turned a blind eye to the Russian people, and especially Belinsky: it’s obvious from that very letter to Gogol. Belinsky, precisely like the inquisitive man in Krylov’s fable, didn’t notice the elephant in the museum of curiosities, but focused all his attention on the French social insects, and simply never went any further than that.71 And yet he was perhaps even more intelligent than all of you! It’s not enough that you overlooked the people — you treated them with sickening contempt, for the sole reason that you couldn’t imagine “the people” to be anything other than the French people, and only Parisians at that, and you were ashamed that the Russian people weren’t like that. That’s the unvarnished truth! And anyone who has no people has no God either! You can be quite sure that all who cease to understand their own people and lose their ties with them, immediately and to the same extent, also lose the faith of their fathers, and either become atheists or indifferent. I’m telling the truth! This is a fact that will be corroborated. That’s why all of you and all of us now are either vile atheists or indifferent, depraved rubbish, and nothing more! And you too, Stepan Trofimovich, I’m not making the slightest exception for you , I was even saying it on your account, you should know that!’","""Neither Russia nor the people!"" Shatov also yelled, flashing his eyes. ""One cannot love what one does not know, and they understood nothing about the Russian people!

You may be sure that all those who cease to understand their people and lose their connection with them, at once, in the same measure, also lose the faith of their fathers, and become either atheists or indifferent.

"Напомню опять читателю, что Николай Всеволодович принадлежал к тем натурам, которые страха не ведают.

Если бы кто ударил его по щеке, то, как мне кажется, он бы и на дуэль не вызвал, а тут же, тотчас же убил бы обидчика; он именно был из таких, и убил бы с полным сознанием, а вовсе не вне себя. Мне кажется даже, что он никогда и не знал тех ослепляющих порывов гнева, при которых уже нельзя рассуждать. При бесконечной злобе, овладевавшей им иногда, он все-таки всегда мог сохранять полную власть над собой, а стало быть, и понимать, что за убийство не на дуэли его непременно сошлют в каторгу; тем не менее он все-таки убил бы обидчика, и без малейшего колебания.","Let me remind the reader again that Nikolai Vsevolodovich belonged to those natures who know no fear. In a duel, he could stand under the enemy’s shot in cold blood, he himself would aim and kill to the point of brutality calmly. If someone hit him on the cheek, then, it seems to me, he would not have challenged him to a duel, but right there, immediately would have killed the offender; he was precisely one of those, and would have killed with full consciousness, and not at all beside himself. It even seems to me that he never knew those blinding outbursts of anger, in which it is no longer possible to reason. With the endless malice that sometimes took possession of him, he could nevertheless always retain complete power over himself, and, therefore, understand that for a murder not in a duel he would certainly be sent to hard labor; nevertheless, he would still kill the offender, and without the slightest hesitation.","I will again remind the reader that Nikolay Vsevolodovich had the kind of constitution that knew no fear. In a duel he was able to stand cold-bloodedly facing his opponent’s shot, then take aim himself and kill him with all the calmness of a beast. If someone had hit him on the cheek, then, or so it seems to me, he wouldn’t even have challenged him to a duel, but would have killed the offender right on the spot, without further ado. That was the sort of person he was, and he would have killed with full awareness of what he was doing, and not because he had lost control of himself. It even seems to me that he had never known any of those blinding surges of anger that make rational thought impossible. Even when overcome with boundless rage, as was sometimes the case, he could still maintain full control of himself, and therefore also understand that for a murder not committed during a duel, he would be sentenced to hard labour. Nevertheless, he would still have killed the person who had insulted him, and without the slightest hesitation.","I will remind the reader once more that Nikolai Vsevolodovich was one of those natures that knows no fear. In a duel he would stand cold-bloodedly before his adversary's fire, take aim himself, and kill with brutal calm. If anyone had slapped him in the face then, I think he would not even have challenged the offender to a duel, but would have killed him at once, on the spot; he was precisely that sort, and would kill with full awareness and not at all in rage. I even think that he never knew those blinding fits of wrath that make one unable to reason. For all the boundless anger that would occasionally take possession of him, he was always able to preserve complete self-control, and therefore to realize that for killing someone otherwise than in a duel he would certainly be sent to hard labor; nevertheless, he would still have killed the offender, and that without the slightest hesitation."

Forgive the old gout, I go to bed early, and I would advise you to go ""sleeping"", as they say aux enfants.[210] But I came for the young beauties… whom, of course, I can’t meet anywhere in such a rich set, except for this place… It’s all because of the river, but I don’t go there. The wife of an officer ... it seems, a Jaeger ... is very good-looking, very and ... and she knows it herself. I talked to the rogue; lively and ... well, the girls are also fresh; but only; Nothing but freshness. However, I'm happy to. There are buds; only the lips are thick. In general, in the Russian beauty of women's faces, there is little of that correctness and ... and it comes down to a pancake ... Vous me pardonnerez, n'est-ce pas [211] ... with good, however, eyes ... laughing eyes. These buds of the year two of their youth are o-charming, even three ... well, there they blur forever ... producing in their husbands that sad in-differentism that so contributes to the development of the women's question ... if only I am correct I understand this question ... Hm. The hall is good; the rooms are not badly cleaned. Could be worse. The music could have been much worse… I don't say it should be. The bad effect is that there are few ladies at all. About the outfits, I don’t know. It's bad that this one in gray trousers so frankly allows himself to go on and on. I will forgive him if he is happy and since he is the local pharmacist ... but at the eleventh hour it is still too early for the pharmacist ... There, in the buffet, two people had a fight and were not taken out. At the eleventh hour, the fighters must still be brought out, whatever the morals of the public ... I don’t say at the third hour, here a concession to public opinion is already necessary - and if only this ball survives until the third hour. Varvara Petrovna, however, did not keep her word and did not give flowers. Hm, she has no time for flowers, pauvre mère! And poor Lisa, have you heard? They say a mysterious story and ... and again at the Stavrogin arena ... Hm. I would go to sleep ... I completely nod. And when is this ""quadrille li-te-ra-tour""?","‘A city, they say, cannot stand without seven righteous men6… seven, I think, though I do not remember the prescribed number. I do not know how many of these seven… those in our town who are in-dub-it-ably righteous… have had the honour to attend your ball, but, despite their presence, I am beginning to feel myself unsafe. Vous me pardonnerez, charmante dame, n’est-ce pas? I am speaking sym-bol-ic-ally, but I did go to the buffet, and I am glad that I returned in one piece… Our priceless Prokhorych is out of place there, and it seems that his stall will probably be pulled down by morning. However, I am jesting. I am waiting only to see how the “literary quadrille” will turn out, and then — to bed. Forgive a gout-ridden old man, but I go to bed early, and I would also advise you to “go sleepy-bye”, as they say aux enfants.7 But I’ve actually come for the beautiful young girls, whom I, of course, cannot meet anywhere in such large numbers as here. They are all from the other side of the river, and I do not go there. The wife of one officer — a chasseur,8 I think — is even not at all bad-looking, very… and… and she herself knows it. I was having a conversation with the sweet little rogue; perky and… well, the young girls are fresh-looking too, but that is all, they have nothing but freshness. However, it is a pleasure for me. There are some sweet little buds, except their lips are too thick. In general, there is little regularity in the Russian beauty of the ladies’ faces, and… and they end up looking rather like pancakes… Vous me pardonnerez, n’est-ce pas… with pretty little eyes, however… laughing little eyes. These sweet little buds are char-ming for a couple of years when they are young, even for three… and then, well, they spread out forever… producing in their husbands that sad in-dif-fer-ence, which so promotes the development of the woman question… if I understand that question correctly… Hmm. The hall is attractive; the rooms are not decorated badly. It could have been worse. The music could be much worse… I will not say that it should be. It makes a bad impression that there are generally so few ladies. I won’t say a word about the way people are dressed. It’s too bad that that man in grey trousers is so openly permitting himself to dance the cancan. I forgive him if he is doing it for the fun of it, and since he is the local apothecary… but before eleven o’clock is still early even for an apothecary … In the buffet back there two people got into a fight and were not escorted out. Before eleven, people ought to be escorted out for fighting, whatever the customs of the public are… I won’t say after two — then one has to make concessions to public opinion, and only if this ball keeps going until after two. Varvara Petrovna did not keep her word, though, and she did not contribute any flowers. Hmm, she cannot be bothered with flowers, pauvre mère!9 And poor Liza, have you heard? They say it is a mysterious story and… and again Stavrogin is in the arena. Hmm. I should leave and go to bed… I am beginning to nod off. And when will this “li-ter-a-ry quadrille” take place?’","""A city, they say, cannot stand without seven righteous men... seven , I think, I don't remember the re-com-men-ded number.1 How many of these seven... indubitably righteous men of our town... have the honor of attending your ball, I don't know, but in spite of their presence I am beginning to feel myself unsafe.

"Прошу припомнить недавнюю «экзальтацию», еще и теперь не прошедшую. Правда, и виноват же был Степан Трофимович! Но вот что решительно изумило меня тогда: то, что он с удивительным достоинством выстоял и под «обличениями» Петруши, не думая прерывать их, и под «проклятием» Варвары Петровны. Откудова взялось у него столько духа? Я узнал только одно, что он несомненно и глубоко оскорблен был давешнею первою встречей с Петрушей, именно давешними объятиями. Это было глубокое и настоящее уже горе, по крайней мере на его глаза, его сердцу. Было у него и другое горе в ту минуту, а именно язвительное собственное сознание в том, что он сподличал; в этом он мне сам потом признавался со всею откровенностью. А ведь настоящее, несомненное горе даже феноменально легкомысленного человека способно иногда сделать солидным и стойким, ну хоть на малое время; мало того, от истинного, настоящего горя даже дураки иногда умнели, тоже, разумеется, на время; это уж свойство такое горя. А если так, то что же могло произойти с таким человеком, как Степан Трофимович? Целый переворот – конечно, тоже на время.","I ask you to recall the recent “exaltation”, which has not yet passed. True, Stepan Trofimovich was to blame! But this is what resolutely amazed me then: the fact that he withstood with amazing dignity both under Petrusha's ""denunciations"", not thinking of interrupting them, and under the ""curse"" of Varvara Petrovna. Where did he get so much spirit from? I learned only one thing, that he was undoubtedly and deeply offended by the recent first meeting with Petrusha, precisely by the embraces of the past. It was a deep and real grief already, at least in his eyes, his heart. He also had another grief at that moment, namely, his own caustic consciousness that he was being mean; he later confessed this to me with all frankness. But real, undoubted grief can sometimes make even a phenomenally frivolous person solid and persistent, well, at least for a short time; moreover, from true, real grief, even fools sometimes grew wiser, also, of course, for a while; this property is such a grief. And if so, what could happen to such a person as Stepan Trofimovich? A whole coup - of course, also for a while.","I ask you to recall her recent ‘exaltation’, which had not passed even now. True enough, Stepan Trofimovich was unquestionably guilty! But here’s what positively astounded me then: the fact that he stood his ground with surprising dignity, even in the face of Petrusha’s ‘exposes’, without even thinking of trying to interrupt them, and in the face of Varvara Petrovna’s ‘curse’. Where in heaven’s name did he muster up such spirit? One thing I did learn was that he had undoubtedly been deeply offended by this first meeting with Petrusha, specifically by the way they had exchanged embraces. This was a deep and genuine sorrow to his heart, at least as he saw it. At that moment he felt another sorrow as well, namely, the sting of his own awareness for having acted like a scoundrel; he later admitted this to me in all frankness. Yet the genuine, unambiguous sorrow of even a phenomenally frivolous man is sometimes capable of making him solid and steadfast, albeit for a short time. Moreover, sincere, genuine sorrow has sometimes even made fools wise, also, of course, for a time; such is precisely the nature of sorrow. And if that’s the case, then what might conceivably happen with a man like Stepan Trofimovich? A whole radical turnabout — only for a time, of course.","I must ask you to bear in mind her recent ""exaltation,"" which still had not passed. True, Stepan Trofimovich really was to blame!

He had yet another grief at that moment, namely, his own morbid awareness that he had acted basely; this he confessed to me later in all frankness. And a real, undoubted grief is sometimes capable of making a solid and steadfast man even out of a phenomenally light-minded one, if only for a short time; moreover, real and true grief has sometimes even made fools more intelligent, also only for a time, of course; grief has this property. And, if so, then what might transpire with a man like Stepan Trofimovich? A whole revolution-also, of course, only for a time."

"Великий писатель квартировал в доме своей сестры, жены камергера и помещицы; оба они, и муж и жена, благоговели пред знаменитым родственником, но в настоящий приезд его находились оба в Москве, к великому их сожалению, так что принять его имела честь старушка, очень дальняя и бедная родственница камергера, проживавшая в доме и давно уже заведовавшая всем домашним хозяйством. Весь дом заходил на цыпочках с приездом господина Кармазинова. Старушка извещала в Москву чуть не каждый день о том, как он почивал и что изволил скушать, а однажды отправила телеграмму с известием, что он, после званого обеда у градского головы, принужден был принять ложку одного лекарства. В комнату к нему она осмеливалась входить редко, хотя он обращался с нею вежливо, впрочем сухо, и говорил с нею только по какой-нибудь надобности. Когда вошел Петр Степанович, он кушал утреннюю свою котлетку с полстаканом красного вина. Петр Степанович уже и прежде бывал у него и всегда заставал его за этою утреннею котлеткой, которую тот и съедал в его присутствии, но ни разу его самого не попотчевал. После котлетки подавалась еще маленькая чашечка кофе. Лакей, внесший кушанье, был во фраке, в мягких неслышных сапогах и в перчатках.","The great writer lodged in the house of his sister, the wife of a chamberlain and a landowner; both of them, both husband and wife, were in awe of the famous relative, but at his present visit both were in Moscow, to their great regret, so that an old woman, a very distant and poor relative of the chamberlain, who lived in the house and had long been in charge of the whole household. The whole house came on tiptoe with the arrival of Mr. Karmazinov. The old woman informed Moscow almost every day about how he slept and what he deigned to eat, and once sent a telegram with the news that, after a dinner party at the head of the city, he was forced to take a spoonful of one medicine. She rarely dared to enter his room, although he treated her politely, however dryly, and spoke to her only when needed.

Pyotr Stepanovitch had been to him before and always caught him eating this morning cutlet, which he ate in his presence, but he never treated him himself.

"Признаюсь, я не верил ушам своим. Тут была такая явная наглость, что возможности не было извинить Липутина даже глупостью. А Липутин уж как был не глуп. Намерение было ясное, для меня по крайней мере: как будто торопились беспорядком. Некоторые стихи этого идиотского стихотворения, например самый последний, были такого рода, что никакая глупость не могла бы его допустить. Липутин, кажется, и сам почувствовал, что слишком много взял на себя: совершив свой подвиг, он так опешил от собственной дерзости, что даже не уходил с эстрады и стоял, как будто желая что-то еще прибавить. Он, верно, предполагал, что выйдет как-нибудь в другом роде; но даже кучка безобразников, аплодировавшая во время выходки, вдруг замолкла, тоже как бы опешившая. Глупее всего, что многие из них приняли всю выходку патетически, то есть вовсе не за пасквиль, а действительно за реальную правду насчет гувернантки, за стишки с направлением. Но излишняя развязность стихов поразила наконец и их. Что же до всей публики, то вся зала не только была скандализована, но видимо обиделась. Я не ошибаюсь, передавая впечатление. Юлия Михайловна говорила потом, что еще мгновение, и она бы упала в обморок. Один из самых наипочтеннейших старичков поднял свою старушку, и оба вышли из залы под провожавшими их тревожными взглядами публики. Кто знает, может быть, пример увлек бы и еще некоторых, если бы в ту минуту не явился на эстраду сам Кармазинов, во фраке и в белом галстуке и с тетрадью в руке. Юлия Михайловна обратила на него восторженный взгляд, как на избавителя… Но я уже был за кулисами; мне надо было Липутина.","I confess, I did not believe my ears. There was such obvious impudence that there was no way to excuse Liputin even with stupidity. But Liputin was not stupid. The intention was clear, to me at least: as if they were in a hurry with a mess. Some verses of this idiotic poem, for example the last one, were of such a kind that no stupidity could allow it. Liputin, it seems, himself felt that he had taken on too much: having accomplished his feat, he was so taken aback by his own audacity that he did not even leave the stage and stood, as if wanting to add something else. He probably assumed that it would come out in some other way; but even a bunch of ugly people who were applauding during the outburst suddenly fell silent, also as if taken aback. The stupidest thing is that many of them took the whole trick pathetically, that is, not at all for a libel, but really for the real truth about the governess, for rhymes with a direction. But the excessive swagger of the verses struck them at last. As for the entire audience, the entire hall was not only scandalized, but apparently offended. I am not mistaken in conveying the impression. Yulia Mihailovna said afterwards that another moment and she would have fainted. One of the most respectable old men picked up his old woman, and both left the hall under the anxious looks of the public that followed them. Who knows, maybe some others would have been carried away by the example, if Karmazinov himself had not appeared on the stage at that moment, in a tailcoat and white tie and with a notebook in his hand. Yulia Mikhailovna turned an enthusiastic look on him, as on a deliverer... But I was already backstage; I needed Liputin.","I confess I couldn’t believe my ears. This was such brazen insolence that it was impossible to excuse Liputin even on the grounds of stupidity. And Liputin was certainly by no means stupid. The intention was obvious, at least to me: they seemed to be in a hurry to throw things into disorder. Several stanzas of this idiotic poem, for example the very last, were of such a nature that no amount of stupidity could have allowed them. Liputin himself seemed to feel that he had gone too far: after accomplishing his bold deed, he was so taken aback by his own brazenness that he didn’t even leave the platform, but stood there as if wishing to add something more. He probably imagined that the result would be different, but even the little band of hooligans who had been applauding during this escapade suddenly fell silent, as if they were also taken aback. The stupidest thing of all was that many of them took the whole escapade seriously, that is, not at all as a lampoon, but actually as a true statement about a governess, as a poem with a political message. But the sheer cheekiness of the verses finally struck even them. As far as the audience as a whole was concerned, the entire hall was not only scandalized, but visibly offended. I’m not mistaken about the impression I’m reporting. Yuliya Mikhaylovna later said that if it had gone on for another minute, she would have fainted. One of the most highly respected little old men helped his wife to her feet, and they both walked out of the hall accompanied by the anxious looks of the audience. Who knows, their example might have inspired others as well if Karmazinov himself hadn’t appeared on the platform at that moment, in tail-coat and white tie, notebook in hand. Yuliya Mikhaylovna looked at him ecstatically, as if he were a saviour. But I was already backstage; I needed to get hold of Liputin.","I confess, I did not believe my ears. Here was such obvious impudence that it was impossible to excuse Liputin even by stupidity. And, anyway, Liputin was far from stupid. The intention was clear, to me at least: they were as if hastening the disorder. Some lines of this idiotic poem, the very last one, for example, were of a sort that no stupidity would allow. Liputin himself seemed to feel that he had taken on too much: having accomplished his great deed, he was so taken aback by his own boldness that he did not even leave the platform, but went on standing there as if wishing to add something. He must have supposed it would come out somehow differently; but even the bunch of hooligans who had applauded during the escapade suddenly fell silent, as if they, too, were taken aback. Stupidest of all was that many of them took the whole escapade in a pathetic sense-that is, not as lampoonery, but indeed as the real truth concerning governesses, as verse with a tendency. But these people, too, were finally struck by the excessive license of the poem. As for the rest of the public, the entire hall was not only scandalized but visibly offended. I am not mistaken in conveying the impression. Yulia Mikhailovna said afterwards that she would have fainted in another moment. One of the most venerable little old men helped his little old lady to her feet, and they both left the hall, followed by the alarmed eyes of the public. Who knows, the example might have carried others along as well, if at that moment Karmazinov himself had not appeared on the platform, in a tailcoat and white tie, and with a notebook in his hand. Yulia Mikhailovna turned rapturous eyes to him, as to a deliverer... But by then I had already gone backstage; I was after Liputin."

"Петруша выслал, впрочем, очень скоро свой точный адрес из Швейцарии для обычной ему высылки денег: стало быть, не совсем же был эмигрантом. И вот теперь, пробыв за границей года четыре, вдруг появляется опять в своем отечестве и извещает о скором своем прибытии: стало быть, ни в чем не обвинен. Мало того, даже как будто кто-то принимал в нем участие и покровительствовал ему. Он писал теперь с юга России, где находился по чьему-то частному, но важному поручению и об чем-то там хлопотал. Всё это было прекрасно, но, однако, где же взять остальные семь-восемь тысяч, чтобы составить приличный maximum цены за имение? А что, если подымется крик и вместо величественной картины дойдет до процесса? Что-то говорило Степану Трофимовичу, что чувствительный Петруша не отступится от своих интересов. «Почему это, я заметил, – шепнул мне раз тогда Степан Трофимович, – почему это все эти отчаянные социалисты и коммунисты в то же время и такие неимоверные скряги, приобретатели, собственники, и даже так, что чем больше он социалист, чем дальше пошел, тем сильнее и собственник… почему это? Неужели тоже от сентиментальности?» Я не знаю, есть ли правда в этом замечании Степана Трофимовича; я знаю только, что Петруша имел некоторые сведения о продаже рощи и о прочем, а Степан Трофимович знал, что тот имеет эти сведения. Мне случалось тоже читать и Петрушины письма к отцу; писал он до крайности редко, раз в год и еще реже. Только в последнее время, уведомляя о близком своем приезде, прислал два письма, почти одно за другим. Все письма его были коротенькие, сухие, состояли из одних лишь распоряжений, и так как отец с сыном еще с самого Петербурга были, по-модному, на ты, то и письма Петруши решительно имели вид тех старинных предписаний прежних помещиков из столиц их дворовым людям, поставленным ими в управляющие их имений. И вдруг теперь эти восемь тысяч, разрешающие дело, вылетают из предложения Варвары Петровны, и при этом она дает ясно почувствовать, что они ниоткуда более и не могут вылететь. Разумеется, Степан Трофимович согласился.","Petrusha, however, very soon sent his exact address from Switzerland for the usual sending of money to him: therefore, he was not exactly an emigrant. And now, after spending four years abroad, he suddenly appears again in his own country and announces his imminent arrival: therefore, he is not accused of anything. Moreover, even as if someone took part in it and patronized it. He was now writing from the south of Russia, where he was on someone's private, but important assignment, and was busy with something there. All this was fine, but, however, where to get the remaining seven or eight thousand to make up a decent maximum price for the estate? But what if a cry rises up and instead of a majestic picture it comes to a process? Something told Stepan Trofimovich that the sensitive Petrusha would not give up his interests. “Why is this, I noticed,” Stepan Trofimovich whispered to me once then, “why is it all these desperate socialists and communists at the same time and such incredible misers, acquirers, proprietors, and even so that the more he is a socialist, the further he went , the stronger and the owner… why is that? Is it also from sentimentality? I don't know if there is truth in this remark by Stepan Trofimovich; I only know that Petrusha had some information about the sale of the grove and about other things, and Stepan Trofimovich knew that he had this information. I also happened to read Petrusha's letters to his father; He wrote extremely rarely, once a year and even less often. Only recently, notifying of his imminent arrival, he sent two letters, almost one after the other. All his letters were short, dry, consisted of nothing but orders, and since the father and son had been, in a fashionable way, on you since St. put by them in the managers of their estates. And suddenly now these eight thousand, solving the case, fly out of Varvara Petrovna's proposal, and at the same time she makes it clear that they cannot fly out from anywhere else. Of course, Stepan Trofimovich agreed.","However, Petrusha very soon sent his exact address from Switzerland so that the usual sum of money could be sent to him; therefore, he was certainly not really an emigre. And now, having lived abroad for some four years, he suddenly appeared in his native land again and announced his impending arrival: consequently, he stood accused of nothing. What was more, it even appeared that someone had taken an interest in him and was protecting him. Now he wrote from the south of Russia, where he was on some private but important mission and was busy with something. That was all well and good, but still, where were the remaining seven or eight thousand roubles to be found, so that a decent maximum price could be put on the property? And what if there should be an outcry, and instead of a grand picture matters should come to a lawsuit? Something told Stepan Trofimovich that the sensitive Petrusha would not forego his own interests. ‘Why is it, as I’ve observed,’ Stepan Trofimovich whispered to me on one occasion just then, ‘why is it that these desperate socialists and communists are at the same time so unbelievably stingy, so interested in acquiring things, so devoted to private property, and even to the point that the more a man is a socialist, the deeper he’s into it , the stronger his property instinct… Why is that? Could this be the result of sentimentalism too?’ I don’t know if there’s any truth to this observation of Stepan Trofimovich ’s; all I know is that Petrusha had certain information about the sale of the woods and the rest of it, and that Stepan Trofimovich knew that he had this information. I also had occasion to read Petrusha’s letters to his father. For him to write was extremely rare — once a year, and even less often. Only recently, by way of notifying us of his forthcoming arrival, he sent two letters, one virtually following on the other. All his letters were rather brief and dry, and consisted of nothing but instructions, and inasmuch as father and son had been on terms of familiar address ever since Petersburg, as was the fashion, this meant that Petrusha’s letters had the unmistakably old-fashioned look of the orders that landowners in both capitals once used to send their house-serfs whom they had put in charge of administering their properties. And now these eight thousand roubles, which would decide the matter, suddenly fluttered down from Varvara Petrovna’s offer, and at the same time she let it be clearly understood that no more could possibly come fluttering down from anywhere else. Naturally, Stepan Trofimovich agreed.","Petrusha, by the way, very soon sent his exact address from Switzerland, so that his money could be sent as usual: therefore he was not entirely an émigré. And now, after spending about four years abroad, he suddenly reappeared in his fatherland and sent word of his imminent arrival: therefore he had not been accused of anything. Moreover, someone had supposedly even taken an interest in him and become his patron. He wrote now from the south of Russia, where he was on a private but important mission for someone and was making arrangements for something. This was all wonderful, but still, how get hold of the remaining seven or eight thousand to make up a decent maximum of the price for the estate? And what if there were an outcry, and instead of that majestic picture it should all wind up in court? Something told Stepan Trofimovich that the sensitive Petrusha would not relinquish his interests. ""Why is it, as I've noticed,"" Stepan Trofimovich once whispered to me at the time, ""why is it that all these desperate socialists and communists are at the same time such incredible misers, acquirers, property-lovers, so much so that the more socialist a man is, the further he goes, the more he loves property... why is it? Can that, too, come from sentimentality? "" I do not know what truth there is in Stepan Trofimovich's observation; I only know that Petrusha had obtained some information about the sale of the timber and the rest of it, and that Stepan Trofimovich knew he had obtained this information. I also happened to read Petrusha's letters to his father; he wrote extremely rarely, once a year or even less often. But just recently he had sent two letters, almost one after the other, giving notice of his imminent arrival. All his letters were short, dry, consisting only of directives, and as the father and son, ever since Petersburg, had been addressing each other on familiar terms, according to the fashion, Petrusha's letters looked decidedly like those letters of instruction that old-time landowners used to send from the capital to the house-serfs appointed to manage their estates. And now suddenly the eight thousand that would resolve the situation came flying out of Varvara Petrovna's proposal, and with that she let him understand clearly that it could not come flying from anywhere else. Naturally, Stepan Trofimovich accepted."

Петр Степанович провел свечой сверху вниз и опять вверх, освещая со всех точек и разглядывая это лицо. Он вдруг заметил, что Кириллов хоть и смотрит куда-то пред собой, но искоса его видит и даже, может быть, наблюдает. Тут пришла ему мысль поднести огонь прямо к лицу «этого мерзавца», поджечь и посмотреть, что тот сделает. Вдруг ему почудилось, что подбородок Кириллова шевельнулся и на губах как бы скользнула насмешливая улыбка – точно тот угадал его мысль. Он задрожал и, не помня себя, крепко схватил Кириллова за плечо.","But, having reached all the way, he again stopped in his tracks, even more stricken with horror. He was mainly struck by the fact that the figure, in spite of the cry and his furious attack, did not even move, did not move any of its members - as if petrified or wax. The pallor of her face was unnatural, her black eyes were completely motionless and stared at some point in space. Pyotr Stepanovich passed the candle from top to bottom and up again, illuminating it from all points and examining this face. He suddenly noticed that although Kirillov was looking somewhere in front of him, he saw him askance, and perhaps even observed him. Then the thought came to him to bring fire right to the face of ""this scoundrel"", set it on fire and see what he would do. Suddenly it seemed to him that Kirillov's chin moved and a mocking smile seemed to flicker on his lips - as if he had guessed his thought. He trembled and, beside himself, grabbed Kirillov tightly by the shoulder.","But once he had got there, he stopped again as if rooted to the spot, even more struck with horror. What struck him most of all was that the figure, despite his shouts and his furious attack, hadn’t even stirred, hadn’t moved a single limb, as though it were made of stone or wax. The pallor of the face was unnatural, the black eyes were completely fixed and were staring at some point in space. Pyotr Stepanovich moved the candle up and down and then up again, illuminating it from all points and scrutinizing this face. He suddenly noticed that although Kirillov was looking somewhere in front of him, he could see him out of the corner of his eye and perhaps was even watching him. Then the thought occurred to him to lift the flame straight to the face of ‘this scoundrel’, burn it and see what he would do. Suddenly he imagined that Kirillov’s chin had moved and that a mocking smile had passed across his lips — as if Kirillov had guessed what he was thinking. He began to tremble and, unaware of what he was doing, grabbed Kirillov by the shoulder.","But, coming close, he stopped again as if rooted, still more struck with horror.

"Прибыли к Семену Яковлевичу ровно в час пополудни. Ворота довольно большого купеческого дома стояли настежь, и доступ во флигель был открыт. Тотчас же узнали, что Семен Яковлевич изволит обедать, но принимает. Вся наша толпа вошла разом. Комната, в которой принимал и обедал блаженный, была довольно просторная, в три окна, и разгорожена поперек на две равные части деревянною решеткой от стены до стены, по пояс высотой. Обыкновенные посетители оставались за решеткой, а счастливцы допускались, по указанию блаженного, чрез дверцы решетки в его половину, и он сажал их, если хотел, на свои старые кожаные кресла и на диван; сам же заседал неизменно в старинных истертых вольтеровских креслах. Это был довольно большой, одутловатый, желтый лицом человек, лет пятидесяти пяти, белокурый и лысый, с жидкими волосами, бривший бороду, с раздутою правою щекой и как бы несколько перекосившимся ртом, с большою бородавкой близ левой ноздри, с узенькими глазками и с спокойным, солидным, заспанным выражением лица. Одет был по-немецки, в черный сюртук, но без жилета и без галстука. Из-под сюртука выглядывала довольно толстая, но белая рубашка; ноги, кажется больные, держал в туфлях. Я слышал, что когда-то он был чиновником и имеет чин. Он только что откушал уху из легкой рыбки и принялся за второе свое кушанье – картофель в мундире, с солью. Другого ничего и никогда не вкушал; пил только много чаю, которого был любителем. Около него сновало человека три прислуги, содержавшейся от купца; один из слуг был во фраке, другой похож на артельщика, третий на причетника. Был еще и мальчишка лет шестнадцати, весьма резвый. Кроме прислуги присутствовал и почтенный седой монах с кружкой, немного слишком полный. На одном из столов кипел огромнейший самовар и стоял поднос чуть не с двумя дюжинами стаканов. На другом столе, противоположном, помещались приношения: несколько голов и фунтиков сахару, фунта два чаю, пара вышитых туфлей, фуляровый платок, отрезок сукна, штука холста и пр. Денежные пожертвования почти все поступали в кружку монаха. В комнате было людно – человек до дюжины одних посетителей, из коих двое сидели у Семена Яковлевича за решеткой; то были седенький старичок, богомолец, из «простых», и один маленький, сухенький захожий монашек, сидевший чинно и потупив очи. Прочие посетители все стояли по сю сторону решетки, всё тоже больше из простых, кроме одного толстого купца, приезжего из уездного города, бородача, одетого по-русски, но которого знали за стотысячника; одной пожилой и убогой дворянки и одного помещика. Все ждали своего счастия, не осмеливаясь заговорить сами. Человека четыре стояли на коленях, но всех более обращал на себя внимание помещик, человек толстый, лет сорока пяти, стоявший на коленях у самой решетки, ближе всех на виду, и с благоговением ожидавший благосклонного взгляда или слова Семена Яковлевича. Стоял он уже около часу, а тот всё не замечал.","We arrived at Semyon Yakovlevich's at exactly one o'clock in the afternoon. The gates of a fairly large merchant's house stood wide open, and access to the outbuilding was open. We immediately learned that Semyon Yakovlevich was deigning to dine, but accepted. Our entire crowd entered at once. The room in which the blessed one received and dined was quite spacious, with three windows, and was partitioned across into two equal parts by a wooden lattice from wall to wall, waist-high. Ordinary visitors remained behind bars, and the lucky ones, at the direction of the blessed one, were admitted through the doors of the bars into his half, and he seated them, if he wanted, on his old leather chairs and on a sofa; he himself sat invariably in old, worn Voltaire chairs. He was a rather large, puffy, yellow-faced man, about fifty-five, blond and bald, with thin hair, shaving his beard, with a swollen right cheek and a somewhat distorted mouth, with a large wart near the left nostril, with narrow eyes and with a calm , solid, sleepy expression. He was dressed in German, in a black frock coat, but without a waistcoat and without a tie. A rather thick but white shirt peeked out from under the coat; legs, it seems sore, kept in shoes. I heard that he was once an official and has a rank. He had just bitten off an ear from a light fish and set about his second meal - jacket potatoes, with salt. I have never tasted anything else; I drank only a lot of tea, which I was a fan of. Three servants kept from the merchant were scurrying around him; one of the servants was in a tailcoat, the other looked like an artel worker, the third looked like a clerk. There was also a boy of about sixteen, very frisky. In addition to the servants, there was also a venerable gray-haired monk with a mug, a little too full. On one of the tables a huge samovar was boiling and there was a tray with almost two dozen glasses. On another table, opposite, were placed offerings: several heads and pounds of sugar, two pounds of tea, a pair of embroidered shoes, a foulard scarf, a piece of cloth, a piece of canvas, etc. Almost all monetary donations went into the monk's mug. The room was crowded - up to a dozen visitors alone, two of whom were sitting behind bars at Semyon Yakovlevich's; they were a gray-haired old man, a pilgrim, from the “simple”, and one small, scrawny nun, who sat decorously and lowered his eyes. The rest of the visitors were all standing on this side of the grate, all also mostly simple, except for one fat merchant, a visitor from a county town, a bearded man, dressed in Russian, but who was known for a hundred thousandth; one elderly and wretched noblewoman and one landowner. Everyone was waiting for their happiness, not daring to speak for themselves. Four people were on their knees, but it was the landowner who most attracted the attention of all, a fat man, about forty-five years old, who was kneeling at the very grating, closest to anyone in sight, and with reverence awaiting a favorable look or word from Semyon Yakovlevich. He stood for about an hour, but he did not notice everything.","We arrived at Semyon Yakovlevich’s8 at exactly one o’clock in the afternoon. The gate of the merchant’s rather large house stood wide open, and there was easy access to the lodge in the yard. We learned at once that Semyon Yakovlevich was having his dinner, but was receiving. Our whole crowd went in together. The room in which the blessed one was receiving and having his dinner was rather spacious, with three windows, and was divided crosswise into two equal parts by a wooden partition that extended from wall to wall, waist-high. Ordinary visitors remained on the other side of the partition, but the lucky ones were admitted, at a sign from the blessed one, through the small doors of the partition into his half, and he had them sit, if he wished, on his old leather armchairs and couch, while he himself was invariably ensconced in an ancient, battered Voltaire armchair.9 He was a rather large, somewhat bloated, sallow-faced man of about fifty-five, fair-complexioned and balding, with thinning hair, clean-shaven, a swollen right cheek and a mouth that was somehow twisted, with a large wart near his left nostril, narrow little eyes and a calm, solid, sleepy expression on his face. He was dressed in the German fashion, in a black frock-coat, but without a waistcoat or a tie. A rather coarse white shirt peeped out from beneath his frock-coat; his feet, which seemed to be ailing, he kept in slippers. I had heard that he was once a civil servant and had some sort of rank. He had just finished eating a light fish soup and had started on his second course, potatoes in their jackets, with salt. He never ate anything else; he just drank a great deal of tea, which he liked very much. Scurrying about him were three servants who were kept by the merchant. One of them wore a tail-coat, the other looked like a member of an artel, the third like a sexton. There was also a lad of about sixteen, who was very lively. There was present besides the servants a venerable grey-haired monk, a little too plump, with a collection box. On one of the tables an enormous samovar stood bubbling away, as well as a tray with almost two dozen glasses on it. On another table, standing just opposite, offerings had been placed: a few loaves and cones of sugar, some two pounds of tea, a pair of embroidered slippers, a foulard scarf, a length of cloth, a piece of linen, etc. The monetary offerings had almost all found their way into the monk’s collection box. There were a lot of people in the room: up to a dozen visitors, of whom two were sitting on the other side of the partition with Semyon Yakovlevich. They were a grey-haired little old man, a pilgrim, one of the ‘simple’ folk, and a small, dried-up little visiting monk, who was sitting modestly with downcast eyes. The other visitors were all standing on the near side of the partition, most of them also of the ‘simple’ folk, except for one fat merchant who had come here from a district town, sporting a beard, dressed in the Russian fashion, but known to be worth a hundred thousand; an elderly and impoverished woman of the gentry; and a landowner. They were all waiting for their good luck, not daring to utter a word themselves. Four people were on their knees, but the one who attracted the most attention was the landowner, a fat man of about forty-five, who was kneeling right at the partition, for all to see, reverently awaiting a gracious look or word from Semyon Yakovlevich. He had been kneeling for about an hour already, and the holy man had not taken any notice of him.","We arrived at Semyon Yakovlevich's at exactly one o'clock in the afternoon.6 The gates of the rather large merchant's house stood wide open, giving access to the wing. We learned at once that Semyon Yakovlevich was having his dinner, but was still receiving people. Our whole crowd went in together. The room in which the blessed man received and dined was quite spacious, with three windows, and was divided into two equal parts by a waist-high wooden railing from wall to wall. Ordinary visitors remained outside the railing, but the lucky ones were admitted, on the blessed man's instructions, through the gate of the railing into his part, and there he seated them, if he so desired, on his old leather chairs and sofa; while he invariably installed himself in an ancient, shabby Voltaire armchair. He was a rather big, puffy, sallow-faced man of about fifty-five, blond and bald, with thin hair, a clean-shaven chin, a swollen right cheek, and a mouth somewhat twisted, as it were, with a big wart near his left nostril, narrow little eyes, and a calm, solid, sleepy expression on his face. He was dressed German-fashion in a black frock coat, but with no waistcoat or tie.7 A rather coarse, though white, shirt peeped out from under the frock coat; on his feet, which I believe were ailing, he wore slippers. I have heard that he was once an official and had some rank. He had just finished dining upon a light fish soup and begun his second course- jacket potatoes with salt. This was all he ever dined upon; he also drank lots of tea, of which he was a great fancier. Three servants, kept by the merchant, scurried about him; one of them wore a tailcoat, the second looked like a shop foreman, the third like a beadle. There was also a lad of about sixteen, quite a frisky one. Besides the servants there was present a venerable gray-haired monk, a bit too corpulent, holding a tin cup. On one of the tables an enormous samovar was boiling, and there stood a tray with as many as two dozen glasses. On another table, across the room, offerings had been placed: several loaves and packets of sugar, about two pounds of tea, a pair of embroidered slippers, a foulard, a length of broadcloth, a piece of linen, and so on. Almost all the money that was donated went into the monk's tin cup. The room was crowded, the visitors alone numbering about a dozen, of whom two sat beyond the railing with Semyon Yakovlevich-one a gray-haired little old man, a pilgrim from ""simple folk,"" the other a small, dry monk from elsewhere who sat decorously and looked down. The rest of the visitors stood on this side of the railing, and they, too, were all mainly from simple folk, except for a fat merchant who came from a district town, a bearded fellow and dressed in Russian style, though he was known to be worth a hundred thousand; an elderly and woebegone noblewoman, and one landowner. They were all awaiting their happiness, not daring to begin speaking. Some four of them were on their knees, but it was the landowner who attracted the most attention, a fat man of about forty-five, who knelt right up against the railing where everyone could see him, and waited reverently for a benevolent glance or word from Semyon Yakovlevich. He had already been kneeling there for an hour or so, and the man had still paid him no notice."

В лице ее было нечто очень приветливое, немедленно понравившееся Степану Трофимовичу. Она только что сейчас воротилась в избу, в которой оставались ее вещи на лавке, подле самого того места, которое занял Степан Трофимович, – между прочим, портфель, на который, он помнил это, войдя, посмотрел с любопытством, и не очень большой клеенчатый мешок.

"День праздника, задуманного Юлией Михайловной по подписке в пользу гувернанток нашей губернии, уже несколько раз назначали вперед и откладывали. Около нее вертелись бессменно Петр Степанович, состоявший на побегушках маленький чиновник Лямшин, в оно время посещавший Степана Трофимовича и вдруг попавший в милость в губернаторском доме за игру на фортепиано; отчасти Липутин, которого Юлия Михайловна прочила в редакторы будущей независимой губернской газеты; несколько дам и девиц и, наконец, даже Кармазинов, который хоть и не вертелся, но вслух и с довольным видом объявил, что приятно изумит всех, когда начнется кадриль литературы. Подписчиков и жертвователей объявилось чрезвычайное множество, всё избранное городское общество; но допускались и самые неизбранные, если только являлись с деньгами. Юлия Михайловна заметила, что иногда даже должно допустить смешение сословий, «иначе кто ж их просветит?». Образовался негласный домашний комитет, на котором порешено было, что праздник будет демократический. Чрезмерная подписка манила на расходы; хотели сделать что-то чудесное – вот почему и откладывалось. Всё еще не решались, где устроить вечерний бал: в огромном ли доме предводительши, который та уступала для этого дня, или у Варвары Петровны в Скворешниках? В Скворешники было бы далеконько, но многие из комитета настаивали, что там будет «вольнее». Самой Варваре Петровне слишком хотелось бы, чтобы назначили у нее. Трудно решить, почему эта гордая женщина почти заискивала у Юлии Михайловны. Ей, вероятно, нравилось, что та, в свою очередь, почти принижается пред Николаем Всеволодовичем и любезничает с ним, как ни с кем. Повторю еще раз: Петр Степанович всё время и постоянно, шепотом, продолжал укоренять в губернаторском доме одну пущенную еще прежде идею, что Николай Всеволодович человек, имеющий самые таинственные связи в самом таинственном мире, и что наверно здесь с каким-нибудь поручением.","The day of the holiday, conceived by Yulia Mikhailovna by subscription in favor of the governesses of our province, has already been appointed several times in advance and postponed. Pyotr Stepanovich, the little official Lyamshin, who was on errands, who at that time visited Stepan Trofimovich and suddenly found himself in favor in the governor's house for playing the piano, constantly circled around her; partly Liputin, whom Yulia Mikhailovna intended to be the editor of the future independent provincial newspaper; several ladies and maidens, and, finally, even Karmazinov, who, although not fidgeting, announced aloud and with a satisfied look that he would pleasantly surprise everyone when the quadrille of literature began. An extraordinary number of subscribers and donors showed up, the entire elected city society; but even the most unelected were admitted, provided they came with money. Yulia Mikhailovna noticed that sometimes it was even necessary to allow a mixture of estates, ""otherwise who will enlighten them?"" An unspoken house committee was formed, at which it was decided that the holiday would be democratic. Excessive subscription beckoned to expenses; wanted to do something wonderful - that's why it was postponed. They still did not decide where to arrange an evening ball: in the huge house of the leader, which she gave way for this day, or at Varvara Petrovna's in Skvoreshniki? Skvoreshniki would have been far away, but many of the committee insisted that it would be ""freer"" there. Varvara Petrovna herself would very much like to be appointed to her. It is difficult to decide why this proud woman almost fawned over Yulia Mikhailovna. She probably liked that she, in turn, almost humbled herself before Nikolai Vsevolodovich and was amiable with him, as with anyone. I repeat once again: Pyotr Stepanovich all the time and constantly, in a whisper, continued to root in the governor's house one idea, which had been launched before, that Nikolai Vsevolodovich was a man who had the most mysterious connections in the most mysterious world, and that he was probably here on some assignment.","The day of the gala, which Yuliya Mikhaylovna had planned as a subscription benefit for the governesses of our province, had already been fixed several times in advance and then postponed. Constantly hovering around her were Pyotr Stepanovich; the little clerk Lyamshin, whose job it was to run errands, and who at one time used to visit Stepan Trofimovich and then suddenly found favour in the governor’s house for his piano-playing; to some extent Liputin, whom Yuliya Mikhaylovna intended to make the editor of a future independent provincial newspaper; several ladies and young girls, and finally, even Karmazinov, who, though he didn’t hover, had announced aloud and with a satisfied air that he would provide a pleasant surprise for one and all when the literary quadrille got under way. An extraordinary number of subscribers and donors declared themselves, all belonging to the select society of the town; but the most unselect were admitted as well, provided they turned up with money. Yuliya Mikhaylovna observed that sometimes a mixing of the classes should even be permitted, ‘otherwise who would there be to enlighten them’? An unofficial committee was quietly organized in her house, where it was decided that the celebration would be democratic. The inordinately large number of subscriptions tempted them to increase expenses; they wanted to do something wonderful, and that is why it kept getting postponed. It had not yet been decided where the evening ball would be held: in the enormous house of the wife of the marshal of the nobility, who had made it available for that occasion, or at Varvara Petrovna’s house in Skvoreshniki. Skvoreshniki was rather far away, but many members of the committee insisted that it would be ‘freer’ there. Varvara Petrovna herself would very much have liked for it to be held at her house. It’s hard to say why this proud woman almost fawned over Yuliya Mikhaylovna. Perhaps she was pleased that the other woman, in turn, almost grovelled at Nikolay Vsevolodovich’s feet and paid court to him, as she did with no one else. I’ll repeat once more: Pyotr Stepanovich constantly and tirelessly tried, in whispers, to implant in the governor’s house a certain idea that he had put into circulation earlier, that Nikolay Vsevolodovich was a man who had the most mysterious connections in a most mysterious world and was probably here on some mission.","The day of the fête conceived by Yulia Mikhailovna as a subscription benefit for the governesses of our province had already been fixed and canceled several times. Constantly fluttering around her were Pyotr Stepanovich; the little clerk Lyamshin, serving as errand boy, who once upon a time used to visit Stepan Trofimovich but suddenly came into favor in the governor's house for his piano playing; Liputin, partly, whom Yulia Mikhailovna planned to make the editor of a future independent provincial newspaper; a few ladies and young girls; and finally even Karmazinov, who, though he did not flutter, nevertheless announced aloud and with a satisfied air that he was going to give everyone a pleasant surprise when the quadrille of literature began. A great many subscribers and donors turned up, all select town society; though the most non-select were also admitted, as long as they came with money. Yulia Mikhailovna observed that sometimes the mixing of ranks even ought to be allowed, ""otherwise who will enlighten them?"" An unofficial home committee was formed at which it was decided that the fête should be a democratic one. The extravagant subscription list tempted them to spend; they wanted to do something wonderful-which was why it kept being postponed. They still could not decide where to organize the evening ball: at the huge house of the marshal of nobility's wife, which she had offered for the day, or at Varvara Petrovna's in Skvoreshniki. Skvoreshniki would be a bit far, but many of the committee insisted that it would be ""freer"" there. Varvara Petrovna herself was only too anxious to have it take place there. It is hard to understand why this proud woman almost fawned on Yulia Mikhailovna. She probably liked it that the woman, in her turn, almost demeaned herself before Nikolai Vsevolodovich and paid court to him as to no one else. I will repeat once more: Pyotr Stepanovich, all the time and unceasingly, in whispers, continued to cultivate in the governor's house an idea he had set going even earlier, that Nikolai Vsevolodovich was a man who had the most mysterious connections in a most mysterious world, and that he must have come on some assignment."

Накануне вы с нею переговорите, если надо будет; а на вашем вечере мы не то что объявим или там сговор какой-нибудь сделаем, а только так намекнем или дадим знать, безо всякой торжественности.

Правда, что он женится, Варвара Петровна? – быстро повернулся он к ней. – Надеюсь, что я не нескромничаю; сам же пишет, что весь город знает и все поздравляют, так что он, чтоб избежать, выходит лишь по ночам. Письмо у меня в кармане. Но поверите ли, Варвара Петровна, что я ничего в нем не понимаю! Ты мне только одно скажи, Степан Трофимович, поздравлять тебя надо или «спасать»? Вы не поверите, рядом с самыми счастливыми строками у него отчаяннейшие. Во-первых, просит у меня прощения; ну, положим, это в их нравах… А впрочем, нельзя не сказать: вообразите, человек в жизни видел меня два раза, да и то нечаянно, и вдруг теперь, вступая в третий брак, воображает, что нарушает этим ко мне какие-то родительские обязанности, умоляет меня за тысячу верст, чтоб я не сердился и разрешил ему! Ты, пожалуйста, не обижайся, Степан Трофимович, черта времени, я широко смотрю и не осуждаю, и это, положим, тебе делает честь и т. д., и т. д., но опять-таки главное в том, что главного-то не понимаю. Тут что-то о каких-то «грехах в Швейцарии». Женюсь, дескать, по грехам, или из-за чужих грехов, или как у него там, – одним словом, «грехи». «Девушка, говорит, перл и алмаз», ну и, разумеется, «он недостоин» – их слог; но из-за каких-то там грехов или обстоятельств «принужден идти к венцу и ехать в Швейцарию», а потому «бросай всё и лети спасать». Понимаете ли вы что-нибудь после этого? А впрочем… а впрочем, я по выражению лиц замечаю (повертывался он с письмом в руках, с невинною улыбкой всматриваясь в лица), что, по моему обыкновению, я, кажется, в чем-то дал маху… по глупой моей откровенности или, как Николай Всеволодович говорит, торопливости.

Please, don’t be offended, Stepan Trofimovich, a feature of the times, I look broadly and don’t condemn, and this, let’s say, does you credit, etc., etc., but again, the main thing is that the main I don't understand.

And yet ... but by the way, I notice from the expression on their faces (he turned around with a letter in his hands, peering into faces with an innocent smile) that, as is my custom, I seem to have blundered in something ... due to my stupid frankness or, as Nikolai Vsevolodovich says, haste.

But because of some sins or circumstances there, he is “forced to make a trip to the altar and go to Switzerland”, and I’m supposed to “drop everything and come flying to save” him?

"– Ну чего ж вы… полноте… этак руку сломаете… тут главное в том, как это обернулось, – затрещал он вновь, нимало даже не удивившись удару. – Я с вечера выдаю деньги, с тем чтоб он и сестрица завтра чем свет отправлялись; поручаю это дельце подлецу Липутину, чтобы сам посадил и отправил. Но мерзавцу Липутину понадобилось сошкольничать с публикой – может быть, слышали? На «чтении»? Слушайте же, слушайте: оба пьют, сочиняют стихи, из которых половина липутинских; тот его одевает во фрак, меня между тем уверяет, что уже отправил с утра, а его бережет где-то в задней каморке, чтобы выпихнуть на эстраду. Но тот быстро и неожиданно напивается. Затем известный скандал, затем его доставляют домой полумертвого, а Липутин у него вынимает тихонько двести рублей, оставляя мелочь. Но, к несчастью, оказывается, что тот уже утром эти двести рублей тоже из кармана вынимал, хвастался и показывал где не следует. А так как Федька того и ждал, а у Кириллова кое-что слышал (помните, ваш намек?), то и решился воспользоваться. Вот и вся правда. Я рад по крайней мере, что Федька денег не нашел, а ведь на тысячу подлец рассчитывал! Торопился и пожара, кажется, сам испугался… Верите, мне этот пожар как поленом по голове. Нет, это черт знает что такое! Это такое самовластие… Вот видите, я пред вами, столького от вас ожидая, ничего не потаю: ну да, у меня уже давно эта идейка об огне созревала, так как она столь народна и популярна; но ведь я берег ее на критический час, на то драгоценное мгновение, когда мы все встанем и… А они вдруг вздумали своевластно и без приказу теперь, в такое мгновение, когда именно надо бы притаиться да в кулак дышать! Нет, это такое самовластие!.. одним словом, я еще ничего не знаю, тут говорят про двух шпигулинских… но если тут есть и наши, если хоть один из них тут погрел свои руки – горе тому! Вот видите, что значит хоть капельку распустить! Нет, эта демократическая сволочь с своими пятерками – плохая опора; тут нужна одна великолепная, кумирная, деспотическая воля, опирающаяся на нечто не случайное и вне стоящее… Тогда и пятерки подожмут хвосты повиновения и с подобострастием пригодятся при случае. Но во всяком случае, хоть там теперь и кричат во все трубы, что Ставрогину надо было жену сжечь, для того и город сгорел, но…","“Well, why are you ... fullness ... you’ll break your arm that way ... the main thing here is how it turned out,” he crackled again, not even surprised at the blow. - I have been giving out money since the evening, so that he and his sister will go tomorrow than the light; I entrust this business to the scoundrel Liputin, so that he himself planted and sent. But the bastard Liputin needed to school with the public - maybe you heard? On ""reading""? Listen, listen: both drink, compose poems, of which half are Liputin; he dresses him in a tailcoat, meanwhile assures me that he has already sent him off in the morning, and he is saving him somewhere in the back closet in order to push him onto the stage. But he quickly and unexpectedly gets drunk. Then a well-known scandal, then he was brought home half dead, and Liputin quietly took out two hundred rubles from him, leaving a change. But, unfortunately, it turns out that already in the morning he also took these two hundred rubles out of his pocket, boasted and showed where he shouldn’t. And since Fedka was waiting for this, and he heard something from Kirillov (remember, your hint?), I decided to take advantage of it. That's the whole truth. I'm glad at least that Fedka didn't find the money, but the scoundrel was counting on a thousand! I was in a hurry and the fire, it seems, was frightened myself ... Believe me, this fire is like a log on the head for me. No, what the hell is that! This is such autocracy ... You see, I am expecting so much from you, I do not conceal anything: well, yes, this idea about fire has been ripening for a long time, since it is so popular and popular; but after all, I was saving it for the critical hour, for that precious moment when we all get up and ... But they suddenly took it into their head, self-willedly and without an order, now, at such a moment when it would be necessary to hide and breathe in a fist! No, this is such autocracy!.. in a word, I don’t know anything yet, they are talking about two Shpigulin’s here ... but if there are ours here, if at least one of them warmed his hands here - woe to him! You see what it means to dissolve at least a drop! No, this democratic bastard with his fives is a poor support; here one needs one magnificent, idol, despotic will, based on something not accidental and outside of standing ... Then the fives will turn the tails of obedience and come in handy with servility on occasion. But in any case, even though they are now shouting through all the trumpets that Stavrogin should have burned his wife, that’s why the city burned down, but ...","‘Come now, what are you doing? … enough… you’ll break my arm that way… Here the main thing is the way it turned out…’ he began to chatter again, not in the least surprised at the blow. ‘ I handed over the money to him that evening, so that he and his sister could set out the next morning at dawn. I entrusted this simple little task to that scoundrel Liputin, getting them on the train and seeing them off. But that scoundrel Liputin felt the need to play his schoolboy pranks on the audience — perhaps you’ve heard? At the “reading”? Now listen, listen: both were drinking and writing the poem, half of which is Liputin’s, who dresses Lebyadkin up in a tail-coat, while assuring me in the meantime that he’d already sent him off that morning, meanwhile he was actually keeping him somewhere in a back room so that he could push him out on to the platform. But Lebyadkin quickly and unexpectedly has far too much to drink. Then follows the well-known scandal, and then he is delivered home half-dead, and Liputin quietly takes two hundred roubles from him, leaving just some small change. But unfortunately, it turned out that Lebyadkin that same morning had also taken these two hundred roubles out of his pocket, bragged about them and showed them around where he shouldn’t have. And since that was exactly what Fedka was waiting for, and since he’d heard something at Kirillov’s (you remember your hint?), he made up his mind to take advantage of it. That’s the whole truth. I’m glad at least that Fedka didn’t find the money — the scoundrel was counting on a thousand, you know! He was in a hurry, and he was frightened by the fire, it seems. Believe me, that fire hit me like a blow to the head. No, the Devil knows what sort of thing that is! It’s taking matters into your own hands. There, you see, since I expect so much from you, I won’t hide anything from you. Well, yes, the nice little idea of having a fire had been ripening in my mind for a long time, since it’s something so popular and so dear to the common people. But you know, I was saving it for a critical time, for the precious moment when we would all rise up and… And they suddenly took it into their heads to act on their own and without orders, now, at precisely the moment when they should have been lying low and keeping quiet! No, that’s really taking things into their own hands! In a nutshell, I don’t know anything yet, the talk around here now is about two Shpigulin workers, but if our people are involved in it as well, if even one of them warmed his hands — then woe betide him! Now you see what it means to let things get out of hand even a tiny bit! No, this democratic riff-raff with their groups of five is a poor foundation. What’s needed is one single magnificent, despotic will, like an idol, that rests on something fundamental yet external… Then even the groups of five will put their tails between their legs and obey, and will prove useful in their servile way when needed. But in any event, even though everyone out there is now loudly trumpeting the news that Stavrogin had to have his wife burnt to death and that’s why the town was burnt down as well, still…’","""What's this now ... come on ... you'll break my arm ... the main thing here is how it turned out,"" he rattled on, not even the least surprised at being hit. ""I hand him the money in the evening, so that he and his dear sister can set out the next day at dawn; I charge the scoundrel Liputin with that little business, putting them on the train and seeing them off himself. But the blackguard Liputin felt the need to pull a prank on the public-maybe you heard? At the 'reading'? So listen, listen: the two of them drink, compose verses, half belonging to Liputin; he dresses him up in a tailcoat, assures me he sent him off in the morning, all the while keeping him somewhere in a back closet, in order to push him out onto the platform. But he quickly and unexpectedly gets drunk. Then the notorious scandal, then he's brought home more dead than alive, and Liputin takes the two hundred roubles from him on the sly, leaving him some change. But, unfortunately, it turns out that he had already taken the two hundred out of his pocket in the morning, boasting and showing it where he shouldn't have. And since Fedka was just waiting for that, and had heard something at Kirillov's (remember your hint?) , he decided to make use of it. That's the whole truth. I'm glad at least that Fedka didn't find the money- and he was counting on getting a thousand, the scoundrel! He was in a hurry and, it seems, was frightened by the fire himself... Would you believe it, that fire was a real whack on the head for me. No, it's the devil knows what! It's such high-handedness... Look, I won't conceal anything, since I expect so much from you: so, yes, I've had this little idea of a fire ripening in me for a long time, since it's so national and popular; but I was keeping it for a critical hour, for that precious moment when we all rise up and... And they suddenly decided it high-handedly and without any orders, now, precisely when they should have laid low and held their breath! No, it's such highhandedness! ... in short, I still don't know anything, they're talking here about two Shpigulin men... but if ours were in it as well, if any one of them warmed his hands at it-woe to him! You see what it means to slacken even a little! No, this democratic scum with its fivesomes is a poor support; what we need is one splendid, monumental, despotic will, supported by something external and not accidental... Then the fivesomes will also put their tails of obedience between their legs, and their obsequiousness will occasionally come in handy.

"Но тут случилось самое неожиданное обстоятельство. Фон Лембке уже несколько времени находился в салоне, но как бы никем не примеченный, хотя все видели, как он вошел.

"Скажу прямо: Степан Трофимович постоянно играл между нами некоторую особую и, так сказать, гражданскую роль и любил эту роль до страсти, – так даже, что, мне кажется, без нее и прожить не мог. Не то чтоб уж я его приравнивал к актеру на театре: сохрани боже, тем более что сам его уважаю. Тут всё могло быть делом привычки, или, лучше сказать, беспрерывной и благородной склонности, с детских лет, к приятной мечте о красивой гражданской своей постановке. Он, например, чрезвычайно любил свое положение «гонимого» и, так сказать, «ссыльного». В этих обоих словечках есть своего рода классический блеск, соблазнивший его раз навсегда, и, возвышая его потом постепенно в собственном мнении, в продолжение столь многих лет, довел его наконец до некоторого весьма высокого и приятного для самолюбия пьедестала. В одном сатирическом английском романе прошлого столетия некто Гулливер, возвратясь из страны лилипутов, где люди были всего в какие-нибудь два вершка росту, до того приучился считать себя между ними великаном, что, и ходя по улицам Лондона, невольно кричал прохожим и экипажам, чтоб они пред ним сворачивали и остерегались, чтоб он как-нибудь их не раздавил, воображая, что он всё еще великан, а они маленькие. За это смеялись над ним и бранили его, а грубые кучера даже стегали великана кнутьями; но справедливо ли? Чего не может сделать привычка? Привычка привела почти к тому же и Степана Трофимовича, но еще в более невинном и безобидном виде, если можно так выразиться, потому что прекраснейший был человек.","I'll say it straight: Stepan Trofimovich constantly played between us a certain special and, so to speak, civic role and loved this role to the point of passion - so much so that, it seems to me, he could not live without it. Not that I equated him with an actor in the theater: God forbid, especially since I respect him myself. Here everything could be a matter of habit, or, to put it better, of an uninterrupted and noble inclination, from childhood, to a pleasant dream of a beautiful civil production of one's own. For example, he was extremely fond of his position as a “persecuted” and, so to speak, “exiled”. There is a kind of classical brilliance in these two words, which seduced him once and for all, and, gradually raising him up in his own opinion over the course of so many years, finally brought him to some very high and pleasing pedestal for pride. In one satirical English novel of the last century, a certain Gulliver, returning from the country of the Lilliputians, where people were only two inches tall, had so much learned to consider himself a giant among them, that, walking along the streets of London, he involuntarily shouted to passers-by and carriages, so that they turn in front of him and beware that he somehow crushes them, imagining that he is still a giant, and they are small. For this, they laughed at him and scolded him, and rude coachmen even whipped the giant with whips; but is it fair? What can habit not do? Habit led Stepan Trofimovich almost to the same thing, but in an even more innocent and harmless form, so to speak, because he was a most beautiful person.","I’ll say it straight out: Stepan Trofimovich was constantly playing a certain special role among us, one that might be called civic, and he passionately loved this role, so much so that I even think he could not have gone on living without it. It’s not that I’m putting him on the same level with a stage actor, by no means: God forbid, the more so as I myself have great respect for him. It could all have been a question of habit, or rather, of a constant and high-minded tendency, from childhood on, to indulge in pleasant daydreams about the fine figure he would cut as a citizen of our town. For example, he was inordinately fond of his position as a man who was ‘persecuted’ and, so to speak, ‘ exiled’.1 Both these little words have a kind of classical lustre to them, which had proved enduringly seductive to him, and, with the passage of so many years, had gradually raised him in his own opinion of himself and finally placed him on a pedestal that was very lofty and gratifying to his self-esteem. In a certain English satirical novel of the last century, one Gulliver, on returning from the land of the Lilliputians, where the people stood no more than about four inches tall, had become so accustomed to regarding himself as a giant among them that, while walking through the streets of London, he could not keep from shouting to passers-by and carriages to get out of his way and take care that he didn’t crush them, imagining that he was still a giant and they were small.2 For this they jeered at him and abused him, and crude coachmen gave the giant a taste of their whips. But was that just? What is habit not capable of? Habit had brought Stepan Trofimovich to almost the same position too, but in a more innocent and inoffensive way, if one can put it like that, because he was a splendid human being.","I will say straight off: Stepan Trofimovich constantly played a certain special and, so to speak, civic role among us, and loved this role to the point of passion-so much so that it even seems to me he would have been unable to live without it. Not that I equate him with a stage actor: God forbid, particularly as I happen to respect him. It could all have been a matter of habit, or, better, of a ceaseless and noble disposition, from childhood on, towards a pleasant dream of his beautiful civic stance. He was, for example, greatly enamored of his position as a ""persecuted"" man and, so to speak, an ""exile. ""1 There is a sort of classical luster to these two little words that seduced him once and for all, and, later raising him gradually in his own estimation over the course of so many years, brought him finally to some sort of pedestal, rather lofty and gratifying to his vanity.

For which people laughed at him and abused him, and rude coachmen even struck the giant with their whips-but was that fair? What will habit not do to a man? Habit brought Stepan Trofimovich to much the same thing, but in a still more innocent and inoffensive form, if one may put it so, for he was a most excellent man."

Часть третья,Part three,PART III,Part Three
"Дело в том, что молодой Верховенский с первого шагу обнаружил решительную непочтительность к Андрею Антоновичу и взял над ним какие-то странные права, а Юлия Михайловна, всегда столь ревнивая к значению своего супруга, вовсе не хотела этого замечать; по крайней мере не придавала важности. Молодой человек стал ее фаворитом, ел, пил и почти спал в доме. Фон Лембке стал защищаться, называл его при людях «молодым человеком», покровительственно трепал по плечу, но этим ничего не внушил: Петр Степанович всё как будто смеялся ему в глаза, даже разговаривая, по-видимому, серьезно, а при людях говорил ему самые неожиданные вещи. Однажды, возвратясь домой, он нашел молодого человека у себя в кабинете, спящим на диване без приглашения. Тот объяснил, что зашел, но, не застав дома, «кстати выспался». Фон Лембке был обижен и снова пожаловался супруге; осмеяв его раздражительность, та колко заметила, что он сам, видно, не умеет стать на настоящую ногу; по крайней мере с ней «этот мальчик» никогда не позволяет себе фамильярностей, а впрочем, «он наивен и свеж, хотя и вне рамок общества». Фон Лембке надулся. В тот раз она их помирила. Петр Степанович не то чтобы попросил извинения, а отделался какою-то грубою шуткой, которую в другой раз можно было бы принять за новое оскорбление, но в настоящем случае приняли за раскаяние. Слабое место состояло в том, что Андрей Антонович дал маху с самого начала, а именно сообщил ему свой роман. Вообразив в нем пылкого молодого человека с поэзией и давно уже мечтая о слушателе, он еще в первые дни знакомства прочел ему однажды вечером две главы. Тот выслушал, не скрывая скуки, невежливо зевал, ни разу не похвалил, но, уходя, выпросил себе рукопись, чтобы дома на досуге составить мнение, а Андрей Антонович отдал. С тех пор он рукописи не возвращал, хотя и забегал ежедневно, а на вопрос отвечал только смехом; под конец объявил, что потерял ее тогда же на улице. Узнав о том, Юлия Михайловна рассердилась на своего супруга ужасно.","The fact is that young Verkhovensky from the first step showed a decided disrespect for Andrei Antonovich and took some strange rights over him, and Yulia Mikhailovna, always so jealous of the importance of her husband, did not want to notice this at all; at least it didn't matter. The young man became her favourite, eating, drinking and almost sleeping in the house. Von Lembke began to defend himself, called him a “young man” in public, patted him patronizingly on the shoulder, but this did not inspire anything: Pyotr Stepanovich seemed to be laughing in his eyes, even speaking, apparently, seriously, but in public he spoke to him the most unexpected things. One day, returning home, he found a young man in his office, sleeping uninvited on the couch. He explained that he had come in, but, not finding himself at home, “by the way, he slept.” Von Lembke was offended and again complained to his wife; ridiculing his irritability, she sharply remarked that he himself apparently did not know how to stand on a real foot; at least with her, ""this boy"" never allows himself familiarities, but, by the way, ""he is naive and fresh, although outside the framework of society."" Von Lembke pouted. At that time, she reconciled them. Pyotr Stepanovitch did not exactly ask for an apology, but escaped with some kind of rude joke, which on another occasion could have been taken for a new insult, but in the present case they took it for remorse. The weak point was that Andrei Antonovich made a mistake from the very beginning, namely, he told him his novel. Imagining in him an ardent young man with poetry and dreaming of a listener for a long time, he read two chapters to him one evening in the first days of their acquaintance. He listened, not hiding his boredom, yawned impolitely, never once praised, but, as he left, he begged himself for a manuscript so that he could form an opinion at his leisure at home, and Andrei Antonovich gave it to him. Since then, he has not returned the manuscript, although he ran every day, and answered the question only with laughter; in the end, he announced that he had lost her in the street at the same time. Upon learning of this, Yulia Mikhailovna became terribly angry with her husband.","The fact was that the young Verkhovensky, from the very outset, had displayed a decided lack of respect for Andrey Antonovich and had appropriated some strange rights over him, while Yuliya Mikhaylovna, who had always been so jealous of her husband’s position, absolutely refused to take note of this; at least, she attached no importance to it. The young man became her favourite, he ate, drank, and practically slept in their house. Von Lembke tried to defend himself, calling him ‘young man’ when other people were present, and patronizingly patting him on the shoulder, but he got nowhere with this: Pyotr Stepanovich still seemed to be laughing in his face, even when an apparently serious conversation was under way, and when other people were present, he would say the most unexpected things to him. Once, on returning home, he found the young man in his study, sleeping on the sofa uninvited. Pyotr Stepanovich explained that he had dropped by, but not finding him at home, ‘took the opportunity of having a good nap’. Von Lembke was offended, and again complained to his wife, who, risking his irritation, noted acerbically that he himself apparently didn’t know how to stand on his own two feet; at least ‘this boy’ never permitted himself any familiarities with her, and besides, he was ‘naive and fresh, albeit outside the conventions of society’. Von Lembke went into a sulk. On that occasion she made peace between them. Pyotr Stepanovich didn’t exactly ask forgiveness, but instead got out of it with some coarse joke, which at another time might have been taken as a fresh insult, but in the present circumstances was taken as repentance. The weakness of Andrey Antonovich’s position came from the mistake he had made at the very outset, namely, telling him about his novel. Imagining him to be an ardent young man with poetry in his soul, and long dreaming of having an audience, he read him two chapters one evening, still in the early days of their acquaintance. The young man listened through to the end without bothering to conceal his boredom and yawning rudely, and didn’t utter a word of praise, but, as he was leaving, asked to borrow the manuscript so that he could form an opinion of it at home at his leisure, and Andrey Antonovich gave it to him. Since then he had not returned the manuscript, even though he dropped in every day, and when questioned about it, his only reply was laughter; in the end, he announced that he had lost it in the street the very day he had borrowed it. When she learned of this, Yuliya Mikhaylovna was dreadfully angry at her husband.","The thing was that from the very first step the young Verkhovensky showed a decided disrespect for Andrei Antonovich, and assumed some strange rights over him, and Yulia Mikhailovna, always so jealous of her husband's significance, simply refused to notice it; at least she attached no importance to it.

Pyotr Stepanovich did not really apologize, but got off with some coarse joke which in other circumstances could have been taken as a new insult, but in the present case was taken as repentance. The weak point lay in Andrei Antonovich's having made a blunder at the very beginning-namely, by imparting his novel to him. Fancying him to be a fervent young man of poetry, and having long dreamed of a listener, one evening, still in the first days of their acquaintance, he read two chapters to him. He listened with unconcealed boredom, yawned impolitely, uttered not a word of praise, but on leaving asked Andrei Antonovich for the manuscript so as to form an opinion at home at his leisure, and Andrei Antonovich gave it to him.

"В городе появилась книгоноша, продававшая Евангелие, почтенная женщина, хотя и из мещанского звания. О ней заговорили, потому что о книгоношах только что появились любопытные отзывы в столичных газетах. Опять тот же плут Лямшин, с помощью одного семинариста, праздношатавшегося в ожидании учительского места в школе, подложил потихоньку книгоноше в мешок, будто бы покупая у нее книги, целую пачку соблазнительных мерзких фотографий из-за границы, нарочно пожертвованных для сего случая, как узнали потом, одним весьма почтенным старичком, фамилию которого опускаю, с важным орденом на шее и любившим, по его выражению, «здоровый смех и веселую шутку». Когда бедная женщина стала вынимать святые книги у нас в Гостином ряду, то посыпались и фотографии. Поднялся смех, ропот; толпа стеснилась, стали ругаться, дошло бы и до побоев, если бы не подоспела полиция. Книгоношу заперли в каталажку, и только вечером, стараниями Маврикия Николаевича, с негодованием узнавшего интимные подробности этой гадкой истории, освободили и выпроводили из города. Тут уж Юлия Михайловна решительно прогнала было Лямшина, но в тот же вечер наши целою компанией привели его к ней, с известием, что он выдумал новую особенную штучку на фортепьяно, и уговорили ее лишь выслушать. Штучка в самом деле оказалась забавною, под смешным названием «Франко-прусская война». Начиналась она грозными звуками «Марсельезы»:","A bookseller appeared in the city, selling the Gospel, a respectable woman, although from a petty-bourgeois rank. They started talking about her, because curious reviews had just appeared about booksellers in the capital's newspapers. Again, the same rogue Lyamshin, with the help of a seminarian who was loitering in anticipation of a teacher's place at school, quietly put the bookseller in a bag, as if buying books from her, a whole bundle of tempting vile photographs from abroad, specially donated for this occasion, as they found out. then, a very respectable old man, whose name I will omit, with an important order around his neck and who loved, in his words, ""a healthy laugh and a cheerful joke."" When the poor woman began to take out the holy books from us in Gostiny Ryad, photographs also fell down. Laughter and murmuring arose; the crowd became embarrassed, they began to swear, and it would have come to beatings if the police had not arrived in time. The bookseller was locked up in a jail, and only in the evening, through the efforts of Mavriky Nikolayevich, who indignantly learned the intimate details of this nasty story, was released and escorted out of the city. At this point, Yulia Mikhailovna resolutely drove Lyamshin away, but on the same evening our whole company brought him to her, with the news that he had invented a new special thing on the pianoforte, and persuaded her only to listen. The thing really turned out to be amusing, under the ridiculous name of the ""Franco-Prussian War."" It began with the menacing sounds of the Marseillaise:","A woman appeared in town selling the Gospels, a respectable woman, albeit in trade. People began talking about her because some curious reports about book-pedlars2 had just appeared in the Petersburg newspapers. Once again the same rogue, Lyamshin, with the help of a seminary student who was just hanging around in anticipation of a teaching position in a school, quietly slipped into the book-pedlar’s bag, as if they were buying books, a whole packet of indecent and obscene photographs from abroad, which had been specifically donated for that purpose, as was subsequently learned, by a quite respectable old gentleman (whose name I am omitting), who wore a high decoration round his neck and who liked, as he put it, ‘healthy laughter and a good joke’. When the poor woman started removing the holy books in our shopping arcade, the photographs fell out as well. There was laughter and murmurs. A crowd gathered round, they began abusing her and she would certainly have been beaten up if the police hadn’t arrived in good time. The book-pedlar was put into the lockup, and only that evening, through the efforts of Mavriky Nikolayevich, who was indignant when he learned the intimate details of this sordid story, was she set free and escorted out of town. At this point Yuliya Mikhaylovna would certainly have banished Lyamshin from her house, but that very evening a whole band of our young people brought him to her, with the news that he had specially composed a new piece for the piano, and they talked her into just giving it a hearing. In fact, the piece did prove entertaining, and bore the amusing title of ‘The Franco-Prussian War’. It began with the menacing strains of the Marseillaise.","An itinerant book-hawker appeared in town selling Gospels, a respectable woman, though of tradesman's rank. She was talked about, because the metropolitan newspapers had just published some curious reports on her kind.2 Again that same rogue, Lyamshin, with the help of some seminarian who was loafing about waiting for a teaching post in the school, while pretending to buy books from her, quietly slipped into her bag a whole bundle of enticing, nasty photographs from abroad, specially donated for the occasion, as was found out later, by a quite venerable old man whose name I shall omit, who had an important decoration around his neck, and who loved, as he put it, ""healthy laughter and a merry joke. "" When the poor woman began taking out her sacred books in the shopping arcade, the photographs spilled out with them. There was laughter, murmuring; the crowd closed in, there was swearing, it would have gone as far as blows if the police had not come in time. The book-hawker was put in the lockup, and only that evening, through the efforts of Mavriky Nikolaevich, who had learned with indignation the intimate details of this vile story, was she freed and sent out of town. This time Yulia Mikhailovna decidedly chased Lyamshin out, but that same evening our entire company brought him to her with the news that he had invented a special new trick on the piano, and talked her into hearing it at least. The trick indeed turned out to be amusing, with the funny title of ""The Franco-Prussian War. "" It began with the fearsome sounds of the ""Marseillaise"":"

"– Вы усмехаетесь иронически. А что, например, говорили вы мне о милостыне? А между тем наслаждение от милостыни есть наслаждение надменное и безнравственное, наслаждение богача своим богатством, властию и сравнением своего значения с значением нищего. Милостыня развращает и подающего и берущего и, сверх того, не достигает цели, потому что только усиливает нищенство. Лентяи, не желающие работать, толпятся около дающих, как игроки у игорного стола, надеясь выиграть. А меж тем жалких грошей, которые им бросают, недостает и на сотую долю. Много ль вы роздали в вашу жизнь? Гривен восемь, не более, припомните-ка. Постарайтесь вспомнить, когда вы подавали в последний раз; года два назад, а пожалуй, четыре будет. Вы кричите и только делу мешаете. Милостыня и в теперешнем обществе должна быть законом запрещена. В новом устройстве совсем не будет бедных.","You smile ironically.

"В нем же я заметил одну важную перемену: он был как будто чем-то слишком уж озабочен, почти серьезен. Обыкновенно он никогда не казался серьезным, всегда смеялся, даже когда злился, а злился он часто. О, он и теперь был зол, говорил грубо, небрежно, с досадой и нетерпением.

"Праздничный день по программе был разделен на две части: на литературное утро, с полудня до четырех, и потом на бал, с девяти часов во всю ночь. Но в самом этом распоряжении уже таились зародыши беспорядка. Во-первых, с самого начала в публике укрепился слух о завтраке, сейчас после литературного утра или даже во время оного, при нарочно устроенном для того перерыве, – о завтраке, разумеется, даровом, входящем в программу, и с шампанским. Огромная цена билета (три рубля) способствовала укоренению слуха. «А то стал бы я по-пустому подписываться? Праздник предполагается сутки, ну и корми. Народ проголодается», – вот как у нас рассуждали. Я должен признаться, что сама же Юлия Михайловна и укоренила этот пагубный слух чрез свое легкомыслие. С месяц назад, еще под первым обаянием великого замысла, она лепетала о своем празднике первому встречному, а о том, что у нее будут провозглашены тосты, послала даже в одну из столичных газет. Ее, главное, прельщали тогда эти тосты: она сама хотела провозгласить их и в ожидании всё сочиняла их. Они должны были разъяснить наше главное знамя (какое? бьюсь об заклад, бедняжка так ничего и не сочинила), перейти в виде корреспонденции в столичные газеты, умилить и очаровать высшее начальство, а затем разлететься по всем губерниям, возбуждая удивление и подражание. Но для тостов необходимо шампанское, а так как шампанское нельзя же пить натощак, то, само собою, необходим стал и завтрак. Потом, когда уже ее усилиями устроился комитет и приступили к делу серьезнее, то ей тотчас же и ясно было доказано, что если мечтать о пирах, то на гувернанток очень мало останется, даже и при богатейшем сборе. Вопрос представил таким образом два исхода: вальтасаровский пир и тосты, и рублей девяносто на гувернанток, или – осуществление значительного сбора при празднике, так сказать, только для формы. Комитет, впрочем, только хотел задать страху, сам же, конечно, придумал третье решение, примиряющее и благоразумное, то есть весьма порядочный праздник во всех отношениях, только без шампанского, и таким образом в остатке сумма весьма приличная, гораздо больше девяноста рублей. Но Юлия Михайловна не согласилась; ее характер презирал мещанскую средину. Она тут же положила, что если первая мысль неосуществима, то немедленно и всецело броситься в обратную крайность, то есть осуществить колоссальный сбор на зависть всем губерниям. «Должна же наконец понять публика, – заключила она свою пламенную комитетскую речь, – что достижение общечеловеческих целей несравненно возвышеннее минутных наслаждений телесных, что праздник в сущности есть только провозглашение великой идеи, а потому должно удовольствоваться самым экономическим, немецким балком, единственно для аллегории и если уж совсем без этого несносного бала обойтись невозможно!» – до того она вдруг возненавидела его. Но ее наконец успокоили. Тогда-то, например, выдумали и предложили «кадриль литературы» и прочие эстетические вещи, для замещения ими наслаждений телесных. Тогда же и Кармазинов окончательно согласился прочесть «Merci» (а до тех пор только томил и мямлил) и тем истребить даже самую идею еды в умах нашей невоздержной публики. Таким образом опять-таки бал становился великолепнейшим торжеством, хотя и не в том уже роде. А чтобы не уходить совсем в облака, решили, что в начале бала можно будет подать чаю с лимоном и кругленьким печением, потом оршад и лимонад, а под конец даже и мороженое, но и только. Для тех же, которые непременно всегда и везде ощущают голод и, главное, жажду, – можно открыть в конце анфилады комнат особый буфет, которым и займется Прохорыч (главный клубный повар), и – впрочем, под строжайшим надзором комитета – будет подавать, что угодно, но за особую плату, а для того нарочно объявить в дверях залы надписью, что буфет – вне программы. Но утром положили совсем не открывать буфета, чтобы не помешать чтению, несмотря на то что буфет назначался за пять комнат до белой залы, в которой Кармазинов согласился прочесть «Merci». Любопытно, что этому событию, то есть чтению «Merci», кажется придали в комитете слишком уже колоссальное значение, и даже самые практические люди. Что же до людей поэтических, то предводительша, например, объявила Кармазинову, что она после чтения велит тотчас же вделать в стену своей белой залы мраморную доску с золотою надписью, что такого-то числа и года, здесь, на сем месте, великий русский и европейский писатель, кладя перо, прочел «Merci» и таким образом в первый раз простился с русскою публикой в лице представителей нашего города, и что эту надпись все уже прочтут на бале, то есть всего только пять часов спустя после того, как будет прочитано «Merci». Я наверно знаю, что Кармазинов-то, главное, и потребовал, чтобы буфета утром не было, пока он будет читать, ни под каким видом, несмотря на замечания иных комитетских, что это не совсем в наших нравах.","The festive day according to the program was divided into two parts: a literary morning, from noon to four, and then a ball, from nine o'clock all night. But in this order itself, the germs of disorder were already lurking. Firstly, from the very beginning, the rumor about breakfast, now after a literary morning, or even during it, with a break specially arranged for that, was strengthened in the public - about a breakfast, of course, free of charge, included in the program, and with champagne. The huge ticket price (three rubles) contributed to the rooting of the rumor. “And then I would have signed in an empty way? The holiday is supposed to be a day, well, feed. The people will get hungry, ”that’s how we reasoned. I must confess that it was Yulia Mikhailovna herself who planted this pernicious rumor through her frivolity. About a month ago, still under the first charm of a great plan, she babbled about her holiday to the first person she met, and even sent to one of the metropolitan newspapers that toasts would be proclaimed at her place. Most importantly, these toasts seduced her then: she herself wanted to proclaim them and, in anticipation, kept composing them. They were supposed to explain our main banner (which one? I bet the poor thing never invented anything), go in the form of correspondence to the capital's newspapers, touch and charm the top authorities, and then scatter over all the provinces, arousing surprise and imitation. But champagne is necessary for toasting, and since champagne cannot be drunk on an empty stomach, then, of course, breakfast became necessary. Later, when a committee had already been established through her efforts and the matter began more seriously, it was immediately and clearly proved to her that if you dream of feasts, then there will be very little left for governesses, even with the richest gathering. The question thus presented two outcomes: the Belshazzar feast and toasts, and ninety rubles for governesses, or the implementation of a significant collection at the feast, so to speak, only for the form. The committee, however, only wanted to give fear, but of course, they themselves came up with a third solution, reconciling and prudent, that is, a very respectable holiday in all respects, only without champagne, and thus the balance is a very decent amount, much more than ninety rubles. But Yulia Mikhailovna did not agree; her character despised the philistine middle. She immediately decided that if the first idea was unrealizable, then immediately and completely rush to the opposite extreme, that is, to carry out a colossal collection to the envy of all the provinces. “The public must finally understand,” she concluded her fiery committee speech, “that the achievement of universal human goals is incomparably more sublime than momentary bodily pleasures, that a holiday in essence is only the proclamation of a great idea, and therefore must be content with the most economic, German beam, solely for allegory and if it’s impossible to do without this unbearable ball!” Before that, she suddenly hated him. But she was finally calmed down. It was then, for example, that they invented and proposed the “quadrille of literature” and other aesthetic things to replace bodily pleasures with them. At the same time, Karmazinov finally agreed to read Merci (and until then he had only languished and mumbled) and thereby destroy even the very idea of food in the minds of our intemperate public. Thus, again, the ball became a most magnificent celebration, although not in the same way. And in order not to go completely into the clouds, we decided that at the beginning of the ball it would be possible to serve tea with lemon and round cookies, then orchad and lemonade, and at the end even ice cream, but that's all. For those who certainly always and everywhere feel hungry and, most importantly, thirsty, you can open a special buffet at the end of the suite of rooms, which Prokhorych (the head club cook) will take care of, and - however, under the strict supervision of the committee - will serve what anything, but for a special fee, and in order to purposely announce at the door of the hall with an inscription that the buffet is out of the program. But in the morning they decided not to open the cupboard at all so as not to interfere with reading, despite the fact that the buffet was appointed five rooms before the white room, in which Karmazinov agreed to read Merci. It is curious that this event, that is, the reading of ""Merci"", seems to have been given too colossal significance in the committee, even by the most practical people. As for the people of poetry, the leader, for example, announced to Karmazinov that after reading she would immediately put a marble plaque with a gold inscription into the wall of her white hall, saying that on such and such a date and year, here, in this place, the great Russian and the European writer, laying down his pen, read ""Merci"" and thus for the first time said goodbye to the Russian public in the person of the representatives of our city, and that everyone would already read this inscription at the ball, that is, only five hours after it was read "" Mercy. I probably know that Karmazinov, the main thing, demanded that there be no buffet in the morning while he was reading, under no circumstances, despite the remarks of other committee members that this was not entirely in our manners.","According to the programme, the festive day was divided into two parts: a literary matinee,4 from noon until four, and then a ball, from ten o’clock on through the night. But this particular arrangement already contained the seeds of disorder. In the first place, from the very beginning a rumour had become firmly established among the public that there would be a luncheon immediately after the literary matinee or even during it, with an interval devoted expressly to it — a free luncheon, naturally, which would be part of the programme, and with champagne. The enormous cost of the ticket (three roubles) helped confirm the rumour. ‘As if I would subscribe for nothing? The gala is supposed to go on for twenty-four hours, so they’ll feed us; people will get hungry’ — that’s how people reasoned. I must confess that Yuliya Mikhaylovna herself was responsible for implanting this pernicious rumour through her own heedlessness. About a month earlier, while under the initial spell of her great plan, she was babbling about her gala to anyone she happened to meet, and she even sent a notice to one of the newspapers in the capital about the toasts that would be proposed for the occasion. She was then mainly attracted by the idea of these toasts; she herself wanted to propose them and kept composing them in anticipation. They were to elucidate our main motto (what was it? I’ll bet the poor lady hadn’t composed anything at all), which would then go to the newspapers in the two capitals as coming from a provincial correspondent, intrigue and fascinate the higher authorities, and then spread throughout all the provinces, inspiring wonderment and emulation. But for toasts champagne is necessary, and since it’s impossible to drink champagne on an empty stomach, then, it went without saying, luncheon became necessary as well. Later, when a committee was formed through her efforts and the matter was addressed more seriously, then it was immediately and clearly proved to her that if they were to think of banquets, very little would be left for the governesses, even if the collection were very large. And so there were two ways out of the problem: either a Belshazzar’s feast5 with toasts, and about ninety roubles for the governesses, or the raising of a substantial sum of money, with the gala only a matter of form, so to speak. The committee, however, only wanted to give her a scare, and of course devised a third solution, which reconciled the first two and was reasonable, that is, a very decent gala in all respects, only without champagne, and therefore with a very respectable sum remaining, much more than ninety roubles. But Yuliya Mikhaylovna didn’t agree; by nature she despised the philistine middle way. She proposed forthwith that if the first idea couldn’t be realized, then they should rush to the opposite extreme immediately and wholeheartedly, that is, raise an enormous subscription that would be the envy of all the other provinces. ‘The public really must understand once and for all,’ she concluded her fiery speech to the committee, ‘that the achievement of universal human goals is incomparably loftier than ephemeral corporeal pleasures; that the gala in essence is only the proclamation of a great idea, and one therefore ought to be content with the most economical little German ball, merely as a symbol, and only if we can’t dispense with this intolerable ball altogether!’ —so great was the hatred she had suddenly conceived for it. But they finally calmed her down. It was then, for instance, that they finally devised and proposed a ‘literary quadrille’ and other aesthetic things as substitutes for corporeal pleasures. It was then that Karmazinov finally and definitely agreed to read ‘Merci’ (until then he had been tormenting them with his shilly-shallying), thereby eradicating the very idea of food in the minds of our irrepressible public. And so it was that the ball once more became a magnificent triumph, although not in the same way. And to avoid floating off into the clouds altogether, they decided that tea with lemon and small round biscuits could be served at the beginning of the ball, then orgeat6 and lemonade, and towards the end even ice cream, but that was all. And for those who were always, everywhere and invariably hungry, and, most importantly, thirsty, a special buffet would be opened at the end of a suite of rooms, and Prokhorych (the head chef at the club) would be in charge of it, and — though under the strictest supervision of the committee — anything anyone liked would be served, but for a separate price, and for that purpose a notice would be posted on the doors of the hall, to the effect that the buffet was not included in the programme. But in the morning they decided not to open the buffet at all, so as not to disturb the reading, even though the buffet was to be located five rooms away from the White Hall, where Karmazinov had agreed to read ‘Merci’. It was curious that enormous significance seemed to have been attached to this event by the committee, that is, to the reading of ‘Merci’, and by even its most practical members. And as far as the poetic people were concerned, the wife of the marshal of the nobility, for one, informed Karmazinov that after the reading she would immediately order a marble plaque fixed to the wall of her White Hall, with a gold inscription that read that on such-and-such a date in such-and-such year, here, on this very spot, a great Russian and European writer, on laying down his pen, had read ‘Merci’, and thereby had for the first time taken leave of the Russian public in the persons of the representatives of our town, and that everyone could then read this inscription at the ball, that is, a mere five hours after the reading of ‘Merci’. I know for a fact that it was mainly Karmazinov who demanded that under no circumstances should there be a buffet that morning, while he was reading, despite observations from some members of the committee to the effect that this was not quite our way of doing things.","According to the program, the festive day was divided into two parts: the literary matinée, from noon till four, and then the ball, from nine o'clock on through the night. But this arrangement itself concealed germs of disorder. First, from the very beginning a rumor established itself among the public about a luncheon right after the literary matinée, or even during it, with a break especially arranged for that purpose-a free luncheon, naturally, as part of the program, and with champagne. The enormous price of the ticket (three roubles) contributed to this rumor's taking root. "" Because why should I subscribe for nothing? The fête is supposed to go on round the clock, so they'll have to feed us. People will get hungry""-thus the reasoning went. I must admit that it was Yulia Mikhailovna herself who planted this pernicious rumor through her own light-mindedness. About a month earlier, still under the initial enchantment of the grand design, she had babbled about her fête with whoever happened along, and about the fact that toasts would be proposed she had even sent a notice to one of the metropolitan newspapers. She had been seduced mainly by these toasts then: she wanted to propose them herself, and kept devising them in anticipation. They were to explain our chief banner (what banner? I bet the poor dear never devised anything), to be passed on in the form of reports to the metropolitan newspapers, to touch and charm the higher authorities, and then to go winging over all the provinces, arousing astonishment and imitation. But for toasts champagne was necessary, and since one could not really drink champagne on an empty stomach, a luncheon, of itself, also became necessary. Later, when through her efforts a committee had been formed and they got down to business more seriously, it was proved to her at once and clearly that if one were dreaming of banquets, very little would be left for the governesses, even with the most abundant collection. The question thus presented two solutions: either a Belshazzar's feast4 with toasts and about ninety roubles left for the governesses, or the realization of a significant collection, with the fête being, so to speak, only for form. The committee only wanted to give her a scare, however, and, of course, came up with a third solution, conciliatory and sensible-that is, quite a proper fête in all respects, only without champagne, and thus with quite a decent sum as a balance, much more than ninety roubles. But Yulia Mikhailovna did not agree; her character despised the philistine middle. She resolved then and there, since the first idea was unfeasible, to rush immediately and entirely to the opposite extreme-that is, to realize a colossal collection that would be the envy of all the provinces. ""For the public must finally understand,"" she concluded her fiery committee speech, ""that the achievement of universal human goals is incomparably loftier than momentary physical pleasures, that the fête is essentially only a proclamation of the great idea, and therefore one must be content with the most economical little German ball, solely as an allegory, since it's impossible to do without this obnoxious ball altogether!""-so much did she suddenly hate it. But she was finally calmed down. It was then, for example, that they thought up and suggested the ""quadrille of literature"" and other aesthetic things to replace physical pleasures. It was then, too, that Karmazinov finally agreed to read Merci (until then he had only hemmed and hawed), and thereby annihilate even the very idea of food in the minds of our incontinent public. In this way the ball was again becoming a most magnificent festivity, though no longer of the same sort. And so as not to go soaring off completely into the clouds, it was decided that at the beginning of the ball they would serve tea with lemon and little round cookies, then orgeat and lemonade, and lastly even ice cream, but that was all. For those who, always and everywhere, inevitably feel hungry and, above all, thirsty-a special buffet would be opened at the far end of the suite of rooms, to be taken charge of by Prokhorych (the head cook at the club), who-though under strict supervision by the committee-would serve whatever anyone liked, but for a separate price, and to that end a written announcement would be posted at the door of the reception hall that the buffet was outside the program. But for the matinée they decided not to open the buffet at all, so as not to interfere with the reading, even though the buffet would be located five rooms away from the white hall in which Karmazinov had consented to read Merci. Curiously, it seems this event-that is, the reading of Merci-was seen by the committee as being all too colossally significant, and even by the most practical people. As for the more poetical people, the wife of the marshal of nobility announced to Karmazinov, for instance, that after the reading she would at once order a marble plaque to be fixed to the wall of her white hall with an inscription in gold saying that on such-and-such a day and year, here, on this spot, the great Russian and European writer, as he laid down his pen, read Merci and thus for the first time bade farewell to the Russian public in the persons of the representatives of our town, and that everyone would be able to read this inscription at the ball, that is, only five hours after Merci was read. I know for certain that it was chiefly Karmazinov who demanded that there be no buffet at the matinée, while he was reading, on any account whatsoever, despite the remarks of some committee members that this was not quite our way of doing things."

"Это была светлая, довольно чистая крестьянская изба в три окна и в две комнаты; и не то что постоялый двор, а так приезжая изба, в которой по старой привычке останавливались знакомые проезжие. Степан Трофимович, не конфузясь, прошел в передний угол, забыл поздороваться, уселся и задумался. Между тем чрезвычайно приятное ощущение тепла после трехчасовой сырости на дороге вдруг разлилось по его телу. Даже самый озноб, коротко и отрывисто забегавший по спине его, как это всегда бывает в лихорадке с особенно нервными людьми, при внезапном переходе с холода в тепло, стал ему вдруг как-то странно приятен. Он поднял голову, и сладостный запах горячих блинов, над которыми старалась у печки хозяйка, защекотал его обоняние. Улыбаясь ребячьею улыбкой, он потянулся к хозяйке и вдруг залепетал:","It was a bright, fairly clean peasant hut with three windows and two rooms; and not just an inn, but a visiting hut, in which, out of old habit, familiar travelers stopped. Stepan Trofimovich, without embarrassment, went to the front corner, forgot to say hello, sat down and thought. Meanwhile, an extremely pleasant sensation of warmth after three hours of dampness on the road suddenly spread over his body. Even the chill itself, which ran briefly and abruptly down his back, as it always happens in a fever with especially nervous people, at a sudden transition from cold to warmth, suddenly became somehow strangely pleasant to him. He raised his head, and the sweet smell of hot pancakes, over which the hostess tried at the stove, tickled his sense of smell. Smiling with a childish smile, he reached out to the hostess and suddenly stammered:","It was a bright, rather clean peasant hut with three windows and two rooms; it wasn’t so much a coaching inn as a hut for travellers, where, by ancient custom, acquaintances passing through would stay.

"Действительно, Варвара Петровна наверно и весьма часто его ненавидела; но он одного только в ней не приметил до самого конца, того, что стал наконец для нее ее сыном, ее созданием, даже, можно сказать, ее изобретением, стал плотью от плоти ее, и что она держит и содержит его вовсе не из одной только «зависти к его талантам». И как, должно быть, она была оскорбляема такими предположениями! В ней таилась какая-то нестерпимая любовь к нему, среди беспрерывной ненависти, ревности и презрения. Она охраняла его от каждой пылинки, нянчилась с ним двадцать два года, не спала бы целых ночей от заботы, если бы дело коснулось до его репутации поэта, ученого, гражданского деятеля. Она его выдумала и в свою выдумку сама же первая и уверовала. Он был нечто вроде какой-то ее мечты… Но она требовала от него за это действительно многого, иногда даже рабства. Злопамятна же была до невероятности.

"Как уже сказано, почти все стояли и ничего не делали, кроме отчасти Толкаченки и Эркеля. Виргинский хотя и бросился, когда все бросились, к Шатову, но за Шатова не схватился и держать его не помогал. Лямшин же очутился в кучке уже после выстрела. Затем все они в продолжение всей этой, может быть десятиминутной, возни с трупом как бы потеряли часть своего сознания. Они сгруппировались кругом и, прежде всякого беспокойства и тревоги, ощущали как бы лишь одно удивление, Липутин стоял впереди, у самого трупа. Виргинский – сзади его, выглядывая из-за его плеча с каким-то особенным и как бы посторонним любопытством, даже приподнимаясь на цыпочки, чтобы лучше разглядеть. Лямшин же спрятался за Виргинского и только изредка и опасливо из-за него выглядывал и тотчас же опять прятался. Когда же камни были подвязаны, а Петр Степанович приподнялся, Виргинский вдруг задрожал весь мелкою дрожью, сплеснул руками и горестно воскликнул во весь голос:","As already mentioned, almost everyone stood and did nothing, except to some extent Tolkachenko and Erkel. Although Virginsky rushed when everyone rushed to Shatov, he did not grab Shatov and did not help to hold him. Lyamshin found himself in a pile after the shot. Then all of them, in the course of all this, maybe ten minutes, fussing with the corpse, as it were, lost part of their consciousness. They grouped themselves in a circle and, before any restlessness and alarm, they felt, as it were, only one surprise, Liputin was standing in front, by the very corpse. Virginsky is behind him, peering over his shoulder with a kind of special and, as it were, extraneous curiosity, even rising on tiptoe to get a better look. Lyamshin hid behind Virginsky and only occasionally and cautiously looked out from behind him and immediately hid again. When the stones were tied up, and Pyotr Stepanovich got up, Virginsky suddenly began to tremble all over, clasped his hands, and exclaimed mournfully at the top of his voice:","As has already been said, almost all of them were standing and doing nothing, with the partial exception of Tolkachenko and Erkel. Although Virginsky rushed at Shatov when all the others did, he didn’t grab Shatov and didn’t help hold him down. As for Lyamshin, he joined the group only after the shot had been fired. Then during the entire course of this fussing with the corpse, which lasted perhaps ten minutes, they all seemed to be only partially conscious. They grouped themselves around and rather than any uneasiness or alarm, seemed to feel nothing but surprise. Liputin was standing in front, right by the corpse. Virginsky was behind him, peering over his shoulder with peculiar and seemingly detached curiosity, even standing on tiptoe to have a better look. And Lyamshin had hidden behind Virginsky and would peer out from behind him occasionally and apprehensively, and then immediately hide himself again.

"Nicolas пролежал с лишком два месяца. Из Москвы был выписан известный врач для консилиума; весь город посетил Варвару Петровну. Она простила. Когда, к весне, Nicolas совсем уже выздоровел и, без всякого возражения, согласился на предложение мамаши съездить в Италию, то она же и упросила его сделать всем у нас прощальные визиты и при этом, сколько возможно и где надо, извиниться. Nicolas согласился с большою охотой. В клубе известно было, что он имел с Павлом Павловичем Гагановым деликатнейшее объяснение у того в доме, которым тот остался совершенно доволен. Разъезжая по визитам, Nicolas был очень серьезен и несколько даже мрачен. Все приняли его, по-видимому, с полным участием, но все почему-то конфузились и рады были тому, что он уезжает в Италию. Иван Осипович даже прослезился, но почему-то не решился обнять его даже и при последнем прощании.

Driving around on visits, Nicolas was very serious and even somewhat gloomy. Everyone accepted him, apparently with full participation, but for some reason everyone was embarrassed and were glad that he was leaving for Italy.

Nicolas very willingly agreed. It became known at the club that he had gone to Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov’s house for a highly delicate talk, with which the latter was fully satisfied. As he made his rounds of visits, Nicolas was very serious and even somewhat morose. All seemed to receive him with complete sympathy, but all for some reason felt embarrassed and were glad that he was leaving for Italy. Ivan Osipovich’s eyes even brimmed with tears, but for some reason he made no move to embrace him even at their final leave-taking. To be sure, some of us remained firmly convinced that this good-for-nothing had simply been making fun of us, and that his illness had nothing to do with it. He went round to see Liputin as well.","Nicolas spent more than two months in bed. A famous doctor was invited from Moscow for consultation; the whole town came to call on Varvara Petrovna. Forgiveness was granted. Towards spring, when Nicolas had completely recovered and had assented without any objections to his mother's proposal that he go to Italy, she also persuaded him to pay farewell visits to everyone and, while doing so, to make apologies as far as possible and wherever necessary. Nicolas assented quite readily. It became known in the club that he had a most delicate talk with Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov in his own home, which left the man perfectly satisfied. Going around on his visits, Nicolas was very serious, even somewhat gloomy. Everyone received him, apparently, with complete sympathy, but everyone was also embarrassed for some reason and glad that he was going to Italy. Ivan Osipovich even shed a tear, but for some reason did not dare to embrace him even at this final parting. Indeed, some among us remained convinced that the scoundrel was simply laughing at us all, and that his illness was beside the point. He also stopped by at Liputin's."

"Началось с того, что мы со Степаном Трофимовичем, явившись к Варваре Петровне ровно в двенадцать часов, как она назначила, не застали ее дома; она еще не возвращалась от обедни. Бедный друг мой был так настроен, или, лучше сказать, так расстроен, что это обстоятельство тотчас же сразило его: почти в бессилии опустился он на кресло в гостиной. Я предложил ему стакан воды; но, несмотря на бледность свою и даже на дрожь в руках, он с достоинством отказался. Кстати, костюм его отличался на этот раз необыкновенною изысканностию: почти бальное, батистовое с вышивкой белье, белый галстук, новая шляпа в руках, свежие соломенного цвета перчатки и даже, чуть-чуть, духи. Только что мы уселись, вошел Шатов, введенный камердинером, ясное дело, тоже по официальному приглашению. Степан Трофимович привстал было протянуть ему руку, но Шатов, посмотрев на нас обоих внимательно, поворотил в угол, уселся там и даже не кивнул нам головой. Степан Трофимович опять испуганно поглядел на меня.","It began with the fact that Stepan Trofimovich and I, having appeared at Varvara Petrovna's exactly at twelve o'clock, as she had appointed, did not find her at home; she had not yet returned from mass. My poor friend was in such a mood, or, rather, so upset, that this circumstance immediately overwhelmed him: almost helplessly, he sank into an armchair in the drawing room. I offered him a glass of water; but, in spite of his pallor and even the trembling of his hands, he refused with dignity. By the way, this time his costume was distinguished by extraordinary refinement: almost ballroom, batiste linen with embroidery, a white tie, a new hat in his hands, fresh straw-colored gloves, and even a little bit of perfume. As soon as we sat down, Shatov entered, introduced by the valet, of course, also at the official invitation. Stepan Trofimovich got up to stretch out his hand to him, but Shatov, looking at both of us attentively, turned into a corner, sat down there, and did not even nod his head to us. Stepan Trofimovich again looked at me in fright.","It began when Stepan Trofimovich and I appeared at Varvara Petrovna’s at precisely twelve o’clock, the time appointed by her, and didn’t find her at home. She hadn’t yet returned from mass. My poor friend was so arranged, or, better said, so deranged that he was immediately crushed by this circumstance. In a state of virtual collapse he sank into an armchair in the drawing room. I offered him a glass of water; but despite his pallor and even a tremor in his hands, he proudly declined it. By the way, his outfit on this occasion was remarkable for its extraordinary good taste: an embroidered cambric shirt that almost looked destined for a fancy-dress ball, a white tie, a new hat in his hands, gloves the colour of fresh straw, and even the faintest hint of scent. We had no sooner sat down when in came Shatov, escorted by the butler, and obviously by official invitation. Stepan Trofimovich half-rose to extend his hand, but Shatov, after a close look at both of us, turned away into a corner, sat down there and didn’t even nod his head. Stepan Trofimovich bestowed another frightened glance on me.","It all began when Stepan Trofimovich and I, having come to Varvara Petrovna's at exactly twelve o'clock, as she herself had stipulated, did not find her at home; she had not yet returned from the Sunday liturgy.

I offered him a glass of water; but, despite his paleness and even the trembling of his hands, he declined it with dignity. Incidentally, his outfit this time was distinguished by its remarkable elegance: a shirt almost fit for a ball, cambric, embroidered, a white tie, a new hat in his hand, fresh straw-colored gloves, and even just a touch of perfume.

"Наконец произошло объяснение и с губернатором. Милый, мягкий наш Иван Осипович только что воротился и только что успел выслушать горячую клубную жалобу. Без сомнения, надо было что-нибудь сделать, но он смутился. Гостеприимный наш старичок тоже как будто побаивался своего молодого родственника. Он решился, однако, склонить его извиниться пред клубом и пред обиженным, но в удовлетворительном виде, и если потребуется, то и письменно; а затем мягко уговорить его нас оставить, уехав, например, для любознательности в Италию и вообще куда-нибудь за границу. В зале, куда вышел он принять на этот раз Николая Всеволодовича (в другие разы прогуливавшегося, на правах родственника, по всему дому невозбранно), воспитанный Алеша Телятников, чиновник, а вместе с тем и домашний у губернатора человек, распечатывал в углу у стола пакеты; а в следующей комнате, у ближайшего к дверям залы окна, поместился один заезжий, толстый и здоровый полковник, друг и бывший сослуживец Ивана Осиповича, и читал «Голос», разумеется, не обращая никакого внимания на то, что происходило в зале; даже и сидел спиной. Иван Осипович заговорил отдаленно, почти шепотом, но всё несколько путался. Nicolas смотрел очень нелюбезно, совсем не по-родственному, был бледен, сидел потупившись и слушал сдвинув брови, как будто преодолевая сильную боль.","Finally there was an explanation with the governor. Our dear, gentle Ivan Osipovich has just returned and has just had time to listen to the heated complaint of the club. No doubt something should have been done, but he was embarrassed. Our hospitable old man also seemed to be afraid of his young relative. He decided, however, to persuade him to apologize to the club and to the offended, but in a satisfactory form, and if necessary, in writing; and then gently persuade him to leave us, leaving, for example, for curiosity in Italy and generally somewhere abroad. In the hall, where he went out this time to receive Nikolai Vsevolodovich (on other occasions he walked, as a relative, throughout the house unrestrictedly), Alyosha Telyatnikov, an educated official, and at the same time a household man with the governor, unpacked packets in the corner at the table ; and in the next room, at the window closest to the doors of the hall, there was a visiting, fat and healthy colonel, a friend and former colleague of Ivan Osipovich, and read ""Voice"", of course, not paying any attention to what was happening in the hall; I even sat on my back. Ivan Osipovich spoke distantly, almost in a whisper, but he was still somewhat confused. Nicolas looked very unkindly, not at all like a relative, he was pale, sat looking down and listened with his eyebrows drawn together, as if overcoming severe pain.","At last the talk with the governor took place as well. Our dear, mild Ivan Osipovich had just returned and had just had time to hear the heated complaint from the club. There was no doubt that something had to be done, but he was in a state of confusion.

However, he finally resolved to prevail on him to apologize to the club and to the man he’d insulted, but in satisfactory form, and, if required, in writing as well; and then gently persuade him to leave us, travelling, for example, to Italy for self-improvement, and in general anywhere abroad. In the reception room, where on this occasion he emerged to greet Nikolay Vsevolodovich (who on other occasions, in keeping with his rights as a relative, had been entitled to wander unrestricted through the entire house), Alyosha Telyatnikov, a well-bred clerk, and at the same time a member of the governor’s household, was sitting at a table in the corner unsealing envelopes, and in the next room, by the window closest to the door of the reception room, a visitor had installed himself, a stout, healthy-looking colonel, a friend and former colleague of Ivan Osipovich, who was reading the Voice,7 without of course paying the slightest attention to what was going on in the reception room; he was even sitting with his back turned. Ivan Osipovich began speaking circuitously, almost in a whisper, but kept getting somewhat muddled. Nicolas looked very unobliging, not at all as a relative should; he was pale, sat with his eyes fastened on the floor and listened with knitted brows, as if trying to overcome an acute pain.","The talk with the governor also finally took place.

"Но та едва повернула к нему голову, несмотря на то что с полчаса назад была ошеломлена при первом его появлении. Теперь же у ней были новые хлопоты: с самого того мгновения, как вышел капитан и столкнулся в дверях с Николаем Всеволодовичем, Лиза вдруг принялась смеяться, – сначала тихо, порывисто, но смех разрастался всё более и более, громче и явственнее. Она раскраснелась. Контраст с ее недавним мрачным видом был чрезвычайный. Пока Николай Всеволодович разговаривал с Варварой Петровной, она раза два поманила к себе Маврикия Николаевича, будто желая ему что-то шепнуть; но лишь только тот наклонялся к ней, мигом заливалась смехом; можно было заключить, что она именно над бедным Маврикием Николаевичем и смеется.

"– И это точь-в-точь так, – опять громко и без церемонии обратился ко мне Шатов, – она его третирует совсем как лакея; сам я слышал, как она кричала ему: «Лебядкин, подай воды», и при этом хохотала; в том только разница, что он не бежит за водой, а бьет ее за это; но она нисколько его не боится. У ней какие-то припадки нервные, чуть не ежедневные, и ей память отбивают, так что она после них всё забывает, что сейчас было, и всегда время перепутывает. Вы думаете, она помнит, как мы вошли; может, и помнит, но уж наверно переделала всё по-своему и нас принимает теперь за каких-нибудь иных, чем мы есть, хоть и помнит, что я Шатушка.

"Едва только он выпрямился после того, как так позорно качнулся на бок, чуть не на целую половину роста, от полученной пощечины, и не затих еще, казалось, в комнате подлый, как бы мокрый какой-то звук от удара кулака по лицу, как тотчас же он схватил Шатова обеими руками за плечи; но тотчас же, в тот же почти миг, отдернул свои обе руки назад и скрестил их у себя за спиной. Он молчал, смотрел на Шатова и бледнел как рубашка. Но странно, взор его как бы погасал. Через десять секунд глаза его смотрели холодно и – я убежден, что не лгу, – спокойно. Только бледен он был ужасно. Разумеется, я не знаю, что было внутри человека, я видел снаружи. Мне кажется, если бы был такой человек, который схватил бы, например, раскаленную докрасна железную полосу и зажал в руке, с целию измерить свою твердость, и затем, в продолжение десяти секунд, побеждал бы нестерпимую боль и кончил тем, что ее победил, то человек этот, кажется мне, вынес бы нечто похожее на то, что испытал теперь, в эти десять секунд, Николай Всеволодович.","As soon as he straightened up after he so shamefully swayed on his side, almost a whole half of his height, from the received slap in the face, and still did not subside, it seemed that in the room there was a vile, as if wet, sound from a blow of a fist in the face, as he immediately grabbed Shatov by the shoulders with both hands; but at once, almost at the same instant, he drew back both his hands and crossed them behind his back. He was silent, looked at Shatov and turned pale as a shirt. But strangely, his eyes seemed to fade. Ten seconds later his eyes were cold and—I'm sure I'm not lying—calm. Only he was terribly pale. Of course, I do not know what was inside a person, I saw outside. It seems to me that if there were such a person who would grab, for example, a red-hot iron strip and hold it in his hand, in order to measure his hardness, and then, in the course of ten seconds, would overcome unbearable pain and end up defeating it, then this man, it seems to me, would endure something similar to what Nikolai Vsevolodovich experienced now, in these ten seconds.","Scarcely had he regained his balance after the shame of reeling to one side, almost halfway to the floor, from the slap he had been dealt, and scarcely had the humiliating, sodden-sounding blow of the fist in his face died away, when he immediately grabbed Shatov by the shoulders with both hands; but immediately, at virtually the same instant, he jerked both his hands away and crossed them behind his back. He said nothing, but merely looked at Shatov, and turned white as a sheet. But strangely enough, the light in his eyes seemed to be going out. Ten seconds later his eyes had a cold and (I’m sure I’m not lying) calm look to them. The only thing going on was that he was dreadfully pale. Naturally, I don’t know what was inside the man, I could see only the outside. It seems to me that if there were a man, for example, who would seize a red-hot iron bar and squeeze it in his hand in order to test his toughness, and then, for a whole ten seconds had tried to overcome the unbearable pain and ended by overcoming it, then this man, it seems to me, would have endured something like what Nikolay Vsevolodovich experienced for these ten seconds.","As soon as he straightened up, after having swayed so disgracefully to one side, almost as much as half his height, from the slap he had received, and before the mean, somehow as if wet, sound of a fist hitting a face seemed to have faded away in the room, he immediately seized Shatov by the shoulders with both hands; but immediately, at almost the same moment, he jerked both hands back and clasped them behind him. He said nothing, looked at Shatov, and turned pale as a shirt. But, strangely, his eyes seemed to be dying out. Ten seconds later his look was cold and-I'm convinced I'm not lying-calm.

I also ask you to consider that, despite the extraordinary firmness of her soul and a significant share of reason and practical, so to speak, even economic, tact that she possessed, all the same, in her life there were no such moments that she suddenly gave herself completely, completely and, if I may say so, absolutely without restraint. Finally, I ask you to take into account that the present moment could really be for her one of those in which, suddenly, as if in a focus, the whole essence of life is concentrated - everything lived, everything present and, perhaps, the future. Let me also mention in passing the anonymous letter she received, about which she had so irritably let slip to Praskovya Ivanovna just now, and, it seems, kept silent about the further content of the letter; and in it, perhaps, lay the clue to the possibility of that terrible question with which she suddenly turned to her son.","But in order to explain the dreadful question that suddenly followed this gesture and this exclamation — a question whose implications I could not have imagined even Varvara Petrovna capable of — I will ask the reader to remember the kind of character Varvara Petrovna had possessed her whole life long, and her exceptional impulsiveness at other extraordinary moments. I will also ask the reader to consider that, despite her exceptional firmness of character and the large grain of common sense and practical, even, so to speak, managerial shrewdness that she possessed, still and all her life was not yet completely free of the kind of moments to which she suddenly abandoned herself entirely, wholly and, if I may so express myself, utterly without restraint. Finally, I ask you to take into consideration that the present moment might actually have been for her one of those in which the entire essence of her life — everything that had been experienced, the entire present, and perhaps the future — was concentrated and focused. I will again mention in passing the anonymous letter she had received, and which she had earlier let slip about to Praskovya Ivanovna, in such a state of irritation, while saying nothing, I think, about what else was contained in the letter; and that perhaps was where the answer lay to the riddle of how she could possibly ask the dreadful question that she now suddenly put to her son.","But to explain the terrible question that suddenly followed this gesture and exclamation-a question I could not have supposed possible even in Varvara Petrovna herself-I shall ask the reader to recall what Varvara Petrovna's character had been all her life and the remarkable impetuousness she had shown in certain extraordinary moments. I also ask him to bear in mind that, despite the remarkable firmness of soul and the considerable amount of reason, and of practical, even, so to speak, managerial tact she possessed, there was no lack of moments in her life in which she would give all of herself suddenly, entirely, and, if it is permissible to say so, totally without restraint. I also ask him, finally, to consider that for her the present moment could indeed have been one of those in which the whole essence of a life-all that has been lived through, all the present, and perhaps the future-is suddenly focused. I shall also remind him in passing of the anonymous letter she had received, as she had just so irritably let on to Praskovya Ivanovna, though I think she kept silent about the further contents of the letter; and precisely in it, perhaps, lay the key to the possibility of that terrible question which she suddenly addressed to her son."

"Степан Трофимович уселся в кресла, еще среди остававшегося беспорядка. В передних рядах его, видимо, встретили нерасположенные взгляды. (В клубе его в последнее время как-то перестали любить и гораздо меньше прежнего уважали). Впрочем, и то уж было хорошо, что не шикали. Странная была у меня идея еще со вчерашнего дня: мне всё казалось, что его тотчас же освищут, лишь только он покажется. А между тем его не сейчас даже и приметили за некоторым остававшимся беспорядком. И на что мог надеяться этот человек, если уж с Кармазиновым так поступили? Он был бледен; десять лет не являлся он пред публикой.

In the front ranks, he was apparently met with unwilling glances. (In the club, they somehow stopped loving him recently and respected him much less than before). However, even then it was good that they did not hiss. I've had a strange idea since the day before: it always seemed to me that they would immediately boo him as soon as he showed himself. And meanwhile, he was not even noticed right now for some of the remaining mess. And what could this person hope for, if they did this to Karmazinov? He was pale; for ten years he did not appear before the public. From the excitement and everything that was all too familiar to me in him, it was clear to me that he himself looked at his present appearance on the stage as a decision of his fate, or something like that.

"Он бы, может быть, и еще что-нибудь прибавил к своему столь позднему восклицанию, но Лямшин ему не дал докончить: вдруг и изо всей силы обхватил он и сжал его сзади и завизжал каким-то невероятным визгом. Бывают сильные моменты испуга, например когда человек вдруг закричит не своим голосом, а каким-то таким, какого и предположить в нем нельзя было раньше, и это бывает иногда даже очень страшно. Лямшин закричал не человеческим, а каким-то звериным голосом. Всё крепче и крепче, с судорожным порывом, сжимая сзади руками Виргинского, он визжал без умолку и без перерыва, выпучив на всех глаза и чрезвычайно раскрыв свой рот, а ногами мелко топотал по земле, точно выбивая по ней барабанную дробь. Виргинский до того испугался, что сам закричал, как безумный, и в каком-то остервенении, до того злобном, что от Виргинского и предположить нельзя было, начал дергаться из рук Лямшина, царапая и колотя его сколько мог достать сзади руками. Эркель помог ему наконец отдернуть Лямшина. Но когда Виргинский отскочил в испуге шагов на десять в сторону, то Лямшин вдруг, увидев Петра Степановича, завопил опять и бросился уже к нему. Запнувшись о труп, он упал через труп на Петра Степановича и уже так крепко обхватил его в своих объятиях, прижимаясь к его груди своею головой, что ни Петр Степанович, ни Толкаченко, ни Липутин в первое мгновение почти ничего не могли сделать. Петр Степанович кричал, ругался, бил его по голове кулаками; наконец, кое-как вырвавшись, выхватил револьвер и наставил его прямо в раскрытый рот всё еще вопившего Лямшина, которого уже крепко схватили за руки Толкаченко, Эркель и Липутин; но Лямшин продолжал визжать, несмотря и на револьвер. Наконец Эркель, скомкав кое-как свой фуляровый платок, ловко вбил его ему в рот, и крик таким образом прекратился. Толкаченко между тем связал ему руки оставшимся концом веревки.","He, perhaps, would have added something else to his so late exclamation, but Lyamshin did not let him finish: all of a sudden, with all his strength, he grabbed him and squeezed him from behind and squealed with some incredible screech. There are strong moments of fright, for example, when a person suddenly screams not in his own voice, but in some kind that could not be expected in him before, and this is sometimes even very scary. Lyamshin shouted not in a human, but in some animal voice. Stronger and stronger, with a convulsive impulse, squeezing Virginsky from behind with his hands, he squealed incessantly and without interruption, his eyes bulging at everyone and his mouth extremely open, and with his feet he stamped lightly on the ground, as if beating out a drum roll on it. Virginsky was so frightened that he himself screamed like a madman, and in a kind of frenzy, so vicious that it was impossible to assume from Virginsky, he began to twitch from Lyamshin's hands, scratching and pounding him as much as he could get from behind with his hands. Erkel finally helped him pull Lyamshin away. But when Virginsky jumped back ten paces in fright, Lyamshin suddenly, seeing Pyotr Stepanovich, yelled again and rushed towards him. Stumbling over the corpse, he fell over the corpse onto Pyotr Stepanovich and already embraced him so tightly in his arms, pressing his head against his chest, that neither Pyotr Stepanovich, nor Tolkachenko, nor Liputin could do almost anything at first. Pyotr Stepanovich shouted, cursed, beat him on the head with his fists; finally, somehow escaping, he grabbed a revolver and pointed it straight into the open mouth of the still screaming Lyamshin, who was already tightly grabbed by the hands of Tolkachenko, Erkel and Liputin; but Lyamshin continued to squeal, in spite of the revolver. Finally, Erkel, having somehow crumpled his foulard handkerchief, deftly drove it into his mouth, and the cry thus ceased. Tolkachenko, meanwhile, tied his hands with the remaining end of the rope.","He perhaps would have added something more to his very belated outcry, but Lyamshin didn’t let him finish: suddenly he wrapped his arms around him with all his might and squeezed him from behind and began to shriek in an inhuman way. There are powerful moments of fear, for instance, when a person suddenly begins to scream in an unnatural voice, one that you could never before have imagined to be his, and that’s sometimes even a very terrifying thing. Lyamshin began to scream in a voice that wasn’t human, but animal-like. Squeezing Virginsky with his hands tighter and tighter from behind, convulsively, he kept shrieking incessantly and without pause, his eyes goggling at everyone and his mouth wide open, his feet pounding on the ground as if they were beating a drum. Virginsky was so frightened that he himself began screaming like a madman, and in a kind of frenzy so vicious that Virginsky was the last person you’d expect it of, he began to wrench free of Lyamshin’s arms, scratching and pounding him as much as he could with his hands behind his back. Finally, Erkel helped him pull Lyamshin away. But when the terrified Virginsky leaped some ten steps to the side, then Lyamshin, on seeing Pyotr Stepanovich, suddenly began howling again and went straight for him. Tripping over the corpse, he fell across it on to Pyotr Stepanovich and gripped him so tightly in his arms, with his head pressed against his chest, that neither Pyotr Stepanovich nor Tolkachenko nor Liputin was able to do anything at first. Pyotr Stepanovich was shouting, cursing, beating him on the head with his fists; finally, somehow pulling loose, he seized the revolver and pointed it straight into the wide-open mouth of Lyamshin, who was still howling, and whose arms by now were being tightly held by Tolkachenko, Erkel and Liputin; but Lyamshin went on shrieking, even despite the revolver. Finally, Erkel, somehow wadding his foulard into a ball, deftly shoved it into his mouth, and so the shouting stopped. Meanwhile, Tolkachenko tied his hands with the remaining piece of rope.","He might have added something more to his so belated exclamation, but Lyamshin did not let him finish: suddenly, and with all his might, he clasped him and squeezed him from behind and let out some sort of incredible shriek.

Squeezing Virginsky from behind harder and harder with his arms, in a convulsive fit, he went on shrieking without stop or pause, his eyes goggling at them all, and his mouth opened exceedingly wide, while his feet rapidly stamped the ground as if beating out a drum roll on it. Virginsky got so scared that he cried out like a madman himself and tried to tear free of Lyamshin's grip in some sort of frenzy, so viciously that one even could not have expected it of Virginsky, scratching and punching him as well he was able to reach behind him with his arms. Erkel finally helped him to tear Lyamshin off. But when, in fear, Virginsky sprang about ten steps away, Lyamshin, seeing Pyotr Stepanovich, suddenly screamed again and rushed at him.

"Собравшиеся на этот раз к Виргинскому гости (почти все мужчины) имели какой-то случайный и экстренный вид. Не было ни закуски, ни карт. Посреди большой гостиной комнаты, оклеенной отменно старыми голубыми обоями, сдвинуты были два стола и покрыты большою скатертью, не совсем, впрочем, чистою, а на них кипели два самовара. Огромный поднос с двадцатью пятью стаканами и корзина с обыкновенным французским белым хлебом, изрезанным на множество ломтей, вроде как в благородных мужских и женских пансионах для воспитанников, занимали конец стола. Чай разливала тридцатилетняя дева, сестра хозяйки, безбровая и белобрысая, существо молчаливое и ядовитое, но разделявшее новые взгляды, и которой ужасно боялся сам Виргинский в домашнем быту. Всех дам в комнате было три: сама хозяйка, безбровая ее сестрица и родная сестра Виргинского, девица Виргинская, как раз только что прикатившая из Петербурга. Арина Прохоровна, видная дама лет двадцати семи, собою недурная, несколько растрепанная, в шерстяном непраздничном платье зеленоватого оттенка, сидела, обводя смелыми очами гостей и как бы спеша проговорить своим взглядом: «Видите, как я совсем ничего не боюсь». Прибывшая девица Виргинская, тоже недурная собой, студентка и нигилистка, сытенькая и плотненькая, как шарик, с очень красными щеками и низенького роста, поместилась подле Арины Прохоровны, еще почти в дорожном своем костюме, с каким-то свертком бумаг в руке, и разглядывала гостей нетерпеливыми прыгающими глазами. Сам Виргинский в этот вечер был несколько нездоров, однако же вышел посидеть в креслах за чайным столом. Все гости тоже сидели, и в этом чинном размещении на стульях вокруг стола предчувствовалось заседание. Видимо, все чего-то ждали, а в ожидании вели хотя и громкие, но как бы посторонние речи. Когда появились Ставрогин и Верховенский, всё вдруг затихло.","The guests who had gathered this time at Virginsky's (almost all men) had a kind of casual and extraordinary air. There were no snacks, no cards. In the middle of a large living room, pasted over with remarkably old blue wallpaper, two tables were moved and covered with a large tablecloth, not quite clean, however, and two samovars were boiling on them. A huge tray with twenty-five glasses and a basket of ordinary French white bread, cut into many slices, like in noble men's and women's boarding schools for pupils, occupied the end of the table. The tea was poured by a thirty-year-old maiden, the sister of the hostess, eyebrowless and blond, a silent and poisonous creature, but sharing new views, and whom Virginsky himself was terribly afraid of at home. There were three ladies in the room: the hostess herself, her eyebrowless sister, and Virginsky's own sister, the maiden Virginskaya, who had just arrived from Petersburg. Arina Prokhorovna, a prominent lady of about twenty-seven, not bad-looking, somewhat disheveled, in a non-holiday woolen dress of a greenish tint, sat, looking around her guests with bold eyes and, as if hastily, saying with her eyes: “You see how I am not at all afraid of anything.” The maiden Virginskaya, also not bad-looking, a student and a nihilist, well-fed and plump, like a balloon, with very red cheeks and short in stature, placed herself beside Arina Prokhorovna, still almost in her traveling suit, with some kind of roll of papers in her hand, and looked at guests with impatient jumping eyes. Virginsky himself was somewhat unwell that evening, but he went out to sit in armchairs at the tea table. All the guests were also seated, and in this decorous arrangement on chairs around the table, a meeting was foreshadowed. Apparently, everyone was waiting for something, and in anticipation they were talking, although loud, but, as it were, extraneous speeches. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky appeared, everything suddenly calmed down.","The guests who had gathered at Virginsky’s on this occasion (almost all men) had a kind of casual and urgent look about them.

Arina Prokhorovna, a striking lady of about twenty-seven, not at all bad-looking, though somewhat dishevelled, wearing an everyday greenish woollen dress, was sitting and taking in the guests with bold eyes, as though in a hurry to say: ‘You see, I’m not a fraid of anything.’ The newly arrived Virginskaya, who was not bad-looking either, a student and a nihilist, rather plump and as round and compact as a little ball, rather short and with very red cheeks, had stationed herself next to Arina Prokhorovna, still almost in her travelling clothes, and was holding a sheaf of papers1 in her hand and surveying the guests with impatient dancing eyes. Virginsky himself was rather unwell this evening, but he did come out to sit for a while in an armchair at the tea-table. All the guests were also sitting, and this orderly distribution of people in chairs around the table created the impression that a meeting was about to take place. Evidently all were waiting for something, and in anticipation were carrying on loud but seemingly irrelevant conversations. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky appeared, everyone suddenly fell quiet.","The guests who gathered at Virginsky's this time (almost all men) had some sort of accidental and urgent look.1 There were no refreshments or cards. In the middle of the big drawing room, papered with supremely old blue wallpaper, two tables had been moved together and covered with a big tablecloth, not quite clean, incidentally, and on them two samovars were boiling. A huge tray with twenty-five glasses and a basket of ordinary French bread cut up into many slices, somewhat as in upper-class male and female children's boarding schools, occupied the end of the table. Tea was poured by a thirty-year-old maiden lady, the hostess's sister, browless and pale-haired, a silent and venomous being, but who shared in the new views, and of whom Virginsky, in his domestic existence, was terribly afraid. All together there were three ladies in the room: the hostess herself, her browless sister, and Virginsky's sister, the young Miss Virginsky, who had just got in from Petersburg. Arina Prokhorovna, an imposing lady of about twenty-seven, not bad-looking, somewhat unkempt, in a non-festive woolen dress of a greenish shade, was sitting and looking over her guests with a dauntless gaze, as if hastening to say with her eyes: "" See how I'm not afraid of anything at all."" The visiting Miss Virginsky, also not bad-looking, a student and a nihilist, well fed and well packed, like a little ball, with very red cheeks, and of short stature, had placed herself next to Arina Prokhorovna, still almost in her traveling clothes, with some bundle of papers in her hand, and was studying the guests with impatient, leaping eyes. Virginsky himself was somewhat unwell that evening, but he nevertheless came out and sat in an armchair at the tea table. The guests were all sitting down as well, and this decorous disposition on chairs around a table gave the suggestion of a meeting. Obviously they were all waiting for something, and, while waiting, engaged each other in loud but as if irrelevant conversation. When Stavrogin and Verkhovensky appeared, everything suddenly became hushed."

"– Да всё это такие пустяки-с… то есть этот капитан, по всем видимостям, уезжал от нас тогда не для фальшивых бумажек, а единственно затем только, чтоб эту сестрицу свою разыскать, а та будто бы от него пряталась в неизвестном месте; ну а теперь привез, вот и вся история. Чего вы точно испугались, Степан Трофимович? Впрочем, я всё с его же пьяной болтовни говорю, а трезвый он и сам об этом прималчивает. Человек раздражительный и, как бы так сказать, военно-эстетический, но дурного только вкуса. А сестрица эта не только сумасшедшая, но даже хромоногая. Была будто бы кем-то обольщена в своей чести, и за это вот господин Лебядкин, уже многие годы, будто бы с обольстителя ежегодную дань берет, в вознаграждение благородной обиды, так по крайней мере из его болтовни выходит – а по-моему, пьяные только слова-с. Просто хвастается. Да и делается это гораздо дешевле. А что суммы у него есть, так это совершенно уж верно; полторы недели назад на босу ногу ходил, а теперь, сам видел, сотни в руках. У сестрицы припадки какие-то ежедневные, визжит она, а он-то ее «в порядок приводит» нагайкой. В женщину, говорит, надо вселять уважение. Вот не пойму, как еще Шатов над ними уживается. Алексей Нилыч только три денька и простояли с ними, еще с Петербурга были знакомы, а теперь флигелек от беспокойства занимают.","- Yes, all this is such trifles, sir ... that is, this captain, by all appearances, did not leave us then for false papers, but only then only to find this sister of hers, and she seemed to be hiding from him in an unknown place; Well, now he brought it, that's the whole story. What exactly are you afraid of, Stepan Trofimovich? However, I still speak from his drunken chatter, and when sober, he himself keeps silent about it. The person is irritable and, as it were, military-aesthetic, but only in bad taste. And this sister is not only crazy, but even lame. It was as if she had been seduced by someone in her honor, and for this, Mr. Lebyadkin, for many years now, as if he takes an annual tribute from the seducer, as a reward for a noble offense, so at least it comes out of his chatter - but in my opinion, drunk only words-s. Just showing off. Yes, and it's much cheaper. And that he has sums, that is absolutely true; a week and a half ago I walked barefoot, and now, I saw for myself, hundreds in my hands. My sister has some kind of daily seizures, she squeals, and he “puts her in order” with a whip. In a woman, he says, it is necessary to inspire respect. I don’t understand how else Shatov gets along with them. Aleksei Nilych only stayed with them for three days, they had known each other since St. Petersburg, but now they are occupying the wing out of anxiety.","‘Oh well, it’s all just such trivial stuff, you know… That is to say, the captain, to all appearances, left here at that time not because of the counterfeit notes, but for the sole purpose of finding this younger sister of his, and she had supposedly hidden from him in some unknown place. Well, now he’s brought her back, and that’s the whole story. Why do you seem so frightened, Stepan Trofimovich? Besides, I’m only telling you what I gather from his own drunken babbling; but when he’s sober he himself keeps his mouth shut about it. He’s an irritable man, and, how should I put it, a military aesthete, only with very bad taste. And this sister of his is not only insane, but crippled as well. She was supposedly seduced by someone, lost her virtue, and for that our Mr Lebyadkin has supposedly been receiving compensation from the seducer every year for many years now, in recompense for the insult to his honour, or so at least his babbling would have us believe. But in my opinion, it’s nothing but a lot of drunken talk. He’s just boasting. And that sort of thing costs a good deal less. But as for his having large sums of money, that’s absolutely true; a week and a half ago he was walking around barefoot, and now, I’ve seen it for myself, he’s got hundreds. His sister has some kind of seizures every day; she screams, and he “puts her back in working order” with his whip. You have to instil respect in a woman, he says. What I can’t understand is how Shatov gets on with them, living as he does right above. Aleksey Nilych stayed with them just three days; they already knew each other from Petersburg, and now he’s rented the small house in the yard to get away from all the turmoil.’","""It's all really such trifles, sir ... that is, this captain, in all likelihood, left us then not from the bogus banknotes, but just so as to find this sister of his, and she was allegedly hiding in some unknown place; well, and now he's brought her, that's the whole story. Why is it you seem so frightened, Stepan Trofimovich? I'm only repeating his drunken babble, anyway; when he's sober he keeps mum about it.

She supposedly had her honor seduced by somebody, and for that Mr. Lebyadkin has supposedly been taking an annual tribute from the seducer for many years, in reward for a noble offense, so at least it comes out from his babble- but I think it's just drunken talk, sir. He's simply boasting. Such things are handled more cheaply. But that he has money- that is completely correct: a week and a half ago he was walking around without socks, and now I've seen for myself he has hundreds in his hands. His sister has some kind of fits every day, she shrieks, and he 'puts her in order' with a quirt. One has to instill respect into a woman, he says. Only I don't understand how Shatov can go on living near them. Alexei Nilych stayed just three days, he's known them since Petersburg, and now he's living in the wing on account of the disturbance."""

"В тот же день, разумеется, арестовали и Виргинского, а сгоряча и весь дом. (Арина Прохоровна, ее сестра, тетка и даже студентка теперь давно уже на воле; говорят даже, что и Шигалев будто бы непременно будет выпущен в самом скором времени, так как ни под одну категорию обвиняемых не подходит; впрочем, это всё еще только разговор). Виргинский сразу и во всем повинился: он лежал больной и был в жару, когда его арестовали. Говорят, он почти обрадовался: «С сердца свалилось», – проговорил он будто бы. Слышно про него, что он дает теперь показания откровенно, но с некоторым даже достоинством и не отступает ни от одной из «светлых надежд» своих, проклиная в то же время политический путь (в противоположность социальному), на который был увлечен так нечаянно и легкомысленно «вихрем сошедшихся обстоятельств». Поведение его при совершении убийства разъясняется в смягчающем для него смысле, кажется и он тоже может рассчитывать на некоторое смягчение своей участи. Так по крайней мере у нас утверждают.","On the same day, of course, Virginsky was arrested, and in the heat of the moment the whole house. (Arina Prokhorovna, her sister, aunt, and even a student, have now been free for a long time; they even say that Shigalev will certainly be released in the very near future, since he does not fit into any category of accused; however, this is still just a conversation ). Virginsky immediately and in everything confessed: he was ill and in a fever when he was arrested. They say that he was almost delighted: “It fell off my heart,” he seemed to say. It is heard about him that he now testifies frankly, but with some even dignity, and does not deviate from any of his “bright hopes”, while at the same time cursing the political path (as opposed to the social one), on which he was so inadvertently and frivolously carried away. ""a whirlwind of converging circumstances."" His behavior during the commission of the murder is explained in a mitigating sense for him, it seems that he, too, can count on some mitigation of his fate.

Virginsky immediately confessed to everything; he was sick in bed and feverish when he was arrested. They say that he was almost glad: ‘A weight dropped from my heart’, was how he supposedly put it. One hears that he’s now giving evidence without constraint, albeit with a certain dignity, and isn’t retreating from a single one of his ‘bright hopes’, while at the same time cursing the political direction (in contrast to the social) into which he was so unexpectedly and naively enticed ‘by the whirlwind of concurrent circumstances’. His behaviour at the time of the murder has been seen in a mitigating light, and apparently he, too, can count on a certain mitigation of his sentence.

"Mademoiselle Лебядкина, которую я так желал видеть, смирно и неслышно сидела во второй комнате в углу, за тесовым кухонным столом, на лавке. Она нас не окликнула, когда мы отворяли дверь, не двинулась даже с места. Шатов говорил, что у них и дверь не запирается, а однажды так настежь в сени всю ночь и простояла. При свете тусклой тоненькой свечки в железном подсвечнике я разглядел женщину лет, может быть, тридцати, болезненно-худощавую, одетую в темное старенькое ситцевое платье, с ничем не прикрытою длинною шеей и с жиденькими темными волосами, свернутыми на затылке в узелок, толщиной в кулачок двухлетнего ребенка. Она посмотрела на нас довольно весело; кроме подсвечника, пред нею на столе находилось маленькое деревенское зеркальце, старая колода карт, истрепанная книжка какого-то песенника и немецкая белая булочка, от которой было уже раз или два откушено. Заметно было, что mademoiselle Лебядкина белится и румянится и губы чем-то мажет. Сурмит тоже брови, и без того длинные, тонкие и темные. На узком и высоком лбу ее, несмотря на белила, довольно резко обозначались три длинные морщинки. Я уже знал, что она хромая, но в этот раз при нас она не вставала и не ходила. Когда-нибудь, в первой молодости, это исхудавшее лицо могло быть и недурным; но тихие, ласковые, серые глаза ее были и теперь еще замечательны; что-то мечтательное и искреннее светилось в ее тихом, почти радостном взгляде. Эта тихая, спокойная радость, выражавшаяся и в улыбке ее, удивила меня после всего, что я слышал о казацкой нагайке и о всех бесчинствах братца. Странно, что вместо тяжелого и даже боязливого отвращения, ощущаемого обыкновенно в присутствии всех подобных, наказанных богом существ, мне стало почти приятно смотреть на нее с первой же минуты, и только разве жалость, но отнюдь не отвращение, овладела мною потом.","Mademoiselle Lebyadkina, whom I so longed to see, sat quietly and inaudibly in the corner of the second room, at the kitchen table, on a bench. She did not call us when we opened the door, she did not even move from her place. Shatov said that even the door was not locked with them, and once she stood wide open in the passage all night. By the light of a dim, thin candle in an iron candlestick, I made out a woman of about thirty years old, painfully thin, dressed in a dark old calico dress, with a long neck that was not covered in any way and with thin dark hair curled at the back of her head into a knot, as thick as a fist. two year old child. She looked at us rather cheerfully; besides the candlestick, on the table in front of her was a small rustic mirror, an old pack of cards, a tattered book from some songbook, and a German white bun that had already been bitten off once or twice. It was noticeable that Mademoiselle Lebyadkina was turning white and blushing and smearing her lips with something. Surmit also has eyebrows, already long, thin and dark. On her narrow and high forehead, in spite of the whiteness, three long wrinkles were rather sharply marked. I already knew that she was lame, but this time in our presence she did not get up and did not walk. Someday, in early youth, this emaciated face might not have been bad; but her quiet, affectionate, gray eyes were and are still remarkable; something dreamy and sincere shone in her quiet, almost joyful look. This quiet, calm joy, expressed in her smile, surprised me after everything I had heard about the Cossack whip and all the atrocities of my brother. It is strange that instead of the heavy and even timid repulsion usually felt in the presence of all such beings punished by God, it became almost pleasant for me to look at her from the very first minute, and only pity, but by no means revulsion, took possession of me afterwards.","Mademoiselle Lebyadkina, whom I had so been wanting to see, was sitting meekly and silently in a corner of the second room on a bench, at the deal kitchen table.

Shatov had said that their door didn’t lock, and that on one occasion it had stood wide open to the entryway all night long. By the dim light of a spindly candle in an iron candlestick, I could make out a woman of perhaps thirty, sickly and gaunt, wearing an old, dark cotton dress, her long neck uncovered and her scanty dark hair twisted at the nape of her neck into a knot as thick as the fist of a two-year-old child. She glanced at us rather happily. There on the table before her, besides the candlestick, were a small peasant-style looking glass, an old pack of cards, a tattered songbook of some kind and a white German roll, out of which one or two bites had already been taken. It was noticeable that Mademoiselle Lebyadkina used powder and rouge, and smeared something on her lips. She also darkened her eyebrows, which were long, thin and black anyway. On her narrow, high forehead, despite the powder, three long wrinkles were rather sharply etched. I already knew that she was a cripple, but on this occasion she didn’t get up or walk while we were present. At some time in her early youth this emaciated face might even have been attractive; but her soft, gentle grey eyes were still remarkable even now; something dreamy and sincere shone in her gentle, almost joyful gaze. This gentle, calm joyfulness, which found expression in her smile as well, surprised me after everything I had heard about the Cossack whip and all the other enormities of her brother. It was strange that instead of the oppressive and even apprehensive revulsion that is usually felt in the presence of all such beings who have been punished by God, I almost took pleasure in looking at her from the very first moment, and only pity, certainly not revulsion, overcame me later on.","Mlle.

"Не любила она и Шатова, всего только в последний год ставшего членом кружка. Шатов был прежде студентом и был исключен после одной студентской истории из университета; в детстве же был учеником Степана Трофимовича, а родился крепостным Варвары Петровны, от покойного камердинера ее Павла Федорова, и был ею облагодетельствован. Не любила она его за гордость и неблагодарность и никак не могла простить ему, что он по изгнании из университета не приехал к ней тотчас же; напротив, даже на тогдашнее нарочное письмо ее к нему ничего не ответил и предпочел закабалиться к какому-то цивилизованному купцу учить детей. Вместе с семьей этого купца он выехал за границу, скорее в качестве дядьки, чем гувернера; но уж очень хотелось ему тогда за границу. При детях находилась еще и гувернантка, бойкая русская барышня, поступившая в дом тоже пред самым выездом и принятая более за дешевизну. Месяца через два купец ее выгнал «за вольные мысли». Поплелся за нею и Шатов и вскорости обвенчался с нею в Женеве. Прожили они вдвоем недели с три, а потом расстались, как вольные и ничем не связанные люди; конечно, тоже и по бедности. Долго потом скитался он один по Европе, жил бог знает чем; говорят, чистил на улицах сапоги и в каком-то порте был носильщиком. Наконец, с год тому назад вернулся к нам в родное гнездо и поселился со старухой теткой, которую и схоронил через месяц. С сестрой своею Дашей, тоже воспитанницей Варвары Петровны, жившею у ней фавориткой на самой благородной ноге, он имел самые редкие и отдаленные сношения. Между нами был постоянно угрюм и неразговорчив; но изредка, когда затрогивали его убеждения, раздражался болезненно и был очень невоздержан на язык. «Шатова надо сначала связать, а потом уж с ним рассуждать», – шутил иногда Степан Трофимович; но он любил его. За границей Шатов радикально изменил некоторые из прежних социалистических своих убеждений и перескочил в противоположную крайность. Это было одно из тех идеальных русских существ, которых вдруг поразит какая-нибудь сильная идея и тут же разом точно придавит их собою, иногда даже навеки. Справиться с нею они никогда не в силах, а уверуют страстно, и вот вся жизнь их проходит потом как бы в последних корчах под свалившимся на них и наполовину совсем уже раздавившим их камнем. Наружностью Шатов вполне соответствовал своим убеждениям: он был неуклюж, белокур, космат, низкого роста, с широкими плечами, толстыми губами, с очень густыми, нависшими белобрысыми бровями, с нахмуренным лбом, с неприветливым, упорно потупленным и как бы чего-то стыдящимся взглядом. На волосах его вечно оставался один такой вихор, который ни за что не хотел пригладиться и стоял торчком. Лет ему было двадцать семь или двадцать восемь. «Я не удивляюсь более, что жена от него сбежала», – отнеслась Варвара Петровна однажды, пристально к нему приглядевшись. Старался он одеваться чистенько, несмотря на чрезвычайную свою бедность. К Варваре Петровне опять не обратился за помощию, а пробивался чем бог пошлет; занимался и у купцов. Раз сидел в лавке, потом совсем было уехал на пароходе с товаром, приказчичьим помощником, но заболел пред самою отправкой. Трудно представить себе, какую нищету способен он был переносить, даже и не думая о ней вовсе. Варвара Петровна после его болезни переслала ему секретно и анонимно сто рублей. Он разузнал, однако же, секрет, подумал, деньги принял и пришел к Варваре Петровне поблагодарить. Та с жаром приняла его, но он и тут постыдно обманул ее ожидания: просидел всего пять минут, молча, тупо уставившись в землю и глупо улыбаясь, и вдруг, не дослушав ее и на самом интересном месте разговора, встал, поклонился как-то боком, косолапо, застыдился в прах, кстати уж задел и грохнул об пол ее дорогой наборный рабочий столик, разбил его и вышел, едва живой от позора. Липутин очень укорял его потом за то, что он не отвергнул тогда с презрением эти сто рублей, как от бывшей его деспотки помещицы, и не только принял, а еще благодарить потащился. Жил он уединенно, на краю города, и не любил, если кто-нибудь даже из нас заходил к нему. На вечера к Степану Трофимовичу являлся постоянно и брал у него читать газеты и книги.","She also did not like Shatov, who only in the last year became a member of the circle. Shatov was formerly a student and was expelled after one student story from the university; in childhood, he was a student of Stepan Trofimovich, and was born a serf of Varvara Petrovna, from her late valet Pavel Fedorov, and was blessed by her. She did not love him for his pride and ingratitude, and she could not forgive him in any way for not coming to her immediately after being expelled from the university; on the contrary, he did not even reply to her express letter to him at that time and preferred to be enslaved to some civilized merchant to teach children. Together with the family of this merchant, he went abroad, rather as an uncle than a tutor; but he really wanted to go abroad then. The children also had a governess, a brisk Russian young lady, who also entered the house just before leaving and was taken more for cheapness. Two months later, the merchant kicked her out ""for free thoughts."" Shatov followed her and soon married her in Geneva. They lived together for about three weeks, and then parted as free and unconnected people; of course, also for poverty. For a long time afterwards he wandered alone through Europe, living God knows what; they say he cleaned boots on the streets and was a porter in some port. Finally, about a year ago, he returned to our native nest and settled with an old aunt, whom he buried a month later. With his sister Dasha, also a pupil of Varvara Petrovna, who lived with her as a favorite on the noblest foot, he had the rarest and most distant intercourse. Between us he was constantly sullen and taciturn; but occasionally, when his convictions were touched upon, he became painfully irritated and was very intemperate in his language. “Shatov must first be tied up, and then you can reason with him,” Stepan Trofimovich sometimes joked; but he loved him. Abroad, Shatov radically changed some of his former socialist convictions and jumped to the opposite extreme. It was one of those ideal Russian creatures who are suddenly struck by some strong idea and immediately crushed by itself, sometimes even forever. They will never be able to cope with it, but they will passionately believe, and then their whole life then passes, as it were, in the last writhings under the stone that has fallen on them and has already completely crushed them. In appearance, Shatov fully corresponded to his convictions: he was clumsy, blond, shaggy, short in stature, with broad shoulders, thick lips, very thick, hanging blond eyebrows, with a frown on his forehead, with an unfriendly, stubbornly downcast and, as it were, ashamed look. . On his hair there always remained one such tuft, which for no reason wanted to be smoothed and stood erect. He was twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. “I am no longer surprised that his wife ran away from him,” Varvara Petrovna once reacted, looking at him intently. He tried to dress cleanly, despite his extreme poverty. Again he did not turn to Varvara Petrovna for help, but fought his way with whatever God would send; worked with merchants. Once he was sitting in a shop, then he was about to leave on a steamer with goods, as a clerk's assistant, but he fell ill just before departure. It is difficult to imagine what poverty he was able to endure without even thinking about it at all. Varvara Petrovna, after his illness, sent him secretly and anonymously one hundred rubles. However, he found out the secret, thought about it, accepted the money and came to Varvara Petrovna to thank her. She received him warmly, but even then he shamefully deceived her expectations: he sat for only five minutes, silently, staring stupidly at the ground and smiling stupidly, and suddenly, without listening to her and at the most interesting point of the conversation, he got up, bowed somehow sideways , clubfoot, ashamed to dust, by the way, he already touched and slammed her expensive typesetting work table on the floor, smashed it and left, barely alive from shame. Liputin reproached him greatly later for not rejecting those hundred rubles with contempt, as from his former despot landowner, and not only accepted, but also dragged himself to thank him. He lived alone, on the edge of the city, and did not like it if even one of us came to him. At evenings he was constantly at Stepan Trofimovich's and borrowed newspapers and books from him to read.","She didn’t like Shatov either, who had become a member of the circle only in the past year. Shatov had formerly been a student, and had been expelled from the university after an incident involving some students. But as a child he had been a pupil of Stepan Trofimovich, though he had been born a serf, the son of Varvara Petrovna’s deceased valet, Pavel Fyodorovich, and she had taken him under her wing. She didn’t like him because of his pride and ingratitude, and simply couldn’t forgive him for having failed to come to her immediately after being expelled from the university. Quite the contrary: he didn’t even reply to the letter she had expressly sent him on that occasion, preferring instead to enslave himself to some cultivated merchant as a teacher of his children. He accompanied this merchant’s family abroad, more in the capacity of a babysitter than a tutor; but he very much wanted to go abroad just then. The children also had a governess, a lively young Russian lady, who had also come into the household just before they departed, and had been hired mainly because she came cheap. In a couple of months the merchant dismissed her for ‘freethinking’.45 Shatov tagged along behind her, and hastily married her in Geneva. They lived together for about three weeks, and then went their separate ways, being free and not bound by anything — and also, of course, because they had no money. Then he spent a long time wandering through Europe, living God knows how; people said that he cleaned boots on the streets and was a stevedore in some port. Finally, about a year ago, he returned to us, to his native nest, and settled down with an old aunt, whom he proceeded to bury within a month. He had a sister, Dasha, who had also been brought up by Varvara Petrovna and lived in her house as her favourite and as an equal in all respects; but he maintained an extremely infrequent and distant relationship with her. In our circle he was unfailingly gloomy and untalkative; but occasionally, when the conversation touched on his convictions, he would become morbidly irritated and completely lose control of his tongue. ‘Shatov has first to be tied up, and only then can you discuss anything with him,’ Stepan Trofimovich sometimes said jokingly; but he liked him. While abroad Shatov radically revised certain of his former socialist convictions and jumped to the opposite extreme. He was one of those idealistic Russian beings who are suddenly struck by some powerful idea and immediately, then and there, seem to be crushed by it, even sometimes permanently. They are never equipped to deal with it, and instead come to believe in it passionately, and so their entire life from then on passes in its final throes, as it were, under the stone that has fallen upon them and already crushed them half to death. In appearance, Shatov was all of a piece with his convictions. He was clumsy, fair-haired, dishevelled, short in stature, with broad shoulders, thick lips, very bushy beetling whitish eyebrows, a brow knitted into a frown and hostile eyes stubbornly fixed on the ground and seemingly ashamed of something. One tuft of hair simply resisted smoothing down, and was always sticking up. He was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. ‘I’m no longer surprised that his wife ran away from him,’ opined Varvara Petrovna on one occasion, after scrutinizing him carefully. He made an effort to dress neatly, despite his extreme poverty. Once again he didn’t turn to Varvara Petrovna for help, but struggled along with whatever God sent; he also did some odd jobs for the local merchants. Once he worked in a shop, and later he was just on the point of going off on a freighter as a clerk’s assistant, but fell ill just before he was to set sail. It’s difficult to imagine the poverty that he was capable of enduring, without even giving it the slightest thought. After his illness Varvara Petrovna sent him a hundred roubles secretly and anonymously. However, he found out the secret, and after giving it some thought he accepted the money and went to thank Varvara Petrovna. She received him warmly, but on this occasion, too, he shamefully disappointed her expectations: he remained sitting for only five minutes, saying nothing, staring vacantly at the floor with a stupid smile, and then suddenly, without waiting for her to finish the most interesting part of the conversation, stood up, made a clumsy kind of sideways bow, felt crushed with shame, and in the process brushed against her expensive and fancy little work-table,46 sent it crashing to the floor, smashed to pieces, and walked out, nearly dead from humiliation. Liputin later took him to task severely for not refusing (and with contempt) those hundred roubles at the outset, coming from his despotic former patroness, and for not only accepting them, but even crawling to thank her for them. Shatov lived in isolation, on the outskirts of town, and didn’t like anyone to come and visit him, even one of us. He always appeared at Stepan Trofimovich’s soirees and took newspapers and books from him to read.","She also did not like Shatov, who became a member of the circle only in the last year. Shatov had been a student, but was expelled from the university after some student incident; as a child he had been Stepan Trofimovich's pupil, and he had been born Varvara Petrovna's serf, the son of her late valet Pavel Fyodorov, and had been the object of her benefactions. She disliked him for his pride and ingratitude, and simply could not forgive him for not coming to her at once after he was expelled from the university; on the contrary, he did not even reply to the letter she specially sent him then, and preferred putting himself in bondage to some civilized merchant as teacher of his children. He went abroad with this merchant's family, more as a baby-sitter than as a tutor; but at the time he wanted very much to go abroad. The children had a governess as well, a pert Russian girl who also joined the household just before their departure and was taken mainly for her cheapness. About two months later the merchant threw her out for ""free thoughts. "" Shatov went trudging after her and soon married her in Geneva. They lived together for about three weeks, and then parted as free people not bound by anything; also, of course, because of poverty. For a long time afterwards he wandered around Europe alone, living God knows how; they say he shined shoes in the streets and worked as a stevedore in some port. Finally, about a year ago, he came back to his own nest here and stayed with an old aunt, whom he buried within a month. His communications with his sister Dasha, who was also Varvara Petrovna's ward and lived with her as her favorite on the most noble footing, were very rare and distant. With us he was perpetually glum and taciturn; but occasionally, when his convictions were touched upon, he became morbidly irritated and quite unrestrained in his language. "" Shatov should be tied up before you try reasoning with him,"" Stepan Trofimovich sometimes joked; yet he loved him. Abroad, Shatov had radically changed some of his former socialist convictions and leaped to the opposite extreme. He was one of those ideal Russian beings who can suddenly be so struck by some strong idea that it seems to crush them then and there, sometimes even forever. They are never strong enough to master it, but they are passionate believers, and so their whole life afterwards is spent in some last writhings, as it were, under the stone that has fallen on them and already half crushed them. In appearance Shatov corresponded completely to his convictions: he was clumsy, blond, shaggy, short, with broad shoulders, thick lips, bushy, beetling white eyebrows, a scowling forehead, and unfriendly eyes stubbornly downcast and as if ashamed of something. There was this one lock of his hair that simply refused to lie flat and was eternally sticking up. He was twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. "" It no longer surprises me that his wife ran away from him,"" Varvara Petrovna once allowed, after studying him intently. He tried to dress neatly, despite his extreme poverty. He again refused to turn to Varvara Petrovna for help, but got by on whatever God sent him; he also had some doings with shopkeepers. One time he sat in a shop; then he almost left altogether on a trading ship as a salesman's assistant, but fell ill just before the departure. It is hard to imagine what poverty he was able to endure without even giving it a thought. After his illness, Varvara Petrovna secretly and anonymously sent him a hundred roubles. He found out the secret, however, pondered, accepted the money, and went to Varvara Petrovna to thank her. She received him warmly, but here, too, he shamefully deceived her expectations: he sat for only five minutes, silent, staring dully at the floor and smiling stupidly, and suddenly, without letting her finish speaking and at the most interesting point of the conversation, got up, bowed somehow sideways, hulkily, dissolved in shame, incidentally brushed against her expensive inlaid worktable, which went crashing to the floor and broke, and walked out nearly dead from disgrace. Liputin later upbraided him strongly, not only for accepting the hundred roubles instead of rejecting them with contempt as coming from his former despot-landowner, but for dragging himself there to thank her on top of it. He lived solitarily on the outskirts of town, and did not like it when anyone, even one of us, stopped to see him. He regularly came to Stepan Trofimovich's evenings, and borrowed newspapers and books to read from him."
"Так просидели мы еще несколько минут в совершенном молчании. Степан Трофимович начал было вдруг мне что-то очень скоро шептать, но я не расслушал; да и сам он от волнения не докончил и бросил. Вошел еще раз камердинер поправить что-то на столе; а вернее – поглядеть на нас. Шатов вдруг обратился к нему с громким вопросом:","We sat like that for a few more minutes in perfect silence. Stepan Trofimovich suddenly began to whisper something to me very quickly, but I didn't hear it; Yes, and he himself did not finish it from excitement and quit. The valet came in again to straighten something on the table; Or rather, look at us. Shatov suddenly turned to him with a loud question:","And so we sat for several minutes more in complete silence. Stepan Trofimovich suddenly tried to whisper something to me very rapidly, but I couldn’t hear it; and then he himself was too agitated to finish it and let it go.

"Замечу вскользь, что в эту несчастную неделю я вынес много тоски, оставаясь почти безотлучно подле бедного сосватанного друга моего в качестве ближайшего его конфидента. Тяготил его, главное, стыд, хотя мы в эту неделю никого не видали и всё сидели одни; но он стыдился даже и меня, и до того, что чем более сам открывал мне, тем более и досадовал на меня за это. По мнительности же подозревал, что всё уже всем известно, всему городу, и не только в клубе, но даже в своем кружке боялся показаться. Даже гулять выходил, для необходимого моциону, только в полные сумерки, когда уже совершенно темнело.","Let me remark in passing that in this unfortunate week I endured a lot of anguish, remaining almost incessantly near my poor betrothed friend as his closest confidant. He was weighed down, most importantly, by shame, although we had not seen anyone that week and were all sitting alone; but he was even ashamed of me, and to the point that the more he revealed himself to me, the more he became annoyed with me for it. In his suspiciousness, he suspected that everything was already known to everyone, the whole city, and not only in the club, but even in his own circle, he was afraid to show himself. He even went out for a walk, for the necessary exercise, only at full twilight, when it was already completely dark.","I will note in passing that during this unhappy week I suffered a great deal of anguish, remaining as I did virtually inseparable from my poor engaged friend in my capacity as his closest confidant. What lay heaviest on him was shame, even though we saw no one during that week and remained by ourselves; but he was even ashamed in my presence, and to the point where the more he opened himself up to me, the more irritated he became with me because of it. His anxious nature led him to suspect that everything was already known to everyone, to the entire town, and he was afraid to show himself not only at the club, but even in his own circle. He even went out for a walk, for the obligatory constitutional, only well after dusk, when it had already grown quite dark.","I will observe in passing that I endured much anguish during this unfortunate week, staying almost constantly at the side of my poor matchmade friend in the quality of his closest confidant. It was mainly shame that oppressed him, though during this week we did not see anyone and sat by ourselves all the time; but he was ashamed even before me, and to such an extent that the more he revealed to me, the more vexed he was with me for it. In his insecurity he suspected that everyone already knew everything, all over town, and was afraid to show himself not only at the club but in his own circle as well. Even for a stroll, to get the necessary exercise, he would go out only at full dusk, when it was already quite dark."

Я опять попался. Вы не сказали бы: «вы умны», ну и положим; я всё допускаю. Passons, как говорит папаша, и, в скобках, не сердитесь на мое многословие. Кстати, вот и пример: я всегда говорю много, то есть много слов, и тороплюсь, и у меня всегда не выходит. А почему я говорю много слов и у меня не выходит? Потому что говорить не умею. Те, которые умеют хорошо говорить, те коротко говорят. Вот, стало быть, у меня и бездарность, – не правда ли? Но так как этот дар бездарности у меня уже есть натуральный, так почему мне им не воспользоваться искусственно? Я и пользуюсь.

Don't worry, don't worry, I'm not angry and I didn't define myself in this way at all in order to evoke your reverse praises: “No, they say, you are not mediocre, no, they say, you smart”… Ah, you are smiling again!.. I got caught again. You would not say: ""you are smart"", well, let's put it; I allow everything. Passons, as papa says, and, in parentheses, don't get mad at my verbosity. By the way, here's an example: I always say a lot, that is, a lot of words, and I'm in a hurry, and I always fail. And why do I say a lot of words and I don't get it? Because I can't speak. Those who can speak well, those who speak briefly. So, therefore, I have mediocrity, is not it? But since I already have this gift of mediocrity natural, so why shouldn't I use it artificially? I also use. True, when I was going here, I thought at first to be silent; but silence is a great talent, and, therefore, it is indecent for me, and secondly, it is dangerous to be silent after all; Well, I have finally decided that it is best to speak, but precisely in a mediocre way, that is, a lot, a lot, a lot, to be in a great hurry to prove and in the end always get confused in your own proofs, so that the listener moves away from you endlessly, spreading his arms , but just spitting would be better. It will turn out, firstly, that you assured of your innocence, you were very tired and misunderstood - all three benefits at once! Pardon me, who after this will begin to suspect you of mysterious plans? Yes, each of them will personally be offended by the one who says that I have secret plans. And besides, I sometimes laugh - and that's precious. Yes, they will forgive me everything now for the mere fact that the sage who issued proclamations there turned out to be more stupid than they themselves, isn't it? I can see from your smile that you approve.","‘Ah, you agree, I’m very glad; I knew in advance that you thought the same way… Don’t worry, don’t worry, I’m not angry and I didn’t define myself that way to get you to come up with praise in response. “No,” you’d say, “you’re not without talent, no,” you’d say, “you’re intelligent”… Ah, you’re smiling again! … I’ve been caught again. You wouldn’t have said “you’re intelligent”, let’s suppose so, anyway: I grant everything. Passons, as papa says, and, in parentheses, don’t get angry at my verbosity. By the way, here’s an instance: I always talk a great deal, that is, I use a lot of words, and I talk very fast, and nothing ever comes out of me. And why do I use so many words and nothing ever comes out of me? Because I don’t know how to talk. Those who do know how to talk well, talk briefly. And so that’s a lack of giftedness on my part, isn’t that so? But since this gift of not being gifted is already natural to me, then why shouldn’t I make use of it in an artificial way? And so I’m making use of it. True enough, as I was planning to come here, I thought at first that I would say nothing; but to say nothing, you know, is a great talent, and therefore unsuitable for me, and in the second place, it’s really rather dangerous to keep silent. So then, I finally decided that it was best of all to speak, but just as if I had no gift for it, that is, at length, at great length, at very great length, to be in a great hurry to prove my points, and in the end, by always getting all tangled up in my own attempts to make my points, the listener would walk away from me before I came to the end, throwing up his hands or, even better, dismissing me with contempt. The result would be, in the first place, that you’ve convinced people of your simplemindedness, bored them to death and been incomprehensible — all three advantages simultaneously! I ask you, who’s going to suspect you of harbouring secret designs after that? Why, every one of them will take personal umbrage at anyone who says that I’m harbouring secret designs. And in addition, I’ll make them laugh sometimes — and that’s really valuable. Why, then they’ll all forgive me now just for the fact that the clever fellow who’s been issuing manifestos out there turns out, once he’s here, to be stupider than they are, isn’t that so? By your smile I can see that you approve.’","""Ah, you agree-I'm very glad; I knew beforehand that these were your own thoughts...

I've been caught again. You wouldn't say 'you're smart'- well, all right, I accept all that. Passons, as papa says, and, in parenthesis, don't be angry at my verbosity. Incidentally, here's an example for you: I always speak a lot, I mean, a lot of words, and I rush, and it always comes out wrong. And why is it that I speak a lot of words and it comes out wrong? Because I don't know how to speak. Those who know how to speak well, speak briefly. So, there you have my giftlessness-isn't it true? But since this gift of giftlessness is natural to me, why shouldn't I use it artificially? And so I do.

For pity's sake, who is going to start suspecting you of mysterious designs after that? No, there's not one of them who wouldn't be personally offended with anybody who said I had mysterious designs. And, what's more, I sometimes make them laugh-and that is priceless. No, they'll forgive me everything for this alone, that the wise man who published tracts there has turned out here to be stupider than they are, isn't that so?

"Ночь проходила. Шатова посылали, бранили, призывали, Marie дошла до последней степени страха за свою жизнь. Она кричала, что хочет жить «непременно, непременно!» и боится умереть. «Не надо, не надо!» – повторяла она. Если бы не Арина Прохоровна, то было бы очень плохо. Мало-помалу она совершенно овладела пациенткой. Та стала слушаться каждого слова ее, каждого окрика, как ребенок. Арина Прохоровна брала строгостью, а не лаской, зато работала мастерски. Стало рассветать. Арина Прохоровна вдруг выдумала, что Шатов сейчас выбегал на лестницу и богу молился, и стала смеяться. Marie тоже засмеялась злобно, язвительно, точно ей легче было от этого смеха. Наконец Шатова выгнали совсем. Наступило сырое, холодное утро. Он приник лицом к стене, в углу, точь-в-точь как накануне, когда входил Эркель. Он дрожал как лист, боялся думать, но ум его цеплялся мыслию за всё представлявшееся, как бывает во сне. Мечты беспрерывно увлекали его и беспрерывно обрывались, как гнилые нитки. Из комнаты раздались наконец уже не стоны, а ужасные, чисто животные крики, невыносимые, невозможные. Он хотел было заткнуть уши, но не мог и упал на колена, бессознательно повторяя: «Marie, Marie!» И вот наконец раздался крик, новый крик, от которого Шатов вздрогнул и вскочил с колен, крик младенца, слабый, надтреснутый. Он перекрестился и бросился в комнату. В руках у Арины Прохоровны кричало и копошилось крошечными ручками и ножками маленькое, красное, сморщенное существо, беспомощное до ужаса и зависящее, как пылинка, от первого дуновения ветра, но кричавшее и заявлявшее о себе, как будто тоже имело какое-то самое полное право на жизнь… Marie лежала как без чувств, но через минуту открыла глаза и странно, странно поглядела на Шатова: совсем какой-то новый был этот взгляд, какой именно, он еще понять был не в силах, но никогда прежде он не знал и не помнил у ней такого взгляда.","The night passed. Shatov was sent, scolded, called, Marie reached the last degree of fear for her life. She screamed that she wanted to live ""by all means, by all means!"" and afraid to die. ""Don't, don't!"" she repeated. If not for Arina Prokhorovna, it would be very bad. Little by little she took complete possession of the patient. She began to obey her every word, every cry, like a child. Arina Prokhorovna took severity, not affection, but she worked masterfully. It began to dawn. Arina Prokhorovna suddenly imagined that Shatov had just run out onto the stairs and prayed to God, and began to laugh. Marie, too, laughed angrily, caustically, as if this laugh made her feel better. Finally, Shatov was kicked out altogether. It was a wet, cold morning. He pressed his face against the wall, in the corner, just like the day before when Erkel came in. He trembled like a leaf, he was afraid to think, but his mind clung to everything imagined, as happens in a dream. Dreams kept captivating him and broke off incessantly like rotten threads. From the room came at last no longer groans, but terrible, purely animal cries, unbearable, impossible. He wanted to plug his ears, but could not, and fell to his knees, unconsciously repeating: ""Marie, Marie!"" And then at last there was a cry, a new cry, from which Shatov shuddered and jumped up from his knees, the cry of an infant, weak, cracked. He crossed himself and rushed into the room. In Arina Prokhorovna's hands, a small, red, shriveled creature, helpless to the point of horror and dependent, like a speck of dust, on the first breath of the wind, screamed and swarming with tiny arms and legs, but screaming and declaring itself, as if it also had some kind of the most complete right life... Marie lay as if unconscious, but a minute later she opened her eyes and looked strangely, strangely at Shatov: this look was completely new, what it was, he was still unable to understand, but never before had he known and never I remember that look from her.","The night was passing. Shatov was sent off, cursed, summoned. Marie was more afraid for her life than she had ever been. She shouted that she wanted to live, ‘absolutely, absolutely!’ and that she was afraid of dying. ‘ No, don’t, no, don’t!’ she kept repeating. If it hadn’t been for Arina Prokhorovna, things would have been very bad. Little by little she established complete domination over the patient. Marie began obeying her every word, her every order, like a child. Arina Prokhorovna got her way with strictness, not with kindness, but she worked masterfully. It began to grow light. Arina Prokhorovna suddenly imagined that Shatov had just run out on to the staircase and was praying to God, and she began to laugh. Marie also began to laugh, spitefully and bitterly, as if that sort of laughter made her feel better. Finally, Shatov was chased out altogether. A damp, cold morning broke. He leaned his face against the wall, in the corner, just as he had been doing the night before when Erkel came in. He was trembling like a leaf and was afraid to think, but his mind would catch at everything that presented itself, as is the case when one is dreaming. Daydreams were constantly distracting him and constantly breaking off like rotten threads. Finally, what came from the room was no longer moaning, but dreadful, sheer animal cries, unbearable, impossible. He thought of stopping up his ears, but couldn’t do so, and fell on his knees, unconsciously repeating: ‘Marie, Marie!’ And then there finally came a cry, a new cry, which made Shatov start and jump up from his knees. The cry of an infant, weak and broken. He crossed himself and dashed into the room. In Arina Prokhorovna’s arms was a small, red, wrinkled creature, crying and waving its arms and legs, terribly helpless, and as vulnerable as a speck of dust to the first puff of wind, but crying and giving notice of itself as if it also had every right to life. Marie was lying there seemingly insensible, but a moment later she opened her eyes and looked at Shatov strangely, ever so strangely: her look was somehow utterly new, though in precisely what way, he was incapable of understanding, but never before had he seen or remembered such a look on her face.","The night was passing. Shatov was sent out, abused, called back. Marie reached the last degree of fear for her life. She shouted that she wanted to live, that ""she must live, she must!"" and was afraid to die. "" Not that, not that!"" she kept repeating. Had it not been for Arina Prokhorovna, things would have been very bad. Gradually she gained complete control over the patient, who started obeying her every word, her every bark, like a child. Arina Prokhorovna used severity, not kindness, but her work was masterful. Dawn broke. Arina Prokhorovna suddenly came up with the idea that Shatov had just run out to the stairs to pray to God, and she began to laugh. Marie also laughed, spitefully, caustically, as if it made her feel better. Finally, they chased Shatov out altogether. A damp, cold morning came. He leaned his face to the wall in the corner, exactly as the evening before when Erkel came. He was trembling like a leaf, afraid to think, yet his thought clung to everything that presented itself to his mind, as happens in dreams. Reveries incessantly carried him away, and incessantly snapped off like rotten threads. Finally, it was no longer groans that came from the room, but terrible, purely animal sounds, intolerable, impossible. He wanted to stop his ears, but could not, and fell to his knees, unconsciously repeating ""Marie, Marie!"" And then, finally, there came a cry, a new cry, at which Shatov gave a start and jumped up from his knees, the cry of an infant, weak, cracked. He crossed himself and rushed into the room. In Arina Prokhorovna's hands a small, red, wrinkled being was crying and waving its tiny arms and legs, a terribly helpless being, like a speck of dust at the mercy of the first puff of wind, yet crying and proclaiming itself, as if it, too, somehow had the fullest right to life... Marie was lying as if unconscious, but after a minute she opened her eyes and gave Shatov a strange, strange look: it was somehow quite a new look, precisely how he was as yet unable to understand, but he did not know or remember her ever having such a look before."

"В шестьдесят третьем году ему как-то удалось отличиться; ему дали крестик и произвели в унтер-офицеры, а затем как-то уж скоро и в офицеры. Во всё это время Варвара Петровна отправила, может быть, до сотни писем в столицу с просьбами и мольбами. Она позволила себе несколько унизиться в таком необычайном случае. После производства молодой человек вдруг вышел в отставку, в Скворешники опять не приехал, а к матери совсем уже перестал писать. Узнали наконец, посторонними путями, что он опять в Петербурге, но что в прежнем обществе его уже не встречали вовсе; он куда-то как бы спрятался. Доискались, что он живет в какой-то странной компании, связался с каким-то отребьем петербургского населения, с какими-то бессапожными чиновниками, отставными военными, благородно просящими милостыню, пьяницами, посещает их грязные семейства, дни и ночи проводит в темных трущобах и бог знает в каких закоулках, опустился, оборвался и что, стало быть, это ему нравится. Денег у матери он не просил; у него было свое именьице – бывшая деревенька генерала Ставрогина, которое хоть что-нибудь да давало же доходу и которое, по слухам, он сдал в аренду одному саксонскому немцу. Наконец мать умолила его к ней приехать, и принц Гарри появился в нашем городе. Тут-то я в первый раз и разглядел его, а дотоле никогда не видывал.","In the sixty-third year he somehow managed to distinguish himself; he was given a cross and promoted to non-commissioned officer, and then, somehow, very soon, to officer. During all this time, Varvara Petrovna sent, perhaps, up to a hundred letters to the capital with requests and entreaties. She allowed herself to be somewhat humiliated on this extraordinary occasion. After the production, the young man suddenly retired, did not return to Skvoreshniki again, and completely stopped writing to his mother. They finally found out, by extraneous ways, that he was again in Petersburg, but that in his former society they no longer met him at all; he seemed to be hiding somewhere. They figured out that he lives in some strange company, got in touch with some scum of the St. God knows in what nooks and crannies, he sank, broke off, and that, therefore, he likes it. He did not ask his mother for money; he had his own estate - the former village of General Stavrogin, which at least gave some income, and which, according to rumors, he leased to a Saxon German. Finally, his mother begged him to come to her, and Prince Harry appeared in our city. It was then that I saw him for the first time, but I had never seen him before.","In 18635 he managed somehow to distinguish himself; they gave him a decoration and he was promoted to noncommissioned officer, and then, rather quickly somehow, to officer.

She was willing to demean herself somewhat in such extraordinary circumstances. After his promotion, the young man suddenly resigned his commission, did not return to Skvoreshniki and stopped writing to his mother altogether. Eventually it was learned, through third parties, that he was again in Petersburg, but that there was no longer any sign of him in his old haunts; he seemed to have hidden himself away somewhere. After inquiries, it was learned that he was living in strange company, that he had hooked up with the dregs of the Petersburg population, some down-at-heel government clerks, retired military officers who were genteel beggars, and drunkards, that he was visiting their filthy families, spending his days and nights in dark slums and in God only knows what back alleys, that he’d sunk very low, was all rags and tatters, and that he therefore found it all to his liking. He didn’t ask his mother for any money; he had his own small estate, the former country property of General Stavrogin, which after all did yield some income, and which, as rumour had it, he had rented out to a certain Saxon German.

It was discovered that he was living in some strange company, had become associated with some castoffs of the Petersburg populace, with some down-at-the-heel officials, retired military men who nobly begged for alms, drunkards, that he visited their dirty families, spent days and nights in dark slums and God knows what corners, that he had gone to seed, gone ragged, and that he apparently liked it. He did not ask money of his mother; he had his little estate-a former village of General Stavrogin's, which did bring at least some income and which, according to rumors, he had rented out to a German from Saxony. At last his mother begged a visit out of him, and Prince Harry appeared in our town. It was then that I first had a close look at him, for before then I had never seen him."

"Со словом три противники направились друг на друга. Гаганов тотчас же поднял пистолет и на пятом или шестом шаге выстрелил. На секунду приостановился и, уверившись, что дал промах, быстро подошел к барьеру. Подошел и Николай Всеволодович, поднял пистолет, но как-то очень высоко, и выстрелил совсем почти не целясь. Затем вынул платок и замотал в него мизинец правой руки. Тут только увидели, что Артемий Павлович не совсем промахнулся, но пуля его только скользнула по пальцу, по суставной мякоти, не тронув кости; вышла ничтожная царапина.

Then he took out a handkerchief and wrapped the little finger of his right hand in it. It was only then that they saw that Artemy Pavlovich had not completely missed, but his bullet only glided over his finger, over the articular pulp, without touching the bone; there was a minor scratch.

Then he took out a handkerchief and wrapped the little finger of his right hand in it. Only then could one see that Artemy Pavlovich had not missed entirely, but that his bullet had just grazed the soft flesh of the finger joint, without touching the bone.

В нестерпимой тоске, ежеминутно трепеща и удивляясь на самого себя, стеная и замирая попеременно, дожил он кое-как, запершись и лежа на диване, до одиннадцати часов утра следующего дня, и вот тут-то вдруг и последовал ожидаемый толчок, вдруг направивший его решимость. В одиннадцать часов, только что он отперся и вышел к домашним, он вдруг от них же узнал, что разбойник, беглый каторжный Федька, наводивший на всех ужас, грабитель церквей, недавний убийца и поджигатель, за которым следила и которого всё не могла схватить наша полиция, найден чем свет утром убитым, в семи верстах от города, на повороте с большой дороги на проселок, к Захарьину, и что о том говорит уже весь город. Тотчас же сломя голову бросился он из дому узнавать подробности и узнал, во-первых, что Федька, найденный с проломленною головой, был по всем признакам ограблен и, во-вторых, что полиция уже имела сильные подозрения и даже некоторые твердые данные заключить, что убийцей его был шпигулинский Фомка, тот самый, с которым он несомненно резал и зажег у Лебядкиных, и что ссора между ними произошла уже дорогой из-за утаенных будто бы Федькой больших денег, похищенных у Лебядкина… Липутин пробежал и в квартиру Петра Степановича и успел узнать с заднего крыльца, потаенно, что Петр Степанович хоть и воротился домой вчера, этак уже около часу пополуночи, но всю ночь преспокойно изволил почивать у себя дома вплоть до восьми часов утра. Разумеется, не могло быть сомнения, что в смерти разбойника Федьки ровно ничего не было необыкновенного и что таковые развязки именно всего чаще случаются в подобных карьерах, но совпадение роковых слов: «что Федька в последний раз в этот вечер пил водку», с немедленным оправданием пророчества было до того знаменательно, что Липутин вдруг перестал колебаться.

"Наконец, в апреле нынешнего года она получила письмо из Парижа, от генеральши Прасковьи Ивановны Дроздовой, подруги своего детства. В письме своем Прасковья Ивановна, – с которою Варвара Петровна не видалась и не переписывалась лет уже восемь, – уведомляла ее, что Николай Всеволодович коротко сошелся с их домом и подружился с Лизой (единственною ее дочерью) и намерен сопровождать их летом в Швейцарию, в Vernex-Montreux, несмотря на то что в семействе графа К… (весьма влиятельного в Петербурге лица), пребывающего теперь в Париже, принят как родной сын, так что почти живет у графа. Письмо было краткое и обнаруживало ясно свою цель, хотя кроме вышеозначенных фактов никаких выводов не заключало. Варвара Петровна долго не думала, мигом решилась и собралась, захватила с собою свою воспитанницу Дашу (сестру Шатова) и в половине апреля покатила в Париж и потом в Швейцарию. Воротилась она в июле одна, оставив Дашу у Дроздовых; сами же Дроздовы, по привезенному ею известию, обещали явиться к нам в конце августа.","Finally, in April of this year, she received a letter from Paris, from General Praskovya Ivanovna Drozdova, a friend of her childhood. In her letter, Praskovya Ivanovna—whom Varvara Petrovna had not seen or corresponded with for eight years—notified her that Nikolai Vsevolodovich had made friends with their house and made friends with Lisa (her only daughter) and intended to accompany them to Switzerland in the summer, to Vernex-Montreux, despite the fact that in the family of Count K ... (a very influential person in St. Petersburg), who is now in Paris, he is accepted as his own son, so that he almost lives with the count. The letter was short and clearly showed its purpose, although it did not conclude any conclusions apart from the above facts. Varvara Petrovna did not think for a long time, she instantly made up her mind and got ready, took her pupil Dasha (Shatov's sister) with her, and in the middle of April she drove to Paris and then to Switzerland. She returned alone in July, leaving Dasha with the Drozdovs; the Drozdovs themselves, according to the news brought by her, promised to come to us at the end of August.","Finally, in April of the present year, she received a letter from Paris, from Praskovya Ivanovna Drozdova, the widow of a general and her childhood friend.

(a highly influential personage in Petersburg), who was presently staying in Paris, and that he was almost living at the Count’s house. The letter was brief, and revealed its purpose clearly, although except for the above-mentioned facts, it drew no conclusions.

But the great day came and went, a certain period of time came and went, and the condescending smile again appeared on Stepan Trofimovich’s lips.

Платок спрыснул духами, впрочем лишь чуть-чуть, и, только завидел Варвару Петровну в окно, поскорей взял другой платок, а надушенный спрятал под подушку.","He immediately sent for me after her departure, and locked himself away from all the others for the whole day.

"Она сделала, однако, торжественный визит губернаторше.

Юлия Михайловна была польщена, но выдержала себя независимо. Она в ту пору уже очень начала себе чувствовать цену, даже, может быть, немного и слишком.

"Иногда даже мелочь поражает исключительно и надолго внимание.

И это там, где сам же он скопил себе «домишко», где во второй раз женился и взял за женой деньжонки, где, может быть, на сто верст кругом не было ни одного человека, начиная с него первого, хоть бы с виду только похожего на будущего члена «всемирно-общечеловеческой социальной республики и гармонии».","Sometimes even a trifle strikes exclusively and for a long time attention.

"Из лицея молодой человек в первые два года приезжал на вакацию. Во время поездки в Петербург Варвары Петровны и Степана Трофимовича он присутствовал иногда на литературных вечерах, бывавших у мамаши, слушал и наблюдал. Говорил мало и всё по-прежнему был тих и застенчив. К Степану Трофимовичу относился с прежним нежным вниманием, но уже как-то сдержаннее: о высоких предметах и о воспоминаниях прошлого видимо удалялся с ним заговаривать. Кончив курс, он, по желанию мамаши, поступил в военную службу и вскоре был зачислен в один из самых видных гвардейских кавалерийских полков. Показаться мамаше в мундире он не приехал и редко стал писать из Петербурга. Денег Варвара Петровна посылала ему не жалея, несмотря на то что после реформы доход с ее имений упал до того, что в первое время она и половины прежнего дохода не получала. У ней, впрочем, накоплен был долгою экономией некоторый, не совсем маленький капитал. Ее очень интересовали успехи сына в высшем петербургском обществе. Что не удалось ей, то удалось молодому офицеру, богатому и с надеждами. Он возобновил такие знакомства, о которых она и мечтать уже не могла, и везде был принят с большим удовольствием. Но очень скоро начали доходить к Варваре Петровне довольно странные слухи: молодой человек как-то безумно и вдруг закутил. Не то чтоб он играл или очень пил; рассказывали только о какой-то дикой разнузданности, о задавленных рысаками людях, о зверском поступке с одною дамой хорошего общества, с которою он был в связи, а потом оскорбил ее публично. Что-то даже слишком уж откровенно грязное было в этом деле. Прибавляли сверх того, что он какой-то бретер, привязывается и оскорбляет из удовольствия оскорбить. Варвара Петровна волновалась и тосковала. Степан Трофимович уверял ее, что это только первые, буйные порывы слишком богатой организации, что море уляжется и что всё это похоже на юность принца Гарри, кутившего с Фальстафом, Пойнсом и мистрис Квикли, описанную у Шекспира. Варвара Петровна на этот раз не крикнула: «Вздор, вздор!», как повадилась в последнее время покрикивать очень часто на Степана Трофимовича, а, напротив, очень прислушалась, велела растолковать себе подробнее, сама взяла Шекспира и с чрезвычайным вниманием прочла бессмертную хронику. Но хроника ее не успокоила, да и сходства она не так много нашла. Она лихорадочно ждала ответов на несколько своих писем. Ответы не замедлили; скоро было получено роковое известие, что принц Гарри имел почти разом две дуэли, кругом был виноват в обеих, убил одного из своих противников наповал, а другого искалечил и вследствие таковых деяний был отдан под суд. Дело кончилось разжалованием в солдаты, с лишением прав и ссылкой на службу в один из пехотных армейских полков, да и то еще по особенной милости.","From the lyceum, a young man in the first two years came to vacate. During Varvara Petrovna's and Stepan Trofimovich's trip to Petersburg, he sometimes attended literary evenings at his mother's, listened and observed. He spoke little and was still quiet and shy. He treated Stepan Trofimovich with the same tender attention, but somehow more restrained: he apparently retired from talking about lofty subjects and memories of the past. Having completed the course, he, at the request of his mother, entered the military service and was soon enrolled in one of the most prominent guards cavalry regiments. He did not come to show his mother in uniform and rarely began to write from St. Petersburg. Varvara Petrovna sent him money without sparing, despite the fact that after the reform the income from her estates fell to the point that at first she did not receive even half of her former income. She, however, had accumulated a certain, not quite small, capital through long-term savings. She was very interested in her son's success in high Petersburg society. What she failed, the young officer, rich and hopeful, succeeded. He resumed such acquaintances that she could no longer dream of, and was received everywhere with great pleasure. But very soon some rather strange rumors began to reach Varvara Petrovna: the young man was somehow madly and suddenly going on a rampage. Not that he played or drank heavily; they only talked about some kind of wild unbridledness, about people crushed by trotters, about a brutal act with one lady of good society, with whom he was in touch, and then insulted her publicly. Something even too frankly dirty was in this case. They added, in addition to the fact that he was some kind of brat, attached and offended for the pleasure of offending. Varvara Petrovna was agitated and grieved. Stepan Trofimovich assured her that these were only the first, violent impulses of a too rich organization, that the sea would calm down and that all this was similar to the youth of Prince Harry, who was reveling with Falstaff, Poins and Mistress Quickley, described by Shakespeare. This time Varvara Petrovna did not shout: ""Nonsense, nonsense!"", as she had lately been accustomed to shouting very often at Stepan Trofimovich, but, on the contrary, she listened very carefully, ordered to explain to herself in more detail, took Shakespeare herself and read the immortal chronicle with extreme attention. But the chronicle did not reassure her, and she did not find so many similarities. She feverishly waited for answers to several of her letters. The answers were not slow; soon the fatal news was received that Prince Harry had almost two duels at once, was guilty of both all around, killed one of his opponents on the spot, and crippled the other, and as a result of such acts was put on trial. The case ended with the demotion to the soldiers, with the deprivation of rights and exile to serve in one of the infantry army regiments, and even then by special mercy.","In the first two years the young man would come home on vacation from the lyceum. During the trip that Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovich took to Petersburg, he would sometimes be present at the literary soirees that were held at his mother’s, listening and observing. He said little and, as before, was quiet and shy. Towards Stepan Trofimovich he behaved tenderly and attentively, as before, but now in a somewhat more reserved way: he obviously kept away from discussions of lofty topics and reminiscences of the past with him. After completing his course of studies, he bowed to his mother’s wishes and entered military service and was soon posted to one of the most distinguished regiments of the horse guards.2 He did not come to show himself in uniform to his mother, and his letters from Petersburg grew infrequent. Varvara Petrovna sent him money unstintingly, despite the fact that after the reform the income from her estates fell so sharply that at first she did not take in even half of what she previously had. However, a long habit of economizing had enabled her to accumulate a not inconsiderable sum. She was very much interested in the success of her son in the highest circles of Petersburg society. Where she had not succeeded, the young officer, rich and with prospects, did succeed. He renewed acquaintanceships of which she could no longer even dream, and was everywhere received with great delight. But very soon rather strange rumours began to reach Varvara Petrovna; the young man had suddenly taken up a life of almost mad dissipation. It wasn’t that he was gambling or drinking a lot; what people were talking about was only a certain wildness and unruliness, people trampled by horses, the brutal treatment of a certain lady of good society with whom he had had a liaison and had then insulted publicly. There was something even too openly sordid about this affair. In addition, it was said that he had become a bully of sorts, attaching himself to people and then insulting them for the pleasure of it. Varvara Petrovna was upset and miserable. Stepan Trofimovich tried to reassure her that these were only the first stormy outbursts of a richly endowed nature, and that the sea would grow calm and that all this was like the youthful years of Prince Harry, who roistered with Falstaff, Poins and Mistress Quickly, as described by Shakespeare.3 On this occasion Varvara Petrovna didn’t shout ‘Rubbish, rubbish!’ as she had recently so often taken to shouting at Stepan Trofimovich, but on the contrary, listened carefully, ordered him to explain the details, picked up Shakespeare herself and read the immortal chronicle through with the closest attention. But the chronicle didn’t set her mind at ease, and besides, she didn’t find that much similarity. She feverishly awaited replies to several of her letters. The replies were not slow in coming; soon the fateful news arrived that Prince Harry had fought two duels almost at the same time, was entirely to blame for both, had killed one of his opponents outright and crippled the other, and as a result of these exploits had been put on trial. The upshot was a reduction to the ranks, with deprivation of his rights as a nobleman, and banishment to service in one of the army’s infantry regiments,4 and even that was only by special favour.","For the first two years the young man came home from the lycée for vacations.

Varvara Petrovna was worried and anguished. Stepan Trofimovich assured her that these were merely the first stormy impulses of an overabundant constitution, that the sea would grow calm, and that it all resembled Shakespeare's description of the youth of Prince Harry, carousing with Falstaff, Poins, and Mistress Quickly.1 This time Varvara Petrovna did not shout ""Nonsense, nonsense!"" as it had lately become her habit to shout quite often at Stepan Trofimovich, but, on the contrary, paid great heed to him, asked him to explain in more detail, herself took Shakespeare and read the immortal chronicle with extreme attention.

Одна странная мысль вдруг осенила Степана Трофимовича: «Не рассчитывает ли неутешная вдова на него и не ждет ли, в конце траурного года, предложения с его стороны?» Мысль циническая; но ведь возвышенность организации даже иногда способствует наклонности к циническим мыслям, уже по одной только многосторонности развития. Он стал вникать и нашел, что походило на то. Он задумался: «Состояние огромное, правда, но…» Действительно, Варвара Петровна не совсем походила на красавицу: это была высокая, желтая, костлявая женщина, с чрезмерно длинным лицом, напоминавшим что-то лошадиное. Всё более и более колебался Степан Трофимович, мучился сомнениями, даже всплакнул раза два от нерешимости (плакал он довольно часто). По вечерам же, то есть в беседке, лицо его как-то невольно стало выражать нечто капризное и насмешливое, нечто кокетливое и в то же время высокомерное. Это как-то нечаянно, невольно делается, и даже чем благороднее человек, тем оно и заметнее. Бог знает как тут судить, но вероятнее, что ничего и не начиналось в сердце Варвары Петровны такого, что могло бы оправдать вполне подозрения Степана Трофимовича. Да и не променяла бы она своего имени Ставрогиной на его имя, хотя бы и столь славное. Может быть, была всего только одна лишь женственная игра с ее стороны, проявление бессознательной женской потребности, столь натуральной в иных чрезвычайных женских случаях. Впрочем, не поручусь; неисследима глубина женского сердца даже и до сегодня! Но продолжаю.","May was in full bloom; the evenings were amazing. The bird cherry blossomed. Both friends met every evening in the garden and sat up to night in the gazebo, pouring out their feelings and thoughts to each other. The moments were poetic. Varvara Petrovna, under the impression of a change in her fate, spoke more than usual. She seemed to cling to the heart of her friend, and this went on for several evenings. One strange thought suddenly dawned on Stepan Trofimovich: ""Is the inconsolable widow counting on him and, at the end of the mourning year, waiting for an offer from him?"" The thought is cynical; but after all, the sublimity of the organization even sometimes contributes to a tendency to cynical thoughts, already in terms of the versatility of development alone. He began to delve and found what looked like it. He thought: “The condition is huge, it’s true, but ...” Indeed, Varvara Petrovna did not quite look like a beauty: she was a tall, yellow, bony woman, with an excessively long face, reminiscent of something like a horse. Stepan Trofimovich hesitated more and more, was tormented by doubts, even burst into tears a couple of times from indecision (he wept quite often). In the evenings, that is, in the gazebo, his face somehow involuntarily began to express something capricious and mocking, something coquettish and at the same time arrogant. This is done somehow by accident, involuntarily, and even the nobler the person, the more noticeable it is. God knows how to judge here, but it is more likely that nothing began in Varvara Petrovna's heart that could fully justify Stepan Trofimovich's suspicions. And she would not have exchanged her name Stavrogina for his name, even if it was so glorious. Perhaps there was only one womanly game on her part, a manifestation of an unconscious feminine need, so natural in other extreme female cases. However, I will not vouch; the depth of a woman's heart is unexplored even to this day! But I continue.","May was in full flower; the evenings were astonishing. The cherry trees were in bloom.

Varvara Petrovna, under the influence of the change in her life, talked more than usual. She clung to the heart of her friend, as it were, and several evenings passed in this manner. A strange thought suddenly flashed through Stepan Trofimovich’s mind: ‘ Isn’t the inconsolable widow counting on him, and isn’t she waiting for him to propose to her at the end of the year of mourning?’ A cynical thought; but the loftiness of a man’s constitution sometimes even fosters a tendency to cynical thoughts, if only by virtue of the many-sidedness of his spiritual development. He began to look deeper, and found something of the sort. He fell to thinking: ‘Her fortune is immense, true enough, but…’ In fact, Varvara Petrovna did not altogether resemble a beauty: she was a tall, yellow, bony woman, with an excessively long face reminiscent of a horse. Stepan Trofimovich grew increasingly hesitant, tormented himself with doubts, and twice even burst into tears of indecisiveness (he cried rather often). But in the evenings, that is, in the gazebo, his face involuntarily somehow began to express something capricious and mocking, something coquettish and at the same time haughty. This somehow happens accidentally and involuntarily, and in fact the more noble the person, the more noticeable it is. Lord knows how to judge matters in this case, but more likely than not, absolutely nothing was stirring in Varvara Petrovna’s heart that could fully justify Stepan Trofimovich ’s suspicions. And what’s more, she would certainly not change the name of Stavrogin for his name, however renowned it may be. Perhaps it was nothing more than just a feminine game on her part, the manifestation of an unconscious feminine need, which is so natural in some extremely feminine women.

"Долго стоял он в нерешимости со свечой в руке. В ту секунду, как отворял, он очень мало мог разглядеть, но, однако, мелькнуло лицо Кириллова, стоявшего в глубине комнаты у окна, и зверская ярость, с которою тот вдруг к нему кинулся. Петр Степанович вздрогнул, быстро поставил свечку на стол, приготовил револьвер и отскочил на цыпочках в противоположный угол, так что если бы Кириллов отворил дверь и устремился с револьвером к столу, он успел бы еще прицелиться и спустить курок раньше Кириллова.","For a long time he stood in indecision with a candle in his hand. At the moment he opened it, he could see very little, but, however, there flashed the face of Kirillov, who was standing in the back of the room by the window, and the bestial fury with which he suddenly rushed towards him. Pyotr Stepanovitch shuddered, quickly put the candle on the table, prepared the revolver, and jumped away on tiptoe to the opposite corner, so that if Kirillov had opened the door and rushed to the table with the revolver, he would still have had time to take aim and pull the trigger before Kirillov.","For a long time he stood indecisively with the candle in his hand.

Pyotr Stepanovich shuddered, quickly set the candle down on the table, cocked his revolver and sprang back on tiptoe to the opposite corner, so that if Kirillov opened the door and made a sudden move towards the table with his revolver, he would still have time to aim and pull the trigger before Kirillov did.","For a long time he stood indecisively, candle in hand.

Платон, Руссо, Фурье, колонны из алюминия – всё это годится разве для воробьев, а не для общества человеческого. Но так как будущая общественная форма необходима именно теперь, когда все мы наконец собираемся действовать, чтоб уже более не задумываться, то я и предлагаю собственную мою систему устройства мира. Вот она! – стукнул он по тетради. – Я хотел изложить собранию мою книгу по возможности в сокращенном виде; но вижу, что потребуется еще прибавить множество изустных разъяснений, а потому всё изложение потребует по крайней мере десяти вечеров, по числу глав моей книги.

Here she is! he tapped on the notebook. – I wanted to present my book to the assembly as abridged as possible; but I see that it will still be necessary to add a lot of verbal explanations, and therefore the whole exposition will require at least ten evenings, according to the number of chapters of my book. (Laughter is heard.) In addition, I announce in advance that my system is not finished. (Laughter again).

"– Тут не то-с, – ввязался, наконец, хромой. Вообще он говорил с некоторой как бы насмешливою улыбкой, так что, пожалуй, трудно было и разобрать, искренно он говорит или шутит. – Тут, господа, не то-с. Господин Шигалев слишком серьезно предан своей задаче и притом слишком скромен. Мне книга его известна. Он предлагает, в виде конечного разрешения вопроса, – разделение человечества на две неравные части. Одна десятая доля получает свободу личности и безграничное право над остальными девятью десятыми. Те же должны потерять личность и обратиться вроде как в стадо и при безграничном повиновении достигнуть рядом перерождений первобытной невинности, вроде как бы первобытного рая, хотя, впрочем, и будут работать. Меры, предлагаемые автором для отнятия у девяти десятых человечества воли и переделки его в стадо, посредством перевоспитания целых поколений, – весьма замечательны, основаны на естественных данных и очень логичны. Можно не согласиться с иными выводами, но в уме и в знаниях автора усумниться трудно. Жаль, что условие десяти вечеров совершенно несовместимо с обстоятельствами, а то бы мы могли услышать много любопытного.","“It’s not right here,” the lame man finally got involved.

He proposes, in the form of a final solution to the question, the division of mankind into two unequal parts. One tenth receives the freedom of the individual and an unlimited right over the other nine tenths. Those must lose their personality and turn, sort of, into a herd and, with boundless obedience, achieve a number of rebirths of primordial innocence, sort of like a primordial paradise, although, by the way, they will work. The measures proposed by the author for taking away the will of nine-tenths of humanity and remaking it into a herd, through the re-education of entire generations, are very remarkable, based on natural data and very logical. It is possible to disagree with other conclusions, but it is difficult to doubt the mind and knowledge of the author.

"Такое поведение оскорбляло несколько мое самолюбие. Само собою разумеется, что я давно уже угадал про себя эту главную тайну его и видел всё насквозь. По глубочайшему тогдашнему моему убеждению, обнаружение этой тайны, этой главной заботы Степана Трофимовича, не прибавило бы ему чести, и потому я, как человек еще молодой, несколько негодовал на грубость чувств его и на некрасивость некоторых его подозрений. Сгоряча – и, признаюсь, от скуки быть конфидентом – я, может быть, слишком обвинял его. По жестокости моей я добивался его собственного признания предо мною во всем, хотя, впрочем, и допускал, что признаваться в иных вещах, пожалуй, и затруднительно.

Пожалуй, раздражение мое было мелко и глупо; но взаимное уединение чрезвычайно иногда вредит истинной дружбе.

He also understood me through and through, that is, he clearly saw that I understood him through and through and was even angry with him, and he himself was angry with me because I was angry with him and understood him through and through.

In my cruelty, I tried to obtain a full confession from him, though, by the way, I did allow that to confess certain things might prove embarrassing. He, too, understood me thoroughly; that is, he clearly saw that I understood him thoroughly, and that I was even angry with him, and was himself angry with me for being angry with him and for understanding him thoroughly. Perhaps my irritation was petty and stupid; but shared isolation is sometimes extremely damaging to true friendship. From a certain angle he understood some aspects of his position correctly, and even defined it quite subtly in those points about which he did not find it necessary to be secretive."

"Это было в пятьдесят пятом году, весной, в мае месяце, именно после того как в Скворешниках получилось известие о кончине генерал-лейтенанта Ставрогина, старца легкомысленного, скончавшегося от расстройства в желудке, по дороге в Крым, куда он спешил по назначению в действующую армию.

Я сам за ними слежу, от себя-с. Нам уж трое известны: Шатов, Кириллов и тот подпоручик. Остальных я еще только разглядываю… впрочем, не совсем близорук. Это как в X—й губернии; там схвачено с прокламациями два студента, один гимназист, два двадцатилетних дворянина, один учитель и один отставной майор, лет шестидесяти, одуревший от пьянства, вот и всё, и уж поверьте, что всё; даже удивились, что тут и всё. Но надо шесть дней. Я уже смекнул на счетах; шесть дней, и не раньше.

If you want any result, do not move them for another six days, and I will tie them into one knot for you; but move it earlier - the nest will scatter. But give Shatov. I'm for Shatov... And it would be best to call him secretly and friendly, even here in the office, and examine him, lifting the veil before him... Yes, he will probably throw himself at your feet and cry!

"Ровно в полдень загремел оркестр. Будучи в числе распорядителей, то есть в числе двенадцати «молодых людей с бантом», я сам своими глазами видел, как начался этот позорной памяти день. Началось с непомерной давки у входа. Как это случилось, что всё оплошало с самого первого шагу, начиная с полиции? Я настоящую публику не виню: отцы семейств не только не теснились и никого не теснили, несмотря на чины свои, но, напротив, говорят, сконфузились еще на улице, видя необычайный по нашему городу напор толпы, которая осаждала подъезд и рвалась на приступ, а не просто входила. Меж тем экипажи всё подъезжали и наконец запрудили улицу. Теперь, когда пишу, я имею твердые данные утверждать, что некоторые из мерзейшей сволочи нашего города были просто проведены Лямшиным и Липутиным без билетов, а может быть, и еще кое-кем, состоявшими в распорядителях, как и я. По крайней мере явились даже совсем неизвестные личности, съехавшиеся из уездов и еще откуда-то. Эти дикари, только лишь вступали в залу, тотчас же в одно слово (точно их подучили) осведомлялись, где буфет, и, узнав, что нет буфета, безо всякой политики и с необычною до сего времени у нас дерзостию начинали браниться. Правда, иные из них пришли пьяные. Некоторые были поражены, как дикие, великолепием залы предводительши, так как ничего подобного никогда не видывали, и, входя, на минуту затихали и осматривались разиня рот. Эта большая Белая зала, хотя и ветхой уже постройки, была в самом деле великолепна: огромных размеров, в два света, с расписанным по-старинному и отделанным под золото потолком, с хорами, с зеркальными простенками, с красною по белому драпировкою, с мраморными статуями (какими ни на есть, но всё же статуями), с старинною, тяжелою, наполеоновского времени мебелью, белою с золотом и обитою красным бархатом. В описываемый момент в конце залы возвышалась высокая эстрада для имеющих читать литераторов, а вся зала сплошь была уставлена, как партер театра, стульями с широкими проходами для публики. Но после первых минут удивления начинались самые бессмысленные вопросы и заявления. «Мы, может быть, еще и не хотим чтения… Мы деньги заплатили… Публика нагло обманута… Мы хозяева, а не Лембки!..» Одним словом, точно их для этого и впустили. Особенно вспоминаю одно столкновение, в котором отличился вчерашний заезжий князек, бывший вчера утром у Юлии Михайловны, в стоячих воротничках и с видом деревянной куклы. Он тоже, по неотступной ее просьбе, согласился пришпилить к своему левому плечу бант и стать нашим товарищем-распорядителем. Оказалось, что эта немая восковая фигура на пружинах умела если не говорить, то в своем роде действовать. Когда к нему пристал один рябой колоссальный отставной капитан, опираясь на целую кучку всякой толпившейся за ним сволочи: куда пройти в буфет? – он мигнул квартальному. Указание было немедленно выполнено: несмотря на брань пьяного капитана, его вытащили из залы. Меж тем начала наконец появляться и «настоящая» публика и тремя длинными нитями потянулась по трем проходам между стульями. Беспорядочный элемент стал утихать, но у публики, даже у самой «чистой», был недовольный и изумленный вид; иные же из дам просто были испуганы.","At exactly noon the orchestra roared. Being among the stewards, that is, among the twelve ""young people with a bow"", I myself saw with my own eyes how this day of shameful memory began. It began with an exorbitant crush at the entrance. How did it happen that everything was screwed up from the very first step, starting with the police? I don’t blame the real public: the fathers of families not only did not crowd and did not crowd anyone, despite their ranks, but, on the contrary, they say, they were embarrassed even on the street, seeing the extraordinary pressure of the crowd in our city, which besieged the entrance and rushed to attack, and didn't just enter. Meanwhile, the carriages kept driving up, and at last the street was blocked. Now, as I am writing, I have solid evidence to assert that some of the vilest bastards of our city were simply carried away by Lyamshin and Liputin without tickets, and perhaps by someone else who was in the steward, like me. At least, even completely unknown personalities appeared, who had come from the districts and from somewhere else. These savages, as soon as they entered the hall, at once in a single word (as if they had been taught) inquired where the buffet was, and, having learned that there was no buffet, without any politics and with impudence unusual for us until now, they began to scold. True, some of them came drunk. Some were astounded, as if wild, by the magnificence of the leader's hall, since they had never seen anything like it, and, entering, they calmed down for a minute and looked around open-mouthed. This large White Hall, although it was already dilapidated, was really magnificent: huge, two-light, with a ceiling painted in the old fashioned way and trimmed in gold, with choirs, with mirrored walls, with red on white drapery, with marble statues (whatever they are, but still statues), with old, heavy, Napoleonic furniture, white and gold and upholstered in red velvet. At the moment described, at the end of the hall there was a high stage for writers who had to read, and the whole hall was completely lined, like the stalls of a theater, with chairs with wide aisles for the public. But after the first minutes of surprise, the most meaningless questions and statements began. “Perhaps we don’t want to read yet… We paid money… The public is impudently deceived… We are the masters, not the Lembki!…” In a word, that’s exactly why they were let in. I especially remember one collision in which yesterday's visiting prince distinguished himself, who was at Yulia Mikhailovna's yesterday morning, in standing collars and with the air of a wooden doll. He, too, at her persistent request, agreed to pin a bow to his left shoulder and become our comrade-manager. It turned out that this mute wax figure on springs was able, if not to speak, then in its own way to act. When one pockmarked, colossal retired captain leaned on him, leaning on a whole bunch of all the bastards crowding behind him: where to go to the buffet? he blinked at the quarterman. The instruction was immediately carried out: despite the scolding of the drunken captain, he was dragged out of the hall. Meanwhile, the “real” audience finally began to appear and stretched in three long threads along the three aisles between the chairs. The disorderly element began to subside, but the public, even the most ""clean"" one, had a displeased and astonished look; some of the ladies were simply frightened.","Precisely at noon the orchestra struck up. Being one of the stewards, that is, one of the twelve ‘young men with rosettes’, I myself saw with my own eyes how this day, which is so shameful to remember, began. It began with an incredible crush at the entrance. How did it happen that everything went wrong from the very first moment, beginning with the police? I don’t blame the real public. The fathers of families not only didn’t crowd each other or anyone else, despite their rank, but, on the contrary, it was said that they had been upset while they were still outside at the sight of the crowd’s pushing and shoving, which was unusual in our town, as it besieged the entrance and taking it by storm instead of simply going in. Meanwhile, carriages kept pulling up and finally blocked the street. Now, when I’m writing, I have solid grounds to affirm that several of the worst specimens of riff-raff in our town were simply brought in by Lyamshin and Liputin without tickets, and perhaps by others as well who, like me, were serving as stewards. In any case, some utterly unknown individuals, who had come in from the outlying districts and from other places as well, made their appearance. These savages, as soon as they set foot in the hall, immediately wanted to know, in one voice (as if they had been coached), where the buffet was, and on learning there was no buffet, began to curse, without any sense of propriety and with an insolence that had scarcely ever been heard before then among us. To be sure, some of them arrived drunk. Several were struck, like savages, by the magnificence of the marshal’s hall, since they had never seen anything like it, and as they went in, they fell silent for a moment and looked around open-mouthed. This large White Hall, although by now rather old and decrepit, was in fact magnificent: of enormous dimensions, with two rows of windows, a ceiling decorated in the old-fashioned way and trimmed with gold, with galleries, mirrors between the windows, red and white draperies, marble statues (undistinguished, but statues all the same), with heavy antique furniture of the Napoleonic period, white and gold and upholstered in red velvet. At the time I’m describing, a high platform had been erected at the end of the hall for the men of letters who were scheduled to read, and the entire hall, like the parterre of a theatre, was completely filled with chairs, with wide aisles for the public. But after the initial surprise, the most senseless questions and statements began. ‘Maybe we don’t want any reading yet… We’ve paid our money… The public has been brazenly cheated… We’re the ones in charge here, not the Lembkes!’ In short, it was as if they had been let in precisely for this purpose. I especially remember one clash, in which the young prince with the stand-up collar and the face of a wooden doll, who had arrived the day before and had been at Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s yesterday morning, distinguished himself. He had also agreed, at her insistent request, to pin the rosette to his left shoulder and become a steward along with the rest of us. It turned out that this mute wax figure on springs knew how if not to speak, then to act in his fashion. When a gigantic, pockmarked retired captain, supported by a whole band of all sorts of riff-raff crowding behind him, began to pester him by asking how to get to the buffet, the prince winked at a policeman. The hint was immediately taken: despite the cursing of the drunken captain, he was dragged out of the hall. Meanwhile, the ‘real’ public finally began to appear and stretched in three long lines down all three aisles between the chairs. The unruly element began to quiet down, but the public, even the ‘cleanest’ of them, had a dissatisfied and startled look; and some of the ladies were simply frightened.","At noon precisely the orchestra struck up. Being one of the ushers, that is, one of the twelve ""young men with a bow,"" I saw with my own eyes how this day of infamous memory began. It began with a boundless crush at the entrance. How did it happen that everything went amiss from the very first, beginning with the police? I do not blame the real public: fathers of families not only were not crowding each other or anyone else, even despite their rank, but, on the contrary, are said to have been abashed while still in the street at the sight, unusual for our town, of the shoving mob that was besieging the entrance and trying to force it, instead of simply going in. Meanwhile, carriages kept driving up and finally blocked the street. Now, as I write, I have solid grounds for affirming that some of the vilest scum of our town were simply brought in without tickets by Lyamshin and Liputin, and perhaps also by someone else who, like me, was one of the ushers. Anyway, even completely unknown persons appeared, who came from other districts and elsewhere. The moment these savages entered the hall, they would go at once to inquire, in the same words (as if they had been prompted), where the buffet was, and on learning that there was no buffet, would begin swearing without any politics and with a boldness hitherto unusual among us. True, some of them came drunk. Some were struck, like savages, by the magnificence of the marshal's wife's reception hall, since they had never seen anything like it, and, on entering, would become hushed for a moment and gaze around openmouthed. This big White Hall, despite its already decrepit structure, was indeed magnificent: of huge dimensions, with windows on both sides, with a ceiling decorated in the old manner and trimmed with gold, with galleries, with mirrors between the windows, with red and white draperies, with marble statues (such as they were, still they were statues), with heavy old furniture of the Napoleonic era, gilt white and upholstered in red velvet. At the moment described here, a high platform rose up at the end of the hall for the writers who were to read, and the entire room was completely filled with chairs, like the parterre of a theater, with wide aisles for the public. But after the first moments of astonishment, the most senseless questions and declarations would begin. ""Maybe we don't even want any reading... We paid money... The public has been brazenly deceived... We're the masters, not the Lembkas! ... "" In a word, as though it were for just this that they had been let in. I recall particularly one confrontation in which yesterday's visiting princeling distinguished himself, the one who had been at Yulia Mikhailovna's the previous morning, in his standing collar, and looking like a wooden doll. He, too, at her relentless request, had agreed to pin a bow to his left shoulder and become our fellow usher. It turned out that this mute wax figure on springs knew, if not how to speak, then at least, after a fashion, how to act. When one pockmarked, colossal retired captain, supported by a whole crew of various scum crowding at his back, began to pester him about ""where to get to the buffet""-he winked to a policeman. The directive was promptly fulfilled: in spite of his swearing, the drunken captain was dragged out of the hall. Meanwhile, the ""real"" public also began finally to appear and in three long lines threaded its way down the three aisles between the chairs. The disorderly element began to quiet down, but the public, even the ""cleanest"" part of it, had a displeased and amazed look; some of the ladies were quite simply frightened."

"Говорили, впрочем, мало, а более восклицали. Я немножко забыл теперь, как это всё происходило тогда по порядку, потому что вышла сумятица. Воскликнул что-то Степан Трофимович по-французски и сплеснул руками, но Варваре Петровне было не до него. Даже пробормотал что-то отрывисто и скоро Маврикий Николаевич. Но всех более горячился Петр Степанович; он в чем-то отчаянно убеждал Варвару Петровну, с большими жестами, но я долго не мог понять. Обращался и к Прасковье Ивановне и к Лизавете Николаевне, даже мельком сгоряча крикнул что-то отцу, – одним словом, очень вертелся по комнате. Варвара Петровна, вся раскрасневшись, вскочила было с места и крикнула Прасковье Ивановне: «Слышала, слышала ты, что он здесь ей сейчас говорил?» Но та уж и отвечать не могла, а только пробормотала что-то, махнув рукой. У бедной была своя забота: она поминутно поворачивала голову к Лизе и смотрела на нее в безотчетном страхе, а встать и уехать и думать уже не смела, пока не подымется дочь. Тем временем капитан, наверно, хотел улизнуть, это я подметил. Он был в сильном и несомненном испуге, с самого того мгновения, как появился Николай Всеволодович; но Петр Степанович схватил его за руку и не дал уйти.","They spoke, however, little, but more exclaimed. I have somewhat forgotten now how it all happened then in order, because there was confusion. Stepan Trofimovich exclaimed something in French and clasped his hands, but Varvara Petrovna had no time for him. Mavriky Nikolayevich even muttered something abruptly and quickly. But Pyotr Stepanovich was the most excited of all; he desperately tried to convince Varvara Petrovna of something, with great gestures, but for a long time I could not understand. He turned to both Praskovya Ivanovna and Lizaveta Nikolaevna, even briefly shouted something to his father in the heat of the moment - in a word, he turned around the room very much. Varvara Petrovna, flushed all over, jumped up from her seat and called out to Praskovya Ivanovna: “Did you hear, did you hear what he was saying to her just now?” But she could not answer, but only muttered something, waving her hand. The poor woman had her own worries: she turned her head to Lisa every minute and looked at her in unaccountable fear, but she no longer dared to get up and leave and think until her daughter got up. In the meantime, the captain probably wanted to sneak away, I noticed this. He was in a strong and undeniable fright, from the very moment Nikolai Vsevolodovich appeared; but Pyotr Stepanovitch seized him by the arm and did not let him go.","There was little actual talking, however, and more exclaiming. I don’t quite remember the order in which everything occurred, because there was such confusion. Stepan Trofimovich exclaimed something in French and clasped his hands together, but Varvara Petrovna paid him no mind. Even Mavriky Nikolayevich presently muttered something abruptly and quickly. But Pyotr Stepanovich was more worked up than anyone else: he was desperately trying to convince Varvara Petrovna of something, with broad gestures, but for a long time I couldn’t understand what he was saying. He also kept turning to Praskovya Ivanovna and Lizaveta Nikolayevna, and in a fit of temper even shouted something in passing at his father — in a word, he was spinning round the room like a top. Varvara Petrovna, all flushed, jumped up from her seat and shouted at Praskovya Ivanovna: ‘Did you hear, did you hear what he just said to her here?’ But Praskovya Ivanovna simply couldn’t come up with an answer, and only muttered something, waving her hand dismissively. The poor woman had her own troubles: she kept constantly turning her head towards Liza and looking at her in unaccountable fear, no longer daring even to think of getting to her feet and leaving until her daughter had got up. At the same time the captain most likely wanted to slip away, I could see that. He had been in a state of utter and unmistakable panic from the very moment Nikolay Vsevolodovich turned up; but Pyotr Stepanovich seized him by the arm and wouldn’t let him leave.","Or not talking so much as exclaiming.

"В том-то и была разница между ними, что Варвара Петровна никогда бы не послала такого письма. Правда, он писать любил без памяти, писал к ней, даже живя в одном с нею доме, а в истерических случаях и по два письма в день. Я знаю наверное, что она всегда внимательнейшим образом эти письма прочитывала, даже в случае и двух писем в день, и, прочитав, складывала в особый ящичек, помеченные и рассортированные; кроме того, слагала их в сердце своем. Затем, выдержав своего друга весь день без ответа, встречалась с ним как ни в чем не бывало, будто ровно ничего вчера особенного не случилось. Мало-помалу она так его вымуштровала, что он уже и сам не смел напоминать о вчерашнем, а только заглядывал ей некоторое время в глаза. Но она ничего не забывала, а он забывал иногда слишком уж скоро и, ободренный ее же спокойствием, нередко в тот же день смеялся и школьничал за шампанским, если приходили приятели. С каким, должно быть, ядом она смотрела на него в те минуты, а он ничего-то не примечал! Разве через неделю, через месяц, или даже через полгода, в какую-нибудь особую минуту, нечаянно вспомнив какое-нибудь выражение из такого письма, а затем и всё письмо, со всеми обстоятельствами, он вдруг сгорал от стыда и до того, бывало, мучился, что заболевал своими припадками холерины. Эти особенные с ним припадки, вроде холерины, бывали в некоторых случаях обыкновенным исходом его нервных потрясений и представляли собою некоторый любопытный в своем роде курьез в его телосложении.","That was the difference between them, that Varvara Petrovna would never have sent such a letter.

I know for sure that she always read these letters in the most attentive way, even in the case of two letters a day, and, having read it, put it in a special box, marked and sorted; besides, she composed them in her heart. Then, having withstood her friend all day without an answer, she met with him as if nothing had happened, as if nothing special had happened yesterday. Little by little she drilled him so that he himself no longer dared to remind her of yesterday, but only looked into her eyes for a while. But she did not forget anything, while he sometimes forgot too soon, and, encouraged by her calmness, often on the same day laughed and schooled over champagne if friends came. With what venom she must have looked at him in those moments, but he did not notice anything! Is it possible that a week later, a month later, or even half a year later, at some special moment, accidentally remembering some expression from such a letter, and then the whole letter, with all the circumstances, he would suddenly burn with shame, and it happened to be so he was tormented by his choleric attacks.

Then, after making her friend wait an entire day without an answer, she would meet him as if nothing at all were different, as if absolutely nothing out of the ordinary had occurred the day before. Little by little she trained him so well that he himself no longer dared even to mention what had happened the day before, but only kept glancing into her eyes now and again. But she forgot nothing, whereas he sometimes forgot much too quickly, and encouraged by her composure, would, that very same day, not infrequently laugh and behave like a schoolboy over the champagne if friends came to visit. The venomous looks she must have cast in his direction at such moments, while he noticed nothing at all! A week later, perhaps, or a month later, or even six months later, at some special moment, chancing to recall some phrase from one of these letters, and then in fact the entire letter, with all the accompanying circumstances, he would suddenly burn with shame and feel such torment that he would fall ill with one of his attacks of cholerine.18 These peculiar attacks of his, which resembled cholerine, were in some cases the natural result of shocks to his nervous system, and represented a certain feature, curious in its way, of his physical makeup.","And here lay the difference between them-Varvara Petrovna would never have sent such a letter.

Так как ей, ухаживая за больным, приходилось довольно часто входить и выходить из избы через хозяйскую комнату, то спавшие тут проезжие и хозяйка ворчали и даже начали под конец браниться, когда она вздумала под утро поставить самовар. Степан Трофимович всё время припадка был в полузабытьи; иногда как бы мерещилось ему, что ставят самовар, что его чем-то поят (малиной), греют ему чем-то живот, грудь. Но он чувствовал почти каждую минуту, что она была тут подле него; что это она приходила и уходила, снимала его с кровати и опять укладывала на нее. Часам к трем пополуночи ему стало легче; он привстал, спустил ноги с постели и, не думая ни о чем, свалился пред нею на пол. Это было уже не давешнее коленопреклонение; он просто упал ей в ноги и целовал полы ее платья…","During the night, Stepan Trofimovich suffered an attack of cholera, so well known to me and to all his friends, the usual outcome of all his nervous tensions and his moral upheavals.

Throughout his attack Stepan Trofimovich was in a state of semi-consciousness; sometimes he seemed to imagine that the samovar was being readied, that he was being given something to drink (raspberry tea), that his stomach and chest were being warmed with something. But he felt almost every minute that she was there beside him; that she was coming in and going out, lifting him off the bed and laying him down again. About three o’clock in the morning he felt better. He sat up, let his legs down from the bed and, without thinking of anything in particular, fell on the floor at her feet. He was not kneeling as he had done earlier; he simply fell at her feet and kissed the hem of her dress.","During the night, Stepan Trofimovich had an attack of that cholerine so well known to me and to all his friends-the usual outcome with him of any nervous strain or moral shock. Poor Sofya Matveevna did not sleep all night. Since, in tending to the sick man, she had to go in and out of the cottage fairly often through the proprietors' room, the guests and the mistress who were sleeping there kept grumbling and finally even began to curse when she decided towards morning to start the samovar. Stepan Trofimovich was half oblivious throughout the attack; at times he as if fancied that the samovar was being prepared, that he was being given something to drink (raspberry tea), that something warm was being put on his stomach, his chest. But he felt almost every moment that she was there by him; that it was she coming and going getting him out of bed and putting him back in. By three o'clock in the morning he felt better; he sat up, lowered his legs from the bed, and, not thinking of anything, collapsed on the floor in front of her. This was no longer the former kneeling; he simply fell at her feet and kissed the hem of her dress..."
"– Что ж, что я говорил, я другое дело! я, может, и верую, но только не совсем. Я хоть и не верую вполне, но все-таки не скажу, что бога расстрелять надо. Я, еще в гусарах служа, насчет бога задумывался. Во всех стихах принято, что гусар пьет и кутит; так-с, я, может, и пил, но, верите ли, вскочишь ночью с постели в одних носках и давай кресты крестить пред образом, чтобы бог веру послал, потому что я и тогда не мог быть спокойным: есть бог или нет? До того оно мне солоно доставалось! Утром, конечно, развлечешься, и опять вера как будто пропадет, да и вообще я заметил, что днем всегда вера несколько пропадает.","- Well, what I said, I'm another matter! I may believe, but not entirely. Although I do not fully believe, I still will not say that God should be shot. I, while still serving in the hussars, thought about God. In all verses it is accepted that the hussar drinks and revels; So, sir, I may have been drinking, but do you believe me, you jump out of bed at night in just your socks and let's baptize the crosses in front of the image so that God sends faith, because even then I could not be calm: is there a God or not? Before that, I got salty! In the morning, of course, you will have fun, and again faith will seem to disappear, and in general I noticed that in the afternoon faith always disappears somewhat.","‘Well, supposing I did, it’s an entirely different matter for me!

"Ho уже она принуждена петь с «Mein lieber Augustin» в один такт. Ее звуки как-то глупейшим образом переходят в «Augustin», она склоняется, погасает. Изредка лишь, прорывом, послышится опять «qu’un sang impur…», но тотчас же преобидно перескочит в гаденький вальс. Она смиряется совершенно: это Жюль Фавр, рыдающий на груди Бисмарка и отдающий всё, всё… Но тут уже свирепеет и «Augustin»: слышатся сиплые звуки, чувствуется безмерно выпитое пиво, бешенство самохвальства, требования миллиардов, тонких сигар, шампанского и заложников; «Augustin» переходит в неистовый рев… Франко-прусская война оканчивается. Наши аплодируют, Юлия Михайловна улыбается и говорит: «Ну как его прогнать?» Мир заключен. У мерзавца действительно был талантик. Степан Трофимович уверял меня однажды, что самые высокие художественные таланты могут быть ужаснейшими мерзавцами и что одно другому не мешает. Был потом слух, что Лямшин украл эту пиеску у одного талантливого и скромного молодого человека, знакомого ему проезжего, который так и остался в неизвестности; но это в сторону. Этот негодяй, который несколько лет вертелся пред Степаном Трофимовичем, представляя на его вечеринках, по востребованию, разных жидков, исповедь глухой бабы или родины ребенка, теперь уморительно карикатурил иногда у Юлии Михайловны, между прочим, и самого Степана Трофимовича, под названием «Либерал сороковых годов». Все покатывались со смеху, так что под конец его решительно нельзя было прогнать: слишком нужным стал человеком. К тому же он раболепно заискивал у Петра Степановича, который в свою очередь приобрел к тому времени уже до странности сильное влияние на Юлию Михайловну…","But already she is compelled to sing with ""Mein lieber Augustin"" in one measure. Her sounds somehow go into ""Augustin"" in the most stupid way, she bends down, fades out. Occasionally, only by a breakthrough, “qu’un sang impur…” will be heard again, but immediately it will jump into an ugly waltz. She resigns herself completely: this is Jules Favre, sobbing on Bismarck’s chest and giving everything, everything ... But here “Augustin” is already ferocious: hoarse sounds are heard, immensely drunk beer is felt, the frenzy of self-praise, the demands of billions, thin cigars, champagne and hostages; ""Augustin"" turns into a furious roar... The Franco-Prussian War ends. Our people applaud, Yulia Mikhailovna smiles and says: “Well, how to drive him away?” The world is closed. The bastard really had a talent. Stepan Trofimovich once assured me that the highest artistic talents can be the most terrible scoundrels and that one does not interfere with the other. Then there was a rumor that Lyamshin stole this piece from a talented and modest young man, a traveler he knew, who remained in obscurity; but that's aside. This scoundrel, who for several years hung around in front of Stepan Trofimovich, presenting at his parties, on demand, various liquids, the confession of a deaf woman or the homeland of a child, now sometimes hilariously caricatured at Yulia Mikhailovna, among other things, even Stepan Trofimovich himself, under the title ""Liberal of the Forties years."" Everyone rolled with laughter, so that in the end it was absolutely impossible to drive him away: he had become too necessary a person. In addition, he slavishly fawned over Pyotr Stepanovich, who, in turn, had acquired by that time already a strangely strong influence on Yulia Mikhailovna ...","But by now it was forced to sing in unison with Mein lieber Augustin. Its sounds somehow blended into Augustin in the silliest way imaginable; it languished and died out. Only occasionally could a snatch of ‘qu’un sang impur’ be heard, but it promptly passed back into the trashy little waltz in the most annoying way. Finally, it was completely subdued: it was Jules Favre sobbing on Bismarck’s breast and giving everything away, everything… But at this point Augustin turned savage as well: hoarse sounds were heard; there was an atmosphere of measureless quantities of beer being drunk, the fury of self-aggrandizement, demands for billions, fine cigars, champagne and hostages; Augustin now became a frenzied roar… The Franco-Prussian War was coming to an end. Everyone present applauded. Yuliya Mikhaylovna smiled and said, ‘Well, but how can we banish him now?’ Peace was concluded. This reprobate actually did have a modicum of talent. Stepan Trofimovich once assured me that the greatest artistic talents are capable of being the most dreadful reprobates and that the one does not preclude the other. Later it was rumoured that Lyamshin had stolen this little piece from a talented and modest young man, a visiting acquaintance of his, who simply remained unknown; but that’s neither here nor there. This scoundrel, who for several years had been hovering around Stepan Trofimovich, doing imitations at his evening parties, when called upon, of various miserable little Jews, the confession of a deaf woman or the birth of a child, would now sometimes produce killingly funny caricatures at Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s, among them one of Stepan Trofimovich himself, under the rubric ‘A Liberal of the 1840s’.6 Everyone would roar with laughter, the end result being that it was absolutely impossible to banish him: he had become too necessary. Besides, he slavishly fawned on Pyotr Stepanovich, who in turn had by then acquired a strangely powerful influence over Yuliya Mikhaylovna.","But now she is forced to sing in time with ""Mein lieber Augustin. "" Her strains somehow turn most stupidly into ""Augustin,"" she is drooping, dying out. Only an occasional outburst, ""qu'un sang impur . . ."" is heard again, but it jumps over at once, in a most vexing way, to the vile little waltz. She is thoroughly humbled: it is Jules Favre weeping on Bismarck's bosom and giving away everything, everything4... But then ""Augustin"" turns ferocious: one hears hoarse sounds, senses measureless quantities of beer being drunk, a frenzy of self-advertisement, demands for billions, slender cigars, champagne, and hostages; ""Augustin"" turns into a furious bellowing... The Franco-Prussian War is over. Our group applauds, Yulia Mikhailovna smiles and says: ""Well, how can one chase him out? "" Peace is made. The scoundrel did indeed have a bit of talent. Stepan Trofimovich once tried to convince me that the loftiest artistic talents can be the most terrible scoundrels, and that the one does not exclude the other. Rumor later had it that Lyamshin stole this little piece from a certain talented and modest young man, a visiting acquaintance of his, who remained unknown; but that is an aside. This blackguard, who for several years fluttered around Stepan Trofimovich, portraying on demand at his parties various little Jews, the confession of a deaf woman, or the birth of a child, now at Yulia Mikhailovna's produced killing caricatures, among them one of Stepan Trofimovich himself, entitled ""A Liberal of the Forties. "" Everyone rocked with laughter, so that by the end it was decidedly impossible to chase him out; he had become too necessary a person.

"На другой день, в два часа пополудни, предположенная дуэль состоялась. Быстрому исходу дела способствовало неукротимое желание Артемия Павловича Гаганова драться во что бы ни стало. Он не понимал поведения своего противника и был в бешенстве. Целый уже месяц он оскорблял его безнаказанно и всё еще не мог вывести из терпения. Вызов ему был необходим со стороны самого Николая Всеволодовича, так как сам он не имел прямого предлога к вызову. В тайных же побуждениях своих, то есть просто в болезненной ненависти к Ставрогину за фамильное оскорбление четыре года назад, он почему-то совестился сознаться. Да и сам считал такой предлог невозможным, особенно ввиду смиренных извинений, уже два раза предложенных Николаем Всеволодовичем. Он положил про себя, что тот бесстыдный трус; понять не мог, как тот мог снести пощечину от Шатова; таким образом и решился наконец послать то необычайное по грубости своей письмо, которое побудило наконец самого Николая Всеволодовича предложить встречу. Отправив накануне это письмо и в лихорадочном нетерпении ожидая вызова, болезненно рассчитывая шансы к тому, то надеясь, то отчаиваясь, он на всякий случай еще с вечера припас себе секунданта, а именно Маврикия Николаевича Дроздова, своего приятеля, школьного товарища и особенно уважаемого им человека. Таким образом, Кириллов, явившийся на другой день поутру в девять часов с своим поручением, нашел уже почву совсем готовую. Все извинения и неслыханные уступки Николая Всеволодовича были тотчас же с первого слова и с необыкновенным азартом отвергнуты. Маврикий Николаевич, накануне лишь узнавший о ходе дела, при таких неслыханных предложениях открыл было рот от удивления и хотел тут же настаивать на примирении, но, заметив, что Артемий Павлович, предугадавший его намерения, почти затрясся на своем стуле, смолчал и не произнес ничего. Если бы не слово, данное товарищу, он ушел бы немедленно; остался же в единственной надежде помочь хоть чем-нибудь при самом исходе дела. Кириллов передал вызов; все условия встречи, обозначенные Ставрогиным, были приняты тотчас же буквально, без малейшего возражения. Сделана была только одна прибавка, впрочем очень жестокая, именно: если с первых выстрелов не произойдет ничего решительного, то сходиться в другой раз; если не кончится ничем и в другой, сходиться в третий. Кириллов нахмурился, поторговался насчет третьего раза, но, не выторговав ничего, согласился, с тем, однако ж, что «три раза можно, а четыре никак нельзя». В этом уступили. Таким образом, в два часа пополудни и состоялась встреча в Брыкове, то есть в подгородной маленькой рощице между Скворешниками с одной стороны и фабрикой Шпигулиных – с другой. Вчерашний дождь перестал совсем, но было мокро, сыро и ветрено. Низкие мутные разорванные облака быстро неслись по холодному небу; деревья густо и перекатно шумели вершинами и скрипели на корнях своих; очень было грустное утро.","The next day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the supposed duel took place. The indomitable desire of Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov to fight at all costs contributed to the quick outcome of the case. He did not understand the behavior of his opponent and was furious. For a whole month now he had insulted him with impunity and still could not get out of patience. He needed a challenge from Nikolai Vsevolodovich himself, since he himself did not have a direct pretext for a challenge. For some reason, he was ashamed to confess to his secret motives, that is, simply to a painful hatred for Stavrogin for a family insult four years ago. Yes, and he himself considered such an excuse impossible, especially in view of the humble apologies that Nikolai Vsevolodovich had already offered twice. He put to himself that that shameless coward; could not understand how he could take a slap from Shatov; Thus, he finally decided to send that letter, unusual in its rudeness, which finally prompted Nikolai Vsevolodovich himself to propose a meeting. Having sent this letter the day before, and in feverish impatience awaiting a call, painfully calculating the chances for this, now hoping, now despairing, just in case, he had saved himself a second from the evening, namely Mavriky Nikolaevich Drozdov, his friend, school friend and especially respected person . Thus, Kirillov, who appeared the next morning at nine o'clock with his assignment, found the ground already quite ready. All the apologies and unheard-of concessions of Nikolai Vsevolodovich were immediately rejected from the first word and with extraordinary fervor. Mavriky Nikolayevich, who had only just learned the day before about the progress of the case, was about to open his mouth in surprise at such unheard-of proposals and wanted to immediately insist on reconciliation, but, noticing that Artemy Pavlovich, who had foreseen his intentions, was almost shaking in his chair, was silent and did not say anything. . Had it not been for the word given to the comrade, he would have left immediately; remained in the sole hope of helping in some way at the very end of the matter. Kirillov passed on the call; all the terms of the meeting outlined by Stavrogin were immediately accepted literally, without the slightest objection. Only one increase was made, however, a very cruel one, namely: if nothing decisive happens from the first shots, then converge another time; if it does not end in anything in the other, converge in the third. Kirillov frowned, bargained for a third time, but, without bargaining for anything, agreed, however, that ""three times is possible, but four is absolutely impossible."" They gave up on this. Thus, at two o'clock in the afternoon, a meeting took place in Brykovo, that is, in a small grove near the city between Skvoreshniki on the one hand and the Shpigulin factory on the other. Yesterday's rain stopped completely, but it was wet, damp and windy. Low, murky, torn clouds raced swiftly across the cold sky; the trees densely and erraticly rustled their tops and creaked on their roots; it was a very sad morning.","The next day, at two in the afternoon, the proposed duel took place. A quick outcome of the whole matter was made easier by Artemy Pavlovich’s unwavering desire to fight no matter what. He couldn’t understand his opponent’s behaviour, and was in a rage. For a full month now he had been insulting Stavrogin with impunity, and still couldn’t make him lose his patience. It was essential for him to be challenged by Nikolay Vsevolodovich, inasmuch as he himself had no direct pretext for issuing a challenge. And for some reason he was ashamed to admit to his secret motives, that is, simply put, his morbid hatred of Stavrogin for the insult to his family honour four years previously. Furthermore, he himself regarded such a pretext as impossible, especially in view of the humble apologies that had been offered by Nikolay Vsevolodovich on two occasions now. He had decided for himself that Stavrogin was a shameless coward; he failed to understand how he could have tolerated a slap in the face from Shatov; and so it was that he at last resolved to send that extraordinarily rude letter which finally prompted Nikolay Vsevolodovich himself to propose a meeting. After dispatching this letter the day before, and waiting in feverish impatience for a challenge, morbidly calculating the chances of receiving one, now hoping, now despairing, he had provided himself, just to be on the safe side, with a second the evening before, namely, Mavriky Nikolayevich Drozdov, his friend, his schoolmate, and a man for whom he had particular respect. So it was that Kirillov, who appeared the next morning at nine o’clock with his message, found the ground already fully prepared. All the apologies and the unprecedented concessions on the part of Nikolay Vsevolodovich were rejected immediately, from the very outset and with extraordinary heat. Mavriky Nikolayevich, who had learned just the day before of the course that this whole matter had taken, opened his mouth in astonishment at such unprecedented proposals, and wanted to insist on a reconciliation then and there, but observing that Artemy Pavlovich, who had an inkling of his intentions, was almost trembling in his seat, kept quiet and said nothing. If he hadn’t given his word to his friend, he would have left at once; but he remained, in the sole hope that he could be of some assistance at least in the final outcome of the whole affair. Kirillov conveyed the challenge; all the conditions of the encounter as outlined by Stavrogin were accepted immediately and literally, without the slightest objection. Only one addendum was made: and a very brutal one at that, namely, if the first shots yielded no definite outcome, then they were to take their places a second time; if the second encounter should be inconclusive, they would take their places a third time. Kirillov frowned and began to bargain about the third time, but not getting anywhere, he agreed, with the proviso, however, that ‘three times were possible, but four were absolutely impossible’. This was conceded. And so, at two o’clock in the afternoon, the encounter took place in Brykov, that is, in a small suburban grove between Skvoreshniki on the one side and the Shpigulin factory on the other. The previous day’s rain had completely stopped, but it was wet, damp and windy. Low, turbid, tattered clouds scudded across the cold sky; the treetops rolled and rustled heavily and their roots creaked; it was a very melancholy morning.","The next day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the proposed duel took place.1 The speedy outcome of the affair was furthered by Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov's indomitable desire to fight at all costs. He did not understand his adversary's conduct, and was furious. For a whole month he had been insulting him with impunity, and was still unable to make him lose patience. He needed a challenge from Nikolai Vsevolodovich, because he had no direct pretext for a challenge himself. And for some reason he was embarrassed to admit his secret motive-that is, simply a morbid hatred of Stavrogin for the family insult of four years ago. And he himself considered this pretext impossible, especially in view of the humble apologies already twice offered by Nikolai Vsevolodovich. Inwardly he set Stavrogin down as a shameless coward; he simply could not understand how he could suffer a slap from Shatov; and thus he finally resolved to send that letter, remarkable in its rudeness, which finally prompted Nikolai Vsevolodovich to suggest a meeting himself. Having sent this letter the day before, and awaiting the challenge with feverish impatience, morbidly reckoning up his chances for it, now hopeful, now despairing, he provided himself, just in case, on the previous evening, with a second-namely, Mavriky Nikolaevich Drozdov, his friend from school days and a man he particularly respected. So it was that when Kirillov came with his errand the next day at nine o'clock in the morning, he found the ground quite prepared. All the apologies and unheard-of concessions of Nikolai Vsevolodovich were rejected at once, from the first word, and with remarkable vehemence. Mavriky Nikolaevich, who had learned only the day before of the course the affair had taken, gaped in astonishment at such unheard-of offers, and wanted to insist at once on a reconciliation, but noticing that Artemy Pavlovich, who guessed his intentions, almost started shaking in his chair, he kept silent and said nothing. Had it not been for the word he had given his friend, he would have walked out immediately; he stayed solely in hopes of helping at least with something in the outcome of the affair. Kirillov conveyed the challenge; all the conditions stipulated for the meeting by Stavrogin were accepted at once, literally, without the least objection. Only one addition was made, albeit a very cruel one-namely, that if nothing decisive occurred at the first shots, they would begin over again; if it ended with nothing the second time, they would begin a third time. Kirillov frowned, bargained a little about the third time, but, having bargained unsuccessfully, agreed, on condition, however, that ""three times was possible, but four absolutely not."" This they conceded. And so, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the meeting took place at Brykovo, that is, a little woods outside town, between Skvoreshniki on one side and the Shpigulins' factory on the other. Yesterday's rain had stopped entirely, but it was wet, damp, and windy. Low, dull, broken clouds raced quickly across the cold sky; the trees rustled densely and rollingly at their tops, and creaked on their roots; the morning was very melancholy."

"Являлся на вечера и еще один молодой человек, некто Виргинский, здешний чиновник, имевший некоторое сходство с Шатовым, хотя, по-видимому, и совершенно противоположный ему во всех отношениях; но это тоже был «семьянин». Жалкий и чрезвычайно тихий молодой человек, впрочем лет уже тридцати, с значительным образованием, но больше самоучка. Он был беден, женат, служил и содержал тетку и сестру своей жены. Супруга его да и все дамы были самых последних убеждений, но всё это выходило у них несколько грубовато, именно – тут была «идея, попавшая на улицу», как выразился когда-то Степан Трофимович по другому поводу. Они всё брали из книжек и, по первому даже слуху из столичных прогрессивных уголков наших, готовы были выбросить за окно всё что угодно, лишь бы только советовали выбрасывать. Madame Виргинская занималась у нас в городе повивальною профессией; в девицах она долго жила в Петербурге. Сам Виргинский был человек редкой чистоты сердца, и редко я встречал более честный душевный огонь. «Я никогда, никогда не отстану от этих светлых надежд», – говаривал он мне с сияющими глазами. О «светлых надеждах» он говорил всегда тихо, с сладостию, полушепотом, как бы секретно. Он был довольно высокого роста, но чрезвычайно тонок и узок в плечах, с необыкновенно жиденькими, рыжеватого оттенка волосиками. Все высокомерные насмешки Степана Трофимовича над некоторыми из его мнений он принимал кротко, возражал же ему иногда очень серьезно и во многом ставил его в тупик. Степан Трофимович обращался с ним ласково, да и вообще ко всем нам относился отечески.","Another young man appeared at the evenings, a certain Virginsky, a local official who had some resemblance to Shatov, although, apparently, he was completely opposite to him in all respects; but it was also a ""family man"". A miserable and extremely quiet young man, however, already thirty years old, with a significant education, but more self-taught. He was poor, married, served and supported his wife's aunt and sister. His wife and all the ladies were of the latest convictions, but they all came out a little rudely, precisely - here was ""an idea that got into the street,"" as Stepan Trofimovich once put it on another occasion. They took everything from books and, according to the first rumor from our progressive corners of the capital, they were ready to throw anything out of the window, if only they were advised to throw it away. Madame Virginia was a midwife in our town; as a girl, she lived for a long time in St. Petersburg. Virginsky himself was a man of rare purity of heart, and rarely have I encountered a more honest spiritual fire. “I will never, never fall behind these bright hopes,” he used to say to me with shining eyes. About ""bright hopes"" he always spoke quietly, with sweetness, in a half-whisper, as if in secret. He was rather tall, but extremely thin and narrow in the shoulders, with unusually thin, reddish hair. All Stepan Trofimovich's arrogant sneers at some of his opinions he received meekly, but sometimes he objected to him very seriously and in many ways baffled him. Stepan Trofimovich treated him affectionately, and in general he treated us all like a father.","Another young man also used to appear at these soirees, one Virginsky, a local civil servant, who bore a certain resemblance to Shatov, even though to all appearances he was his complete opposite in every respect. But he was also a paterfamilias. He was a pathetic and extremely quiet young man, already almost thirty years old, with considerable education, but more self-taught than anything else. He was poor, married, employed in a government office, and the sole support of his aunt and his wife’s sister. His spouse and in fact all the ladies of the family held the very latest views, but all in a rather crude form, instances of ‘an idea that has ended up in the street’, as Stepan Trofimovich once put it in another context. They took everything out of books, and at even the first whisper from our progressive corners in the capital, were prepared to throw absolutely everything out of the window, provided they were advised to throw it out. Madame Virginskaya worked as a professional midwife in our town; as a young girl she had lived for a long time in Petersburg. Virginsky himself was a man of a rare purity of heart, and I have rarely met a soul that burned more brightly and honestly. ‘I shall never, ever forsake these radiant hopes,’ he would tell me with shining eyes. About his radiant hopes he would always speak quietly, sweetly, in almost a whisper, as if in secret. He was rather tall, but extremely thin and narrow in the shoulders, with extraordinarily fine, lanky hair of a reddish shade. All the condescending gibes that Stepan Trofimovich aimed at certain of his opinions he accepted meekly, but sometimes he came up with very serious objections and often painted him into a corner. Stepan Trofimovich treated him affectionately, and in general behaved like a father to us all.","There was yet another young man who used to come to the evenings, a certain Virginsky, a local official, who bore some resemblance to Shatov, though he was also apparently his complete opposite in all respects; but he was a ""family man"" as well.

They got everything out of books, and even at the first rumor from our progressive corners in the capital were prepared to throw anything whatsoever out the window, provided they were advised to throw it out. Madame Virginsky practiced the profession of midwife in our town; as a young girl, she had lived for a long time in Petersburg. Virginsky himself was a man of rare purity of heart, and rarely have I encountered a more honest flame of the soul. ""Never, never shall I abandon these bright hopes,"" he used to say to me, his eyes shining. Of these ""bright hopes"" he always spoke softly, with sweetness, in a half-whisper, as if secretly. He was quite tall but extremely skinny and narrow-shouldered, and had remarkably thin hair of a reddish hue. He bore meekly all of Stepan Trofimovich's scornful jibes at some of his opinions, and his objections to him were sometimes very serious and in many ways nonplussed him. Stepan Trofimovich treated him benignly, and generally took a fatherly attitude towards us all."

"Кириллов отворил боковую дверь в крошечную темную комнату; из этой комнаты тремя ступенями вниз сходили в кухню, прямо в ту отгороженную каморку, в которой обыкновенно помещалась кухаркина кровать. Здесь-то в углу, под образами, и сидел теперь Федька за тесовым непокрытым столом. На столе пред ним помещался полуштоф, на тарелке хлеб и на глиняной посудине холодный кусок говядины с картофелем. Он закусывал с прохладой и был уже вполпьяна, но сидел в тулупе и, очевидно, совсем готовый в поход. За перегородкой закипал самовар, но не для Федьки, а сам Федька обязательно раздувал и наставлял его, вот уже с неделю или более, каждую ночь для «Алексея Нилыча-с, ибо оченно привыкли, чтобы чай по ночам-с». Я сильно думаю, что говядину с картофелем, за неимением кухарки, зажарил для Федьки еще с утра сам Кириллов.","Kirillov opened a side door into a tiny dark room; from this room they descended three steps into the kitchen, straight into that enclosed closet in which the cook's bed was usually placed. It was here in the corner, under the images, that Fedka was now sitting at an uncovered board table. On the table in front of him was a half-damask, bread on a plate, and a cold piece of beef with potatoes on an earthenware vessel. He was having a cool snack and was already half drunk, but he was sitting in a sheepskin coat and, obviously, quite ready for a hike. Behind the partition, the samovar was boiling, but not for Fedka, but Fedka himself was sure to inflate and instruct it, for a week or more now, every night for ""Aleksey Nilych, sir, for they are very used to having tea at night, sir.""

"Но великий писатель действительно его ожидал, и даже еще вчера и третьего дня. Четвертого дня он вручил ему свою рукопись «Merci» (которую хотел прочесть на литературном утре в день праздника Юлии Михайловны) и сделал это из любезности, вполне уверенный, что приятно польстит самолюбию человека, дав ему узнать великую вещь заранее. Петр Степанович давно уже примечал, что этот тщеславный, избалованный и оскорбительно-недоступный для неизбранных господин, этот «почти государственный ум» просто-запросто в нем заискивает, и даже с жадностью. Мне кажется, молодой человек наконец догадался, что тот если и не считал его коноводом всего тайно-революционного в целой России, то по крайней мере одним из самых посвященных в секреты русской революции и имеющим неоспоримое влияние на молодежь. Настроение мыслей «умнейшего в России человека» интересовало Петра Степановича, но доселе он, по некоторым причинам, уклонялся от разъяснений.","But the great writer really expected him, and even yesterday and the third day. On the fourth day he handed him his manuscript ""Merci"" (which he wanted to read at the literary morning on the day of Yulia Mikhailovna's holiday) and did it out of courtesy, quite sure that he would pleasantly flatter the man's vanity by letting him know a great thing in advance. Pyotr Stepanovich had long noticed that this vain, spoiled and insultingly inaccessible gentleman to the unelected, this ""almost statesman's mind"" simply fawns on him, and even greedily. It seems to me that the young man finally guessed that if he did not consider him the leader of everything secretly revolutionary in the whole of Russia, then at least one of the most initiated into the secrets of the Russian revolution and having an undeniable influence on the youth. The mood of the thoughts of ""the smartest man in Russia"" interested Pyotr Stepanovich, but hitherto, for some reason, he shied away from explanations.","But the great writer actually was expecting him, even as early as the day before and the day before that. Three days earlier he had handed him the manuscript of ‘Merci’ (which he planned to read at the literary matinee on the day of Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s gala), and did so as a kindness, utterly convinced that he would pleasantly flatter the young man ’s vanity by letting him get to know the great work ahead of time. Pyotr Stepanovich had long noted that this vain and spoiled man, who was insultingly inaccessible to the non-elect, this ‘almost statesman-like mind’ was, purely and simply, trying to ingratiate himself with him, and even eagerly so. It seems to me that the young man finally figured out that Karmazinov, if he didn’t actually regard him as the ringleader of everything that was secretly revolutionary in Russia, at least saw him as one of the people who was most closely initiated into the secrets of the Russian revolution and had an unquestioned influence on young people. The state of mind of the ‘cleverest man in Russia’ interested Pyotr Stepanovich, but so far he, for certain reasons, had avoided getting into any discussions with him.","But the great writer was indeed expecting him, and had been even yesterday, and the day before.

Pyotr Stepanovich had long ago noticed that this gentleman, conceited, spoiled, and insultingly unapproachable for the non-elect, this ""all but statesmanly mind,"" was quite simply fawning on him, even eagerly so.

"В одно утро пронеслась по всему городу весть об одном безобразном и возмутительном кощунстве. При входе на нашу огромную рыночную площадь находится ветхая церковь Рождества богородицы, составляющая замечательную древность в нашем древнем городе. У врат ограды издавна помещалась большая икона богоматери, вделанная за решеткой в стену. И вот икона была в одну ночь ограблена, стекло киота выбито, решетка изломана и из венца и ризы было вынуто несколько камней и жемчужин, не знаю, очень ли драгоценных. Но главное в том, что кроме кражи совершено было бессмысленное, глумительное кощунство: за разбитым стеклом иконы нашли, говорят, утром живую мышь. Положительно известно теперь, четыре месяца спустя, что преступление совершено было каторжным Федькой, но почему-то прибавляют тут и участие Лямшина. Тогда никто не говорил о Лямшине и совсем не подозревали его, а теперь все утверждают, что это он впустил тогда мышь. Помню, всё наше начальство немного потерялось. Народ толпился у места преступления с утра. Постоянно стояла толпа, хоть не бог знает какая, но все-таки человек во сто. Одни приходили, другие уходили. Подходившие крестились, прикладывались к иконе; стали подавать, и явилось церковное блюдо, а у блюда монах, и только к трем часам пополудни начальство догадалось, что можно народу приказать и не останавливаться толпой, а, помолившись, приложившись и пожертвовав, проходить мимо. На фон Лембке этот несчастный случай произвел самое мрачное впечатление. Юлия Михайловна, как передавали мне, выразилась потом, что с этого зловещего утра она стала замечать в своем супруге то странное уныние, которое не прекращалось у него потом вплоть до самого выезда, два месяца тому назад, по болезни, из нашего города и, кажется, сопровождает его теперь и в Швейцарии, где он продолжает отдыхать после краткого своего поприща в нашей губернии.","One morning the news of an ugly and outrageous blasphemy swept through the whole city. At the entrance to our huge market square is the dilapidated Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, which is a remarkable antiquity in our ancient city. For a long time, a large icon of the Mother of God was placed at the gates of the fence, embedded behind bars into the wall. And so the icon was robbed in one night, the glass of the icon case was broken, the lattice was broken, and several stones and pearls were taken out of the crown and riza, I don’t know if they were very precious. But the main thing is that in addition to the theft, a senseless, mocking blasphemy was committed: behind the broken glass of the icon they found, they say, a live mouse in the morning. It is positively known now, four months later, that the crime was committed by convict Fedka, but for some reason Lyamshin's participation is also added here. Then no one spoke about Lyamshin and did not suspect him at all, and now everyone claims that it was he who let the mouse in then. I remember that all our bosses got a little lost. People have been crowding around the crime scene since morning. There was a constant crowd, although God knows what kind, but still a man in a hundred. Some came, others left. Those who approached were baptized, kissed the icon; they began to serve, and a church dish appeared, and a monk was at the dish, and only by three o'clock in the afternoon the authorities realized that it was possible to order the people and not stop in a crowd, but, after praying, kissing and sacrificing, pass by. On von Lembke this accident made the most gloomy impression. Yulia Mikhaylovna, as I was told, later expressed herself that from that ominous morning she began to notice in her husband that strange despondency, which did not stop with him until the very departure, two months ago, due to illness, from our city and, it seems , now accompanies him in Switzerland, where he continues to rest after his brief career in our province.","One morning news of a shocking and disgraceful sacrilege quickly spread through the entire town. At the entrance to our enormous marketplace stands the venerable church of Our Lady’s Nativity, which is a remarkable antiquity in our ancient town. At the gates of the enclosure, a large icon of the Mother of God had long ago been set into a wall behind a grating. And then, one night the icon was stolen, the glass of the icon-case broken, the grating smashed, and from the crown and the setting several stones and pearls removed, though I don’t know whether they were very valuable or not. But the main thing is that besides the theft, a senseless and sacrilegious act of desecration had been committed: behind the broken glass of the icon a live mouse was found the next morning, or so they say. Now, four months later, it’s definitely known that the crime was committed by the convict Fedka, but for some reason Lyamshin is also said to be involved. At the time no one mentioned Lyamshin and there was absolutely no reason to suspect him, but now everyone asserts that he was the one who let the mouse loose there. I remember that all our authorities rather lost their heads. From early morning a crowd of people had gathered at the scene of the crime. A crowd was constantly in attendance, just how big, Lord only knows, but at least a hundred people. Some were coming, others were going. As people arrived, they crossed themselves and kissed the icon; they began to make offerings, and a collection plate appeared, with a monk standing by the plate, and it was only at three o’clock in the afternoon that the authorities realized that the people could be told not to stand there in a crowd, but to move on, after they had said a prayer, kissed the icon and made a contribution. This unfortunate incident produced the gloomiest of impressions on von Lembke. Yuliya Mikhaylovna, as it was told to me, later said that from that ill-omened morning she had begun to notice in her husband the strange melancholy which subsequently persisted right up to the time of his departure from our town, two months ago, for reasons of ill health, and seems to be still with him even in Switzerland, where he continues to rest after his brief career in our province.","One morning the news swept through town of an ugly and outrageous blasphemy.

But I was struck most of all by the look of Lizaveta Nikolaevna from the moment Darya Pavlovna came in: hatred and contempt, much too unconcealed, flashed in her eyes."

"Но Лизавета Николаевна горячо отстаивала свой замысел, несмотря на трудность и неумелость высказаться. Книга должна быть одна, даже не очень толстая, – уверяла она. Но, положим, хоть и толстая, но ясная, потому что главное в плане и в характере представления фактов. Конечно, не всё собирать и перепечатывать. Указы, действия правительства, местные распоряжения, законы, всё это хоть и слишком важные факты, но в предполагаемом издании этого рода факты можно совсем выпустить. Можно многое выпустить и ограничиться лишь выбором происшествий, более или менее выражающих нравственную личную жизнь народа, личность русского народа в данный момент. Конечно, всё может войти: курьезы, пожары, пожертвования, всякие добрые и дурные дела, всякие слова и речи, пожалуй, даже известия о разливах рек, пожалуй, даже и некоторые указы правительства, но изо всего выбирать только то, что рисует эпоху; всё войдет с известным взглядом, с указанием, с намерением, с мыслию, освещающею всё целое, всю совокупность. И наконец, книга должна быть любопытна даже для легкого чтения, не говоря уже о том, что необходима для справок! Это была бы, так сказать, картина духовной, нравственной, внутренней русской жизни за целый год. «Нужно, чтобы все покупали, нужно, чтобы книга обратилась в настольную, – утверждала Лиза, – я понимаю, что всё дело в плане, а потому к вам и обращаюсь», – заключила она. Она очень разгорячилась, и, несмотря на то что объяснялась темно и неполно, Шатов стал понимать.","But Lizaveta Nikolaevna ardently defended her plan, despite the difficulty and inability to speak out. The book should be one, not even very thick, she assured. But, let's say, although thick, but clear, because the main thing is in the plan and in the nature of the presentation of facts. Of course, not everything is collected and reprinted. Decrees, actions of the government, local orders, laws, all this, though too important facts, but in the proposed edition of this kind of facts can be completely released. You can release a lot and confine yourself to a choice of incidents that more or less express the moral personal life of the people, the personality of the Russian people at the given moment. Of course, everything can enter: curiosities, fires, donations, all sorts of good and bad deeds, all sorts of words and speeches, perhaps even news of river floods, perhaps even some government decrees, but from everything choose only what depicts the era; everything will enter with a certain look, with an indication, with an intention, with a thought, illuminating the whole, the whole totality. And finally, the book should be interesting even for easy reading, not to mention necessary for reference! It would be, so to speak, a picture of the spiritual, moral, inner Russian life for a whole year. “It is necessary that everyone buys, it is necessary that the book turns into a desktop one,” Lisa argued, “I understand that the whole thing is in the plan, and therefore I am turning to you,” she concluded. She got very excited, and despite the fact that she explained herself obscurely and incompletely, Shatov began to understand.","But Lizaveta Nikolayevna hotly defended her scheme, despite her difficulty and her inadequacy in expressing herself. There ought to be only one book, not even very thick, she insisted. But even supposing it were thick, it would be clear, because the main thing was the plan and the way the facts were presented. Of course, not everything could be collected and reprinted. Official decrees, government acts, local ordinances, laws — all were very important facts, to be sure, but facts of this kind could be omitted altogether from her proposed publication. One could omit a great deal and limit oneself just to a selection of the events which more or less reflected the personal moral life of the people, the personality of the Russian people at a given moment. Of course, everything could go in: curious incidents, fires, donations, all kinds of good and bad things, all kinds of statements and speeches, perhaps even reports of floods, perhaps even certain government decrees as well, but only things that depicted the times should be selected from all this. Everything included would reflect a certain point of view, a direction, an intention, an idea that illuminates the facts as a whole, the sum total. And finally, the book should be interesting even as light reading, not to speak of the fact that it should be essential as a reference tool! This would be, so to speak, a picture of the spiritual, moral inner life of Russians over the course of an entire year. ‘Everyone should buy it, the book should become a household item everywhere,’ Liza affirmed. ‘I understand that it’s all a matter of the way it’s planned, and that’s why I’m turning to you,’ she concluded. She was flushed with excitement, and even though her explanations were unclear and incomplete, Shatov began to understand.","But Lizaveta Nikolaevna hotly defended her project in spite of its difficulty and her inexperience in talking about it. There should be one book, and not even a very fat one, she insisted. But even supposing it were a fat one, still it would be a clear one, because the main thing was the plan and the way the facts were presented. Of course, not everything was to be collected and reproduced. Government decrees and acts, local directives, laws-all facts of that sort, though important, could be entirely omitted from the proposed volume. A great deal could be omitted, and the choice could be limited only to events that more or less expressed the personal moral life of the people, the personality of the Russian people at a given moment. Of course, anything could be included: curiosities, fires, donations, all sorts of good and bad deeds, all sorts of pronouncements and speeches, perhaps even news about flooded rivers, perhaps even some government decrees as well, but with the choice only of those things that portrayed the epoch; everything would be included with a certain view, a direction, an intention, an idea, throwing light on the entire whole, the totality. And, finally, the book should be interesting even as light reading, to say nothing of its being an indispensable reference work! It would be, so to speak, a picture of the spiritual, moral, inner life of Russia over an entire year. ""Everyone should want to buy it, the book should become a household item,"" Liza kept affirming. ""I realize that the whole thing depends on the plan, and that is why I'm turning to you,"" she concluded. She was quite flushed, and though her explanations were obscure and incomplete, Shatov began to understand."

"Многие из дам (и из самых светских) любопытствовали и о «загадочной хромоножке» – так называли Марью Тимофеевну. Нашлись даже пожелавшие непременно увидать ее лично и познакомиться, так что господа, поспешившие припрятать Лебядкиных, очевидно, поступили и кстати. Но на первом плане все-таки стоял обморок Лизаветы Николаевны, и этим интересовался «весь свет», уже по тому одному, что дело прямо касалось Юлии Михайловны, как родственницы Лизаветы Николаевны и ее покровительницы. И чего-чего не болтали! Болтовне способствовала и таинственность обстановки; оба дома были заперты наглухо; Лизавета Николаевна, как рассказывали, лежала в белой горячке; то же утверждали и о Николае Всеволодовиче, с отвратительными подробностями о выбитом будто бы зубе и о распухшей от флюса щеке его. Говорили даже по уголкам, что у нас, может быть, будет убийство, что Ставрогин не таков, чтобы снести такую обиду, и убьет Шатова, но таинственно, как в корсиканской вендетте. Мысль эта нравилась; но большинство нашей светской молодежи выслушивало всё это с презрением и с видом самого пренебрежительного равнодушия, разумеется напускного. Вообще древняя враждебность нашего общества к Николаю Всеволодовичу обозначилась ярко. Даже солидные люди стремились обвинить его, хотя и сами не знали в чем. Шепотом рассказывали, что будто бы он погубил честь Лизаветы Николаевны и что между ними была интрига в Швейцарии. Конечно, осторожные люди сдерживались, но все, однако же, слушали с аппетитом. Были и другие разговоры, но не общие, а частные, редкие и почти закрытые, чрезвычайно странные и о существовании которых я упоминаю лишь для предупреждения читателей, единственно ввиду дальнейших событий моего рассказа. Именно: говорили иные, хмуря брови и бог знает на каком основании, что Николай Всеволодович имеет какое-то особенное дело в нашей губернии, что он чрез графа К. вошел в Петербурге в какие-то высшие отношения, что он даже, может быть, служит и чуть ли не снабжен от кого-то какими-то поручениями. Когда очень уж солидные и сдержанные люди на этот слух улыбались, благоразумно замечая, что человек, живущий скандалами и начинающий у нас с флюса, не похож на чиновника, то им шепотом замечали, что служит он не то чтоб официально, а, так сказать, конфиденциально и что в таком случае самою службой требуется, чтобы служащий как можно менее походил на чиновника. Такое замечание производило эффект; у нас известно было, что на земство нашей губернии смотрят в столице с некоторым особым вниманием. Повторю, эти слухи только мелькнули и исчезли бесследно, до времени, при первом появлении Николая Всеволодовича; но замечу, что причиной многих слухов было отчасти несколько кратких, но злобных слов, неясно и отрывисто произнесенных в клубе недавно возвратившимся из Петербурга отставным капитаном гвардии Артемием Павловичем Гагановым, весьма крупным помещиком нашей губернии и уезда, столичным светским человеком и сыном покойного Павла Павловича Гаганова, того самого почтенного старшины, с которым Николай Всеволодович имел, четыре с лишком года тому назад, то необычайное по своей грубости и внезапности столкновение, о котором я уже упоминал прежде, в начале моего рассказа.","Many of the ladies (and of the most secular ones) were also curious about the “mysterious lame-foot” - that was the name of Marya Timofeevna. There were even those who wished to see her personally and get to know her, so that the gentlemen who hurried to hide the Lebyadkins obviously did the right thing. But Lizaveta Nikolaevna's fainting still stood in the foreground, and ""the whole world"" was interested in this, for the sole reason that the matter directly concerned Yulia Mikhailovna, as a relative of Lizaveta Nikolaevna and her patroness. And they didn't talk about anything! Chatter was also facilitated by the mysteriousness of the situation; both houses were locked tightly; Lizaveta Nikolaevna, as they said, was in delirium tremens; the same was said about Nikolai Vsevolodovich, with disgusting details about a tooth that was allegedly knocked out and about his cheek swollen from the flux. They even said in the corners that we might have a murder, that Stavrogin was not the kind to endure such an insult, and would kill Shatov, but mysteriously, as in a Corsican vendetta. I liked this idea; but the majority of our secular youth listened to all this with contempt and with an air of the most scornful indifference, of course, a pretense. In general, the ancient hostility of our society to Nikolai Vsevolodovich was clearly marked. Even respectable people tried to accuse him, although they themselves did not know what. They whispered that he had ruined the honor of Lizaveta Nikolaevna and that there had been an intrigue between them in Switzerland. Of course, the cautious people restrained themselves, but everyone, however, listened with gusto. There were other conversations, but not general, but private, rare and almost closed, extremely strange and the existence of which I mention only to warn readers, solely in view of the further events of my story. Namely: others said, frowning their brows, and God knows on what basis, that Nikolai Vsevolodovich had some special business in our province, that he, through Count K., entered into some kind of higher relations in Petersburg, that he even, perhaps, serves and is almost supplied with some kind of assignments from someone. When very respectable and restrained people smiled at this rumor, prudently remarking that a person who lives in scandals and starts with a gumboil does not look like an official with us, then they were noticed in a whisper that he serves not only officially, but, so to speak, confidentially, and that in this case the service itself requires that the employee resemble an official as little as possible. Such a remark produced an effect; we knew that the Zemstvos of our province were looked upon in the capital with some special attention. I repeat, these rumors only flickered and disappeared without a trace, for the time being, at the first appearance of Nikolai Vsevolodovich; but I note that the cause of many rumors was partly a few brief but spiteful words vaguely and abruptly uttered in a club by the retired captain of the guard Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov, who recently returned from St. , that same respectable foreman with whom Nikolai Vsevolodovich had, more than four years ago, that clash, unusual in its rudeness and suddenness, which I already mentioned before, at the beginning of my story.","Many of the ladies (even from the highest society) were also curious about the ‘mysterious cripple’, as they called Marya Timofeyevna. There were even those who were intent on seeing her in person and making her acquaintance, so that the gentlemen who had hastened to hide the Lebyadkins away had obviously done the right thing. But the main topic was Lizaveta Nikolayevna’s fainting spell, and this was a matter of interest to all of society, if only for the fact that it directly involved Yuliya Mikhaylovna, as Lizaveta Nikolayevna’s relative and protectress. And the things they chattered on about! The chattering was fed by the mysterious nature of the situation: both houses were shut uptight; Lizaveta Nikolayevna, as people were reporting, was confined to her bed in a state of delirium; the same thing was affirmed about Nikolay Vsevolodovich as well, with disgusting details about a tooth that supposedly had been knocked out and a swollen, abscessed cheek. In certain little corners it was even said that we would perhaps have a murder, that Stavrogin was not the kind of man to tolerate such an insult, and would kill Shatov, but secretly, as in a Corsican vendetta.1 This idea had its appeal, but the majority of our fashionable young people listened to all this with contempt and with an air of the most disdainful indifference, which was of course a sham. In general, the ancient enmity that our society felt towards Nikolay Vsevolodovich was clearly evident. Even serious-minded people were eager to accuse him, although of what, they themselves didn’t know. It was whispered that he had compromised the honour of Lizaveta Nikolayevna, and that they had had an affair in Switzerland. Cautious people of course held back, but everyone nevertheless listened with relish. Other things were said as well, though not in public, but in private, on rare occasions and almost in secret, extremely strange things, the existence of which I mention merely by way of warning readers, and solely in view of the events that lie ahead in my narrative. Namely, some were saying, knitting their brows and Lord knows on what grounds, that Nikolay Vsevolodovich had some special business in our province, that through Count K. he had made some higher connections in Petersburg, that he was perhaps even in government service and had come all but entrusted with some special mission by someone. When very serious-minded and restrained people smiled at this rumour, sensibly noting that a man who lived for scandal and had begun his stay in town with a swollen cheek didn’t look like a government official, people whispered back that he wasn’t exactly working in an official capacity, but confidentially,2 so to speak, and that in such a case the very nature of his work required that the person in question should look as little like a government official as possible. Such an observation produced an effect; it was known in our town that the zemstvo3 in our province was being watched with some special attention in the capital. Let me repeat: these rumours merely flared up and then disappeared without a trace, when Nikolay Vsevolodovich first came on the scene; but let me note that the cause of many of the rumours was to some extent the few but spiteful words that had been vaguely and abruptly spoken in the club by a retired Guards captain, Artemy Pavlovich Gaganov, who had recently returned from Petersburg. He was a very large landowner in our province and district, a man who circulated in the higher circles of the capital, and the son of the late Pavel Pavlovich Gaganov, the very same respected senior member of our club, with whom Nikolay Vsevolodovich, more than four years ago, had had a clash that was extraordinary for its coarseness and unexpectedness, and which I have previously mentioned, at the beginning of my story.","Many of the ladies (and of the best society) were also curious about the ""mysterious lame girl""-as they called Marya Timofeevna. There were some who even insisted on seeing her in person and making her acquaintance, so that those gentlemen who had hastened to tuck the Lebyadkins away had obviously acted opportunely. But in the forefront still stood Lizaveta Nikolaevna's swoon, and ""all society"" was interested in that, if only because the matter directly concerned Yulia Mikhailovna, as Lizaveta Nikolaevna's relation and patroness. And the chattering that went on! The mysteriousness of the situation was conducive to chatter : both homes were shut tight; Lizaveta Nikolaevna was said to be lying in brain fever; the same was also asserted of Nikolai Vsevolodovich, with repugnant details about a tooth that had supposedly been knocked out and a swollen cheek. In some little corners it was even said that there would perhaps be a murder, that Stavrogin was not a man to bear with such an offense, and that he would kill Shatov, but secretly, as in a Corsican vendetta. This idea was liked; but the majority of our young society people listened to it all with disdain and an air of the most scornful indifference-assumed, of course. In general, the ancient hostility of our society towards Nikolai Vsevolodovich was markedly evident. Even the most solid people were eager to accuse him, though they themselves did not know of what. It was whispered that he had supposedly ruined Lizaveta Nikolaevna's honor, and that there had been an affair between them in Switzerland. Of course, cautious people restrained themselves, and yet everyone listened with appetite.

"Этот Шигалев, должно быть, уже месяца два как гостил у нас в городе; не знаю, откуда приехал; я слышал про него только, что он напечатал в одном прогрессивном петербургском журнале какую-то статью. Виргинский познакомил меня с ним случайно, на улице. В жизнь мою я не видал в лице человека такой мрачности, нахмуренности и пасмурности. Он смотрел так, как будто ждал разрушения мира, и не то чтобы когда-нибудь, по пророчествам, которые могли бы и не состояться, а совершенно определенно, так-этак послезавтра утром, ровно в двадцать пять минут одиннадцатого. Мы, впрочем, тогда почти ни слова и не сказали, а только пожали друг другу руки с видом двух заговорщиков. Всего более поразили меня его уши неестественной величины, длинные, широкие и толстые, как-то особенно врозь торчавшие. Движения его были неуклюжи и медленны. Если Липутин и мечтал когда-нибудь, что фаланстера могла бы осуществиться в нашей губернии, то этот наверное знал день и час, когда это сбудется.

Virginsky introduced me to him by chance, on the street. In my life I have never seen in the face of a man such gloominess, frown and cloudiness. He looked as if he was waiting for the destruction of the world, and not that someday, according to prophecies that might not have come true, but quite definitely, so-and-so, the day after tomorrow morning, exactly at twenty-five minutes past ten. However, at that time we hardly said a word, but only shook hands with the air of two conspirators. What struck me most of all were his ears of unnatural size, long, wide and thick, sticking out somehow especially apart. His movements were clumsy and slow. If Liputin ever dreamed that the phalanstere could be realized in our province, then this one probably knew the day and hour when it would come true. He made an ominous impression on me: having now met him at Shatov's, I was surprised, especially since Shatov was generally not a fan of guests.","This Shigalyov must have been staying in our town for some two months by then.

Never in my life have I seen such gloom, moroseness and sullenness on a person’s face.

Она с унижением и с улыбками, при всем своем высокомерии, пробовала заговорить с иными дамами, но те тотчас терялись, отделывались односложными, недоверчивыми «да-с» и «нет-с» и видимо ее избегали.","Yes, it was her fault again! Probably just now, when, after my flight, it was decided to go to the ball with Pyotr Stepanovich and be at the ball, she probably again went to the office of Andrey Antonovich, already completely “shocked” at the “reading”, again used all her seductions and attracted him with her . But how she must have suffered now! And yet she didn't leave! Whether pride tormented her or she was simply lost, I don’t know. With humiliation and smiles, with all her arrogance, she tried to talk to other ladies, but they immediately lost their heads, got off with monosyllabic, distrustful ""yes"" and ""no"" and apparently avoided her.","Yes, she was guilty again! Earlier in the day, when I had run off, when she and Pyotr Stepanovich had decided that there must be a ball and that she must attend the ball, she probably went into Andrey Antonovich’s study, after he had been ‘shaken’ at the ‘reading’, again employed all her blandishments and persuaded him to come along with her. But how she must have been suffering now! And yet she was making no move to leave! Whether she was tormented by pride or had simply lost her head, I don’t know. For all her haughtiness, she did try, with humiliation and smiles, to strike up a conversation with some of the ladies, but they immediately became flustered, escaped with monosyllabic and wary ‘yes, ma’am’ and ‘no, ma’am’, and were obviously trying to avoid her.","Yes, again she was to blame! Probably earlier, when, after my flight, she and Pyotr Stepanovich had decided that the ball would be and that she would be at the ball-probably she had gone again to the study of Andrei Antonovich, now finally ""shaken"" at the ""reading,"" again employed all her seductions, and thus drew him along with her. But how tormented she must have been now! And still she would not leave! Whether she was tormented by pride, or was simply lost-I do not know. For all her haughtiness, she did try with humiliation and smiles to make conversation with some of the ladies, but they at once became confused, got off with a laconic, mistrustful ""yes, ma'am"" or ""no, ma'am,"" and visibly avoided her."

"Пока оставили при нем Эркеля. Надо было спешить с мертвецом: было столько крику, что могли где-нибудь и услышать. Толкаченко и Петр Степанович подняли фонари, подхватили труп под голову; Липутин и Виргинский взялись за ноги и понесли. С двумя камнями ноша была тяжела, а расстояние более двухсот шагов. Сильнее всех был Толкаченко. Он было подал совет идти в ногу, но ему никто не ответил, и пошли как пришлось. Петр Степанович шел справа и, совсем нагнувшись, нес на своем плече голову мертвеца, левою рукой снизу поддерживая камень. Так как Толкаченко целую половину пути не догадался помочь придержать камень, то Петр Степанович наконец с ругательством закричал на него. Крик был внезапный и одинокий; все продолжали нести молча, и только уже у самого пруда Виргинский, нагибаясь под ношей и как бы утомясь от ее тяжести, вдруг воскликнул опять точно таким же громким и плачущим голосом:","So far they have left Erkel with him. We had to hurry with the dead man: there was so much screaming that they could have been heard somewhere. Tolkachenko and Pyotr Stepanovich raised the lanterns, grabbed the corpse under the head; Liputin and Virginsky took hold of their legs and carried them off. With two stones, the burden was heavy, and the distance was more than two hundred paces. Tolkachenko was the strongest of all. He was about to give advice to keep pace, but no one answered him, and they went as they had to. Pyotr Stepanovich walked to the right and, bending down completely, carried the dead man's head on his shoulder, supporting the stone with his left hand from below. Since Tolkachenko did not think of helping to hold the stone for a whole half of the way, Pyotr Stepanovich finally shouted at him with a curse. The cry was sudden and lonely; everyone continued to carry it in silence, and only by the very pond Virginsky, bending under the burden and as if weary of its weight, suddenly exclaimed again in exactly the same loud and weeping voice:","They left Erkel with him for the time being.

He tried to advise them to move in step, but no one responded, and they set off walking any which way.

"Кириллов ничего не знал о намерениях насчет Шатова, да и прежде никогда не знал о всей степени опасности, ему угрожающей. Знал только, что у него какие-то старые счеты с «теми людьми», и хотя сам был в это дело отчасти замешан сообщенными ему из-за границы инструкциями (впрочем, весьма поверхностными, ибо близко он ни в чем не участвовал), но в последнее время он всё бросил, все поручения, совершенно устранил себя от всяких дел, прежде же всего от «общего дела», и предался жизни созерцательной. Петр Верховенский в заседании хотя и позвал Липутина к Кириллову, чтоб удостовериться, что тот примет в данный момент «дело Шатова» на себя, но, однако, в объяснениях с Кирилловым ни слова не сказал про Шатова, даже не намекнул, – вероятно считая неполитичным, а Кириллова даже и неблагонадежным, и оставив до завтра, когда уже всё будет сделано, а Кириллову, стало быть, будет уже «всё равно»; по крайней мере так рассуждал о Кириллове Петр Степанович. Липутин тоже очень заметил, что о Шатове, несмотря на обещание, ни слова не было упомянуто, но Липутин был слишком взволнован, чтобы протестовать.","Kirillov knew nothing about Shatov's intentions, and he had never before known the full extent of the danger threatening him.

Although Pyotr Verkhovensky at the meeting called Liputin to Kirillov to make sure that he would take over the “Shatov case” at the moment, however, in his explanations with Kirillov, he did not say a word about Shatov, did not even hint - probably considering it unpolitical , and Kirillov even unreliable, and leaving until tomorrow, when everything will be done, and Kirillov, therefore, will already ""do not care""; at least this is how Pyotr Stepanovich talked about Kirillov. Liputin also remarked very much that, despite the promise, not a word was mentioned about Shatov, but Liputin was too excited to protest.","Kirillov knew nothing about what was intended for Shatov now, nor had he known earlier the full extent of the danger that threatened him.

Although at the meeting Pyotr Verkhovensky had summoned Liputin to go with him to Kirillov’s to ascertain whether Kirillov would take the ‘Shatov matter’ on himself at the given moment, he had not said a word about Shatov in his discussions with Kirillov, even by way of a hint. He probably considered it impolitic and Kirillov even unreliable, and he put it off until the following day when everything would have been done and when it would therefore ‘make no difference’ to Kirillov. At least, that was Pyotr Stepanovich’s reasoning about Kirillov. Liputin was also very much aware that not a word had been said about Shatov, despite Pyotr Stepanovich’s promise, but Liputin was too upset to protest.","Kirillov knew nothing about the intentions concerning Shatov, and even before he never knew the full extent of the danger that threatened him.

Теперь, когда приходилось решаться на такое дело, он злился более всех наших, вместе взятых.

"Варвара Петровна была ужасно поражена. Она призналась потом Степану Трофимовичу, что всё это она давно предугадывала, все эти полгода каждый день, и даже именно в «этом самом роде» – признание замечательное со стороны родной матери. «Началось!» – подумала она содрогаясь. На другое утро после рокового вечера в клубе она приступила, осторожно, но решительно, к объяснению с сыном, а между тем вся так и трепетала, бедная, несмотря на решимость. Она всю ночь не спала и даже ходила рано утром совещаться к Степану Трофимовичу и у него заплакала, чего никогда еще с нею при людях не случалось. Ей хотелось, чтобы Nicolas по крайней мере хоть что-нибудь ей сказал, хоть объясниться бы удостоил. Nicolas, всегда столь вежливый и почтительный с матерью, слушал ее некоторое время насупившись, но очень серьезно; вдруг встал, не ответив ни слова, поцеловал у ней ручку и вышел. А в тот же день, вечером, как нарочно, подоспел и другой скандал, хотя и гораздо послабее и пообыкновеннее первого, но тем не менее, благодаря всеобщему настроению, весьма усиливший городские вопли.","Varvara Petrovna was terribly amazed. She later confessed to Stepan Trofimovich that she had foreseen all this for a long time, all these six months every day, and even precisely in ""this very kind"" - a remarkable confession from her own mother. ""Began!"" she thought shudderingly. The next morning after the fateful evening at the club, she began, cautiously but decisively, to explain to her son, but meanwhile she was all trembling, poor, despite her determination. She did not sleep all night, and even went early in the morning to confer with Stepan Trofimovitch, and she burst into tears at his place, which had never happened to her before in public. She wanted Nicolas to at least say something to her, at least deign to explain herself. Nicolas, always so polite and respectful to his mother, listened to her for a while frowning, but very seriously; suddenly got up, without answering a word, kissed her hand and went out. And on the same day, in the evening, as if on purpose, another scandal arose, although much weaker and more ordinary than the first, but nevertheless, thanks to the general mood, it greatly increased the cries of the city.","Varvara Petrovna was dreadfully shaken.

Nicolas, who was always so courteous and respectful towards his mother, listened to her for a time, frowning but very serious. Suddenly he got up, without having uttered a word in reply, kissed her hand and walked out.

Now, three months later, our society has rested, relaxed, recovered, acquired its own opinion, so much so that some even regard Pyotr Stepanovich himself almost as a genius, at least as having ""abilities of genius."" ""Organization, sir!"" they say in the club, raising a finger aloft. However, all this is quite innocent, and, besides, those who say it are not many. Others, on the contrary, do not deny him acuteness of abilities, but couple it with a total ignorance of reality, a terrible abstractedness, a dull and deformed one-sidedness of development, and, proceeding from all that, an extraordinary light-mindedness. Concerning his moral aspects everyone agrees; here there is no argument."
"Прибытие их к роковому дому произошло именно в то самое мгновение, когда сбившаяся пред домом густая толпа уже довольно наслушалась о Ставрогине и о том, как выгодно было ему зарезать жену. Но все-таки, повторяю, огромное большинство продолжало слушать молча и неподвижно. Выходили из себя лишь пьяные горланы да люди «срывающиеся», вроде как тот махавший руками мещанин. Его все знали как человека даже тихого, но он вдруг как бы срывался и куда-то летел, если что-нибудь известным образом поражало его. Я не видел, как прибыли Лиза и Маврикий Николаевич. Впервой я заметил Лизу, остолбенев от изумления, уже далеко от меня в толпе, а Маврикия Николаевича даже сначала и не разглядел. Кажется, был такой миг, что он от нее отстал шага на два за теснотой или его оттерли. Лиза, прорывавшаяся сквозь толпу, не видя и не замечая ничего кругом себя, словно горячечная, словно убежавшая из больницы, разумеется, слишком скоро обратила на себя внимание: громко заговорили и вдруг завопили. Тут кто-то крикнул: «Это ставрогинская!» И с другой стороны: «Мало что убьют, глядеть придут!» Вдруг я увидел, что над ее головой, сзади, поднялась и опустилась чья-то рука; Лиза упала. Раздался ужасный крик Маврикия Николаевича, рванувшегося на помощь и ударившего изо всех сил заслонявшего от него Лизу человека. Но в тот же самый миг обхватил его сзади обеими руками тот мещанин. Несколько времени нельзя было ничего разглядеть в начавшейся свалке. Кажется, Лиза поднялась, но опять упала от другого удара. Вдруг толпа расступилась, и образовался небольшой пустой круг около лежавшей Лизы, а окровавленный, обезумевший Маврикий Николаевич стоял над нею, крича, плача и ломая руки. Не помню в полной точности, как происходило дальше; помню только, что Лизу вдруг понесли. Я бежал за нею; она была еще жива и, может быть, еще в памяти. Из толпы схватили мещанина и еще трех человек. Эти трое до сих пор отрицают всякое свое участие в злодеянии, упорно уверяя, что их захватили ошибкой; может, они и правы. Мещанин, хоть и явно уличенный, но, как человек без толку, до сих пор еще не может разъяснить обстоятельно происшедшего. Я тоже, как очевидец, хотя и отдаленный, должен был дать на следствии мое показание: я заявил, что всё произошло в высшей степени случайно, через людей, хотя, может быть, и настроенных, но мало сознававших, пьяных и уже потерявших нитку. Такого мнения держусь и теперь.","Their arrival at the fateful house took place precisely at the very moment when the dense crowd that had gathered in front of the house had already heard enough about Stavrogin and how profitable it was for him to kill his wife. But still, I repeat, the vast majority continued to listen in silence and motionless. Only drunken bawlers lost their temper and people “broke out”, sort of like that tradesman waving his arms. Everyone knew him as a man, even a quiet one, but he would suddenly, as it were, break loose and fly somewhere if something struck him in a certain way. I did not see how Liza and Mavriky Nikolaevich arrived. For the first time I noticed Liza, dumbfounded with amazement, already far from me in the crowd, but I didn’t even make out Mavriky Nikolaevich at first. It seems that there was such a moment that he was two steps behind her due to tightness, or he was wiped away. Liza, who was breaking through the crowd, not seeing or noticing anything around her, like a fever, as if she had run away from the hospital, of course, drew attention to herself too soon: they started talking loudly and suddenly screamed. Then someone shouted: ""This is Stavrogin's!"" And on the other hand: “They won’t kill much, they’ll come to look!” Suddenly I saw that above her head, from behind, someone's hand rose and fell; Lisa fell. There was a terrible cry from Mavriky Nikolaevich, who rushed to help and struck with all his strength the man who was shielding Liza from him. But at the same moment that tradesman grabbed him from behind with both hands. For some time it was impossible to see anything in the beginning of the dump. It seems that Lisa got up, but fell again from another blow. Suddenly the crowd parted, and a small empty circle formed around the lying Lisa, and the bloody, distraught Mavriky Nikolaevich stood over her, screaming, crying and wringing his hands. I do not remember exactly what happened next; I only remember that Liza was suddenly carried away. I ran after her; she was still alive and perhaps still remembered. A tradesman and three other people were seized from the crowd. These three still deny any participation in the atrocity, stubbornly assuring that they were captured by mistake; maybe they are right. The tradesman, although clearly convicted, but, as a person without any sense, still cannot explain in detail what happened. I, too, as an eyewitness, albeit a distant one, had to give my testimony at the investigation: I declared that everything happened in the highest degree by chance, through people, although perhaps in the mood, but little conscious, drunk and already lost the thread. I still hold this opinion.","Their arrival at the fatal house occurred precisely at the moment when the large crowd gathered before the house had heard a great deal about Stavrogin and about how it was to his advantage to murder his wife. But still and all, I repeat, the vast majority continued to listen in silence and without moving. The only people who were out of control were loud-mouthed drunkards and ‘unhinged’ types like that tradesman who was waving his arms. Everyone knew him as a quiet man, but he would suddenly become rather unhinged and fly off on a tangent if something struck him in a certain way. I didn’t see Liza and Mavriky Nikolayevich arrive. Stunned with amazement, I first noticed Liza already standing in the crowd at some distance from me, but in the beginning I didn’t even discern Mavriky Nikolayevich. I think there must have been a moment when he fell a couple of steps behind her, or was pushed back. Liza, who was trying to press her way through the crowd, not seeing or noticing anything around her, like someone in a fever, like someone who had escaped from a hospital, very quickly of course attracted attention: people began talking loudly and then howling. Suddenly someone shouted: ‘It’s Stavrogin’s woman!’ Then: ‘It’s not enough for them to commit murder, they have to come and look!’ Suddenly I saw someone’s hand raised above her head from behind, and then it came down; Liza fell. Mavriky Nikolayevich let out a dreadful cry and rushed to help her, hitting with all his strength a man who was trying to block his way. But at that very instant the tradesman grabbed him from behind with both hands. For some time it was impossible to make anything out in the scuffle that ensued. Liza seemed to get up, but fell again from another blow. Suddenly the crowd parted, and a small empty circle formed around the prostrate Liza with the bloody, crazed Mavriky Nikolayevich standing over her, shouting, crying and wringing his hands. I don’t remember with absolute accuracy what happened then; I remember only that Liza was suddenly carried away. I ran after her; she was still alive and perhaps still conscious. The tradesman and three other men in the crowd were seized. To this day these three deny any part in the evil deed, stubbornly insisting that they were arrested by mistake; perhaps they are actually right. The tradesman, though clearly guilty, is a man of limited understanding, and to this day cannot give a coherent explanation of what happened. As an eyewitness, albeit a distant one, I had to give evidence at the inquest: I stated that everything had happened quite accidentally, the work of people who, though perhaps incited, were scarcely aware of what they were doing as they were drunk and disorderly. I hold this opinion even now.","Their arrival at the fatal house occurred precisely at the moment when the thick crowd thronging in front of the house had heard a good deal about Stavrogin and how it was profitable for him to kill his wife.

I first noticed Liza, to my stupefied amazement, when she was already far away from me in the crowd, and in the beginning I did not even make out Mavriky Nikolaevich. It seems there was a moment when he lagged a couple of steps behind her because of the crowd, or else he was forced aside. Liza, who was tearing through the crowd without seeing or noticing anything around her, like someone in a fever, like someone escaped from a hospital, of course drew attention to herself all too quickly: there was loud talk and suddenly shouting. Then someone yelled: ""That's Stavrogin's woman!"" And from the other side: ""They don't just kill, they also come and look!""

I, too, had to give my evidence at the investigation, as a witness, though a distant one: I declared that everything had happened to the highest degree by chance, through people who, though perhaps of a certain inclination, had very little awareness, were drunk, and had already lost the thread.

"Николай Всеволодович запер дверь, положил ключ в карман и пошел по проулку, увязая с каждым шагом вершка на три в грязь. Он вышел наконец в длинную и пустынную улицу на мостовую. Город был известен ему как пять пальцев; но Богоявленская улица была всё еще далеко. Было более десяти часов, когда он остановился наконец пред запертыми воротами темного старого дома Филипповых. Нижний этаж теперь, с выездом Лебядкиных, стоял совсем пустой, с заколоченными окнами, но в мезонине у Шатова светился огонь. Так как не было колокольчика, то он начал бить в ворота рукой.

He finally came out into the long and deserted street onto the pavement. The city was known to him like five fingers; but Epiphany Street was still far away. It was over ten o'clock when he finally stopped in front of the locked gates of the dark old Filippovs' house. The lower floor now, with the Lebyadkins' departure, stood completely empty, with the windows boarded up, but a fire shone on Shatov's mezzanine. Since there was no bell, he began to beat the gate with his hand.

"Петр Степанович взял особую комнату. Липутин гневливо и обидчиво уселся в кресла в сторонке и смотрел, как он ест. Прошло полчаса и более. Петр Степанович не торопился, ел со вкусом, звонил, требовал другой горчицы, потом пива, и всё не говорил ни слова. Он был в глубокой задумчивости. Он мог делать два дела – есть со вкусом и быть в глубокой задумчивости. Липутин до того наконец возненавидел его, что не в силах был от него оторваться. Это было нечто вроде нервного припадка. Он считал каждый кусок бифштекса, который тот отправлял в свой рот, ненавидел его за то, как он разевает его, как он жует, как он, смакуя, обсасывает кусок пожирнее, ненавидел самый бифштекс.

He could do two things - eat with taste and be in deep thought. Liputin finally hated him so much that he was unable to tear himself away from him. It was something like a nervous breakdown.

"Произошла одна комбинация, которую господин фон Лембке никак не мог разрешить. В уезде (в том самом, в котором пировал недавно Петр Степанович) один подпоручик подвергся словесному выговору своего ближайшего командира. Случилось это пред всею ротой. Подпоручик был еще молодой человек, недавно из Петербурга, всегда молчаливый и угрюмый, важный с виду, хотя в то же время маленький, толстый и краснощекий. Он не вынес выговора и вдруг бросился на командира с каким-то неожиданным взвизгом, удивившим всю роту, как-то дико наклонив голову; ударил и изо всей силы укусил его в плечо; насилу могли оттащить. Сомнения не было, что сошел с ума, по крайней мере обнаружилось, что в последнее время он замечен был в самых невозможных странностях. Выбросил, например, из квартиры своей два хозяйские образа и один из них изрубил топором; в своей же комнате разложил на подставках, в виде трех налоев, сочинения Фохта, Молешотта и Бюхнера и пред каждым налоем зажигал восковые церковные свечки. По количеству найденных у него книг можно было заключить, что человек он начитанный. Если б у него было пятьдесят тысяч франков, то он уплыл бы, может быть, на Маркизские острова, как тот «кадет», о котором упоминает с таким веселым юмором господин Герцен в одном из своих сочинений. Когда его взяли, то в карманах его и в квартире нашли целую пачку самых отчаянных прокламаций.","There was one combination that Herr von Lembke could not resolve. In the district (in the very one in which Pyotr Stepanovich recently feasted) one second lieutenant was verbally reprimanded by his closest commander. It happened in front of the whole company. The lieutenant was still a young man, recently from Petersburg, always silent and sullen, important in appearance, although at the same time small, fat and red-cheeked. He could not bear the reprimand and suddenly rushed at the commander with some kind of unexpected squeal that surprised the whole company, somehow wildly bowing his head; hit and bit him with all his might on the shoulder; could be dragged away. There was no doubt that he had gone mad, at least it turned out that lately he had been noticed in the most impossible oddities. For example, he threw out two images of his master from his apartment and chopped one of them with an ax; in his own room he laid out on stands, in the form of three layers, the works of Vocht, Moleschott and Buchner, and before each layer he lit wax church candles. By the number of books found with him, it could be concluded that he was a well-read person. If he had fifty thousand francs, he would perhaps have sailed away to the Marquesas Islands, like that ""Cadet"" whom Mr. Herzen mentions with such cheerful humor in one of his writings. When they took him, they found a whole bundle of the most desperate leaflets in his pockets and in the apartment.","A certain combination of circumstances had come to pass which Mr von Lembke was absolutely unable to disentangle. In the district (the same one in which Pyotr Stepanovich had recently been roistering) a certain second lieutenant was subjected to a verbal reprimand by his immediate superior.

The second lieutenant was still a young man, recently from Petersburg, chronically taciturn and morose, with an air of importance, although at the same time small, fat and red-cheeked. He couldn’t endure the reprimand, and suddenly, with an unexpected yelp that startled the entire company, he flung himself on his superior, his head lowered rather like a wild beast ’s. He struck his superior and bit him on the shoulder as hard as he could; he could be pulled off only by force. There was no doubt that he had lost his mind; at least, it came out that he had recently been observed doing the strangest and most outlandish things. For example, he threw two of his landlady’s icons out of his apartment and chopped one of them up with an axe; in his own room he placed the works of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner2 on stands, made to look like three lecterns, and in front of each lectern he lit wax church candles. From the number of books that were found in his quarters it could be concluded that he was a well-read man. If he had had fifty thousand francs, he would perhaps have sailed off to the Marquesas Islands, like the ‘cadet’ who is mentioned with such good humour by Mr Herzen3 in one of his works.

He could not endure the reprimand and suddenly charged at his commander with some sort of unexpected shriek that astonished the whole company, his head somehow savagely lowered; struck him and bit him on the shoulder as hard as he could; they were barely able to pull him away. There was no doubt that he had lost his mind; in any case it was discovered that he had been noted lately for the most impossible oddities. For example, he had thrown two icons belonging to his landlord out of his apartment, and chopped one of them up with an axe; and in his room he had placed the works of Vogt, Moleschott, and Buchner2 on stands like three lecterns, and before each lectern kept wax church candles burning.

"В это утро Петра Степановича многие видели; видевшие упомнили, что он был в чрезвычайно возбужденном состоянии. В два часа пополудни он забегал к Гаганову, всего за день прибывшему из деревни и у которого собрался полон дом посетителей, много и горячо говоривших о только что происшедших событиях. Петр Степанович говорил больше всех и заставил себя слушать. Его всегда считали у нас за «болтливого студента с дырой в голове», но теперь он говорил об Юлии Михайловне, а при всеобщей суматохе тема была захватывающая. Он сообщил о ней, в качестве ее недавнего и интимнейшего конфидента, много весьма новых и неожиданных подробностей; нечаянно (и, конечно, неосторожно) сообщил несколько ее личных отзывов о всем известных в городе лицах, чем тут же кольнул самолюбия. Выходило у него неясно и сбивчиво, как у человека не хитрого, но который поставлен, как честный человек, в мучительную необходимость разъяснить разом целую гору недоумений и который, в простодушной своей неловкости, сам не знает, с чего начать и чем кончить. Довольно тоже неосторожно проскользнуло у него, что Юлии Михайловне была известна вся тайна Ставрогина и что она-то и вела всю интригу. Она-де и его, Петра Степановича, подвела, потому что он сам был влюблен в эту несчастную Лизу, а между тем его так «подвернули», что он же почти проводил ее в карете к Ставрогину. «Да, да, хорошо вам, господа, смеяться, а если б я только знал, если б знал, чем это кончится!» – заключил он. На разные тревожные вопросы о Ставрогине он прямо заявил, что катастрофа с Лебядкиным, по его мнению, чистый случай и виновен во всем сам Лебядкин, показывавший деньги. Он это особенно хорошо разъяснил. Один из слушателей как-то заметил ему, что он напрасно «представляется»; что он ел, пил, чуть не спал в доме Юлии Михайловны, а теперь первый же ее и чернит, и что это вовсе не так красиво, как он полагает. Но Петр Степанович тотчас же защитил себя: «Я ел и пил не потому, что у меня не было денег, и не виноват, что меня туда приглашали. Позвольте мне самому судить, насколько мне быть за то благодарным».","Many people saw Pyotr Stepanovitch that morning; those who saw him remembered that he was in an extremely agitated state. At two o'clock in the afternoon he ran to Gaganov, who had arrived from the village just a day before, and whose house was full of visitors, who spoke a lot and heatedly about the events that had just taken place. Pyotr Stepanovich spoke more than anyone else and forced himself to listen. We always considered him to be a “talkative student with a hole in his head,” but now he was talking about Yulia Mikhailovna, and in the general turmoil the topic was exciting. He told about her, as her recent and most intimate confidant, many very new and unexpected details; accidentally (and, of course, inadvertently) told her some of her personal reviews about all the well-known people in the city, which immediately pricked her pride. It came out vaguely and inconsistently, like a man who is not cunning, but who, like an honest man, is placed in the tormenting need to explain at once a whole mountain of perplexities and who, in his ingenuous awkwardness, does not know himself where to start and how to end. It slipped through him quite carelessly, too, that Yulia Mihailovna knew the whole secret of Stavrogin, and that it was she who led the whole intrigue. She supposedly let him down, too, Pyotr Stepanovich, because he himself was in love with that unfortunate Lisa, and meanwhile he was so “turned up” that he almost saw her off in a carriage to Stavrogin. “Yes, yes, it’s good for you, gentlemen, to laugh, but if I only knew, if I knew how it would end!” he concluded. In response to various anxious questions about Stavrogin, he openly stated that the catastrophe with Lebyadkin, in his opinion, was a pure accident and Lebyadkin himself, who showed the money, was to blame for everything. He explained it very well. One of the listeners once remarked to him that he ""introduced himself"" in vain; that he ate, drank, almost slept in Yulia Mikhailovna's house, and now the first one is blackening her, and that this is not at all as beautiful as he believes. But Pyotr Stepanovich immediately defended himself: “I ate and drank not because I had no money, and it’s not my fault that I was invited there. Let me judge for myself how grateful I am for that.”","That morning Pyotr Stepanovich was seen by many people. Those who saw him remembered that he was in an extremely excited state. At two o’clock in the afternoon he ran off to visit Gaganov, who had arrived from the country just the day before, and whose house was full of visitors, who were talking heatedly and at length about the events that had just occurred. Pyotr Stepanovich talked more than anyone else, and made himself heard. He had always been considered locally as a ‘garrulous student with a hole in his head’, but now he was talking about Yuliya Mikhaylovna, and given the general commotion, the topic was gripping. In his capacity as her recent and highly intimate confidant, he revealed many completely new and unexpected details about her. Inadvertently (and of course indiscreetly) he revealed some of her personal remarks about people known to everyone in town, thereby wounding their vanity. He related all this in a vague and inconsistent way, like a man who wasn’t clever, but who had been faced, as an honest man, with the painful necessity of explaining a whole mass of misunderstandings all at once; one who, in his naive awkwardness, didn’t himself know where to begin and where to stop. He also let it slip rather indiscreetly that Stavrogin’s entire secret was known to Yuliya Mikhaylovna, and that she was the one who had masterminded the whole intrigue. And she supposedly had deceived him, Pyotr Stepanovich, because he himself was in love with the hapless Liza, and meanwhile he’d been ‘twisted round’ to the point where he’d almost escorted her to Stavrogin’s carriage. ‘Yes, yes, it’s all very well for you to laugh, ladies and gentlemen, but if I had only known, if I had only known how this would end!’ he concluded. To various alarmed questions about Stavrogin he stated straight out that the disaster that had befallen Lebyadkin in his opinion was purely accidental, and that Lebyadkin himself was to blame for everything, since he had shown people his money. He explained that especially well. One of his listeners happened to observe that it did him no good to ‘present himself’ this way: he had eaten, drunk, almost slept in Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s house, and now he was the first to blacken her name, and that was not as pretty a thing as he supposed it to be. But Pyotr Stepanovich immediately sprang to his own defence: ‘I ate and drank there not because I had no money, and I’m not to blame that I kept being invited there. Permit me to judge for myself how grateful I am to be for that.’","Many saw Pyotr Stepanovich that morning; those who did recall that he was extremely excited.

He let slip, also rather imprudently, that Yulia Mikhailovna knew the whole of Stavrogin's secret and that she herself had conducted the whole intrigue. And she had also done him, Pyotr Stepanovich, a bad turn, because he himself had been in love with this unfortunate Liza, and yet he had been so ""turned around"" that he had almost taken her to Stavrogin in a carriage.

To various anxious inquiries about Stavrogin, he declared directly that the catastrophe with Lebyadkin was, in his opinion, pure chance, and the one to blame for it all was Lebyadkin himself who displayed his money. He explained this particularly well. One of the listeners at some point observed to him that he had no business ""playacting""; that he ate, drank, and all but slept in Yulia Mikhailovna's house, and was now the first to besmirch her, and that it was not at all as pretty a thing as he supposed.

"– И это даже будет очень хорошо-с в некотором смысле, – совершенно оживился Петр Степанович. – Извините, я давеча не докончил. Я именно о покровительстве. Можете представить, что когда уехал тогда Николай Всеволодович (я начинаю с того именно места, где остановился, Варвара Петровна), этот господин, вот этот самый господин Лебядкин мигом вообразил себя вправе распорядиться пенсионом, назначенным его сестрице, без остатка; и распорядился. Я не знаю в точности, как это было тогда устроено Николаем Всеволодовичем, но через год, уж из-за границы, он, узнав о происходившем, принужден был распорядиться иначе. Опять не знаю подробностей, он их сам расскажет, но знаю только, что интересную особу поместили где-то в отдаленном монастыре, весьма даже комфортно, но под дружеским присмотром – понимаете? На что же, вы думаете, решается господин Лебядкин? Он употребляет сперва все усилия, чтобы разыскать, где скрывают от него оброчную статью, то есть сестрицу, недавно только достигает цели, берет ее из монастыря, предъявив какое-то на нее право, и привозит ее прямо сюда. Здесь он ее не кормит, бьет, тиранит, наконец получает каким-то путем от Николая Всеволодовича значительную сумму, тотчас же пускается пьянствовать, а вместо благодарности кончает дерзким вызовом Николаю Всеволодовичу, бессмысленными требованиями, угрожая, в случае неплатежа пенсиона впредь ему прямо в руки, судом. Таким образом, добровольный дар Николая Всеволодовича он принимает за дань, – можете себе представить?

You can imagine that when Nikolai Vsevolodovich left then (I start from the very place where I stopped, Varvara Petrovna), this gentleman, this same Mr. Lebyadkin instantly imagined himself entitled to dispose of the pension assigned to his sister, without a trace; and ordered. I don’t know exactly how Nikolai Vsevolodovich arranged it then, but a year later, from abroad, he, having learned about what was happening, was forced to order differently. Again, I don’t know the details, he will tell them himself, but I only know that an interesting person was placed somewhere in a remote monastery, quite comfortably, but under friendly supervision - you understand? What do you think Mr. Lebyadkin decides to do? At first, he makes every effort to find out where the obligatory article, that is, his sister, is hidden from him, only recently he reaches the goal, takes her from the monastery, claiming some kind of right to her, and brings her right here. Here he does not feed her, beats, tyrannizes, finally receives in some way from Nikolai Vsevolodovich a significant amount, immediately starts to drink, and instead of gratitude ends up with a daring challenge to Nikolai Vsevolodovich, senseless demands, threatening, in case of non-payment of the pension, from now on directly into his hands , court. Thus, he takes the voluntary gift of Nikolai Vsevolodovich for a tribute - can you imagine? Mr. Lebyadkin, is everything that I just said here true?","‘And that will even be very good indeed, in a certain sense,’ said Pyotr Stepanovich, now fully alert. ‘ Pardon me, I did not finish what I had to say a moment ago. It’s precisely about patronage. Can you imagine that when Nikolay Vsevolodovich departed just then (I am beginning precisely from the place where I left off, Varvara Petrovna), that gentleman, that very gentleman standing there, Mr Lebyadkin, instantly imagined that he had the right to do what he wanted with the allowance that had been provided for his sister, without anything left over; and so he did. I don’t have exact knowledge of how it was set up by Nikolay Vsevolodovich, but within a year, while he was still abroad, he learned of what was happening and was compelled to make other arrangements. Again I don’t know the details, he’ll tell you himself; I know only that the interesting individual in question was placed somewhere in a remote convent, all very comfortably, but under friendly supervision — do you understand? What do you think Mr Lebyadkin made up his mind to do? First, he bent all his efforts to snoop out where his annuity, that is, his sister, was being hidden from him, and he achieved his goal not long ago; he removed her from the convent, after laying some claim to her, and brought her straight here. Now he doesn’t feed her; he beats her, he tyrannizes her and, when he finally receives by some means a considerable sum of money from Nikolay Vsevolodovich, he proceeds to get drunk, and instead of gratitude he ends by issuing an impertinent challenge to Nikolay Vsevolodovich, making senseless demands, and threatening, in the event that the pension is not paid directly to him in advance, to take him to court. And so, he takes Nikolay Vsevolodovich’s voluntary gift as something that ’s owed him. Can you imagine that? Mr Lebyadkin, is everything that I’ve just been saying here true?’","""And that will even be very good, madam, in a certain sense,"" Pyotr Stepanovich became thoroughly animated. "" Excuse me, I didn't finish just now. Precisely to do with patronage. Can you imagine, when Nikolai Vsevolodovich left then (I'm starting precisely from where I left off, Varvara Petrovna), this gentleman, this same Mr. Lebyadkin, at once fancied he had the right to dispose of the pension that had been allotted to his sister, the whole of it; and so he did. I don't know exactly how it was all arranged by Nikolai Vsevolodovich, but a year later, from abroad now, having found out what was going on, he was forced to make different arrangements. Again, I don't know the details, he will tell you himself, all I know is that the interesting person was placed somewhere in a remote convent, quite comfortably, even, but under friendly supervision-you understand? And what do you think Mr. Lebyadkin decides to do? First, he makes every effort to find out where the quitrent item-that is, his dear sister-has been hidden from him, achieves his goal just recently, takes her from the convent, having presented some sort of rights over her, and brings her straight to this town. Here he doesn't feed her, he beats her, tyrannizes over her, and finally in some way obtains a significant sum from Nikolai Vsevolodovich, immediately starts drinking, and instead of gratitude ends with brazen defiance of Nikolai Vsevolodovich, senseless demands, threatening to go to court in case of the nonpayment of the pension directly into his hands. So he takes Nikolai Vsevolodovich's voluntary gift as his due-can you imagine that? Mr. Lebyadkin, is everything I've said here just now true?"""
"Тогда было время особенное; наступило что-то новое, очень уж непохожее на прежнюю тишину, и что-то очень уж странное, но везде ощущаемое, даже в Скворешниках. Доходили разные слухи. Факты были вообще известны более или менее, но очевидно было, что кроме фактов явились и какие-то сопровождавшие их идеи, и, главное, в чрезмерном количестве. А это-то и смущало: никак невозможно было примениться и в точности узнать, что именно означали эти идеи? Варвара Петровна, вследствие женского устройства натуры своей, непременно хотела подразумевать в них секрет. Она принялась было сама читать газеты и журналы, заграничные запрещенные издания и даже начавшиеся тогда прокламации (всё это ей доставлялось); но у ней только голова закружилась. Принялась она писать письма: отвечали ей мало, и чем далее, тем непонятнее. Степан Трофимович торжественно приглашен был объяснить ей «все эти идеи» раз навсегда; но объяснениями его она осталась положительно недовольна. Взгляд Степана Трофимовича на всеобщее движение был в высшей степени высокомерный; у него всё сводилось на то, что он сам забыт и никому не нужен. Наконец и о нем вспомянули, сначала в заграничных изданиях, как о ссыльном страдальце, и потом тотчас же в Петербурге, как о бывшей звезде в известном созвездии; даже сравнивали его почему-то с Радищевым. Затем кто-то напечатал, что он уже умер, и обещал его некролог. Степан Трофимович мигом воскрес и сильно приосанился. Всё высокомерие его взгляда на современников разом соскочило, и в нем загорелась мечта: примкнуть к движению и показать свои силы. Варвара Петровна тотчас же вновь и во всё уверовала и ужасно засуетилась. Решено было ехать в Петербург без малейшего отлагательства, разузнать всё на деле, вникнуть лично и, если возможно, войти в новую деятельность всецело и нераздельно. Между прочим, она объявила, что готова основать свой журнал и посвятить ему отныне всю свою жизнь. Увидав, что дошло даже до этого, Степан Трофимович стал еще высокомернее, в дороге же начал относиться к Варваре Петровне почти покровительственно, что она тотчас же сложила в сердце своем. Впрочем, у ней была и другая весьма важная причина к поездке, именно возобновление высших связей. Надо было по возможности напомнить о себе в свете, по крайней мере попытаться. Гласным же предлогом к путешествию было свидание с единственным сыном, оканчивавшим тогда курс наук в петербургском лицее.","It was a special time then; something new has come, very different from the former silence, and something very strange, but felt everywhere, even in Skvoreshniki. There were various rumors. The facts were generally more or less known, but it was obvious that, in addition to the facts, some accompanying ideas also appeared, and, most importantly, in excessive numbers. And this was what was embarrassing: it was impossible to apply and find out exactly what these ideas meant? Varvara Petrovna, owing to the womanly nature of her nature, certainly wanted to imply a secret in them. She began to read newspapers and magazines herself, forbidden publications abroad, and even proclamations that had begun at that time (all this was delivered to her); but she just got dizzy. She began to write letters: they answered her little, and the further, the more incomprehensible. Stepan Trofimovich was solemnly invited to explain ""all these ideas"" to her once and for all; but she remained positively dissatisfied with his explanations. Stepan Trofimovich's view of the general movement was extremely arrogant; it all boiled down to the fact that he himself was forgotten and no one needed him. Finally, they also remembered him, first in foreign publications, as an exiled sufferer, and then immediately in St. Petersburg, as a former star in a certain constellation; for some reason they even compared him with Radishchev. Then someone printed that he had already died and promised his obituary. Stepan Trofimovich was instantly resurrected and drew himself up strongly. All the arrogance of his glance at his contemporaries jumped off at once, and a dream flared up in him: to join the movement and show his strength. Varvara Petrovna at once again believed in everything and began to fuss terribly. It was decided to go to Petersburg without the slightest delay, to find out everything in practice, to penetrate personally and, if possible, enter into the new activity wholly and indivisibly. By the way, she announced that she was ready to found her own magazine and from now on devote her whole life to it. Seeing that it had even come to this, Stepan Trofimovich became even more arrogant, and on the way he began to treat Varvara Petrovna almost patronizingly, which she immediately formed in her heart. However, she had another very important reason for the trip, namely the renewal of higher connections. It was necessary, if possible, to remind oneself in the world, at least to try. The main pretext for the trip was a meeting with his only son, who was then completing a course of science at the St. Petersburg Lyceum.","That was a special time: something new was afoot, something very unlike the tranquillity of the past, and something very strange too, but which could be felt everywhere, even in Skvoreshniki. Various rumours began to reach us. The facts were generally known, more or less, but it was obvious that apart from the facts there were certain ideas accompanying them, and, most importantly, a great number of them. But this is what was truly confusing: it proved utterly impossible to adapt to these ideas and find out exactly what they meant. Varvara Petrovna, owing to her female nature, was bound and determined to get to the bottom of whatever secrets they contained. She undertook to read for herself the newspapers and journals, forbidden foreign publications and even the manifestos that were beginning to appear at that time (she got her hands on all these things); but they did nothing but make her head spin. She set about writing letters: she received few replies, and the longer she persisted, the more incomprehensible the ideas became. Stepan Trofimovich was solemnly invited to explain ‘all these ideas’ to her once and for all; but she remained completely dissatisfied with his explanations. Stepan Trofimovich’s view of the direction in which things were generally moving was highly condescending; to his mind, it all came down to the fact that he himself had been forgotten and was of no use to anyone. At last mention was made of him too: at first in foreign publications, as an exiled martyr, and immediately thereafter in Petersburg, as a former star in a famous constellation; he was even compared with Radishchev27 for some reason. Then someone stated in print that he was already dead, and promised an obituary of him. In an instant, Stepan Trofimovich came back to life and assumed the air of a person of consequence. His condescending attitude towards his contemporaries immediately vanished for good and all, and a dream began to glow in his heart: of joining the new movement and demonstrating his powers. Varvara Petrovna at once regained her faith in everything, and began bustling about furiously. It was decided to go to Petersburg without a moment’s delay, to find out how matters there actually stood, to look into everything personally, and, if possible, to plunge into all this new activity wholeheartedly and unreservedly. She announced, by the way, that she was prepared to establish her own magazine and devote her entire life to it from then on. Seeing that things had gone so far, Stepan Trofimovich became still more condescending, and on the journey he began to treat Varvara Petrovna almost patronizingly, something she immediately laid up in her heart. However, she had yet another important reason for making the trip, namely, the renewal of her high connections. It was necessary, as far as possible, to remind society of her existence, or at least to make the attempt. But the ostensible reason for the journey was a meeting with her only son, who just then was completing a course of studies at a Petersburg lyceum.28","It was a peculiar time; something new was beginning, quite unlike the former tranquillity, something quite strange, but felt everywhere, even in Skvoreshniki. Various rumors arrived. The facts were generally more or less known, but it was obvious that, besides the facts, certain accompanying ideas also appeared, and, what's more, in exceeding numbers. That was what was bewildering: there was no way to adapt and find out just exactly what these ideas meant. Varvara Petrovna, owing to the feminine makeup of her character, certainly wanted to suppose some secret in them. She herself began reading newspapers and magazines, prohibited foreign publications, and even the tracts that were beginning then (she had it all sent to her); but it only made her head spin. She started writing letters: the replies were few, and the longer it went on, the more incomprehensible they became. Stepan Trofimovich was solemnly invited to explain ""all these ideas"" to her once and for all; but she remained positively displeased with his explanations. Stepan Trofimovich's view of the general movement was scornful in the highest degree; with him it all came down to his being forgotten and not needed by anyone. Finally he, too, was remembered, first in foreign publications, as an exiled martyr, and immediately after that in Petersburg, as a former star in a noted constellation; he was even compared for some reason with Radishchev.14 Then someone printed that he had died, and promised an obituary. Stepan Trofimovich instantly resurrected and reassumed his majesty. All the scornfulness of his views of his contemporaries dropped away at once, and a dream began burning in him: to join the movement and show his powers. Varvara Petrovna instantly believed again and in everything, and started bustling about terribly. It was decided that they should go to Petersburg without the least delay, to find out everything in reality, to go into it all personally, and, if possible, to involve themselves wholly and undividedly in the new activity. Among other things, she announced that she was prepared to found her own magazine and dedicate her whole life to it from then on. Seeing it had even come to that, Stepan Trofimovich became more scornful than ever, and during the trip began treating Varvara Petrovna almost patronizingly, which she immediately laid up in her heart.

She needed as far as possible to remind the world of herself, or at least to make the attempt.

"А тут как нарочно снова просунул к нему голову Блюм. Всё время посещения Петра Степановича он выжидал недалеко. Блюм этот приходился даже родственником Андрею Антоновичу, дальним, но всю жизнь тщательно и боязливо скрываемым. Прошу прощения у читателя в том, что этому ничтожному лицу отделю здесь хоть несколько слов. Блюм был из странного рода «несчастных» немцев – и вовсе не по крайней своей бездарности, а именно неизвестно почему. «Несчастные» немцы не миф, а действительно существуют, даже в России, и имеют свой собственный тип. Андрей Антонович всю жизнь питал к нему самое трогательное сочувствие и везде, где только мог, по мере собственных своих успехов по службе, выдвигал его на подчиненное, подведомственное ему местечко; но тому нигде не везло. То место оставлялось за штатом, то переменялось начальство, то чуть не упекли его однажды с другими под суд. Был он аккуратен, но как-то слишком, без нужды и во вред себе, мрачен; рыжий, высокий, сгорбленный, унылый, даже чувствительный и, при всей своей приниженности, упрямый и настойчивый, как вол, хотя всегда невпопад. К Андрею Антоновичу питал он с женой и с многочисленными детьми многолетнюю и благоговейную привязанность. Кроме Андрея Антоновича, никто никогда не любил его. Юлия Михайловна сразу его забраковала, но одолеть упорство своего супруга не могла. Это была их первая супружеская ссора, и случилась она тотчас после свадьбы, в самые первые медовые дни, когда вдруг обнаружился пред нею Блюм, до тех пор тщательно от нее припрятанный, с обидною тайной своего к ней родства. Андрей Антонович умолял сложа руки, чувствительно рассказал всю историю Блюма и их дружбы с самого детства, но Юлия Михайловна считала себя опозоренною навеки и даже пустила в ход обмороки. Фон Лембке не уступил ей ни шагу и объявил, что не покинет Блюма ни за что на свете и не отдалит от себя, так что она наконец удивилась и принуждена была позволить Блюма. Решено было только, что родство будет скрываемо еще тщательнее, чем до сих пор, если только это возможно, и что даже имя и отчество Блюма будут изменены, потому что его тоже почему-то звали Андреем Антоновичем. Блюм у нас ни с кем не познакомился, кроме одного только немца-аптекаря, никому не сделал визитов и, по обычаю своему, зажил скупо и уединенно. Ему давно уже были известны и литературные грешки Андрея Антоновича. Он преимущественно призывался выслушивать его роман в секретных чтениях наедине, просиживал по шести часов сряду столбом; потел, напрягал все свои силы, чтобы не заснуть и улыбаться; придя домой, стенал вместе с длинноногою и сухопарою женой о несчастной слабости их благодетеля к русской литературе.","And then, as if on purpose, Bloom again thrust his head towards him. All the time he visited Pyotr Stepanovich, he waited not far away. This Blum was even a relative of Andrey Antonovich, distant, but all his life carefully and timidly concealed. I beg your pardon from the reader that I will separate at least a few words here for this insignificant person. Blum was from a strange family of ""unfortunate"" Germans - and not at all because of his extreme mediocrity, but for some unknown reason. The ""unfortunate"" Germans are not a myth, but really exist, even in Russia, and have their own type. Andrei Antonovich had the most touching sympathy for him all his life, and wherever he could, to the extent of his own successes in his service, he promoted him to a subordinate, subordinate to him place; but that didn't work anywhere. That place was left for the state, then the authorities changed, then they almost got him one day with others on trial. He was neat, but somehow too, needlessly and to his own detriment, gloomy; red, tall, hunched, dull, even sensitive and, for all his humiliation, stubborn and persistent, like an ox, although always out of place. To Andrey Antonovich, he had a long-term and reverent affection with his wife and numerous children. Except Andrei Antonovich, no one has ever loved him. Yulia Mikhailovna immediately rejected him, but she could not overcome the stubbornness of her husband. This was their first marital quarrel, and it happened immediately after the wedding, on the very first honeymoon days, when Blum suddenly appeared before her, carefully hidden from her until then, with the offensive secret of his relationship to her. Andrei Antonovich begged with folded hands, sensitively told the whole story of Blum and their friendship from childhood, but Yulia Mikhailovna considered herself disgraced forever and even started fainting. Von Lembke did not yield a single step to her and announced that he would not leave Blum for anything in the world and would not alienate himself, so that she was finally surprised and was forced to allow Blum. It was only decided that the relationship would be hidden even more carefully than hitherto, if possible, and that even Blum's name and patronymic would be changed, because for some reason his name was also Andrei Antonovich. Blum made no acquaintances with us, except for one German pharmacist, made no visits to anyone, and, according to his custom, lived sparingly and in solitude. He had long been aware of Andrey Antonovich's literary sins. He was mainly called upon to listen to his novel in secret readings in private, sitting for six hours in a row like a post; sweated, exerted all his strength to stay awake and smile; having come home, he lamented with his long-legged and lean wife about the unfortunate weakness of their benefactor in Russian literature.","At this point, as luck would have it, Blum again stuck his head into the study. Throughout Pyotr Stepanovich’s visit he had been waiting nearby. This Blum was actually a relative of Andrey Antonovich, but a distant one, a fact he had carefully and timidly concealed his entire life. I beg the reader’s pardon for devoting just a few words here to this insignificant figure. Blum belonged to the strange genus of ‘unfortunate’ Germans — unfortunate certainly not for their utter lack of ability, but for reasons unknown. ‘Unfortunate’ Germans are not a myth; they actually exist, even in Russia, and form a type of their own. All his life Andrey Antonovich had nursed a deeply touching sympathy for him, and wherever he could, as he himself advanced in government service, would promote him to some small position that was subordinate to and dependent on him, but Blum had no luck anywhere. Sometimes the position was abolished, sometimes a new superior took over and once he was almost dragged into court along with some others. He was thorough, but somehow too much so, and to his detriment needlessly morose; tall, with red hair, stooped, despondent, even sensitive, and for all his submissiveness, stubborn and persistent as an ox, although always at the wrong time. Towards Andrey Antonovich he and his wife and their numerous children had nursed a reverential devotion of many years’ standing. Except for Andrey Antonovich, no one had ever liked him. Yuliya Mikhaylovna immediately rejected him, but was unable to overcome her spouse’s stubbornness. This was their first quarrel as a married couple, and it occurred immediately after the wedding, during the very first days of the honeymoon, when Blum, who until then had painstakingly been hidden away from her, along with the insulting secret that he was related to her, suddenly stood revealed before her. Andrey Antonovich begged her with clasped hands, and related to her with great emotion the whole story of Blum and of their friendship since earliest childhood, but Yuliya Mikhaylovna considered that she had been disgraced forever, and even resorted to a fainting fit. Von Lembke wouldn’t yield an inch to her, and announced that he would not abandon Blum for anything in the world and would not remove him from his presence, so that finally, to her surprise, she was forced to permit Blum to stay. The only thing decided was that the relationship would be concealed even more scrupulously than before, if that were at all possible, and that Blum’s first name and patronymic would even be changed, because for some reason he too was called Andrey Antonovich. Blum didn’t get to know anyone in our town except for the German pharmacist, never paid visits to anyone and began to live, as he always had, a miserly and isolated life. He had long been aware of the literary peccadilloes of Andrey Antonovich. He was summoned primarily to listen to his novel in secret readings one on one, and would remain sitting for six hours on end like a post. He would perspire and summon up all his strength to avoid falling asleep or smiling. On arriving home, he would groan, along with his long-legged, skinny wife, over their benefactor’s unfortunate weakness for Russian literature.","And here, as if by design, Blum again stuck his head into the room. Throughout Pyotr Stepanovich's visit, he had bided his time not far away. This Blum was even a relation of Andrei Antonovich's, but a distant one, carefully and timorously concealed all his life. I ask the reader's pardon for granting at least a few words here to this insignificant person. Blum belonged to the strange breed of ""unfortunate"" Germans-not at all owing to his extreme giftlessness, but precisely for no known reason. "" Unfortunate"" Germans are not a myth, they really exist, even in Russia, and have their own type. All his life Andrei Antonovich had nursed a most touching sympathy for him, and wherever he could, as he himself succeeded in the service, kept promoting him to subordinate positions within his jurisdiction, but the man had no luck anywhere. Either the position would be abolished, or the superior would be replaced, or else he was once almost put on trial along with some others. He was precise, but somehow excessively, needlessly, and to his own detriment, gloomy; red-haired, tall, stooping, doleful, even sentimental, yet, for all his downtroddenness, stubborn and persistent as an ox, though always at the wrong time. He and his wife, with their numerous children, nursed a long-standing and reverential affection for Andrei Antonovich. Except for Andrei Antonovich, no one had ever loved him. Yulia Mikhailovna discarded him at once, but proved unable to overcome her husband's tenacity. This was their first family quarrel, and it took place just after their wedding, in the very first honey days, when Blum suddenly came to light, after having been carefully hidden from her, along with the offensive secret of his being her relation. Andrei Antonovich entreated her with clasped hands, recounted feelingly the whole story of Blum and of their friendship from very childhood, but Yulia Mikhailovna considered herself disgraced forever and even resorted to swooning. Von Lembke did not yield an inch to her and declared that he would not abandon Blum for anything in the world, nor distance him from himself, so that she was finally surprised and was forced to permit Blum. Only it was decided that their relation must be concealed still more carefully than before, if that were possible, and that Blum's name and patronymic would be changed, because for some reason he, too, was named Andrei Antonovich. Among us Blum made no acquaintances, except with the German pharmacist, paid no calls, and, as was his wont, lived his niggardly and solitary life. He had long known, too, about Andrei Antonovich's literary peccadilloes. He was mainly summoned to listen to his novels in secret, intimate readings, would sit it out like a post for six hours on end; sweated, exerted all his strength to smile and not fall asleep; on coming home would lament, together with his long-legged and lean-fleshed wife, over their benefactor's unfortunate weakness for Russian literature."

"Скоро он забылся совсем. Варвара Петровна, измучившая себя в эти дни заботами, не вытерпела и по уходе Петра Степановича, обещавшего к ней зайти и не сдержавшего обещания, рискнула сама навестить Nicolas, несмотря на неуказанное время. Ей всё мерещилось: не скажет ли он наконец чего-нибудь окончательно? Тихо, как и давеча, постучалась она в дверь и, опять не получая ответа, отворила сама. Увидав, что Nicolas сидит что-то слишком уж неподвижно, она с бьющимся сердцем осторожно приблизилась сама к дивану. Ее как бы поразило, что он так скоро заснул и что может так спать, так прямо сидя и так неподвижно; даже дыхания почти нельзя было заметить. Лицо было бледное и суровое, но совсем как бы застывшее, недвижимое; брови немного сдвинуты и нахмурены; решительно, он походил на бездушную восковую фигуру. Она простояла над ним минуты три, едва переводя дыхание, и вдруг ее обнял страх; она вышла на цыпочках, приостановилась в дверях, наскоро перекрестила его и удалилась незамеченная, с новым тяжелым ощущением и с новою тоской.","Soon he completely forgot.

Seeing that Nicolas was sitting somewhat too still, she carefully approached the sofa herself with a beating heart. She seemed to be amazed that he fell asleep so soon and that he could sleep like that, sitting up straight and so motionless; even breathing was almost unnoticeable. The face was pale and stern, but quite as if frozen, motionless; eyebrows slightly shifted and frowned; decidedly, he looked like a soulless wax figure. She stood over him for about three minutes, barely catching her breath, and suddenly fear seized her; she went out on tiptoe, paused in the doorway, hastily crossed him, and went away unnoticed, with a new heavy feeling and a new anguish.","Soon he drifted off completely.

She kept imagining that he would finally say something definite to her once and for all. Quietly, as she had done not so long before, she knocked on the door, and again receiving no answer, opened it herself. Seeing that Nicolas was sitting without moving a muscle, she approached the sofa cautiously and with pounding heart. She seemed astonished that he had fallen asleep so quickly and that he could sleep in this position, sitting up so straight and motionless; even his breathing was barely perceptible. His face was pale and stern, but looked utterly frozen and immovable; his eyebrows were drawn together a little and frowning; he certainly looked like a lifeless wax figure. She stood over him for a good three minutes, scarcely breathing, and was suddenly gripped by fear. She went out on tiptoe, paused in the doorway, quickly made the sign of the cross over him and withdrew unobserved, with a new heavy feeling and a new anguish.","Soon he became totally oblivious.

Stavrogin hit him on the arm with a strong movement.","‘Their throats have been cut, but they haven’t been burnt, and that’s too bad, but I give you my word of honour that I’m not to blame there, no matter how much you might suspect me — because you do perhaps suspect me, eh? If you want the whole truth, the thought really did cross my mind , you see — you were the one who suggested it to me, not seriously, but teasingly (because you wouldn’t really suggest such a thing seriously); but I couldn’t make up my mind to do it, and I wouldn’t make up my mind to do it for anything in the world, not for a hundred roubles — why, there are no advantages to it, that is, for me, for me…’ (He was in a dreadful hurry and was chattering away.) ‘But just look at the coincidence of circumstances: out of my own money (you hear, out of my own, there wasn’t one rouble of yours, and the main thing is that you yourself know it), I gave that drunken idiot Lebyadkin two hundred and thirty roubles the day before yesterday, in the evening. You hear, the day before yesterday, and not yesterday after the “reading”, take note of that: that’s a very importance coincidence, because I didn’t know anything for certain at the time, you see, whether Lizaveta Nikolayevna would come to you or not. And I gave my own money solely because the day before yesterday you distinguished yourself by taking it into your head to announce your secret to everyone. Well, I’m not going into … it’s your business… you gallant knight… but I admit I was as surprised as if I’d been hit on the head with a cudgel. But since these tragedies have bored me exceeding much — and note that I’m speaking seriously, even though I’m using an archaic expression — since all this ultimately works against my plans, then I promised myself to send the Lebyadkins off to Petersburg at all cost and without your knowledge, the more so since he himself was itching to go there. One mistake: I gave him the money in your name. Was that a mistake or not? Maybe it wasn’t a mistake, eh? Now listen to me, listen to how all this turned out.’ In the heat of all this talk he had walked right up to Stavrogin and was about to grab him by the lapel of his frock-coat (I swear, perhaps deliberately). Stavrogin struck him on the arm with a vigorous gesture.","""Killed but not burned, and that's the bad thing, but I give you my word of honor that I'm not guilty there either, however much you suspect me-because maybe you do suspect me, eh?

Больной с высокомерною улыбкой указал на свой маленький сак; в нем Софья Матвеевна отыскала его указ об отставке или что-то в этом роде, по которому он всю жизнь проживал.

"Вся эта ночь с своими почти нелепыми событиями и с страшною «развязкой» наутро мерещится мне до сих пор как безобразный, кошмарный сон и составляет – для меня по крайней мере – самую тяжелую часть моей хроники. Я хотя и опоздал на бал, но все-таки приехал к его концу, – так быстро суждено было ему окончиться. Был уже одиннадцатый час, когда я достиг подъезда дома предводительши, где та же давешняя Белая зала, в которой происходило чтение, уже была, несмотря на малый срок, прибрана и приготовлена служить главною танцевальною залой, как предполагалось, для всего города. Но как ни был я худо настроен в пользу бала еще давеча утром, – всё же я не предчувствовал полной истины: ни единого семейства из высшего круга не явилось; даже чиновники чуть-чуть позначительнее манкировали, – а уж это была чрезвычайно сильная черта. Что до дам и девиц, то давешние расчеты Петра Степановича (теперь уже очевидно коварные) оказались в высшей степени неправильными: съехалось чрезвычайно мало; на четырех мужчин вряд ли приходилась одна дама, да и какие дамы! «Какие-то» жены полковых обер-офицеров, разная почтамтская и чиновничья мелюзга, три лекарши с дочерьми, две-три помещицы из бедненьких, семь дочерей и одна племянница того секретаря, о котором я как-то упоминал выше, купчихи, – того ли ожидала Юлия Михайловна? Даже купцы наполовину не съехались. Что до мужчин, то, несмотря на компактное отсутствие всей нашей знати, масса их все-таки была густа, но производила двусмысленное и подозрительное впечатление. Конечно, тут было несколько весьма тихих и почтительных офицеров со своими женами, несколько самых послушных отцов семейств, как всё тот же, например, секретарь, отец своих семи дочерей. Весь этот смирный мелкотравчатый люд явился, так сказать, «по неизбежности», как выразился один из этих господ. Но, с другой стороны, масса бойких особ и, кроме того, масса таких лиц, которых я и Петр Степанович заподозрили давеча как впущенных без билетов, казалось, еще увеличилась против давешнего. Все они пока сидели в буфете и, являясь, так и проходили прямо в буфет, как в заранее условленное место. Так по крайней мере мне показалось. Буфет помещался в конце анфилады комнат, в просторной зале, где водворился Прохорыч со всеми обольщениями клубной кухни и с заманчивою выставкой закусок и выпивок. Я заметил тут несколько личностей чуть не в прорванных сюртуках, в самых сомнительных, слишком не в бальных костюмах, очевидно вытрезвленных с непомерным трудом и на малое время, и бог знает откуда взятых, каких-то иногородних. Мне, конечно, было известно, что по идее Юлии Михайловны предположено было устроить бал самый демократический, «не отказывая даже и мещанам, если бы случилось, что кто-нибудь из таковых внесет за билет». Эти слова она смело могла выговорить в своем комитете, в полной уверенности, что никому из мещан нашего города, сплошь нищих, не придет в голову взять билет. Но все-таки я усумнился, чтоб этих мрачных и почти оборванных сертучников можно было впустить, несмотря на весь демократизм комитета. Но кто же их впустил и с какою целью? Липутин и Лямшин были уже лишены своих распорядительских бантов (хотя и присутствовали на бале, участвуя в «кадрили литературы»); но место Липутина занял, к удивлению моему, тот давешний семинарист, который всего более оскандалил «утро» схваткой со Степаном Трофимовичем, а место Лямшина – сам Петр Степанович; чего же можно было ожидать в таком случае? Я старался прислушаться к разговорам. Иные мнения поражали своею дикостью. Утверждали, например, в одной кучке, что всю историю Ставрогина с Лизой обделала Юлия Михайловна и за это взяла со Ставрогина деньги. Называли даже сумму. Утверждали, что даже и праздник устроила она с этою целью; потому-то-де половина города и не явилась, узнав, в чем дело, а сам Лембке был так фраппирован, что «расстроился в рассудке», и она теперь его «водит» помешанного. Тут много было и хохоту, сиплого, дикого и себе на уме. Все страшно тоже критиковали бал, а Юлию Михайловну ругали безо всякой церемонии. Вообще болтовня была беспорядочная, отрывистая, хмельная и беспокойная, так что трудно было сообразиться и что-нибудь вывести. Тут же в буфете приютился и просто веселый люд, даже было несколько дам из таких, которых уже ничем не удивишь и не испугаешь, прелюбезных и развеселых, большею частию всё офицерских жен, с своими мужьями. Они устроились на отдельных столиках компаниями и чрезвычайно весело пили чай. Буфет обратился в теплое пристанище чуть не для половины съехавшейся публики. И однако, через несколько времени вся эта масса должна была нахлынуть в залу; страшно было и подумать.","All that night, with its almost absurd events and with the terrible ""denouement"" in the morning, still seems to me like an ugly, nightmare dream and constitutes - for me at least - the most difficult part of my chronicle. Although I was late for the ball, I nevertheless arrived at its end - it was destined to end so quickly. It was already eleven o'clock when I reached the entrance of the leader's house, where the same old White Hall, in which the reading took place, had already been, despite the short time, tidied up and prepared to serve as the main dance hall, as it was supposed, for the whole city. But no matter how badly I was in favor of the ball just this morning, I still did not foresee the full truth: not a single family from the highest circle appeared; even officials skimped a little more significantly - and this was an extremely strong feature. As for the ladies and maidens, Pyotr Stepanovich's recent calculations (now obviously insidious) turned out to be extremely wrong: extremely few came; there was hardly one lady for four men, and what ladies! “Some” wives of regimental chief officers, various post office and bureaucratic small fry, three doctors with daughters, two or three landowners from the poor, seven daughters and one niece of that secretary, whom I once mentioned above, merchants, - that did Yulia Mikhailovna expect? Even the merchants did not come halfway. As for the men, despite the compact absence of all our nobility, their mass was nevertheless dense, but it produced an ambiguous and suspicious impression. Of course, there were several very quiet and respectful officers with their wives, several of the most obedient fathers of families, like the same one, for example, the secretary, the father of his seven daughters. All this meek petty people appeared, so to speak, ""out of necessity,"" as one of these gentlemen put it. But, on the other hand, the mass of brisk persons, and, in addition, the mass of such persons, whom Pyotr Stepanovich and I suspected just now as having been let in without tickets, seemed to have increased still more than before. All of them were sitting in the cafeteria for the time being, and when they appeared, they went straight to the cafeteria, as if to a prearranged place. So at least it seemed to me. The buffet was located at the end of the suite of rooms, in a spacious hall where Prokhorych settled with all the seductions of club cuisine and with a tempting display of snacks and drinks. I noticed here several individuals in almost torn frock coats, in the most dubious, too far from ballroom costumes, obviously sobered up with exorbitant labor and for a short time, and God knows where they were taken from, some kind of out-of-town. Of course, I knew that, according to Yulia Mikhailovna's idea, it was supposed to arrange the most democratic ball, ""without refusing even the philistines, if it happened that one of them would pay for a ticket."" She could boldly utter these words in her committee, in full confidence that none of the philistines of our city, completely poor, would ever think of taking a ticket. But all the same, I doubted that these gloomy and almost ragged sergeants could be let in, despite all the democracy of the committee. But who let them in and for what purpose? Liputin and Lyamshin were already deprived of their managerial bows (although they were present at the ball, participating in the ""quadrille of literature""); but Liputin's place was taken, to my surprise, by that recent seminarian who most of all disgraced ""morning"" by his fight with Stepan Trofimovich, and Lyamshin's place was taken by Pyotr Stepanovich himself; what could be expected in such a case? I tried to listen to the conversations. Other opinions were striking in their savagery. For example, in one group they asserted that Yulia Mikhailovna had done the whole story of Stavrogin and Liza and took money from Stavrogin for this. They even mentioned the amount. It was claimed that she even arranged a holiday for this purpose; that's why half the town didn't show up when they found out what was the matter, and Lembke himself was so frapped that he ""became mentally upset,"" and she is now ""leading"" him crazy. There was a lot of laughter, too, hoarse, wild and on your own mind. Everyone also terribly criticized the ball, and Yulia Mikhailovna was scolded without any ceremony. In general, the chatter was disorderly, abrupt, intoxicated and restless, so that it was difficult to think and deduce anything. Right there in the cafeteria, simply cheerful people took shelter, there were even several ladies from those whom you can’t surprise or frighten with anything, most amiable and cheerful, for the most part all officer wives, with their husbands. They settled down at separate tables in groups and drank tea with great gaiety. The buffet turned into a warm haven for almost half of the assembled audience. And yet, after some time, all this mass was to rush into the hall; it was scary to think.","That entire night, with its almost absurd happenings and the dreadful ‘denouement’ the next morning, still haunts me like an ugly nightmarish dream and comprises — at least, for me — the most painful part of my chronicle. Although I arrived late at the ball, I did in any event arrive before it was over, though it was destined to end quickly. It was already past ten when I reached the front steps of the marshal’s house, where the same White Hall in which the readings had taken place had already been tidied up, despite the brief span of time, and made ready, as had been proposed, to serve as the main ballroom for the entire town. But no matter how unfavourably disposed I had been about the ball that morning , I still had no inkling of the full truth. Not one family from the higher circles had appeared; even officials holding positions of any importance at all had stayed away, and that was an extremely striking feature. As far as the ladies and girls were concerned, the earlier calculations of Pyotr Stepanovich (which were now obviously perfidious) had proved completely wrong. Very few people had come; for every four men there was scarcely even one lady, and what ladies, besides! Wives ‘of a sort’ of regimental middle-rank officers and of various petty officials from the post office and the civil service, three doctors’ wives with their daughters, two or three impoverished landowners’ wives, the seven daughters and one niece of the secretary I happened to mention earlier, merchants’ wives — is that what Yuliya Mikhaylovna was expecting? Even half the merchants didn’t turn up. As for the men, they were there in large numbers, despite the total absence of our entire nobility, but they created an ambiguous and suspicious impression. Of course, a few extremely quiet and deferential officers were present with their wives, and a few of the most docile fathers of families, like that same secretary, the father of seven daughters. All these humble, unimportant folk appeared, so to speak, ‘out of inevitability’, as one of these gentlemen expressed it. But on the other hand, the mass of lively characters and, in addition, the mass of those whom Pyotr Stepanovich and I suspected of having been admitted without tickets that morning, seemed to have grown larger than before. They were all sitting in the buffet for the time being; as they arrived, they passed directly into the buffet, as if it was the place they had agreed on earlier. So, at least, it seemed to me. The buffet was located at the end of a suite of rooms, in a spacious hall, where Prokhorych had installed himself with all the enticements of the club’s kitchen and with a tempting display of zakuski and drinks. Here I noticed some individuals in frock-coats that were practically ragged, attire that was extremely dubious and entirely unsuitable for a ball. They had obviously been sobered up with extraordinary difficulty and certainly wouldn’t remain so for long, and were not local people, though Lord knows where they’d been found. I knew, of course, that in keeping with an idea of Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s, it had been proposed to throw the most democratic ball possible, ‘without refusing even the tradespeople, if it should happen that some of them should pay for a ticket’. She was able to say these words boldly to her committee, in full confidence that it wouldn’t occur to any of the tradespeople of our town, all of whom were poor, to buy a ticket. But in any event I doubted that these sullen people in frock-coats that were almost ragged would have been admitted, all the democratic sentiments of the committee notwithstanding. But who admitted them, and with what purpose? Liputin and Lyamshin had already been deprived of their stewards’ rosettes (although they were present at the ball and took part in the ‘literary quadrille’); but Liputin’s place had been taken, to my surprise, by the seminary student who had created the greatest scandal that morning by his tussle with Stepan Trofimovich, and Lyamshin’s place by Pyotr Stepanovich himself. What could one possibly expect in such a case? I made an effort to listen in on the conversations. Some of the opinions expressed were striking for their wildness. In one little group, for instance, people were asserting that Yuliya Mikhaylovna had masterminded the entire affair between Stavrogin and Liza, and that she had taken money for it from Stavrogin. They even named the amount. They asserted that she had even organized the gala with that in mind; therefore, they said, half the town didn’t bother to put in an appearance once they’d learned what was up, and von Lembke himself was so stunned that ‘his reason was unhinged’, and she was now ‘leading him about’ like a madman. There was also much guffawing as well, hoarse, wild and sly. Everyone criticized the ball savagely, and abused Yuliya Mikhaylovna without any ceremony. In general, the babble was disorderly, disconnected, drunken and agitated, so that it was hard to make any sense of it or get any meaning out of it. People who simply wanted to have a good time also found refuge here in the buffet, and there were even several ladies, very agreeable and in high spirits, whom nothing could surprise or frighten, mostly all officers’ wives, with their husbands. They had arranged themselves in groups at separate small tables and were drinking tea in an extremely jolly mood. The buffet had turned into a warm refuge for almost half of the assembled public. Still and all, within a short period of time this entire mass of people would have to stream into the hall; it was dreadful even to think about it.","The whole of that night, with its almost absurd events and ghastly ""denouement"" in the morning, comes back to me even now as a hideous, nightmarish dream, and constitutes-for me at least-the most difficult part of my chronicle. Though I came late to the ball, I arrived towards the end of it anyway-so quickly was it destined to end. It was already past ten when I reached the entrance of the marshal's wife's house, where the same White Hall in which the reading took place had, despite the shortness of time, been cleared and made ready to serve as the main ballroom, it was supposed, for the whole town. But however ill-disposed I had been towards the ball that morning-even so I did not anticipate the full truth: not a single family from higher circles came; even officials of any importance at all were absent-and that was an extremely marked feature. As for ladies and young girls, here Pyotr Stepanovich's (now obviously perfidious) calculations turned out to be incorrect to the highest degree: exceedingly few had appeared; there was scarcely one lady to four men, and what ladies! "" Certain"" wives of regimental officers, of various small fry from the post office and petty clerkdom, three doctors' wives with their daughters, two or three landowners of the poorer sort, the seven daughters and one niece of that secretary I mentioned somewhere above, some merchants' wives-was this what Yulia Mikhailovna had expected? Even half of the merchants did not come. As for the men, their mass was still indeed dense, despite the compact absence of all our nobility, but produced an ambiguous and suspicious impression. Of course, there were several rather quiet and respectful officers with their wives, several most obedient fathers of families, as again, for example, that same secretary, the father of his seven daughters. All these humble small potatoes came, so to speak, ""out of inevitability,"" as one of these gentlemen put it. But, on the other hand, the mass of perky characters, and the mass, besides, of such persons as Pyotr Stepanovich and I had suspected of being let in to the matinée without tickets, seemed to have increased still more compared with the matinée. For the time being they were sitting in the buffet, and had gone straight to the buffet on arrival, as if the place had been appointed beforehand. At least it seemed so to me. The buffet was located at the end of the suite of rooms, in a spacious hall, where Prokhorych had installed himself with all the enticements of the club kitchen and with a tempting display of snacks and drinks. I noticed several personages there in all but torn frock coats, in the most dubious and utterly un-ball-like outfits, who had obviously been sobered up with boundless effort and for a short time only, and had been fetched from God knows where, perhaps from out of town. I knew, of course, that in accordance with Yulia Mikhailovna's idea it had been suggested to arrange a most democratic ball, ""not refusing even tradesmen, if any such should happen to pay for a ticket. "" She could bravely utter these words in her committee, knowing perfectly well that it would not occur to any of our town tradesmen, all of them destitute, to buy a ticket. But anyway I doubted that these gloomy, all but tattered frock-coaters ought to have been let in, despite all the democratism of the committee. Who, then, had let them in, and with what purpose? Liputin and Lyamshin had been deprived of their ushers' bows (though they were present at the ball, as participants in the ""quadrille of literature""); but Liputin's place had been taken, to my surprise, by that same seminarian who more than anyone else had made a scandal of the ""matinée"" by his skirmish with Stepan Trofimovich, and Lyamshin's by Pyotr Stepanovich himself; what, then, could be expected in such a case? I tried to listen in on conversations. Some opinions were striking in their wildness. It was maintained in one group, for example, that the whole story of Stavrogin and Liza had been fixed up by Yulia Mikhailovna, who had taken money from Stavrogin for it. The amount was even quoted. It was maintained that she had even arranged the fête for that purpose; and that was why, when they learned what was going on, half the town stayed away, and Lembke himself was so jolted that his ""reason got deranged,"" and she was now ""leading him about"" insane. There was also much guffawing, hoarse, savage, and sly. Everyone criticized the ball terribly and abused Yulia Mikhailovna without any ceremony. Generally, the babble was disorderly, fragmentary, drunken, and agitated, so that it was difficult to grasp or infer anything. Simple merrymakers also found refuge in the buffet, and there were even several ladies of the sort that can no longer be surprised or frightened by anything, most jolly and amiable, mainly officers' wives, with their husbands. They settled in groups at separate tables and had an extremely merry time drinking tea. The buffet turned into a snug haven for nearly half the assembled public. And yet in a short time this whole mass was to come pouring into the ballroom; it was terrible even to think of it."

"Но надо было идти слушать Кармазинова. Оглянувшись в последний раз за кулисами, я заметил, что тут шныряет-таки довольно постороннего народа и даже женщин, выходят и уходят. Эти «за кулисы» было довольно узкое пространство, отгороженное от публики наглухо занавесью и сообщавшееся сзади через коридор с другими комнатами. Тут наши читавшие ожидали своей очереди. Но меня особенно поразил в это мгновение следующий после Степана Трофимовича лектор. Это был тоже какой-то вроде профессора (я и теперь не знаю в точности, кто он такой), удалившийся добровольно из какого-то заведения после какой-то студенческой истории и заехавший зачем-то в наш город всего только несколько дней назад. Его тоже рекомендовали Юлии Михайловне, и она приняла его с благоговением. Я знаю теперь, что он был у ней всего только на одном вечере до чтения, весь тот вечер промолчал, двусмысленно улыбался шуткам и тону компании, окружавшей Юлию Михайловну, и на всех произвел впечатление неприятное надменным и в то же время до пугливости обидчивым своим видом. Это сама Юлия Михайловна его завербовала читать. Теперь он ходил из угла в угол и тоже, как и Степан Трофимович, шептал про себя, но смотрел в землю, а не в зеркало. Улыбок не примерял, хотя часто и плотоядно улыбался. Ясно, что и с ним тоже нельзя было говорить. Ростом он был мал, лет сорока на вид, лысый и плешивый, с седоватою бородкой, одет прилично. Но всего интереснее было, что он с каждым поворотом подымал вверх свой правый кулак, мотал им в воздухе над головою и вдруг опускал его вниз, как будто разбивая в прах какого-то сопротивника. Этот фокус проделывал он поминутно. Мне стало жутко. Поскорее побежал я слушать Кармазинова.","But I had to go and listen to Karmazinov. Looking back behind the scenes for the last time, I noticed that quite a few strangers, and even women, were sneaking around here, coming out and leaving. This ""behind the scenes"" was a rather narrow space, tightly separated from the public by a curtain and communicated behind through a corridor with other rooms. Here our readers were waiting for their turn. But I was especially struck at that moment by the next lecturer after Stepan Trofimovich. He was also some kind of professor (even now I don’t know exactly who he is), who voluntarily retired from some institution after some student story and for some reason came to our city just a few days ago. He was also recommended to Yulia Mikhailovna, and she received him with reverence. I now know that he was with her only one evening before the reading, that he remained silent all that evening, smiled ambiguously at the jokes and the tone of the company that surrounded Yulia Mikhailovna, and made an unpleasant impression on everyone by his arrogant and at the same time fearfully touchy appearance. . It was Yulia Mikhailovna herself who recruited him to read. Now he paced from corner to corner and, like Stepan Trofimovitch, whispered to himself, but looked at the ground and not in the mirror. He did not try on smiles, although he often smiled carnivorously. It is clear that it was impossible to talk to him either. He was small in stature, about forty in appearance, bald and bald, with a grayish beard, decently dressed. But the most interesting thing was that with each turn he raised his right fist up, waved it in the air above his head and suddenly lowered it down, as if crushing some opponent to dust. He did this trick every minute. I got scared. I quickly ran to listen to Karmazinov.","But I had to go and listen to Karmazinov. Looking around backstage for the last time, I noticed that a rather sizeable number of outsiders, even women, were flitting about, going in and out.

There the people who were scheduled to read awaited their turn. But I was especially struck at that moment by the speaker who was to follow Stepan Trofimovich.

I know now that he had been at her house on only one evening before the reading, had sat silently throughout that evening, had smiled ambiguously at the jokes and tone of the company assembled around Yuliya Mikhaylovna and had produced an unpleasant impression on everyone with his manner, which was haughty and at the same time timorous and hypersensitive. It was Yuliya Mikhaylovna herself who had recruited him to read. Now he was pacing from corner to corner and whispering to himself, just like Stepan Trofimovich, but looking at the floor, and not into a mirror.

"Как бы там ни было, но рабочие пришли наконец всею толпою на площадку пред губернаторским домом и выстроились чинно и молча. Затем разинули рты на крыльцо и начали ждать. Говорили мне, что они будто бы, едва стали, тотчас же и сняли шапки, то есть, может, за полчаса до появления хозяина губернии, которого, как нарочно, не случилось в ту минуту дома. Полиция тотчас же показалась, сначала в отдельных явлениях, а потом и в возможном комплекте; начала, разумеется, грозно, повелевая разойтись. Но рабочие стали в упор, как стадо баранов, дошедшее до забора, и отвечали лаконически, что они к «самому енералу»; видна была твердая решимость. Неестественные окрики прекратились; их быстро сменила задумчивость, таинственная распорядительность шепотом и суровая хлопотливая забота, сморщившая брови начальства. Полицеймейстер предпочел выждать прибытия самого фон Лембке. Это вздор, что он прилетел на тройке во весь опор и еще с дрожек будто бы начал драться. Он у нас действительно летал и любил летать в своих дрожках с желтым задком, и по мере того как «до разврата доведенные пристяжные» сходили всё больше и больше с ума, приводя в восторг всех купцов из Гостиного ряда, он подымался на дрожках, становился во весь рост, придерживаясь за нарочно приделанный сбоку ремень, и, простирая правую руку в пространство, как на монументах, обозревал таким образом город. Но в настоящем случае он не дрался, и хотя не мог же он, слетая с дрожек, обойтись без крепкого словца, но сделал это, единственно чтобы не потерять популярности. Еще более вздор, что приведены были солдаты со штыками и что по телеграфу дано было знать куда-то о присылке артиллерии и казаков: это сказки, которым не верят теперь сами изобретатели. Вздор тоже, что привезены были пожарные бочки с водой, из которых обливали народ. Просто-запросто Илья Ильич крикнул, разгорячившись, что ни один у него сух из воды не выйдет; вероятно, из этого и сделали бочки, которые и перешли таким образом в корреспонденции столичных газет. Самый верный вариант, надо полагать, состоял в том, что толпу оцепили на первый раз всеми случившимися под рукой полицейскими, а к Лембке послали нарочного, пристава первой части, который и полетел на полицеймейстерских дрожках по дороге в Скворешники, зная, что туда, назад тому полчаса, отправился фон Лембке в своей коляске…","Be that as it may, the workers finally came in their entire crowd to the square in front of the governor's house and lined up decorously and silently. Then they opened their mouths on the porch and began to wait. They told me that as soon as they got up, they immediately took off their hats, that is, maybe half an hour before the appearance of the owner of the province, who, as if on purpose, did not happen at that moment at home. The police immediately showed up, first in separate appearances, and then in a possible set; She began, of course, menacingly, ordering them to disperse. But the workers stood at point-blank range, like a herd of rams that had reached the fence, and answered succinctly that they were going to ""the general himself""; there was a strong determination. The unnatural shouting ceased; they were quickly replaced by thoughtfulness, a mysterious whispering orderliness, and a stern, troublesome concern that wrinkled the brows of the authorities. The police chief preferred to wait for the arrival of von Lembke himself. It's nonsense that he flew in a troika at full speed and even from the droshky he seemed to start fighting. He really flew with us and liked to fly in his droshky with a yellow back, and as the ""driven to debauchery tows"" went more and more crazy, enthralling all the merchants from Gostiny Ryad, he got up in the droshky, became his whole height, holding on to a belt purposely attached to the side, and, stretching his right hand into space, as on monuments, surveyed the city in this way. But in the present case, he did not fight, and although he could not, flying off the droshky, do without a strong word, he did it solely so as not to lose popularity. It is even more nonsense that soldiers with bayonets were brought in and that by telegraph it was given to know somewhere about sending artillery and Cossacks: these are fairy tales that the inventors themselves do not believe now. It is also nonsense that fire barrels with water were brought in, from which the people were poured. Simply, Ilya Ilyich shouted, heated up, that not one of him would go dry; probably, barrels were made from this, which thus passed into the correspondence of the capital's newspapers. The surest option, presumably, was that the crowd was cordoned off for the first time by all the policemen who happened at hand, and a messenger was sent to Lembka, the bailiff of the first unit, who flew in a police droshky along the road to Skvoreshniki, knowing that there, back half an hour ago, von Lembke set off in his carriage ...","Whatever the case may be, the whole crowd of workers finally arrived at the small open area in front of the governor’s house and drew themselves up respectfully and silently. Then they stood gaping at the front entrance, and started to wait. I was told as soon as they had taken their places, they proceeded to doff their hats, that is to say, perhaps half an hour before the appearance of the master of the province, who, as luck would have it, happened not to be at home just then. The police promptly showed up, at first individually, and then in as large a contingent as was possible. Naturally, they began in a threatening way, ordering the workers to disperse. But the workers just kept standing there unyieldingly, like a flock of sheep that had come to a fence, and responded laconically that they had come to see ‘himself, the general’; stubborn determination was evident. The unnatural shouts ceased; they quickly yielded to ruminations, mysterious whispered instructions and a stern, restless concern, which furrowed the brows of the superior officers. The chief of police preferred to wait for von Lembke himself to arrive. It’s nonsense to say that he dashed there full tilt in his three-horse droshky; and that he supposedly began to fight while still in the vehicle. He certainly had a reputation among us for dashing about, and he loved to dash off in his droshky with its yellow back, and as the ‘trace-horses driven to debauchery’ were growing more and more frenzied, to the utter delight of all the merchants in the shopping arcade, he would rise up in the droshky, stand fully erect, holding on to the strap that had been specially attached to the side, and flinging his right arm out into space, as statues do on monuments, survey the town in this fashion. But in the present situation he didn’t fight, and although he couldn’t dispense with uttering a strong expression as he bolted from the droshky, he did it only to avoid losing his popularity. It’s even greater nonsense to say that soldiers with bayonets were brought in and that a telegram was dispatched somewhere ordering artillery and Cossacks1 to be sent. These are fairy tales, which now are not believed even by the people who concocted them. It’s also nonsense to say that barrels of water were brought from the fire brigade, and that the crowd was drenched. The plain and simple fact was that Ilya Ilyich, in the heat of the moment, shouted that they were all wet behind the ears and nobody would get off scot-free. From this people probably proceeded to invent the barrels, which passed in this form into the newspaper columns of the two capitals. The most accurate version, one must suppose, is that at first all the crowd was cordoned off by the available policemen and a special messenger was sent to von Lembke, an officer of the first precinct, who dashed along the road to Skvoreshniki in the chief of police’s droshky, knowing that von Lembke had gone there in his carriage half an hour or so earlier.","Be that as it may, the whole crowd of workers finally arrived at the little square in front of the governor's house, and lined up decorously and silently. Then they gaped at the porch and started waiting. I was told that as soon as they installed themselves, they immediately took off their hats, that is, perhaps half an hour before the arrival of the master of the province, who, as if by design, happened to be away from home at the moment. The police made their appearance at once, first as isolated phenomena, then in the fullest possible complement; they began threateningly, of course, with an order to disperse. But the workers stood there like a flock of sheep at a fence, and answered laconically that they wanted ""the general hisself""; firm resolve was evident. The unnatural shouting ceased; it quickly yielded to pondering, mysteriously whispered instructions, and a stern, worried preoccupation that furrowed the official brow. The police chief preferred to wait for the arrival of von Lembke himself. It is nonsense that he came flying at full speed with a troika and supposedly started fighting before he got out of his droshky. Our governor did indeed fly and liked to fly around in his droshky with its yellow back, and as his ""outrunners driven to debauchery"" got wilder and wilder, to the delight of all the merchants in the shopping arcade, he would stand up in his droshky, rise to his full height, holding on to a special strap attached to the side, and, stretching his right arm into space like a monument, would thus survey the town. But in the present case he did not start fighting, and though he really could not do without strong language as he came flying off his droshky, he did it solely so as not to lose popularity. It is still greater nonsense that soldiers with bayonets were brought in, and that a message was sent somewhere by telegraph about dispatching artillery and Cossacks: these are tales that their inventors themselves no longer believe. It is also nonsense that barrels of water were brought from the firehouse and used to drench the people. Quite simply, Ilya Ilyich shouted hot-headedly that no one would escape without getting his feet wet; this must have been turned into barrels, which thus made their way into the reports of the metropolitan newspapers. The most correct version, one must suppose, was that the crowd was first surrounded by all the policemen who happened to be on hand, and a messenger was then sent to Lembke, an officer from the first precinct, who proceeded to fly down the road to Skvoreshniki in the police chief's droshky, knowing that von Lembke had set out for there half an hour earlier in his carriage..."

"Ровно без десяти минут в шесть часов в вокзале железной дороги, вдоль вытянувшегося, довольно длинного ряда вагонов, прохаживались Петр Степанович и Эркель. Петр Степанович отъезжал, а Эркель прощался с ним. Кладь была сдана, сак отнесен в вагон второго класса, на выбранное место. Первый звонок уже прозвенел, ждали второго. Петр Степанович открыто смотрел по сторонам, наблюдая входивших в вагоны пассажиров. Но близких знакомых не встретилось; всего лишь раза два пришлось ему кивнуть головой – одному купцу, которого он знал отдаленно, и потом одному молодому деревенскому священнику, отъезжавшему за две станции, в свой приход. Эркелю, видимо, хотелось в последние минуты поговорить о чем-нибудь поважнее, – хотя, может быть, он и сам не знал, о чем именно; но он всё не смел начать. Ему всё казалось, что Петр Степанович как будто с ним тяготится и с нетерпением ждет остальных звонков.","Exactly ten minutes to six o'clock at the railroad station, along a stretched out, rather long line of carriages, Pyotr Stepanovich and Erkel were pacing. Pyotr Stepanovich drove off, and Erkel said goodbye to him. The luggage was handed over, the sack was taken to the second-class carriage, to the chosen seat. The first bell had already rung, they were waiting for the second. Pyotr Stepanovich openly looked around, observing the passengers entering the carriages. But close acquaintances did not meet; only once or twice did he have to nod his head - to one merchant whom he knew remotely, and then to one young village priest, who was driving two stations away to his parish. Erkel, apparently, wanted to talk about something more important in the last minutes - although, perhaps, he himself did not know what exactly; but he did not dare to start. It seemed to him that Pyotr Stepanovich seemed to be weary of him and was impatiently waiting for the rest of the calls.","At exactly ten minutes to six, at the railway station, Pyotr Stepanovich and Erkel were walking up and down beside a rather long line of coaches. Pyotr Stepanovich was leaving, and Erkel was seeing him off. The luggage had been checked, and his bag had been carried to the seat he had chosen in a second-class coach. The first bell had already rung, and they were waiting for the second. Pyotr Stepanovich was openly looking round, observing the passengers who were getting into the coaches. But no close acquaintances were encountered; only on two occasions did he have to nod his head — once to a merchant whom he knew slightly, and then to a young village priest who was travelling to his parish two stations away. In these final moments Erkel evidently wished to talk about something important, although perhaps he himself may very well not have known about what; but he couldn’t bring himself to begin. He kept thinking that Pyotr Stepanovich found his presence burdensome, and was waiting impatiently for the second and third bells.","Exactly at ten minutes to six, at the railway station, along the rather long, strung-out line of cars, Pyotr Stepanovich and Erkel were strolling.

"Представлялся мне не раз и еще вопрос: почему он именно бежал, то есть бежал ногами, в буквальном смысле, а не просто уехал на лошадях? Я сначала объяснял это пятидесятилетнею непрактичностью и фантастическим уклонением идей под влиянием сильного чувства. Мне казалось, что мысль о подорожной и лошадях (хотя бы и с колокольчиком) должна была представляться ему слишком простою и прозаичною; напротив, пилигримство, хотя бы и с зонтиком, гораздо более красивым и мстительно-любовным. Но ныне, когда всё уже кончилось, я полагаю, что всё это тогда совершилось гораздо проще: во-первых, он побоялся брать лошадей, потому что Варвара Петровна могла проведать и задержать его силой, что наверно и исполнила бы, а он наверно бы подчинился и – прощай тогда великая идея навеки. Во-вторых, чтобы взять подорожную, надо было по крайней мере знать, куда едешь. Но именно знать об этом и составляло самое главное страдание его в ту минуту: назвать и назначить место он ни за что не мог. Ибо, решись он на какой-нибудь город, и вмиг предприятие его стало бы в собственных его глазах и нелепым и невозможным; он это очень предчувствовал. Ну что будет он делать в таком именно городе и почему не в другом? Искать се marchand?[235] Но какого marchand? Тут опять выскакивал этот второй, и уже самый страшный вопрос. В сущности, не было для него ничего страшнее, чем се marchand, которого он так вдруг сломя голову пустился отыскивать и которого, уж разумеется, всего более боялся отыскать в самом деле. Нет, уж лучше просто большая дорога, так просто выйти на нее и пойти и ни о чем не думать, пока только можно не думать. Большая дорога – это есть нечто длинное-длинное, чему не видно конца, – точно жизнь человеческая, точно мечта человеческая. В большой дороге заключается идея; а в подорожной какая идея? В подорожной конец идеи… Vive la grande route,[236] а там что бог даст.","I imagined myself more than once and another question: why exactly did he run, that is, he ran with his feet, in the literal sense, and not just left on horseback? At first I explained this by fifty years of impracticality and a fantastic deviation of ideas under the influence of strong feeling. It seemed to me that the thought of the traveler and horses (even with a bell) must have appeared to him too simple and prosaic; on the contrary, pilgrimage, even with an umbrella, is much more beautiful and vengeful-loving. But now, when it’s all over, I believe that it all happened much easier then: firstly, he was afraid to take horses, because Varvara Petrovna could visit and detain him by force, which she would probably do, and he would probably obey and - goodbye then great idea forever. Secondly, in order to take a traveler, you had to at least know where you were going. But it was precisely the knowledge of this that constituted his most important suffering at that moment: he could not name and appoint a place for anything. For if he decided on any city, and in an instant his enterprise would become in his own eyes both absurd and impossible; he felt it very much. Well, what will he do in such a particular city and why not in another? Look for this marchand?[235] But which marchand? Here again this second, and already the most terrible question jumped out. In fact, there was nothing more terrible for him than this marchand, whom he so suddenly set off headlong to look for and whom, of course, he was most afraid of finding in fact. No, it's better to just take the big road, so just go out onto it and go and not think about anything, as long as you can not think. The high road is something long, long, to which there is no end in sight, like a human life, like a human dream. In the big road lies the idea; what is the idea in the roadway? To the road end of the idea... Vive la grande route,[236] and then what God wills.","I was struck by another question more than once: why was he actually running away, that is, running with his feet, in the literal sense, and not simply going away by horse and carriage? At first I tried to explain this by the impracticality of a fifty-year-old man and a fantastic divergence of his thinking under the influence of powerful feelings. It seemed to me that the thought of hiring a series of post-horses (even if they had bells) must have struck him as too simple and prosaic; on the contrary, a pilgrimage on foot, even if with an umbrella, was much more picturesque and much more in keeping with the spirit of love and revenge. But now, when it is all over, I suppose that everything happened in a much simpler way. In the first place, he was afraid of hiring horses, because Varvara Petrovna might find out and stop him by force, which she would certainly have done and he would certainly have submitted — and then, farewell to the great idea forever. In the second place, in order to hire a series of post-horses, you at least have to know where you are going. But knowing this was precisely the greatest source of suffering for him at this juncture: he couldn’t for the life of him name and settle on a place. For, if he should decide on some town, his venture would instantly become both absurd and impossible in his own eyes; he felt that very keenly. And what exactly would he do in one particular town and not in another? Look for ce marchand? But what marchand? This second and even most terrible question came to the fore at this point. At bottom, there was nothing more terrible for him than ce marchand, whom he had so suddenly rushed off to look for as fast as he could, and whom, quite naturally, he was actually most afraid of finding. No, the high road was really the best thing; it was so simple to set off on it, and walk along it and not think of anything, as long as it was possible not to think. The high road is something eternally long, long, and no end in sight. It’s like human life, like human dreams. An idea is contained in the high road; but what idea is contained in a series of post-horses? Post-horses are the end of an idea… Vive la grande route,1 and then it’s what God will provide.","The question also presented itself to me more than once: why did he precisely run away, that is, run with his feet, in the literal sense, and not simply drive off in a carriage? At first I explained it by fifty years of impracticality and a fantastical deviation of ideas under the effect of strong emotion. It seemed to me that the thought of traveling by post in a carriage (even with bells) must have appeared too simple and prosaic to him; pilgrimage, on the other hand, even with an umbrella, was much more beautiful and vengefully amorous. But now, when everything is over, I rather suppose that at the time it all happened in a much simpler way: first, he was afraid to hire a carriage because Varvara Petrovna might get wind of it and hold him back by force, which she would certainly have done, and he would certainly have submitted, and then-good-bye forever to the great idea. Second, in order to travel by post one must at least know where one is going. But to know this precisely constituted his chief suffering at the moment: he could not name or determine upon a place for the life of him. For if he were to decide upon some town, his undertaking would instantly become both absurd and impossible in his own eyes; he sensed that very well. What was he going to do precisely in this town and not in some other? To look for ce marchand?clxii But what marchand? Here again that second and now most dreadful question popped up. In fact, there was nothing more dreadful for him than ce marchand whom he had so suddenly set off headlong in search of, and whom he was quite certainly afraid most of all to find in reality. No, better simply the high road, just simply to go out to it and go down it and not think of anything for as long as it was possible not to think. A high road is something very, very long, which one sees no end to-like human life, like the human dream. There is an idea in the high road; and what sort of idea is there in traveling by post? Traveling by post is the end of any idea. Vive la grande route,clxiii and then it's whatever God sends."

"Теснясь вслед за любопытною толпой, я без расспрашиваний добрел до главнейшего и опаснейшего пункта, где и увидел наконец Лембке, которого отыскивал по поручению самой Юлии Михайловны. Положение его было удивительное и чрезвычайное. Он стоял на обломках забора; налево от него, шагах в тридцати, высился черный скелет уже совсем почти догоревшего двухэтажного деревянного дома, с дырьями вместо окон в обоих этажах, с провалившеюся крышей и с пламенем, всё еще змеившимся кое-где по обугленным бревнам. В глубине двора, шагах в двадцати от погоревшего дома, начинал пылать флигель, тоже двухэтажный, и над ним изо всех сил старались пожарные. Направо пожарные и народ отстаивали довольно большое деревянное строение, еще не загоревшееся, но уже несколько раз загоравшееся, и которому неминуемо суждено было сгореть. Лембке кричал и жестикулировал лицом к флигелю и отдавал приказания, которых никто не исполнял. Я было подумал, что его так тут и бросили и совсем от него отступились. По крайней мере густая и чрезвычайно разнородная толпа, его окружавшая, в которой вместе со всяким людом были и господа и даже соборный протопоп, хотя и слушали его с любопытством и удивлением, но никто из них с ним не заговаривал и не пробовал его отвести. Лембке, бледный, с сверкающими глазами, произносил самые удивительные вещи; к довершению был без шляпы и уже давно потерял ее.","Crowding after the curious crowd, I made my way without questioning to the main and most dangerous point, where I finally saw Lembke, whom I was looking for on behalf of Yulia Mikhailovna herself. His position was amazing and extraordinary. He stood on the rubble of the fence; to his left, about thirty paces, rose the black skeleton of a two-story wooden house, almost completely burned out, with holes instead of windows on both floors, with a collapsed roof and with flames still snaked here and there over the charred logs. In the depths of the yard, about twenty paces from the burnt house, an outbuilding, also two-story, began to burn, and firemen tried their best to over it. To the right, firefighters and people were defending a rather large wooden structure, which had not yet caught fire, but had already caught fire several times, and which was inevitably destined to burn down. Lembke shouted and gesticulated facing the wing and gave orders that no one carried out. I thought for a moment that they had abandoned him like that and completely abandoned him. At least the dense and extremely diverse crowd that surrounded him, in which, along with all the people, there were gentlemen and even the cathedral archpriest, although they listened to him with curiosity and surprise, but none of them spoke to him and did not try to take him away. Lembke, pale, with sparkling eyes, said the most amazing things; to top it off, he was without a hat and had long since lost it.","Following close behind the curious crowd, I managed, without asking any questions, to make my way to the most important and most dangerous place, where I finally spotted von Lembke, whom I was looking for at Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s behest. His position was surprising and extraordinary. He was standing on the ruins of a fence; to his left, about thirty steps away, jutted the black skeleton of a two-storey wooden house which had almost completely finished burning now, with holes instead of windows in both storeys, with a roof that had collapsed and with a flame that was still snaking its way around the charred beams here and there. Deep inside the courtyard, about twenty steps from the burnt-out house, a smaller building, also of two storeys, was beginning to burn, and the firemen were doing the very best they could with it. To the right some firemen and ordinary people were fighting to save a rather large wooden building that had not yet burned but had already caught fire several times, and was inevitably fated to burn down. Von Lembke was shouting and gesticulating as he faced the smaller building, and kept issuing orders, which no one obeyed. It occurred to me that he had simply been abandoned there and was being utterly ignored. At least the thick and extraordinarily varied crowd that surrounded him, in which gentlemen and even the archpriest from the cathedral mingled with all kinds of people, was listening to him with curiosity and surprise, but not one of them struck up a conversation with him or made any attempt to escort him away. Von Lembke, pale and with piercing eyes, was saying the most surprising things; what’s more he was not wearing a hat, having lost it some time ago.","Plodding after the curious crowd, I made my way, without any inquiries, to the most important and dangerous spot, where I finally caught sight of Lembke, whom I was looking for on instructions from Yulia Mikhailovna herself. His position was astonishing and extraordinary. He was standing on the debris of a fence; to the left of him, about thirty steps away, towered the black skeleton of a nearly burnt-down two-story wooden house, with holes instead of windows on both floors, its roof fallen in, and flames still snaking here and there over the charred beams. At the back of the courtyard, about twenty steps away from the burnt-down house, a cottage, also two-storied, was beginning to blaze, and the firemen were working on it as hard as they could. To the right, the firemen and the people were fighting for a rather large wooden building which was not yet burning, but had already caught fire several times, and was inevitably fated to burn down. Lembke was shouting and gesticulating, his face turned towards the cottage, and issuing orders which no one obeyed. I almost thought he had simply been left there and completely abandoned. At least no one in the dense and extremely diverse crowd that surrounded him, in which, along with all kinds of people, there were also some gentlemen and even the cathedral priest, though they all listened to him with curiosity and astonishment, either spoke to him or tried to lead him away. Lembke, pale, his eyes flashing, was uttering the most astonishing things; to top it off, he was without his hat, and had lost it long ago."

"Гостей набралось множество; народ был неказистый, но разбитной. Самолюбивый и завистливый Липутин всего только два раза в год созывал гостей, но уж в эти разы не скупился. Самый почетнейший гость, Степан Трофимович, по болезни не приехал. Подавали чай, стояла обильная закуска и водка; играли на трех столах, а молодежь в ожидании ужина затеяла под фортепиано танцы. Николай Всеволодович поднял мадам Липутину – чрезвычайно хорошенькую дамочку, ужасно пред ним робевшую, – сделал с нею два тура, уселся подле, разговорил, рассмешил ее. Заметив наконец, какая она хорошенькая, когда смеется, он вдруг, при всех гостях, обхватил ее за талию и поцеловал в губы, раза три сряду, в полную сласть. Испуганная бедная женщина упала в обморок. Николай Всеволодович взял шляпу, подошел к оторопевшему среди всеобщего смятения супругу, глядя на него сконфузился и сам и, пробормотав ему наскоро: «Не сердитесь», вышел. Липутин побежал за ним в переднюю, собственноручно подал ему шубу и с поклонами проводил с лестницы. Но завтра же как раз подоспело довольно забавное прибавление к этой, в сущности невинной, истории, говоря сравнительно, – прибавление, доставившее с тех пор Липутину некоторый даже почет, которым он и сумел воспользоваться в полную свою выгоду.","There were many guests; the people were unsightly, but broken. The proud and envious Liputin called guests only twice a year, but on these occasions he was not stingy. The most honored guest, Stepan Trofimovich, did not come due to illness. Tea was served, there was a plentiful snack and vodka; they played on three tables, and the youth started dancing to the piano while waiting for dinner. Nikolai Vsevolodovich picked up Madame Liputina - an extremely pretty lady, terribly shy before him - made two rounds with her, sat down beside him, talked, made her laugh. Noticing at last how pretty she was when she laughed, he suddenly, in front of all the guests, grabbed her around the waist and kissed her on the lips, three times in a row, in full sweetness. The frightened poor woman fainted. Nikolai Vsevolodovich took his hat, went up to his spouse, who was dumbfounded in the midst of the general confusion, looking at him, he himself became embarrassed, and muttering to him hastily: “Do not be angry,” he went out. Liputin ran after him into the hall, handed him a fur coat with his own hands, and bowed him down the stairs. But tomorrow, a rather amusing addition to this essentially innocent story, speaking comparatively, just arrived in time - an addition that since then even brought Liputin some honor, which he was able to use to his full advantage.","A great many guests had gathered.

But the very next day there followed, with perfect timing, a rather amusing sequel to this essentially innocent story (comparatively speaking), a sequel which even conferred a certain esteem on Liputin from that time forward, and which he learned to use to his full advantage.","Many guests assembled; they were unsightly but rollicksome people.

"Петр Степанович забежал раза два и к родителю, и, к несчастию моему, оба раза в мое отсутствие. В первый раз посетил его в среду, то есть на четвертый лишь день после той первой встречи, да и то по делу. Кстати, расчет по имению окончился у них как-то неслышно и невидно. Варвара Петровна взяла всё на себя и всё выплатила, разумеется приобретя землицу, а Степана Трофимовича только уведомила о том, что всё кончено, и уполномоченный Варвары Петровны, камердинер ее Алексей Егорович, поднес ему что-то подписать, что он и исполнил молча и с чрезвычайным достоинством. Замечу по поводу достоинства, что я почти не узнавал нашего прежнего старичка в эти дни. Он держал себя как никогда прежде, стал удивительно молчалив, даже не написал ни одного письма Варваре Петровне с самого воскресенья, что я счел бы чудом, а главное, стал спокоен. Он укрепился на какой-то окончательной и чрезвычайной идее, придававшей ему спокойствие, это было видно. Он нашел эту идею, сидел и чего-то ждал. Сначала, впрочем, был болен, особенно в понедельник; была холерина. Тоже и без вестей пробыть не мог во всё время; но лишь только я, оставляя факты? переходил к сути дела и высказывал какие-нибудь предположения, то он тотчас же начинал махать на меня руками, чтоб я перестал. Но оба свидания с сынком все-таки болезненно на него подействовали, хотя и не поколебали.

At first, however, he was ill, especially on Monday; had cholera. He also could not stay without news all the time; but just me, leaving the facts? went to the heart of the matter and expressed some assumptions, then he immediately began to wave his hands at me so that I would stop.

"В таком положении были дела, когда в городе всё еще продолжали верить в вальтасаровский пир, то есть в буфет от комитета; верили до последнего часа. Даже барышни мечтали о множестве конфет и варенья и еще чего-то неслыханного. Все знали, что сбор осуществился богатейший, что ломится весь город, что едут из уездов и недостает билетов. Известно было тоже, что сверх положенной цены состоялись и значительные пожертвования: Варвара Петровна, например, заплатила за свой билет триста рублей и отдала на украшение залы все цветы из своей оранжереи. Предводительша (член комитета) дала дом и освещение; клуб – музыку и прислугу и на весь день уступил Прохорыча. Были и еще пожертвования, хотя и не столь крупные, так что даже приходила мысль сбавить первоначальную цену билета с трех рублей на два. Комитет действительно сперва опасался, что по три рубля не поедут барышни, и предлагал устроить как-нибудь билеты посемейные, а именно, чтобы каждое семейство платило за одну лишь барышню, а все остальные барышни, принадлежащие к этой фамилии, хотя бы в числе десяти экземпляров, входили даром. Но все опасения оказались напрасными: напротив, барышни-то и явились. Даже самые беднейшие чиновники привезли своих девиц, и слишком ясно, не будь у них девиц, им самим и в мысль не пришло бы подписаться. Один ничтожнейший секретарь привез всех своих семерых дочерей, не считая, разумеется, супруги, и еще племянницу, и каждая из этих особ держала в руке входной трехрублевый билет. Можно, однако, представить, какая была в городе революция! Взять уже то, что так как праздник был разделен на два отделения, то и костюмов дамских потребовалось по два на каждую – утренний для чтения и бальный для танцев. Многие из среднего класса, как оказалось потом, заложили к этому дню всё, даже семейное белье, даже простыни и чуть ли не тюфяки нашим жидам, которых, как нарочно, вот уже два года ужасно много укрепилось в нашем городе и наезжает чем дальше, тем больше. Почти все чиновники забрали вперед жалованье, а иные помещики продали необходимый скот, и всё только чтобы привезти маркизами своих барышень и быть никого не хуже. Великолепие костюмов на сей раз было по нашему месту неслыханное. Город еще за две недели был начинен семейными анекдотами, которые все тотчас же переносились ко двору Юлии Михайловны нашими зубоскалами. Стали ходить семейные карикатуры. Я сам видел в альбоме Юлии Михайловны несколько в этом роде рисунков. Обо всем этом стало слишком хорошо известно там, откуда выходили анекдоты; вот почему, мне кажется, и наросла такая ненависть в семействах к Юлии Михайловне в самое последнее время. Теперь все бранятся и, вспоминая, скрежещут зубами. Но ясно было еще заране, что не угоди тогда в чем-нибудь комитет, оплошай в чем-нибудь бал, и взрыв негодования будет неслыханный. Вот почему всяк про себя и ожидал скандала; а если уж так его ожидали, то как мог он не осуществиться?","Things were in such a state when the city still continued to believe in the Belshazzar feast, that is, in the buffet from the committee; believed until the last hour. Even young ladies dreamed of a lot of sweets and jams and something else unheard of. Everyone knew that the collection had been very rich, that the whole city was bursting, that they were coming from the districts and there were not enough tickets. It was also known that significant donations were made in excess of the price: Varvara Petrovna, for example, paid three hundred rubles for her ticket and donated all the flowers from her greenhouse to decorate the hall. The leader (committee member) gave the house and lighting; club - music and servants, and for the whole day gave way to Prokhorych. There were other donations, although not so large, so that even the idea came to reduce the original ticket price from three rubles to two. At first, the committee was really afraid that young ladies would not go for three rubles, and suggested somehow arranging family tickets, namely, that each family would pay for only one young lady, and all other young ladies belonging to this surname, at least in the number of ten copies , were included as a gift. But all fears turned out to be in vain: on the contrary, the young ladies did come. Even the poorest officials brought their maidens, and it is too clear that if they did not have maidens, they themselves would not have even thought of signing. One most insignificant secretary brought all his seven daughters, not counting, of course, his wife, and also his niece, and each of these persons held in her hand an entry ticket of three rubles. One can, however, imagine what a revolution was in the city! Take already the fact that since the holiday was divided into two sections, it took two ladies' costumes for each - morning for reading and ballroom for dancing. Many of the middle class, as it turned out later, pawned everything by that day, even family linen, even sheets and almost mattresses to our Jews, who, as if on purpose, had been terribly numerous in our city for two years now and run over more and more. more. Almost all officials took their salaries in advance, and some landowners sold the necessary cattle, and all just to bring their young ladies as marquises and be no worse than anyone. The splendor of the costumes this time was unheard of in our place. For two weeks the city was filled with family anecdotes, which were immediately transferred to the court of Yulia Mikhailovna by our scoffers. Family cartoons began to circulate. I myself saw several drawings of this kind in Yulia Mikhailovna's album. All this became too well known where the anecdotes came from; that is why, it seems to me, such hatred has grown in families towards Yulia Mikhailovna in the most recent time. Now everyone scolds and, remembering, gnashes their teeth. But it was clear even beforehand that if you didn't please the Committee in something, you would blunder the ball in something, and the outburst of indignation would be unheard of. That is why everyone silently expected a scandal; and if it was so expected, how could it not come true?","This was the state of affairs, while people in town continued to believe in a Belshazzar’s feast, that is, in a buffet provided by the committee; they went on believing until the very last moment. Even the young ladies were dreaming of lots of sweets and jam and things even more wonderful. Everyone knew that a very sizeable amount of money had been collected, that the entire town would be breaking down the doors, that people would be coming in from the outlying districts and that there wouldn’t be enough tickets. It was also known that over and above the fixed price there had been considerable contributions as well: Varvara Petrovna, for instance, had paid three hundred roubles for her ticket and had donated all the flowers from her greenhouse to decorate the hall. The wife of the marshal of the nobility (a member of the committee) had provided her house and the lighting; the club had furnished the music and the servants, and had released Prokhorych for the entire day. There were other contributions as well, although by no means so large, so that there was even some thought of reducing the initial price of a ticket from three roubles to two. In fact, the committee at first was afraid that the young ladies wouldn’t come for three roubles each, and proposed that a system of family tickets be somehow established, namely, that each family should pay for only one young lady, and that all the other young ladies who were members of a particular family, even if there were as many as ten, should be admitted at no charge. But all fears proved groundless: on the contrary, it was precisely the young ladies who did appear. Even the poorest of the clerks brought their girls, and it was abundantly clear that if they hadn’t had girls, it wouldn’t have occurred to them for a moment to subscribe. One highly insignificant little secretary brought all seven of his daughters, not to mention, of course, his wife, as well as a niece, and each of these persons was holding a three-rouble ticket of admission in her hand. One can just imagine, then, the revolution that swept through the town! Just take the fact that since the gala was divided into two segments, each lady needed two costumes — a morning one for the reading, and a ball gown for the dancing. Many from the middle class, as it later turned out, had pawned everything for that day, even the family linen, even the sheets and almost the mattresses, to our Jews, who, as if on purpose, had entrenched themselves in our town in awfully large numbers over the past two years, with more of them arriving as time went on. Almost all the clerks had taken an advance on their pay, and some landowners had sold livestock they couldn’t do without, all just so they could bring their young ladies dressed as marquises, and be no worse than anyone else. The magnificence of the costumes on this occasion was unheard of in our parts. For the past two weeks the town had been awash in funny stories about various families, all of which were promptly conveyed to the court of Yuliya Mikhaylovna by our local wits. Caricatures of families began to pass from hand to hand. I myself saw several drawings of this kind in Yuliya Mikhaylovna’s album. All this became known only too well to the people who were the source of the funny stories; that’s why, I think, hatred of Yuliya Mikhaylovna had increased so much of late in those families. Now everyone curses and gnashes his teeth when they remember it. But it was clear even beforehand that if the committee should fail to please in some way, or if something should go wrong at the ball, there would be an unprecedented explosion of indignation. That’s why everyone secretly expected a scandal; and if people were actually expecting it, how could it fail to come to pass?","Thus matters stood, while in town people still went on believing in a Belshazzar's feast-that is, in the committee buffet; they believed in it to the last hour. Even the young ladies dreamed of quantities of candies and preserves and other unheard-of things. Everyone knew that the collection realized was abundant, that the whole town would be storming the doors, that people were coming in from the country, and there were not enough tickets. It was also known that beyond the fixed price there had also been considerable donations: Varvara Petrovna, for example, had paid three hundred roubles for her ticket and provided all the flowers from her greenhouse to decorate the hall. The marshal's wife (a committee member) provided her house and the lighting; the club provided the music and servants, and released Prokhorych for the whole day. There were other donations, though not such big ones, so that there was even a thought of lowering the original ticket price from three roubles to two. The committee indeed feared at first that the young ladies would not come for three roubles, and suggested arranging family tickets somehow-namely, by asking each family to pay for just one young lady, while all other young ladies of the same name, even an edition of ten, would come free. But all fears proved groundless: on the contrary, it was precisely the young ladies who did come. Even the poorest officials brought their girls, and it was only too clear that if they had not had girls, it would never have occurred to them to subscribe. One most insignificant secretary brought all seven of his daughters, not to mention his wife, of course, and also his niece, and each of these persons held a three-rouble entrance ticket in her hand. One can imagine, however, what a revolution went on in town! Take merely the fact that the fête was divided into two parts, and thus for each lady two costumes were necessary-a morning gown for the reading, and a ball gown for the dancing. Many of the middle class, it turned out later, pawned everything for that day, even the family linen, even their sheets and almost their mattresses, to the local Jews, who, over the past two years, as if on purpose, had been settling in terrible quantities in our town, and keep coming more and more. Almost all the officials took an advance on their salaries, and some landowners sold much-needed cattle, and all this just so as to bring their young ladies looking like real marquises, and to be no worse than others. The magnificence of the costumes this time was, considering the place, unheard-of. Two weeks beforehand the town was already stuffed with family anecdotes, all of which were immediately carried to Yulia Mikhailovna's court by our witlings. Family caricatures were passed around. I myself saw several drawings of this sort in Yulia Mikhailovna's album. All this became only too well known there where the anecdotes originated; that, it seems to me, is why such hatred for Yulia Mikhailovna had built up lately in these families. Now they all curse and gnash their teeth when they recall it. But it was clear beforehand that if the committee should fail to please in some way, were the ball to go amiss somehow, there would be an unheard-of outburst of indignation. That is why everyone was secretly expecting a scandal; and if it was so expected, how then could it not take place?"

"Она сама сочинила ему даже костюм, в котором он и проходил всю свою жизнь. Костюм был изящен и характерен: длиннополый черный сюртук, почти доверху застегнутый, но щегольски сидевший; мягкая шляпа (летом соломенная) с широкими полями; галстук белый, батистовый, с большим узлом и висячими концами; трость с серебряным набалдашником, при этом волосы до плеч. Он был темно-рус, и волосы его только в последнее время начали немного седеть. Усы и бороду он брил. Говорят, в молодости он был чрезвычайно красив собой. Но, по-моему, и в старости был необыкновенно внушителен. Да и какая же старость в пятьдесят три года? Но, по некоторому гражданскому кокетству, он не только не молодился, но как бы и щеголял солидностию лет своих, и в костюме своем, высокий, сухощавый, с волосами до плеч, походил как бы на патриарха или, еще вернее, на портрет поэта Кукольника, литографированный в тридцатых годах при каком-то издании, особенно когда сидел летом в саду, на лавке, под кустом расцветшей сирени, опершись обеими руками на трость, с раскрытою книгой подле и поэтически задумавшись над закатом солнца. Насчет книг замечу, что под конец он стал как-то удаляться от чтения. Впрочем, это уж под самый конец. Газеты и журналы, выписываемые Варварой Петровной во множестве, он читал постоянно. Успехами русской литературы тоже постоянно интересовался, хотя и нисколько не теряя своего достоинства. Увлекся было когда-то изучением высшей современной политики наших внутренних и внешних дел, но вскоре, махнув рукой, оставил предприятие. Бывало и то: возьмет с собою в сад Токевиля, а в кармашке несет спрятанного Поль де Кока. Но, впрочем, это пустяки.","She herself composed even a costume for him, in which he passed all his life. The costume was elegant and characteristic: a long-brimmed black frock coat, buttoned almost to the top, but smartly sitting; soft hat (straw in summer) with wide brim; a white batiste tie with a large knot and hanging ends; a cane with a silver head, and shoulder-length hair. He was dark blond, and his hair has only recently begun to turn a little gray. He shaved his mustache and beard. They say that in his youth he was extremely handsome. But, in my opinion, even in old age he was unusually impressive. And what is old age at fifty-three? But, due to some civil coquetry, he not only did not look young, but, as it were, flaunted the solidity of his years, and in his suit, tall, lean, with shoulder-length hair, he looked like a patriarch, or, more correctly, like a portrait of the poet Puppeteer. , lithographed in the thirties with some edition, especially when he sat in the summer in the garden, on a bench, under a bush of blossoming lilacs, leaning with both hands on a cane, with an open book beside him and poetically thinking about the sunset. As for books, I note that in the end he began to somehow move away from reading. However, this is at the very end. Newspapers and magazines, subscribed by Varvara Petrovna in a multitude, he read constantly. He was also constantly interested in the successes of Russian literature, although without losing his dignity at all. I was once carried away by the study of the highest modern policy of our internal and external affairs, but soon, with a wave of his hand, left the enterprise. It also happened: he would take with him to the garden of Toqueville, and in his pocket he carried the hidden Paul de Kock. But, however, this is nonsense.","She herself had even created a costume for him, in which he walked around for the rest of his life. The costume was elegant and what one would expect: a black frock-coat with long skirts, buttoned almost to the top, but which looked stylish on him; a soft hat (straw in the summer) with a wide brim; a white cambric tie, with a large knot and dangling ends; a walking stick with a silver handle; all topped off with his hair down to his shoulders. His hair was dark brown, and only recently had begun to go a bit grey. He was clean-shaven. People said that in his youth he had been extremely handsome. But in my opinion, even in his old age he was unusually striking. Besides, how can one talk of old age at fifty-three? But because of a certain coquettish sense of his position as a civic figure, he not only didn’t try to look younger, but even seemed to flaunt the solidity of his years, and in his costume — tall, lean, with shoulder-length hair, he looked something like a patriarch, or rather, like the lithograph portrait of the poet Kukolnik24 made in the 1830s for some edition of his works, especially when he was sitting in the garden in the summer, on a bench, under a blossoming lilac bush, both hands resting on his walking stick, a book open beside him and poetically contemplating the setting sun. Regarding books, I will note that towards the end he somehow began to give up reading. However, this was at the very end. The profusion of newspapers and journals to which Varvara Petrovna subscribed were his constant reading. He also took a constant interest in the achievements of Russian literature, although without the slightest loss of a sense of his own worth. At one point he became keen on studying the higher politics of our present-day domestic and foreign affairs, but soon, with a wave of his hand, he dropped the project. It also sometimes happened that he would take Tocqueville into the garden with him, and carry a Paul de Kock25 hidden in his pocket. However, all that’s just a trivial detail.","She herself even invented a costume for him, in which he went about all his life.

His hair was dark brown and only recently had begun to go a bit gray. He shaved his beard and moustache. He was said to have been extremely handsome as a young man. But, in my opinion, as an old man he was also remarkably imposing. And how old is fifty-three? Still, out of a certain civic coquetry, he not only did not try to look younger, but seemed to flaunt the solidity of his years, and in his costume, tall, lean, with hair falling to his shoulders, he resembled a patriarch, as it were, or, more precisely, the portrait of the poet Kukolnik12 in a lithograph from some edition of the thirties, especially when he sat in the garden in summer, on a bench, under a flowering lilac bush, leaning with both hands on his cane, an open book beside him, poetically pondering the sunset.

"Затем произошло нечто до того безобразное и быстрое, что Петр Степанович никак не мог потом уладить свои воспоминания в каком-нибудь порядке. Едва он дотронулся до Кириллова, как тот быстро нагнул голову и головой же выбил из рук его свечку; подсвечник полетел со звоном на пол, и свеча потухла. В то же мгновение он почувствовал ужасную боль в мизинце своей левой руки. Он закричал, и ему припомнилось только, что он вне себя три раза изо всей силы ударил револьвером по голове припавшего к нему и укусившего ему палец Кириллова. Наконец палец он вырвал и сломя голову бросился бежать из дому, отыскивая в темноте дорогу. Вослед ему из комнаты летели страшные крики:","Then something so ugly and swift happened that Pyotr Stepanovich could not put his memories in any order afterward.

At that moment, he felt a terrible pain in the little finger of his left hand. He screamed, and all he remembered was that he, beside himself, had hit Kirillov three times with all his might on the head with his revolver, who had crouched down beside him and bit his finger.

Terrible cries flew from the room after him:","Then something so hideous happened so quickly that afterwards Pyotr Stepanovich could never put his recollections into any sort of order.

"Вообще говоря, если осмелюсь выразить и мое мнение в таком щекотливом деле, все эти наши господа таланты средней руки, принимаемые, по обыкновению, при жизни их чуть не за гениев, – не только исчезают чуть не бесследно и как-то вдруг из памяти людей, когда умирают, но случается, что даже и при жизни их, чуть лишь подрастет новое поколение, сменяющее то, при котором они действовали, – забываются и пренебрегаются всеми непостижимо скоро. Как-то это вдруг у нас происходит, точно перемена декорации на театре. О, тут совсем не то, что с Пушкиными, Гоголями, Мольерами, Вольтерами, со всеми этими деятелями, приходившими сказать свое новое слово! Правда и то, что и сами эти господа таланты средней руки, на склоне почтенных лет своих, обыкновенно самым жалким образом у нас исписываются, совсем даже и не замечая того. Нередко оказывается, что писатель, которому долго приписывали чрезвычайную глубину идей и от которого ждали чрезвычайного и серьезного влияния на движение общества, обнаруживает под конец такую жидкость и такую крохотность своей основной идейки, что никто даже и не жалеет о том, что он так скоро умел исписаться. Но седые старички не замечают того и сердятся. Самолюбие их, именно под конец их поприща, принимает иногда размеры, достойные удивления. Бог знает за кого они начинают принимать себя, – по крайней мере за богов. Про Кармазинова рассказывали, что он дорожит связями своими с сильными людьми и с обществом высшим чуть не больше души своей. Рассказывали, что он вас встретит, обласкает, прельстит, обворожит своим простодушием, особенно если вы ему почему-нибудь нужны и, уж разумеется, если вы предварительно были ему зарекомендованы. Но при первом князе, при первой графине, при первом человеке, которого он боится, он почтет священнейшим долгом забыть вас с самым оскорбительным пренебрежением, как щепку, как муху, тут же, когда вы еще не успели от него выйти; он серьезно считает это самым высоким и прекрасным тоном. Несмотря на полную выдержку и совершенное знание хороших манер, он до того, говорят, самолюбив, до такой истерики, что никак не может скрыть своей авторской раздражительности даже и в тех кругах общества, где мало интересуются литературой. Если же случайно кто-нибудь озадачивал его своим равнодушием, то он обижался болезненно и старался отмстить.","Generally speaking, if I dare to express my opinion in such a delicate matter, all these gentlemen of our middle class, who, as usual, during their lifetime are almost taken for geniuses, not only disappear almost without a trace and somehow suddenly from the memory of people when they die, but it happens that even during their lifetime, as soon as a new generation grows up, replacing the one under which they acted, they are forgotten and neglected by all incomprehensibly soon. Somehow it suddenly happens with us, like a change of scenery in the theater. Oh, it’s not at all like with Pushkins, Gogols, Molières, Voltaires, with all these figures who came to say their new word! It is also true that these gentlemen themselves, the talents of an average hand, in the declining years of their venerable years, are usually used up among us in the most miserable way, without even noticing it. It often turns out that a writer, to whom an extraordinary depth of ideas has long been attributed and from whom an extraordinary and serious influence on the movement of society was expected, finally reveals such liquidity and such tinyness of his main idea that no one even regrets that he was able to sign off. But the gray-haired old men do not notice this and are angry. Their vanity, precisely at the end of their career, sometimes takes on proportions worthy of surprise. God knows what they begin to take themselves for - at least for the gods. It was said about Karmazinov that he values his ties with strong people and with higher society almost more than his soul. They said that he would meet you, caress you, seduce you, charm you with his innocence, especially if he needs you for some reason and, of course, if you were previously recommended to him. But in the presence of the first prince, in the presence of the first countess, in the presence of the first person whom he is afraid of, he will consider it his most sacred duty to forget you with the most insulting disdain, like a chip, like a fly, right there, when you have not yet had time to leave him; he seriously considers it the highest and most beautiful tone. Despite complete restraint and a perfect knowledge of good manners, he is so proud, they say, to such hysteria that he can in no way hide his authorial irritability even in those circles of society where there is little interest in literature. If, by chance, someone puzzled him with his indifference, then he was painfully offended and tried to take revenge.","Generally speaking, if I may take the liberty of expressing my own opinion on such a delicate matter, all our talented gentlemen of the middling sort, who are usually regarded as nothing short of geniuses during their lifetime, not only disappear from people’s memory when they die, rather suddenly somehow and virtually without a trace, but it also happens that even during their lifetime, as soon as a new generation comes of age and takes the place of the one in which they have been active, they are mysteriously forgotten and neglected by all. In our country this somehow happens all of a sudden, like changing the scenery in a theatre. Oh, it’s not at all the same thing as with the Pushkins, Gogols, Moliéres and Voltaires,1 with all those figures who had come to utter their new word! It’s also true that these talented gentlemen of the middling sort here in Russia usually write themselves out in the most pitiable way in the declining period of their distinguished years, without even noticing it in the least. Not infrequently it turns out that a writer whom people have long credited with an extraordinary depth of ideas and whom they have expected to exert an extraordinary and major influence on the direction of society, displays in the end such a watered-down and minuscule version of his basic little idea that no one is even sorry that he’s succeeded in writing himself out. But the grey-haired little old men don’t notice this and become angry. Their vanity, just towards the end of their careers, sometimes reaches proportions that are truly astonishing. Heaven knows who it is they begin to take themselves for — for gods, at the very least. About Karmazinov it was said that he cherished his connections with powerful people and higher society almost more than his own soul. It was said that he would meet you, treat you kindly, flatter you and charm you with his open-heartedness, especially if he needed you somehow, and, quite naturally, if you’d been recommended to him ahead of time. But let the first prince come along, the first countess, the first person he fears, and he would consider it his most sacred duty to forget all about you in the most insulting and offhanded manner, as if you were a splinter of wood, a fly, right then and there, before you even had time to leave his presence. He regards this in all seriousness as the most refined and elegant form. Despite his complete self-possession and his thorough knowledge of good manners, he is so vain, they say, so hysterically vain, that he is utterly unable to conceal his authorial annoyance even in those circles of society where people take little interest in literature. But if by chance someone should unexpectedly display utter indifference towards him, then he would become morbidly offended and would try to take his revenge.","Generally speaking, if I dare express my own opinion in such a ticklish matter, all these gentlemen talents of the average sort, who are usually taken almost for geniuses in their lifetime, not only vanish from people's memory almost without a trace and somehow suddenly when they die, but it happens that even in their lifetime, as soon as a new generation grows up to replace the one in whose time they were active-they are forgotten and scorned by everyone inconceivably quickly. This happens somehow suddenly with us, like a change of sets in the theater. Oh, it is quite another matter than with the Pushkins, Gogols, Molières, Voltaires,2 with all these figures who came to speak their new word! It is also true that these gentlemen talents of the average sort, in the decline of their venerable age, usually write themselves out in a most pathetic way, without even noticing it at all. Not infrequently it turns out that a writer to whom an extreme profundity of ideas had long been attributed, and from whom an extreme and serious influence upon the movement of society was expected, in the end displays such thinness and puniness in his basic little idea that no one is even sorry that he has managed to write himself out so quickly. But the old graybeards do not notice this and get angry. Their vanity, precisely towards the end of their career, sometimes takes on proportions worthy of wonder. God knows who they begin to think they are-gods, at the least. It was said of Karmazinov that he valued his connections with influential people and with higher society almost more than his soul. It was said that he would meet you, show you kindness, seduce you, charm you with his ingenuousness, especially if he needed you for some reason, and most certainly if you had been recommended to him beforehand. But at the first prince, at the first countess, at the first person he was in fear of, he would regard it as his sacred duty to forget you with the most insulting disdain, like a speck, like a fly, then and there, even before you had time to leave him; he seriously considered it the most lofty and beautiful tone. In spite of his complete self-possession and perfect knowledge of good manners, he was said to be so vain, to the point of such hysterics, that he was simply unable to conceal his authorial petulance, even in those social circles where there was little interest in literature. And if someone chanced to confound him with their indifference, he would be morbidly offended and seek to revenge himself."

"– Слушайте, Ставрогин: горы сравнять – хорошая мысль, не смешная. Я за Шигалева! Не надо образования, довольно науки! И без науки хватит материалу на тысячу лет, но надо устроиться послушанию. В мире одного только недостает: послушания. Жажда образования есть уже жажда аристократическая. Чуть-чуть семейство или любовь, вот уже и желание собственности. Мы уморим желание: мы пустим пьянство, сплетни, донос; мы пустим неслыханный разврат; мы всякого гения потушим в младенчестве. Всё к одному знаменателю, полное равенство. «Мы научились ремеслу, и мы честные люди, нам не надо ничего другого» – вот недавний ответ английских рабочих. Необходимо лишь необходимое – вот девиз земного шара отселе. Но нужна и судорога; об этом позаботимся мы, правители. У рабов должны быть правители. Полное послушание, полная безличность, но раз в тридцать лет Шигалев пускает и судорогу, и все вдруг начинают поедать друг друга, до известной черты, единственно чтобы не было скучно. Скука есть ощущение аристократическое; в шигалевщине не будет желаний. Желание и страдание для нас, а для рабов шигалевщина.","“Listen, Stavrogin: leveling the mountains is a good idea, not a funny one. I'm for Shigalev! No need for education, enough science!

"– Господа, – обратился ко всем Петр Степанович, – теперь мы разойдемся. Без сомнения, вы должны ощущать ту свободную гордость, которая сопряжена с исполнением свободного долга. Если же теперь, к сожалению, встревожены для подобных чувств, то, без сомнения, будете ощущать это завтра, когда уже стыдно будет не ощущать. На слишком постыдное волнение Лямшина я соглашаюсь смотреть как на бред, тем более что он вправду, говорят, еще с утра болен. А вам, Виргинский, один миг свободного размышления покажет, что ввиду интересов общего дела нельзя было действовать на честное слово, а надо именно так, как мы сделали. Последствия вам укажут, что был донос. Я согласен забыть ваши восклицания. Что до опасности, то никакой не предвидится. Никому и в голову не придет подозревать из нас кого-нибудь, особенно если вы сами сумеете повести себя; так что главное дело все-таки зависит от вас же и от полного убеждения, в котором, надеюсь, вы утвердитесь завтра же. Для того, между прочим, вы и сплотились в отдельную организацию свободного собрания единомыслящих, чтобы в общем деле разделить друг с другом, в данный момент, энергию и, если надо, наблюдать и замечать друг за другом. Каждый из вас обязан высшим отчетом. Вы призваны обновить дряхлое и завонявшее от застоя дело; имейте всегда это пред глазами для бодрости. Весь ваш шаг пока в том, чтобы всё рушилось: и государство и его нравственность. Останемся только мы, заранее предназначившие себя для приема власти: умных приобщим к себе, а на глупцах поедем верхом. Этого вы не должны конфузиться. Надо перевоспитать поколение, чтобы сделать достойным свободы. Еще много тысяч предстоит Шатовых. Мы организуемся, чтобы захватить направление; что праздно лежит и само на нас рот пялит, того стыдно не взять рукой. Сейчас я отправлюсь к Кириллову, и к утру получится тот документ, в котором он, умирая, в виде объяснения с правительством, примет всё на себя. Ничего не может быть вероятнее такой комбинации. Во-первых, он враждовал с Шатовым; они жили вместе в Америке, стало быть, имели время поссориться. Известно, что Шатов изменил убеждения; значит, у них вражда из-за убеждений и боязни доноса, – то есть самая непрощающая. Всё это так и будет написано. Наконец, упомянется, что у него, в доме Филиппова, квартировал Федька. Таким образом, всё это совершенно отдалит от вас всякое подозрение, потому что собьет все эти бараньи головы с толку. Завтра, господа, мы уже не увидимся; я на самый короткий срок отлучусь в уезд. Но послезавтра вы получите мои сообщения. Я бы советовал вам собственно завтрашний день просидеть по домам. Теперь мы отправимся все по двое разными дорогами. Вас, Толкаченко, я прошу заняться Лямшиным и отвести его домой. Вы можете на него подействовать и, главное, растолковать, до какой степени он первый себе повредит своим малодушием. В вашем родственнике Шигалеве, господин Виргинский, я, равно как и в вас, не хочу сомневаться: он не донесет. Остается сожалеть о его поступке; но, однако, он еще не заявил, что оставляет общество, а потому хоронить его еще рано. Ну – скорее же, господа; там хоть и бараньи головы, но осторожность все-таки не мешает…","“Gentlemen,” Pyotr Stepanovich addressed everyone, “now we will disperse. No doubt you must feel that free pride that comes with free duty. If now, unfortunately, you are alarmed for such feelings, then, no doubt, you will feel it tomorrow, when you will be ashamed not to feel it. I agree to look at Lyamshin's too shameful excitement as nonsense, especially since he really, they say, has been ill since morning. And to you, Virginsky, a moment of free reflection will show that, in view of the interests of the common cause, it was impossible to act on your word of honor, but it was necessary exactly as we did. The consequences will show you that there was a denunciation. I agree to forget your exclamations. As far as danger, none is foreseen. It would never occur to anyone to suspect any of us, especially if you manage to behave yourself; so that the main thing still depends on you and on complete conviction, in which, I hope, you will be confirmed tomorrow. For this, by the way, you have rallied into a separate organization of a free meeting of like-minded people in order to share energy with each other at the moment and, if necessary, to observe and notice each other. Each of you owes the highest account. You are called to renew a decrepit and stinking business; always keep this before your eyes for cheerfulness. Your whole step so far is to make everything collapse: both the state and its morality. Only we will remain, having predetermined ourselves to receive power: we will attach the smart to ourselves, and we will ride on the fools. You shouldn't be embarrassed about this. It is necessary to re-educate the generation in order to make it worthy of freedom. There are still many thousands of Shatovs to come. We organize to seize the direction; what lies idly and stares at us with its own mouth, it is a shame not to take it with your hand. Now I will go to Kirillov, and by morning I will get the document in which he, dying, in the form of an explanation with the government, will take everything upon himself. Nothing could be more likely than such a combination. First, he was at enmity with Shatov; they lived together in America, so they had time to quarrel. It is known that Shatov changed his beliefs; it means that they have enmity because of their convictions and fear of denunciation - that is, the most unforgiving. This is how it will be written. Finally, it will be mentioned that Fedka lodged in Filippov's house. In this way, all this will completely remove any suspicion from you, because it will confuse all these sheep's heads. Tomorrow, gentlemen, we will no longer see each other; I will leave for the county for the shortest possible time. But the day after tomorrow you will receive my messages. I would advise you to actually sit at home tomorrow. Now we will all go two different ways. I ask you, Tolkachenko, to take care of Lyamshin and take him home. You can influence him and, most importantly, explain to what extent he will be the first to hurt himself with his cowardice. I don't want to doubt your relative Shigalev, Mr. Virginsky, just as I don't want to doubt you: he won't inform. It remains to regret his act; but, however, he has not yet declared that he is leaving society, and therefore it is too early to bury him. Well, rather, gentlemen; even though there are sheep's heads, caution still does not interfere ...","‘Gentlemen,’ Pyotr Stepanovich turned to them all. ‘Now we’ll go our separate ways. Undoubtedly you should now be feeling that proud sense of freedom that is associated with the fulfilment of an obligation freely undertaken. But if you are now unfortunately too upset to experience such feelings, you will undoubtedly feel them tomorrow, when it would be a shame not to feel them. I agree to regard Lyamshin’s extremely shameful state of agitation as delirium, the more so since they say he really has been ill since this morning. And as for you, Virginsky, one moment of free reflection will show you that in view of the interests of the common cause it was impossible to act on someone’s word of honour, but that we had to do precisely as we did. Subsequent events will show that there was a denunciation. I am willing to forget your cries of protest. As for danger, none is foreseen. It won’t even enter anyone’s head to suspect any of us, especially if you manage to behave yourselves. So the main thing still depends on you yourselves and on your complete conviction, which I hope you will find confirmed by tomorrow. And that is why, by the way, you have closed ranks in a separate organization freely assembled from like-minded people: so that in the common cause you share in your efforts at a given moment, and, if need be, observe and keep an eye on one another. Each of you is accountable to a higher authority. You are called upon to renew a cause that has become decrepit and has begun to reek of stagnation. Always keep that before your eyes to encourage yourselves. Your every step now should be taken in order to bring about the collapse of everything, both the state and its moral code. Only we shall remain, we who have destined ourselves to take power; we shall join the intelligent ones to ourselves and ride roughshod over the fools. You must not be embarrassed by this. We must re-educate a generation in order to make it worthy of freedom. There are still many thousands of Shatovs in our future. We shall organize ourselves in order to seize control of the direction in which things are moving. It’s a shame not to grab hold of what is lying idle and staring open-mouthed at us. Now I’m going to go to Kirillov’s, and by morning there will be the document in which he, as he is dying, by way of explanation to the government takes it all on himself. Nothing could be more plausible than such a stratagem. In the first place, he had a falling out with Shatov: they lived together in America, and so they had time to quarrel. It’s known that Shatov changed his convictions; and enmity prompted by convictions and by fear of denunciation is the most unforgiving kind. All this will be written down just like that. Finally, keep in mind that Fedka lodged with him, in Filippov’s house. And so, all this will completely lift any suspicion from us, because it will throw all these mutton-heads off track. Tomorrow, gentlemen, we won’t see each other: I’m going off to the country for a very short time. But the day after tomorrow you will hear from me. I would advise you, as a matter of fact, to stay at home tomorrow. Just now we’ll leave in two different directions. I’ll ask you, Tolkachenko, to look after Lyamshin and take him home. You might have some influence on him and, most of all, explain the extent to which he’ll be the first to harm himself with his cowardice. Mr Virginsky, I don’t want to have any doubts about your relative Shigalyov, any more than I do about you: he won’t denounce us. All that remains is to regret his actions; still and all, he hasn’t yet announced that he’s leaving the society, and therefore it’s still too early to bury him. Well then, let’s hurry up, gentlemen. They may be mutton-heads out there, but caution still doesn’t hurt.’","""Gentlemen,"" Pyotr Stepanovich addressed them all, ""we will now disperse. You undoubtedly must feel that free pride which is attendant upon the fulfillment of a free duty. And if, unhappily, you are now too alarmed for such emotions, you will undoubtedly feel it tomorrow, by which time it would be shameful not to feel it. As for Lyamshin's all too shameful agitation, I agree to regard it as delirium, all the more so in that they say he really has been sick since morning. And you, Virginsky, one moment of free reflection will show you that, in view of the interests of the common cause, it was not possible to act upon a word of honor, but precisely as we have done. The consequences will show that there had been a denunciation. I agree to forget your exclamations. As for danger, there is none to be expected. No one will even think of suspecting any of us, especially if you yourselves know how to behave; so the main thing still depends on you yourselves and on your full conviction, which I hope will grow firm in you by tomorrow. And that, incidentally, is precisely why you united together into a separate organization of the free assembly of the like-minded, so as in the common cause to share your energy among yourselves at a given moment and, if need be, to watch over and observe each other. Each of you owes a higher accounting. You are called to renew the cause, which is decrepit and stinking from stagnation; keep that always before your eyes for encouragement. In the meantime your whole step is towards getting everything destroyed: both the state and its morality. We alone will remain, having destined ourselves beforehand to assume power: we shall rally the smart ones to ourselves, and ride on the backs of the fools. You should not be embarrassed by it. This generation must be re-educated to make it worthy of freedom. There are still many thousands of Shatovs ahead of us. We will get organized so as to seize the tendency; it is shameful not to reach out and take what is lying there idly with its mouth gaping at us. I'm now going to Kirillov, and by morning there will be a document in which he, on dying, by way of an explanation to the government, will take everything upon himself. Nothing could be more plausible than such a combination. First of all, there was enmity between him and Shatov; they lived together in America, so they had time to quarrel.

Tomorrow, gentlemen, we will not see each other; I'll be away in the district capital for a very short time. But the day after tomorrow you'll have reports from me. I would advise you, in fact, to spend tomorrow at home. We will now set out by twos on different routes. You, Tolkachenko, I ask to occupy yourself with Lyamshin and take him home. You may influence him and, above all, impress upon him the extent to which he will be harming himself first of all by his faintheartedness. Your relative Shigalyov, Mr. Virginsky, I do not wish to doubt, any more than I do you yourself: he will not denounce us. His action remains regrettable; but, all the same, he has not yet announced that he is leaving the society, so it is too early to bury him. Well-quick now, gentlemen; they may be muttonheads, but there's no harm in being prudent..."""

"Раз десять. Но он всё бежал и уже выбежал было в сени, как вдруг послышался громкий выстрел. Тут он остановился в сенях в темноте и минут пять соображал; наконец вернулся опять в комнаты. Но надо было добыть свечу. Стоило отыскать направо у шкафа на полу выбитый из рук подсвечник; но чем засветить огарок? В уме его вдруг промелькнуло одно темное воспоминание: ему припомнилось, что вчера, когда он сбежал в кухню, чтоб наброситься на Федьку, то в углу, на полке, он как будто заметил мельком большую красную коробку спичек. Ощупью направился он влево, к кухонной двери, отыскал ее, прошел сенцы и спустился по лестнице. На полке, прямо в том самом месте, которое ему сейчас припомнилось, нашарил он в темноте полную, еще не початую коробку спичек. Не зажигая огня, поспешно воротился он вверх, и только лишь около шкафа, на том самом месте, где он бил револьвером укусившего его Кириллова, вдруг вспомнил про свой укушенный палец и в то же мгновение ощутил в нем почти невыносимую боль. Стиснув зубы, он кое-как засветил огарок, вставил его опять в подсвечник и осмотрелся кругом: у окошка с отворенною форточкой, ногами в правый угол комнаты, лежал труп Кириллова. Выстрел был сделан в правый висок, и пуля вышла вверх с левой стороны, пробив череп. Виднелись брызги крови и мозга. Револьвер оставался в опустившейся на пол руке самоубийцы. Смерть должна была произойти мгновенно. Осмотрев всё со всею аккуратностью, Петр Степанович приподнялся и вышел на цыпочках, припер дверь, свечу поставил на стол в первой комнате, подумал и решил не тушить ее, сообразив, что она не может произвести пожара. Взглянув еще раз на лежавший на столе документ, он машинально усмехнулся и затем уже, всё почему-то на цыпочках, пошел из дому. Он пролез опять через Федькин ход и опять аккуратно заделал его за собою.","Times ten. But he kept running and was about to run out into the passage, when suddenly a loud shot was heard. Here he stopped in the hallway in the dark and pondered for about five minutes; finally returned to the rooms. But it was necessary to get a candle. It was worth finding a candlestick knocked out of hands by the closet on the floor to the right; but how to light the cinder? One dark memory suddenly flashed through his mind: he remembered that yesterday, when he ran into the kitchen to pounce on Fedka, in the corner, on the shelf, he seemed to catch a glimpse of a large red box of matches. He felt his way to the left, to the kitchen door, found it, went through the porch and went down the stairs. On the shelf, right in the very place that he now remembered, he found in the dark a full, not yet opened box of matches. Without lighting the fire, he hurriedly returned upward, and only near the cupboard, at the very place where he had beaten Kirillov, who had bitten him with a revolver, he suddenly remembered his bitten finger and at the same instant felt almost unbearable pain in it. Clenching his teeth, he somehow lit up the stub, put it back into the candlestick and looked around: by the window with the open window, with his feet in the right corner of the room, lay the corpse of Kirillov. The shot was made in the right temple, and the bullet went up from the left side, piercing the skull. There were splatters of blood and brains. The revolver remained in the hand of the suicide who had fallen to the floor. Death should have happened instantly. Having examined everything with all accuracy, Pyotr Stepanovich got up and went out on tiptoe, shut the door, put the candle on the table in the first room, thought about it and decided not to put it out, realizing that it could not start a fire. Glancing once more at the document lying on the table, he automatically grinned, and then, for some reason, on tiptoe, he left the house. He again climbed through the Fedkin passage and again neatly closed it behind him.","About ten times. But he kept on running and was already in the entryway when he suddenly heard a loud shot. He promptly stopped in the dark entryway and weighed matters for some five minutes; finally he went back into the rooms. But he had to find the candle. All he needed to do was search on the floor to the right of the cupboard for the candleholder that had been knocked out of his hand; but what could he light the stub with? Suddenly a vague memory flashed through his mind: he recalled that the day before, when he had run into the kitchen to attack Fedka, he seemed to have noticed in passing a large red box of matches. He felt his way to the left, towards the kitchen door, found it, crossed the landing and went down the stairway. On a shelf, precisely in the spot he had just recalled, he felt for and found in the darkness a full unopened box of matches. Without lighting one, he hurried back upstairs, and then only by the cupboard, in the same place where he had used the revolver to hit Kirillov for biting him, did he suddenly remember his bitten finger and at that very moment felt an almost unbearable pain. Gritting his teeth, he somehow lit the candle stub, stuck it in the holder again and took a look around. By the small window with the open vent lay the body of Kirillov, his feet pointing to the right-hand corner. The shot had been fired at the right temple and the bullet had exited at the top on the left side, shattering the skull. Splashes of blood and brains could be seen. The revolver remained in the suicide’s hand, which lay stretched out on the floor. Death must have occurred instantaneously. After examining all this in minute detail, Pyotr Stepanovich stood up and went out on tiptoe, left the door ajar, set the candle on the table in the first room, thought for a moment and decided not to extinguish it, figuring that it couldn’t start a fire. With another glance at the document that lay on the table, he grinned mechanically and only then, still on tiptoe for some reason, walked out of the house. He again slipped through Fedka’s passage, and again carefully closed it up behind him.","Ten times or so. But he kept running and had already reached the front hall when there suddenly came a loud shot. At that he stopped, in the front hall, in the dark, and for about five minutes stood reflecting; finally, he went back to the rooms again. But he had to get himself a candle. It would be no trouble finding the candlestick that had been knocked out of his hands on the floor to the right of the wardrobe; but what would he light the candle end with? Suddenly a dim recollection flashed through his mind: he recalled that the day before, when he ran down to the kitchen to fall upon Fedka, he seemed to have glimpsed in passing, in the corner, on a shelf, a big red box of matches. He groped his way left towards the kitchen door, found it, crossed the landing, and went down the stairs. On the shelf, right in the very spot he had just recalled, his hand came in the darkness upon a full, as yet unopened box of matches. Without striking a light, he hastily went back upstairs, and only near the wardrobe, on the very spot where he had hit Kirillov with the revolver as he was biting him, did he suddenly remember his bitten finger and in that same instant felt an almost unbearable pain in it. Clenching his teeth, he managed somehow to light the candle end, put it back in the candlestick, and looked around: near the window with the open vent, feet towards the right-hand corner of the room, lay the corpse of Kirillov.

Glancing once more at the document lying on the table, he grinned mechanically, and only then, still tiptoeing for some reason, left the house. He again got through Fedka's passage, and again carefully closed it up behind him."
