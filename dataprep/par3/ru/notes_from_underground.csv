"— Да! — резко и поспешно она мне поддакнула. Меня даже удивила поспешность этого да. Значит, и у ней, может быть, та же самая мысль бродила в голове, когда она давеча меня рассматривала? Значит, и она уже способна к некоторым мыслям?.. «Черт возьми, это любопытно, это — сродни, — думал я, — чуть не потирая себе руки. — Да и как с молодой такой душой не справиться?..»","- Yes! She urged me sharply and hastily. I was even surprised by the haste of this yes. So, maybe she had the same thought wandering in her head when she looked at me just now? So, she is already capable of some thoughts?.. “Damn it, this is curious, this is akin,” I thought, “almost rubbing my hands. “Yes, and how can one not cope with such a young soul?”","“Yes!” she agreed, abruptly and hastily. I was even surprised by the hastiness of this “yes.” So perhaps the same thought was wandering through her mind as she was peering at me just now? So she, too, is already capable of certain thoughts? . . .”Devil take it , that's curious, it's – akin” I reflected, almost rubbing my hands. ”No, how can I fail to get the better of such a young soul? . . .”","‘Yes!’ she agreed sharply and quickly. I was astonished by the swiftness of that yes…. So the same thought had perhaps been running through her head too, a short time before, when she was watching me? So even she was capable of some ideas?… ‘Damn it, how very interesting that we should be akin!’ I thought, almost rubbing my hands. But how with a young heart like this could she fail to understand?","“Yes!” she assented sharply and hurriedly. I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this “Yes.” So the same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at me just before. So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts? “Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!” I thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it’s easy to turn a young soul like that!"
"— Да что ты, чего дерешься? — закричал мужичонка, стегая, однако ж, клячу, так что та начала лягаться задними ногами.","“Yes, what are you fighting about?” the little man shouted, whipping, however, the nag, so that she began to kick with her hind legs.","“What's with you? Why're you punching?” the little peasant cried, lashing the nag, however, so that she started kicking with her hind legs.","‘What’s that for, why are you knocking me about?’ cried my wretched peasant, but he whipped up his miserable nag, so that it began to lash out with its hoofs.","“What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?” the peasant shouted, but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking."

"Я пил с горя лафит и херес стаканами. С непривычки быстро хмелел, а с хмелем росла и досада. Мне вдруг захотелось оскорбить их всех самым дерзким образом и потом уж уйти. Улучить минуту и показать себя — пусть же скажут: хоть и смешон, да умен… и… и… одним словом, черт с ними!","I drank lafite and sherry with glasses of grief. Out of habit, I quickly got tipsy, and with the hops my annoyance grew. I suddenly wanted to insult them all in the most daring way and then leave. To seize a moment and show themselves - let them say: although he is ridiculous, he is smart ... and ... and ... in a word, to hell with them!","I drank Lafite and sherry by the glassful in my grief. From lack of habit I was quickly getting drunk, and as my drunkenness increased, so did my vexation. I suddenly wanted to insult them all in the boldest fashion, and only then leave. To seize the right moment and show myself; let them say: he's funny, but no dummy . . . and . . . and . . . in short, devil take them.","I drowned my sorrows in great bumpers of claret and sherry. I was so unused to it that I got drunk very quickly, and my anger increased with my intoxication. Suddenly I wanted to be outrageously rude to every one of them, and then go. To find the right moment and show them who I was: make them say, ‘He may be ridiculous, but he’s damned clever…’ and… and… in short, to hell with them!","I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my discomfiture. Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My annoyance increased as the wine went to my head. I longed all at once to insult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To seize the moment and show what I could do, so that they would say, “He’s clever, though he is absurd,” and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!"
"— Гм… — решаете вы, — наши хотенья большею частию бывают ошибочны от ошибочного взгляда на наши выгоды. Мы потому и хотим иногда чистого вздору, что в этом вздоре видим, по глупости нашей, легчайшую дорогу к достижению какой-нибудь заранее предположенной выгоды. Ну, а когда все это будет растолковано, расчислено на бумажке (что очень возможно, потому что гнусно же и бессмысленно заранее верить, что иных законов природы человек никогда не узнает), то тогда, разумеется, не будет так называемых желаний. Ведь если хотенье стакнется когда-нибудь совершенно с рассудком, так ведь уж мы будем тогда рассуждать, а не хотеть собственно потому, что ведь нельзя же, например, сохраняя рассудок, хотеть бессмыслицы и таким образом зазнамо идти против рассудка и желать себе вредного… А так как все хотенья и рассуждения могут быть действительно вычислены, потому что когда-нибудь откроют же законы так называемой нашей свободной воли, то, стало быть, и, кроме шуток, может устроиться что-нибудь вроде таблички, так что мы и действительно хотеть будем по этой табличке. Ведь если мне, например, когда-нибудь, расчислят и докажут, что если я показал такому-то кукиш, так именно потому, что не мог не показать и что непременно таким-то пальцем должен был его показать, так что же тогда во мне свободного-то останется, особенно если я ученый и где-нибудь курс наук кончил? Ведь я тогда вперед всю мою жизнь на тридцать лет рассчитать могу; одним словом, если и устроится это, так ведь нам уж нечего будет делать; все равно надо будет принять. Да и вообще мы должны, не уставая, повторять себе, что непременно в такую-то минуту и в таких-то обстоятельствах природа нас не спрашивается; что нужно принимать ее так, как она есть, а не так, как мы фантазируем, и если мы действительно стремимся к табличке и к календарю, ну, и… ну хоть бы даже и к реторте, то что же делать, надо принять и реторту! не то она сама, без вас примется…","“Hm,” you decide, “our desires are mostly erroneous from an erroneous view of our benefits. That is why we sometimes want pure nonsense, because in this nonsense we see, due to our stupidity, the easiest way to achieve some preconceived advantage. Well, when all this is explained, calculated on a piece of paper (which is very possible, because it is vile and senseless to believe in advance that a person will never know other laws of nature), then, of course, there will be no so-called desires. After all, if wanting ever completely collides with reason, then we will then reason, and not actually want because, after all, it is impossible, for example, while maintaining reason, to want nonsense and thus deliberately go against reason and wish for ourselves harmful ... And since all desires and reasoning can really be calculated, because someday the laws of our so-called free will will be discovered, then, therefore, and, apart from jokes, something like a tablet can be arranged, so that we really will want on this plate. After all, if, for example, someday they calculate and prove to me that if I showed such and such a fico, it was precisely because I could not help but show it and that I had to show it with such and such a finger, so what then in me Will there be anything free, especially if I am a scientist and finished my science course somewhere? After all, then I can calculate my whole life for thirty years ahead; in a word, even if this is arranged, then we will have nothing to do; still need to be accepted. And in general, we must tirelessly repeat to ourselves that at such and such a moment and in such and such circumstances, nature does not ask us; that it is necessary to accept it as it is, and not as we fantasize, and if we really strive for a tablet and a calendar, well, and ... well, even if only for a retort, then what can we do, we must accept the retort ! not that she herself, without you, will be accepted ...","“Hm . . .” you decide, “our wantings are for the most part mistaken owing to a mistaken view of our profit. We sometimes want pure rubbish precisely because, in our stupidity, we see this rubbish as the easiest path to the attainment of some preconceived profit. Well, but when it's all explained, worked out on a piece of paper (which is quite possible because, after all, it's vile and senseless to believe beforehand that there are certain laws of nature which man will never learn) – then, to be sure, there will be no more so-called desires. For if wanting someday gets completely in cahoots with reason, then essentially we shall be reasoning and not wanting, because it really is impossible, for example, while preserving reason, to want senselessness and thus knowingly go against reason and wish yourself harm . . . And since all wantings and reasonings can indeed be calculated – because, after all, they will someday discover the laws of our so-called free will – then consequently, and joking aside, something like a little table can be arranged, so that we shall indeed want according to this little table. For if it should someday be worked out and proved to me that when I made a fig at such-and-such a person, it was precisely because I could not do otherwise, and that I was bound to do it with such-and-such a finger, then what is left so free in me, especially if I am a learned man and have completed a course of studies somewhere? No, then I can calculate my life for thirty years ahead; in short, if this does get arranged, then we really will have no choice; we'll have to accept it in any case. And, generally, we ought tirelessly to repeat to ourselves that, precisely at such-and-such a moment, in such-and-such circumstances, nature does not ask our permission; that it must be accepted as it is, and not as we fancy, and if we are really aiming at a little table and a calendar, and . . . well, and even at a retort, then there's no help for it, we must accept the retort! Or else it will get accepted of itself, without you . . .”","‘H’m,’ you decide, ‘our desires are for the most part mistaken because of our erroneous view of our own interests. The reason why we sometimes want purely nonsensical things is that in our stupidity we see in those nonsensical things the easiest way to the attainment of some already proposed advantage. Well, but when it has all been worked out and tabulated on paper (which is quite possible, because it is wicked and silly to believe in advance that there are some laws of nature that man will never discover), then of course there will no longer be any so-called volition. If ever volition becomes completely identified with common sense, we shall of course reason, not want, purely because it is impossible to want what has no sense, flying in the face of reason and desiring what will do one harm, and still preserve one’s common sense…. And since all volition and all reasoning really may be tabulated, because the laws of our so-called free will may indeed be discovered, it follows, quite seriously, that some sort of table may be drawn up and that we shall exercise our wills in conformity with that table. If, for example, it can one day be worked out and proved to me that I have on some occasion cocked a snook at somebody simply because I could not help it, and that I was obliged to make the gesture in that particular way, then what freedom remains to me, especially if I am learned and have taken a science course somewhere? After all, in that case I can calculate my life for thirty years in advance; in short, if things turn out in this way, there won’t be anything left for us to do; all the same, we shall need to understand. But in general we ought always to be telling ourselves that, inevitably, at certain times and in certain circumstances nature will not consult us; that we must take her as she is and not as we fancy her to be, and if we really are progressing at great speed towards the tables and almanacs and… even the test-tube, there’s no help for it, we must accept even the test-tube! Or else it will be accepted for us…’","“H’m!” you decide. “Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of our advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to be senseless in our desires, and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning can be really calculated—because there will some day be discovered the laws of our so-called free will— so, joking apart, there may one day be something like a table constructed of them, so that we really shall choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular way, what freedom is left me, especially if I am a learned man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the chemical retort, there’s no help for it , we must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted without our consent....”"

"Я вложил в письмо шесть рублей, запечатал и упросил Аполлона снести к Симонову. Узнав, что в письме деньги, Аполлон стал почтительнее и согласился сходить. К вечеру я вышел пройтись. Голова у меня еще болела и кружилась со вчерашнего. Но чем более наступал вечер и чем гуще становились сумерки, тем более менялись и путались мои впечатления, а за ними и мысли. Что-то не умирало во мне внутри, в глубине сердца и совести, не хотело умереть и сказывалось жгучей тоской. Толкался я больше по самым людным, промышленным улицам, по Мещанским, по Садовой, у Юсупова сада. Особенно любил я всегда прохаживаться по этим улицам в сумерки, именно когда там густеет толпа всякого прохожего, промышленного и ремесленного люду, с озабоченными до злости лицами, расходящаяся по домам с дневных заработков. Нравилась мне именно эта грошовая суетня, эта наглая прозаичность. В этот раз вся эта уличная толкотня еще больше меня раздражала. Я никак не мог с собой справиться, концов найти. Что-то подымалось, подымалось в душе беспрерывно, с болью, и не хотело угомониться. Совсем расстроенный я воротился домой. Точно как будто на душе моей лежало какое-то преступление.","I put six rubles into the letter, sealed it, and begged Apollo to take it to Simonov.

But the more evening came and the thicker the twilight became, the more my impressions changed and became confused, and after them my thoughts. Something didn't die inside of me, in the depths of my heart and conscience, didn't want to die and was expressed by a burning longing. I pushed more along the most crowded, industrial streets, along Meshchansky, along Sadovaya, near Yusupov Garden. I especially liked to walk along these streets at dusk, precisely when a crowd of all kinds of passers-by, industrial and artisan people, with faces preoccupied to anger, dispersing home from daily earnings, thickens there. I liked this penny fuss, this impudent prosaicness. This time, all this street hustle and bustle annoyed me even more. I could not cope with myself, to find the ends.

But the more evening advanced and the twilight thickened, the more my impressions and, after them, my thoughts as well, kept changing and tangling. Something within me, deep in my heart and conscience, would not die, refused to die, and betrayed itself in a burning anguish. I loitered about mainly on the most crowded business streets – Meshchanskaya, Sadovaya, around the Yusupov Garden. I had always liked especially to stroll along those streets at twilight, precisely when the crowd thickens with all sorts of passers-by, merchants, and tradesmen, their faces preoccupied to the point of anger, going home from their daily work. I precisely liked this twopenny bustle, this insolent prosiness. But now all this street jostling only irritated me the more. I simply could not get hold of myself, could not find the loose ends.

I had always been especially fond of strolling through those streets at dusk, just when the passing crowds of craftsmen and factory-workers going home from their day’s work, their faces bad-tempered with worry, were at their thickest. This anxious preoccupation with farthings, this undisguised prose, was what particularly appealed to me. This time the jostling crush in the streets only inflamed my nerves still more. I simply couldn’t get myself straightened out. Something was working and seething in my soul, incessantly and painfully. I returned home utterly shattered.

"Всех наших канцелярских я, разумеется, ненавидел, с первого до последнего, и всех презирал, а вместе с тем как будто их и боялся. Случалось, что я вдруг даже ставил их выше себя. У меня как-то это вдруг тогда делалось: то презираю, то ставлю выше себя. Развитой и порядочный человек не может быть тщеславен без неограниченной требовательности к себе самому и не презирая себя в иные минуты до ненависти. Но, презирая ли, ставя ли выше, я чуть не перед каждым встречным опускал глаза. Я даже опыты делал: стерплю ли я взгляд вот хоть такого-то на себе, и всегда опускал я первый. Это меня мучило до бешенства. До болезни тоже боялся я быть смешным и потому рабски обожал рутину во всем, что касалось наружного; с любовью вдавался в общую колею и всей душою пугался в себе всякой эксцентричности. Но где мне было выдержать? Я был болезненно развит, как и следует быть развитым человеку нашего времени. Они же все были тупы и один на другого похожи как бараны в стаде. Может быть, только мне одному во всей канцелярии постоянно казалось, что я был трус и раб; именно потому и казалось, что я был развит. Но оно не только казалось, а и действительно так было в самом деле: я был трус и раб. Говорю это без всякого конфуза. Всякий порядочный человек нашего времени есть и должен быть трус и раб. Это нормальное его состояние. В этом я убежден глубоко. Он так сделан и на то устроен. И не в настоящее время, от каких-нибудь там случайных обстоятельств, а вообще во все времена порядочный человек должен быть трус и раб. Это закон природы всех порядочных людей на земле. Если и случится кому из них похрабриться над чем-нибудь, то пусть этим не утешается и не увлекается: все равно перед другим сбрендит. Таков единственный и вековечный выход. Храбрятся только ослы и их ублюдки, но ведь и те до известной стены. На них и внимания обращать не стоит, потому что они ровно ничего не означают.","Of course, I hated all our office workers, from the first to the last, and despised them all, and at the same time I seemed to be afraid of them. It happened that I suddenly even put them above myself. I somehow suddenly did it then: either I despise it, or I put it above myself. A developed and decent person cannot be conceited without unlimited demands on himself and without despising himself at other times to the point of hatred. But, whether despising, or putting it higher, I lowered my eyes to almost everyone I met. I even made experiments: can I endure the look of at least such and such on myself, and I always omitted the first one. This tortured me to the point of madness. Before my illness, too, I was afraid of being ridiculous, and therefore slavishly adored routine in everything that concerned the outside; lovingly fell into the general rut and with all his soul was afraid of any eccentricity in himself. But where was I to endure? I was morbidly developed, as a man of our time should be developed. They were all stupid and looked like one another like sheep in a herd. Perhaps it was only to me alone in the whole office that it constantly seemed that I was a coward and a slave; that is why it seemed that I was developed. But it not only seemed so, but actually it really was: I was a coward and a slave. I say this without any embarrassment. Every decent person of our time is and must be a coward and a slave. This is his normal state. Of this I am deeply convinced. It's how it's made and designed. And not at the present time, from some random circumstances, but in general at all times a decent person should be a coward and a slave. This is the law of nature of all decent people on earth. If one of them happens to be brave over something, then let it not be comforted and not carried away: it will still make a fool of itself in front of the other. This is the only and eternal way out. Only donkeys and their bastards are brave, but even those are up to a certain wall. You should not pay attention to them, because they mean absolutely nothing.","Of course, I hated them all in our office, from first to last, and despised them all, but at the same time I was also as if afraid of them. It happened that I would suddenly set them above myself. Things were somehow sudden with me in those days: now I despised them, now I set them above me. A developed and decent man cannot be vain without a boundless exactingness towards himself and without despising himself at moments to the point of hatred. But whether I despised them or set them above me, I used to drop my eyes before almost everyone I met. I even made experiments: will I be able to endure so-and-so's glance on me? – and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This tormented me to the point of fury. I was also afraid to the point of illness of being ridiculous, and therefore slavishly worshiped routine in everything to do with externals; I loved falling into the common rut, and feared any eccentricity in myself with all my soul. But how could I hold out? I was morbidly developed, as a man of our time ought to be developed. And they were all dull-witted and as like one another as a flock of sheep. Perhaps to me alone in the whole office did it constantly seem that I was a coward and a slave; it seemed so to me precisely because I was developed. But it not only seemed, in fact it really was so: I was a coward and a slave. I say it without any embarrassment. Every decent man of our time is and must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. I am deeply convinced of it. He's made that way, and arranged for it. And not in the present time, owing to some sort of chance circumstances, but generally in all times a decent man must be a coward and a slave. That is the natural law of all decent people on earth. If one of them does happen to get up a bit of pluck in something, let him not be eased or pleased by that: he'll still quail before something else. Such is the sole and everlasting outcome. Only asses and their mongrels show pluck, and even then only up to that certain wall. It's not worth paying any attention to them, because they mean precisely nothing.","Needless to say, I hated all the members of my department from the first to the last, and despised them, and yet somehow feared them as well. At times I would even rate them above myself. This quite often happened to me at that time; at one moment I despised them, at the next I felt they were superior to me. A decent and intelligent man cannot be vain without making inordinate demands on himself and at times despising himself to the point of hatred. But whether I despised them or rated them above myself, I dropped my eyes before almost everybody I came across. I even tried experiments: ‘Shall I be able to bear so-and-so’s eyes upon me?’ – and I was always the first to lower my eyes. This drove me to frenzy. I was also morbidly afraid of being ridiculous and therefore slavishly observed the ordinary conventions in every outward appearance; I enthusiastically followed the common rut and was terrified of developing any eccentricity. But how was I to keep it up? I was painfully advanced, as a man of our time should be. But they were dullards, as like one another as a flock of sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the whole office who always seemed to myself a slave and a coward precisely because I also seemed (to myself) civilized. But I not only seemed, I really was a coward and a slave. I say this without shame. Every decent man in this age is, and must be, a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. I am profoundly certain of this. That is how he is made and what he was made for. And not only at the present time, because of what may be accidental circumstances, but at all times, a decent man must be a coward and a slave. This is a law of the nature of all decent people on the earth. Even if one of them puts on a show of bravery before somebody else, he ought not to take comfort from that or let himself be carried away by it: he is only showing off to the other person. This is the only and the eternal solution. Only donkeys and mules make a show of bravery, and they only to a limited extent. It is not worth while paying any attention to them, because they count for exactly nothing.","Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every time I met anyone. I even made experiments whether I could face so and so’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly developed. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I was a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them happens to be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no consequence."
"— Гм… да. Может быть. Опять и то, Лиза: человек только свое горе любит считать, а счастья своего не считает. А счел бы как должно, так и увидел бы, что на всякую долю его запасено. Ну, а что, коли в семье все удастся, бог благословит, муж выйдет хороший, любит тебя, лелеет тебя, не отходит от тебя! хорошо в той семье! Даже иной раз и с горем пополам хорошо; да и где горя нет? Выйдешь, может, замуж, сама узнаешь. Зато взять хоть в первое-то время замужем за тем, кого любишь: счастья-то, счастья-то сколько иной раз придет! да и сплошь да рядом. В первое-то время даже и ссоры с мужем хорошо кончаются. Иная сама чем больше любит, тем больше ссоры с мужем заваривает. Право; я знал такую: «Так вот, люблю, дескать, очень и из любви тебя мучаю, а ты чувствуй». Знаешь ли, что из любви нарочно человека можно мучить? Все больше женщины. А сама про себя думает: «Зато уж так буду потом любить, так заласкаю, что не грех теперь и помучить». И в доме все на вас радуются, и хорошо, и весело, и мирно, и честно… Вот другие тоже ревнивы бывают. Уйдет он куда, — я знал одну, — не стерпит, да в самую ночь и выскочит, да и бежит потихоньку смотреть: не там ли, не в том ли доме, не с той ли? Это уж худо. И сама знает, что худо, и сердце у ней замирает и казнится, да ведь любит; все от любви. А как хорошо после ссоры помириться, самой перед ним повиниться али простить! И так хорошо обоим, так хорошо вдруг станет, — точно вновь они встретились, вновь повенчались, вновь любовь у них началась. И никто-то, никто-то не должен знать, что между мужем и женой происходит, коль они любят друг друга. И какая бы ни вышла у них ссора, мать родную, и ту не должны себе в судьи звать и один про другого рассказывать. Сами они себе судьи. Любовь — тайна божия и от всех глаз чужих должна быть закрыта, что бы там ни произошло. Святее от этого, лучше. Друг друга больше уважают, а на уважении много основано. И коль раз уж была любовь, коль по любви венчались, зачем любви проходить! Неужто нельзя ее поддержать? Редко такой случай, что нельзя поддержать. Ну, а как муж человек добрый и честный удастся, так как тут любовь пройдет? Первая брачная любовь пройдет, правда, а там придет любовь еще лучше. Там душой сойдутся, все дела свои сообща положут; тайны друг от друга не будет. А дети пойдут, так тут каждое, хоть и самое трудное время счастьем покажется; только бы любить да быть мужественным. Тут и работа весела, тут и в хлебе себе иной раз отказываешь для детей, и то весело. Ведь они ж тебя будут за это потом любить; себе же, значит, копишь. Дети растут, чувствуешь, что ты им пример, что ты им поддержка; что и умрешь ты, они всю жизнь чувства и мысли твои будут носить на себе, так как от тебя получили, твой образ и подобие примут. Значит, это великий долг. Как тут не сойтись тесней отцу с матерью? Говорят вот, детей иметь тяжело? Кто это говорит? Это счастье небесное! Любишь ты маленьких детей, Лиза? я ужасно люблю. Знаешь — розовенький такой мальчик, грудь тебе сосет, да у какого мужа сердце повернется на жену, глядя, как она с его ребенком сидит! Ребеночек розовенький, пухленький, раскинется, нежится; ножки-ручки наливные, ноготочки чистенькие, маленькие, такие маленькие, что глядеть смешно, глазки, точно уж он все понимает. А сосет — грудь тебе ручонкой теребит, играет. Отец подойдет, оторвется от груди, перегнется весь назад, посмотрит на отца, засмеется, — точно уж и бог знает как смешно, — и опять, опять сосать примется. А то возьмет, да и прикусит матери грудь, коль уж зубки прорезываются, а сам глазенками-то косит на нее: «Видишь, прикусил!» Да разве не все тут счастье, когда они трое, муж, жена и ребенок, вместе? За эти минуты много можно простить. Нет, Лиза, знать самому сначала нужно жить выучиться, а потом уж других обвинять!","“Um… yes. May be. Again and again, Liza: a man only likes to count his grief, but does not count his own happiness. And he would have counted as it should, and he would have seen that he was stocked for every share. Well, what if everything in the family succeeds, God bless, the husband will come out good, loves you, cherishes you, does not leave you! well in that family! Even sometimes and with grief in half it’s good; and where is there no grief? You'll get married, maybe you'll find out for yourself. But take at least for the first time married to the one you love: happiness, happiness, how many times will come! yes, and all the way around. At first, even quarrels with her husband end well. Another herself, the more she loves, the more quarrels with her husband she brews. Right; I knew this: “So, I love, they say, I torture you very much and out of love, but you feel it.” Do you know that out of love you can torture a person on purpose? More and more women. And she thinks to herself: “But then I’ll love it so much, I’ll caress it so much that now it’s not a sin to torment me.” And in the house everyone rejoices at you, and it’s good, and fun, and peaceful, and honest ... Others are also jealous. He’ll go somewhere, I knew one, he won’t endure, and he will jump out into the very night, and he will run slowly to look: is it not there, not in that house, not with that one? It's too bad. And she herself knows that it is bad, and her heart stops and is executed, but she loves; everything is from love. And how good it is to reconcile after a quarrel, to obey him herself or to forgive! And it’s so good for both of them, it will suddenly become so good - it’s as if they met again, got married again, their love began again. And no one, no one should know what is happening between husband and wife, since they love each other. And no matter what kind of quarrel they have, their own mother, and that one should not be called a judge and tell one about the other. They are their own judges. Love is the secret of God and must be closed from all the eyes of strangers, no matter what happens there. The holier of it, the better. They respect each other more, and a lot is based on respect. And since there was love, since they were married for love, why should love pass! Can't you support her? Rarely is a case that cannot be supported. Well, how will a good and honest man succeed, since love will pass here? The first marital love will pass, however, and there will come love even better. There they will converge in soul, put all their affairs together; there will be no secrets from each other. And the children will go, so here everyone, even the most difficult time, will seem like happiness; just to love and be courageous. Here the work is cheerful, here and sometimes you refuse bread for your children, and that is fun. After all, they will love you for it later; to yourself, then, you save. Children grow up, you feel that you are an example to them, that you are their support; that you die, they will carry your feelings and thoughts all their lives, since they received from you, they will accept your image and likeness. So this is a big debt. How can a father and mother not get closer together? They say it's hard to have children? Who is speaking? This is heavenly happiness! Do you like little children, Lisa? I love terribly. You know - such a pink boy, sucks your breasts, but what husband's heart will turn to his wife, looking at how she sits with his child! The baby is pink, plump, spread out, basking; the legs-handles are solid, the nails are clean, small, so small that it looks funny, the eyes, as if he understands everything. And sucks - your chest is pulled with a hand, plays. Father will come up, tear himself away from his chest, bend over backwards, look at his father, laugh—God knows how funny it is—and again, again, he will begin to suck. And then he will take it, and bite his mother’s chest, since the teeth are already erupting, and he squints at her with his little eyes: “You see, he bit him!” Isn't it all happiness when the three of them, husband, wife and child, are together? A lot can be forgiven in these minutes. No, Liza, to know yourself first you need to learn how to live, and then blame others!","“Hm . . . yes. Perhaps. Then there's this, Liza: man only likes counting his grief, he doesn't count his happiness. But if he were to count properly, he'd see that there's enough of both lots for him. Well, and what if everything goes right in the family, God blesses it, your husband turns out to be a good man, who loves you, pampers you, never leaves your side! It's good in this family! Oftentimes even half mixed with grief it's still good; and where is there no grief? Perhaps, once you get married, you'll find out for yourself. But take just the beginning, after you've married someone you love: there's such happiness at times, so much happiness! I mean, day in and day out. In the beginning, even quarrels with a husband end well. Some women, the more they love, the more they pick quarrels with their husbands. It's true; I knew such a woman: 'You see,' she all but said, 'I love you very much, and torment you out of love, and you ought to feel it.' Do you know that one can deliberately torment a person out of love? Women, mainly. And she thinks to herself: ' But afterwards I'll love him so much for it, I'll caress him so, that it's no sin to torment him a bit now.' And at home everyone rejoices over you, and it's good, and cheery, and peaceful, and honest . . . Then, too, there's the jealous sort. He goes out somewhere – I knew one like this – she can't help herself, she jumps out at night and runs on the sly to see: is he there, is he in that house, is he with that woman? Now, that is bad. And she knows herself that it's bad, and her heart is sinking, and she blames herself, and yet she loves him; it's all from love. And how good to make peace after a quarrel, to own up to him, or to forgive! And how good, how good they both suddenly feel – as if they were meeting anew, getting married anew, beginning to love anew. And no one, no one ought to know what goes on between a husband and wife if they love each other. And whatever quarrel they may have – they shouldn't call even their mother to be their judge or hear them tell about each other. They are their own judges. Love – is God's mystery, and should be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. It's holier that way, and better. They respect each other more, and so much is founded on respect. And if there was love once, if they were married out of love, why should love pass? Can't it be sustained? It rarely happens that it can't be. Well, and if the husband proves to be a kind and honest man, how can love pass? The first married love will pass, true, but then an even better love will come. Then their souls will grow close; they'll decide all their doings together; they'll have no secrets from each other. And when children arrive, then all of it, even the hardest times, will look like happiness; one need only love and have courage. Now even work brings joy, now even if you must occasionally deny yourself bread for the children's sake, still there is joy. For they will love you for it later; so you're laying aside for yourself. The children are growing – you feel you're an example to them, a support for them; that even when you die, they'll bear your thoughts and feelings upon themselves as they received them from you, they'll take on your image and likeness.[39] So it is a great duty. How can a father and mother fail to grow closer? People say it's hard having children. Who says so? It's a heavenly happiness! Do you love little children, Liza? I love them terribly. You know – there's this rosy little boy sucking at your breast, now what husband's heart could turn against his wife, looking at her sitting with his child! The baby is rosy, plump, pampered, sprawling; his little hands and feet are pudgy; his nails are so clean and small, so small it's funny to see; his eyes seem to understand everything already. He's sucking and clutching at your breast with his little hand, playing. The father comes up – he'll tear himself away from the breast, bend back, look at his father, laughing – as if it really were God knows how funny – and then again, again start sucking. Or else he'll up and bite his mother's breast , if he's already cutting teeth, while giving her a sidelong look: 'See how I bit you!' Isn't this the whole of happiness, when they're all three together, husband, wife, and child? A lot can be forgiven for those moments. No, Liza, one must first learn how to live, and only then accuse others!”","‘H’m… yes. Perhaps. There’s another thing, Liza: people only like to count their sorrows, they don’t count their happinesses. But if they reckoned as they ought to, they would see that everybody gets his share of everything. Well, but suppose everything goes well with your family, God is good to you, your husband proves to be a good man who loves you and cherishes you and doesn’t leave you! It would be happy in a family like that. Sometimes, even, it’s happy with half joy and half sorrow; and besides there’s some sorrow everywhere. Perhaps you’ll get married, and then you’ll find out for yourself. On the other hand, take the early days of being married to a man you love: what utter happiness that can be! And it is renewed again and again. To begin with, even quarrels with a husband end happily. Sometimes the more a woman loves her husband, the more quarrels she starts with him. It’s true; I knew one like that: “It’s like this: I love you very much,” she’d say, “and I torment you out of love, and I want you to feel that.” Do you know that you can deliberately torment somebody out of love? Especially women can. And they think to themselves, “Afterwards I’ll be so loving and tender that it’s not wrong to make him suffer now.” – And at home everybody is glad of you, there is goodness and merriment and peace and decency…. And there are others who are jealous. I knew one – if her husband was out she couldn’t rest, even in the middle of the night she’d get up and go poking and prying to see if he was there, in that house, with that woman. That’s really bad. And she knew it was bad, and her heart would be heavy, and she would reproach herself, but it was because she loved him, you know; all for love. And how good it is to make it up after a quarrel, and ask his forgiveness and forgive him! And both of them are so happy, everything suddenly becomes wonderful – as if they had just met for the first time, or got married, or fallen in love. And nobody, nobody at all, ought to know what goes on between man and wife, if they love each other. And whatever sort of quarrels they have – they mustn’t even call their own mothers in as judges, with one telling tales about the other. They are their own judges. Love is a sacred secret, and ought to be kept hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. It is holier that way, and better. They respect one another more, and respect is the foundation of many things. And if there was once love, if they married for love, why should love ever come to an end? Is it really impossible to keep it up? It very rarely happens that it can’t be kept going. Why, if a husband is a good and honest man, and gets on in life, how can love pass away? The first wedded love passes, true, but then comes an even better love. Then the two come together in soul and have all things in common; they have no secrets from one another. And when children come, even the most difficult of times will seem happiness; one need only love and have courage. Then work itself is cheerful, and even if you have to deny yourself food for the children, that is cheerful too. They will love you for it afterwards, it really means laying up a store for yourselves: when the children are growing you feel you must be an example and a support for them; and that even if you die, they will carry your feelings and thoughts in themselves all their lives, since they have received them from you and will bear your image and likeness. This then is a great duty. How can it fail to draw father and mother even closer together? Is it supposed to be a heavy burden to have children? Who says so? It is heavenly bliss! Do you like little children, Liza? I do, terribly. You know – a rosy little baby sucking at your breast, and any husband’s heart will turn towards his wife when he sees her sitting with his baby in her arms! A rosy, chubby little child, stretching and sunning itself; plump little legs and arms, transparent little nails, so tiny that you laugh to see them, and little eyes that seem to understand everything already. And it sucks, its tiny hand pinching and playing with your breast. The father comes near; it tears itself away from the breast, bends over backwards and looks at its father, laughs – as if something was terribly funny – and then applies itself to sucking again. Or else all of a sudden, if its little teeth are coming through, it bites its mother’s breast, looking slyly out of the corners of its little eyes as if to say, “Look, I bit it!” And isn’t that the whole of happiness, when the three, husband, wife, and child are together? Much can be forgiven for those moments. Yes, indeed, Liza, you have to learn how to live yourself, and after that you can criticize people!’","“H’m ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry you will find out for yourself. But think of the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it’s the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one’s husband end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them. Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves ‘I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it’s no sin to torment him a little now.’ And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women who are jealous. If he went off anywhere—I knew one such woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That’s a pity. And the woman knows herself it’s wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she loves— it’s all through love. And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once—as though they had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer? People say it’s a trial to have children. Who says that? It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know—a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother’s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, ‘Look, I am biting!’ Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one blames others!”"
"Наконец на моих дрянных стенных часишках прошипело пять. Я схватил шапку и, стараясь не взглянуть на Аполлона, — который еще с утра все ждал от меня выдачи жалованья, но по гордости своей не хотел заговорить первый, — скользнул мимо него из дверей и на лихаче, которого нарочно нанял за последний полтинник, подкатил барином к Hôtel de Paris.","Finally, my wretched wall cup hissed five. I grabbed my hat and, trying not to look at Apollo—who had been expecting me to give me a salary since morning, but due to his pride did not want to speak first—slid past him out of the door and in a scorcher, whom I had purposely hired for the last fifty kopecks, drove up gentleman to the Hôtel de Paris.","At last my wretched little wall clock hissed five. I grabbed my hat and, trying not to glance at Apollon – who since morning had been waiting to receive his wages from me, but in his pride refused to speak first – slipped past him out the door, and in a coach hired for the purpose with my last fifty kopecks, drove up like a grand gentleman to the Hotel de Paris.","At long last the cheap clock on the wall wheezed out five o’clock. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been waiting for me to pay him his wages ever since the morning, but was pig-headedly determined not to mention the matter first, slipped past him to the door and drove to the Hotel de Paris like a lord, in a cab I hired for my last fifty copecks.","At last my wretched little clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month’s wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hôtel de Paris."

"— Почему же-с? Я ведь, кажется, тоже товарищ, и, признаюсь, мне даже обидно, что меня обошли, — заклокотал было я опять.","- Why, sir? After all, it seems that I am also a comrade, and, I confess, I am even offended that I was passed over, ”I began to gurgle again.","“What of it, sir? I would seem to be a schoolfellow, too, and I confess I'm even offended at being left out,” I began seething again.","‘Why not? I was at school with him too, I think, and I confess I am hurt at being left out,’ I began to storm.","“Why not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must own I feel hurt that you have left me out,” I said, boiling over again."

Она ушла. Я воротился в комнату в раздумье. Ужасно тяжело мне было.,She left. I returned to the room in thought. It was terribly hard for me.,"She was gone. I went back to my room, pondering. I felt terribly heavy.",She had gone. I went back irresolutely into the room. I felt utterly wretched.,She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly oppressed.
"Недостающую же и весьма для меня значительную сумму решился выпросить взаймы у Антона Антоныча Сеточкина, моего столоначальника, человека смиренного, но серьезного и положительного, никому не дававшего взаймы денег, но которому я был когда-то, при вступлении в должность, особенно рекомендован определившим меня на службу значительным лицом. Мучился я ужасно. Попросить денег у Антона Антоныча мне казалось чудовищным и постыдным. Я даже две-три ночи не спал, да и вообще я тогда мало спал, был в лихорадке; сердце у меня как-то смутно замирало или вдруг начинало прыгать, прыгать, прыгать!.. Антон Антонович сначала удивился, потом поморщился, потом рассудил и все-таки дал взаймы, взяв с меня расписку на право получения данных заимообразно денег через две недели из жалованья. Таким образом, все было наконец готово; красивый бобрик воцарился на месте паскудного енота, и я начал помаленьку приступать к делу. Нельзя же было решиться с первого разу, зря; надо было это дело обделать умеючи, именно помаленьку. Но признаюсь, что после многократных попыток я даже было начал отчаиваться: не состукиваемся никак — да и только! Уж я ль приготовлялся, я ль не намеревался, — кажется, вот-вот сейчас состукнемся, смотрю — и опять я уступил дорогу, а он и прошел, не заметив меня. Я даже молитвы читал, подходя к нему, чтоб бог вселил в меня решимость. Один раз я было и совсем уже решился, но кончилось тем, что только попал ему под ноги, потому что в самое последнее мгновение, на двухвершковом каком-нибудь расстоянии, не хватило духу. Он преспокойно прошел по мне, и я, как мячик, отлетел в сторону. В эту ночь я был опять болен в лихорадке и бредил. И вдруг все закончилось как нельзя лучше. Накануне ночью я окончательно положил не исполнять моего пагубного намерения и все оставить втуне и с этою целью в последний раз я вышел на Невский, чтобы только так посмотреть, — как это я оставлю все это втуне? Вдруг, в трех шагах от врага моего, я неожиданно решился, зажмурил глаза и — мы плотно стукнулись плечо о плечо! Я не уступил ни вершка и прошел мимо совершенно на равной ноге! Он даже и не оглянулся и сделал вид, что не заметил; но он только вид сделал, я уверен в этом. Я до сих пор в этом уверен! Разумеется, мне досталось больше; он был сильнее, но не в том было дело. Дело было в том, что я достиг цели, поддержал достоинство, не уступил ни на шаг и публично поставил себя с ним на равной социальной ноге. Воротился я домой совершенно отмщенный за все. Я был в восторге. Я торжествовал и пел итальянские арии. Разумеется, я вам не буду описывать того, что произошло со мной через три дня; если читали мою первую главу «Подполье», то можете сами догадаться. Офицера потом куда-то перевели; лет уже четырнадцать я его теперь не видал. Что-то он теперь, мой голубчик? Кого давит?","I decided to borrow the missing and very significant amount for me from Anton Antonych Setochkin, my head clerk, a humble, but serious and positive man, who did not lend money to anyone, but to whom I was once, upon taking office, was especially recommended by those who determined me to the service of a significant person. I suffered terribly. To ask Anton Antonych for money seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I didn’t even sleep for two or three nights, and in general I didn’t sleep much then, I was in a fever; my heart somehow vaguely sank or suddenly began to jump, jump, jump!. salary. Thus, everything was finally ready; the beautiful beaver took over the place of the nasty raccoon, and I began little by little to get down to business. It was impossible to decide the first time, in vain; it was necessary to handle this matter skillfully, precisely little by little. But I confess that after repeated attempts, I even began to despair: we don’t knock in any way - and that’s all! Whether I was preparing, or I didn’t intend, - it seems that we are about to collide, I look - and again I gave way, and he passed without noticing me. I even read prayers, approaching him, so that God would instill in me determination. Once I was about to make up my mind, but ended up just falling under his feet, because at the very last moment, at some two-inch distance, I didn’t have the courage. He calmly walked over me, and I, like a ball, flew off to the side. That night I was again sick with a fever and delirious. And suddenly everything ended for the best. The night before, I finally decided not to fulfill my pernicious intention and to leave everything in vain, and with this purpose for the last time I went out to the Nevsky, in order to see just like that - how am I going to leave all this in vain? Suddenly, three steps from my enemy, I unexpectedly made up my mind, screwed up my eyes and - we tightly bumped shoulder to shoulder! I did not give up an inch and passed by completely on an equal footing! He did not even look back and pretended not to notice; but he only pretended, I'm sure of it. I'm still sure of it! Of course, I got more; he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I achieved the goal, maintained my dignity, did not give up a single step, and publicly placed myself on an equal social footing with him. I returned home completely avenged for everything. I was delighted. I triumphed and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will not describe to you what happened to me three days later; If you've read my first chapter, Underground, you can guess for yourself. The officer was then transferred somewhere; I haven't seen him for fourteen years now. Is he something now, my darling? Who is pressing?","And the remaining and for me quite considerable sum I decided to try and borrow from Anton Antonych Setochkin, my department chief, a humble but serious and positive man, who never loaned money to anyone, but to whom I had once, on entering my post, been especially recommended by the important personage who had placed me in the civil service. I was terribly tormented. To ask money of Anton Antonych seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I even could not sleep for two or three nights, but then I generally slept little at that time, I was in a fever; my heart was somehow vaguely sinking, or else it would suddenly start to go thump, thump, thump! . . . Anton Antonych was surprised at first, then he frowned, then he considered, and after all he gave me the loan, having me sign an authorization for him to take the loaned money from my salary two weeks later. Thus everything was finally ready; a handsome beaver came to reign in place of the squalid raccoon, and I gradually began to get down to business. I really couldn't just decide it straight off, slapdash; the thing had to be handled deftly, precisely gradually. But I confess that after many attempts I even began to despair: we simply couldn't bump into each other – and that was that! After all my preparations, after all my premeditations – it would look as if we were just about to bump into each other, and then – again I'd give way, and he would pass by without noticing me. I even recited prayers while approaching him, asking God to inspire me with decisiveness. One time I was already quite decided, but it just ended with me getting under his feet, because in the very last moment, at some two inches away, I lost courage. He quite calmly walked over me, and I bounced aside like a ball. That night I was sick again, feverish and delirious. And suddenly everything ended in the best possible way. The night before, I resolved finally not to carry out my pernicious intention and to let it all go for naught, and with that purpose in mind I went to Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I was going to let it all go for naught. Suddenly, within three steps of my enemy, I unexpectedly decided, closed my eyes, and – we bumped solidly shoulder against shoulder! I did not yield an inch and passed by on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look back and pretended not to notice: but he only pretended, I'm sure of that. To this day I'm sure of it! Of course, I got the worst of if, he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had achieved my purpose, preserved my dignity, yielded not a step, and placed myself publicly on an equal social footing with him. I returned home perfectly avenged for everything. I was in ecstasy. I exulted and sang Italian arias. Of course, I shall not describe for you what happened to me three days later; if you've read my first chapter, “Underground,” you can guess for yourself. The officer was later transferred somewhere. I haven't seen him for about fourteen years. What's the sweet fellow doing these days? Whom does he crush now?","The remaining amount, a very considerable one, I decided I would try to borrow from my immediate superior, Anton Antonovich Setochkin, an unassuming but solid and worthy man who never lent money to anybody, but to whom I had been specially recommended when I entered the government service by the important personage who had procured the post for me. I was terribly worried. Asking Anton Antonovich for money seemed to me a monstrous and shameful thing. For two or three nights it even prevented me from sleeping, and indeed at that time I did not ever sleep much; I was in a turmoil, and my heartbeats now seemed to sink and die away, now became a heavy thumping and throbbing…. Anton Antonovich was taken aback at first, then he frowned on my request, then he thought better of it and made the loan in return for a receipt giving him the right to be repaid the sum he had lent me out of my salary in two weeks’ time. Thus at last everything was ready; the beautiful beaver collar reigned in the place of the vile raccoon, and I began a gradual approach to the deed itself. After all, I couldn’t just decide on the spur of the moment and at the first opportunity; this affair must be managed skilfully and by degrees. But I confess that after many vain efforts I was almost reduced to despair: we never should come into collision, that was flat! Once, when I wasn’t ready and had no plans made, it looked all at once as if we were on the point of colliding – and again I stood aside and he went past without even seeing me. I began putting up prayers every time I approached him that God would strengthen my resolution. Once, when I had definitely made my mind up, I ended by simply falling under his feet, because my courage failed in the very last second, when I was only about two inches away from him. He advanced calmly upon me and I rolled aside like a ball. That night I was again feverish and delirious. But suddenly everything ended in the best possible fashion. On the previous night I had definitely decided not to pursue an enterprise foredoomed to failure but to leave it unfulfilled, and with this in mind I went out to walk along the Nevsky Prospect for the last time, so as to see how it was I came to be leaving my purpose unfulfilled. Suddenly, three paces away from my adversary, I unexpectedly made up my mind, scowled fiercely, and… our shoulders came squarely into collision! I did not yield an inch, but walked past on an exactly equal footing! He did not even glance round, and pretended he had not noticed; but he was only pretending, I am certain of that. I am certain of it to this day! Of course I was the greatest sufferer, since he was the stronger; but that was not the point. The point was that I had attained my object, upheld my dignity, not yielded an inch, and publicly placed myself on an equal social footing with him. I returned home completely vindicated. I was delighted. I sang triumphant arias from the Italian operas. Of course I shall not describe what happened to me a couple of days later; if you have read my first chapter, ‘The Underground’, you will be able to guess for yourselves. – The officer was later transferred elsewhere; it is fourteen years since I last saw him. Where is he now, my darling officer? Whom is he trampling down now?","The rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me. In this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver replaced the mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It would never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be carried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many efforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I made every preparation, I was quite determined—it seemed as though we should run into one another directly—and before I knew what I was doing I had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me. I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me determination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I was six inches from him my courage failed me. He very calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball. That night I was ill again, feverish and delirious. And suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with that object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would abandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly made up my mind—I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to shoulder, against one another! I did not budge an inch and passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look round and pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst of it—he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him.

"Я, например, ужасно самолюбив. Я мнителен и обидчив, как горбун или карлик, но, право, бывали со мною такие минуты, что если б случилось, что мне бы дали пощечину, то, может быть, я был бы даже и этому рад. Говорю серьезно: наверно, я бы сумел отыскать и тут своего рода наслаждение, разумеется, наслаждение отчаяния, но в отчаянии-то и бывают самые жгучие наслаждения, особенно когда уж очень сильно сознаешь безвыходность своего положения. А тут при пощечине-то — да тут так и придавит сознание о том, в какую мазь тебя растерли. Главное же, как ни раскидывай, а все-таки выходит, что всегда я первый во всем виноват выхожу и, что всего обиднее, без вины виноват и, так сказать, по законам природы. Потому, во-первых, виноват, что я умнее всех, которые меня окружают. (Я постоянно считал себя умнее всех, которые меня окружают, и иногда, поверите ли, даже этого совестился. По крайней мере, я всю жизнь смотрел как-то в сторону и никогда не мог смотреть людям прямо в глаза). Потому, наконец, виноват, что если б и было во мне великодушие, то было бы только мне же муки больше от сознания всей его бесполезности. Я ведь, наверно, ничего бы не сумел сделать из моего великодушия: ни простить, потому что обидчик, может, ударил меня по законам природы, а законов природы нельзя прощать; ни забыть, потому что хоть и законы природы, а все-таки обидно. Наконец, если б даже я захотел быть вовсе невеликодушным, а напротив, пожелал бы отмстить обидчику, то я и отмстить ни в чем никому бы не мог, потому что, наверно, не решился бы что-нибудь сделать, если б даже и мог. Отчего не решился бы? Об этом мне хочется сказать два слова особо.","For example, I am terribly selfish. I am suspicious and touchy, like a hunchback or a dwarf, but, really, there have been such moments with me that if it happened that they gave me a slap in the face, then perhaps I would even be glad of it. I say seriously: I would probably be able to find a kind of pleasure here too, of course, the pleasure of despair, but in despair there are the most burning pleasures, especially when you are already very aware of the hopelessness of your situation. And here, with a slap in the face - yes, here the consciousness will press down on what kind of ointment they rubbed you into. The main thing, no matter how you spread it, it still turns out that I am always the first to blame for everything and, what is most offensive of all, I am guilty without guilt and, so to speak, according to the laws of nature. Because, first of all, it's my fault that I'm smarter than everyone around me. (I constantly considered myself smarter than everyone around me, and sometimes, believe me, I even felt ashamed of it. At least, all my life I somehow looked to the side and could never look people straight in the eye). Because, finally, I am to blame, because even if there was magnanimity in me, it would only be more torment for me from the consciousness of all its uselessness. After all, I probably would not have been able to do anything out of my generosity: not to forgive, because the offender may have hit me according to the laws of nature, and the laws of nature cannot be forgiven; not to forget, because even though the laws of nature, but still insulting. Finally, even if I wanted to be completely ungenerous, but on the contrary, wished to take revenge on the offender, then I could not take revenge on anyone in anything, because, probably, I would not have dared to do anything, even if I could. Why wouldn't you dare? I would like to say two words about this.","I have, for example, a terrible amour propre. I am as insecure and touchy as a hunchback or a dwarf, yet there have indeed been moments when if I had happened to be slapped, I might even have been glad of it. I say it seriously: surely I'd have managed to discover some sort of pleasure in that as well – the pleasure of despair, of course, but it is in despair that the most burning pleasures occur, especially when one is all too highly conscious of the hopelessness of one's position. And here, with this slap – you'll simply be crushed by the consciousness of what sort of slime you've been reduced to. But chiefly, however you shuffle, it still comes out that I always come out as the first to blame for everything and, what's most offensive, blamelessly to blame, according to the laws of nature, so to speak. I'm to blame, first, because I'm more intelligent than everyone around me. (I've always considered myself more intelligent than everyone around me, and, would you believe, have even felt slightly ashamed of it. At least I've somehow averted my eyes all my life, and never could look people straight in the face.) I'm to blame, finally, because even if there were any magnanimity in me, I would be the one most tormented by the consciousness of its utter futility. For I would surely be able to do nothing with my magnanimity: neither to forgive, because my offender might have hit me according to the laws of nature, and the laws of nature cannot be forgiven; nor to forget, because even though it's the laws of nature, it's still offensive. Finally, even if I should want to be altogether unmagnanimous, if, on the contrary, I should wish to take revenge on my offender, I wouldn't be able to take revenge on anyone in any way, because I surely wouldn't dare to do anything even if I could. Why wouldn't I dare? About that I would like to say a couple of words in particular.","For example, I’m very touchy. I’m sensitive and quick to take offence, like a hunchback or a dwarf, but there have been times when if somebody had given me a slap in the face I might even have been glad of it. I am speaking seriously: I should certainly have known how to find pleasure in it, the pleasure, of course, of despair, but despair can hold the most intense sorts of pleasure when one is strongly conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position. And here, with the slap in the face, it is forced in upon you what filth you are smeared with. The main thing is that, however you look at it, it always turns out that you are chiefly to blame for everything, and what hurts most of all, innocently to blame, by the laws of nature, as it were. I am to blame because, first of all, I am cleverer than anybody else around me. (I have always thought myself cleverer than anybody I knew, and sometimes, if you will name=""page_20"">believe me, I have felt quite ashamed of it. In any case, I have always turned my eyes away and never been able to look anybody straight in the face.) And, finally, I am to blame because even if I had had any generosity of spirit in me, it would only have been a greater torment to me to realize its complete uselessness. After all, I should probably have been unable to do anything with my generosity of soul; neither forgive, because the person who offended me might have been following the laws of nature, and you can’t forgive the laws of nature; nor forget, because even if it was according to the laws of nature, it was still an affront. Finally, even if I refused to show any generosity of spirit, but wanted to be revenged for the insult, I couldn’t even take my revenge on anybody for anything, because I should probably find it impossible to make up my mind to take any steps, even if I could. Why not? I should like to say a word or two about that in particular.","I, for instance, have a great deal of amour propre. I am as suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon my word I sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it. I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position. And when one is slapped in the face—why then the consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face.) To blame, finally, because even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to. Why should I not have made up my mind? About that in particular I want to say a few words."
— Русская.,- Russian.,“Russian.”,"‘No, Russian.’","“No, Russian.”"
"Ну разве можно, разве можно хоть сколько-нибудь уважать себя человеку, который даже в самом чувстве собственного унижения посягнул отыскать наслаждение? Я не от приторного какого-нибудь раскаянья так теперь говорю. Да и вообще терпеть я не мог говорить: «Простите, папаша, вперед не буду», — не потому, чтоб я не способен был это сказать, а напротив, может быть, именно потому, что уж слишком способен на это бывал, да еще как? Как нарочно и влопаюсь, бывало, в таком случае, когда сам ни сном, ни духом не виноват. Это уже было всего гаже. При этом я опять-таки душою умилялся, раскаивался, слезы проливал и, конечно, самого себя надувал, хоть и вовсе не притворялся. Сердце уж тут как-то гадило… Тут уж даже и законов природы нельзя было обвинить, хотя все-таки законы природы постоянно и более всего всю жизнь меня обижали. Гадко это все вспоминать, да и тогда гадко было. Ведь через минуту какую-нибудь я уже с злобою соображаю, бывало, что все это ложь, ложь, отвратительная напускная ложь, то есть все эти раскаяния, все эти умиления, все эти обеты возрождения. А спросите, для чего я так сам себя коверкал и мучил? Ответ: затем, что скучно уж очень было сложа руки сидеть; вот и пускался на выверты. Право, так. Замечайте получше сами за собой, господа, тогда и поймете, что это так. Сам себе приключения выдумывал и жизнь сочинял, чтоб хоть как-нибудь да пожить. Сколько раз мне случалось — ну, хоть, например, обижаться, так, не из-за чего, нарочно; и ведь сам знаешь, бывало, что не из-за чего обиделся, напустил на себя, но до того себя доведешь, что под конец, право, и в самом деле обидишься. Меня как-то всю жизнь тянуло такие штуки выкидывать, так что уж я стал под конец и в себе не властен. Другой раз влюбиться насильно захотел, даже два раза. Страдал ведь, господа, уверяю вас. В глубине-то души не верится, что страдаешь, насмешка шевелится, а все-таки страдаю, да еще настоящим, заправским образом; ревную, из себя выхожу… И все от скуки, господа, все от скуки; инерция задавила. Ведь прямой, законный, непосредственный плод сознания — это инерция, то есть сознательное сложа-руки-сиденье. Я уж об этом упоминал выше. Повторяю, усиленно повторяю: все непосредственные люди и деятели потому и деятельны, что они тупы и ограничены. Как это объяснить? А вот как: они вследствие своей ограниченности ближайшие и второстепенные причины за первоначальные принимают, таким образом скорее и легче других убеждаются, что непреложное основание своему делу нашли, ну и успокоиваются; а ведь это главное. Ведь чтоб начать действовать, нужно быть совершенно успокоенным предварительно, и чтоб сомнений уж никаких не оставалось. Ну а как я, например, себя успокою? Где у меня первоначальные причины, на которые я упрусь, где основания? Откуда я их возьму? Я упражняюсь в мышлении, а следственно, у меня всякая первоначальная причина тотчас же тащит за собою другую, еще первоначальнее, и так далее в бесконечность. Такова именно сущность всякого сознания и мышления. Это уже опять, стало быть, законы природы. Что же наконец в результате? Да то же самое. Вспомните: давеча вот я говорил о мщении. (Вы, верно, не вникли). Сказано: человек мстит, потому что находит в этом справедливость. Значит, он первоначальную причину нашел, основание нашел, а именно: справедливость. Стало быть, он со всех сторон успокоен, а следственно, и отмщает спокойно и успешно, будучи убежден, что делает честное и справедливое дело. А ведь я справедливости тут не вижу, добродетели тоже никакой не нахожу, а следственно, если стану мстить, то разве только из злости. Злость, конечно, могла бы все пересилить, все мои сомнения, и, стало быть могла бы совершенно успешно послужить вместо первоначальной причины именно потому, что она не причина. Но что же делать, если у меня и злости нет (я давеча ведь с этого и начал). Злоба у меня опять-таки вследствие этих проклятых законов сознания химическому разложению подвергается. Смотришь — предмет улетучивается, резоны испаряются, виновник не отыскивается, обида становится не обидой, а фатумом, чем-то вроде зубной боли, в которой никто не виноват, а следовательно, остается опять-таки тот же самый выход — то есть стену побольнее прибить. Ну и рукой махнешь, потому что не нашел первоначальной причины. А попробуй увлекись своим чувством слепо, без рассуждений, без первоначальной причины, отгоняя сознание хоть на это время; возненавидь или полюби, чтоб только не сидеть сложа руки. Послезавтра, это уж самый поздний срок, самого себя презирать начнешь за то, что самого себя зазнамо надул. В результате: мыльный пузырь и инерция. О господа, ведь я, может, потому только и считаю себя за умного человека, что всю жизнь ничего не мог ни начать, ни окончить. Пусть, пусть я болтун, безвредный, досадный болтун, как и все мы. Но что же делать, если прямое и единственное назначение всякого умного человека есть болтовня, то есть умышленное пересыпанье из пустого в порожнее.","Well, is it possible, is it possible to have any respect for oneself to a person who, even in the very feeling of his own humiliation, has encroached on finding pleasure? I am not saying this now out of any cloying remorse. And in general, I could not bear to say: “Forgive me, papa, I won’t go ahead,” not because I was not able to say it, but on the contrary, perhaps precisely because I was already too capable of it, and moreover as? As if on purpose, I’ll burst into it, it happened, in such a case, when I myself am not to blame either in sleep or in spirit. It was already the worst. At the same time, I was again touched by my soul, repented, shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, although I did not pretend at all. My heart somehow spoiled here ... Here, even the laws of nature could not be blamed, although, nevertheless, the laws of nature constantly and most of all offended me all my life. It’s disgusting to remember all this, and even then it was disgusting. Indeed, after a minute or so, I already realize with malice, it happened that all this is a lie, a lie, a disgusting feigned lie, that is, all these repentances, all these tenderness, all these vows of rebirth. And ask, why did I distort and torture myself like that? Answer: then, that it was very boring to sit idly by; here he went for tricks. Right, yes. Take a better look at yourself, gentlemen, and then you will understand that this is so. He invented adventures for himself and composed his life in order to live at least somehow. How many times have I happened - well, at least, for example, to be offended, so, for no reason, on purpose; and you know yourself, it happened that for no reason you were offended, let loose on yourself, but you will bring yourself to such a point that in the end, really, you will be offended. Somehow, all my life, I was drawn to throwing out such things, so that in the end I became in the end and had no power in myself. Another time I forcibly wanted to fall in love, even twice. I suffered, gentlemen, I assure you. In the depths of my soul, I can’t believe that you are suffering, mockery stirs, but still I suffer, and even in a real, real way; jealous, losing my temper ... And all from boredom, gentlemen, all from boredom; inertia crushed. After all, the direct, legitimate, immediate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, a conscious folded-hands-seat. I already mentioned this above. I repeat, I repeat emphatically: all direct people and leaders are active because they are stupid and limited. How to explain it? And here's how: due to their limitations, they take the immediate and secondary causes for the initial ones, thus, more quickly and easily than others, they are convinced that they have found an immutable foundation for their work, and they calm down; and that's the main thing. After all, in order to begin to act, you need to be completely reassured beforehand, and so that there are no doubts left. Well, how can I calm myself down, for example? Where are my initial reasons, on which I rest, where are the foundations? Where can I get them? I practice thinking, and consequently, for me, every primary cause immediately drags behind it another, even more primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such is precisely the essence of all consciousness and thinking. This is again, therefore, the laws of nature. What is the final result? Yes, the same. Remember: just now I was talking about vengeance. (You probably didn't get it.) It is said: a man takes revenge because he finds justice in it. This means that he found the original cause, found the foundation, namely: justice. Therefore, he is reassured on all sides, and consequently, he avenges calmly and successfully, being convinced that he is doing an honest and just deed. But I don’t see justice here, I don’t find any virtue either, and consequently, if I take revenge, it’s only out of anger. Anger, of course, could overpower everything, all my doubts, and, therefore, could quite successfully serve in place of the original cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what should I do if I don’t even have anger (I just started with this just now). Again, as a result of these accursed laws of consciousness, my malice undergoes chemical decomposition. You look - the object disappears, the reasons evaporate, the culprit is not found, the insult becomes not an insult, but a fate, something like a toothache in which no one is to blame, and therefore, again, the same way out remains - that is, the wall is harder to nail . Well, wave your hand, because you did not find the original cause. And try to get carried away by your feeling blindly, without reasoning, without the original reason, driving away the consciousness at least for this time; hate or love, so as not to sit idly by. The day after tomorrow, this is already the latest date, you will begin to despise yourself for having deliberately deceived yourself. The result: a soap bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, maybe the only reason I consider myself an intelligent person is that all my life I could neither start nor finish anything. May, may I be a talker, a harmless, annoying talker, like the rest of us. But what is to be done if the direct and only purpose of any intelligent person is chatter, that is, deliberate spilling over from empty to empty.","No, how is it possible, how is it at all possible for a man to have the slightest respect for himself, if he has presumed to find pleasure even in the very sense of his own humiliation? I am not speaking this way now out of some cloying repentance. And, generally, I hated saying: “Forgive me, papa, I won't do it again” – not because I was incapable of saying it, but, on the contrary, perhaps precisely because I was all too capable of it. And how! As if on purpose, I used to bumble into it on occasions when I'd never thought or dreamed of doing anything wrong. That was the nastiest thing of all. And there I'd be again, waxing tenderhearted, repenting, shedding tears, and certainly hoodwinking myself, though I wasn't pretending in the least. It was my heart that somehow kept mucking things up . . . Here even the laws of nature could no longer be blamed, though still, throughout my life, the laws of nature have offended me constantly and more than anything else. It's nasty to look back on it all, and it was nasty then as well. For a minute or so later I'd be reasoning spitefully that it was all a lie, a lie, a loathsome, affected lie – that is, all these repentances, tenderheartednesses, all these vows of regeneration. And you ask why I twisted and tormented myself so? Answer: because it was just too boring to sit there with folded arms, that's why I'd get into such flourishes. Really, it was so. Observe yourselves more closely, gentlemen, and you'll understand that it is so. I made up adventures and devised a life for myself so as to live, at least somehow, a little. How many times it happened to me – well, say, for example, to feel offended, just so, for no reason, on purpose; and I'd know very well that I felt offended for no reason, that I was affecting it, but you can drive yourself so far that in the end, really, you do indeed get offended. Somehow all my life I've had an urge to pull such stunts, so that in the end I could no longer control myself. Another time, twice even, I decided to force myself to fall in love. And I did suffer, gentlemen, I assure you. Deep in one's soul it's hard to believe one is suffering, mockery is stirring there, but all the same I suffer, and in a real, honest-to-god way; I get jealous, lose my temper . . . And all that from boredom, gentlemen, all from boredom; crushed by inertia. For the direct, lawful, immediate fruit of consciousness is inertia – that is, a conscious sitting with folded arms. I've already mentioned this above. I repeat, I emphatically repeat: ingenuous people and active figures are all active simply because they are dull and narrow-minded. How to explain it? Here's how: as a consequence of their narrow-mindedness, they take the most immediate and secondary causes for the primary ones, and thus become convinced more quickly and easily than others that they have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel at ease; and that, after all, is the main thing. For in order to begin to act, one must first be completely at ease, so that no more doubts remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set myself at ease? Where are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where am I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me every primary cause immediately drags with it yet another, still more primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such is precisely the essence of all consciousness and thought. So, once again it's the laws of nature. And what, finally, is the result? The same old thing. Remember: I was speaking just now about revenge. (You probably didn't grasp it.) I said: a man takes revenge because he finds justice in it. That means he has found a primary cause, a basis – namely, justice. So he is set at ease on all sides and, consequently, takes his revenge calmly and successfully, being convinced that he is doing an honest and just thing. Whereas I do not see any justice here, nor do I find any virtue in it, and, consequently, if I set about taking revenge, it will be solely out of wickedness. Wickedness could, of course, overcome everything, all my doubts, and thus could serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely in that it is not a cause. But what's to be done if there is also no wickedness in me? (I did begin with that just now.) The spite in me, again as a consequence of those cursed laws of consciousness, undergoes a chemical breakdown. Before your eyes the object vanishes, the reasons evaporate, the culprit is not to be found, the offense becomes not an offense but a fatum, something like a toothache, for which no one is to blame, and, consequently, what remains is again the same way out – that is, to give the wall a painful beating. And so you just wave it aside, because you haven't found the primary cause. But try getting blindly carried away by your feelings, without reasoning, without a primary cause, driving consciousness away at least for a time; start hating, or fall in love, only so as not to sit with folded arms. The day after tomorrow, at the very latest, you'll begin to despise yourself for having knowingly hoodwinked yourself. The result: a soap bubble, and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life I've never been able to start or finish anything. Granted, granted I'm a babbler, a harmless, irksome babbler, as we all are. But what's to be done if the sole and express purpose of every intelligent man is babble – that is, a deliberate pouring from empty into void.","No, a man can’t have a trace of self-respect, can he, who has attempted to find his pleasure in the consciousness of his own degradation? I’m not saying this out of some sort of pretended repentance. I never could bear, anyhow, to say, ‘Forgive me, Daddy dear, I won’t do it again,’ not because I was incapable of saying the words, but on the contrary, perhaps because I was too capable of saying them, and on what occasions? As sure as fate, I used to come out with them when I was absolutely innocent. That was the most degraded aspect of it. In such circumstances, I would be deeply moved, filled with remorse, and shedding tears, and, of course, I was deceiving myself, although I wasn’t consciously pretending. My heart seemed to purge itself of its own accord…. For this I couldn’t even blame the laws of nature, although I have always resented the laws of nature more than anything else all my life. It is degrading to remember all this, and it was degrading at the time, too. Of course, after a few minutes I would be reflecting that the whole thing was a lie, a disgusting lie, an unnatural lie – all that remorse, I mean, all those emotions, all those promises of regeneration. Do you ask why I tortured and tormented myself? The answer is that it was too boring to sit and do nothing, and so I indulged my fancy. That really is true. Watch yourselves as closely as you can, gentlemen, and you will see that it’s true. I imagined happenings, I invented a life, so that I should at any rate live. How many times have I – well – taken offence, for example, just like that, deliberately, for no reason at all? And, you know, one always knew that one was taking offence at nothing at all, putting on an act, but one went to such lengths that at last one really and truly felt affronted. I’ve had a tendency all my life to play that kind of trick, so much so that, in the end, I really lost all control over myself. There was one time, or even two, when I simply longed to fall in love. I really suffered, gentlemen, I assure you. At the bottom of my heart I can’t believe in my own suffering, I feel a stirring of derision, but all the same I do suffer, and in a real, definite fashion; I am jealous, I fly into rages…. And all out of boredom, gentlemen, all out of boredom; I am crushed with tedium. After all, the direct, immediate, legitimate fruit of heightened consciousness is inertia, that is, the deliberate refusal to do anything. I have mentioned this before. I repeat, and repeat emphatically: all spontaneous people, men of action, are active because they are stupid and limited. How is this to be explained? Like this: in consequence of their limitations they take immediate, but secondary, causes for primary ones, and thus they are more quickly and easily convinced than other people that they have found indisputable grounds for their action, and they are easy in their minds; and this, you know, is the main thing. After all, in order to act, one must be absolutely sure of oneself, no doubts must remain anywhere. But how am I, for example, to be sure of myself? Where are the primary causes on which I can take my stand, where are my foundations? Where am I to take them from? I practise thinking, and consequently each of my primary causes pulls along another, even more primary, in its wake, and so on ad infinitum. That is really the essence of all thinking and self-awareness. Perhaps this, once again, is a law of nature. And what, finally, is the result? The same thing over again. Do you remember that I was talking just now about revenge? (You probably didn’t understand me.) I said a man takes his revenge because he finds justice in it. That means he has found his primary reason, his foundation, namely justice. Thus he is easy on all counts, and consequently takes his revenge calmly and successfully, being convinced that he is performing a just and honourable action. But really I can’t find any justice, or any kind of virtue, in it, and consequently, if I take my revenge, it is purely out of resentment. Resentment, of course, might overcome all my doubts and hesitations, and might therefore serve quite successfully instead of a primary cause, precisely because it isn’t a cause. But what can I do if I don’t even feel resentment? (This was my starting-point of a short time ago.) My anger, in consequence of the damned laws of consciousness, is subject to chemical decomposition. As you look, its object vanishes into thin air, its reasons evaporate, the offender is nowhere to be found, the affront ceases to be an offence and becomes destiny, something like toothache, for which nobody is to blame, and consequently there remains only the same outcome, which is banging one’s head as hard as one can against the stone wall. Well, you shrug it off, because you haven’t found a primary cause. But try letting yourself be carried along blindly by your feelings, banish your reason if only for the moment; hate, or love, anything rather than do nothing. The day after tomorrow, at the very latest, you will begin to despise yourself for your conscious self-deception. The result is a soap-bubble, and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, perhaps the only reason I consider myself a clever man is that I have never in all my life been able to either begin or finish anything. A windbag I may be, an ineffective, irritating windbag, like all of us. But what can one do, if the only straightforward task of every intelligent man is pointless chattering, the deliberate pouring out of emptiness?","Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am not saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I could never endure saying, “Forgive me, Papa, I won’t do it again,” not because I am incapable of saying that—on the contrary, perhaps just because I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too. As though of design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to blame in any way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the same time I was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the time.... For that one could not blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one’s hands folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way. How many times it has happened to me—well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself. Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all from ennui, gentlemen, all from ennui; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I repeat , I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why, just the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause, that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know). In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left again—that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?"
"— Кто говорит! — поспешил я ответить, — все бывает. Я ведь вот уверен, что тебя кто-нибудь обидел и скорей перед тобой виноваты, чем ты перед ними.

I'm sure that someone offended you and they are more to blame for you than you are for them. After all, I don’t know anything from your history, but a girl like you, it’s true, it’s not from her hunt that she will get here ...","“Who can say!” I hastened to reply. ”All sorts of things happen. Now, I'm sure someone wronged you, and it's rather they who are guilty before you than you before them. I know nothing of your story, but a girl of your sort certainly wouldn't come here of her own liking . . .”","‘Who can tell?’ I hastened to answer; ‘everything is possible. I’m sure, you know, that somebody wronged you, and you were more sinned against than sinning. I know nothing of your history, but a girl like you doesn’t come here of her own choice…’","“Who denies it!” I hastened to answer. “Anything may happen. I am convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned against than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it’s not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination....”"

"Я презрительно улыбался и ходил по другую сторону комнаты, прямо против дивана, вдоль стены, от стола до печки и обратно. Всеми силами я хотел показать, что могу и без них обойтись; а между тем нарочно стучал сапогами, становясь на каблуки. Но все было напрасно. Они-то и не обращали внимания. Я имел терпенье проходить так, прямо перед ними, с восьми до одиннадцати часов, все по одному и тому же месту, от стола до печки и от печки обратно к столу. «Так хожу себе, и никто не может мне запретить». Входивший в комнату слуга несколько раз останавливался смотреть на меня; от частых оборотов у меня кружилась голова; минутами мне казалось, что я в бреду. В эти три часа я три раза вспотел и просох. Порой с глубочайшею, с ядовитою болью вонзалась в мое сердце мысль: что пройдет десять лет, двадцать лет, сорок лет, а я все-таки, хоть и через сорок лет, с отвращением и с унижением вспомню об этих грязнейших, смешнейших и ужаснейших минутах из всей моей жизни. Бессовестнее и добровольнее унижать себя самому было уже невозможно, и я вполне, вполне понимал это и все-таки продолжал ходить от стола до печки и обратно. «О, если б вы только знали, на какие чувства и мысли способен я и как я развит!» — думал я минутами; мысленно обращаясь к дивану, где сидели враги мои. Но враги мои вели себя так, как будто меня и не было в комнате. Раз, один только раз они обернулись ко мне, именно когда Зверков заговорил о Шекспире, а я вдруг презрительно захохотал. Я так выделанно и гадко фыркнул, что они все разом прервали разговор и молча наблюдали минуты две, серьезно, не смеясь, как я хожу по стенке, от стола до печки, и как я не обращаю на них никакого внимания. Но ничего не вышло: они не заговорили и через две минуты опять меня бросили. Пробило одиннадцать.","I smiled contemptuously and walked on the other side of the room, right in front of the sofa, along the wall, from the table to the stove and back. With all my strength I wanted to show that I could do without them; but meanwhile he purposely knocked with his boots, standing on his heels. But it was all in vain. They didn't even pay attention. I had the patience to walk like this, right in front of them, from eight to eleven o'clock, all in the same place, from the table to the stove and from the stove back to the table. ""That's how I walk myself, and no one can forbid me."" The servant who entered the room stopped several times to look at me; I was dizzy from frequent revolutions; For a moment I thought I was delirious. During these three hours I sweated and dried out three times. Sometimes, with the deepest, poisonous pain, the thought pierced into my heart: that ten years, twenty years, forty years will pass, and yet, even after forty years, I will remember with disgust and humiliation about these dirtiest, funniest and most terrible minutes. from all my life. It was no longer possible to humiliate myself more shamelessly and voluntarily, and I fully, fully understood this, and nevertheless continued to walk from the table to the stove and back. “Oh, if you only knew what feelings and thoughts I am capable of and how developed I am!” I thought for minutes; mentally referring to the sofa where my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as if I were not even in the room. Once, only once, they turned to me, precisely when Zverkov started talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly laughed contemptuously. I snorted so formally and disgustingly that they all interrupted the conversation at once and silently watched for about two minutes, seriously, not laughing, as I walk along the wall, from the table to the stove, and how I pay no attention to them. But nothing came of it: they did not speak, and two minutes later they left me again. It struck eleven.","I was smiling contemptuously and pacing the other side of the room, directly opposite the sofa, along the wall, from the table to the stove and back. I wished with all my might to show that I could do without them; and yet I purposely clumped with my boots, coming down hard on the heels. But all in vain. They paid no attention. I had patience enough to pace like that, right in front of them, from eight o'clock to eleven, in one and the same space, from the table to the stove, and from the stove back to the table. ”I'm just pacing, and no one can tell me not to.” A waiter who kept coming into the room paused several times to look at me; my head was spinning from so much turning; at moments I thought I was delirious. I sweated and dried out three times in those three hours. Every once in a while a thought pierced my heart with the deepest, most poisonous pain: that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass, and even after forty years I would still recall with revulsion and humiliation these dirtiest, most ridiculous, and most terrible minutes of my entire life. For a man to humiliate himself more shamelessly and more voluntarily was really impossible, I fully, fully understood that, and still I went on pacing from the table to the stove and back. ”Oh , if you only knew what feelings and thoughts I'm capable of, and how developed I am!” I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa where my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as if I were not even in the room. Once, once only, they turned to me – namely, when Zverkov began talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly guffawed contemptuously. I snorted so affectedly and nastily that they all broke off the conversation at once and silently watched me for about two minutes, seriously, without laughing, as I paced along the wall from table to stove and paid no attention to them. But nothing came of it; they did not start talking to me, and after two minutes dropped me again. It struck eleven.","Smiling scornfully, I paced backwards and forwards on the side of the room opposite the sofa, along the wall from the table to the stove and back. I was trying with all my might to show that I could do without them; meanwhile I purposely made a clatter with my boots, coming down hard on the heels. But it was all in vain; they didn’t even notice. I had the patience to walk about straight in front of them in this fashion from eight o’clock till eleven, always in the same track, from the table to the stove and from the stove back again to the table: ‘I am walking to please myself and nobody can stop me.’ The servant, coming into the room, several times stopped to stare at me; my head was dizzy from the frequent turns; there were times when I thought I was delirious. In those three hours I three times burst into a sweat and dried out again. At times the idea pierced into my heart with the most agonizing pain that ten years might pass, twenty years, forty years, and still, after forty years, I should remember with loathing and humiliation those hours, the nastiest, most comical, and most terrible of my whole life. To humiliate oneself more shamelessly and wilfully was impossible, and this I fully, all too fully, understood, yet all the same I continued to pace from the table to the stove and back. ‘ Oh, if only you know what thoughts and emotions I am capable of, and how enlightened I am!’ I thought sometimes, turning in imagination to the sofa where my enemies sat. But my enemies acted as though I wasn’t even in the room. Once, and only once, they turned towards me, and that was when Zverkov began to talk about Shakespeare and I let out a sudden contemptuous laugh. It was such a vilely artificial snort that they all ceased talking at once and silently watched me for about two minutes, attentively and seriously, as I walked along the wall from the table to the stove, without paying them the slightest attention. But nothing happened: they did not speak to me and after two minutes they ignored me again. Eleven o’clock struck.","I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up and down in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same place, from the table to the stove and back again. “I walk up and down to please myself and no one can prevent me.” The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. “Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!” I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as though I were not in the room. Once—only once—they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove, taking no notice of them.

"(Ни одного разу я не видал, да и на Волковом никогда не был, а только слышал, как рассказывали).","(I have never seen a single one, and I have never been to Volkovo, but only heard how they were told).","(I had never once seen it, and had never been in the Volkovo cemetery, but had only heard people talk.)","(I had never seen it, indeed had never been to Volkovo Cemetery – I had only heard people talking about it.)","(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had only heard stories of it.)"
"— Постойте, господа, я и сам так начать хотел. Я, признаюсь, даже испугался. Я только что хотел было прокричать, что хотенье ведь черт знает от чего зависит и что это, пожалуй, и слава богу, да вспомнил про науку-то и… оселся. А вы тут и заговорили. Ведь в самом деле, ну, если вправду найдут когда-нибудь формулу всех наших хотений и капризов, то есть от чего они зависят, по каким именно законам происходят, как именно распространяются, куда стремятся в таком-то и в таком-то случае и проч., и проч., то есть настоящую математическую формулу, — так ведь тогда человек тотчас же, пожалуй, и перестанет хотеть, да еще, пожалуй, и наверно перестанет. Ну что за охота хотеть по табличке? Мало того: тотчас же обратится он из человека в органный штифтик или вроде того; потому, что же такое человек без желаний, без воли и без хотений, как не штифтик в органном вале? Как вы думаете? Сосчитаем вероятности, — может это случиться или нет?","“Wait, gentlemen, I myself wanted to start like that. I admit, I was even scared. I just wanted to shout out that desire, after all, the devil knows what depends on it, and that it is, perhaps, thank God, but I remembered about science and ... settled down. And here you are talking. After all, in fact, well, if they really ever find a formula for all our desires and whims, that is, on what they depend, according to what laws they occur, exactly how they spread, where they strive in such and such a case, and etc., etc., that is, a real mathematical formula—so then, perhaps, a person will immediately stop wanting, and even, perhaps, he will probably stop. Well, what kind of hunting to want on the plate? Not only that: he will immediately turn from a man into an organ pin or something like that; because what is a man without desires, without will and without desires, if not a brad in an organ shaft? What do you think? Let's calculate the probabilities - can this happen or not?","but . . .” Wait, gentlemen, I myself wanted to begin that way. I confess, I even got scared. I just wanted to cry out that wanting depends on the devil knows what, and thank God, perhaps, for that, but I remembered about this science and . . . backed off. And just then you started talking. And indeed, well, if one day they really find the formula for all our wantings and caprices – that is, what they depend on, by precisely what laws they occur, precisely how they spread, what they strive for in such-and-such a case, and so on and so forth; a real, mathematical formula, that is – then perhaps man will immediately stop wanting; what's more, perhaps he will certainly stop. Who wants to want according to a little table? Moreover: he will immediately turn from a man into a sprig in an organ or something of the sort; because what is man without desires, without will, and without wantings, if not a sprig in an organ barrel? What do you think? – let's reckon up the probabilities – can it happen or not?","Just a minute, gentlemen, that’s how I was going to begin. I confess I shirked it. I was just about to exclaim that the devil only knows what volition depends on, and perhaps it’s just as well, but I remembered about science and… stopped short. And you came in at that point. As a matter of fact, though, if the formula for all our desires and whims is some day discovered – I mean what they depend on, what laws they result from, how they are disseminated, what sort of good they aspire to in a particular instance, and so on – a real mathematical formula, that is, then it is possible that man will at once cease to want anything, indeed I suppose it is possible that he will cease to exist. Well, what’s the point of wishing by numbers? Furthermore, he will at once turn from a man into a barrel-organ sprig or something of the sort; for what is man without desires, without will, without volition, but a sprig on the cylinder of a barrel-organ? What do you think? Let us consider the probabilities – could this happen or not?","Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was rather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows what choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing, but I remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And here you have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices—that is, an explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they develop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on, that is a real mathematical formula—then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ? What do you think? Let us reckon the chances—can such a thing happen or not?"

"«Вот теперь бы и пустить бутылкой во всех», — подумал я, взял бутылку и… налил себе полный стакан.","“Now I should have put a bottle at everyone,” I thought, took the bottle and ... poured myself a full glass.","“Now's the time to up and hurl a bottle at them all,” I thought, took the bottle, and . . . poured myself a full glass.","‘I’d like to sling a bottle at the lot of them this minute,’ I thought, taking up a bottle and – pouring myself a full glass.","“Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,” I thought to myself.

"Из двух гостей Симонова один был Ферфичкин, из русских немцев, — маленький ростом, с обезьяньим лицом, всех пересмеивающий глупец, злейший враг мой еще с низших классов, подлый, дерзкий, фанфаронишка и игравший в самую щекотливую амбициозность, хотя, разумеется, трусишка в душе. Он был из тех почитателей Зверкова, которые заигрывали с ним из видов и часто занимали у него деньги. Другой гость Симонова, Трудолюбов, была личность незамечательная, военный парень, высокого роста, с холодною физиономией, довольно честный, но преклонявшийся перед всяким успехом и способный рассуждать только об одном производстве. Зверкову он доводился каким-то дальним родственником, и это, глупо сказать, придавало ему между нами некоторое значение. Меня он постоянно считал ни во что; обращался же хоть не совсем вежливо, но сносно.","Of Simonov's two guests, one was Ferfichkin, a Russian German, small in stature, with a monkey face, a fool laughing at everyone, my worst enemy from the lower classes, a vile, impudent, pompous little fellow who played at the most ticklish ambition, although, of course, a coward in soul. He was one of those admirers of Zverkov who flirted with him out of sight and often borrowed money from him. Simonov's other guest, Trudolyubov, was an unremarkable personality, a military lad, tall, with a cold physiognomy, quite honest, but bowing before any success and capable of discussing only one production. To Zverkov, he happened to be some kind of distant relative, and this, it is foolish to say, gave him some importance between us. He constantly considered me as nothing; He was not very polite, but tolerable.","Of Simonov's two guests, one was Ferfichkin, from Russian-German stock – short, monkey-faced, a fool who comically mimicked everyone, my bitterest enemy even in the lower grades — a mean, impudent little fanfaron who played at being most ticklishly ambitious, though of course he was a coward at heart. He was one of those admirers of Zverkov who flirted with him for his own ends, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov's other guest, Trudolyubov, was an unremarkable person, a military type, tall, with a cold physiognomy, honest enough, but worshiping any success, and capable only of discussing promotions. He was some sort of distant relation of Zverkov's, and that, silly though it was, endowed him with a certain significance among us. He had always regarded me as nothing, but treated me, if not quite politely, at least passably.","One of Simonov’s two visitors was Ferfichkin, a Russo-German – a small man with a monkey-like face, a stupid fool who poked fun at everybody, and my bitterest enemy ever since we were in the lowest form, a nasty insolent little braggart, posing as a man of extremely touchy sense of honour, although he was of course an abject little coward. He was one of those admirers of Zverkov who played up to him from interested motives and frequently borrowed money from him. Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was an ordinary sort of person, a military type, tall, with a chilly air, quite honourable, but kowtowing to every kind of success and incapable of discussing anything but promotion. He was some sort of distant connection of Zverkov’s and this, stupidly enough, gave him some importance among us. He always considered me a nobody, but treated me tolerably well, if not altogether courteously.","Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German—a little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower forms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way remarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of distant relation of Zverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable."
"Иногда мне приходила мысль самому съездить к ней, «рассказать ей все» и упросить ее не приходить ко мне. Но тут, при этой мысли, во мне подымалась такая злоба, что, кажется, я бы так и раздавил эту «проклятую» Лизу, если б она возле меня вдруг случилась, оскорбил бы ее, оплевал бы, выгнал бы, ударил бы!","Sometimes the thought came to me to go to her, ""tell her everything"" and beg her not to come to me.

"Я уже давно так живу — лет двадцать. Теперь мне сорок. Я прежде служил, а теперь не служу. Я был злой чиновник. Я был груб и находил в этом удовольствие. Ведь я взяток не брал, стало быть, должен же был себя хоть этим вознаградить. (Плохая острота; но я ее не вычеркну. Я ее написал, думая, что выйдет очень остро; а теперь, как увидел сам, что хотел только гнусно пофорсить, — нарочно не вычеркну!) Когда к столу, у которого я сидел, подходили, бывало, просители за справками, — я зубами на них скрежетал и чувствовал неумолимое наслаждение, когда удавалось кого-нибудь огорчить. Почти всегда удавалось. Большею частию все был народ робкий: известно — просители. Но из фертов я особенно терпеть не мог одного офицера. Он никак не хотел покориться и омерзительно гремел саблей. У меня с ним полтора года за эту саблю война была. Я наконец одолел. Он перестал греметь. Впрочем, это случилось еще в моей молодости. Но знаете ли, господа, в чем состоял главный пункт моей злости? Да в том-то и состояла вся штука, в том-то и заключалась наибольшая гадость, что я поминутно, даже в минуту самой сильнейшей желчи, постыдно сознавал в себе, что я не только не злой, но даже и не озлобленный человек, что я только воробьев пугаю напрасно и себя этим тешу. У меня пена у рта, а принесите мне какую-нибудь куколку, дайте мне чайку с сахарцем, я, пожалуй, и успокоюсь. Даже душой умилюсь, хоть уж, наверно, потом буду вам на себя скрежетать зубами и от стыда несколько месяцев страдать бессонницей. Таков уж мой обычай.","I have been living like this for twenty years. Now I'm forty. I used to serve, but now I don't. I was an evil official. I was rude and enjoyed it. After all, I did not take bribes, therefore, I had to at least reward myself with this. (Bad joke; but I won’t cross it out. I wrote it thinking that it would come out very sharp; and now, as I myself saw that I only wanted to show off vilely, I won’t cross it out on purpose!) When they approached the table at which I was sitting , used to be petitioners for information - I gnashed my teeth at them and felt inexorable pleasure when I managed to upset someone. Almost always succeeded. For the most part, they were all timid people: it is known that they were petitioners. But of the forts, I especially could not stand one officer. He did not want to submit in any way and disgustingly rattled his saber. I had a war with him for a year and a half for this saber. I finally won. He stopped rattling. However, this happened when I was young. But do you know, gentlemen, what was the main point of my anger? Yes, that was the whole point, that was the most disgusting thing, that every minute, even at the moment of the strongest bile, I was shamefully aware in myself that I was not only not an evil, but not even an embittered person, that I only frighten sparrows in vain and amuse myself with this. I'm foaming at the mouth, and bring me some doll, give me some tea with sugar, I, perhaps, will calm down. I’ll even be touched by my soul, although I’ll probably gnash my teeth at you later and suffer from insomnia for several months from shame. That is my custom.","I've been living like this for a long time – about twenty years. I'm forty now. I used to be in the civil service; I no longer am. I was a wicked official. I was rude, and took pleasure in it. After all, I didn't accept bribes, so I had to reward myself at least with that. (A bad witticism, but I won't cross it out. I wrote it thinking it would come out very witty; but now, seeing for myself that I simply had a vile wish to swagger – I purposely won't cross it out!) When petitioners would come for information to the desk where I sat – I'd gnash my teeth at them, and felt an inexhaustible delight when I managed to upset someone. I almost always managed. They were timid people for the most part: petitioners, you know. But among the fops there was one officer I especially could not stand. He simply refused to submit and kept rattling his sabre disgustingly. I was at war with him over that sabre for a year and a half. In the end, I prevailed. He stopped rattling. However, that was still in my youth. But do you know, gentlemen, what was the main point about my wickedness? The whole thing precisely was, the greatest nastiness precisely lay in my being shamefully conscious every moment, even in moments of the greatest bile, that I was not only not a wicked but was not even an embittered man, that I was simply frightening sparrows in vain, and pleasing myself with it. I'm foaming at the mouth, but bring me some little doll, give me some tea with a bit of sugar, and maybe I'll calm down. I'll even wax tenderhearted, though afterwards I'll certainly gnash my teeth at myself and suffer from insomnia for a few months out of shame. Such is my custom.","I have been living like this for a long time now – about twenty years. I am forty. I once used to work in the government service but I don’t now. I was a bad civil servant. I was rude, and I enjoyed being rude. After all, I didn’t take bribes, so I had to have some compensation. (A poor witticism; but I won’t cross it out. When I wrote it down, I thought it would seem very pointed: now, when I see that I was simply trying to be clever and cynical, I shall leave it in on purpose.) When people used to come to the desk where I sat, asking for information, I snarled at them, and was hugely delighted when I succeeded in hurting somebody’s feelings. I almost always did succeed. They were mostly timid people – you know what people looking for favours are like. But among the swaggerers there was one officer I simply couldn’t stand. He absolutely refused to be intimidated, and he made a disgusting clatter with his sword. I carried on a campaign against him for eighteen months over that sword. I won in the end. He stopped making a clatter with it. This, however, was when I was still young. But do you know what was the real point of my bad temper? The main point, and the supreme nastiness, lay in the fact that even at my moments of greatest spleen, I was constantly and shamefully aware that not only was I not seething with fury , I was not even angry; I was simply scaring sparrows for my own amusement. I might be foaming at the mouth, but bring me some sort of toy to play with, or a nice sweet cup of tea, and I would calm down and even be stirred to the depths, although I would probably turn on myself afterwards, and suffer from insomnia for months. That was always my way.","I have been going on like that for a long time—twenty years. Now I am forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was a spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on purpose!) When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I sat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making anybody unhappy. I almost did succeed. For the most part they were all timid people—of course, they were petitioners. But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not endure. He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off clanking it. That happened in my youth, though. But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite? Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame for months after. That was my way."

"Их не только никого не было, но я даже едва отыскал нашу комнату. На столе было еще не совсем накрыто. Что же это значило? После многих расспросов я добился наконец от слуг, что обед заказан к шести часам, а не к пяти. Это подтвердили и в буфете. Даже стыдно стало расспрашивать. Было еще только двадцать пять минут шестого. Если они переменили час, то во всяком случае должны же были известить; на то городская почта, а не подвергать меня «позору» и перед собой и… и хоть перед слугами. Я сел; слуга стал накрывать; при нем стало как-то еще обиднее. К шести часам, кроме горевших ламп, в комнату внесены были свечи. Слуга не подумал, однако ж, внести их тотчас же, как я приехал. В соседней комнате обедали, на разных столах, два какие-то мрачных посетителя, сердитые с виду и молчавшие. В одной из дальних комнат было очень шумно; даже кричали; слышен был хохот целой ватаги людей; слышались какие-то скверные французские взвизги: обед был с дамами. Одним словом, было очень тошно. Редко я проводил более скверную минуту, так что когда они, ровно в шесть часов, явились все разом, я, на первый миг, обрадовался им как каким-то освободителям и чуть не забыл, что обязан смотреть обиженным.","Not only was there no one there, but I could hardly even find our room. The table was not yet completely covered. What did that mean? After many inquiries, I finally got from the servants that dinner was ordered for six o'clock, and not for five. This was also confirmed at the buffet. It was embarrassing to even ask. It was still only twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed the hour, then in any case they should have notified; that's what the city post office is for, and not expose me to ""shame"" in front of myself and ... and at least in front of the servants. I sat down; the servant began to cover; with him it became somehow even more embarrassing. By six o'clock, in addition to burning lamps, candles were brought into the room. The servant did not think, however, to bring them in as soon as I arrived. In the next room, two gloomy visitors, angry in appearance and silent, were having lunch, on different tables. It was very noisy in one of the far rooms; even shouted; the laughter of a whole gang of people was heard; some nasty French shrieks were heard: dinner was with the ladies. In a word, it was very boring. Rarely did I spend a more wretched minute, so that when they all appeared at once at exactly six o'clock, I, for the first moment, rejoiced at them as some kind of liberators and almost forgot that I was obliged to look offended.","Not only were none of them there, but I even had difficulty finding our room. The table was not quite laid yet. What did it mean? After much questioning, I finally got out of the waiters that the dinner had been ordered for six o'clock, not five. This was confirmed in the bar. I was even ashamed to be asking. It was only five twenty-five. If they had changed the time, they ought in any case to have informed me; that's what the city mail is for; and not to have subjected me to “disgrace” both in my own and . . . be it only the waiters' eyes. I sat down; a waiter began laying the table; in his presence it felt somehow still more offensive. By six o'clock, in addition to the lighted lamps, candles were brought into the room. It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them when I arrived. In the next room two customers, gloomy, angry-looking, and silent, were having dinner at separate tables. In one of the farther rooms it was very noisy; there was even shouting; the guffaws of a whole bunch of people could be heard; some nasty French squeals could be heard: it was a dinner with ladies. Quite nauseating, in short. Rarely have I spent a nastier moment, so that when, at exactly six o'clock, they all came in together, I was glad of them for the first moment as of some sort of deliverers, and almost forgot that I ought to look offended.","Not only was none of them there, but it was hardly possible to find our room. The table was not yet properly laid. What did this mean? After many inquiries I managed to discover from the servants that the dinner had been ordered for six o’clock, not five. The waiters in the bar confirmed this. I felt ashamed at having to ask. It was still only twenty-five minutes to six. If they had changed the time, they ought at least to have let me know – that was what the post was for, wasn’t it? – and not subjected me to this indignity in my own eyes and other people’s, even if it was only the servants’. I sat down; a servant began to lay the table; somehow his presence made me feel even more humiliated. At six o’clock candles were brought in, in addition to the lamps which were already lit. It had not occurred to the man to bring them in as soon as I arrived. In the next room, two of the hotel guests, gloomy, angry-looking, silent, were dining at separate tables. There was a great deal of noise in one of the other rooms, further away; some shouting, even, the noisy laughter of a whole mob of people, and some nasty French-sounding screams; ‘ladies’ were being entertained. In short, everything was sickening. I have seldom lived through worse moments, and so when the others arrived in a body at exactly six o’clock, they seemed like rescuers and I was so delighted to see them that at first I almost forgot to look offended.","Not only were they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know—that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. Towards six o’clock they brought in candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment."
Из той же поэзии,from the same poetry,From the same poetry,"I stood before her, crushed, discredited, foully covered with confusion, smiling, I think, and straining the skirts of my ragged wadded dressing-gown round me – in fact exactly as I had pictured myself in my depression a little earlier.","I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I believe I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my ragged wadded dressing-gown—exactly as I had imagined the scene not long before in a fit of depression."

But seven of them had to be paid tomorrow, a monthly salary, to Apollo, my servant, who lived with me for seven rubles on his grub.","And there was even a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money.

"Зверков вошел впереди всех, видимо предводительствуя. И он и все они смеялись; но, увидя меня, Зверков приосанился, подошел неторопливо, несколько перегибаясь в талье, точно кокетничая, и подал мне руку, ласково, но не очень, с какой-то осторожной, чуть не генеральской вежливостию, точно, подавая руку, оберегал себя от чего-то. Я воображал, напротив, что он, тотчас же как войдет, захохочет своим прежним хохотом, тоненьким и со взвизгами, и с первых же слов пойдут плоские его шутки и остроты. К ним-то я и готовился еще с вечера, но никак уж не ожидал я такого свысока, такой превосходительной ласки. Стало быть, он уж вполне считал себя теперь неизмеримо выше меня во всех отношениях? Если б он только обидеть меня хотел этим генеральством, то ничего еще, думал я; я бы как-нибудь там отплевался. Но что, если и в самом деле, без всякого желанья обидеть, в его баранью башку серьезно заползла идейка, что он неизмеримо выше меня и может на меня смотреть не иначе, как только с покровительством? От одного этого предположения я уже стал задыхаться.","Zverkov entered ahead of everyone, apparently leading them. And he and they all laughed; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew himself up, approached unhurriedly, somewhat bending over at the waist, as if flirting, and gave me his hand, affectionately, but not very, with some kind of cautious, almost general politeness, as if, by holding out his hand, he was protecting himself from what -then. I imagined, on the contrary, that as soon as he entered, he would begin to laugh with his former laughter, thin and with squeals, and from the very first words his flat jokes and witticisms would start. I had been preparing for them since the evening, but I certainly did not expect such a haughty, such an excellent caress. So, he already fully considered himself now immeasurably superior to me in all respects? If he only wanted to offend me with this generalship, then nothing else, I thought; I would spit there somehow. But what if, in fact, without any desire to offend, the idea seriously crept into his sheep's head that he is immeasurably higher than me and can look at me only with patronage? From one of this assumption I already began to suffocate.","Zverkov came at the head of them, obviously the leader. Both he and they were laughing; but on seeing me Zverkov assumed a dignified air, approached unhurriedly, bending slightly, as if coquettishly, at the waist, and gave me his hand benignly, but not very, with a certain cautious, almost senatorial politeness, as if by offering me his hand he were protecting himself from something. I had been imagining, on the contrary, that as soon as he walked in he would start laughing his former laugh, shrill, punctuated by little shrieks, and from the first there would be his flat jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing myself for them since the previous evening, but I by no means expected such down-the-nose, such excellential benignity. So he now fully considered himself immeasurably superior to me in all respects? If he simply wanted to offend me with this senatorial air, it was not so bad , I thought; I'd be able to get back at him somehow. But what if indeed, without any wish to offend me, the little idea had seriously crept into his sheep's noddle that he was immeasurably superior to me, and could look at me in no other way than patronizingly? The supposition alone left me breathless.","Zverkov, evidently playing the leader, came in at the head of them. He and all the others were laughing, but when he saw me Zverkov assumed a dignified air and came towards me, without hurrying, and, rather self-consciously leaning forward from the waist, gave me his hand in a friendly but not effusive fashion, almost with the careful courtesy of a very distinguished personage, as if he were protecting himself from something by offering me his hand. I, on the other hand, had been expecting him to begin laughing his old thin tinkling laugh and cracking his flat-footed jokes and witticisms as soon as he came in. I had been preparing myself for them ever since the day before and was not in the least expecting such lofty and condescending politeness. So he already considered himself so immeasurably my superior in every respect? It wouldn’t have mattered, I thought, if he had simply intended his condescension to be offensive; somehow or other I would have shrugged it off. But what if in fact, without any desire to be obnoxious, he had in all seriousness got it into his stupid mutton-head that he was immeasurably above me and could not see me in any other light than as the object of patronage? The very supposition made me breathless with indignation.","Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought—I could pay him back for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way? The very supposition made me gasp."
"Но неужели, неужели вы и в самом деле до того легковесны, что воображаете, будто я это все напечатаю да еще вам дам читать?

"— Для чего ты ко мне пришла, скажи ты мне, пожалуйста? — начал я, задыхаясь и даже не соображаясь с логическим порядком в моих словах.

I wanted to say everything at once, in one gulp; I didn't even care where to start.","“What did you come to me for, do tell me, please?” I began, suffocating, and not even considering the logical order of my words. I wanted to speak everything out at once, in one shot; I didn't even care where I began.","‘Why did you come here? Tell me that, if you please!’ I began, choking with anger and not even trying to preserve the logical order of my words. I wanted to get it all out in one volley; I didn’t even bother about where to begin.","“Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?” I began, gasping for breath and regardless of logical connection in my words.

"Я и не понял, что она нарочно маскировалась в насмешку, что это обыкновенная последняя уловка стыдливых и целомудренных сердцем людей, которым грубо и навязчиво лезут в душу и которые до последней минуты не сдаются от гордости и боятся перед вами высказать свое чувство. Уже по робости, с которой она приступала, в несколько приемов, к своей насмешке, и наконец только решилась высказать, я бы должен был догадаться.

The very timidity with which she ventured on her mockery, the several attempts before she succeeded at last in making herself express it, ought to have enabled me to guess. But I did not guess, and my heart brimmed over with spite.","I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of me."

"В голове был угар. Что-то как будто носилось надо мной и меня задевало, возбуждало и беспокоило. Тоска и желчь снова накипали и искали исхода.

"Ведь у людей, умеющих за себя отомстить и вообще за себя постоять, — как это, например, делается? Ведь их как обхватит, положим, чувство мести, так уж ничего больше во всем их существе на это время и не останется, кроме этого чувства. Такой господин так и прет прямо к цели, как взбесившийся бык, наклонив вниз рога, и только разве стена его останавливает. (Кстати: перед стеной такие господа, то есть непосредственные люди и деятели, искренно пасуют. Для них стена — не отвод, как например для нас, людей думающих, а следственно, ничего не делающих; не предлог воротиться с дороги, предлог, в который наш брат обыкновенно и сам не верит, но которому всегда очень рад. Нет, они пасуют со всею искренностью. Стена имеет для них что-то успокоительное, нравственно-разрешающее и окончательное, пожалуй, даже что-то мистическое… Но об стене после). Ну-с, такого-то вот непосредственного человека я и считаю настоящим, нормальным человеком, каким хотела его видеть сама нежная мать — природа, любезно зарождая его на земле. Я такому человеку до крайней желчи завидую. Он глуп, я в этом с вами не спорю, но, может быть, нормальный человек и должен быть глуп, почему вы знаете? Может быть, это даже очень красиво. И я тем более убежден в злом, так сказать, подозрении, что если, например, взять антитез нормального человека, то есть человека усиленно сознающего, вышедшего, конечно, не из лона природы, а из реторты (это уже почти мистицизм, господа, но я подозреваю и это), то этот ретортный человек до того иногда пасует перед своим антитезом, что сам себя, со всем своим усиленным сознанием, добросовестно считает за мышь, а не за человека. Пусть это и усиленно сознающая мышь, но все-таки мышь, а тут человек, а следственно… и проч. И, главное, он сам, сам ведь считает себя за мышь; его об этом никто не просит; а это важный пункт. Взглянем же теперь на эту мышь в действии. Положим, например, она тоже обижена (а она почти всегда бывает обижена) и тоже желает отомстить. Злости-то в ней, может, еще и больше накопится, чем в l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité.{3} Гадкое, низкое желаньице воздать обидчику тем же злом, может, еще и гаже скребется в ней, чем в l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité, потому что l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité, по своей врожденной глупости, считает свое мщенье просто-запросто справедливостью; а мышь, вследствие усиленного сознания, отрицает тут справедливость. Доходит наконец до самого дела, до самого акта отмщения. Несчастная мышь кроме одной первоначальной гадости успела уже нагородить кругом себя, в виде вопросов и сомнений, столько других гадостей; к одному вопросу подвела столько неразрешенных вопросов, что поневоле кругом нее набирается какая-то роковая бурда, какая-то вонючая грязь, состоящая из ее сомнений, волнений и, наконец, из плевков, сыплющихся на нее от непосредственных деятелей, предстоящих торжественно кругом в виде судей и диктаторов и хохочущих над нею во всю здоровую глотку. Разумеется, ей остается махнуть на все своей лапкой и с улыбкой напускного презренья, которому и сама она не верит, постыдно проскользнуть в свою щелочку. Там, в своем мерзком, вонючем подполье, наша обиженная, прибитая и осмеянная мышь немедленно погружается в холодную, ядовитую и, главное, вековечную злость. Сорок лет сряду будет припоминать до последних, самых постыдных подробностей свою обиду и при этом каждый раз прибавлять от себя подробности еще постыднейшие, злобно поддразнивая и раздражая себя собственной фантазией. Сама будет стыдиться своей фантазии, но все-таки все припомнит, все переберет, навыдумает на себя небывальщины, под предлогом, что она тоже могла случиться, и ничего не простит. Пожалуй, и мстить начнет, но как-нибудь урывками, мелочами, из-за печки, инкогнито, не веря ни своему праву мстить, ни успеху своего мщения и зная наперед, что от всех своих попыток отомстить сама выстрадает во сто раз больше того, кому мстит, а тот, пожалуй, и не почешется. На смертном одре опять-таки все припомнит, с накопившимися за все время процентами и… Но именно вот в этом холодном, омерзительном полуотчаянии, полувере, в этом сознательном погребении самого себя заживо с горя, в подполье на сорок лет, в этой усиленно созданной и все-таки отчасти сомнительной безвыходности своего положения, во всем этом яде неудовлетворенных желаний, вошедших внутрь, во всей этой лихорадке колебаний, принятых навеки решений и через минуту опять наступающих раскаяний — и заключается сок того странного наслаждения, о котором я говорил. Оно до того тонкое, до того иногда не поддающееся сознанью, что чуть-чуть ограниченные люди или даже просто люди с крепкими нервами не поймут в нем ни единой черты. «Может, еще и те не поймут, — прибавите вы от себя, осклабляясь, — которые никогда не получали пощечин», — и таким образом вежливо намекнете мне, что я в мою жизнь, может быть, тоже испытал пощечину, а потому и говорю как знаток. Бьюсь об заклад, что вы это думаете. Но успокойтесь, господа, я не получал пощечин, хотя мне совершенно все равно, как бы вы об этом ни думали. Я, может быть, еще сам-то жалею, что в мою жизнь мало роздал пощечин. Но довольно, ни слова больше об этой чрезвычайно для вас интересной теме.","After all, for people who know how to avenge themselves and stand up for themselves in general, how is this done, for example? After all, as they are embraced, let's say, by a feeling of revenge, so nothing more will remain in their entire being for this time, except for this feeling. Such a gentleman rushes straight to the goal, like a mad bull, tilting his horns down, and only if the wall stops him. (By the way: before the wall, such gentlemen, that is, direct people and leaders, sincerely give in. For them, the wall is not a diversion, as, for example, for us, people who think, and therefore do nothing; it is not an excuse to return from the road, an excuse in which our brother usually does not believe himself, but he is always very glad to him. No, they give in with all sincerity. The wall has for them something soothing, morally resolving and final, perhaps even something mystical ... But about the wall later) . Well, I consider such and such a direct person to be a real, normal person, as the tender mother nature herself wanted to see him, kindly giving birth to him on earth. I envy this man to the extreme. He is stupid, I do not argue with you on this, but maybe a normal person should be stupid, how do you know? Maybe it's even very beautiful. And I am all the more convinced of the evil, so to speak, suspicion that if, for example, we take the antithesis of a normal person, that is, a person who is intensely conscious, who, of course, came out not from the bosom of nature, but from a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect that too), then this retorted person sometimes succumbs before his antithesis to such an extent that he conscientiously considers himself, with all his heightened consciousness, to be a mouse, and not a man. Let this be a strongly conscious mouse, but still a mouse, and here is a man, and consequently ... and so on. And, most importantly, he himself, after all, considers himself a mouse; no one asks him about it; and this is an important point. Let's take a look at this mouse in action. Suppose, for example, she is also offended (and she is almost always offended) and also wants to take revenge. Perhaps even more anger accumulates in her than in l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité.{3} l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité, because l'homme de la nature et de la vèrité, in its innate stupidity, considers its vengeance to be simply justice; and the mouse, as a result of heightened consciousness, denies justice here. It comes at last to the very deed, to the very act of vengeance. The unfortunate mouse, in addition to one initial nasty thing, has already managed to pile up around itself, in the form of questions and doubts, so many other nasty things; has brought so many unresolved questions to one question that involuntarily some fatal scum is gathering around her, some stinking mud, consisting of her doubts, worries, and, finally, of spitting pouring down on her from direct figures, coming solemnly around in the form judges and dictators and laughing at her at the top of their lungs. Of course, it remains for her to give up on everything with her paw and with a smile of feigned contempt, which she herself does not believe, it is shameful to slip into her crack. There, in his vile, smelly underground, our offended, beaten and ridiculed mouse immediately plunges into cold, poisonous and, most importantly, eternal anger. For forty years in a row he will remember his offense to the last, most shameful details, and at the same time, each time he will add even more shameful details from himself, maliciously teasing and irritating himself with his own imagination. She herself will be ashamed of her fantasy, but all the same she will remember everything, go over everything, invent unheard-of things about herself, under the pretext that it could also happen, and she will not forgive anything. Perhaps she will begin to take revenge, but somehow in fits and starts, in small ways, from behind the stove, incognito, not believing either her right to take revenge, or the success of her revenge, and knowing in advance that she herself will suffer a hundred times more from all her attempts to take revenge, who takes revenge, and he, perhaps, will not scratch himself. On his deathbed, he will again remember everything, with the interest accumulated over all the time and... all the same, partly of the dubious hopelessness of one’s position, in all this poison of unsatisfied desires that have entered inside, in all this fever of hesitation, decisions taken forever and a minute later repentance comes again - and there is the juice of that strange pleasure that I spoke about. It is so subtle, so sometimes not amenable to consciousness, that slightly limited people, or even just people with strong nerves, will not understand a single feature in it. “Perhaps even those will not understand,” you add on your own, grinning, “who have never received slaps in the face,” and in this way you will politely hint to me that in my life, perhaps, I also experienced a slap in the face, and therefore I say like a connoisseur. I bet what you think. But calm down, gentlemen, I did not receive slaps, although I do not care at all, no matter how you think about it. Perhaps I still regret myself that I have given so few slaps in the face in my life. But enough, not a word more about this extremely interesting topic for you.","What happens, for example, with people who know how to take revenge and generally how to stand up for themselves? Once they are overcome, say, by vengeful feeling, then for the time there is simply nothing left in their whole being but this feeling. Such a gentleman just lunges straight for his goal like an enraged bull, horns lowered, and maybe only a wall can stop him. (Incidentally: before a wall, these gentlemen – that is, ingenuous people and active figures – quite sincerely fold. For them a wall is not a deflection, as it is, for example, for us, people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not a pretext for turning back, a pretext which our sort usually doesn't believe in but is always very glad to have. No, they fold in all sincerity. For them a wall possesses something soothing, morally resolving and final, perhaps even something mystical . . . But of the wall later.) Well, sirs, it is just such an ingenuous man that I regard as the real, normal man, the way his tender mother – nature – herself wished to see him when she so kindly conceived him on earth. I envy such a man to the point of extreme bile. He is stupid, I won't argue with you about that, but perhaps a normal man ought to be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it's even very beautiful. And I am the more convinced of this, so to speak, suspicion, seeing that if, for example, one takes the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of heightened consciousness, who came, of course, not from the bosom of nature but from a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect that, too), this retort man sometimes folds before his antithesis so far that he honestly regards himself, with all his heightened consciousness, as a mouse and not a man. A highly conscious mouse, perhaps, but a mouse all the same, whereas here we have a man, and consequently . . . and so on . . . And, above all, it is he, he himself, who regards himself as a mouse; no one asks him to; and that is an important point. Let us now have a look at this mouse in action. Suppose, for example, that it, too, is offended (and it is almost always offended), and it, too, wishes to take revenge. For it may have stored up even more spite than l'homme de la nature et de la verité.[5] The nasty, base little desire to pay the offender back with the same evil may scratch still more nastily in it than in l'homme de la nature et de la verité, because l'homme de le nature et de la verité, with his innate stupidity, regards his revenge quite simply as justice; whereas the mouse, as a result of its heightened consciousness, denies it any justice. Things finally come down to the business itself, to the act of revenge itself. The wretched mouse, in addition to the one original nastiness, has already managed to fence itself about with so many other nastinesses in the form of questions and doubts; it has padded out the one question with so many unresolved questions that, willy-nilly, some fatal slops have accumulated around it, some stinking filth consisting of its dubieties, anxieties, and, finally, of the spit raining on it from the ingenuous figures who stand solemnly around it like judges and dictators, guffawing at it from all their healthy gullets. Of course, nothing remains for it but to wave the whole thing aside with its little paw and, with a smile of feigned contempt, in which it does not believe itself, slip back shamefacedly into its crack. There, in its loathsome, stinking underground, our offended, beaten-down, and derided mouse at once immerses itself in cold, venomous, and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years on end it will recall its offense to the last, most shameful details, each time adding even more shameful details of its own, spitefully taunting and chafing itself with its fantasies. It will be ashamed of its fantasies, but all the same it will recall everything, go over everything, heap all sorts of figments on itself, under the pretext that they, too, could have happened, and forgive nothing. It may even begin to take revenge, but somehow in snatches, with piddling things, from behind the stove, incognito, believing neither in its right to revenge itself nor in the success of its vengeance, and knowing beforehand that it will suffer a hundred times more from all its attempts at revenge than will the object of its vengeance, who will perhaps not even scratch at the bite. On its deathbed it will again recall everything, adding the interest accumulated over all that time, and . . . But it is precisely in this cold, loathsome half-despair, half-belief, in this conscious burying oneself alive from grief for forty years in the underground, in this assiduously produced and yet somewhat dubious hopelessness of one's position, in all this poison of unsatisfied desires penetrating inward, in all this fever of hesitations, of decisions taken forever, and repentances coming again a moment later, that the very sap of that strange pleasure I was talking about consists. It is so subtle, sometimes so elusive of consciousness, that people who are even the slightest bit narrow-minded, or who simply have strong nerves, will not understand a single trace of it. ”Perhaps ,” you will add, grinning, “those who have never been slapped will also not understand” – thereby politely hinting that I, too, may have experienced a slap in my life, and am therefore speaking as a connoisseur. I'll bet that's what you think. But calm yourselves, gentlemen, I have not received any slaps, though it's all quite the same to me whatever you may think about it. Perhaps I myself am sorry for having dealt out too few slaps in my life. But enough, not another word on this subject which you find so extremely interesting.","Those people, for example, who can avenge their wrongs and generally stand up for themselves – how do they do it? They seem to be so possessed by the desire for, say, revenge that for the time there is nothing left in their whole being but that emotion. A man like that goes straight for his goal like a mad bull charging with his horns down, and is to be stopped, if at all, only by a stone wall. (By the way, men like that, men of action, doers, quite genuinely give up when faced with a wall; to them a wall is not a challenge, as it is to us, for example, men who think and therefore don’t do anything; nor is it an excuse for turning aside, an excuse that people like us are always glad of, even if we don’t usually even believe in it ourselves. No, they give up in all sincerity. A wall is for them something calming, morally decisive and final, perhaps even something mystical…. But I’ll come back to the wall later.) Well, that sort of spontaneous man is the real man, as Nature his tender mother, lovingly bringing him to birth upon the earth, would wish to see him. I am green with envy of such men. They are stupid, I won’t deny that, but perhaps a normal man ought to be stupid, how can you tell? Perhaps it is even a very fine thing to be. I am even more convinced that this suspicion, so to speak, of mine is true by the fact that if one takes the antithesis of the normal man, for example, the man of heightened awareness, who has of course emerged not from the womb of Nature but from a test-tube (this is almost mysticism, but that is a thing I distrust too) – the test-tube man will sometimes give up so completely when confronted by his antithesis that he will honestly look upon himself, with all his sharpened consciousness, as a mouse, not a man. A highly conscious mouse, but all the same a mouse, while the other is a man, and consequently… and so on. And the point is that he looks on himself as a mouse of his own accord; nobody asks him to do so; that is the important thing. Let us now look at this mouse in action. Suppose, for example, that it too has been insulted (and it will almost always be subjected to slights) and desires revenge. Perhaps even more fury will accumulate inside it than inside l’homme de la nature et de la vérité. The nasty mean little desire to pay back the offender in his own coin may gnaw more viciously inside it than inside l’homme de la nature et de la vérité because l’homme de la nature et de la vérité, with his innate stupidity, considers his revenge to be no more than justice, while the mouse, with its heightened awareness, denies that there is any justice about it. At last comes the act itself, the revenge. The wretched mouse has by this time accumulated, in addition to the original nastiness, so many other nastinesses in the shape of questions and doubts, and so many other unresolved problems in addition to the original problem, that it has involuntarily collected round itself a fatal morass, a stinking bog, consisting of its own doubts and agitation, and finally of the spittle rained on it by all the spontaneous men of action standing portentously round as judges and referees, and howling with laughter. Of course, nothing remains for it to do but shrug the whole thing off and creep shamefacedly into its hole with a smile of pretended contempt in which it doesn’t even believe itself. There in its nasty stinking cellar our offended, browbeaten and derided mouse sinks at once into cold, venomous, and above all undying resentment. It will sit there for forty years together remembering the insult in the minutest and most shameful detail and constantly adding even more shameful details of its own invention, maliciously tormenting and fretting itself with its own imagination. It will be ashamed of its fantasies, but all the same it will always be remembering them and turning them over in its mind, inventing things that never happened because they might have done so, and forgiving nothing. Perhaps it will even begin to take its revenge, but somehow in little bits, in snatches, furtively, anonymously, not believing either in its right to revenge itself or in its success in doing so, and knowing in advance that it will suffer a hundred times more painfully from every one of its attempts at revenge than the victims of them, who will perhaps never even notice them. On its deathbed it will recall the whole thing over again, with compound interest, and…. But it is precisely this cold, sickening half-despair, half-hope, this deliberately burying oneself in a cellar for forty years out of spite, this well-established and yet somehow unconvincing powerlessness to escape from the situation, all this poisonous accumulation of unsatisfied wishes in the breast, all these feverish vacillations, all these resolutions firmly taken for all time and repented of again after a few minutes, that give rise to and nourish that strange pleasure I was speaking of. It is so subtle, and sometimes so little subject to the conscious mind, that slightly limited people, or sometimes simply those whose nervous systems are stable, will not understand the least thing about it. ‘ Perhaps,’ you will put in with a grin, ‘nobody who hasn’t had a slap in the face will be able to understand either’, thus politely hinting that perhaps I myself have suffered a slap in the face at some time in my life, and therefore speak from experience. I’m prepared to bet that is what you think. But don’t worry, I haven’t experienced any slaps, though it makes absolutely no difference to me what you think on the subject. Perhaps I am even a little sorry that I have dealt out so few slaps myself. But that’s enough; not another word on this subject you find so extraordinarily interesting.","With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way: facing the wall, such gentlemen—that is, the “direct” persons and men of action—are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion, as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something tranquillising, morally soothing, final—maybe even something mysterious ... but of the wall later.) Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et caetera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an important point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in l’homme de la nature et de la vérité. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in l’homme de la nature et de la vérité. For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the years and ... But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of it. “Possibly,” you will add on your own account with a grin, “people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you."
"Бедненькая, она хранила письмо этого студента как драгоценность и сбегала за этой единственной своей драгоценностью, не желая, чтоб я ушел, не узнав о том, что и ее любят честно и искренно, что и с ней говорят почтительно. Наверно, этому письму так и суждено было пролежать в шкатулке без последствий. Но все равно; я уверен, что она всю жизнь его хранила бы как драгоценность, как гордость свою и свое оправдание, и вот теперь сама в такую минуту вспомнила и принесла это письмо, чтоб наивно погордиться передо мной, восстановить себя в моих глазах, чтоб и я видел, чтоб и я похвалил. Я ничего не сказал, пожал ей руку и вышел. Мне так хотелось уйти… Я прошел всю дорогу пешком, несмотря на то, что мокрый снег все еще валил хлопьями. Я был измучен, раздавлен, в недоумении.

Гадкая истина!","Poor thing, she kept this student's letter as a treasure and ran after this only treasure of hers, not wanting me to leave without knowing that she was also loved honestly and sincerely, that they spoke to her respectfully. Probably, this letter was destined to lie in the box without consequences. But still; I am sure that she would keep it all her life as a treasure, as her pride and her justification, and now she herself at such a moment remembered and brought this letter to be naively proud in front of me, to restore herself in my eyes, so that I could see, so that I can praise. I said nothing, shook her hand and left. I so wanted to leave... I walked all the way, despite the fact that the wet snow was still falling in flakes. I was exhausted, crushed, at a loss.

But what matter; I'm sure she would keep it all her life as a treasure, as her pride and justification, and now, at such a moment, she remembered the letter and brought it out to take naive pride before me, to restore herself in my eyes, so that I, too, should see, and I, too, should praise.

But none the less, I am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise herself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of her.

"Впрочем, что ж я? — все это делают; болезнями-то и тщеславятся, а я, пожалуй, и больше всех. Не будем спорить; мое возражение нелепо. Но все-таки я крепко убежден, что не только очень много сознания, но даже и всякое сознание болезнь. Я стою на том. Оставим и это на минуту. Скажите мне вот что: отчего так бывало, что, как нарочно, в те самые, да, в те же самые минуты, в которые я наиболее способен был сознавать все тонкости «всего прекрасного и высокого»,{2} как говорили у нас когда-то, мне случалось уже не сознавать, а делать такие неприглядные деянья, такие, которые… ну да, одним словом, которые хоть и все, пожалуй, делают, но которые, как нарочно, приходились у меня именно тогда, когда я наиболее сознавал, что их совсем бы не надо делать? Чем больше я сознавал о добре и о всем этом «прекрасном и высоком», тем глубже я и опускался в мою тину и тем способнее был совершенно завязнуть в ней. Но главная черта была в том, что все это как будто не случайно во мне было, а как будто ему и следовало так быть. Как будто это было мое самое нормальное состояние, а отнюдь не болезнь и не порча, так что, наконец, у меня и охота прошла бороться с этой порчей. Кончилось тем, что я чуть не поверил (а может, и в самом деле поверил), что это, пожалуй, и есть нормальное мое состояние. А сперва-то, вначале-то, сколько я муки вытерпел в этой борьбе! Я не верил, чтоб так бывало с другими, и потому всю жизнь таил это про себя как секрет. Я стыдился (даже, может быть, и теперь стыжусь); до того доходил, что ощущал какое-то тайное, ненормальное, подленькое наслажденьице возвращаться, бывало, в иную гадчайшую петербургскую ночь к себе в угол и усиленно сознавать, что вот и сегодня сделал опять гадость, что сделанного опять-таки никак не воротишь, и внутренно, тайно, грызть, грызть себя за это зубами, пилить и сосать себя до того, что горечь обращалась наконец в какую-то позорную, проклятую сладость и наконец — в решительное, серьезное наслаждение! Да, в наслаждение, в наслаждение! Я стою на том. Я потому и заговорил, что мне все хочется наверно узнать: бывают ли у других такие наслаждения? Я вам объясню: наслаждение было тут именно от слишком яркого сознания своего унижения; оттого, что уж сам чувствуешь, что до последней стены дошел; что и скверно это, но что и нельзя тому иначе быть; что уж нет тебе выхода, что уж никогда не сделаешься другим человеком; что если б даже и оставалось еще время и вера, чтоб переделаться во что-нибудь другое, то, наверно, сам бы не захотел переделываться; а захотел бы, так и тут бы ничего не сделал, потому что на самом-то деле и переделываться-то, может быть, не во что. А главное и конец концов, что все это происходит по нормальным и основным законам усиленного сознания и по инерции, прямо вытекающей из этих законов, а следственно, тут не только не переделаешься, да и просто ничего не поделаешь. Выходит, например, вследствие усиленного сознания: прав, что подлец, как будто это подлецу утешение, коль он уже сам ощущает, что он действительно подлец. Но довольно… Эх, нагородил-то, а что объяснил?.. Чем объясняется тут наслаждение? Но я объяснюсь! Я-таки доведу до конца! Я и перо затем в руки взял…","However, what am I? - everyone does it; illnesses and conceited, and I, perhaps, more than anyone else. Let's not argue; my objection is ridiculous. But still, I am firmly convinced that not only is there a lot of consciousness, but even all consciousness is a disease. I stand on it. Let's leave that for a minute. Tell me this: why did it happen that, as if on purpose, in those very, yes, in those very minutes, in which I was most able to recognize all the subtleties of ""everything beautiful and lofty"", {2} as we used to say when something, I happened to no longer be conscious, but to do such unsightly deeds, such that ... well, yes, in a word, which, although everyone, perhaps, does, but which, as if on purpose, occurred to me precisely at the time when I was most conscious of that they shouldn't be done at all? The more I was conscious of the good and of all this “beautiful and lofty”, the deeper I sank into my mire and the more able I was to get completely bogged down in it. But the main feature was that all this seemed not to be accidental in me, but as if it should have been so. As if it was my most normal state, and by no means a disease or corruption, so that, finally, I had no desire to fight this corruption. I ended up almost believing (or maybe I really believed) that this, perhaps, is my normal state. But at first, at the beginning, how much torment I endured in this struggle! I did not believe that this happened to others, and therefore kept it to myself as a secret all my life. I was ashamed (perhaps even now I am ashamed); I got to the point where I felt some kind of secret, abnormal, petty pleasure to come back to my corner on some nastiest night in St. Petersburg and intensely realize that today I’ve done something disgusting again, that you can’t turn back what you’ve done, and inwardly, secretly, to gnaw, to gnaw at oneself for it with one's teeth, to nag and suck oneself to such an extent that the bitterness finally turned into some kind of shameful, accursed sweetness, and finally into a resolute, serious pleasure! Yes, enjoy, enjoy! I stand on it. That's why I started talking because I always want to know for sure: do others have such pleasures? I'll explain to you: the pleasure was here precisely from the too vivid consciousness of one's humiliation; because you yourself feel that you have reached the last wall; that this is bad, but that it cannot be otherwise; that there is no way out for you, that you will never become another person; that even if there were still time and faith to change into something else, then, probably, he himself would not want to change; but if he wanted to, he wouldn’t have done anything here either, because in reality there’s nothing to be changed into, perhaps. And the main thing and the end of all is that all this happens according to the normal and basic laws of heightened consciousness and by inertia, which directly follows from these laws, and consequently, not only can not be changed, but simply nothing can be done. It turns out, for example, as a result of heightened consciousness: he is right that he is a scoundrel, as if this is a consolation for the scoundrel, since he himself already feels that he is really a scoundrel. But enough... Oh, he piled up something, but what did he explain? .. What explains the pleasure here? But I will explain! I will finish it! Then I took the pen in my hands ...","Though – what am I saying? – everyone does it; it's their sicknesses that everyone takes pride in, and I, perhaps, more than anyone. Let us not argue; my objection was absurd. But all the same I am strongly convinced that not only too much consciousness but even any consciousness at all is a sickness. I stand upon it. But let us also leave that for a moment. Tell me this: why was it that, as if by design, in those same, yes, in those very same moments when I was most capable of being conscious of all the refinements of “everything beautiful and lofty,”[4] as we once used to say, it happened that instead of being conscious I did such unseemly deeds, such deeds as . . . well, in short, as everyone does, perhaps, but which with me occurred, as if by design, precisely when I was most conscious that I ought not to be doing them at all? The more conscious I was of the good and of all this “beautiful and lofty,” the deeper I kept sinking into my mire, and the more capable I was of getting completely stuck in it. But the main feature was that this was all in me not as if by chance, but as if it had to be so. As if it were my most normal condition and in no way a sickness or a blight, so that finally I lost any wish to struggle against this blight. I ended up almost believing (and maybe indeed believing) that this perhaps was my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, how much torment I endured in this struggle! I did not believe that such things happened to others, and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret. I was ashamed (maybe I am ashamed even now); it reached the point with me where I would feel some secret, abnormal, mean little pleasure in returning to my corner on some most nasty Petersburg night and being highly conscious of having once again done a nasty thing that day, and again that what had been done could in no way be undone, and I would gnaw, gnaw at myself with my teeth, inwardly, secretly, tear and suck at myself until the bitterness finally turned into some shameful, accursed sweetness, and finally – into a decided, serious pleasure! Yes, a pleasure, a pleasure! I stand upon it. The reason I've begun to speak is that I keep wanting to find out for certain: do other people have such pleasures? I'll explain to you: the pleasure here lay precisely in the too vivid consciousness of one's own humiliation; in feeling that one had reached the ultimate wall; that, bad as it is, it cannot be otherwise; that there is no way out for you, that you will never change into a different person; that even if you had enough time and faith left to change yourself into something different, you probably would not wish to change; and even if you did wish it, you would still not do anything, because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change into. And chiefly, and finally, all this occurs according to the normal and basic laws of heightened consciousness and the inertia that follows directly from these laws, and consequently there is not only nothing you can do to change yourself, but there is simply nothing to do at all. So it turns out, for example, as a result of heightened consciousness: right, you're a scoundrel – as if it were a consolation for the scoundrel himself to feel that he is indeed a scoundrel. But enough . . . Eh, I've poured all that out, and what have I explained? . . . How explain this pleasure? But I will explain myself! I will carry through to the end! That is why I took a pen in my hands . . .","Why do I say that, though? Everybody does it – we all show off with our diseases, and I, perhaps, more than anybody. Don’t let’s argue; I expressed myself clumsily. But all the same I’m firmly convinced that not only a great deal, but every kind, of intellectual activity is a disease. I hold to that. Let us leave it for the moment. Tell me this: why is it that it always had to happen, as if on purpose, that in those moments, yes, in those very same moments, when I was most capable of recognizing all the subtle beauties of ‘the highest and the best’, as we used to say, I could not only fail to recognize them, but could actually do such ugly, repulsive things as… well, such things, in short, as perhaps everybody does, but which always happened to me, as if on purpose, when I was most conscious that I ought not to do them? The more aware I was of beauty and of ‘the highest and the best’, the deeper I sank into my slime, and the more capable I became of immersing myself completely in it. But the chief feature of all this was that it was not accidental, but as if it had to be so. It was as if this was my normal condition, not a disease or a festering sore in me, so that finally I lost even the desire to struggle against the spell. I ended by almost believing (or perhaps fully believing) that this was really my normal state. But before that, in the beginning, how much I suffered in the struggle! I didn’t believe the same thing could happen to other people, and so I have kept the secret to myself my whole life. I was ashamed (perhaps I am ashamed even now); I got to the point where I felt an abnormal, mean, secret stirring of pleasure in going back home to my corner from some debauched St Petersburg night, conscious in the highest degree that I had once again done something vile and that what was done could never be undone. And secretly, in my heart, I would gnaw and nibble and probe and suck away at myself until ""page_19"">the bitter taste turned at last into a kind of shameful, devilish sweetness and, finally, downright definite pleasure. Yes, pleasure, pleasure! I stand by that. The reason I have spoken of it is that I want to know for certain whether other people feel that kind of pleasure. Let me explain: the pleasure came precisely from being too clearly aware of your own degradation; from the feeling of having gone to the uttermost limits; that it was vile, but it could not have been otherwise; that you could not escape, you could never make yourself into a different person; that even if enough faith and time remained for you to make yourself into something different, you probably wouldn’t want to change yourself; and even if you did want to, you wouldn’t do anything because, after all, perhaps it wasn’t worth while to change. But finally, and chiefly, all this proceeded from the normal basic laws of intellectual activity and the inertia directly resulting from these laws, and consequently not only wouldn’t you change yourself, you wouldn’t even do anything at all. For example, it turns out in consequence of intensified awareness that it seems to be some kind of consolation to a scoundrel to feel fully conscious that he really is a scoundrel. But that’s enough…. Ach, I’ve talked a lot, but what have I explained? How can this pleasure be accounted for? But I will explain myself. I’ll go on to the end. That’s why I took up my pen…","But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger over them? Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone. We will not dispute it; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is “sublime and beautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more conscious I was of goodness and of all that was “sublime and beautiful,” the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to be so. It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into. And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness, that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he actually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be explained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That is why I have taken up my pen...."

"Угрюмая мысль зародилась в моем мозгу и прошла по всему телу каким-то скверным ощущением, похожим на то, когда входишь в подполье, сырое и затхлое. Как-то неестественно было, что именно только теперь эти два глаза вздумали меня начать рассматривать. Вспомнилось мне тоже, что в продолжение двух часов я не сказал с этим существом ни одного слова и совершенно не счел этого нужным; даже это мне давеча почему-то нравилось. Теперь же мне вдруг ярко представилась нелепая, отвратительная, как паук, идея разврата, который без любви, грубо и бесстыже, начинает прямо с того, чем настоящая любовь венчается. Мы долго смотрели так друг на друга, но глаз своих она перед моими не опускала и взгляду своего не меняла, так что мне стало наконец отчего-то жутко.","A gloomy thought originated in my brain and passed through my whole body with some kind of nasty feeling, similar to when you enter the underground, damp and musty. It was somehow unnatural that it was only now that these two eyes decided to begin to examine me. I also remembered that for two hours I did not say a single word to this creature and did not consider it necessary at all; For some reason I even liked this. Now, however, I suddenly vividly imagined the absurd, disgusting, like a spider, idea of debauchery, which, without love, rudely and shamelessly, begins directly with what true love is crowned with. We looked at each other like that for a long time, but she did not lower her eyes in front of mine and did not change her gaze, so that I finally felt terrified for some reason.","A sullen thought was born in my brain and passed through my whole body like some vile sensation, similar to what one feels on entering an underground cellar, damp and musty. It was somehow unnatural that these two eyes had only decided precisely now to begin peering at me. It also occurred to me that in the course of two hours I had not exchanged a single word with this being and had not considered it at all necessary; I had even liked it for some reason. But now, all of a sudden, there appeared before me the absurd, loathsomely spiderish notion of debauchery, which, without love, crudely and shamelessly begins straight off with that which is the crown of true love. We looked at each other like that for a long time, but she did not lower her eyes before mine, nor did she change their expression, and in the end, for some reason, this made me feel eerie.","A resentful feeling arose in my mind and swept through my body with something like the unpleasant sensation of going into a damp and musty cellar. It seemed somehow unnatural that it was only at this moment that those two eyes had decided to examine me. I remembered, too, that for two whole hours I had not spoken a single word to this being, or considered there was any need to do so; until a few moments before I had even felt pleased about it. But now, absurd and disgusting, like a spider, there rose before me suddenly and vividly the image of lust, which lovelessly, crudely, shamelessly, begins where true love finds its crown. We lay there for a long time looking at one another, but she did not lower her eyes or change her expression, and at last I was filled with an… eerie feeling.","A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar.

I recalled, too, that during those two hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea—revolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation. For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable."

"Раз, проходя ночью мимо одного трактиришка, я увидел в освещенное окно, как господа киями подрались у биллиарда и как одного из них в окно спустили.

"— Если таперича вам есть что мне приказать, то мое дело исполнить, — отвечал он, опять-таки помолчав, тихо и размеренно сюсюкая, подняв брови и спокойно перегнув голову с одного плеча на другое, — и все это с ужасающим спокойствием.","“If you have something to order me, then it’s my job to do it,” he answered, after another pause, quietly and measuredly lisping, raising his eyebrows and calmly bending his head from one shoulder to the other, “and all this with terrifying calmness.","“If there's something you want done directly, it's my duty to see to it,” he replied, again after some silence, lisping softly and measuredly, raising his eyebrows, and calmly shifting his head from one side to the other – and all that with horrifying composure.","‘If you have any orders for me just now, it is my business to carry them out,’ he replied after another silence, in his hushed, measured, hissing tones, raising his eyebrows and quietly changing the inclination of his head from left to right.","“If you have any order to give me it’s my duty to carry it out,” he answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another, all this with exasperating composure."
"О, если б я ничего не делал только из лени. Господи, как бы я тогда себя уважал. Уважал бы именно потому, что хоть лень я в состоянии иметь в себе; хоть одно свойство было бы во мне как будто и положительное, в котором я бы и сам был уверен. Вопрос: кто такой? Ответ: лентяй; да ведь это преприятно было бы слышать о себе. Значит, положительно определен, значит, есть что сказать обо мне. «Лентяй!» — да ведь это званье и назначенье, это карьера-с. Не шутите, это так. Я тогда член самого первейшего клуба по праву и занимаюсь только тем, что беспрерывно себя уважаю. Я знал господина, который всю жизнь гордился тем, что знал толк в лафите. Он считал это за положительное свое достоинство и никогда не сомневался в себе. Он умер не то что с покойной, а с торжествующей совестью, и был совершенно прав. А я бы себе тогда выбрал карьеру: а был бы лентяй и обжора, но не простой, а, например, сочувствующий всему прекрасному и высокому. Как вам это нравится? Мне это давно мерещилось. Это «прекрасное и высокое» сильно-таки задавило мне затылок в мои сорок лет; но это в мои сорок лет, а тогда — о, тогда было бы иначе! Я бы тотчас же отыскал себе и соответствующую деятельность, — а именно: пить за здоровье всего прекрасного и высокого. Я бы придирался ко всякому случаю, чтоб сначала пролить в свой бокал слезу, а потом выпить его за все прекрасное и высокое. Я бы все на свете обратил тогда в прекрасное и высокое; в гадчайшей, бесспорной дряни отыскал бы прекрасное и высокое. Я сделался бы слезоточив, как мокрая губка. Художник, например, написал картину Ге. Тотчас же пью за здоровье художника, написавшего картину Ге, потому что люблю все прекрасное и высокое. Автор написал «как кому угодно»;{8} тотчас же пью за здоровье «кого угодно», потому что люблю все «прекрасное и высокое». Уважения к себе за это потребую, преследовать буду того, кто не будет мне оказывать уважения. Живу спокойно, умираю торжественно, — да ведь это прелесть, целая прелесть! И такое себе отрастил бы я тогда брюхо, такой тройной подбородок соорудил, такой бы сандальный нос{9} себе выработал, что всякий встречный сказал бы, смотря на меня: «Вот так плюс! вот так уж настоящее положительное!» А ведь как хотите, такие отзывы преприятно слышать в наш отрицательный век, господа.","Oh, if only I didn't do anything out of laziness. God, how would I respect myself then. I would respect it precisely because at least I am able to have laziness in myself; at least one quality would seem to be positive in me, in which I myself would be sure. Question: who is this? Answer: lazy; Yes, it would be nice to hear about yourself. So, positively defined, so there is something to be said about me. ""Lazy person!"" - but this is a rank and appointment, this is a career, sir. Don't joke, it's true. I am then a member of the very first club by right and do only that which I constantly respect myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on the fact that he knew a lot about lafitte. He considered this to be his positive dignity and never doubted himself. He died not only with a dead, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was absolutely right. And then I would have chosen a career for myself: I would have been a lazy person and a glutton, but not a simple one, but, for example, one who sympathizes with everything beautiful and lofty. How do you like it? I've been dreaming of this for a long time. This ""beautiful and lofty"" really crushed the back of my head in my forties; but this is at my forty years old, and then - oh, then it would be different! I would immediately find for myself an appropriate activity, namely: to drink everything beautiful and lofty to health. I would find fault with every occasion, in order to first shed a tear into my glass, and then drink it for everything beautiful and lofty. I would then turn everything in the world into something beautiful and lofty; in the ugliest, indisputable rubbish, I would find the beautiful and lofty. I would become tearful, like a wet sponge. The artist, for example, painted a picture of Ge. I immediately drink to the health of the artist who painted the picture of Ge, because I love everything beautiful and lofty. The author wrote ""as anyone"";{8} I immediately drink to the health of ""anyone"", because I love everything ""beautiful and lofty"". I will demand respect for myself for this, I will persecute the one who will not show me respect. I live calmly, I die solemnly—but this is a charm, a whole charm! And then I would grow such a belly for myself, I would build such a triple chin, I would develop such a sandal nose {9} for myself that everyone would say, looking at me: “This is such a plus! this is so real positive!” But as you wish, it is pleasant to hear such reviews in our negative age, gentlemen.","Oh, if I were doing nothing only out of laziness. Lord, how I'd respect myself then. Respect myself precisely because I'd at least be capable of having laziness in me; there would be in me at least one, as it were, positive quality, which I myself could be sure of. Question: who is he? Answer: a lazybones. Now, it would be most agreeable to hear that about myself. It means I'm positively defined; it means there's something to say about me. ”Lazybones!” – now, that is a title and a mission, it's a career, sirs. No joking, it really is. By rights I'm then a member of the foremost club, and my sole occupation is ceaselessly respecting myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a fine judge of Lafite. He regarded it as his positive merit and never doubted himself. He died not merely with a serene but with a triumphant conscience, and he was perfectly right. And so I would choose a career for myself: I would be a lazybones and a glutton, and not just an ordinary one, but, for example, one sympathizing with everything beautiful and lofty. How do you like that? I've long been fancying it. This “beautiful and lofty” has indeed weighed heavy on my head in my forty years; but that's my forty years, while then – oh, then it would be different! I would at once find an appropriate activity for myself – namely, drinking the health of all that is beautiful and lofty. I would seize every occasion, first to shed a tear into my glass, and then to drink it for all that is beautiful and lofty. I would then turn everything in the world into the beautiful and lofty; in the vilest, most unquestionable trash I would discover the beautiful and lofty. I'd become as tearful as a sodden sponge. An artist, for example, has painted a Ge picture.[10 ] I immediately drink the health of the artist who has painted the Ge picture, because I love all that is beautiful and lofty. An author has written “as anyone pleases”;[11] I immediately drink the health of “anyone who pleases,” because I love all that is “beautiful and lofty.” For this I'll demand to be respected, I'll persecute whoever does not show me respect. I live peacefully , I die solemnly – why, this is charming, utterly charming! And I'd grow myself such a belly then , I'd fashion such a triple chin for myself, I'd fix myself up such a ruby nose that whoever came along would say, looking at me: “Now, there's a plus! There's a real positive!” And, think what you will, it's most agreeable to hear such comments in our negative age, gentlemen.","Oh, if only it was only out of laziness that I do nothing! Lord, how much I should respect myself then! I should respect myself because I had something inside me, even if it was only laziness; I should have at any rate one positive quality of which I could be sure. Question: what is he? Answer: a lazy man; and it really would be very pleasant to hear that said of me. It would mean being positively defined, it would mean that there was something that could be said of me. ‘ A lazy man!’ – that is a name, a calling, it’s positively a career! Don’t laugh, it’s true. Then I should be by right a member of the very best club, and have no other occupation than nursing my self-esteem. I once knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Chateau Lafite. He considered that to be his positive merit, and never doubted himself. He died not so much with a quiet as with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right. And I should choose for myself a career: I should be a lazy man and a glutton, but not a simple one, rather one who, for example, was in sympathy with all that is ‘best and highest’. How do you like that idea? It has often crossed my mind. That ‘best and highest’ is an absolute headache to me now at forty; but that is now that I am forty; then – oh, then would have been different! I should have found a suitable sphere of action for myself at once, namely drinking to the ‘best and highest’. I would have seized every opportunity of first dropping a tear into my glass and then draining it in honour of the best and highest; I would have sought out the best and highest in the nastiest, most unmistakable filth. I should have been as tearful as a wet sponge. For example, an artist has painted a picture of tortured naturalism. I immediately drink the health of the painter of this ugly picture because I am a lover of the best and highest. An author has written an ‘As You Like It’; at once I drink the health of those who do ‘like it’ because I love all that is best and highest. I demand general respect in return, and woe betide anybody who does not give me it. I live peacefully and die triumphantly – charming, you know, absolutely charming! And I should grow such a massive corporation and such a multitude of chins, and acquire by my activities such an imperially crimson nose, that everybody seeing me would exclaim, ‘Now he’s somebody! That’s a man who positively has something!’ And say what you like, gentlemen, in our negative age such exclamations are pleasant to hear!","Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was something to say about me. “Sluggard”—why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best club by right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had visions of it. That “sublime and beautiful” weighs heavily on my mind at forty But that is at forty; then—oh, then it would have been different! I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything “sublime and beautiful.” I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is “sublime and beautiful.” I should then have turned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is “sublime and beautiful.” An author has written As you will: at once I drink to the health of “anyone you will” because I love all that is “sublime and beautiful.” I should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute anyone who would not show me respect. I should live at ease, I should die with dignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming! And what a good round belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established, what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that everyone would have said, looking at me: “Here is an asset! Here is something real and solid!” And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such remarks about oneself in this negative age."

"«Помилуйте, — закричат вам, — восставать нельзя: это дважды два четыре! Природа вас не спрашивается; ей дела нет до ваших желаний и до того, нравятся ль вам ее законы или не нравятся. Вы обязаны принимать ее так, как она есть, а следственно, и все ее результаты. Стена, значит, и есть стена… и т. д., и т. д.». Господи боже, да какое мне дело до законов природы и арифметики, когда мне почему-нибудь эти законы и дважды два четыре не нравятся? Разумеется, я не пробью такой стены лбом, если и в самом деле сил не будет пробить, но я и не примирюсь с ней потому только, что у меня каменная стена и у меня сил не хватило.","“Have mercy,” they will shout to you, “you can’t rebel: it’s twice two four! Nature does not ask you; she does not care about your desires and whether you like her laws or not. You are obliged to accept it as it is, and consequently, all its results. A wall, therefore, is a wall ... etc., etc. ” Lord God, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic, when for some reason I don’t like these laws and twice two four? Of course, I won’t break through such a wall with my forehead if I really don’t have the strength to break through it, but I won’t put up with it just because I have a stone wall and I didn’t have enough strength.","“For pity's sake,” they'll shout at you, “you can't rebel: it's two times two is four! Nature doesn't ask your permission; it doesn't care about your wishes, or whether you like its laws or not. You're obliged to accept it as it is, and consequently all its results as well. And so a wall is indeed a wall . . . etc. , etc.” My God, but what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are not to my liking? To be sure, I won't break through such a wall with my forehead if I really have not got strength enough to do it, but neither will I be reconciled with it simply because I have a stone wall here and have not got strength enough.","‘Excuse me,’ they cry, ‘you can’t fight it; twice two is four! Nature doesn’t ask you about it; she’s not concerned with your wishes or with whether you like her laws or not. You must take her as she is, and consequently all her results as well. I mean to say, a wall is a wall,’ etc. , etc. But good God! what have the laws of nature and arithmetic to do with me, when for some reason I don’t like those laws or twice two? Naturally I shan’t break through the wall with my head, if I’m really not strong enough, but I won’t be reconciled to it simply because it’s a stone wall and I haven’t enough strength to break it down.","“Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a case of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on.” Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have not the strength."
"Впрочем, я тут же и назвал, сколько получаю жалованья. Я ужасно краснел.","However, I immediately said how much I receive a salary. I blushed terribly.","However, I told him straight out what my salary was.

"Вот однажды, в четверг, не выдержав моего одиночества и зная, что в четверг у Антона Антоныча дверь заперта, я вспомнил о Симонове. Подымаясь к нему в четвертый этаж, я именно думал о том, что этот господин тяготится мною и что напрасно я это иду. Но так как кончалось всегда тем, что подобные соображения, как нарочно, еще более подбивали меня лезть в двусмысленное положение, то я и вошел. Был почти год, как я последний раз перед тем видел Симонова.","Then one day, on Thursday, unable to bear my loneliness and knowing that Anton Antonich's door was locked on Thursday, I thought of Simonov. As I went up to him on the fourth floor, I was thinking that this gentleman was weary of me and that I was going in vain. But since it always ended with such considerations, as if on purpose, inciting me even more to get into an ambiguous position, I went in. It was almost a year since I last saw Simonov before.","And so once, on a Thursday, unable to endure my solitude, and knowing that on Thursdays Anton Antonych's door was closed, I remembered about Simonov. On the way up to his fourth-floor apartment, I was precisely thinking that I was a burden to this gentleman and that I shouldn't be going to him. But since in the end such considerations, as if by design, always egged me on further into some ambiguous situation, I did go in. It was almost a year since I had last seen Simonov.","So it was that one Thursday, unable to endure my solitude, and knowing that Anton Antonovich’s door was not open on Thursdays, I remembered Simonov. As I climbed up to his rooms on the fourth floor, I was thinking that the gentleman found me tiresome and there was no use going to see him. But as considerations of this kind always ended by further encouraging me to get into ambiguous situations, I went in. It was almost a year since the last time I had seen Simonov.","And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as it was Thursday Anton Antonitch ’s door would be closed, I thought of Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely, to put myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year since I had last seen Simonov."
"Хорошо еще, что развлекал меня в это время Аполлон своими грубостями. Из терпенья последнего выводил! Это была язва моя, бич, посланный на меня провиденьем. Мы с ним пикировались постоянно, несколько лет сряду, и я его ненавидел. Бог мой, как я его ненавидел! Никого в жизни я еще, кажется, так не ненавидел, как его, особенно в иные минуты. Человек он был пожилой, важный, занимавшийся отчасти портняжеством. Но неизвестно почему, он презирал меня, даже сверх всякой меры, и смотрел на меня нестерпимо свысока. Впрочем, он на всех смотрел свысока. Взглянуть только на эту белобрысую, гладко причесанную голову, на этот кок, который он взбивал себе на лбу и подмасливал постным маслом, на этот солидный рот, всегда сложенный ижицей,{44} — и вы уже чувствовали перед собой существо, не сомневавшееся в себе никогда. Это был педант в высочайшей степени, и самый огромный педант из всех, каких я только встречал на земле; и при этом с самолюбием, приличным разве только Александру Македонскому. Он был влюблен в каждую пуговицу свою, в каждый свой ноготь — непременно влюблен, он тем смотрел! Относился он ко мне вполне деспотически, чрезвычайно мало говорил со мной, а если случалось ему на меня взглядывать, то смотрел твердым, величаво самоуверенным и постоянно насмешливым взглядом, приводившим меня иногда в бешенство. Исполнял он свою должность с таким видом, как будто делал мне высочайшую милость. Впрочем, он почти ровно ничего для меня не делал и даже вовсе не считал себя обязанным что-нибудь делать. Сомнения быть не могло, что он считал меня за самого последнего дурака на всем свете, и если «держал меня при себе», то единственно потому только, что от меня можно было получать каждый месяц жалованье. Он соглашался «ничего не делать» у меня за семь рублей в месяц. Мне за него много простится грехов. Доходило иногда до такой ненависти, что меня бросало чуть не в судороги от одной его походки. Но особенно гадко было мне его пришепетывание. У него был язык несколько длиннее, чем следует, или что-то вроде этого, оттого он постоянно шепелявил и сюсюкал и, кажется, этим ужасно гордился, воображая, что это придает ему чрезвычайно много достоинства. Говорил он тихо, размеренно, заложив руки за спину и опустив глаза в землю. Особенно бесил он меня, когда, бывало, начнет читать у себя за перегородкой Псалтырь. Много битв вынес я из-за этого чтенья. Но он ужасно любил читать по вечерам, тихим, ровным голосом, нараспев, точно как по мертвом. Любопытно, что он тем и кончил: он теперь нанимается читать Псалтырь по покойникам, а вместе с тем истребляет крыс и делает ваксу. Но тогда я не мог прогнать его, точно он был слит с существованием моим химически. К тому же он бы и сам не согласился от меня уйти ни за что. Мне нельзя было жить в шамбр-гарни:{45} моя квартира была мой особняк, моя скорлупа, мой футляр, в который я прятался от всего человечества, а Аполлон, черт знает почему, казался мне принадлежащим к этой квартире, и я целых семь лет не мог согнать его.","It's good that Apollo entertained me at that time with his rudeness. He took the last out of patience! It was my ulcer, a scourge sent against me by Providence. We fought constantly, for several years in a row, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I don't think I hated anyone in my life as much as he did, especially at certain moments. He was an elderly, important man, partly engaged in tailoring. But for some unknown reason, he despised me, even beyond all measure, and looked at me with unbearable condescension. However, he looked down on everyone. Just look at this fair-haired, smoothly combed head, at this cook, which he fluffed up on his forehead and oiled with vegetable oil, at this solid mouth, always folded in a hijink, {44} - and you already felt in front of you a creature that did not doubt itself never. He was a pedant in the highest degree, and the most enormous pedant I have ever met on earth; and at the same time with pride, decent except for Alexander the Great. He was in love with every button of his, with every nail—certainly in love, that was how he looked! He treated me quite despotically, spoke extremely little to me, and if he happened to look at me, he looked at me with a firm, majestically self-confident and constantly mocking look, which sometimes drove me into a rage. He performed his office with such an air as if he was doing me the highest favor. However, he did almost exactly nothing for me and did not even consider himself obliged to do anything. There could be no doubt that he considered me to be the worst fool in the whole world, and if he ""kept me to himself"" it was only because he could get a salary from me every month. He agreed to ""do nothing"" with me for seven rubles a month. I will be forgiven many sins for him. Sometimes it came to such hatred that I was almost thrown into convulsions from one of his gaits. But his whispering was especially disgusting to me. His tongue was somewhat longer than it should be, or something like that, which is why he constantly lisped and lisped and seemed to be terribly proud of this, imagining that this gave him an extremely great deal of dignity. He spoke quietly, measuredly, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He especially pissed me off when he used to start reading the Psalter behind his partition. I have endured many battles because of this reading. But he was terribly fond of reading in the evenings, in a low, even voice, in a sing-song voice, as if it were dead. It is curious that he ended up like this: he is now hired to read the Psalter for the dead, and at the same time exterminates rats and makes wax. But then I could not drive him away, as if he were chemically merged with my existence. Besides, he wouldn't agree to leave me for anything. I couldn't live in shambre garni: {45} my apartment was my mansion, my shell, my case in which I hid from all mankind, and Apollo, God knows why, seemed to me to belong to this apartment, and I'm seven years could not drive him away.","It was a good thing Apollon diverted me at that time with his rudeness. Drove me out of all patience! He was my thorn, a scourge visited upon me by Providence. He and I had been in constant altercation for several years on end, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I think I've never in my life hated anyone as I did him, especially at certain moments. He was an elderly, imposing man, who occupied himself part of the time with tailoring. I don't know why, but he despised me even beyond all measure and looked at me with an insufferable haughtiness. But then he looked at everyone with haughtiness. One glance at that pale-haired, slicked-down head, at the quiff he fluffed up on his forehead and oiled with vegetable oil, at that serious mouth forever pursed in a V – and you immediately sensed before you a being who never doubted himself. He was in the highest degree a pedant, and the most enormous pedant of any I've ever met on earth; and this was accompanied by a vanity perhaps befitting only Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with his every button, his every fingernail – absolutely in love, and he looked it! He treated me quite despotically, spoke extremely little with me, and if he chanced to let his eyes rest on me, he did so with a firm, majestically self-confident, and permanently mocking look, which sometimes drove me to fury. He fulfilled his duties with such an air as if he were bestowing the highest favor upon me. However, he did almost exactly nothing for me, and did not even consider himself obliged to do anything. There was no doubting that he considered me the most complete fool in the whole world, and if he “kept me around,” it was solely because he could get his wages from me every month. He agreed to “do nothing” in my service for seven roubles a month. Many sins will be forgiven me for him. It sometimes reached such hatred that I'd be all but thrown into convulsions by his gait alone. But I loathed his lisp especially. His tongue was a bit longer than it should have been, or something like that, which caused him to be forever lisping and sissing, and he was apparently terribly proud of it, imagining that it lent him a great deal of dignity. He spoke softly, measuredly, placing his hands behind his back and looking down. He especially infuriated me when he'd start reading the Psalter behind his partition. I endured many a battle on account of that reading. But he liked terribly much to read in the evenings, in a soft, even voice, chanting as over a dead body. Curiously, that's how he ended up: he now hires himself out to read the Psalter over the deceased, and along with that he exterminates rats and makes shoe polish. But at the time I was unable to throw him out, as though he had combined chemically with my existence. Besides, he would not have agreed to leave me for anything. It was impossible for me to live in chambres garnies:[42] my apartment was my mansion, my shell, my case, in which I hid from all mankind, and Apollon, it seemed to me – devil knows why – belonged to that apartment, and for a whole seven years I was unable to throw him out.","It was a good thing that Apollon’s boorishness distracted my attention during that time. He completely exhausted my patience! He was my executioner, my cross, the scourge inflicted on me by Providence. For several years he and I had been constantly skirmishing, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I think I have never in my life hated anybody as much, especially at certain times. He was a pompous elderly man who also did a little tailoring. For some reason he held me in boundless contempt and treated me with intolerable condescension. But then he was condescending with everybody. You had only to look at that smooth flaxen poll and the heavily oiled quiff poking up above his forehead, or at that prim mouth always pursed into a V-shape, to feel that you were in the presence of a man who had never doubted himself in his life. He was consummately pedantic, the greatest pedant I have ever met, and his self-esteem would have been hardly becoming in Alexander of Macedon. He was besotted with himself, he doted on every one of his buttons, every one of his finger-nails: that was his essence! He tyrannized over me completely, spoke to me extremely seldom, and if he cast me an occasional glance, it was with a royally self-assured and perpetually derisive look that sometimes drove me wild. He carried out his duties as though he was doing me the greatest of favours. He did practically nothing for me, however, and did not even consider himself obliged to do anything. There could be no doubt that he considered me the greatest fool on earth, and if he ‘kept me in his service’ it was solely because he could get his wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. I shall be forgiven much for his sake. My hatred grew to such proportions that his very way of walking sometimes made me shudder. But what I loathed most was his lisping speech. His tongue was a little too long for him, or something, and this gave him a perpetual lisp and hiss, of which he appeared to be very proud, imagining that it conferred extraordinary distinction on him. He spoke in quiet, measured tones, with his hands behind his back and his eyes on the ground. I found it particularly infuriating when he used to begin reading the psalter aloud in his room. I fought many battles over that reading. But he was terribly fond of reading the psalter in the evening in his quiet, monotonous voice, as though he was reading over a corpse. It is interesting that that is what he ended by doing; now he reads the psalter over the dead, as well as exterminating rats and making blacking. But at that time I found I could no more dismiss him than if his being had been chemically combined with mine. Besides, he wouldn’t have consented to leave on any account. I couldn’t live in a furnished room; my flat was my private possession, my shell, my sheath, in which I hid from all mankind, and Apollon, God knows why, seemed to belong to that flat, and for the whole seven years I found it impossible to turn him out.","It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at that time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him, especially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably. Though, indeed, he looked down upon everyone. Simply to glance at that flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers—absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that “he did not get rid of me” was simply that he could get wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions. What I loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or something of that sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my existence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away."

But now the insult will never die within her, and however revolting the filth in store for her, her humiliation will elevate and purify her… through hate and… h’m, perhaps… forgiveness also. But will all this make things easier for her?’","“And will it not be better?” I mused fantastically, afterwards at home, stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. “Will it not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever? Resentment —why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful consciousness! Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her—the feeling of insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h’m! ... perhaps, too, by forgiveness.... Will all that make things easier for her though? ...”"
"Испуганное и оскорбленное чувство сменилось на лице ее сначала горестным изумлением. Когда же я стал называть себя подлецом и мерзавцем и полились мои слезы (я проговорил всю эту тираду со слезами), все лицо ее передернулось какой-то судорогой. Она хотела было встать, остановить меня; когда же я кончил, она не на крики мои обратила внимание: «Зачем ты здесь! зачем не уходишь!» — а на то, что мне, должно быть, очень тяжело самому было все это выговорить. Да и забитая она была такая, бедная; она считала себя бесконечно ниже меня; где ж ей было озлиться, обидеться? Она вдруг вскочила со стула в каком-то неудержимом порыве и, вся стремясь ко мне, но все еще робея и не смея сойти с места, протянула ко мне руки… Тут сердце и во мне перевернулось. Тогда она вдруг бросилась ко мне, обхватила мою шею руками и заплакала. Я тоже не выдержал и зарыдал так, как никогда еще со мной не бывало…","The frightened and offended feeling on her face was replaced at first by bitter amazement.

Yes, and she was so downtrodden, poor; she considered herself infinitely inferior to me; where could she be angry, offended? She suddenly jumped up from her chair in some uncontrollable impulse and, all striving towards me, but still shy and not daring to leave her place, stretched out her hands to me ... Then my heart turned over in me too. Then she suddenly rushed to me, threw her arms around my neck and began to cry. I, too, could not stand it and sobbed in a way that had never happened to me before ...","The frightened and insulted feeling in her face first gave way to rueful amazement. And when I began calling myself a scoundrel and a blackguard, and my tears poured down (I had spoken the entire tirade in tears), her whole face twisted in a sort of convulsion.

"Тогда-то, — это всё вы говорите, — настанут новые экономические отношения, совсем уж готовые и тоже вычисленные с математическою точностью, так что в один миг исчезнут всевозможные вопросы, собственно потому, что на них получатся всевозможные ответы. Тогда выстроится хрустальный дворец.{17} Тогда… Ну, одним словом, тогда прилетит птица Каган.{18} Конечно, никак нельзя гарантировать (это уж я теперь говорю), что тогда не будет, например, ужасно скучно (потому что что ж и делать-то, когда все будет расчислено по табличке), зато все будет чрезвычайно благоразумно. Конечно, от скуки чего не выдумаешь! Ведь и золотые булавки от скуки втыкаются, но это бы все ничего. Скверно то (это опять-таки я говорю), что чего доброго, пожалуй, и золотым булавкам тогда обрадуются. Ведь глуп человек, глуп феноменально. То есть он хоть и вовсе не глуп, но уж зато неблагодарен так, что поискать другого, так не найти. Ведь я, например, нисколько не удивлюсь, если вдруг ни с того ни с сего среди всеобщего будущего благоразумия возникнет какой-нибудь джентльмен с неблагородной или, лучше сказать, с ретроградной и насмешливою физиономией, упрет руки в боки и скажет нам всем: а что, господа, не столкнуть ли нам все это благоразумие с одного разу, ногой, прахом, единственно с тою целью, чтоб все эти логарифмы отправились к черту и чтоб нам опять по своей глупой воле пожить! Это бы еще ничего, но обидно то, что ведь непременно последователей найдет: так человек устроен. И все это от самой пустейшей причины, об которой бы, кажется, и упоминать не стоит: именно оттого, что человек, всегда и везде, кто бы он ни был, любил действовать так, как хотел, а вовсе не так, как повелевали ему разум и выгода; хотеть же можно и против собственной выгоды, а иногда и положительно должно (это уж моя идея). Свое собственное, вольное и свободное хотенье, свой собственный, хотя бы самый дикий каприз, своя фантазия, раздраженная иногда хоть бы даже до сумасшествия, — вот это-то все и есть та самая, пропущенная, самая выгодная выгода, которая ни под какую классификацию не подходит и от которой все системы и теории постоянно разлетаются к черту. И с чего это взяли все эти мудрецы, что человеку надо какого-то нормального, какого-то добродетельного хотения? С чего это непременно вообразили они, что человеку надо непременно благоразумно выгодного хотенья? Человеку надо — одного только самостоятельного хотенья, чего бы эта самостоятельность ни стоила и к чему бы ни привела. Ну и хотенье ведь черт знает…","Then—that’s all you say—new economic relations will set in, quite ready-made and also calculated with mathematical precision, so that in an instant all sorts of questions will disappear, in fact, because all sorts of answers will be obtained to them.

Well, in a word, then the Kagan bird will fly in.{18} and do something when everything is calculated according to the tablet), but everything will be extremely prudent. Of course, you can't think of anything out of boredom! After all, even gold pins stick out of boredom, but that would be all right.

That is, although he is not stupid at all, he is so ungrateful that it is impossible to find another to look for. After all, for example, I would not be at all surprised if, for no reason at all, in the midst of the general future prudence, some gentleman with an ignoble, or, rather, with a retrograde and mocking physiognomy, would appear, put his hands on his hips and tell us all: what , gentlemen, shouldn't we push all this prudence off at once, with a foot, with dust, for the sole purpose that all these logarithms go to hell and that we again live according to our stupid will! That would be nothing, but it’s a shame that after all, he will certainly find followers: that’s how a person works. And all this from the most empty reason, which, it seems, is not worth mentioning: precisely because a person, always and everywhere, whoever he was, loved to act as he wanted, and not at all as he was commanded. reason and benefit; one can want even against one's own benefit, and sometimes one should positively (this is my idea). His own, free and free desire, his own, even the wildest whim, his own fantasy, sometimes irritated even to the point of madness - that's all there is that missed, most profitable benefit, which cannot be classified under any classification. does not fit and from which all systems and theories constantly fly to hell. And where did all these wise men get it from, that a person needs some kind of normal, some kind of virtuous desire? Why did they invariably imagine that a person must necessarily have a prudently beneficial desire? A person needs only independent desire, no matter what this independence costs and no matter what it leads to. Well, the desire, after all, the devil knows ...","And it is then – this is still you speaking – that new economic relations will come, quite ready-made, and also calculated with mathematical precision, so that all possible questions will vanish in an instant, essentially because they will have been given all possible answers. Then the crystal palace will get built.[16] Then . . . well, in short, then the bird Kagan will come flying.[17] Of course, there's no guaranteeing (this is me speaking now) that it won't, for example, be terribly boring then (because what is there to do if everything's calculated according to some little table?), but, on the other hand, it will all be extremely reasonable. Of course, what inventions can boredom not lead to! Golden pins also get stuck in from boredom, but all that would be nothing. The bad thing is (this is me speaking again) that, for all I know, they may be glad of the golden pins then. Man really is stupid, phenomenally stupid. That is, he's by no means stupid, but rather he's so ungrateful that it would be hard to find the likes of him. I, for example, would not be the least bit surprised if suddenly, out of the blue, amid the universal future reasonableness, some gentleman of ignoble, or, better, of retrograde and jeering physiognomy, should emerge, set his arms akimbo, and say to us all: “Well, gentlemen, why don't we reduce all this reasonableness to dust with one good kick, for the sole purpose of sending all these logarithms to the devil and living once more according to our own stupid will!” That would still be nothing, but what is offensive is that he'd be sure to find followers : that's how man is arranged. And all this for the emptiest of reasons, which would seem not even worth mentioning: namely, that man, whoever he might be, has always and everywhere liked to act as he wants, and not at all as reason and profit dictate; and one can want even against one's own profit, and one sometimes even positively must (this is my idea now). One's own free and voluntary wanting, one's own caprice, however wild, one's own fancy, though chafed sometimes to the point of madness – all this is that same most profitable profit, the omitted one, which does not fit into any classification, and because of which all systems and theories are constantly blown to the devil. And where did all these sages get the idea that man needs some normal, some virtuous wanting? What made them necessarily imagine that what man needs is necessarily a reasonably profitable wanting? Man needs only independent wanting, whatever this independence may cost and wherever it may lead. Well, and this wanting, the devil knows .","‘Then,’ (this is all of you speaking), ‘a new political economy will come into existence, all complete, and also calculated with mathematical accuracy, so that all problems will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because all possible answers to them will have been supplied. Then the Palace of Crystal will arise. Then….’ Well, in short, the golden age will come again. Of course it is quite impossible (here I am speaking myself) to guarantee that it won’t be terribly boring then (because what can one do if everything has been plotted out and tabulated?), but on the other hand everything will be eminently sensible. Of course, boredom leads to every possible kind of ingenuity. After all, it is out of boredom that golden pins get stuck into people, but all this would not matter. What is bad (again this is me speaking) is that for all I know people may then find pleasure even in golden pins. Man, after all, is stupid, phenomenally stupid. That is to say, although he is not in the least stupid, he is so ungrateful that it is useless to expect anything else from him. Really I shall not be in the least surprised if, for example, in the midst of the future universal good sense, some gentleman with an ignoble, or rather a derisive and reactionary air, springs up suddenly out of nowhere, puts his arms akimbo and says to all of us, ‘Come on, gentlemen, why shouldn’t we get rid of all this calm reasonableness with one kick, just so as to send all these logarithms to the devil and be able to live our own lives at our own sweet will?’ That wouldn’t matter either, but what is really mortifying is that he would certainly find followers: that’s the way men are made. And all this for the most frivolous of reasons, hardly worth mentioning, one would think: namely that a man, whoever he is, always and everywhere likes to act as he chooses, and not at all according to the dictates of reason and self-interest; it is indeed possible, and sometimes positively imperative (in my view), to act directly contrary to one’s own best interests. One’s own free and unfettered volition, one’s own caprice, however wild, one’s own fancy, inflamed sometimes to the point of madness – that is the one best and greatest good, which is never taken into consideration because it will not fit into any classification, and the omission of which always sends all systems and theories to the devil. Where did all the sages get the idea that a man’s desires must be normal and virtuous? Why did they imagine that he must inevitably will what is reasonable and profitable? What a man needs is simply and solely independent volition, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. Well, but the devil only knows what volition…","Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the “Palace of Crystal” will be built. Then ... In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, à propos of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: “I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will!” That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he would be sure to find followers—such is the nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one’s own interests, and sometimes one positively ought (that is my idea). One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s own caprice, however wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy— is that very “most advantageous advantage” which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply independent choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice."

Видно было, что его любили. «За что? за что?» — думал я про себя. Изредка они приходили в пьяный восторг и целовались.

Zverkov lay down on the couch, putting one foot on the round table. The wine was also brought there. He actually offered them three bottles of his own. Of course, I was not invited. Everyone sat him down on the couch. They listened to him almost with reverence. It was obvious that he was loved. ""For what? for what?"" I thought to myself. Occasionally they would get drunk and kiss. They talked about the Caucasus, about what true passion is, about galbik, {41} about profitable places in the service; about how much income the hussar Podkharzhevsky had, whom none of them personally knew, and they were glad that he had a lot of income; about the extraordinary beauty and grace of Princess D-th, whom none of them had ever seen either; finally it came to the point that Shakespeare is immortal.","to sing . . . hm.” But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them; I assumed the most independent attitudes and waited impatiently for them to start talking to me first. But, alas, they didn't. And, oh, how I wished, how I wished at that moment to make peace with them! It struck eight o'clock, and finally nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov sprawled on the couch, placing one foot on a little round table. The wine was also transferred there. Indeed, he did stand them to three bottles of his own. He did not offer me any, of course. Everyone sat clustered around him on the sofa. They listened to him with all but reverence. One could see he was loved. ”But why? Why?” I kept thinking to myself. From time to time they would get into drunken raptures and kiss each other. They talked about the Caucasus, about what true passion is, about gambling, about profitable posts in the service; about how big was the income of the hussar Podkharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced that it was very big; about the remarkable beauty and grace of Princess D—, whom none of them had ever even seen; finally it came to Shakespeare being immortal.","H’m.’ But I didn’t sing. I merely tried not to look at any of them; I put on the most independent air I could manage and waited impartially for them to speak to me first. But unfortunately, they didn’t do so. And how much I would have given at that moment to make my peace with them! It struck eight o’clock and finally nine. They left the table for more comfortable seats. Zverkov sprawled on a sofa, resting one leg on a little round table. The wine was carried over there as well. Zverkov had indeed contributed three bottles of his own. I was naturally not invited to share them. They were all clustered round him on the sofa, listening to him almost deferentially. It was plain that they were attached to him. ‘Why, why?’ I wondered to myself. From time to time, in drunken transports, they even embraced him. They talked about the Caucasus, about the nature of true passion, about baccarat, about the most advantageous postings; about how much income the hussar Podkharchevsky (whom none of them knew personally) had, and how glad they were that it was so enormous; about the extraordinary beauty and grace of Princess D. (whom none of them had ever set eyes on); and finally they came to the conclusion that Shakespeare is immortal.","But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I assumed most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak first. But alas, they did not address me! And oh, how I wished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck eight, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own account. I, of course, was not invited to join them. They all sat round him on the sofa. They listened to him, almost with reverence. It was evident that they were fond of him. “What for? What for?” I wondered. From time to time they were moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to Shakespeare’s being immortal."
"— Э, полно, Лиза, какая уж тут книга, когда мне самому гадко вчуже. Да и не вчуже. У меня все это теперь в душе проснулось… Неужели, неужели тебе самой не гадко здесь? Нет, видно, много значит привычка! Черт знает, что привычка может из человека сделать. Да неужели ж ты серьезно думаешь, что никогда не состареешься, вечно хороша будешь и что тебя здесь веки вечные держать будут? Я не говорю уж про то, что и здесь пакость… А впрочем, я вот что тебе про это скажу, про теперешнее-то твое житье: вот ты теперь хоть и молодая, пригожая, хорошая, с душой, с чувством; ну, а знаешь ли ты, что вот я, как только давеча очнулся, мне тотчас и гадко стало быть здесь с тобой! Только в пьяном виде ведь и можно сюда попасть. А будь ты в другом месте, живи, как добрые люди живут, так я, может быть, не то что волочился б за тобой, а просто влюбился б в тебя, рад бы взгляду был твоему, не то что слову; у ворот бы тебя подстерегал, на коленках бы перед тобой выстаивал; как на невесту б свою на тебя смотрел, да еще за честь почитал. Подумать про тебя что-нибудь нечистое не осмелился бы. А здесь я ведь знаю, что я только свистни, и ты, хочешь не хочешь, иди за мной, и уж не я с твоей волей спрашиваюсь, а ты с моей. Последний мужик наймется в работники все-таки не всего себя закабалит, да и знает, что ему срок есть. А где твой срок? Подумай только: что ты здесь отдаешь? что кабалишь? Душу, душу, в которой ты невластна, кабалишь вместе с телом! Любовь свою на поругание всякому пьянице отдаешь! Любовь! — да ведь это все, да ведь это алмаз, девичье сокровище, любовь-то! Ведь чтоб заслужить эту любовь, иной готов душу положить, на смерть пойти. А во что твоя любовь теперь ценится? Ты вся куплена, вся целиком, и зачем уж тут любви добиваться, когда и без любви все возможно. Да ведь обиды сильнее для девушки нет, понимаешь ли ты? Вот, слышал я, тешат вас, дур, — позволяют вам любовников здесь иметь. Да ведь это одно баловство, один обман, один смех над вами, а вы верите. Что он, в самом деле, что ли, любит тебя, любовник-то? Не верю. Как он будет любить, коли знает, что тебя от него сейчас кликнут. Пакостник он после этого! Уважает ли он тебя хоть на каплю? Что у тебя с ним общего? Смеется он над тобой да тебя же обкрадывает — вот и вся его любовь! Хорошо еще, что не бьет. А может, и бьет. Спроси-ка его, коли есть такой у тебя: женится ли он на тебе? Да он тебе в глаза расхохочется, если только не наплюет иль не прибьет, — а ему самому, может, всей-то цены — два сломанных гроша. И за что, подумаешь, ты здесь жизнь свою погубила? Что тебя кофеем поят да кормят сытно? Да ведь для чего кормят-то? У другой бы, честной, в горло такой кусок не пошел, потому что знает, для чего кормят. Ты здесь должна, ну и все будешь должна и до конца концов должна будешь, до тех самых пор, что тобой гости брезгать начнут. А это скоро придет, не надейся на молодость. Тут ведь это все на почтовых летит. Тебя и вытолкают. Да и не просто вытолкают, а задолго сначала придираться начнут, попрекать начнут, ругать начнут, — как будто не ты ей здоровье свое отдала, молодость и душу даром для нее загубила, а как будто ты-то ее и разорила, по миру пустила, обокрала. И не жди поддержки: другие подруги-то твои тоже на тебя нападут, чтоб ей подслужиться, потому что здесь все в рабстве, совесть и жалость давно потеряли. Исподлились, и уж гаже, подлее, обиднее этих ругательств и на земле не бывает. И все-то ты здесь положишь, все, без завета, — и здоровье, и молодость, и красоту, и надежды, и в двадцать два года будешь смотреть как тридцатипятилетняя, и хорошо еще, коль не больная, моли бога за это. Ведь ты теперь небось думаешь, что тебе и работы нет, гульба! Да тяжелее и каторжнее работы на свете нет и никогда не бывало. Одно сердце, кажется, все бы слезами изошло. И ни слова не посмеешь сказать, ни полслова, когда тебя погонят отсюда, пойдешь как виноватая. Перейдешь ты в другое место, потом в третье, потом еще куда-нибудь и доберешься наконец до Сенной. А там уж походя бить начнут; это любезность тамошняя; там гость и приласкать, не прибив, не умеет. Ты не веришь, что там так противно? Ступай, посмотри когда-нибудь, может, своими глазами увидишь. Я вон раз видел там на Новый год одну, у дверей. Ее вытолкали в насмешку свои же проморозить маленько за то, что уж очень ревела, а дверь за ней притворили. В девять-то часов утра она уж была совсем пьяная, растрепанная, полунагая, вся избитая. Сама набелена, а глаза в черняках; из носа и из зубов кровь течет: извозчик какой-то только что починил. Села она на каменной лесенке, в руках у ней какая-то соленая рыба была; она ревела, что-то причитала про свою «учась», а рыбой колотила по лестничным ступеням. А у крыльца столпились извозчики да пьяные солдаты и дразнили ее. Ты не веришь, что и ты такая же будешь? И я бы не хотел верить, а почем ты знаешь, может быть, лет десять, восемь назад, эта же самая, с соленой-то рыбой, — приехала сюда откуда-нибудь свеженькая, как херувимчик, невинная, чистенькая; зла не знала, на каждом слове краснела. Может быть, такая же, как ты, была, гордая, обидчивая, на других не похожая, королевной смотрела и сама знала, что целое счастье того ожидает, кто бы ее полюбил и кого бы она полюбила. Видишь, чем кончилось? И что, если в ту самую минуту, когда она колотила этой рыбой о грязные ступени, пьяная да растрепанная, что, если в ту минуту ей припомнились все ее прежние, чистые годы в отцовском доме, когда еще она в школу ходила, а соседский сын ее на дороге подстерегал, уверял, что всю жизнь ее любить будет, что судьбу свою ей положит, и когда они вместе положили любить друг друга навеки и обвенчаться, только что вырастут большие! Нет, Лиза, счастье, счастье тебе, если где-нибудь там, в углу, в подвале, как давешняя, в чахотке поскорее помрешь. В больницу, говоришь ты? Хорошо — свезут, а если ты еще хозяйке нужна? Чахотка такая болезнь; это не горячка. Тут до последней минуты человек надеется и говорит, что здоров. Сам себя тешит. А хозяйке-то и выгодно. Не беспокойся, это так; душу, значит, продала, а к тому же деньги должна, значит и пикнуть не смеешь. А умирать будешь, все тебя бросят, все отвернутся, — потому, что с тебя тогда взять? Еще тебя же попрекнут, что даром место занимаешь, не скоро помираешь. Пить не допросишься, с ругательством подадут: «Когда, дескать, ты, подлячка, издохнешь; спать мешаешь стонешь, гости брезгают». Это верно; я сам подслушал такие слова. Сунут тебя, издыхающую, в самый смрадный угол в подвале, — темень, сырость; что ты, лежа-то одна, тогда передумаешь? Помрешь, — соберут наскоро, чужой рукой, с ворчаньем, с нетерпением, — никто-то не благословит тебя, никто-то не вздохнет по тебе, только бы поскорей тебя с плеч долой. Купят колоду, вынесут, как сегодня ту, бедную, выносили, в кабак поминать пойдут. В могиле слякоть, мразь, снег мокрый, — не для тебя же церемониться? «Спущай-ка ее, Ванюха; ишь ведь „учась“ и тут верх ногами пошла, таковская. Укороти веревки-то, пострел». — «Ладно и так». — «Чего ладно? Ишь на боку лежит. Человек тоже был али нет? Ну да ладно, засыпай». И ругаться-то из-за тебя долго не захотят. Засыплют поскорей мокрой синей глиной и уйдут в кабак… Тут и конец твоей памяти на земле; к другим дети на могилу ходят, отцы, мужья, а у тебя — ни слезы, ни вздоха, ни поминания, и никто-то, никто-то, никогда в целом мире не придет к тебе; имя твое исчезнет с лица земли — так, как бы совсем тебя никогда не бывало и не рождалось! Грязь да болото, хоть стучи себе там по ночам, когда мертвецы встают, в гробовую крышу: «Пустите, добрые люди, на свет пожить! Я жила — жизни не видала, моя жизнь на обтирку пошла; ее в кабаке на Сенной пропили; пустите, добрые люди, еще раз на свете пожить!..»","“Oh, that’s enough, Lisa, what kind of book is there when it’s disgustingly alien to me. Yes, and not outside. All this has now woken up in my soul ... Is it really, is it really not disgusting for you yourself here? No, apparently, habit means a lot! The devil knows what habit can make of a person. Do you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be good, and that they will keep you here forever? I’m not talking about the fact that here too it’s a dirty trick ... But, by the way, I’ll tell you what about this, about your present life: here you are now, though young, handsome, good, with a soul, with feeling; Well, do you know that as soon as I woke up just now, I immediately felt disgusted to be here with you! You can only get here if you're drunk. And if you were in another place, live like good people live, so I, perhaps, would not just drag you, but simply fall in love with you, I would be glad to have your look, not like a word; at the gate I would lie in wait for you, I would stand on my knees before you; as if he were his bride, he looked at you, and even considered you an honor. I would not dare to think anything unclean about you. But here I know that I only whistle, and you, whether you like it or not, follow me, and it’s not I who asks your will, but you ask mine. The last muzhik hires himself as a worker, yet he will not enslave himself entirely, and he knows that he has a time limit. Where is your deadline? Just think: what are you giving here? what are you messing with? Soul, soul, in which you have no power, bondage together with the body! You give your love as a reproach to every drunkard! Love! - but that's all, but it's a diamond, a girl's treasure, love! Indeed, in order to deserve this love, another is ready to lay down his soul, to go to death. And what is your love now valued? You are all bought, all of you, and why should you seek love, when everything is possible without love. Why, there is no stronger resentment for a girl, do you understand? Here, I heard, they amuse you, fools, they allow you to have lovers here. Why, this is one prank, one deceit, one laugh at you, and you believe. That he, in fact, or something, loves you, a lover? I do not believe. How will he love if he knows that they will call you from him now. He's a dick after that! Does he have any respect for you? What do you have in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you - that's all his love! It's good that it doesn't hit. Or maybe he hits. Ask him if you have one: will he marry you? Yes, he will burst out laughing in your eyes, unless he gives a damn or beats him up, - and to him, perhaps, the whole price is two broken pennies. And why do you think you ruined your life here? That they give you coffee and feed you well? But what are they fed for? For another, honestly, such a piece would not go down the throat, because she knows what they are fed for. You owe it here, well, you will owe everything, and you will owe it to the end, until the very moment that the guests begin to disdain you. And it will come soon, do not rely on youth. Here, after all, it's all on the post flies. They will push you out. And they won’t just push them out, but long before they start to find fault, they will start to reproach, they will start scolding - as if you didn’t give her your health, you ruined your youth and soul for nothing, but as if you ruined her, let her go around the world, robbed. And do not wait for support: your other friends will also attack you in order to serve it, because here everyone is in slavery, conscience and pity have long been lost. They've fallen down, and there is no more vile, meaner, more insulting than these curses on earth. And you will put everything here, everything, without a covenant - both health, and youth, and beauty, and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a thirty-five-year-old, and it’s good if you’re not sick, pray to God for this. After all, now you probably think that you don’t even have a job, you bastard! Yes, there is no harder and more hard labor in the world and never has been. One heart, it seems, would all come out in tears. And you won't dare to say a word, not half a word, when they drive you out of here, you will go like a guilty one. You will go to another place, then to a third, then somewhere else, and finally you will reach the Haymarket. And there they will start beating in passing; this courtesy there; there the guest does not know how to caress, without nailing. You don't believe it's so disgusting? Go and see sometime, maybe you'll see with your own eyes. I saw one there on New Year's Eve, at the door. She was pushed out in mockery by her own people to freeze a little for the fact that she was crying very much, and the door was shut behind her. At nine o'clock in the morning she was already completely drunk, disheveled, half-naked, all beaten up. She herself is whitewashed, and her eyes are in black; blood flows from the nose and from the teeth: some cab driver has just repaired it. She sat down on a stone ladder, in her hands she had some kind of salted fish; she roared, lamented something about her ""learning"", and beat the stairs with a fish. And at the porch cabbies and drunken soldiers crowded and teased her. Do you believe that you will be the same? And I would not want to believe, but how do you know, maybe ten, eight years ago, this same one, with some salted fish, came here from somewhere fresh, like a cherub, innocent, clean; I didn’t know evil, I blushed at every word. Maybe she was just like you, proud, touchy, not like others, she looked like a queen and she herself knew that a whole lot of happiness awaits who would love her and whom she would love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at the very moment when she was banging this fish on the dirty steps, drunk and disheveled, what if at that moment she remembered all her former, clean years in her father's house, when she still went to school, and the neighbor's son he lay in wait for her on the road, assured her that he would love her all his life, that he would lay down his fate for her, and when they decided together to love each other forever and get married, they would just grow up big! No, Liza, happiness, happiness to you, if somewhere there, in the corner, in the basement, like the old one, in consumption you will die as soon as possible. Hospital, you say? Well, they will take you, but what if the hostess still needs you? Consumption is such a disease; it's not a fever. Here, until the last minute, a person hopes and says that he is healthy. Amuses himself. And it's good for the hostess. Don't worry, it's true; So you sold your soul, and besides, you owe money, so you don’t dare to utter a word. And you will die, everyone will leave you, everyone will turn away - because then what to take from you? They will also reproach you for taking up space for nothing, you do not die soon. You won’t be interrogated to drink, they will serve you with a curse: “When, they say, you, little bastard, will die; you interfere with sleep, you moan, the guests disdain. It's right; I myself overheard such words. They will thrust you, dying, into the stinkiest corner in the basement - darkness, dampness; that you, lying alone, then change your mind? If you die, they will gather it hastily, by someone else's hand, with grumbling, impatiently, - no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, if only to hurry you off your shoulders. They will buy a deck, they will take it out, as they carried out that poor one today, they will go to the tavern to commemorate. There is slush, scum, wet snow in the grave - is it not for you to stand on ceremony? “Let her go, Vanyukha; you see, “learning” and then it went upside down, such. Shorten the ropes, you shot."" - ""Okay, so."" - ""What's okay? Look, it lies on its side. Was there a human too or not? Okay, go to sleep."" And they won’t want to swear because of you for a long time. They will quickly cover it with wet blue clay and go to a tavern ... This is the end of your memory on earth; children go to the grave of others, fathers, husbands, but you have no tears, no sigh, no remembrance, and no one, no one, will ever come to you in the whole world; your name will disappear from the face of the earth - as if you never existed and were not born at all! Dirt and swamp, at least knock yourself there at night, when the dead rise, on the coffin roof: “Let me, good people, live in the world! I lived - I didn’t see life, my life went to the wipe; they drank it in a tavern on the Sennaya; let me, good people, live in the world again! .. ""","Eh, come now, Liza, what have books got to do with it, if I myself feel vile for your sake. And not only for your sake. It all just rose up in my soul . . . Can it be, can it be that you don't find it vile here? No, habit evidently counts for a lot! Devil knows what habit can't make of a person. But can it be that you seriously think you'll never get old, that you'll be forever good-looking, and they'll keep you here forever and ever? It's foul enough even here, needless to say . . . However, this is what I can tell you about that, I mean, about your present life: granted you're young, attractive, nice, with a soul, with feelings; well, but do you know that when I came to my senses just now, I immediately felt vile for being here with you! One has to be drunk to end up here. But if you were in a different place, living as good people live, I might not just dangle after you, but simply fall in love with you, and be glad if you merely glanced at me, let alone spoke. I'd watch for you by the gate, I'd stay forever on my knees before you; I'd look upon you as my fiancee, and regard it as an honor. I wouldn't dare even think anything impure about you. While here I know I just have to whistle and, like it or not, you'll go with me, and it's no longer I who ask your will, but you mine. The merest peasant hires himself out to work – yet his bondage isn't total; besides, he knows there's a term to it. But where is your term? Just think: what is it you're giving up here? What are you putting in bondage? It's your soul, your soul, over which you have no power, that you put in bondage along with your body! You give your love to be profaned by any drunkard! Love! – but this is everything, it's a diamond, a maiden's treasure, this love! To deserve this love a man would be ready to lay down his soul, to face death. And what is the value of your love now? You're all bought, bought outright, and why try to obtain love if everything is possible without love? There's no worse offense for a girl, do you understand that? Now, I've heard that they humor you, fools that you are – they allow you to have lovers here. That's only an indulgence, only a deception, only a mockery of you, yet you believe it. What, does he really love you, this lover? I don't believe it. How can he love you, when he knows that you'll be called away from him any moment. He's a rotter in that case! Does he have even a drop of respect for you? What do you have in common with him? He's laughing at you while he steals from you – that's what his love amounts to! You can be thankful if he doesn't beat you. But maybe he does. Ask yours, if you have one: will he marry you? He'll burst out laughing in your face, if he doesn't spit, or give you a beating – and meanwhile his total worth is maybe two broken kopecks. And for the sake of what, one wonders, have you ruined your life here? For having coffee to drink, and being well fed? But what do they feed you for? Another woman, an honest one, would choke on it, because she'd know what they're feeding her for. You're in debt here, so you'll stay in debt, and you'll be in debt till the final end, till the time when the clients start spurning you. And that will come soon, don't count on your youth. It all flies by posthaste here. So they'll kick you out. And not simply kick you out, but first start picking on you long beforehand, reproaching you, abusing you – as if it wasn't you who gave her your health, destroyed your youth and soul for her in vain, but as if it was you who ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don't look for any support: the other girls will also attack you, to get in good with her, because everyone here is a slave and has long since lost all conscience and compassion. They're sunk in meanness, and no abuse in the world is more foul, mean, or offensive than that. And you'll lay down everything here , everything without stint – health, and youth, and beauty, and hopes – and at twenty-two you'll look like you're thirty-five, and you'll be lucky if you're not sick, pray to God for that. You must be thinking now that it's a picnic and not work at all! But there is not and never has been any harder or harsher work in the world than this. One would think your heart alone would simply pour itself out in tears. And you won't dare say a word, not half a word, when they throw you out of here; you'll go as if you were the one to blame. You'll go to another place, then to a third, then somewhere else, and finally you'll reach the Haymarket. And there they'll give you the routine beating; it's a courtesy of the place; there a client can't even be nice to a girl without beating her first. You don't believe it's so disgusting there? Go and look someday, maybe you'll see with your own eyes. I once saw a girl there, alone, by the door, on New Year's day. Her own people had kicked her out for the fun of it, to cool her off a bit, because she was howling too much, and locked the door behind her. At nine o'clock in the morning she was already completely drunk, disheveled, half-naked, all beaten up. Her face was powdered white, and her eyes were black-and-blue; blood was flowing from her nose and teeth: some coachman had just given her a pasting. She sat down on the stone stairs, holding some kind of salted fish; she was howling and wailing something about her 'miserble lot,' beating her fish against the steps. And coachmen and drunken soldiers crowded around the steps, teasing her. You don't believe you'll be the same? I wouldn't want to believe it either, but how do you know, maybe this same girl, the one with the salted fish, came here from somewhere ten or, say, eight years ago, fresh as a little cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, and blushing at every word. Maybe she was just like you – proud, touchy, different from the rest; she had the look of a princess, and knew that complete happiness awaited the one who would love her, and whom she would love. See where it ended up? And what if at the same moment as she sat there, drunk and disheveled, beating her fish on the dirty steps, what if at that moment she recalled all her former pure years in her father's house, when she was still going to school, and the neighbor's son used to watch for her on the way, assured her he would love her all his life, that he would make his fate hers, and they made a vow together to love each other forever and to be married as soon as they got bigger! No, Liza, it will be lucky, lucky for you if you die quickly of consumption, someplace in a corner, in a basement, like that girl. In a hospital, you say? If they take you there, fine, but what if your madam still needs you? Consumption is that sort of illness; it's not a fever. A person goes on hoping till the last moment, saying he's well. It's just self-indulgence. But there's profit in it for the madam. Don't worry, it's true; you've sold your soul, you owe money besides, so you don't dare make a peep. And when you're dying, they'll all abandon you, they'll all turn away from you – because what good are you then? They'll even reproach you for uselessly taking up space and not dying quickly enough. You'll have a hard time getting a drink of water, they'll give it to you with a curse: 'Hurry up and croak, you slut ; you're moaning, people can't sleep, the clients are disgusted.' It's true; I've overheard such words myself. They'll shove you, on the point of croaking, into the stinkingest corner of the basement – dark, damp; what will you go over in your mind then, lying there alone? You'll die – they'll lay you out hurriedly, strangers' hands, grumblingly, impatiently – and no one will bless you, no one will sigh over you, all they'll think is how to get you off their backs quickly. They'll buy a pine box, take you out as they did that poor girl today, and go to a pot-house to commemorate you. There's slush, muck, wet snow in the grave — they won't go to any trouble over you. ' Lower her in, Vanyukha; look at this “miserable lot” going legs up even here – the so-and-so. Shorten the ropes, you rascal.' ' It'll do as it is.' ' What'll do? She's lying on her side. You got a human being here, don't you? Well, that'll do, fill it in.' They won't even want to argue long because of you. They'll cover you up quickly with wet blue clay and go to the pothouse . . . That's the end of your memory on earth; other people's graves are visited by children, fathers, husbands, but at yours – not a tear, not a sigh, not a prayer, and no one, no one in the whole world will ever come to you; your name will disappear from the face of the earth – as if you'd never existed, as if you'd never been born! Mud and swamp, go ahead and knock on your coffin lid at night, when dead men rise: 'Let me out, good people, to live in the world! I lived – but saw nothing of life , my life was used up like an old rag; it got drunk up in a pothouse on the Haymarket; let me out, good people, to live in the world one more time!","‘Oh, stop it, Liza; if I’m disgusted, it’s on your behalf and has nothing to do with books. And not only on your behalf. I’ve just wakened up to all this myself…. You must be revolted by all this, aren’t you? No, evidently habit counts for a lot! The devil only knows what habit can do to a man. But surely you can’t seriously think you’ll never get old and will always stay pretty, or that they’ll keep you here for ever? I don’t even mention the fact that it is pretty nasty even here…. However, I’ll say this about it – about this place you are living in: even though you are young and attractive and pretty now, with feelings and sensitivity; well, do you know, as soon as I woke just now, I was revolted to find myself here with you! You have to be drunk to come here. But if you were in a different kind of place, living as decent people live, then perhaps I would not only hang round you, but absolutely fall in love with you, and be glad of a look, let alone a word, from you; I’d lie in wait for you at your gate, I’d always be on my knees to you , I’d look on you as my future wife, and think myself honoured. I wouldn’t dare have any impure thoughts about you. But here I know I’ve only to whistle and you’ll come to me, like it or not, and you’ll be at my beck and call, not me at yours. The lowest little peasant can hire himself out to work, but all the same he won’t be altogether a slave, and besides he knows it won’t last for ever. But when will you be free? And think what it is you are giving up here! What are you selling into slavery? Your soul as well as your body, the soul you have no right to enslave! You let your love be profaned by any and every drunken sot! Your love! – And that is everything, you know, it is a diamond; love is every young girl’s treasure! To earn that love, some men are ready to give up their lives, their very souls. But what is your love worth now? You have been bought, the whole of you, and why should anybody try to win love when he can have everything without it? And for a girl there’s no worse crime than that , do you understand? – I’ve been told they try to keep you silly creatures happy – they allow you to have your own lovers. But that’s just pampering you, they’re fooling you, laughing at you, and you believe them! Does he really love you, that lover? I don’t believe it. How can he, if he knows you might be called away at any moment to somebody else? That makes him no better than filthy scum! Will he have the slightest respect for you? What have you in common with him? He’ll laugh at you and steal from you – that’s the extent of his love! You’ll be lucky if he doesn’t beat you! But perhaps he will. Ask him, if you have somebody like that, whether he’ll marry you. He’ll laugh in your face, if he doesn’t spit on you or knock you down – and yet perhaps he’s not worth a brass farthing himself. And what do you think you’ve ruined your life for? To be given coffee to drink and plenty to eat? And what do they feed you for? A decent woman wouldn’t let that food touch her lips, because she knows what its purpose is. – You’re in debt here and you’ll go on being in debt, you’ll be in debt to the very end, till the time when the customers begin to be disgusted with you. And that time will soon come; don’t rely on your youth. In this, place all that sort of thing is gone like the wind. You’ll be turned out… and not simply turned out; long before that you’ll begin to be bullied and blamed and sworn at – just as if you hadn’t thrown away your health and youth and soul for her profit, but instead had ruined her, robbed her and reduced her to beggary. And don’t expect any support: the others, your pals, will attack you as well, to keep on the right side of her, because everybody here is a slave, and long ago lost all conscience and pity. They are steeped in filth, and there is nothing on earth as nasty, dirty, and offensive as their abuse. And you will have given up everything, everything, whole-heartedly – health, youth, beauty, hope – and at twenty-two you’ll look like thirty-five, and you’ll be lucky if you are not a sick woman – pray God you won’t be! I suppose you think now that you don’t have to work , it’s all one long holiday! But there is no harder and more back-breaking toil on earth, and never has been. I should think anybody would eat her heart out. – And you won’t dare utter a word, not a syllable, when you are turned out of here; you’ll go as if it was all your fault. You’ll transfer yourself to another place, and then to a third, and somewhere else after that, and in the end you’ll come to the Hay-market. And there you’ll be beaten up as a matter of course; that’s one of their charming habits; they don’t know how to show a guest he’s welcome except by beating him up. Don’t you believe it’s so horrible there? Go and have a look some time, and perhaps you’ll see for yourself. Once I saw a woman, on New Year’s day, outside a door. Her own people had thrown her out, with ill-natured laughter, to cool off a bit, because she was making too much noise, and locked the door behind her. At nine o’clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, tousled, half-naked, and covered with bruises. Her face was as white as chalk, but it was black round the eyes; blood was flowing from her nose; some cabby had just been using his fists on her. She sat down on the stone step, holding a dry salt fish in her hand; she was howling and bewailing her “fate”, and battering the fish against the steps. The cabbies and drunken soldiers crowding round the doorway mocked at her. You don’t believe that you’ll ever be like that, do you? And I should like not to believe it, but how do you know? perhaps two years ago, or eight, that same woman with the salt fish arrived here from somewhere, fresh and innocent and pure, like a little cherub, ignorant of evil and blushing at every word. Perhaps she was just the same kind as you: proud, sensitive, not like the others, she looked like a queen, and she knew that perfect happiness was waiting for the man who would love her and whom she would love. You see how it ended, don’t you? And what if at that moment when, drunken and dishevelled, she beat that fish against the dirty steps, what if at that moment all her clean early life in her father’s house came back to her, the years when she was still going to school, and the neighbour’s son waited for her on the way there, and told her he would love her all his life, and put his destiny in her hands, and they promised to love one another for ever, and get married as soon as they grew big? No, Liza, it will be good luck, good luck for you, if you die soon of consumption somewhere in a corner, in a cellar, like that girl I told you about just now. In hospital, do you say? Good – they’ll take you there – but if the madam still needs you? Consumption is a special kind of illness; it’s not a fever. With it, a person can hope till the last minute, and say she’s well. She can reassure herself. And it’s to the madam’s benefit. Don’t worry, it’s true; it means you’ve sold your soul, and besides you owe money, and so you daren’t say a word. And when you die, they’ll all abandon you, all turn away from you – because what good will you be to them then? What’s more, you’ll be reproached for uselessly taking up room and not dying quickly enough. You’ll beg in vain for a drink of water, and be given it with a curse; “When will you kick the bucket, you slut?” they’ll say; “you won’t let us sleep, you keep on groaning, you make the customers sick.” This is quite true; I have overheard things like it myself. When you’re really dying, you’ll be pushed into a stinking corner of the cellar, in the darkness and the damp; what will you think about then, lying there alone? When you die, you’ll be carted off in a hurry, by strangers, grumbling and impatient – nobody will say a prayer for you, nobody will sigh over you – they’ll simply want to get you out of sight as quickly as they can. They’ll buy a box and carry you out as they did that poor girl today, and hold your wake in the pub. There’ll be wet snow, and slush and slime in the grave, and they’re not likely to stand on ceremony with the likes of you. “Let her down, Vanya; well, there’s a fine thing! – even here she has to have her legs in the air – that’s the sort she is. Shorten those ropes, don’t fool about.” “It’s all right as it is.” “What do you mean all right? It’s lying on its side, isn’t it? After all, she’s a human being. Oh well, all right, fill it in.” They won’t waste much time even arguing about you. They’ll shovel in the dark-blue clay and go off to the pub…. That’ll be the end of your memory on the earth; other women have children to come to their graveside, and fathers and husbands – but there’ll be no tears or sighs or prayers for you, and nobody, nobody at all in the whole world will ever come to your grave: your name will vanish from the face of the earth – just as if you had never existed, never been born! All in the mud and marsh, you can knock as much as you like on the coffin lid at night, when the dead awaken: “Let me out, good people, to live in the world. When I was alive I saw nothing of life; my life ran away down the drain; I drank it away in a pub in the Haymarket; let me live on earth again, good people!”’","“Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don’t look at it as an outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it possible, is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with anyone. Can you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be good-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though let me tell you this about it—about your present life, I mean; here though you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or not. I don’t consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer hires himself as a workman, but he doesn’t make a slave of himself altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of! You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that’s everything, you know, it’s a priceless diamond , it’s a maiden’s treasure, love—why, a man would be ready to give his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for love when you can have everything without love. And you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers of your own here. But you know that’s simply a farce, that’s simply a sham, it’s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don’t believe it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you —that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your face, if he doesn’t spit in it or give you a blow—though maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you up? An honest girl couldn’t swallow the food, for she would know what she was being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don’t rely upon your youth—all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she’ll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don’t expect anyone to take your part: the others, your companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won’t dare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don’t know how to be friendly without beating you. You don’t believe that it is so hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New Year’s Day, I saw a woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine o’clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her. You don’t believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled—what if at that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father’s house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour’s son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself And that just suits your madam. Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have sold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a word. But when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then there will be nothing to get from you. What’s more, they will reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you beg you won’t get a drink of water without abuse: ‘Whenever are you going off, you nasty hussy, you won’t let us sleep with your moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.’ That’s true, I have heard such things said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in the cellar—in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet snow—no need to put themselves out for you—‘Let her down, Vanuha; it’s just like her luck—even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten the cord, you rascal.’ ‘It’s all right as it is.’ ‘All right, is it? Why, she’s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never mind, throw the earth on her.’ And they won’t care to waste much time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from the face of the earth—as though you had never existed, never been born at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night , when the dead arise, however you cry: ‘Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world again.’”"

"— Да-с, но вот тут-то для меня и запятая! Господа, вы меня извините, что я зафилософствовался; тут сорок лет подполья! позвольте пофантазировать. Видите ли-с: рассудок, господа, есть вещь хорошая, это бесспорно, но рассудок есть только рассудок и удовлетворяет только рассудочной способности человека, а хотенье есть проявление всей жизни, то есть всей человеческой жизни, и с рассудком, и со всеми почесываниями. И хоть жизнь наша в этом проявлении выходит зачастую дрянцо, но все-таки жизнь, а не одно только извлечение квадратного корня. Ведь я, например, совершенно естественно хочу жить для того, чтоб удовлетворить всей моей способности жить, а не для того, чтоб удовлетворить одной только моей рассудочной способности, то есть какой-нибудь одной двадцатой доли всей моей способности жить. Что знает рассудок? Рассудок знает только то, что успел узнать (иного, пожалуй, и никогда не узнает; это хоть и не утешение, но отчего же этого и не высказать?), а натура человеческая действует вся целиком, всем, что в ней есть, сознательно и бессознательно, и хоть врет, да живет. Я подозреваю, господа, что вы смотрите на меня с сожалением; вы повторяете мне, что не может просвещенный и развитой человек, одним словом, такой, каким будет будущий человек, зазнамо захотеть чего-нибудь для себя невыгодного, что это математика. Совершенно согласен, действительно математика. Но повторяю вам в сотый раз, есть один только случай, только один, когда человек может нарочно, сознательно пожелать себе даже вредного, глупого, даже глупейшего, а именно: чтоб иметь право пожелать себе даже и глупейшего и не быть связанным обязанностью желать себе одного только умного. Ведь это глупейшее, ведь это свой каприз, и в самом деле, господа, может быть всего выгоднее для нашего брата из всего, что есть на земле, особенно в иных случаях. А в частности, может быть выгоднее всех выгод даже и в таком случае, если приносит нам явный вред и противоречит самым здравым заключениям нашего рассудка о выгодах, потому что во всяком случае сохраняет нам самое главное и самое дорогое, то есть нашу личность и нашу индивидуальность. Иные вот утверждают, что это и в самом деле всего для человека дороже; хотенье, конечно, может, если хочет, и сходиться с рассудком, особенно если не злоупотреблять этим, а пользоваться умеренно; это и полезно и даже иногда похвально. Но хотенье очень часто и даже большею частию совершенно и упрямо разногласит с рассудком и… и… и знаете ли, что и это полезно и даже иногда очень похвально? Господа, положим, что человек не глуп. (Действительно, ведь никак нельзя этого сказать про него, хоть бы по тому одному, что если уж он будет глуп, так ведь кто же тогда будет умен?) Но если и не глуп, то все-таки чудовищно неблагодарен! Неблагодарен феноменально. Я даже думаю, что самое лучшее определение человека — это: существо на двух ногах и неблагодарное. Но это еще не все; это еще не главный недостаток его; главнейший недостаток его — это постоянное неблагонравие, постоянное, начиная от Всемирного потопа до Шлезвиг-Гольштейнского периода судеб человеческих. Неблагонравие, а следственно, и неблагоразумие; ибо давно известно, что неблагоразумие не иначе происходит, как от неблагонравия. Попробуйте же бросьте взгляд на историю человечества; ну, что вы увидите? Величественно? Пожалуй, хоть и величественно; уж один колосс Родосский, например, чего стоит! Недаром же г-н Анаевский свидетельствует о нем,{19} что одни говорят, будто он есть произведение рук человеческих; другие же утверждают, что он создан самою природою. Пестро? Пожалуй, хоть и пестро; разобрать только во все века и у всех народов одни парадные мундиры на военных и статских — уж одно это чего стоит, а с вицмундирами и совсем можно ногу сломать; ни один историк не устоит. Однообразно? Ну, пожалуй, и однообразно: дерутся да дерутся, и теперь дерутся, и прежде дрались, и после дрались, — согласитесь, что это даже уж слишком однообразно. Одним словом, все можно сказать о всемирной истории, все, что только самому расстроенному воображению в голову может прийти. Одного только нельзя сказать, — что благоразумно. На первом слове поперхнетесь. И даже вот какая тут штука поминутно встречается: постоянно ведь являются в жизни такие благонравные и благоразумные люди, такие мудрецы и любители рода человеческого, которые именно задают себе целью всю жизнь вести себя как можно благонравнее и благоразумнее, так сказать, светить собой ближним, собственно для того, чтоб доказать им, что действительно можно на свете прожить и благонравно, и благоразумно. И что ж? Известно, многие из этих любителей, рано ли, поздно ли, под конец жизни изменяли себе, произведя какой-нибудь анекдот, иногда даже из самых неприличнейших. Теперь вас спрошу: чего же можно ожидать от человека как от существа, одаренного такими странными качествами? Да осыпьте его всеми земными благами, утопите в счастье совсем с головой, так, чтобы только пузырьки вскакивали на поверхности счастья, как на воде; дайте ему такое экономическое довольство, чтоб ему совсем уж ничего больше не оставалось делать, кроме как спать, кушать пряники и хлопотать о непрекращении всемирной истории, — так он вам и тут, человек-то, и тут, из одной неблагодарности, из одного пасквиля мерзость сделает. Рискнет даже пряниками и нарочно пожелает самого пагубного вздора, самой неэкономической бессмыслицы, единственно для того, чтобы ко всему этому положительному благоразумию примешать свой пагубный фантастический элемент. Именно свои фантастические мечты, свою пошлейшую глупость пожелает удержать за собой единственно для того, чтоб самому себе подтвердить (точно это так уж очень необходимо), что люди все еще люди, а не фортепьянные клавиши, на которых хоть и играют сами законы природы собственноручно, но грозят до того доиграться, что уж мимо календаря и захотеть ничего нельзя будет. Да ведь мало того: даже в том случае, если он действительно бы оказался фортепьянной клавишей, если б это доказать ему даже естественными науками и математически, так и тут не образумится, а нарочно напротив что-нибудь сделает, единственно из одной неблагодарности; собственно чтоб настоять на своем. А в том случае, если средств у него не окажется, — выдумает разрушение и хаос, выдумает разные страдания и настоит-таки на своем! Проклятие пустит по свету, а так как проклинать может только один человек (это уж его привилегия, главнейшим образом отличающая его от других животных), так ведь он, пожалуй, одним проклятием достигнет своего, то есть действительно убедится, что он человек, а не фортепьянная клавиша! Если вы скажете, что и это все можно рассчитать по табличке, и хаос, и мрак, и проклятие, так уж одна возможность предварительного расчета все остановит и рассудок возьмет свое, — так человек нарочно сумасшедшим на этот случай сделается, чтоб не иметь рассудка и настоять на своем! Я верю в это, я отвечаю за это, потому что ведь все дело-то человеческое, кажется, и действительно в том только и состоит, чтоб человек поминутно доказывал себе, что он человек, а не штифтик! хоть своими боками, да доказывал; хоть троглодитством, да доказывал. А после этого как не согрешить, не похвалить, что этого еще нет и что хотенье покамест еще черт знает от чего зависит…","“Yes, sir, but that’s where the comma comes in for me!” Gentlemen, you will excuse me that I philosophized; here forty years of underground! let me fantasize. You see, sir, reason, gentlemen, is a good thing, that is indisputable, but reason is only reason and satisfies only the rational ability of a person, while desire is a manifestation of all life, that is, all human life, both with reason and with all scratching. And although our life in this manifestation often turns out to be rubbish, but still life, and not just the extraction of a square root. After all, for example, I quite naturally want to live in order to satisfy my entire ability to live, and not in order to satisfy only my rational ability, that is, some one-twentieth of my entire ability to live. What does the mind know? Reason knows only what it has managed to know (it will probably never know anything else; although this is not a consolation, why shouldn’t it be said?), while human nature acts in its entirety, with everything that is in it, consciously and unconsciously, and even if he's lying, he lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you look at me with pity; you repeat to me that an enlightened and developed person, in a word, such as the future person will be, cannot deliberately want something unprofitable for himself, that this is mathematics. Absolutely agree, really mathematics. But I repeat to you for the hundredth time, there is only one case, only one, when a person can deliberately, consciously wish for himself even harmful, stupid, even the stupidest, namely: in order to have the right to wish himself even the stupidest and not be bound by the obligation to wish himself one thing. only smart. After all, this is the most stupid thing, because this is a whim of its own, and in fact, gentlemen, it can be the most beneficial for our brother from everything that exists on earth, especially in other cases. And in particular, it can be more profitable than all benefits even in such a case, if it brings us obvious harm and contradicts the most sound conclusions of our reason about benefits, because in any case it preserves for us the most important and dearest, that is, our personality and our individuality. . Others now argue that this is, in fact, the most precious thing for a person; desire, of course, can, if it wants, converge with reason, especially if this is not abused, but used moderately; it is both useful and sometimes even commendable. But desire very often and even for the most part is completely and stubbornly at odds with reason and ... and ... and do you know that this is also useful and even sometimes very commendable? Gentlemen, let us assume that a person is not stupid. (Indeed, there is no way to say this about him, even if only from the fact that if he is stupid, then who will be smart then?) But if he is not stupid, then he is still monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenal ungrateful. I even think that the best definition of a person is: a creature on two legs and ungrateful. But that is not all; this is not yet its main shortcoming; its main drawback is its constant bad temper, constant, from the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period of human destinies. Unkindness, and consequently, imprudence; for it has long been known that indiscretion does not proceed otherwise than from indiscretion. Try to cast a glance at the history of mankind; well, what will you see? Majestically? Perhaps, albeit majestically; one colossus of Rhodes, for example, what is it worth! It is not for nothing that Mr. Anaevsky testifies of him, {19} that some say that he is the work of human hands; others say that it was created by nature itself. Motley? Perhaps, though motley; to dismantle only in all ages and among all peoples the same ceremonial uniforms for military and civilians - this alone is worth something, but with uniforms you can completely break your leg; no historian can resist. Monotonous? Well, perhaps, it is monotonous: they fight and fight, and now they are fighting, and before they fought, and after they fought - you must admit that this is even too monotonous. In a word, everything can be said about world history, everything that only the most disturbed imagination can come up with. Only one thing cannot be said - what is prudent. You will choke on the first word. And even this thing is constantly encountered here: after all, such well-meaning and prudent people constantly appear in life, such wise men and lovers of the human race, who set themselves the goal of all their lives to behave as well-behaved and prudent as possible, so to speak, to shine themselves to their neighbors, in fact in order to prove to them that it is really possible to live in the world both morally and prudently. So what? It is known that many of these amateurs, sooner or later, at the end of their lives, betrayed themselves by producing some kind of anecdote, sometimes even the most obscene. Now I ask you: what can be expected from a person as from a being endowed with such strange qualities? Yes, shower him with all earthly blessings, drown him in happiness completely with his head, so that only bubbles jump up on the surface of happiness, as if on water; give him such economic satisfaction that he has absolutely nothing left to do but sleep, eat gingerbread and fuss about the non-stopping of world history - so he is here, man, and here, out of one ingratitude, out of one libel will do an abomination. He will risk even gingerbread and deliberately wish for the most pernicious nonsense, the most non-economic nonsense, solely in order to mix his pernicious fantastic element into all this positive prudence. It is precisely his fantastic dreams, his vulgar stupidity that he wishes to keep for himself solely in order to confirm to himself (as if it is so very necessary) that people are still people, and not piano keys, on which, although the very laws of nature are played with their own hands, but they threaten to play it out so much that it will be impossible to want anything past the calendar. But not only that: even if he really turned out to be a piano key, if this were proved to him even by the natural sciences and mathematically, he would not come to his senses here either, but would deliberately do something on the contrary, solely out of ingratitude; actually to insist on his own. And in the event that he does not have the means, he will invent destruction and chaos, invent various sufferings and still insist on his own! The curse will spread all over the world, and since only one person can curse (this is his privilege, which most importantly distinguishes him from other animals), so he, perhaps, with one curse will achieve his goal, that is, he will really be convinced that he is a man, and not piano key! If you say that all this can be calculated from a tablet, and chaos, and darkness, and damnation, then the mere possibility of a preliminary calculation will stop everything and reason will take its toll - so a person will become mad on purpose in this case so as not to have reason and stand your ground! I believe in this, I am responsible for it, because the whole thing seems to be human, and really only consists in this, that a person should constantly prove to himself that he is a man, and not a brad! even with his sides, yes he proved; even with troglodytes, yes he proved it. And after that, how not to sin, not to praise that this does not yet exist and that the desire for the time being still the devil knows what depends on ...","Yes, sirs, but for me that's just where the hitch comes! You will forgive me, gentlemen, for philosophizing away; it's a matter of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy a bit. You see: reason, gentlemen, is a fine thing, that is unquestionable, but reason is only reason and satisfies only man's reasoning capacity, while wanting is a manifestation of the whole of life – that is, the whole of human life, including reason and various little itches. And though our life in this manifestation often turns out to be a bit of trash, still it is life and not just the extraction of a square root. I, for example, quite naturally want to live so as to satisfy my whole capacity for living, and not so as to satisfy just my reasoning capacity alone, which is some twentieth part of my whole capacity for living. What does reason know? Reason knows only what it has managed to learn (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is no consolation, but why not say it anyway?), while human nature acts as an entire whole, with everything that is in it, consciously and unconsciously, and though it lies, still it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with pity; you repeat to me that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, simply cannot knowingly want anything unprofitable for himself, that this is mathematics. I agree completely, it is indeed mathematics. But I repeat to you for the hundredth time, there is only one case, one only, when man may purposely, consciously wish for himself even the harmful, the stupid, even what is stupidest of all: namely, so as to have the right to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all and not be bound by an obligation to wish for himself only what is intelligent. For this stupidest of all, this caprice of ours, gentlemen, may in fact be the most profitable of anything on earth for our sort, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more profitable than all other profits even in the case when it is obviously harmful and contradicts the most sensible conclusions of our reason concerning profits – because in any event it preserves for us the chiefest and dearest thing, that is, our personality and our individuality. Now, some insist that this is indeed the dearest of all things for man; wanting may, of course, converge with reason, if it wants, especially if this is not abused but is done with moderation; it is both useful and sometimes even praiseworthy. But wanting is very often, and even for the most part, completely and stubbornly at odds with reason, and . . . and . . . and, do you know, this, too, is useful and sometimes even quite praiseworthy? Suppose, gentlemen, that man is not stupid. (Really, it is quite impossible to say he is, for the sole reason that if he is stupid, who then is intelligent?) But even if he isn't stupid, all the same he's monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. I even think the best definition of man is: a being that goes on two legs and is ungrateful. But that's still not all; that's still not his chief defect; his chiefest defect is his constant lack of good behavior – constant from the great flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period of man's destiny. Lack of good behavior and, consequently, lack of good sense; for it has long been known that lack of good sense comes from nothing else but the lack of good behavior. Try casting a glance at the history of mankind; well, what will you see? Majestic? Maybe it is majestic; the Colossus of Rhodes alone, for example, is worth something! Not without reason did Mr Anaevsky[18] testify that while some say it was the work of human hands, others insist it was created by nature itself. Colorful? Maybe it is colorful; one need only sort through the full-dress military and civil uniforms of all times and all peoples – that alone is worth something, and if you were to add the uniforms of the lower civil ranks, you could really break a leg; no historian would be left standing. Monotonous? Well, maybe also monotonous: they fight and fight, they fight now, and fought before, and fought afterwards – you'll agree it's even all too monotonous. In short, anything can be said about world history, anything that might just enter the head of the most disturbed imagination. Only one thing cannot be said – that it is sensible. You'd choke on the first word. And one even comes upon this sort of thing all the time: there constantly appear in life people of such good behavior and good sense, such sages and lovers of mankind, as precisely make it their goal to spend their entire lives in the best-behaved and most sensible way possible, to become, so to speak, a light for their neighbors, essentially in order to prove to them that one can indeed live in the world as a person of good behavior and good sense. And what then? It is known that sooner or later, towards the end of their lives, many of these lovers have betrayed themselves, producing some anecdote, sometimes even of the most indecent sort. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man as a being endowed with such strange qualities? Shower him with all earthly blessings, drown him in happiness completely, over his head, so that only bubbles pop up on the surface of happiness, as on water; give him such economic satisfaction that he no longer has anything left to do at all except sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry about the noncessation of world history – and it is here, just here, that he, this man, out of sheer ingratitude, out of sheer lampoonery, will do something nasty. He will even risk his gingerbread, and wish on purpose for the most pernicious nonsense, the most noneconomical meaninglessness, solely in order to mix into all this positive good sense his own pernicious, fantastical element. It is precisely his fantastic dreams, his most banal stupidity, that he will wish to keep hold of, with the sole purpose of confirming to himself (as if it were so very necessary) that human beings are still human beings and not piano keys, which, though played upon with their own hands by the laws of nature themselves, are in danger of being played so much that outside the calendar it will be impossible to want anything. And more than that: even if it should indeed turn out that he is a piano key, if it were even proved to him mathematically and by natural science, he would still not come to reason, but would do something contrary on purpose, solely out of ingratitude alone; essentially to have his own way. And if he finds himself without means – he will invent destruction and chaos, he will invent all kinds of suffering, and still have his own way! He will launch a curse upon the world, and since man alone is able to curse (that being his privilege, which chiefly distinguishes him from other animals), he may achieve his end by the curse alone – that is, indeed satisfy himself that he is a man and not a piano key! If you say that all this, the chaos and darkness and cursing, can also be calculated according to a little table, so that the mere possibility of a prior calculation will put a stop to it all and reason will claim its own – then he will deliberately go mad for the occasion, so as to do without reason and still have his own way! I believe in this, I will answer for this, because the whole human enterprise seems indeed to consist in man's proving to himself every moment that he is a man and not a sprig! With his own skin if need be, but proving it; by troglodytism if need be, but proving it. And how not sin after that , how not boast that this has still not come about, and that wanting so far still depends on the devil knows what . . .","Yes, but that’s just where the snag is for me! Gentlemen, please excuse me for carrying my philosophizing to such absurd lengths – forty years underground, after all! Let me give my fancy free rein. You see, gentlemen, reason is a good thing, that can’t be disputed, but reason is only reason and satisfies only man’s intellectual faculties, while volition is a manifestation of the whole of life, I mean of the whole of human life including both reason and speculation. And although in this manifestation life frequently turns out to be rubbishy, all the same it is life and not merely the extraction of a square root. After all, I, for example, quite naturally want to live so as to fulfil my whole capacity for living, and not so as to satisfy simply and solely my intellectual capacity, which is only one-twentieth of my whole capacity for living. What does reason know? Reason knows only what it has succeeded in finding out (and perhaps there are some things it will never find out; there may be no consolation in this idea, but why not express it?), but man’s nature acts as one whole, with everything that is in it, conscious or unconscious, and although it is nonsensical, yet it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are sorry for me; you keep telling me that an enlightened and fully developed human being, in short one like the human being of the future, cannot knowingly will something that is bad for him, and that this is mathematics. I quite agree, it really is a mathematical certainty. But I repeat for the hundredth time that there is one case, and only one, when a man can consciously and purposely desire for himself what is positively harmful and stupid, even the very height of stupidity, and that is when he claims the right to desire even the height of stupidity and not be bound by the obligation of wanting only what is sensible. After all, this height of stupidity, this whim, may be for us, gentlemen, the greatest benefit on earth, especially in some cases. And in particular it may be the greatest of all benefits even when it does us obvious harm and contradicts our reason’s soundest conclusions on the subject of what is beneficial – because it does at any rate preserve what is dear and extremely important to us , that is our personality and our individuality. Some would assert that it is indeed what is dearest of all to man; volition can of course coincide with reason, if it likes, especially if it doesn’t abuse reason but uses it in moderation; this is wholesome and sometimes even laudable. But very often, perhaps more often than not, volition clashes directly and obstinately with reason, and… and… and, do you know, this too is wholesome and sometimes even laudable. Gentlemen, let us assume that man is not stupid. (Really, you know, it is quite impossible to say that he is, if only because after all, if he is stupid who can be clever?) But if he isn’t stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful, all the same. He is phenomenally ungrateful. I even think that the best definition of man is: a creature that has two legs and no sense of gratitude. But that isn’t all; it isn’t even his greatest defect; his greatest defect is his constant misbehaviour, constant from the time of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period of human destiny. Misbehaviour, and hence misreasoning; for it has long been well known that misreasoning arises from nothing but misbehaviour. Test it; cast a glance over the history of mankind: what do you see? Sublimity? Well, perhaps even sublimity; how much value the Colossus of Rhodes alone has, for example! It is not for nothing that Mr Anaevsky testifies that while some say it is the work of human hands, others assert that it was created by Nature herself. Variety? Perhaps variety too; study only the full-dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all nations in all ages – and what that alone amounts to! as for undress uniforms, they are uncountable: not a single historian could cope with them. Monotony? Well, perhaps monotony also: fighting, fighting, all the time; there was always fighting going on, and it had gone on before, and it went on afterwards – one must agree that it was monotonous to excess. In short, anything can be said of world history, anything conceivable even by the most disordered imagination. There is only one thing that you can’t say – that it had anything to do with reason. The very first word would choke you. And here is something that is always cropping up: people are always appearing who are terribly sensible and moral, terribly sage, terrible lovers of the human race, who really set themselves, as the goal of their whole lives, to conduct themselves in the noblest and most rational manner and let their light shine before their neighbours, simply in order to prove to them that it is possible to live one’s life in this world both virtuously and rationally. And what then? It is notorious that sooner or later many of these philanthropists have towards the end of their life changed their nature and furnished material for an anecdote, sometimes of the most scandalous kind. Now I ask you, what can one expect of man, as a creature endowed with such strange qualities? Shower him with all earthly blessings, plunge him so deep into happiness that nothing is visible but the bubbles rising to the surface of his happiness, as if it were water; give him such economic prosperity that he will have nothing left to do but sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry about the continuance of world history – and he, I mean man, even then, out of mere ingratitude, out of sheer devilment, will commit some abomination. He will jeopardize his very gingerbread and deliberately will the most pernicious rubbish, the most uneconomic nonsense, simply and solely in order to alloy all this positive rationality with the element of his own pernicious fancy. It is precisely his most fantastic daydreams, his vulgarest foolishness, that he wants to cling to, just so that he can assert (as if it were absolutely essential) that people are still people and not piano-keys, as which they would be exposed to the threat of being so played on, even if it was by the laws of nature with their own hands, that they could not so much as want anything that was not tabulated in the almanacs. More than that: if men really turned out to be piano-keys, and if it was proved to them by science and mathematics, even then they would not see reason, but on the contrary would deliberately do something out of sheer ingratitude in order, in fact, to have their own way. And if they had not the means to do this, they would contrive to create destruction and chaos, invent various sufferings, and so still have their own way! They would launch curses upon the world, and since man alone can utter curses (it is his privilege and the thing that chiefly distinguishes him from the other animals), perhaps through cursing alone he would attain his end, to convince himself that he was a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, the chaos and darkness and cursing, could also be reduced to tables, so that the mere possibility of taking it into account beforehand would put a stop to it, and reason would still hold sway – in that case men would deliberately go mad, so as not to possess reason, and thus still get their own way! I believe this , I am prepared to answer for it, because it seems to me that the whole business of humanity consists solely in this – that a man should constantly prove to himself that he is a man and not a sprig in a barrel-organ! To prove it even at the expense of his own skin; to prove it even by becoming a troglodyte. And after that, how can I not offend against the rules, or refrain from expressing my satisfaction that all this hasn’t happened yet, and meanwhile the devil alone knows what the will is or what it depends on?","Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being over-philosophical; it’s the result of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there’s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can—by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage—for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important— that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual—from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that’s worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man’s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages—that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it’s monotonous too: it’s fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last—you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational. The very word sticks in one’s throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself—as though that were so necessary—that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object—that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated—chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it , I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don’t know?"

"— Так; не знаю, Лиза. Видишь: я знал одного отца, который был строгий, суровый человек, а перед дочерью на коленках простаивал, руки-ноги ее целовал, налюбоваться не мог, право. Она танцует на вечере, а он стоит пять часов на одном месте, с нее глаз не спускает. Помешался на ней; я это понимаю. Она ночью устанет — заснет, а он проснется и пойдет сонную ее целовать и крестить. Сам в сюртучишке засаленном ходит, для всех скупой, а ей из последнего покупает, подарки дарит богатые, и уж радость ему, коль подарок понравится. Отец всегда дочерей больше любит, чем мать. Весело иной девушке дома жить! А я бы, кажется, свою дочь и замуж не выдавал.","- So; I don't know, Lisa. You see: I knew one father, who was a strict, stern man, but he stood on his knees in front of his daughter, kissed her hands and feet, could not stop looking, really. She dances at the evening, and he stands for five hours in one place, he does not take his eyes off her. Obsessed with her; I understand it. She will get tired at night - she will fall asleep, and he will wake up and go sleepy to kiss her and baptize her. He himself walks in a greasy frock coat, stingy for everyone, but he buys from the last, rich people give gifts, and he will be happy if he likes the gift. The father always loves his daughters more than the mother. It's fun for a different girl to live at home! And I, it seems, would not marry my daughter.","“I just would; I don't know, Liza. You see: I knew a father who was a stern, severe man, but he was forever on his knees before his daughter, kept kissing her hands and feet, couldn't have enough of admiring her, really. She'd be dancing at a party, and he'd stand for five hours in the same spot, unable to take his eyes off her. He was mad about her; I can understand that. She'd get tired at night and go to sleep, and he would wake up and start kissing her and making the sign of the cross over her while she slept. He himself went around in a greasy jacket, was niggardly with everybody, but for her he'd have spent his last kopeck, he kept giving her rich presents, and what a joy it was for him if she liked the present. A father always loves his daughters more than a mother does. It's a delight for some girls to live at home! And I don't think I'd even give my daughter in marriage.”","‘I just would; I don’t know why, Liza. Listen: I knew a father who was a stern grim man, but he spent his whole life on his knees before his daughter, kissing her hands and her feet, lost in wonder and admiration. If she danced in the evening, he would stand in the same spot for five hours on end, never taking his eyes off her. He was mad about her: I can understand that. At night when she was tired and fell asleep, he would wake up and go to kiss and bless her sleepy head. He wore a dirty old frock-coat, he was tight-fisted with everybody else, but he would spend his last farthing on her; he gave her expensive presents, and it was sheer joy to him if his gift pleased her. A father always loves his daughters better than their mother does. Home is a happy place for some girls! I don’t think I should ever let my daughter get married.’","“I don’t know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her feet, he couldn’t make enough of her, really. When she danced at parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I should never let my daughters marry.”"
"Но посмотрев на меня спокойно с полминуты, он снова начал повертываться.","But after looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began to turn around again.","But he, having looked at me calmly for about half a minute, again began to turn around.",But after gazing at me calmly for half a minute he again began to turn away.,"After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round again."
"Тогда уже я начинал испытывать приливы тех наслаждений, о которых я уже говорил в первой главе. После же истории с офицером меня еще сильнее туда стало тянуть: на Невском-то я его и встречал наиболее, там-то я и любовался им. Он тоже ходил туда более в праздники. Он хоть тоже сворачивал с дороги перед генералами и перед особами сановитыми и тоже вилял, как вьюн, между ними, но таких, как наш брат, или даже почище нашего брата, он просто давил; шел прямо на них, как будто перед ним было пустое пространство, и ни в каком случае дороги не уступал. Я упивался моей злобой, на него глядя, и… озлобленно перед ним каждый раз сворачивал. Меня мучило, что я даже и на улице никак не могу быть с ним на равной ноге. «Отчего ты непременно первый сворачиваешь? — приставал я сам к себе, в бешеной истерике, проснувшись иногда часу в третьем ночи. — Отчего именно ты, а не он? Ведь для этого закона нет, ведь это нигде не написано? Ну пусть будет поровну, как обыкновенно бывает, когда деликатные люди встречаются: он уступит половину, и ты половину, вы и пройдете, взаимно уважая друг друга». Но так не было, и все-таки сворачивал я, а он даже и не замечал, что я ему уступаю. И вот удивительнейшая мысль вдруг осенила меня. «А что, — вздумал я, — что, если встретиться с ним и… не посторониться? Нарочно не посторониться, хоть бы даже пришлось толкнуть его: а, каково это будет?» Дерзкая мысль эта мало-помалу до того овладела мною, что не давала мне покоя. Мечтал я об этом беспрерывно, ужасно и нарочно чаще ходил на Невский, чтоб еще яснее себе представить, как я это сделаю, когда буду делать. Я был в восторге. Все более и более мне казалось это намерение и вероятным и возможным. «Разумеется, не совсем толкнуть, думал я, уже заранее добрея от радости, — а так, просто не посторониться, состукнуться с ним, не так, чтобы очень больно, а так, плечо о плечо, ровно на столько, сколько определено приличием; так что на сколько он меня стукнет, на столько и я его стукну». Я решился наконец совершенно. Но приготовления взяли очень много времени. Первое то, что во время исполнения нужно было быть в более приличнейшем виде и позаботиться о костюме. «На всякий случай, если, например, завяжется публичная история (а публика-то тут суперфлю:{30} графиня ходит, князь Д. ходит, вся литература ходит), нужно быть хорошо одетым; это внушает и прямо поставит нас некоторым образом на равную ногу в глазах высшего общества». С этою целью я выпросил вперед жалованья и купил черные перчатки и порядочную шляпу у Чуркина. Черные перчатки казались мне и солиднее, и бонтоннее,{31} чем лимонные, на которые я посягал сначала. «Цвет слишком резкий, слишком как будто хочет выставиться человек», и я не взял лимонных. Хорошую рубашку, с белыми костяными запонками, я уж давно приготовил; но задержала очень шинель. Сама-то по себе шинель моя очень была недурна, грела; но она была на вате, а воротник был енотовый, что составляло уже верх лакейства. Надо было переменить воротник во что бы ни стало и завести бобрик, вроде как у офицеров. Для этого я стал ходить по Гостиному двору и после нескольких попыток нацелился на один дешевый немецкий бобрик. Эти немецкие бобрики хоть и очень скоро занашиваются и принимают мизернейший вид, но сначала, с обновки, смотрят даже и очень прилично; а ведь мне только для одного разу и надо было. Спросил я цену: все-таки было дорого. По основательном рассуждении я решился продать мой енотовый воротник.","Then already I began to experience the tides of those pleasures, which I already spoke about in the first chapter. After the incident with the officer, I began to be drawn there even more strongly: it was on the Nevsky that I met him the most, and it was there that I admired him. He also went there more on holidays. Although he also turned off the road in front of the generals and in front of high-ranking persons, and also wagged like a loach between them, but he simply crushed such as our brother, or even cleaner than our brother; walked straight towards them, as if there was an empty space in front of him, and in no case did he give way. I reveled in my anger, looking at him, and ... embittered in front of him every time I turned. I was tormented that even on the street I could not be on an equal footing with him. “Why do you always turn first? I molested myself, in a furious hysteria, sometimes waking up at three o'clock in the night. Why are you and not him? After all, there is no law for this, because it is not written anywhere? Well, let it be evenly divided, as usually happens when delicate people meet: he will give up half, and you will give in half, and you will pass, mutually respecting each other. But it wasn’t like that, and still I turned off, and he didn’t even notice that I was yielding to him. And then a most amazing thought suddenly dawned on me. “But what,” I thought, “what if I meet him and ... do not step aside? Don’t step aside on purpose, even if you have to push him: what will it be like?” This impudent thought gradually took possession of me to such an extent that it gave me no rest. I dreamed about it incessantly, terribly, and deliberately went to the Nevsky more often in order to imagine even more clearly how I would do it when I did it. I was delighted. More and more, this intention seemed to me both probable and possible. “Of course, not quite a push,” I thought, already kind with joy in advance, “but just don’t step aside, bump into him, not so much that it hurts very much, but like that, shoulder to shoulder, exactly as much as is determined by decency; so that as much as he hits me, so much I will hit him. I finally made up my mind. But the preparations took a very long time. The first is that during the performance it was necessary to be in a more decent form and take care of the costume. “Just in case, for example, if a public story starts (and the audience is superfluous here: {30} the Countess walks, Prince D. walks, all literature walks), you need to be well dressed; it inspires and directly puts us in some way on an equal footing in the eyes of high society. To this end, I begged a salary in advance and bought black gloves and a decent hat from Churkin. The black gloves seemed to me both more solid and more bonton than the lemon ones, which I had tried at first. ""The color is too harsh, too like a person wants to show off,"" and I did not take the lemon ones. A good shirt, with white bone cufflinks, I had prepared a long time ago; but she delayed the overcoat very much. By itself, my greatcoat was very good, warm; but it was wadded, and the collar was raccoon, which was already the height of servility. It was necessary to change the collar at all costs and get a beaver, sort of like the officers. To do this, I began to walk around Gostiny Dvor and, after several attempts, set my sights on one cheap German beaver. These German beavers, although they wear them out very soon and take on the most miserable appearance, but at first, from a new thing, they even look very decently; And after all me only for one times and need to was. I asked the price: it was still expensive. After careful consideration, I decided to sell my raccoon collar.","I was then already beginning to experience the influxes of those pleasures of which I have already spoken in the first chapter. And after the story with the officer, I began to be drawn there even more strongly: it was on Nevsky that I met him most often, it was there that I admired him. He, too, used mostly to go there on holidays. And he, too, swerved out of the way before generals and persons of dignity, and he, too, slipped among them like an eel, but those of our sort, or even better than our sort , he simply crushed; he went straight at them as if there were an empty space before him, and on no occasion gave way to them. I reveled in my spite as I watched him, and . . . each time spitefully swerved out of his way. It tormented me that even in the street I simply could not be on an equal footing with him. ”Why is it invariably you who swerve first?” I kept nagging at myself, in furious hysterics, sometimes waking up, say, between two and three in the morning. ”Why precisely you and not him? There's no law that says so, it's not written anywhere? Well, then let it be equal, as is usual when men of delicacy meet: he can yield by half, and you by half, and so you will pass mutually respecting each other.” But it was never so, and I still kept swerving, and he did not even notice that I was giving way to him. And then a most astonishing thought suddenly dawned on me. ”What,” I fancied, “what if I meet him and . . . do not step aside? Deliberately do not step aside, even if I have to shove him – eh? how will that be?” This bold thought gradually took such possession of me that it left me no peace. I dreamed of it ceaselessly, terribly, and deliberately went more often to Nevsky, to picture more clearly how I was going to do it when I did it. I was in ecstasy. The intention seemed more and more probable and possible to me. ”Not really to shove him, of course,” I thought, growing kinder in advance from joy, “but just so, simply not to give way, to bump into him, not so very painfully, but so, shoulder against shoulder, only as much as decency warrants, so that exactly as much as he bumps me, I will also bump him.” I was, finally, completely decided on it. But the preparations took a very long time. First of all, at the time of the performance one had to look as decent as possible and see to one's attire. ”Just in case, supposing, for example, that a public incident should get started (and the public there is superflu:[30] a countess goes, Prince D. goes, the whole of literature goes), one must be well dressed; this makes an impression, and in some sense will put us straightaway on an equal footing in the eyes of high society.” To that end I asked for an advance on my salary and bought black gloves and a respectable hat at Churkin's. Black gloves, it seemed to me, were both more imposing and more in bon ton than the lemon-colored ones I had first presumed upon. ”The color is too striking, it's too much as if a man wants to make a show of himself,” and I did not buy the lemon ones. I had long since prepared a good shirt with white bone cufflinks; but I was very much detained by the overcoat. My overcoat was not bad at all in itself, it kept me warm; but it had a quilted cotton lining, and the collar was of raccoon, which constituted the height of lackeydom. It was necessary to change the collar at any cost and to acquire a beaver, something like what officers wore. For that I began walking about the Gostiny Arcade[31] and, after several attempts, set my sights on a cheap German beaver. Though these German beavers wear out very quickly and acquire a most measly look, at first, when new, they even seem quite decent; and I needed it for only one time. I asked the price: it was expensive even so. After some solid reflection I decided to sell my raccoon collar.","I had already begun to experience surges of those pleasures I spoke of in my first chapter. After the incident with the officer, I was even more strongly drawn to the Nevsky Prospect; it was there that I met him most often, there that I feasted my eyes on him. He also went there chiefly on holidays. Although he too moved aside for generals and important personages, and wriggled past them like an eel, he simply trampled over nobodies of my sort, or even rather better than my sort; he bore straight down on them as though there was a clear space in front of him, and never in any circumstances gave way. Observing him fed the fires of my resentment, and… resentfully, I moved out of his way every time. It was torture to me that even in the street I could not manage to be his equal. ‘Why are you invariably the first to give way?’ I nagged at myself sometimes, hysterical with rage, when I woke up at three o’clock in the morning. ‘Why is it always you, not him? There’s no law about it, is there? nothing on the statute-books? Well, then, let’s share and share alike, as usually happens when people of any delicacy meet: he partly gives way, and you give way an equal amount, and you pass one another in mutual respect.’ But it never happened like that: I was the one who stepped aside, and he never even noticed that I did so – and then I was struck by the most marvellous idea. ‘ What,’ I thought, ‘if I were to meet him and… not step aside? Deliberately refuse to step aside, even if it meant running into him? What about that, eh?’ This audacious notion took possession of me bit by bit, to such an extent that it gave me no peace. I dreamed of it, ceaselessly and vividly, and on purpose went oftener to the Nevsky Prospect, so that I could more clearly picture to myself how I would act when the time came. I was full of enthusiasm. More and more my intended action began to seem both likely and possible. ‘Of course, I shan’t exactly jostle him,’ I thought, already mollified in advance by my enjoyment of the idea, ‘but just… not get out of his way, brush against him, not painfully, but just shoulder to shoulder, exactly as much as is laid down by the conventions; so that I shall collide with him as much as he collides with me.’ At last my mind was completely made up. But the preparations took a great deal of time. The first thing was that when I carried out my plan I must look more respectable and take pains with my clothes. ‘In any case, if there is, for example, a scene in public (and there is enough public and to spare there: a countess walks there, and Prince D., and the whole literary world) , I must be well dressed; it makes a good impression, and puts us at once on an equal footing, in a way, in the eyes of good society.’ To this end I drew my salary in advance and bought black gloves and a decent hat from Churkin’s. Black gloves seemed to me both more respectable and more bon ton than the yellow ones that tempted me at first. ‘The colour is too glaring, looks too much as if a man is trying to be conspicuous,’ and I did not take the yellow gloves. I had had a good shirt, with white bone studs, ready for some time, but the question of an overcoat delayed me for a long time. My overcoat was not bad in itself, it kept me warm; but it was lined with wadding, and had a raccoon collar, which constituted the essence of flunkeydom. I must at whatever cost change the collar and buy instead a beaver one such as officers wore. For this purpose I began to frequent the arcades, and after a few attempts fixed my sights on a cheap imitation beaver. Although these imitation beavers very soon show signs of wear and begin to seem shabby, they look very nice at first, when they are new; and after all, I only needed it for one occasion. I asked the price: it was dear, all the same. After profound deliberation I decided to sell my raccoon collar.","Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I spoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt even more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly on holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated over my resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for him. It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an even footing with him. “Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the morning. “Why is it you and not he? There’s no regulation about it; there’s no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass with mutual respect.” But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon me! “What,” I thought, “if I meet him and don’t move on one side? What if I don’t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against him? How would that be?” This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly, and I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture more vividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was delighted. This intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible. “Of course I shall not really push him,” I thought, already more good-natured in my joy. “I will simply not turn aside, will run up against him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other—just as much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he pushes against me.” At last I made up my mind completely. But my preparations took a great deal of time. To begin with, when I carried out my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I had to think of my get-up. “In case of emergency, if, for instance, there were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the most recherché: the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the society.” With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at Tchurkin’s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves seemed to me both more dignified and bon ton than the lemon-coloured ones which I had contemplated at first. “The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take the lemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer’s. For this purpose I began visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive. After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar."

"«Да и не пустят ее, „мерзавку“! — думал я. — Их ведь, кажется, гулять-то не очень пускают, тем более вечером (мне почему-то непременно казалось, что она должна прийти вечером и именно в семь часов). А впрочем, она сказала, что еще не совсем там закабалилась, на особых правах состоит; значит, гм! Черт возьми, придет, непременно придет!»","“Yes, and they won’t let her in, the“ scoundrel ”! I thought. - After all, it seems they are not really allowed to go out, especially in the evening (for some reason it certainly seemed to me that she should come in the evening and precisely at seven o'clock). And by the way, she said that she had not yet completely enslaved there, she had special rights; it means um! Damn it, it will come, it will certainly come!”","“They won't even let the 'slut' come!” I thought. “They don't seem to allow them out much, especially in the evening” (for some reason it seemed certain to me that she must come in the evening, and precisely at seven o'clock). “Though she said she's not completely bound to them yet, she has some special privileges there; so – hm! Devil take it, she'll come, she's sure to come!”","‘Besides, they won’t let her come, a “fallen woman”,’ I thought. ‘I don’t think they let them go out much, least of all in the evening.’ (For some reason I was absolutely convinced that she would come in the evening, at exactly seven o’clock.) ‘On the other hand she said she wasn’t completely committed, she still kept a certain independence; so … h’m! Damn it all, she’ll come, she’ll certainly come!’","Besides, they won’t let her out, “the hussy!” I thought.

"Прошел, однако ж, день, другой, третий — она не приходила, и я начинал успокоиваться. Особенно ободрялся и разгуливался я после девяти часов, даже начинал иногда мечтать и довольно сладко: «Я, например, спасаю Лизу, именно тем, что она ко мне ходит, а я ей говорю… Я ее развиваю, образовываю. Я, наконец, замечаю, что она меня любит, страстно любит. Я прикидываюсь, что не понимаю (не знаю, впрочем, для чего прикидываюсь; так, для красы, вероятно). Наконец она, вся смущенная, прекрасная, дрожа и рыдая, бросается к ногам моим и говорит, что я ее спаситель и что она меня любит больше всего на свете. Я изумляюсь, но… „Лиза, — говорю я, — неужели ж ты думаешь, что я не заметил твоей любви? Я видел все, я угадал, но я не смел посягать на твое сердце первый, потому что имел на тебя влияние и боялся, что ты, из благодарности, нарочно заставишь себя отвечать на любовь мою, сама насильно вызовешь в себе чувство, которого, может быть, нет, а я этого не хотел, потому что это… деспотизм… Это неделикатно (ну, одним словом, я тут зарапортовывался в какой-нибудь такой европейской, жорж-зандовской, неизъяснимо благородной тонкости…). Но теперь, теперь — ты моя, ты мое созданье, ты чиста, прекрасна, ты — прекрасная жена моя.","However, a day passed, two, three - she did not come, and I began to calm down. I was especially encouraged and roamed after nine o’clock, I even sometimes began to dream and rather sweetly: “For example, I save Lisa, precisely by the fact that she comes to me, and I tell her ... I develop her, educate her. I finally notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don’t know, however, why I pretend; so, for beauty, probably). Finally, she, all embarrassed, beautiful, trembling and sobbing, throws herself at my feet and says that I am her savior and that she loves me more than anything in the world. I am amazed, but ... “Liza,” I say, “do you really think that I did not notice your love? I saw everything, I guessed, but I did not dare to encroach on your heart first, because I had influence on you and was afraid that you, out of gratitude, would deliberately force yourself to respond to my love, you yourself would forcibly evoke in yourself a feeling that you might maybe not, but I didn’t want it, because it’s… despotism… It’s indelicate (well, in a word, I was reporting here in some such European, Georges-and-Sandian, inexplicably noble subtlety…). But now, now - you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure, beautiful, you are my beautiful wife.","A day passed, however, then another, then a third – she did not come, and I began to calm down. I especially took heart and let myself go after nine o'clock, I sometimes even began to dream, and that quite sweetly: “I save Liza,” for example, “precisely through her coming to me, and my telling her . . . I develop her, educate her. I finally notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don't know, however, why I pretend; probably just for the beauty of it). At last, all confused, beautiful, trembling and weeping, she throws herself at my feet and says that I am her savior, and that she loves me more than anything in the world. I am amazed, but . . . ' Liza,' I say, 'can you really think I haven't noticed your love? I saw everything, I guessed, but I dared not presume first upon your heart, because I had influence over you and feared lest you, out of gratitude, might deliberately make yourself return my love, might call up by force a feeling that perhaps is not there, and I did not want that, because that is . . . despotism . . . It is indelicate'“ (well, in short, here I let my tongue run away with me in some such European, George-Sandian, ineffably noble refinement . . . ).[40] “‘But now, now – you are mine, you are my creation, you are pure, beautiful, you are – my beautiful wife.’”","One day passed, however, and a second, and a third – she did not come and I began to grow calmer. I became particularly cheerful and light-hearted after nine o’clock, and even began to indulge in soothing dreams; for example: ‘I save Liza by the mere fact that she comes to me and I talk to her…. I develop her, educate her. … Finally I notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand. (I don’t know, though, why I pretend, I just do – probably as an ornamental touch.) Finally, covered with confusion, beautiful, trembling and sobbing, she throws herself at my feet and declares that I am her saviour and she loves me better than anything else in the world. I am amazed, but…. “Liza,” I say, “do you really think I haven’t noticed your love? I saw everything, I guessed it all, but I did not dare trespass on your heart the first, because I have influence over you, and I was afraid you would deliberately make yourself respond to my love out of gratitude, trying to produce by force an emotion that perhaps does not exist, and I didn’t want that, because that is… despotism….

I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don’t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better than anything in the world.

"— Видишь, Лиза, — я про себя скажу! Была бы у меня семья с детства, не такой бы я был, как теперь. Я об этом часто думаю. Ведь как бы ни было в семье худо — все отец с матерью, а не враги, не чужие.

"Я знал, что говорю туго, выделанно, даже книжно, одним словом, я иначе и не умел, как «точно по книжке». Но это не смущало меня; я ведь знал, предчувствовал, что меня поймут и что самая эта книжность может еще больше подспорить делу. Но теперь, достигнув эффекта, я вдруг струсил. Нет, никогда, никогда еще я не был свидетелем такого отчаяния! Она лежала ничком, крепко уткнув лицо в подушку и обхватив ее обеими руками. Ей разрывало грудь. Все молодое тело ее вздрагивало, как в судорогах. Спершиеся в груди рыдания теснили, рвали ее и вдруг воплями, криками вырывались наружу. Тогда еще сильнее приникала она к подушке: ей не хотелось, чтобы кто-нибудь здесь, хоть одна живая душа узнала про ее терзание и слезы. Она кусала подушку, прокусила руку свою в кровь (я видел это потом) или, вцепившись пальцами в свои распутавшиеся косы, так и замирала в усилии, сдерживая дыхание и стискивая зубы. Я было начал что-то говорить ей, просить ее успокоиться, но почувствовал, что не смею, и вдруг сам, весь в каком-то ознобе, почти в ужасе, бросился ощупью, кое-как наскоро сбираться в дорогу. Было темно: как ни старался я, но не мог кончить скоро. Вдруг я ощупал коробку спичек и подсвечник с цельной непочатой свечой. Только лишь свет озарил комнату, Лиза вдруг вскочила, села и с каким-то искривленным лицом, с полусумасшедшей улыбкой, почти бессмысленно посмотрела на меня. Я сел подле нее и взял ее руки; она опомнилась, бросилась ко мне, хотела было обхватить меня, но не посмела и тихо наклонила передо мной голову.","I knew that I was speaking in a tight, formal, even bookish way; in a word, I could not do otherwise than ""exactly according to the book."" But that didn't bother me; I knew, I had a presentiment, that they would understand me, and that this very bookishness could further support the cause. But now, having achieved the effect, I suddenly chickened out. No, never, never have I witnessed such despair! She lay prone, her face firmly buried in the pillow, and wrapped around it with both arms. Her chest was torn apart. Her whole young body trembled as if in convulsions. The sobs choking in her chest pressed, tore at her, and suddenly burst out with cries and cries. Then she clung even more strongly to the pillow: she did not want anyone here, even one living soul, to know about her torment and tears. She bit the pillow, bit her hand into the blood (I saw it later), or, clutching her fingers into her unraveled braids, she froze in the effort, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I started to say something to her, to ask her to calm down, but I felt that I did not dare, and suddenly, all in a kind of chill, almost in horror, I rushed to feel my way, somehow hastily getting ready for the road. It was dark: no matter how hard I tried, I could not finish soon. Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole, unopened candle. As soon as the light lit up the room, Liza suddenly jumped up, sat down, and with a kind of contorted face, with a half-crazy smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to her senses, rushed to me, wanted to embrace me, but did not dare and quietly bowed her head in front of me.","I knew I'd been speaking stiffly, affectedly, even bookishly; in short, I couldn't speak any other way than “as if from a book.” But that didn't trouble me; I knew, I sensed that I'd be understood, and that this very bookishness might even help things along. But now, having achieved my effect, I suddenly turned coward. No, never, never before had I witnessed such despair! She was lying prone, her face buried deep in her pillow, which she embraced with both arms. Her breast was bursting. Her whole young body was shuddering as in convulsions. Suppressed sobs were straining, tearing her breast, and would suddenly burst out in wails and cries. Then she'd cling to her pillow even more: she did not want anyone there, not a living soul, to learn of her torment and tears. She bit the pillow, she bit into her hand till it bled (I saw it later), or, clutching her loosened braids, she would go stiff with effort, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I started to say something to her, to beg her to calm down, but felt I didn't dare, and suddenly, all in a sort of fever myself, almost horrified, I rushed gropingly, in haphazard haste, to get myself ready to go. It was dark: no matter how I tried, I couldn't finish quickly. Suddenly I touched a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole, unused candle. As soon as light shone in the room, Liza suddenly rose, sat up, and looked at me almost senselessly, with a somehow distorted face and a half-crazed smile. I sat down next to her and took her hands; she recovered herself, made a quick move as if to embrace me, but did not dare, and quietly bowed her head before me.","I knew that what I said was constrained and artificial, even bookish; in short, the only way I could talk was ‘like a book’, but that wasn’t what disturbed me ; I knew I should be understood and felt that my very bookishness might well be a help. But now that I had made my effort my nerve failed all at once. No, never, never had I witnessed such despair! She was lying face downwards, with her head buried in the pillow and her arms strained tightly round it. Her heart was bursting. Her whole young body shook as if she had a fever. Stifling sobs crowded into her breast until they forced their way out as wails and cries; at those moments she would press her face deeper into the pillow, for fear that any living soul in that place should know of her tears and agony. She bit the pillow, bit her hands until the blood came (as I saw later) or, desperately clutching the tangled braids of her hair, grew rigid with effort, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I tried to say something, to beg her to be calm, but soon realized that I simply dared not, and, trembling violently and almost terrified, began hurriedly groping about for my things, to get away somehow as quickly as possible. It was pitch dark, and try as I might I could not finish quickly. All at once my hand found a box of matches and a candlestick, with a whole new candle. As soon as the light filled the room Liza started up and sat gazing at me almost vacantly, with a half-crazy smile on her distorted face. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to her senses and flung herself towards me as if to put her arms round me, but she dared not, and could only hang her head in silence.","I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I could not speak except “like a book.” But that did not trouble me: I knew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness might be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was suddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing , then she pressed closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me."

"На другой день я уже опять готов был считать все это вздором, развозившимися нервами, а главное — преувеличением. Я всегда сознавал эту мою слабую струнку и иногда очень боялся ее: «Все-то я преувеличиваю, тем и хромаю», — повторял я себе ежечасно. Но, впрочем, «впрочем, все-таки Лиза, пожалуй, придет» — вот припев, которым заключались все мои тогдашние рассуждения. До того я беспокоился, что приходил иногда в бешенство. «Придет! непременно придет! — восклицал я, бегая по комнате, — не сегодня, так завтра придет, а уж отыщет! И таков проклятый романтизм всех этих чистых сердец! О мерзость, о глупость, о ограниченность этих „поганых сантиментальных душ“! Ну, как не понять, как бы, кажется, не понять?..» — Но тут я сам останавливался и даже в большом смущении.","The next day, I was again ready to consider all this nonsense, raging nerves, and, most importantly, an exaggeration. I was always aware of this weak point of mine and sometimes I was very afraid of it: “I exaggerate, that's why I lame,” I repeated to myself hourly. But, by the way, “however, Liza will probably come after all” - this is the refrain that concluded all my thoughts at that time. Before that, I was worried that I sometimes went into a rage. “Come! will surely come! - I exclaimed, running around the room, - if not today, then tomorrow he will come, and he will find it! And such is the damned romanticism of all these pure hearts! O abomination, o stupidity, o narrow-mindedness of these ""filthy sentimental souls""! Well, how not to understand, how, it seems, not to understand? .. ”- But here I myself stopped and even in great embarrassment.","The next day I was again prepared to regard it all as nonsense, frazzled nerves, and, above all – exaggeration. I was always aware of this weak link in me, and at times was very afraid of it: “I'm forever exaggerating; that's where I'm lame,” I repeated to myself at all hours. But nevertheless, “nevertheless, Liza may still come” – this was the refrain with which all my reasonings at that time concluded. I worried so much that I sometimes became furious. ”She'll come! She's sure to come!” I'd exclaim, running up and down my room. ”If not today, then tomorrow, but she'll find me! That's the cursed romanticism of all these pure hearts! Oh, the vileness, oh, the stupidity, oh, the narrowness of these 'rotten, sentimental souls'! How can one not understand, how indeed can one not understand . . .” But here I myself would stop, and even in great confusion.","The next day I was again prepared to see all this as rubbish, the result of frayed nerves and, above all, exaggeration. I have always recognized this as my weak point, and sometimes feared it greatly: ‘I always exaggerate, that’s my weakness,’ I constantly repeated to myself. Nevertheless, ‘Liza may still come, all the same,’ was the refrain that at that time always brought those internal discussions of mine to a close. I was so worried that at times I became almost frantic: ‘ She’ll come, she’s sure to come,’ I exclaimed, scurrying about the room, ‘tomorrow if not today, and she’ll find me! That’s what comes of the damned romanticism of all these “pure hearts”! Oh, the vileness, the stupidity, the narrowness of these “sentimental pagan souls”! Well, how could she fail to understand?

But, however, “Liza will very likely come all the same,” was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: “She’ll come, she is certain to come!” I cried, running about the room, “if not today, she will come tomorrow; she’ll find me out!

"Дома я, во-первых, всего больше читал. Хотелось заглушить внешними ощущениями все беспрерывно внутри меня накипавшее. А из внешних ощущений было для меня в возможности только одно чтение. Чтение, конечно, много помогало, — волновало, услаждало и мучило. Но по временам наскучало ужасно. Все-таки хотелось двигаться, и я вдруг погружался в темный, подземный, гадкий — не разврат, а развратишко. Страстишки во мне были острые, жгучие от всегдашней болезненной моей раздражительности. Порывы бывали истерические, со слезами и конвульсиями. Кроме чтения, идти было некуда, — то есть не было ничего, чтобы мог я тогда уважать в моем окружающем и к чему бы потянуло меня. Закипала, сверх того, тоска; являлась истерическая жажда противоречий, контрастов, и вот я и пускался развратничать. Я ведь вовсе не для оправдания моего сейчас столько наговорил… А впрочем, нет! соврал! Я именно себя оправдать хотел. Это я для себя, господа, заметочку делаю. Не хочу лгать. Слово дал.","At home, first of all, I read most of all. I wanted to drown out everything that constantly boiled inside me with external sensations. And from external sensations, only one reading was possible for me. Reading, of course, helped a lot - it excited, delighted and tormented. But at times it was terribly boring. Still, I wanted to move, and I suddenly plunged into the dark, underground, ugly - not depravity, but debauchery. Passions in me were sharp, burning from my constant painful irritability. The impulses were hysterical, with tears and convulsions. There was nowhere to go but reading—that is, there was nothing for me to respect then in my surroundings and to which I would be drawn. Boiled, moreover, melancholy; there was a hysterical thirst for contradictions, contrasts, and so I set about debauchery. I didn’t just say so much to justify my just now ...

I still wanted to move about, and so I'd suddenly sink into some murky, subterranean, vile debauch – not a great, but a measly little debauch. There were measly little passions in me, sharp, burning, because of my permanent, morbid irritability. I was given to hysterical outbursts, with tears and convulsions. Apart from reading I had nowhere to turn – that is, there was nothing I could then respect in my surroundings, nothing I would be drawn to. What's more, anguish kept boiling up; a hysterical thirst for contradictions, contrasts, would appear, and so I'd set out on debauchery. It is not at all to justify myself that I've been doing all this talking . . . But no! that's a lie! I precisely wanted to justify myself. I make this little note for myself, gentlemen.

That observation is made for my own benefit, gentlemen. I won’t lie. I have given my word…","In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading.

"Весь этот вечер, уже когда я и домой воротился, уже после девяти часов, когда, по расчету, никак не могла прийти Лиза, мне все-таки она мерещилась и, главное, вспоминалась все в одном и том же положении. Именно один момент из всего вчерашнего мне особенно ярко представлялся: это когда я осветил спичкой комнату и увидал ее бледное, искривленное лицо, с мученическим взглядом. И какая жалкая, какая неестественная, какая искривленная улыбка у ней была в ту минуту! Но я еще не знал тогда, что и через пятнадцать лет я все-таки буду представлять себе Лизу именно с этой жалкой, искривленной, ненужной улыбкой, которая у ней была в ту минуту.","All that evening, already when I returned home, already after nine o'clock, when, according to the calculation, Liza could not come in any way, I still imagined her and, most importantly, I remembered everything in the same position. It was precisely one moment of everything yesterday that seemed especially vivid to me: this was when I lit the room with a match and saw her pale, contorted face, with a martyr's look. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a twisted smile she had at that moment! But I didn't know then that fifteen years later I would still imagine Lisa with that miserable, twisted, unnecessary smile that she had at that moment.","That whole evening, when I'd already returned home, when it was already past nine and by my reckoning Liza simply could not come, I still kept imagining her, and I recalled her, mostly, in one and the same position. Namely, of all that had happened yesterday, I pictured one moment especially vividly: it was when I lighted up the room with a match and saw her pale, distorted face with its tormented eyes. And how pathetic, how unnatural, how twisted her smile was at that moment! But I did not know then that even after fifteen years I would still be picturing Liza precisely with the pathetic, twisted, needless smile she had at that moment.","All that evening, even after I had got home, even after nine o’clock, when it was plain that Liza could not possibly come, the thought of her still kept running in my head and, most important, always in one and the same condition. I mean that one moment out of all those I had lived through the day before kept presenting itself to me with especial clarity; that was the moment when I struck a match and saw her pale distorted face with its expression of martyrdom. How pitiful, how unnatural, how twisted her smile had been at that instant! I did not know then that even after fifteen years I should still go on seeing Liza in my imagination with the same pitiful, twisted, useless smile on her lips as she had worn at that moment.","All that evening, even when I had come back home, even after nine o’clock, when I calculated that Liza could not possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came back to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of torture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute."

"— Ну, так все-таки выгоды же, — перебиваете вы меня. — Позвольте-с, мы еще объяснимся, да и не в каламбуре дело, а в том, что эта выгода именно тем и замечательна, что все наши классификации разрушает и все системы, составленные любителями рода человеческого для счастья рода человеческого, постоянно разбивает. Одним словом, всему мешает. Но прежде чем я вам назову эту выгоду, я хочу себя компрометировать лично и потому дерзко объявляю, что все эти прекрасные системы, все эти теории разъяснения человечеству настоящих, нормальных его интересов с тем, чтоб оно, необходимо стремясь достигнуть этих интересов, стало бы тотчас же добрым и благородным, покамест, по моему мненью, одна логистика! Да-с, логистика! Ведь утверждать хоть эту теорию обновления всего рода человеческого посредством системы его собственных выгод, ведь это, по-моему, почти то же… ну хоть утверждать, например, вслед за Боклем, что от цивилизации человек смягчается,{10} следственно, становится менее кровожаден и менее способен к войне. По логике-то, кажется у него и так выходит. Но до того человек пристрастен к системе и к отвлеченному выводу, что готов умышленно исказить правду, готов видом не видать и слыхом не слыхать, только чтоб оправдать свою логику. Потому и беру этот пример, что это слишком яркий пример. Да оглянитесь кругом: кровь рекою льется, да еще развеселым таким образом, точно шампанское. Вот вам все наше девятнадцатое столетие, в котором жил и Бокль. Вот вам Наполеон — и великий, и теперешний.{11} Вот вам Северная Америка{12} — вековечный союз. Вот вам, наконец, карикатурный Шлезвиг-Гольштейн…{13} И что такое смягчает в нас цивилизация? Цивилизация выработывает в человеке только многосторонность ощущений и… решительно ничего больше. А через развитие этой многосторонности человек еще, пожалуй, дойдет до того, что отыщет в крови наслаждение. Ведь это уж и случалось с ним. Замечали ли вы, что самые утонченные кровопроливцы почти сплошь были самые цивилизованные господа, которым все эти разные Атиллы да Стеньки Разины{14} иной раз в подметки не годились, и если они не так ярко бросаются в глаза, как Атилла и Стенька Разин, так это именно потому, что они слишком часто встречаются, слишком обыкновенны, примелькались. По крайней мере, от цивилизации человек стал если не более кровожаден, то уже, наверно, хуже, гаже кровожаден, чем прежде. Прежде он видел в кровопролитии справедливость и с покойною совестью истреблял кого следовало; теперь же мы хоть и считаем кровопролитие гадостью, а все-таки этой гадостью занимаемся, да еще больше, чем прежде. Что хуже? — сами решите. Говорят, Клеопатра{15} (извините за пример из римской истории) любила втыкать золотые булавки в груди своих невольниц и находила наслаждение в их криках и корчах. Вы скажете, что это было во времена, говоря относительно, варварские; что и теперь времена варварские, потому что (тоже говоря относительно) и теперь булавки втыкаются; что и теперь человек хоть и научился иногда видеть яснее, чем во времена варварские, но еще далеко не приучился поступать так, как ему разум и науки указывают. Но все-таки вы совершенно уверены, что он непременно приучится, когда совсем пройдут кой-какие старые, дурные привычки и когда здравый смысл и наука вполне перевоспитают и нормально направят натуру человеческую. Вы уверены, что тогда человек и сам перестанет добровольно ошибаться и, так сказать, поневоле не захочет роднить свою волю с нормальными своими интересами. Мало того: тогда, говорите вы, сама наука научит человека (хоть это уж и роскошь, по-моему), что ни воли, ни каприза на самом-то деле у него и нет, да и никогда не бывало, а что он сам не более, как нечто вроде фортепьянной клавиши{16} или органного штифтика; и что, сверх того, на свете есть еще законы природы; так что все, что он ни делает, делается вовсе не по его хотенью, а само собою, по законам природы. Следственно, эти законы природы стоит только открыть, и уж за поступки свои человек отвечать не будет и жить ему будет чрезвычайно легко. Все поступки человеческие, само собою, будут расчислены тогда по этим законам, математически, вроде таблицы логарифмов, до 108 000, и занесены в календарь; или еще лучше того, появятся некоторые благонамеренные издания, вроде теперешних энциклопедических лексиконов, в которых все будет так точно исчислено и обозначено, что на свете уже не будет более ни поступков, ни приключений.","“Well, it’s still the same benefits,” you interrupt me. “Allow me, sir, we’ll explain later, and it’s not a pun, but that this advantage is remarkable precisely because it destroys all our classifications and constantly breaks all the systems compiled by lovers of the human race for the happiness of the human race. In a word, it interferes with everything. But before I tell you this advantage, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore boldly declare that all these excellent systems, all these theories of explaining to mankind its real, normal interests, so that, necessarily striving to achieve these interests, it would immediately become the same kind and noble, for now, in my opinion, one logistics! Yes, logistics! After all, to affirm at least this theory of the renewal of the entire human race through a system of its own benefits, because, in my opinion, this is almost the same ... well, at least to assert, for example, following Bockle, that a person softens from civilization, {10} consequently, becomes less bloodthirsty and less capable of war. Logically, it seems that he does. But before that, a person is addicted to the system and to an abstract conclusion, that he is ready to deliberately distort the truth, is ready not to see and hear not to hear, just to justify his logic. That's why I take this example, because it is too bright an example. Yes, look around: the blood is flowing like a river, and even merry in this way, like champagne. Here you have our entire nineteenth century, in which Buckle also lived. Here's Napoleon - both great and present. {11} Here's North America {12} - an eternal union. Here you have, finally, caricature Schleswig-Holstein...{13} And what does civilization soften in us? Civilization develops in a person only the versatility of sensations and ... absolutely nothing more. And through the development of this versatility, a person, perhaps, will still reach the point where he will find pleasure in the blood. After all, that's what happened to him. Have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders were almost entirely the most civilized gentlemen, for whom all these different Atillas and Stenka Razins {14} were sometimes no match, and if they are not as brightly conspicuous as Atilla and Stenka Razin, then this is precisely because they are too common, too common, become familiar. At the very least, civilization has made man, if not more bloodthirsty, then probably worse, more vile bloodthirsty than before. Previously, he saw justice in the bloodshed and, with a clear conscience, exterminated whom he should; but now, although we consider bloodshed an abomination, we are nevertheless engaged in this abomination, and even more so than before. What's worse? - decide for yourself. They say that Cleopatra {15} (pardon the example from Roman history) loved to stick gold pins in the breasts of her slaves and found pleasure in their screams and writhing. You will say that it was in times, relatively speaking, barbaric; that even now times are barbaric, because (also speaking relatively) and now pins are stuck; that even now a man, although he has sometimes learned to see more clearly than in barbarian times, is still far from being accustomed to act as reason and science indicate to him. But all the same, you are absolutely sure that he will certainly become accustomed when some old, bad habits completely pass away and when common sense and science completely re-educate and normalize human nature. You are sure that then the person himself will stop voluntarily making mistakes and, so to speak, willy-nilly will not want to make his will related to his normal interests. Not only that: then, you say, science itself will teach a person (although this is already a luxury, in my opinion) that he actually has neither will nor whim, and never has, but that he himself nothing more than something like a piano key {16} or an organ pin; and that, moreover, there are still laws of nature in the world; so that everything he does is done not at all according to his will, but by itself, according to the laws of nature. Consequently, one has only to discover these laws of nature, and a person will not be responsible for his actions, and it will be extremely easy for him to live. All human actions, of course, will then be calculated according to these laws, mathematically, like a table of logarithms, up to 108,000, and entered in the calendar; or better still, some well-intentioned publications will appear, like the present encyclopedic lexicons, in which everything will be so accurately calculated and indicated that there will be no more deeds or adventures in the world.","“Well, but it is a profit, after all,” you will interrupt me. I beg your pardon, sirs, but we shall speak further of it, and the point is not in a play on words, but in the fact that this profit is remarkable precisely because it destroys all our classifications and constantly shatters all the systems elaborated by lovers of mankind for the happiness of mankind. Interferes with everything, in short. But before naming this profit for you, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these beautiful systems, all these theories that explain to mankind its true, normal interests, so that, striving necessarily to attain these interests, it would at once become good and noble – all this, in my opinion, is so far only logistics! Yes, sirs, logistics! For merely to assert this theory of the renewal of all mankind by means of a system of its own profits – this, to my mind, is almost the same as . . . well, let's say, for example, the same as asserting, with Buckle, that man gets softer from civilization and, consequently, becomes less bloodthirsty and less capable of war.[12] Logically, it seems, that's what he comes up with. But man is so partial to systems and abstract conclusions that he is ready intentionally to distort the truth, to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, only so as to justify his logic. That's why I've chosen this example, because it is an all too vivid one. Why, look around you: blood is flowing in rivers, and in such a jolly way besides, like champagne. Take this whole nineteenth century of ours, in which Buckle also lived. Take Napoleon – both the great one and the present one. Take North America – that everlasting union. Take, finally, this caricature of a Schleswig-Holstein . . . [13] What is it that civilization softens in us? Civilization cultivates only a versatility of sensations in man, and . . . decidedly nothing else. And through the development of this versatility, man may even reach the point of finding pleasure in blood. Indeed, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost all been the most civilized gentlemen, to whom the various Attilas and Stenka Razins[14] sometimes could not hold a candle? And if they don't strike one as sharply as Attila or Stenka Razin, it is precisely because they occur too frequently, they are too ordinary, too familiar a sight. If man has not become more bloodthirsty from civilization, at any rate he has certainly become bloodthirsty in a worse, a viler way than formerly. Formerly, he saw justice in bloodshed and with a quiet conscience exterminated whoever he had to; while now, though we do regard bloodshed as vile, we still occupy ourselves with this vileness, and even more than formerly. Which is worse? — decide for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse this example from Roman history) liked to stick golden pins into her slave girls' breasts, and took pleasure in their screaming and writhing. You'll say that this was, relatively speaking, in barbarous times; that now, too, the times are barbarous because (again relatively speaking) now, too, pins get stuck in; that now, too, though man has learned to see more clearly on occasion than in barbarous times, he is still far from having grown accustomed to acting as reason and science dictate. But even so you are perfectly confident that he will not fail to grow accustomed once one or two old bad habits have passed and once common sense and science have thoroughly re-educated and given a normal direction to human nature. You are confident that man will then voluntarily cease making mistakes and, willy-nilly, so to speak, refuse to set his will at variance with his normal interests. Moreover: then, you say, science itself will teach man (though this is really a luxury in my opinion) that in fact he has neither will nor caprice, and never did have any, and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ;[15] and that, furthermore, there also exist in the world the laws of nature; so that whatever he does is done not at all according to his own wanting, but of itself, according to the laws of nature. Consequently, these laws of nature need only be discovered, and then man will no longer be answerable for his actions, and his life will become extremely easy. Needless to say, all human actions will then be calculated according to these laws, mathematically, like a table of logarithms, up to 108,000, and entered into a calendar; or, better still, some well-meaning publications will appear, like the present-day encyclopaedic dictionaries, in which everything will be so precisely calculated and designated that there will no longer be any actions or adventures in the world.","‘Well, but then it is still a good,’ you interrupt. By your leave, we will explain further, and the point is not in a play on words, but in the fact that this good is distinguished precisely by upsetting all our classifications and always destroying the systems established by lovers of humanity for the happiness of mankind. In short, it interferes with everything. But before I name this good, I want to compromise myself personally, and so I roundly declare that all these beautiful systems – these theories of explaining his best interests to man with the idea that in his inevitable striving to attain those interests he will immediately become virtuous and noble – are, in my opinion, nothing but sophistry! Really, to maintain the theory of the regeneration of the whole of mankind by means of a tabulation of his own best interests is in my opinion the same as… well, as to affirm with Buckle that civilization renders man milder and so less bloodthirsty and addicted to warfare. Logically, it appears that that ought to be the result. But man is so partial to systems and abstract deduction that in order to justify his logic he is prepared to distort the truth intentionally. This is why I take this example, because it is an extremely striking one. Look round you: everywhere blood flows in torrents, and what’s more, as merrily as if it was champagne. There’s our nineteenth century – and it was Buckle’s century too. There’s your Napoleon – both the great Napoleon and the present-day one. There’s your North America – the everlasting Union. There is finally your grotesque Schleswig-Holstein…. And what softening effect has civilization had on us? Civilization develops in man only a many-sided sensitivity to sensations, and… definitely nothing more. And through the development of that many-sidedness man may perhaps progress to the point where he finds pleasure in blood. In fact, it has already happened. Have you noticed that the most refined shedders of blood have been almost always the most highly civilized gentlemen, to whom all the various Attilas and Stenka Razins could not have held a candle? – and if they are not so outstanding as Attila and Stenka Razin, it is because they are too often met with, too ordinary, too familiar. At least, if civilization has not made man more bloodthirsty, it has certainly made him viler in his thirst for blood than he was before. Before, he saw justice in bloodshed and massacred, if he had to, with a quiet conscience; now, although we consider bloodshed an abomination, we engage in it more than ever. Which is worse? Decide for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse my taking an example from Roman history) liked to stick golden pins into the breasts of her slaves, and took pleasure in their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in barbarous times, comparatively speaking; that even today the times are barbarous because (again speaking comparatively) pins are still being thrust into people; and that even now man, although he has learnt to see more clearly than in the days of barbarism, is still far from having grown accustomed to acting as reason and science direct. But all the same you are quite sure that he will inevitably acquire the habit, when certain bad old habits have altogether passed away, and common sense and science have completely re-educated and normally direct human nature. You are convinced that then men will of their own accord cease to make mistakes and refuse, in spite of themselves, as it were, to make a difference between their volition and their normal interests. Furthermore, you say, science will teach men (although in my opinion this is a superfluity) that they have not, in fact, and never have had, either will or fancy, and are no more than a sort of piano keyboard or barrel-organ cylinder; and that the laws of nature still exist on the earth, so that whatever man does he does not of his own volition but, as really goes without saying, by the laws of nature. Consequently, these laws of nature have only to be discovered, and man will no longer be responsible for his actions, and it will become extremely easy for him to live his life. All human actions, of course, will then have to be worked out by those laws, mathematically, like a table of logarithms, and entered in the almanac; or better still, there will appear orthodox publications, something like our encyclopaedic dictionaries, in which everything will be so accurately calculated and plotted that there will no longer be any individual deeds or adventures left in the world.","“Yes, but it’s advantage all the same,” you will retort. But excuse me, I’ll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble—are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon—the Great and also the present one. Take North America—the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and absolutely nothing more. And through the development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls’ breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from intentional error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it’s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world."

"— Спасать! — продолжал я, вскочив со стула и бегая перед ней взад и вперед по комнате, — от чего спасать! Да я, может, сам тебя хуже. Что ты мне тогда же не кинула в рожу, когда я тебе рацеи-то читал: «А ты, мол, сам зачем к нам зашел? Мораль, что ли, читать?» Власти, власти мне надо было тогда, игры было надо, слез твоих надо было добиться, унижения, истерики твоей — вот чего надо мне было тогда! Я ведь и сам тогда не вынес, потому что я дрянь, перепугался и черт знает для чего дал тебе сдуру адрес. Так я потом, еще домой не дойдя, уж тебя ругал на чем свет стоит за этот адрес. Я уж ненавидел тебя, потому что я тебе тогда лгал. Потому что я только на словах поиграть, в голове помечтать, а на деле мне надо, знаешь чего: чтоб вы провалились, вот чего! Мне надо спокойствия. Да я за то, чтоб меня не беспокоили, весь свет сейчас же за копейку продам. Свету ли провалиться, или вот мне чаю не пить? Я скажу, что свету провалиться, а чтоб мне чай всегда пить. Знала ль ты это, или нет? Ну, а я вот знаю, что я мерзавец, подлец, себялюбец, лентяй. Я вот дрожал эти три дня от страха, что ты придешь. А знаешь, что все эти три дня меня особенно беспокоило? А то, что вот я тогда героем таким перед тобой представился, а тут вот ты вдруг увидишь меня в этом рваном халатишке, нищего, гадкого. Я тебе сказал давеча, что я не стыжусь своей бедности; так знай же, что стыжусь, больше всего стыжусь, пуще всего боюсь, пуще того, если б я воровал, потому что я тщеславен так, как будто с меня кожу содрали, и мне уж от одного воздуха больно. Да неужели ж ты даже и теперь еще не догадалась, что я тебе никогда не прощу того, что ты застала меня в этом халатишке, когда я бросался, как злая собачонка, на Аполлона. Воскреситель-то, бывший-то герой, бросается, как паршивая, лохматая шавка, на своего лакея, а тот смеется над ним! И слез давешних, которых перед тобой я, как пристыженная баба, не мог удержать, никогда тебе не прощу! И того, в чем теперь тебе признаюсь, тоже никогда тебе не прощу! Да, — ты, одна ты за все это ответить должна, потому что ты так подвернулась, потому что я мерзавец, потому что я самый гадкий, самый смешной, самый мелочной, самый глупый, самый завистливый из всех на земле червяков, которые вовсе не лучше меня, но которые, черт знает отчего, никогда не конфузятся; а вот я так всю жизнь от всякой гниды буду щелчки получать — и это моя черта! Да какое мне дело до того, что ты этого ничего не поймешь! И какое, ну какое, какое дело мне до тебя и до того, погибаешь ты там или нет? Да понимаешь ли ты, как я теперь, высказав тебе это, тебя ненавидеть буду за то, что ты тут была и слушала? Ведь человек раз в жизни только так высказывается, да и то в истерике!.. Чего ж тебе еще? Чего ж ты еще, после всего этого, торчишь передо мной, мучаешь меня, не уходишь?","— Rescue! I continued, jumping up from my chair and running up and down the room in front of her. Yes, maybe I'm worse than you. Why didn’t you throw me in the face at the same time, when I read races to you: “And you, they say, why did you come to us yourself? Moral, or what, to read? I needed power, I needed power then, I needed games, I had to achieve your tears, humiliation, your hysteria - that's what I needed then! After all, I couldn’t bear it myself then, because I was rubbish, got scared, and the devil knows why I gave you the address foolishly. So then, before I even got home, I scolded you for what the world stands for this address. I already hated you because I lied to you then. Because I only play with words, dream in my head, but in reality I need, you know what: so that you fail, that's what! I need peace. Yes, I’m in favor of not being disturbed, I’ll sell the whole world right now for a penny. Will the light fail, or should I not drink tea? I will say that the light will fail, but that I always drink tea. Did you know this or not? Well, I now know that I am a scoundrel, a scoundrel, a selfish, lazy person. I've been trembling these three days from fear that you will come. Do you know what has been bothering me all these three days? And the fact that I then introduced myself to you as such a hero, and then you suddenly see me in this torn robe, a beggar, ugly. I told you just now that I am not ashamed of my poverty; so know that I am ashamed, most of all I am ashamed, most of all I am afraid, even more than that, if I steal, because I am conceited as if my skin was torn off, and it hurts me from the mere air. Haven't you realized even now that I'll never forgive you for catching me in this dressing gown when I rushed like an evil dog at Apollo. The resurrector, a former hero, rushes like a mangy, shaggy mongrel at his lackey, and he laughs at him! And the tears of old, which before you I, like a shamed woman, could not hold back, I will never forgive you! And what I now confess to you, I will never forgive you either! Yes, you, you alone must answer for all this, because you turned up like that, because I'm a bastard, because I'm the ugliest, the funniest, the most petty, the stupidest, the most envious of all worms on earth who are not at all better than me, but who, the devil knows why, will never be embarrassed; but all my life I will get clicks from any nits - and this is my trait! What do I care if you don't understand anything! And what, well, what, what do I care about you and whether you die there or not? Yes, do you understand how now, having told you this, I will hate you because you were here and listened? After all, a person only speaks like this once in his life, and even then in hysterics! .. What else do you need? Why else, after all this, are you sticking in front of me, torturing me, not leaving?","“To save you!” I went on, jumping up from my chair and running back and forth in front of her, “to save you from what! But maybe I'm worse than you are. Why didn't you fling it in my mug when I started reading you my oration: And you, what did you come here for? To teach us morals, or what?' Power, power, that's what I wanted then, the game was what I wanted, I wanted to achieve your tears, your humiliation, your hysterics – that's what I wanted then! But I couldn't stand it myself, because I'm trash, I got all scared and, like a fool, gave you my address, devil knows why. And afterwards, even before I got home, I was already cursing you up and down for that address. I already hated you, because I'd lied to you then. Because I only talk a good game, I only dream in my head, but do you know what I want in reality? That you all go to hell , that's what! I want peace. I'd sell the whole world for a kopeck this minute, just not to be bothered. Shall the world go to hell, or shall I not have my tea? I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea. Did you know that or not? Well, and I do know that I'm a blackguard, a scoundrel, a self-lover, a lazybones. I spent these past three days trembling for fear you might come. And do you know what particularly bothered me all these three days? That I had presented myself to you as such a hero then, and now you'd suddenly see me in this torn old dressing gown, abject, vile. I just told you I was not ashamed of my poverty, know, then, that I am ashamed, I'm ashamed of it most of all, afraid of it more than anything, more than of being a thief, because I'm so vain it's as if I'd been flayed and the very air hurts me. But can you possibly not have realized even now that I will never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing gown, as I was hurling myself like a vicious little cur at Apollon? The resurrector, the former hero, flinging himself like a mangy, shaggy mutt at his lackey, who just laughs at him! And those tears a moment ago, which, like an ashamed woman, I couldn't hold back before you, I will never forgive you! And what I'm confessing to you now, I will also never forgive you! Yes – you, you alone must answer for all this, because you turned up here, because I'm a scoundrel, because I'm the most vile, the most ridiculous, the most petty, the most stupid, the most envious of all worms on earth, who are in no way better than I, but who, devil knows why, are never embarrassed; while I will just go on being flicked all my life by every nit – that's my trait! Besides, what do I care if you won't understand a word of it! And what, tell me, what, what do I care about you and whether you're perishing there or not? Do you understand, now that I've spoken it all out to you, how I'm going to hate you for being here and listening? Because a man speaks out like this only once in his life, and then only in hysterics! . . . What more do you want? Why, after all this, do you still stick there in front of me, tormenting me, refusing to leave?”","‘Save you!’ I went on, jumping up from my chair and almost running backwards and forwards in front of her. ‘Save you from what? But I am perhaps worse than you. Why didn’t you fling the question in my face when I began preaching at you: “What did you come here for then? To teach us morality, I suppose?” It was power, power, I wanted then, the fascination of the game; I wanted to get your tears, your humiliation, your hysterics – that’s what I wanted then! It’s true that I couldn’t go through with it, because I’m trash, and I got scared and, God knows why, was fool enough to give you my address. Afterwards, even before I got home, I was already cursing you for all I was worth because of that address. I really hated you then, because I had lied to you. Because I only want to amuse myself a bit with words, to have a few dreams in my head, but in real life do you know what I want? for you to vanish , that’s what! I want to be left in peace. Just left undisturbed, I’d sell the whole world this minute for a copeck. For the whole world to vanish into thin air, or for me not to drink my tea? I say, let the world perish, if I can always drink my tea. Did you know that or not? Well, I know this: I’m a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egotist, a sluggard. For the last three days I’ve been shaking with fear that you would come. And do you know what worried me particularly all those three days? That I’d made myself out to be such a hero to you and now all at once you would see me in this ragged dressing-gown, poverty-stricken, repulsive. I said just now that I was not ashamed of being poor; let me tell you that I am ashamed of it, more ashamed than of anything else, I fear it more than anything else, more than being a thief, because I am so vain that it’s as if my skin had been flayed off and the very air was painful to me. Surely you must have guessed by now that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this disgraceful dressing-gown at a time when I was going for Apollon like a bad-tempered little cur. The saviour, the hero, flying at his servant like a mangy, neglected mongrel, while the servant laughs at him! And the tears that I could no more hold back just now than some old woman who’s been put to shame, I will never forgive you those! And I shall never forgive you for what I am confessing now, at this moment. Yes, you and you alone will have to answer for everything, because you turned up, because I am a cad, because I am the nastiest, most ridiculous, pettiest, stupidest, most envious of all the worms on this earth, who are none of them any better than me, but who, the devil only knows why, are never put out of countenance; but all my life any nit will be able to give me a fillip on the nose, and that’s my distinguishing feature! And what business is it of mine that you don’t understand a word of this? And what on earth has it to do with me whether you are perishing in that place or not? Do you understand how much I shall hate you for being here and hearing me tell you all this? After all, a man doesn’t talk like this more than once in a lifetime, and then only if he’s hysterical! … What more do you want? Why are you still here, tormenting me, after all that, why don’t you go?’","“Save you!” I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down the room before her. “Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than you myself. Why didn’t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you that sermon: ‘ But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read us a sermon?’ Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I wanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your hysteria —that was what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn’t keep it up then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already because of the lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I want peace; yes, I’d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you must realise that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either! Yes—you must answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am, but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to me that you don’t understand a word of this! And what do I care, what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it’s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics! ... What more do you want? Why do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don’t you go?”"

"Проснувшись наутро после нескольких часов глубокого, свинцового сна и тотчас же сообразив весь вчерашний день, я даже изумился моей вчерашней сантиментальности с Лизой, всем этим «вчерашним ужасам и жалостям». «Ведь нападет же такое бабье расстройство нервов, тьфу! — порешил я. — И на что это мой адрес всучил я ей? Что, если она придет? А впрочем, пожалуй, пусть и придет; ничего…» Но, очевидно, главное и самое важное дело теперь было не в этом: надо было спешить и во что бы ни стало скорее спасать мою репутацию в глазах Зверкова и Симонова. Вот в чем было главное дело.

What if she comes? However, why not, let her come; it's no matter . . .” But, obviously, that was not the main and most important thing now: I had to make haste and, whatever the cost, quickly save my reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov.

However, let her come; perhaps it doesn’t matter….’ But obviously, the chief and most urgent matter now was something different: I must make haste, at whatever cost and as soon as possible, to save my reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov. That was the main thing now. And in my fever of activity that morning I even forgot all about Liza.","Waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and immediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was positively amazed at my last night’s sentimentality with Liza, at all those “outcries of horror and pity.” “To think of having such an attack of womanish hysteria, pah!” I concluded. And what did I thrust my address upon her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it doesn’t matter.... But obviously, that was not now the chief and the most important matter : I had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible; that was the chief business.

"Я круто поворотил к Зверкову. Я был до того измучен, до того изломан, что хоть зарезаться, а покончить! У меня была лихорадка; смоченные потом волосы присохли ко лбу и вискам.","I turned sharply towards Zverkov. I was so exhausted, so broken, that even if I killed myself, I would be finished! I had a fever; sweat-soaked hair dried to the forehead and temples.","I turned sharply to Zverkov. I was so worn out, so broken, that I had to finish it even if it killed me! I was in a fever; my hair, wet with sweat, stuck to my forehead and temples.","I turned sharply towards Zverkov. I felt so exhausted, so shattered, that I had to end it if it killed me. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with sweat, had stuck to my forehead and temples as it dried.","I turned sharply to Zverkov. I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my throat to put an end to it. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with perspiration, stuck to my forehead and temples."
"Продолжаю спокойно о людях с крепкими нервами, не понимающих известной утонченности наслаждений. Эти господа при иных казусах, например, хотя и ревут, как быки, во все горло, хоть это, положим, и приносит им величайшую честь, но, как уже сказал я, перед невозможностью они тотчас смиряются. Невозможность — значит каменная стена? Какая каменная стена? Ну, разумеется, законы природы, выводы естественных наук, математика. Уж как докажут тебе, например, что от обезьяны произошел,{4} так уж и нечего морщиться, принимай как есть. Уж как докажут тебе, что, в сущности, одна капелька твоего собственного жиру тебе должна быть дороже ста тысяч тебе подобных и что в этом результате разрешатся под конец все так называемые добродетели и обязанности и прочие бредни и предрассудки, так уж так и принимай, нечего делать-то, потому дважды два — математика. Попробуйте возразить.","I continue calmly about people with strong nerves who do not understand the certain refinement of pleasures. These gentlemen, for example, in other incidents, although they roar like bulls at the top of their lungs, although this, let’s say, brings them the greatest honor, but, as I have already said, they immediately resign themselves to the impossibility. Impossibility means a stone wall? What stone wall? Well, of course, the laws of nature, the conclusions of the natural sciences, mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, for example, that he descended from a monkey, {4} there is nothing to frown at, take it as it is. As soon as they prove to you that, in essence, one drop of your own fat should be more valuable to you than a hundred thousand like you, and that as a result of this all the so-called virtues and duties and other nonsense and prejudices will be resolved in the end, so accept it, there’s nothing do something, because twice two is mathematics. Try to object.","I calmly continue about people with strong nerves, who do not understand a certain refinement of pleasure. In the face of some mishaps, for example, these gentlemen may bellow at the top of their lungs like bulls, and let's suppose this brings them the greatest honor, but still, as I've already said, they instantly resign themselves before impossibility. Impossibility – meaning a stone wall? What stone wall? Well, of course, the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science, mathematics. Once it's proved to you, for example, that you descended from an ape, there's no use making a wry face, just take it for what it is. Once it's proved to you that, essentially speaking, one little drop of your own fat should be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow men, and that in this result all so-called virtues and obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved, go ahead and accept it, there's nothing to be done, because two times two is – mathematics. Try objecting to that.[6]","I will go quietly on about the people with strong nerves, who don’t understand certain refinements of pleasure. These gentlemen, although they roar full-throatedly like bulls, and I suppose it does them the greatest credit, will on some occasions, as I have already said, calm down at once when they are faced with an impossibility. Impossibility is a stone wall. What do I mean by a stone wall? Well, of course, the laws of nature or the conclusions of the natural sciences or of mathematics. When it is proved, for example, that you are descended from an ape, it’s no use scowling about it – accept it as a fact. Or if it is demonstrated that half an ounce of your own fat ought essentially to be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this demonstration finally disposes of all so-called good deeds, duties, and other lunacies and prejudices, simply accept it; there’s nothing to be done about it, because twice two is mathematics. Just try to argue!","I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The impossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties and all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it, there is no help for it , for twice two is a law of mathematics. Just try refuting it."
"Не знаю, до сих пор еще не могу решить, а тогда, конечно, еще меньше мог это понять, чем теперь. Без власти и тиранства над кем-нибудь я ведь не могу прожить… Но… но ведь рассуждениями ничего не объяснишь, а следственно, и рассуждать нечего.","I don’t know, I still can’t decide, but then, of course, I could understand it even less than now. I can't live without power and tyranny over someone... But... but you can't explain anything by reasoning, and consequently, there's nothing to reason about.","I don't know, to this day I cannot decide, and then, of course, I was even less able to understand it than now. For without power and tyranny over someone, I really cannot live . . . But . . . but reasoning explains nothing, and consequently there's no point in reasoning.","I don’t know, I still can’t make up my mind, but then, of course I was still less able to understand it than I am now. Without power and tyranny over somebody I can’t live…. But… but after all, discussion won’t explain anything, and consequently there’s no point in discussing it.","I don’t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I cannot get on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ... there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason."
