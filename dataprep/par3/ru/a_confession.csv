"То же случилось и со мной. Я понял, что это – не случайное недомогание, а что-то очень важное, и что если повторяются все те же вопросы, то надо ответить на них. И я попытался ответить. Вопросы казались такими глупыми, простыми, детскими вопросами. Но только что я тронул их и попытался разрешить, я тотчас же убедился, во-первых, в том, что это не детские и глупые вопросы, а самые важные и глубокие вопросы в жизни, и, во-вторых, в том, что я не могу и не могу, сколько бы я ни думал, разрешить их. Прежде чем заняться самарским имением, воспитанием сына, писанием книги, надо знать, зачем я это буду делать. Пока я не знаю – зачем, я не могу ничего делать. Среди моих мыслей о хозяйстве, которые очень занимали меня в то время, мне вдруг приходил в голову вопрос: «Ну хорошо, у тебя будет 6000 десятин в Самарской губернии, 300 голов лошадей, а потом?..» И я совершенно опешивал и не знал, что думать дальше. Или, начиная думать о том, как я воспитаю детей, я говорил себе: «Зачем?» Или, рассуждая о том, как народ может достигнуть благосостояния, я вдруг говорил себе: «А мне что за дело?» Или, думая о той славе, которую приобретут мне мои сочинения, я говорил себе: «Ну хорошо, ты будешь славнее Гоголя, Пушкина, Шекспира, Мольера, всех писателей в мире, – ну и что ж!..»","The same happened to me. I realized that this is not an accidental ailment, but something very important, and that if the same questions are repeated, then they must be answered. And I tried to answer. The questions seemed so stupid, simple, childish questions. But as soon as I touched them and tried to resolve them, I was immediately convinced, firstly, that these were not childish and stupid questions, but the most important and profound questions in life, and, secondly, that I I cannot and cannot, no matter how hard I think, resolve them. Before you take up the Samara estate, raising your son, writing a book, you need to know why I will do this. Until I know why, I can't do anything. Among my thoughts about the economy, which greatly occupied me at that time, the question suddenly occurred to me: “Well, you will have 6,000 acres in the Samara province, 300 heads of horses, and then? ..” And I was completely taken aback and did not knew what to think next. Or, starting to think about how I would raise children, I said to myself: “Why?” Or, talking about how the people can achieve prosperity, I suddenly said to myself: “But what does it matter to me?” Or, thinking about the glory that my writings will gain me, I said to myself: “Well, you will be more glorious than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Molière, all the writers in the world - so what! ..”","That happened to me too. I understood that this was no casual exhaustion but something very important, and that if these same questions kept on being repeated, then one must answer them. And I tried to answer.

Before occupying myself with the Samara estate,12 the education of my son, the writing of a book , I had to know why I would be doing that. As long as I didn’t know why, I couldn’t do anything. As I thought about estate management, which engaged me a lot at that time, there would suddenly come into my head the question: “Very well, you’ll have sixteen thousand acres in the province of Samara, and three hundred horses, and then what?” I was completely thrown and didn’t know what more to think. Or starting to think about how I was educating my children, I would say to myself, “Why?” Or considering how the welfare of the people might be achieved, I suddenly would say to myself, “But what’s it to do with me?” Or thinking about the fame my works would bring me, I would say to myself, “Very well, you’ll be more famous than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Molière, than all the writers in the world—","This is just what happened to me.

Or, beginning to reflect on the education of my children, I would ask myself, ‘Why?’ Or deliberating on how the peasants might achieve prosperity I would suddenly ask myself, ‘What concern is it of mine?’ Or thinking about the fame my own writing brought me, I would say to myself, ‘Well fine, so you will be more famous than Gogol, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Molière, more famous than all the writers in the world, and so what?’"
"Я понимал это, но от этого мне было не легче.","I understood that, but that didn't make it any easier for me.",I UNDERSTOOD THIS BUT I HAD NO RELIEF FROM IT.,I could see this but it did not make matters any easier for me.
"Со мной случилось как будто вот что: я не помню, когда меня посадили в лодку, оттолкнули от какого-то неизвестного мне берега, указали направление к другому берегу, дали в неопытные руки весла и оставили одного. Я работал, как умел, веслами и плыл; но чем дальше я выплывал на середину, тем быстрее становилось течение, относившее меня прочь от цели, и тем чаще и чаще мне встречались пловцы, такие же, как я, уносимые течением. Были одинокие пловцы, продолжавшие грести; были пловцы, побросавшие весла; были большие лодки, огромные корабли, полные народом; одни бились с течением, другие отдавались ему. И чем дальше я плыл, тем больше, глядя на направление вниз, по потоку всех плывущих, я забывал данное мне направление. На самой середине потока, в тесноте лодок и кораблей, несущихся вниз, я уже совсем потерял направление и бросил весла. Со всех сторон с весельем и ликованием вокруг меня неслись на парусах и на веслах пловцы вниз по течению, уверяя меня и друг друга, что и не может быть другого направления. И я поверил им и поплыл с ними. И меня далеко отнесло, так далеко, что я услыхал шум порогов, в которых я должен был разбиться, и увидал лодки, разбившиеся в них. И я опомнился. Долго я не мог понять, что со мной случилось. Я видел перед собой одну погибель, к которой я бежал и которой боялся, нигде не видел спасения и не знал, что мне делать. Но, оглянувшись назад, я увидел бесчисленные лодки, которые, не переставая, упорно перебивали течение, вспомнил о береге, о веслах и направлении и стал выгребаться назад вверх по течению и к берегу.","It seems that this is what happened to me: I don’t remember when they put me in a boat, pushed me away from some unknown shore, showed me the direction to the other shore, gave oars into inexperienced hands and left me alone. I worked as best I could, with oars and swam; but the farther I swam to the middle, the faster became the current that carried me away from the goal, and the more and more often I met swimmers like me, carried away by the current. There were lone swimmers who continued rowing; there were swimmers who abandoned their oars; there were big boats, huge ships full of people; some fought with the current, others gave themselves to it. And the further I swam, the more, looking at the direction downstream, along the stream of all those floating, I forgot the direction given to me. In the very middle of the stream, in the cramped boats and ships rushing down, I already completely lost my direction and abandoned the oars. From all sides, with joy and jubilation, swimmers rushed downstream on sails and oars around me, assuring me and each other that there could be no other direction. And I believed them and swam with them. And I was carried far, so far that I heard the noise of the rapids in which I was to crash, and saw the boats crashed in them. And I came to my senses. For a long time I could not understand what had happened to me. I saw in front of me one destruction, to which I fled and which I was afraid of, I saw no salvation anywhere and did not know what to do. But, looking back, I saw countless boats that, without ceasing, stubbornly interrupted the current, remembered the shore, the oars and the direction, and began to row back upstream and towards the shore.","There happened to me something like this: I was put into a boat—I don’t remember when—pushed off from some shore I didn’t know, given a direction to the other bank, given oars into my untrained hands, and left alone. I toiled as best I could and rowed with the oars, but the further I rowed out into the middle, the faster became the current taking me away from my goal and the more often I came across rowers like myself carried away by the current. There were single oarsmen carrying on rowing; there were other rowers who had thrown away their oars; there were big boats, great ships full of people; some fought the current, others surrendered to it. And the more I rowed, the more I looked downstream at the streaming mass of all the rowers, I forgot the directions I had been given. In the very middle of the stream, in the throng of boats and ships being carried downstream, I completely lost my way and threw away my oars. On every side around me amid cheer and exultation they went on downstream by oar and sail, assuring me and each other that there could be no other way. And I believed them and went with them on the flow. And I was carried far, so far that I heard the noise of the rapids in which I would be wrecked, and I saw boats that had been wrecked in them. And I recovered my senses. For a long time I could not understand what had happened to me. Ahead of me I saw only the doom toward which I was speeding and of which I was frightened. I saw no salvation anywhere and I didn’t know what to do. But looking back I saw countless boats fighting against the current without stopping, I remembered the shore, the oars, and the directions, and I started to row back upstream and toward the shore.","Something like this happened to me: without remembering when I had been put into it, I found myself in a boat that had set off from some unknown shore. The direction to the opposite shore was shown to me, oars were put into my inexperienced hands, and I was left alone. I rowed as best I could and moved forwards, but the further I rowed towards the centre of the stream, the faster the current became that was carrying me directly away from my object, and I kept meeting more oarsmen like myself, who were being carried away by the current. There were lone oarsmen who continued to row; there were some who had discarded their oars; there were large rowing boats and enormous ships full of people, some struggling with the current, others abandoning themselves to it. And as I looked at the flow of those drifting downstream, I found that the more I rowed, the more I forgot the directions that had been given to me. In the very middle of the current, amid the crowd of boats and ships being pulled downstream, I lost my directions and abandoned my oars. From all directions people were being carried downstream by sail and oar, shouting for joy and assuring me and themselves that there could be no other direction. And I believed them and flowed with them. And I was carried a long way, so far that I could hear the noise of the rapids which were bound to shatter me, and I caught sight of boats that were already being smashed against them. Then I came to my senses. For a long time I could not understand what had happened to me. I saw nothing ahead of me except the destruction towards which I was rushing, but which I feared, and I could see no salvation anywhere, and I did not know what to do. But looking behind me I saw countless boats that could not stop but were defiantly pushing against the current, and I remembered the oars and the direction of the shore, and I began to struggle back against the current, towards the shore."
"Вообще отношение наук опытных к вопросу жизни может быть выражено так: Вопрос: Зачем я живу? – Ответ: В бесконечно большом пространстве, в бесконечно долгое время, бесконечно малые частицы видоизменяются в бесконечной сложности, и когда ты поймешь законы этих видоизменений, тогда поймешь, зачем ты живешь.","In general, the attitude of the experimental sciences to the question of life can be expressed as follows: Question: Why do I live? - Answer: In an infinitely large space, in an infinitely long time, infinitely small particles change in infinite complexity, and when you understand the laws of these modifications, then you will understand why you live.","In general the relation of the experimental sciences to the question of life can be expressed thus.

"Сказал я в сердце моем: дай испытаю я тебя веселием и наслаждусь добром; но и это – суета. О смехе сказал я: глупость, а о веселии: что оно делает? Вздумал я в сердце своем услаждать вином тело мое и, между тем как сердце мое руководилось мудростью, придержаться и глупости, доколе не увижу, что хорошо для сынов человеческих, что должны были бы они делать под небом в немногие дни своей жизни. Я предпринял большие дела: построил себе домы, насадил себе виноградники. Устроил себе сады и рощи и насадил в них всякие плодовитые дерева; сделал себе водоемы для орошения из них рощей, произращающих деревья; приобрел себе слуг и служанок, и домочадцы были у меня; также крупного и мелкого скота было у меня больше, нежели у всех, бывших прежде меня в Иерусалиме; собрал себе серебра, и золота, и драгоценностей от царей и областей; завел у себя певцов и певиц и услаждения сынов человеческих – разные музыкальные орудия. И сделался я великим и богатым больше всех, бывших прежде меня в Иерусалиме; и мудрость моя пребывала со мною. Чего бы глаза мои ни пожелали, я не отказывал им, не возбранял сердцу моему никакого веселия. И оглянулся я на все дела мои, которые сделали руки мои, и на труд, которым трудился я, делая их, и вот все – суета и томление духа, и нет от них пользы под солнцем. И оглянулся я, чтобы взглянуть на мудрость, и безумие, и глупость. Но узнал я, что одна участь постигает их всех. И сказал я в сердце своем: и меня постигнет та же участь, как и глупого, – к чему же я сделался очень мудрым? И сказал я в сердце моем, что и это – суета. Потому что мудрого не будут помнить вечно, как и глупого; в грядущие дни все будет забыто, и, увы, мудрый умирает наравне с глупым! И возненавидел я жизнь, потому что противны мне стали дела, которые делаются под солнцем, ибо все – суета и томление духа. И возненавидел я весь труд мой, которым трудился под солнцем, потому что должен оставить его человеку, который будет после меня. Ибо что будет иметь человек от всего труда своего и заботы сердца своего, что трудится он под солнцем? Потому что все дни его – скорби, и его труды – беспокойство; даже и ночью сердце его не знает покоя. И это – суета. Не во власти человека и то благо, чтоб есть и пить и услаждать душу свою от труда своего…","I said in my heart: let me test you with joy and enjoy goodness; but that too is vanity. About laughter I said: stupidity, but about joy: what does it do? I decided in my heart to delight my body with wine, and while my heart was guided by wisdom, to hold fast to foolishness until I see what is good for the sons of men, what they should do under heaven in the few days of their lives. I undertook great deeds: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself. He made for himself gardens and groves, and planted in them all sorts of fruitful trees; he made himself reservoirs for irrigation from them groves that grow trees; I bought myself servants and maids, and I had households; I also had more herds and flocks than all those who were before me in Jerusalem; collected for himself silver, and gold, and jewels from kings and regions; he got singers and female singers and delights of the sons of men - various musical instruments. And I became great and richer than all who were before me in Jerusalem; and my wisdom was with me. Whatever my eyes desired, I did not refuse them, did not forbid my heart any joy. And I looked back at all my works that my hands had done, and at the labor that I had labored in doing them, and behold, all was vanity and vexation of the spirit, and they were of no use under the sun. And I looked back to look at wisdom, and madness, and stupidity. But I learned that one fate befell them all. And I said in my heart: the same fate will befall me as a fool, why have I become very wise? And I said in my heart that this also is vanity. Because the wise will not be remembered forever, nor the fool; in the coming days all will be forgotten, and, alas, the wise die as well as the fool! And I hated life, because the deeds that are done under the sun became disgusting to me, for everything is vanity and vexation of the spirit. And I hated all my labor that I toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. For what will a man have from all his labor and the care of his heart, that he labors under the sun? Because all his days are sorrows, and his labors are restlessness; even at night his heart does not know peace. And this is vanity. It is not in the power of man that good is to eat and drink and delight his soul from his labor ...","“I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth and will rejoice in good deeds: and, behold, this also is vanity. I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me : I gathered me also silver and gold, and the jewels of kings and the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men—musical instruments of all sorts.

Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

For what hath man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath labored under the sun? For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. It is not given to a man to have the blessing that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor.","I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

"Ну, я знаю, – говорил я себе, – все то, что так упорно желает знать наука, а ответа на вопрос о смысле моей жизни на этом пути нет. В умозрительной же области я понимал, что, несмотря на то, или именно потому, что цель знания была прямо направлена на ответ моему вопросу, ответа нет иного, как тот, который я сам дал себе: Какой смысл моей жизни? – Никакого. – Или: Что выйдет из моей жизни? – Ничего. – Или: Зачем существует все то, что существует, и зачем я существую? – Затем, что существует.","Well, I know, - I said to myself, - everything that science so stubbornly wants to know, but there is no answer to the question about the meaning of my life on this path. In the speculative realm, however, I understood that, despite the fact, or precisely because the purpose of knowledge was directly aimed at answering my question, there is no answer other than the one that I myself gave myself: What is the meaning of my life? - None. Or: What will come out of my life? - Nothing. – Or: Why does everything that exists exist, and why do I exist? - Then what exists.","“Well, I know,” I said to myself, “everything that science so insistently wants to know, but on this path there is no answer to the question of the meaning of my life.” In the speculative sphere I understood that although, or precisely because, science’s aim was directed straight at the answer to my question, there was no other answer than the one I was giving myself : “What is the meaning of my life?” “None.” Or: “What will come out of my life?” “Nothing.” Or: “Why does everything exist that exists, and why do I exist?” “Because it exists.”","Well,’ I said to myself, ‘I know everything that science so urgently wants to know and along that path there is no answer to the question of the meaning of my life.

"И я обратился к изучению того самого богословия, которое я когда-то с таким презрением откинул как ненужное. Тогда оно казалось мне рядом ненужных бессмыслиц, тогда со всех сторон окружали меня явления жизни, казавшиеся мне ясными и исполненными смысла; теперь же я бы и рад откинуть то, что не лезет в здоровую голову, но деваться некуда. На этом вероучении зиждется, или, по крайней мере, неразрывно связано с ним, то единое знание смысла жизни, которое открылось мне. Как ни кажется оно мне дико на мой старый твердый ум, это – одна надежда спасения. Надо осторожно, внимательно рассмотреть его, для того чтобы понять его, даже и не то, что понять, как я понимаю положение науки. Я этого не ищу и не могу искать, зная особенность знания веры. Я не буду искать объяснения всего. Я знаю, что объяснение всего должно скрываться, как начало всего, в бесконечности. Но я хочу понять так, чтобы быть приведенным к неизбежно необъяснимому; я хочу, чтобы все то, что необъяснимо, было таково не потому, что требования моего ума неправильны (они правильны, и вне их я ничего понять не могу), но потому, что я вижу пределы своего ума. Я хочу понять так, чтобы всякое необъяснимое положение представлялось мне как необходимость разума же, а не как обязательство поверить.","And I turned to the study of the very theology that I had once dismissed with such contempt as unnecessary. Then it seemed to me a series of unnecessary nonsense, then I was surrounded on all sides by the phenomena of life, which seemed to me clear and full of meaning; now I would be glad to throw away that which does not fit into a healthy head, but there is nowhere to go. On this dogma rests, or at least is inextricably linked with it, that unified knowledge of the meaning of life, which was revealed to me. As wild as it may seem to me in my old firm mind, this is the only hope of salvation. We must carefully, carefully consider it in order to understand it, not even to understand it, as I understand the position of science. I am not looking for this and I cannot look for it, knowing the peculiarity of the knowledge of faith. I will not seek an explanation for everything. I know that the explanation of everything must be hidden, as the beginning of everything, in infinity. But I want to understand in such a way as to be led to the inevitable inexplicable; I want everything that is inexplicable to be so, not because the demands of my mind are wrong (they are correct, and outside of them I cannot understand anything), but because I see the limits of my mind. I want to understand in such a way that every inexplicable situation appears to me as a necessity of reason, and not as an obligation to believe.","And I turned to the study of that very theology I had once so scornfully rejected as superfluous. Then it had seemed to me a series of superfluous nonsense, then I had been surrounded on all sides by manifestations of life that I found clear and full of meaning; now I would have been glad to reject anything that didn’t fit into a healthy mind, but I couldn’t find a way for myself. The unified knowledge of the meaning of life that had been revealed to me was based on this Christian teaching, or at any rate indissolubly tied to it. However strange it might seem to my dull old mind this was the only hope of salvation. I had to examine it carefully, attentively, in order to understand it, and not even to understand it as I understood a proposition of science. I was not looking for that, and could not be looking for that, knowing the special nature of knowledge of faith. I was not going to look for the explanation of everything. I knew that the explanation of everything, like the origin of everything, must be hidden in infinity. But I wanted to understand in such a way as to be led to what has to be inevitably inexplicable, I wanted everything inexplicable to be so not because the demands of my intellect were wrong (they are right and I cannot understand anything without them) but because I saw the limitations of my intellect. I wanted to understand so that every inexplicable proposition appeared to me as the necessary consequences of reason but not as a duty of faith.","I turned to a study of that very theology I had once so contemptuously rejected as unnecessary. It had previously struck me as a collection of useless nonsense, this at a time when I had been surrounded by manifestations of life that I thought clear and full of meaning. Now I would have been glad to discard all those things that did not enhance health of mind, but I did not know what to do with myself. The one meaning of life that had been revealed to me rests on this religious doctrine, or is at least inseparably connected. However far-fetched it might seem to my old, infirm mind, it was the only hope of salvation. It must be carefully and attentively examined in order to be understood, even if it is not understood in the way I understand the propositions of science. I do not seek that, nor can I, since I know the unusual nature of religious knowledge. I shall not seek the explanation of everything. I know that the explanation of all things, like the origin of all things, must remain a secret of eternity. But I want to understand in such a way as to be brought to the inevitably inexplicable. I want to realize that all that is inexplicable is so, not because the demands of my intellect are at fault (they are correct and apart from them I can understand nothing), but because I can recognize the limits of my intellect. I want to understand in such a way that everything inexplicable presents itself to me as being necessarily inexplicable and not as being something that I am under an obligation to believe."
"И вспомнив то, как те же самые верования отталкивали меня и казались бессмысленными, когда их исповедовали люди, жившие противно этим верованиям, и как эти же самые верования привлекли меня и показались мне разумными, когда я видел, что люди живут ими, – я понял, почему я тогда откинул эти верования и почему нашел их бессмысленными, а теперь принял их и нашел полными смысла. Я понял, что я заблудился и как я заблудился. Я заблудился не столько оттого, что неправильно мыслил, сколько оттого, что я жил дурно. Я понял, что истину закрыло от меня не столько заблуждение моей мысли, сколько самая жизнь моя в тех исключительных условиях эпикурейства, удовлетворения похотям, в которых я провел ее. Я понял, что мой вопрос о том, что есть моя жизнь, и ответ: зло, – был совершенно правилен. Неправильно было только то, что ответ, относящийся только ко мне, я отнес к жизни вообще: я спросил себя, что такое моя жизнь, и получил ответ: зло и бессмыслица. И точно, моя жизнь – жизнь потворства похоти – была бессмысленна и зла, и потому ответ: «жизнь зла и бессмысленна» – относился только к моей жизни, а не к жизни людской вообще. Я понял ту истину, впоследствии найденную мною в Евангелии, что люди более возлюбили тьму, нежели свет, потому что дела их были злы. Ибо всякий, делающий худые дела, ненавидит свет и не идет к свету, чтобы не обличились дела его. Я понял, что для того, чтобы понять смысл жизни, надо прежде всего, чтобы жизнь была не бессмысленна и зла, а потом уже – разум для того, чтобы понять ее. Я понял, почему я так долго ходил около такой очевидной истины, и что если думать и говорить о жизни человечества, то надо говорить и думать о жизни человечества, а не о жизни нескольких паразитов жизни. Истина эта была всегда истина, как 2x2=4, но я не признавал ее, потому, что, признав 2x2=4, я бы должен был признать то, что я нехорош. А чувствовать себя хорошим для меня было важнее и обязательнее, чем 2x2=4. Я полюбил хороших людей, возненавидел себя, и я признал истину. Теперь мне все ясно стало.","And remembering how the same beliefs repelled me and seemed meaningless when they were professed by people who lived contrary to these beliefs, and how these same beliefs attracted me and seemed reasonable to me when I saw that people live by them, I understood why I then rejected these beliefs and why I found them meaningless, and now I accepted them and found them full of meaning. I realized that I was lost and how I was lost. I got lost not so much because I thought wrong, but because I lived badly. I realized that the truth was hidden from me not so much by the delusion of my thought, but by my very life in those exceptional conditions of epicureanism, satisfaction of lusts, in which I spent it. I realized that my question about what my life is, and the answer: evil, was absolutely correct. The only thing wrong was that I attributed the answer, which applied only to me, to life in general: I asked myself what my life was, and received the answer: evil and nonsense. And indeed, my life - the life of indulgence of lust - was meaningless and evil, and therefore the answer: ""life is evil and meaningless"" - applied only to my life, and not to human life in general. I understood the truth, later found by me in the Gospel, that people loved darkness more than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed. I realized that in order to understand the meaning of life, it is necessary, first of all, that life be not meaningless and evil, and only then - the mind in order to understand it. I understood why I walked around such an obvious truth for so long, and that if you think and talk about the life of mankind, then you need to talk and think about the life of mankind, and not about the life of a few parasites of life. This truth was always true, like 2x2=4, but I did not recognize it, because, having recognized 2x2=4, I would have to admit that I am not good. And feeling good for me was more important and obligatory than 2x2=4. I loved good people, hated myself, and I recognized the truth. Now everything became clear to me.","AND REMEMBERING THAT THESE VERY BELIEFS HAD repelled me and seemed to me meaningless when they were professed by people whose lives contradicted these beliefs, and how these very beliefs attracted me and seemed to me to make sense when I saw that people lived by them, I understood why I then had rejected these beliefs and why I had found them meaningless but now accepted them and found them full of meaning. I understood that I had erred and how I had erred. I erred not so much because I thought wrongly as because I lived badly. I understood that the truth was hidden from me not so much by the error of my thinking as by my life itself in the exclusive conditions of Epicureanism and of satisfying my lusts in which I spent it. I understood that my question of what is my life and the answer, evil, were quite right. What was wrong was just that the answer that only applied to me I applied to life in general: I asked myself what is my life and got the answer, evil and meaningless. And indeed my life—a life of pandering to lust—was meaningless and evil, and therefore the answer “life is evil and meaningless” applied only to my life and not to human life as a whole. I understood that truth I later found in the Gospels, that people loved darkness rather than the light because their actions were evil. For everyone whose actions are evil hates the light and does not go toward it so that his actions are not revealed. I understood that to understand the meaning of life, first life must not be meaningless and evil, then one can use reason to understand it. I understood why I had spent so long going about near such an obvious truth, and that if one is to think and speak about the life of mankind, then one must speak and think about the life of mankind but not about the life of a few parasites on life. This truth is always a truth, just as 2 × 2 = 4, but I did not recognize it, because in recognizing that 2 × 2 = 4, I would have had to recognize that I am not good. And to feel myself good was more important and compelling than 2 × 2 = 4. I came to love good people, hated myself, and I recognized the truth. Now everything became clear to me.","I remembered how these very beliefs repelled me and seemed devoid of any meaning when they were professed by people who lived in contradiction to them, and I remembered how these same beliefs attracted me and seemed sensible when I saw people living in accord with them; and I realized why I had rejected them and found them meaningless and why I now accepted them and found them full of meaning. I realized that I had been lost, and how I had become lost. I had strayed not so much because my ideas had been incorrect as because I had lived foolishly. I realized that I had been blinded from the truth not so much through my mistaken thoughts as through my life itself, which had been spent in satisfying desire and in exclusive conditions of epicureanism. I realized that my question as to what my life is, and the answer that it is an evil, was quite correct. The only mistake was that I had extended an answer that related only to myself to life as a whole. I had asked myself what my life was and had received the answer that it is evil and meaningless. And this was quite true, for my life of indulgent pursuits was meaningless and evil, but that answer applied only to my life and not to human life in general. I understood a truism that I subsequently found in the gospels: that people often preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil. For he who acts maliciously hates light and avoids it so as not to throw light on his deeds. I understood that in order to understand life it is first of all necessary that life is not evil and meaningless, and then one may use reason in order to elucidate it. I realized why I had for so long been treading so close to such an obvious truth without seeing it, and that in order to think and speak about human life one must think and speak about human life and not about the lives of a few parasites. The truth has always been the truth, just as 2 × 2 = 4, but I had not admitted it, because in acknowledging that 2 × 2 = 4 I would have had to admit that I was a bad man. And it was more important and necessary for me to feel that I was good than to admit that 2 × 2 = 4. I came to love good people and to loathe myself, and I acknowledged the truth. And then it all became clear to me."
"Так было и бывает, я думаю, с огромным большинством людей. Я говорю о людях нашего образования, говорю о людях, правдивых с самими собою, а не о тех, которые самый предмет веры делают средством для достижения каких бы то ни было временных целей. (Эти люди – самые коренные неверующие, потому что если вера для них – средство для достижения каких-нибудь житейских целей, то это уж наверно не вера.) Эти люди нашего образования находятся в том положении, что свет знания и жизни растопил искусственное здание, и они или уже заметили это и освободили место, или еще не заметили этого.","It has been and is, I think, with the vast majority of people. I'm talking about people of our education, I'm talking about people who are true to themselves, and not about those who make the very object of faith a means to achieve any temporary goals. (These people are the most fundamental unbelievers, because if faith for them is a means to achieve some worldly goals, then this is probably not faith.) These people of our education are in the position that the light of knowledge and life has melted an artificial building, and they either already noticed it and made room, or they haven't noticed it yet.","That was the case and still is, I think, with the great majority of people. I am talking about people with our kind of education; I am talking about people who are truthful with themselves, but not about those who make the very fact of faith a means of attaining some ephemeral goals. (These people are the most fundamental unbelievers, because if faith for them is a means of attaining some worldly goals, then that is certainly not faith.) People with our kind of education are in a position where the light of knowledge and life have dissolved artificial knowledge, and either they have noticed this and emptied that space or they haven’t yet noticed it.","Thus it has happened and still happens, I believe, with the great majority of people. I am speaking about people from our type of background, of people who are sincere with themselves, and not of those who use the profession of faith as a means of obtaining some kind of worldly aims. (These people are the most fundamental non-believers, for if faith is seen by them as a means of achieving various worldly aims, then it is certainly no longer faith.) People of our upbringing find themselves in a situation where the light of knowledge and of life have melted away an artificial edifice, and they have either failed to notice this and swept it away completely, or have simply failed to notice it as yet."
"Проверяя ход рассуждений разумного знания, я нашел его совершенно правильным. Вывод о том, что жизнь есть ничто, был неизбежен; но я увидал ошибку. Ошибка была в том, что я мыслил несоответственно поставленному мною вопросу. Вопрос был тот: зачем мне жить, т. е. что выйдет настоящего, не уничтожающегося из моей призрачной, уничтожающейся жизни, какой смысл имеет мое конечное существование в этом бесконечном мире? И чтоб ответить на этот вопрос, я изучал жизнь.","Checking the course of reasoning of reasonable knowledge, I found it to be absolutely correct. The conclusion that life is nothing was inevitable; but I saw an error. The mistake was that I thought inconsistently with the question I posed. The question was this: why should I live, that is, what will come of the real, not annihilating from my illusory, annihilating life, what is the meaning of my finite existence in this infinite world? And to answer this question, I studied life.","Testing the line of reasoning of rational knowledge, I found it quite correct. The conclusion that life is nothing was unavoidable, but I saw an error. The error lay in the fact that my thinking didn’t correspond to the question I had asked. The question was this: why do I live, that is, what is real and lasting that will come out of my illusory and impermanent life, what meaning does my finite existence have in this infinite world? And to answer this question I studied life.","As I checked this line of argument I found it to be entirely correct. The conclusion that life is nothing was inevitable, but I spotted a mistake. The mistake was that my thinking did not correspond to the question I had posed. The question was: why do I live? Or: is there anything that will remain and not be annihilated of my illusory and transitory life? Or: what meaning has my finite existence in an infinite universe? In order to answer this question I studied life."
"Слушал я разговор безграмотного мужика-странника о боге, о вере, о жизни, о спасении, и знание веры открылось мне. Сближался я с народом, слушая его суждения о жизни, о вере, и я все больше и больше понимал истину. То же было со мной при чтении Четьи-Минеи и Прологов; это стало любимым моим чтением. Исключая чудеса, смотря на них как на фабулу, выражающую мысль, чтение это открывало мне смысл жизни. Там были жития Макария Великого, Иоасафа-царевича (история Будды), там были слова Иоанна Златоуста, слова о путнике в колодце, о монахе, нашедшем золото, о Петре-мытаре; там история мучеников, всех заявлявших одно, что смерть не исключает жизни; там истории о спасшихся безграмотных, глупых и не знающих ничего об учениях церкви.","I listened to the conversation of an illiterate peasant wanderer about God, about faith, about life, about salvation, and the knowledge of faith was revealed to me. I approached the people, listening to their judgments about life, about faith, and I understood the truth more and more. The same thing happened to me when reading the Chetia Menaia and the Prologues; it became my favorite reading. Excluding miracles, looking at them as a plot expressing a thought, this reading revealed to me the meaning of life. There were the lives of Macarius the Great, Joasaph the Tsarevich (the story of Buddha), there were the words of John Chrysostom, the words about a traveler in a well, about a monk who found gold, about Peter the Publican; there is the history of the martyrs, all declaring one thing, that death does not exclude life; there are stories of illiterate, stupid and unaware of the teachings of the church who were saved.","I was listening to an illiterate peasant pilgrim talking about God, about faith, about life, about salvation, and knowledge of the truth was revealed to me.

There were the lives of Macarius the Great,18 Joseph the Prince (the story of Buddha), the writings of John Chrysostom,19 the story of the traveller in the well, of the monk who found gold, of Peter the Publican and the histories of the martyrs, all of whom proclaimed that death does not obliterate life; and there were the tales of illiterate and stupid men who found salvation, although they knew nothing about the teachings of the Church."
"Помню, это было раннею весной, я один был в лесу, прислушиваясь к звукам леса. Я прислушивался и думал все об одном, как я постоянно думал все об одном и том же эти последние три года. Я опять искал бога.","I remember it was early spring, I was alone in the forest, listening to the sounds of the forest. I listened and thought about the same thing, as I have been thinking about the same thing all the time these past three years. I was looking for God again.","I remember it was early spring; I was alone in the forest, listening to the sounds of the forest. I listened and kept thinking of one thing, just as I had thought constantly of one and the same thing during these last three years.

I was listening and concentrating my thoughts on the one thing I had been continuously thinking about over the last three years. Again I was searching for God.
А вот что говорит индийская мудрость.,And this is what Indian wisdom says.,And this is what Indian wisdom says:,"This is what an Indian sage says: ‘Saki-Muni, a young and happy Prince, from whom illness, old age and death had been kept secret, went out for a drive one day and saw a frightful, toothless, drivelling old man."
"Как ни странно, ни неимоверно непонятно кажется мне теперь то, как мог я, рассуждая про жизнь, просмотреть окружавшую меня со всех сторон жизнь человечества, как я мог до такой степени смешно заблуждаться, чтобы думать, что жизнь моя, Соломонов и Шопенгауэров есть настоящая, нормальная жизнь, а жизнь миллиардов есть не стоящее внимания обстоятельство, как ни странно это мне теперь, я вижу, что это было так. В заблуждении гордости своего ума мне так казалось несомненным, что мы с Соломоном и Шопенгауэром поставили вопрос так верно и истинно, что другого ничего быть не может, так несомненно казалось, что все эти миллиарды принадлежат к тем, которые еще не дошли до постижения всей глубины вопроса, что я искал смысла своей жизни и ни разу не подумал: «Да какой же смысл придают и придавали своей жизни все миллиарды, жившие и живущие на свете?»","Strange as it may seem, it seems incredibly incomprehensible to me now how, while talking about life, I could overlook the life of mankind surrounding me from all sides, how could I be so ridiculously mistaken as to think that my life, Solomon’s and Schopenhauer’s, is real. , a normal life, and the life of billions is a circumstance not worthy of attention, however strange it may seem to me now, I see that it was so. In the delusion of the pride of my mind, it seemed to me so undoubted that Solomon and Schopenhauer and I raised the question so truly and truly that nothing else could be, it seemed so undoubtedly that all these billions belonged to those who had not yet reached the comprehension of all depth. the question that I was looking for the meaning of my life and never once thought: “But what meaning do all the billions who have lived and still give to their lives in the world?”","However strange, however incredible and incomprehensible it now seems to me that in thinking about life I could ignore the life of mankind around me on all sides; that I could so ludicrously lose my way as to think that my life, the life of the Solomons and Schopenhauers, was the real, normal life; that the life of millions was something not worth attention; however strange that is to me now, I see that it was so. In the error of my mind’s pride, I thought it beyond question that I and Solomon and Schopenhauer had put the question so surely and truly that there could be no other; it seemed so beyond question that all those millions belonged to those who hadn’t yet got as far as understanding the whole depth of the question, that I searched for the meaning of my own life and never thought once, “ But what meaning did all the millions who have lived and are living give to their lives?”","It seems so strange to me now, so utterly incomprehensible, that in my reasoning of life I could have overlooked the life of humanity that surrounded me on all sides and that I could have been so ridiculously mistaken as to think that my life, and the life of Solomon and Schopenhauer, was the true, normal life, while the lives of millions was not worthy of attention. However strange it may seem now , I know it was so at the time. Amidst the wanderings of my conceited mind I felt certain that Solomon, Schopenhauer and myself had posed the question so honestly and exactly that there could be no two ways about it. I felt so certain that all these millions simply belonged to the category of those who had not yet penetrated the depths of the question, that as I searched for the meaning of my life it never once occurred to me to think: ‘What sort of meaning do all the millions who have lived, and do live in the world give to their lives?’"
"Главное же то, что вопрос мой личный: что я такое с моими желаниями? – оставался уже совсем без ответа. И я понял, что знания эти очень интересны, очень привлекательны, но что точны и ясны эти знания обратно пропорционально их приложимости к вопросам жизни: чем менее они приложимы к вопросам жизни, тем они точнее и яснее, чем более они пытаются давать решения на вопросы жизни, тем более они становятся неясными и непривлекательными. Если обратишься к той отрасли этих знаний, которые пытаются давать решения на вопросы жизни, – к физиологии, психологии, биологии, социологии, – то тут встречаешь поражающую бедность мысли, величайшую неясность, ничем не оправданную притязательность на решение неподлежащих вопросов и беспрестанные противоречия одного мыслителя с другими и даже с самим собою. Если обратишься к отрасли знаний, не занимающихся разрешением вопросов жизни, но отвечающих на свои научные, специальные вопросы, то восхищаешься силой человеческого ума, но знаешь вперед, что ответов на вопросы жизни нет. Эти знания прямо игнорируют вопрос жизни. Они говорят: «На то, что ты такое и зачем ты живешь, мы не имеем ответов и этим не занимаемся; а вот если тебе нужно знать законы света, химических соединений, законы развития организмов, если тебе нужно знать законы тел, их форм и отношение чисел и величин, если тебе нужно знать законы своего ума, то на все это у нас есть ясные, точные и несомненные ответы».","The main thing is that my question is personal: what am I with my desires? – remained completely unanswered. And I realized that this knowledge is very interesting, very attractive, but that this knowledge is accurate and clear in inverse proportion to its applicability to the questions of life: the less it is applicable to the questions of life, the more accurate and clear it is, the more they try to give solutions to questions life, the more they become obscure and unattractive. If you turn to that branch of this knowledge that tries to give solutions to the questions of life - to physiology, psychology, biology, sociology - then you will encounter a striking poverty of thought, the greatest ambiguity, an unjustified pretension to solve irrelevant questions and the incessant contradictions of one thinker. with others and even with yourself. If you turn to the branch of knowledge that does not deal with the solution of life's questions, but answers its own scientific, special questions, then you admire the power of the human mind, but you know in advance that there are no answers to the questions of life. This knowledge directly ignores the question of life. They say: “We have no answers to what you are and why you live, and we do not deal with this; but if you need to know the laws of light, chemical compounds, the laws of the development of organisms, if you need to know the laws of bodies, their shapes and the ratio of numbers and magnitudes, if you need to know the laws of your mind, then we have clear, accurate and undeniable answers.","The main thing was that my personal question— what exactly am I with my desires—remained completely without an answer.

If you turn to a branch of those sciences that try to give a solution to the questions of life—to physiology, psychology, biology, sociology—there you will find an astounding poverty of thought, a very great lack of clarity, completely unjustified claims to answer questions that lie outside their subject and neverending contradictions between one thinker and others, and even within himself.

They say, “We have no answers to ‘What are you?’ and ‘Why do you live?’ and are not concerned with this; but if you need to know the laws of light, of chemical compounds, the laws of the development of organisms, if you need to know the laws of bodies and their forms and the relation of numbers and quantities, if you need to know the laws of your own mind, to all that we have clear, precise, and unquestionable answers.”","The most important thing was that my own personal question, the question of what I am with all my desires, was left completely unanswered.

If we turn to those branches of knowledge that attempt to provide solutions to the questions of life, to physiology, psychology, biology and sociology, we encounter a startling poverty of thought, extreme lack of clarity and a completely unjustified pretension to resolve questions beyond their scope, together with continual contradiction between one thinker and another (or even with their own selves).

"И мне приходило в голову: а что, как я чего-нибудь еще не знаю? Ведь точно так поступает незнание. Незнание ведь всегда это самое говорит. Когда оно не знает чего-нибудь, оно говорит, что глупо то, чего оно не знает.

Ignorance always says this very thing. When it doesn’t know something, it says that what it doesn’t know is stupid.

After all, that is exactly how ignorance behaves. Ignorance always says what I am saying. When it does not know something it says that the thing it does not know is stupid.

"Вернувшись оттуда, я женился. Новые условия счастливой семейной жизни совершенно уже отвлекли меня от всякого искания общего смысла жизни.

Стремление к усовершенствованию, подмененное уже прежде стремлением к усовершенствованию вообще, к прогрессу, теперь подменилось уже прямо стремлением к тому, чтобы мне с семьей было как можно лучше.","When I returned from there, I got married. The new conditions of a happy family life have completely distracted me from any search for the general meaning of life.

"«Семья…» – говорил я себе; но семья – жена, дети; они тоже люди. Они находятся в тех же самых условиях, в каких и я: они или должны жить во лжи, или видеть ужасную истину. Зачем же им жить? Зачем мне любить их, беречь, растить и блюсти их? Для того же отчаяния, которое во мне, или для тупоумия! Любя их, я не могу скрывать от них истины, – всякий шаг в познании ведет их к этой истине. А истина – смерть.","""Family ..."" - I said to myself; but family - wife, children; they are people too.

And the truth is death.","‘The family…,’ I said to myself. But my family, my wife and children, are also human beings.

If I love them I cannot conceal the truth from them. Each step taken in knowledge leads them to this truth. And the truth is death."
"Отношение мое к вере теперь и тогда было совершенно различное. Прежде сама жизнь казалась мне исполненной смысла, и вера представлялась произвольным утверждением каких-то совершенно ненужных мне, неразумных и не связанных с жизнью положений. Я спросил себя тогда, какой смысл имеют эти положения, и, убедившись, что они не имеют его, откинул их. Теперь же, напротив, я твердо знал, что жизнь моя не имеет и не может иметь никакого смысла, и положения веры не только не представлялись мне ненужными, но я несомненным опытом был приведен к убеждению, что только эти положения веры дают смысл жизни. Прежде я смотрел на них как на совершенно ненужную тарабарскую грамоту, теперь же, если я не понимал их, то знал, что в них смысл, и говорил себе, что надо учиться понимать их.","My attitude to faith now and then was completely different. Previously, life itself seemed to me full of meaning, and faith seemed to be an arbitrary assertion of some completely unnecessary, unreasonable and unrelated propositions to me. I then asked myself what meaning these provisions had, and, convinced that they did not have it, I threw them aside. Now, on the contrary, I knew for sure that my life did not and could not have any meaning, and the positions of faith not only did not seem unnecessary to me, but I was led by undoubted experience to the conviction that only these positions of faith give meaning to life. Previously, I looked at them as completely unnecessary gibberish, but now, if I did not understand them, I knew that they made sense, and told myself that I had to learn to understand them.","My attitude to faith now and my attitude then were quite different. Previously life itself had seemed to me full of meaning and faith, as the arbitrary affirmation of some irrational propositions, seemed absolutely superfluous as far as I was concerned and with no connection to life. I asked myself then what meaning these propositions had and, convinced that they didn’t have any, rejected them. Now, on the contrary, I firmly knew that my life had no meaning and cannot have any, and the propositions of faith not only did not appear superfluous but I was led by unquestionable experience to the conviction that only these propositions of faith give meaning to life. Previously I regarded them as completely superfluous hieroglyphics; now if I didn’t understand them I still knew that in them was meaning and said to myself that I must learn to understand them.","My attitude to faith was now quite different from what it had been before. Formerly life had seemed full of meaning, and belief seemed to comprise an arbitrary confirmation of various completely unnecessary and irrational propositions that had nothing to do with life. At that time I asked myself what meaning these propositions could have and, convinced that they had none, I threw them aside. Now, on the contrary, I knew very well that my life has, and could have, no meaning. And not only did the tenets of faith cease to appear unnecessary to me, but I was led by indisputable experience to the conviction that it was only these tenets that can give meaning to life. I had formerly looked upon them as completely irrelevant double Dutch but now, even if I knew that I did not understand them, I knew there was meaning in them, and I told myself that I must learn to understand them."
"Исполняя обряды церкви, я смирял свой разум и подчинял себя тому преданию, которое имело все человечество. Я соединялся с предками моими, с любимыми мною – отцом, матерью, дедами, бабками. Они и все прежние верили и жили, и меня произвели. Я соединялся и со всеми миллионами уважаемых мною людей из народа. Кроме того, самые действия эти не имели в себе ничего дурного (дурным я считал потворство похотям). Вставая рано к церковной службе, я знал, что делал хорошо уже только потому, что для смирения своей гордости ума, для сближения с моими предками и современниками, для того, чтобы, во имя искания смысла жизни, я жертвовал своим телесным спокойствием. То же было при говении, при ежедневном чтении молитв с поклонами, то же при соблюдении всех постов. Как ни ничтожны были эти жертвы, это были жертвы во имя хорошего. Я говел, постился, соблюдал временные молитвы дома и в церкви. В слушании служб церковных я вникал в каждое слово и придавал им смысл, когда мог. В обедне самые важные слова для меня были: «возлюбим друг друга да единомыслием…» Дальнейшие слова: «исповедуем отца и сына и святого духа» – я пропускал, потому что не мог понять их.","Performing the rites of the church, I humbled my mind and subordinated myself to the tradition that all mankind had. I united with my ancestors, with my loved ones - father, mother, grandfathers, grandmothers. They and all the former ones believed and lived, and produced me. I connected with all the millions of people I respect from the people. Moreover, these actions themselves did not have anything bad in them (I considered indulgence to lusts to be bad). Getting up early for the church service, I knew that I was doing well only because in order to humble my pride of mind, to draw closer to my ancestors and contemporaries, so that, in the name of searching for the meaning of life, I would sacrifice my bodily peace. It was the same during fasting, during the daily reading of prayers with bows, the same when observing all fasts. No matter how insignificant these sacrifices were, they were sacrifices in the name of good. I used to eat, fast, observe temporary prayers at home and in church. In listening to church services, I delved into every word and gave them meaning when I could. At mass, the most important words for me were: “Let us love one another and with one mind…” Further words: “We confess the father and the son and the holy spirit” - I skipped because I could not understand them.","In performing the rituals of the church I restrained my reason and submitted to the tradition held by all mankind. I was united with my ancestors, with my loved ones—father, mother, grandfathers, grandmothers. They and those who had gone before believed and lived, and produced me. I was united too with all the millions from the ordinary people whom I respected. Besides, these actions in themselves had nothing wrong about them (I considered indulgence in lusts as wrong). Getting up early for a church service, I knew that I was doing good just because in order to humble my pride of mind, to draw closer to my ancestors and contemporaries, I was sacrificing bodily comfort for the sake of finding the meaning of life. That was the case with preparing for communion, with saying the daily prayers and performing the ritual prostrations, with observing all the fasts. However slight these sacrifices, they were sacrifices in the name of good. I prepared for communion, fasted, said the prayers at the appointed times at home and in church. Listening to the church services I uttered every word and gave them meaning when I could. In the Mass the most important words for me were: “Let us love one another of one mind . . .” The following words, “We believe in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,” I omitted because I could not understand them.","In fulfilling the church rituals I subdued my reason and submitted myself to a tradition shared by all mankind. I united myself with my ancestors and loved ones, with my father and mother, and grandfather and grandmother. They and all who came before them had believed and lived, and they had brought me into the world. And I joined those millions whom I so admired. Nor was there anything wrong in these acts in themselves (by wrong I mean the indulgence of desire). As I rose early in the morning to go to church I knew that I was doing something good, if only in that I was sacrificing my bodily comforts in order to subdue my proud mind, for the sake of unity with my ancestors and contemporaries, and of finding the meaning of life. It was the same when I prepared for communion and said my daily prayers, making the sign of the cross and genuflecting, as too when I fasted. However insignificant these sacrifices were, they were made for the sake of something good. I prepared for communion, I fasted and I observed the hours of prayer both at home and in church. While listening to the church services I paused at each word and whenever I could I gave it meaning. In the liturgy the most significant words for me were: ‘Love one another in unity.’ But further on I ignored the words: ‘We believe in the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost’, because I could not understand them."
"Оно было такое: Я, мой разум – признали, что жизнь неразумна. Если нет высшего разума (а его нет, и ничто доказать его не может), то разум есть творец жизни для меня. Не было бы разума, не было бы для меня и жизни. Как же этот разум отрицает жизнь, а он сам творец жизни? Или, с другой стороны: если бы не было жизни, не было бы и моего разума, – стало быть, разум есть сын жизни. Жизнь есть все. Разум есть плод жизни, и разум этот отрицает самую жизнь. Я чувствовал, что тут что-то неладно.","It was like this: I, my mind - recognized that life is unreasonable. If there is no higher mind (and there is none, and nothing can prove it), then the mind is the creator of life for me. If there were no reason, there would be no life for me. How then does this reason deny life, while it is the creator of life itself? Or, on the other hand: if there were no life, there would be no my mind, - therefore, the mind is the son of life. Life is everything. Reason is the fruit of life, and this reason denies life itself. I felt that something was wrong here.","It was this: I, my reason, recognized that life is contrary to reason. If there is no higher reason (and there isn’t and no one can prove it), then for me reason is the creator of life. If there were no reason, there would be no life for me. How can this reason deny life but be the creator of life? Or, looked at another way, if there were no life, my reason too wouldn’t exist—therefore reason must be the child of life. Life is everything. Reason is the fruit of life, and now this reason is denying life itself. I felt that there was something wrong here.","It was expressed as follows: I, that is my reason, have acknowledged that life is irrational. If there is nothing higher than reason (and there is not, and nothing can prove that there is), then reason is the creator of life for me. Without reason I can have no life. How then can reason deny life when it is the creator of it? Or looking at it another way: if there were no life my reason would not exist, which must mean that reason is the offspring of life. Life is everything. Reason is the fruit of life and yet this reason rejects life itself. I felt that something was not quite right here."
"Несмотря на эти сомнения и страдания, я еще держался православия. Но явились вопросы жизни, которые надо было разрешить, и тут разрешение этих вопросов церковью – противное самым основам той веры, которою я жил, – окончательно заставило меня отречься от возможности общения с православием. Вопросы эти были, во-первых, отношение церкви православной к другим церквам – к католичеству и к так называемым раскольникам. В это время, вследствие моего интереса к вере, я сближался с верующими разных исповеданий: католиками, протестантами, старообрядцами, молоканами и др. И много я встречал из них людей нравственно высоких и истинно верующих. Я желал быть братом этих людей. И что же? То учение, которое обещало мне соединить всех единою верою и любовью, это самое учение в лице своих лучших представителей сказало мне, что это всё люди, находящиеся во лжи, что то, что дает им силу жизни, есть искушение дьявола и что мы одни в обладании единой возможной истины. И я увидал, что всех, не исповедующих одинаково с нами веру, православные считают еретиками, точь-в-точь так же, как католики и другие считают православие еретичеством; я увидал, что ко всем, не исповедующим внешними символами и словами свою веру так же, как православие, – православие, хотя и пытается скрыть это, относится враждебно, как оно и должно быть, во-первых, потому, что утверждение о том, что ты во лжи, а я в истине, есть самое жестокое слово, которое может сказать один человек другому, и, во-вторых, потому, что человек, любящий детей и братьев своих, не может не относиться враждебно к людям, желающим обратить его детей и братьев в веру ложную. И враждебность эта усиливается по мере большего знания вероучения. И мне, полагавшему истину в единении любви, невольно бросилось в глаза то, что самое вероучение разрушает то, что оно должно произвести.","Despite these doubts and sufferings, I still adhered to Orthodoxy. But questions of life arose that needed to be resolved, and here the resolution of these questions by the Church—contrary to the very foundations of the faith by which I lived—completely forced me to renounce the possibility of communion with Orthodoxy. These questions were, firstly, the attitude of the Orthodox Church to other churches - to Catholicism and to the so-called schismatics. At this time, due to my interest in faith, I became close to believers of different confessions: Catholics, Protestants, Old Believers, Molokans, etc. And I met many of them people of moral high and true believers. I wanted to be the brother of these people. And what? The teaching that promised me to unite all by one faith and love, this very teaching, in the person of its best representatives, told me that these are all people who are in a lie, that what gives them the strength of life is the temptation of the devil, and that we are alone in possession of a single possible truth. And I saw that everyone who does not profess the same faith as us is considered heretics by the Orthodox, just as Catholics and others consider Orthodoxy heresy; I saw that to everyone who does not profess their faith with external symbols and words, just like Orthodoxy, Orthodoxy, although it tries to hide it, is hostile, as it should be, firstly, because the statement that that you are in a lie, and I am in the truth, is the most cruel word that one person can say to another, and, secondly, because a person who loves his children and brothers cannot but be hostile to people who want to convert him children and brothers into a false faith. And this hostility intensifies with greater knowledge of the dogma. And to me, who posited truth in the unity of love, it involuntarily struck me that the doctrine itself destroys what it should produce.","In spite of these doubts and suffering I still adhered to Orthodoxy. But questions of life arose that had to be answered, and here the answer to these questions by the church—one that was the opposite of the foundations of faith by which I lived—finally made me renounce the possibility of communion with Orthodoxy. These questions were firstly the attitude of the Orthodox church to other churches—to Catholicism and the so-called schismatics. At that time as a consequence of my interest in faith I became close to believers of various denominations: to Catholics, Protestants, Old Believers, Molokans,26 etc. And among them I met many people of high morality who were truly believers. I wanted to be a brother to these people. And what happened? The teaching that had promised me to unite all in a single faith and love, this very teaching in the person of its best representatives told me that these were all people dwelling in falsehood, that what gave them life was a temptation of the devil and that we alone were in possession of the one possible truth. And I saw that the Orthodox consider all those who do not profess a faith identical to theirs to be heretics, exactly as the Catholics and the others consider Orthodoxy to be heresy; I saw that Orthodoxy, although it tries to conceal it, has a hostile attitude to all who do not profess their faith by external symbols and words like Orthodoxy, and that is, as it has to be, firstly because the affirmation that you dwell in falsehood whereas I dwell in truth requires the harshest words that man can say to another, and secondly because a man who loves his children and brothers must have a hostile attitude to those who would turn his children and brothers to a false faith. And this hostility increases with a greater knowledge of Christian teaching. And I, who supposed truth lay in the unity of love, was involuntarily struck by the fact that this very Christian teaching was destroying what it should be producing.","Despite the doubts and sufferings I still clung to the Orthodox Church. But questions of life that had to be resolved kept rising to the surface, and the Church’s ruling on these issues – contrary to the very foundations of faith by which I lived – finally obliged me to renounce the possibility of communion with Orthodoxy. First and foremost these issues concerned the attitude of the Orthodox Church to other Churches, to the Catholics and the so-called Raskolniks.20 At the time, as a result of my interest in religion, I had come into contact with believers of various denominations: Catholics, Protestants, Old Believers,21 Molokans,22 and others. Among them I met many deeply moral men with sincere belief. I wished to be a brother to these people. And what happened? The teaching which had promised me unity of all through one faith and through love, that very teaching, speaking through its highest representatives, told me that all these people were living a lie, that the thing which gave them strength of life was a temptation of the devil, and that it is we alone who are in possession of the only possible truth. And I saw that the Orthodox Church regarded as heretics all those who did not profess an identical faith to theirs, just as the Catholics and the others consider the Orthodox followers to be heretics. And I saw that the Orthodox, although they may try to hide it, regard with hostility all those who do not practise their faith by using the same external symbols and words as themselves. And this could not be otherwise, first of all because the assertion that you live in falsehood and I in truth is the most cruel thing that one man can say to another and secondly, because a man who loves his children and his brothers cannot help feeling hostile towards those who want to convert his children and his brothers to a false belief. And this hostility increases in proportion to one’s knowledge of theology. And assuming that truth lies in union by love, I was struck by the fact that theology was destroying the thing it should be advancing."
"Я не могу даже разобрать – вижу ли я что-нибудь там, внизу, в той бездонной пропасти, над которой я вишу и куда меня тянет. Сердце сжимается, и я испытываю ужас. Смотреть туда ужасно. Если я буду смотреть туда, я чувствую, что я сейчас соскользну с последних помочей и погибну. Я не смотрю, но не смотреть еще хуже, потому что я думаю о том, что будет со мной сейчас, когда я сорвусь с последних помочей. И я чувствую, что от ужаса я теряю последнюю державу и медленно скольжу по спине ниже и ниже. Еще мгновенье, и я оторвусь. И тогда приходит мне мысль: не может это быть правда. Это сон. Проснись. Я пытаюсь проснуться и не могу. Что же делать, что же делать? – спрашиваю я себя и взглядываю вверх. Вверху тоже бездна. Я смотрю в эту бездну неба и стараюсь забыть о бездне внизу, и, действительно, я забываю. Бесконечность внизу отталкивает и ужасает меня; бесконечность вверху притягивает и утверждает меня. Я так же вишу на последних, не выскочивших еще из-под меня помочах над пропастью; я знаю, что вишу, но я смотрю только вверх, и страх мой проходит. Как это бывает во сне, какой-то голос говорит: «Заметь это, это оно!» – и я гляжу все дальше и дальше в бесконечность вверху и чувствую, что я успокаиваюсь, помню все, что было, и вспоминаю, как это все случилось: как я шевелил ногами, как я повис, как я ужаснулся и как спасся от ужаса тем, что стал глядеть вверх. И я спрашиваю себя: ну, а теперь что же, я вишу все так же? И я не столько оглядываюсь, сколько всем телом своим испытываю ту точку опоры, на которой я держусь. И вижу, что я уж не вишу и не падаю, а держусь крепко. Я спрашиваю себя, как я держусь, ощупываюсь, оглядываюсь и вижу, что подо мной, под серединой моего тела, одна помоча, и что, глядя вверх, я лежу на ней в самом устойчивом равновесии, что она одна и держала прежде. И тут, как это бывает во сне, мне представляется тот механизм, посредством которого я держусь, очень естественным, понятным и несомненным, несмотря на то, что наяву этот механизм не имеет никакого смысла. Я во сне даже удивляюсь, как я не понимал этого раньше. Оказывается, что в головах у меня стоит столб, и твердость этого столба не подлежит никакому сомнению, несмотря на то, что стоять этому тонкому столбу не на чем. Потом от столба проведена петля как-то очень хитро и вместе просто, и если лежишь на этой петле серединой тела и смотришь вверх, то даже и вопроса не может быть о падении. Все это мне было ясно, и я был рад и спокоен. И как будто кто-то мне говорит: смотри же, запомни. И я проснулся.","I can't even make out if I see anything down there, in that bottomless abyss over which I hang and where it pulls me. My heart is clenched and I am horrified. It's terrible to look at. If I look there, I feel that I am about to slip off the last restraints and perish. I don't watch, but it's even worse not to watch, because I'm thinking about what will happen to me now that I've broken my last hold. And I feel that from horror I lose the last power and slowly slide down the back lower and lower. Another moment and I'll be gone. And then the thought comes to me: this can't be true. This is a dream. Wake up. I'm trying to wake up and I can't. What to do, what to do? I ask myself and look up. Above, too, the abyss. I look into this abyss of the sky and try to forget about the abyss below, and, indeed, I forget. The infinity below repels and terrifies me; the infinity above attracts and affirms me. I also hang on the last harness that has not yet jumped out from under me over the abyss; I know that I am hanging, but I only look up, and my fear passes. As happens in a dream, a voice says: “Notice this, this is it!” - and I look farther and farther into infinity above and feel that I calm down, I remember everything that happened, and I remember how it all happened: how I moved my legs, how I hung, how I was horrified and how I was saved from the horror by that that began to look up. And I ask myself: well, now what, I hang all the same? And I do not so much look back as I feel with my whole body that fulcrum on which I hold. And I see that I no longer hang and fall, but hold on tight. I ask myself how I am holding on, I feel around, I look around and I see that under me, under the middle of my body, there is one help, and that, looking up, I am lying on it in the most stable balance, which she alone held before. And then, as happens in a dream, the mechanism by which I hold on seems to me very natural, understandable and undoubted, despite the fact that in reality this mechanism does not make any sense. In my sleep, I even wonder how I did not understand this before. It turns out that I have a pillar in my head, and the firmness of this pillar is not subject to any doubt, despite the fact that there is nothing to stand on this thin pillar. Then a loop was drawn from the post somehow very cunningly and simply together, and if you lie on this loop with the middle of your body and look up, then there can’t even be a question about falling. All this was clear to me, and I was glad and calm. And as if someone says to me: look, remember. And I woke up.","I can’t even make out anything there down below, in that bottomless chasm above which I am hanging and into which I am being pulled. My heart contracts and I feel terror. It’s terrifying to look there. If I look there I feel that I’ll at once slip off the last cords and perish. I don’t look, but not to look is even worse because I am thinking of what will happen to me now when I come off the last cords. And I feel that I am losing my last strength from terror and slowly slipping lower and lower on my back. Another minute and I’ll come off. And then a thought comes to me: This cannot be true. This is a dream. Wake up. I try to wake up and I can’t. What am I to do, what am I to do, I ask myself and wake up. Above me too there is infinite space. I look into this infinite space of the heavens and try to forget about the abyss below, and indeed I do forget. The infinite space below repels and terrifies me; the infinite space above attracts and strengthens me. I am still hanging above the chasm on the last cords that haven’t yet slipped out from under me; I know that I am hanging but I only look up and my terror passes. As happens in a dream, a voice is saying, “Watch this, this is it!” and I keep looking more and more deeply into the infinite space above and I feel that I am calmed; I remember everything that has happened and I remember how it all happened: how I moved my legs, how I hung there, how I was terrified, and how I was saved from the terror by starting to look up. And I ask myself, “Well, and what next? I am still hanging.” And I don’t so much look around as feel with my whole body the point of support on which I am being held. And I see that I’m no longer hanging or falling but am being held firmly. I ask myself how I’m being held; I feel, I look, and I see that under me, under the middle of my body, there is a single cord, and that looking up I am lying on it in the most stable equilibrium, and that it alone was holding me before. And here, as happens in dreams, the mechanism by which I am being held appears to me very natural, understandable, and unquestionable although if I’m awake this mechanism makes no sense. In the dream I am even surprised that I didn’t understand it before. It turns out that at the head of my bed there stands a pillar, and the strength of this pillar goes without question although there is nothing for this thin pillar to stand on. Then from this pillar a loop of rope has somehow been let down very cleverly and at the same time very simply, and if you lie on this loop with the middle of your body and look up, then there can’t even be a question of falling. All this was clear to me, and I was glad and calm. And someone seems to be saying to me, “Watch, remember.” And I wake up.","I cannot even discern whether I can see anything there below, in the bottomless abyss over which I am hanging and into which I am being drawn. My heart contracts and I feel terrified. It is dreadful to look down there. I feel that if I look down I will immediately slip from the last support and perish. I do not look, but not looking is still worse because I am thinking about what is going to happen to me when I slip from the last support. And I feel that I am losing my last bit of strength through terror, and that my back is slowly slipping lower and lower. Another moment and I will fall off. And then I have a thought: perhaps it is not real. It is a dream. I will wake up. I try to wake up and cannot. ‘What can I do, what can I do?’ I ask myself, looking upwards. Above there is also an abyss. I look into this abyss of sky and try to forget about the abyss below, and I do in fact forget it. The infinity below repels and frightens me; the infinity above attracts and reassures me. Thus I am hanging over the abyss, held up by the last of the supports that has not yet slipped out from under me; I know that I am dangling but I only look upwards and my fear passes away. As happens in a dream, a voice says: ‘Take note of this, this is it!’ I look further and further into the infinity above me and feel myself growing calmer. I remember everything that has happened and how it happened: how I shifted the position of my legs, how I was dangling there, how terrified I felt, and how I was saved from my terror by looking upwards. And I asked myself: ‘Am I not still dangling there?’ And I do not look around so much as feel with my whole body the edge of the support by which I am held up. I see that I am no longer dangling or falling but am firmly supported. I ask myself how I am being supported: I grope about, look around and see that beneath me, under the middle of my body, there is a single support and when I look up I am lying on it in a position of secure balance, and that it alone gave me support before. And then, as happens in dreams, the mechanism by which I am supported seems to me to be a very natural, comprehensible and sure thing, although when awake it makes no sense at all. I am even surprised, in my sleep, that I had not understood this before. It appears that there is a pillar at my head and the solidity of this slender pillar is beyond doubt, although there is nothing for it to stand on. A rope is hanging very ingeniously, yet simply, from the pillar, and if one lies with the middle of one’s body on the rope and looks up there can be no question of falling. This was all clear to me and I was glad and tranquil. It was as if someone were saying to me: ‘See that you remember.’ And I woke up."
"Мы все тогда были убеждены, что нам нужно говорить и говорить, писать, печатать – как можно скорее, как можно больше, что все это нужно для блага человечества.

И, не замечая того, что мы ничего не знаем, что на самый простой вопрос жизни: что хорошо, что дурно, – мы не знаем, что ответить, мы все, не слушая друг друга, все враз говорили, иногда потакая друг другу и восхваляя друг друга с тем, чтоб и мне потакали и меня похвалили, иногда же раздражаясь и перекрикивая друг друга, точно так, как в сумасшедшем доме.","We were all then convinced that we needed to speak and speak, write, print - as soon as possible, as much as possible, that all this was necessary for the good of mankind.

People belonging to this category know that death is preferable to life but, lacking the strength to act rationally and bring a quick end to the deception by killing themselves, they seem to wait for something. This is the escape of weakness, for if I know of something better and it is within my reach, then why not yield to it? I myself belonged to this category."
"Я говорил о том, что для всякого неверующего, обращающегося к вере (а подлежит этому обращению все наше молодое поколение), этот вопрос представляется первым: почему истина не в лютеранстве, не в католицизме, а в православии? Его учат в гимназии, и ему нельзя не знать, как этого не знает мужик, что протестант, католик так же точно утверждают единую истинность своей веры. Исторические доказательства, подгибаемые каждым исповеданием в свою сторону, недостаточны. Нельзя ли, – говорил я, – выше понимать учение, так, чтобы с высоты учения исчезали бы различия, как они исчезают для истинно верующего? Нельзя ли идти дальше по тому пути, по которому мы идем с старообрядцами? Они утверждали, что крест, аллилуйя и хождение вокруг алтаря у нас другие. Мы сказали: вы верите в Никейский символ, в семь таинств, и мы верим. Давайте же держаться этого, а в остальном делайте, как хотите. Мы соединились с ними тем, что поставили существенное в вере выше несущественного. Теперь с католиками нельзя ли сказать: вы верите в то-то и то-то, в главное, а по отношению к filioque и папе делайте, как хотите. Нельзя ли того же сказать и протестантам, соединившись с ними на главном? Собеседник мой согласился с моей мыслью, но сказал мне, что такие уступки произведут нарекания на духовную власть в том, что она отступает от веры предков, и произведут раскол, а призвание духовной власти – блюсти во всей чистоте греко-российскую православную веру, переданную ей от предков.","I said that for every unbeliever who turns to faith (and our entire young generation is subject to this conversion), this question is the first: why is the truth not in Lutheranism, not in Catholicism, but in Orthodoxy? He is taught in the gymnasium, and it is impossible for him not to know, as the peasant does not know, that a Protestant, a Catholic, just as accurately affirms the one truth of his faith. The historical evidence, which each confession bends in its own direction, is insufficient. Is it not possible, I said, to understand the teaching higher, so that differences would disappear from the height of the teaching, as they disappear for the true believer? Is it not possible to go further along the path we are following with the Old Believers? They argued that the cross, hallelujah and walking around the altar are different for us. We said: you believe in the Nicene symbol, in the seven sacraments, and we believe. Let's stick to this, but otherwise do as you like. We united with them by placing the essential in faith above the inessential. Now, with Catholics, is it impossible to say: you believe in such and such, in the main thing, but in relation to the filioque and the pope, do as you like. Is it not possible to say the same to the Protestants, uniting with them on the main thing? My interlocutor agreed with my thought, but told me that such concessions would lead to criticism of the spiritual authorities in that they deviate from the faith of their ancestors, and would produce a split, and the calling of the spiritual authorities would be to observe in all purity the Greek-Russian Orthodox faith transmitted to it. from ancestors.","I said that for every unbeliever who turns to the faith (and all our young generation is liable to do this) the question that puts itself first is: Why is truth held not by Lutheranism, not by Catholicism, but by Orthodoxy? He has been taught in the gymnasium and he cannot help but know what the peasant doesn’t know, that Protestants and Catholics just as firmly affirm the sole truth of their faith. Historical evidence, twisted by every denomination to its own interest, is not enough. Might one not, I said, understand the teaching at a higher plane so that at that plane all differences in the teaching disappear, as they disappear for the true believer? Can we not go further along the path we are taking with the Old Believers? They affirmed that they have a different cross and hallelujahs and way of processing around the altar. We said: “You believe in the Nicene Creed and the seven sacraments, and we believe in them. Let us abide by that but for the rest do what you want.” We have united with them by putting the essentials in faith above the inessentials. Now with the Catholics, can’t we say: “You believe in this and that, the most important things, but as for the filioque29 and the pope do what you want?” Cannot we say the same to the Protestants, being united with them on the main points? The priest I was talking to agreed with my way of thinking but said to me that such concessions would bring about censure on the religious authorities for renouncing the faith of our ancestors and would bring about a schism, and the mission of the religious authorities is to guard in all its purity the Greco-Russian Orthodox faith that has been handed down by our ancestors.","I have already said that for every non-believer who returns to the faith (and this could include all of our younger generation), the question that first presents itself is: why is the truth not to be found in Lutheranism, or Catholicism, but only in the Orthodox faith? Someone who has been educated at secondary school cannot help knowing what the peasant does not know – namely, that the Protestants and Catholics are equally convinced of the singular truth of their faiths. Historical evidence, twisted by each religion to suit its own purpose, is insufficient. Is it not possible, as I have suggested, to understand the teachings in a superior way, so that from an elevated level the differences might disappear, as they do for people who genuinely believe? Is it not possible to go further along that path which we are following with the Old Believers? They stress the fact that their cross, their allelujahs, and their way of processing around the altar differ from ours. We say: you believe in the Nicene Creed and in the seven sacraments, and so do we. Let us keep to that and for the rest you may do as you please. Thus we have united with them by placing the essential aspects of faith above the non-essential. Is it not possible to say to the Catholics: you believe in such and such and so and so, which are the important things, as for the issue of the filoque24 and the Pope, you may do as you please. And can we not say the same to the Protestants and unite with them in the more important issues? My interlocutor agreed with my ideas, but told me that such concessions would provoke criticism from the spiritual authorities in that it suggests a departure from the faith of our ancestors and would lead to a schism, and that the vocation of the clergy is to safeguard, in all its purity, the Greek Orthodox faith that has been handed down by our forefathers."
"Этого второго вывода придерживается большинство людей нашего круга. Условия, в которых они находятся, делают то, что благ у них больше, чем зол, а нравственная тупость дает им возможность забывать, что выгода их положения случайна, что всем нельзя иметь 1000 женщин и дворцов, как Соломон, что на каждого человека с 1000 жен есть 1000 людей без жен, и на каждый дворец есть 1000 людей, в поте лица строящих его, и что та случайность, которая нынче сделала меня Соломоном, завтра может сделать меня рабом Соломона. Тупость же воображения этих людей дает им возможность забывать про то, что не дало покоя Будде, – неизбежность болезни, старости и смерти, которая не нынче – завтра разрушит все эти удовольствия. То, что некоторые из этих людей утверждают, что тупость их мысли и воображения есть философия, которую они называют позитивной, не выделяет их, на мой взгляд, из разряда тех, которые, не видя вопроса, лижут мед. И этим людям я не мог подражать: не имея их тупости воображения, я не мог ее искусственно произвести в себе. Я не мог, как не может всякий живой человек, оторвать глаз от мышей и дракона, когда он раз увидал их.","This second conclusion is held by the majority of people in our circle. The conditions in which they find themselves make it that they have more good than evil, and moral stupidity makes it possible for them to forget that the advantage of their position is accidental, that everyone cannot have 1000 women and palaces, like Solomon, that for every person with 1000 wives are 1000 people without wives, and for every palace there are 1000 people who build it by the sweat of their brows, and that the accident that today made me Solomon may tomorrow make me Solomon's slave. The dullness of the imagination of these people gives them the opportunity to forget about what haunted the Buddha - the inevitability of illness, old age and death, which not today - tomorrow will destroy all these pleasures. The fact that some of these people claim that the dullness of their thought and imagination is the philosophy that they call positive does not, in my opinion, distinguish them from the category of those who, not seeing the question, lick honey. And I could not imitate these people: not having their stupidity of imagination, I could not artificially produce it in myself. I could not, just as no living person can, take my eyes off the mice and the dragon when he once saw them.","Most people in our world take this way out. The conditions in which they find themselves mean that they have more good things than bad, and moral obtuseness makes it possible for them to forget that not everyone can have a thousand women and palaces like Solomon, that for every man with a thousand wives there are a thousand men without wives, and that for every palace there are a thousand men building it with the sweat of their brows, and that the chance which today has made me Solomon tomorrow can make me Solomon’s slave. The obtuseness of these people’s imagination makes it possible for them to forget what gave Buddha no comfort—the inevitability of illness, old age, and death that any day now will destroy all these pleasures. The fact that some of these people affirm that the obtuseness of their thought and imagination is a philosophy that they call positive does not in my view set them apart from the ranks of those who lick the honey without seeing the question. And I could not copy these people; lacking their obtuseness of imagination I could not artificially produce it in me. I could not take my eyes from the mice and the dragon, like any living man once he has seen them.","This second method of escape sustains the majority of people of our circle. The conditions in which they find themselves dictate that they have a greater share of the good things in life than the bad; their moral torpor allows them to forget that all the privileges of their position are accidental and that not everyone can have a thousand wives and palaces as Solomon did; that for every man with a thousand wives there are a thousand men without wives, and that for every palace there are a thousand men who built it by the sweat of their brow, and that the same chance that has made you Solomon today might make you Solomon’s slave tomorrow. The inertia of these people’s imagination enables them to forget why it was Buddha was granted no peace: the inevitability of illness, old age and death, which can, if not today then tomorrow, destroy all these pleasures. The fact that a number of these people affirm that the dullness of their thought and imagination is something called ‘positive philosophy’fails, in my opinion, to make them any different from the ranks of those who, failing to see the question, lick the honey. I could not imitate these people, for not sharing their dullness of imagination I could not create it artificially in myself. Like any man who sincerely lives I could not turn my eyes away from the mice and the dragon once I had seen them."

"«Суета сует, – говорит Соломон, – суета сует – все суета! Что пользы человеку от всех трудов его, которыми трудится он под солнцем? Род преходит и род приходит, а земля пребывает вовеки. Что было, то и будет; и что делалось, то и будет делаться; и нет ничего нового под солнцем. Бывает нечто, о чем говорят: „смотри, вот это новое“; но это было уже в веках, бывших прежде нас. Нет памяти о прежнем; да и о том, что будет, не останется памяти у тех, которые будут после. Я, Екклезиаст, был царем над Израилем в Иерусалиме. И предал я сердце мое тому, чтоб исследовать и испытать мудростию все, что делается под небом: это тяжелое занятие дал бог сынам человеческим, чтоб они упражнялись в нем. Видел я все дела, какие делаются под солнцем, и вот, все суета и томление духа… Говорил я в сердце моем так: вот я возвеличился, приобрел мудрости больше всех, которые были прежде меня над Иерусалимом, и сердце мое видело много мудрости и знания. И предал я сердце мое тому, чтобы познать мудрость и познать безумие и глупость; узнал, что и это – томление духа. Потому что во многой мудрости много печали; и кто умножает познания – умножает скорбь.","“Vanity of vanities,” says Solomon, “vanity of vanities—all is vanity! What is the use of a man from all his labors with which he toils under the sun? A generation passes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever. What was, is what will be; and what has been done is what will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun. There is something about which they say: “look, this is new”; but that was already in the ages that were before us. There is no memory of the former; and of what will be, there will be no memory for those who will come after. I, the Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. And I gave my heart to explore and test with wisdom everything that is done under heaven: this hard work God gave to the sons of men, so that they would exercise in it. I saw all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of the spirit ... I spoke in my heart like this: behold, I have been exalted, I have acquired wisdom more than all that were before me over Jerusalem, and my heart saw much wisdom and knowledge . And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know foolishness and foolishness; I learned that this, too, is vexation of the spirit.

"Ведь этот вопрос был поставлен с тех пор, как люди есть; и с тех пор, как люди есть, понято, что для решения этого вопроса одинаково недостаточно приравнивать конечное к конечному и бесконечное к бесконечному, и с тех пор, как люди есть, отысканы отношения конечного к бесконечному и выражены.","For this question has been posed ever since people have existed; and since there have been people, it has been understood that to solve this question it is equally insufficient to equate the finite with the finite and the infinite with the infinite, and since there have been people, the relations of the finite with the infinite have been found and expressed.","This question has been asked ever since man has existed; and ever since man has existed, it has been understood that for the question to be answered it has been just as inadequate to equate finite to finite and infinite to infinite, and ever since man has existed, the relationship of finite to infinite has been looked for and expressed.",Surely this question has been raised ever since man has existed. Since the beginning it has been evident that solving the question by equating the finite with the finite is just as unsatisfactory as equating the infinite with the infinite.

"По объяснению этих богословов основной догмат веры есть непогрешимая церковь. Из признания этого догмата вытекает, как необходимое последствие, истинность всего исповедуемого церковью. Церковь, как собрание верующих, соединенных любовью и потому имеющих истинное знание, сделалась основой моей веры. Я говорил себе, что божеская истина не может быть доступна одному человеку, она открывается только всей совокупности людей, соединенных любовью. Для того чтобы постигнуть истину, надо не разделяться; а для того чтобы не разделяться, надо любить и примиряться с тем, с чем не согласен. Истина откроется любви, и потому, если ты не подчиняешься обрядам церкви, ты нарушаешь любовь; а нарушая любовь, ты лишаешься возможности познать истину. Я не видал тогда софизма, находящегося в этом рассуждении. Я не видал тогда того, что единение в любви может дать величайшую любовь, но никак не богословскую истину, выраженную определенными словами в Никейском символе, не видал и того, что любовь никак не может сделать известное выражение истины обязательным для единения. Я не видал тогда ошибки этого рассуждения и благодаря ему получил возможность принять и исполнять все обряды православной церкви, не понимая большую часть их. Я старался тогда всеми силами души избегать всяких рассуждений, противоречий и пытался объяснить, сколько возможно разумно, те положения церковные, с которыми я сталкивался.","According to the explanation of these theologians, the fundamental dogma of faith is the infallible church. From the recognition of this dogma follows, as a necessary consequence, the truth of everything professed by the Church. The Church, as a gathering of believers united by love and therefore having true knowledge, has become the foundation of my faith. I told myself that divine truth cannot be accessible to one person, it is revealed only to the whole set of people united by love. In order to comprehend the truth, one must not be divided; and in order not to be divided, one must love and reconcile with what one does not agree with. Truth will be revealed to love, and therefore, if you do not obey the rites of the church, you violate love; and by violating love, you deprive yourself of the opportunity to know the truth. I did not then see the sophistry contained in this reasoning. I did not then see that unity in love can give the greatest love, but I did not see the theological truth expressed in certain words in the Nicene Creed, nor did I see that love can in no way make a certain expression of truth obligatory for unity. At that time I did not see the error of this reasoning, and thanks to it I was able to accept and perform all the rites of the Orthodox Church, without understanding most of them. At that time I tried with all the strength of my soul to avoid any arguments, contradictions, and tried to explain, as rationally as possible, those church positions that I came across.","According to the explanation of these theologians the fundamental dogma of faith is the infallible church. From the acceptance of this dogma there comes as a necessary consequence the truth of all that the church professes. The church, as an assembly of believers united by love and therefore having true knowledge, became the foundation of my faith. I said to myself that God’s truth cannot be available just to one man; it discloses itself only to the whole totality of people united by love. To comprehend the truth one must not stand apart, and in order not to stand apart one must love and accept what one may not agree with. Truth discloses itself to love and so if you don’t submit to the rituals of the church, you destroy love; and in destroying love you deprive yourself of the possibility of knowing the truth. I didn’t see then the sophistry expressed in this argument. I didn’t see then that being united in love can give very great love but surely not the divine truth expressed in the precise words of the Nicene Creed; I did not see that love cannot make a particular expression of the truth an essential condition of unity. I did not see then the error of this argument, and thanks to it I found it possible to accept and perform all the rituals of the Orthodox Church without understanding most of them. I tried then with all the powers of my spirit to avoid any arguments and contradictions, and tried to explain rationally insofar as it was possible the church’s propositions with which I came into conflict.","According to the explanations of these theologians, the basic dogma of faith is the infallibility of the Church. The truth of everything the Church professes follows from this dogma as a necessary conclusion.

I told myself that religious truth cannot be attained by one man alone, but only reveals itself to a union of all people, united through love. In order for the truth to be attained there must be no separation; and for there to be no separation we must love and make peace with those who are not in agreement with us. Truth manifests itself as love, and therefore if you do not respect the rituals of the Church you destroy love. And in destroying love you deprive yourself of the possibility of knowing the truth. At the time I did not see the sophistry of this argument. I did not see that unity in love can reveal the greatest love but never the divine truth as expressed in the definitive words of the Nicene Creed. I failed to see that love can never make a given expression of the truth a compulsory condition of unity. At the time I did not see the flaws in the argument, and thanks to it I was able to accept and fulfil all the rites of the Orthodox Church without understanding the majority of them. At the time I tried with my whole soul to avoid any arguments or contradictions, and attempted to explain those doctrines of the Church with which I was in conflict as reasonably as possible."
"Что, если бы палач, проводящий жизнь в пытках и отсечении голов, или мертвый пьяница, или сумасшедший, засевший на всю жизнь в темную комнату, огадивший эту свою комнату и воображающий, что он погибнет, если выйдет из нее, – что, если б они спросили себя: что такое жизнь? Очевидно, они не могли бы получить на вопрос: что такое жизнь, – другого ответа, как тот, что жизнь есть величайшее зло; и ответ сумасшедшего был бы совершенно правилен, но для него только.

"В это же время со мною случилось следующее. Во все продолжение этого года, когда я почти всякую минуту спрашивал себя: не кончить ли петлей или пулей, – во все это время, рядом с теми ходами мыслей и наблюдений, о которых я говорил, сердце мое томилось мучительным чувством. Чувство это я не могу назвать иначе, как исканием бога.","At the same time, the following happened to me. Throughout this year, when I was asking myself almost every minute whether I should end up with a noose or a bullet, all this time, next to those trains of thoughts and observations of which I spoke, my heart languished with a painful feeling. I cannot call this feeling otherwise than the search for God.","At that time the following happened to me.

"Сообщенное мне с детства вероучение исчезло во мне так же, как и в других, с той только разницей, что так как я очень рано стал много читать и думать, то мое отречение от вероучения очень рано стало сознательным. Я с шестнадцати лет перестал становиться на молитву и перестал по собственному побуждению ходить в церковь и говеть. Я перестал верить в то, что мне было сообщено с детства, но я верил во что-то. Во что я верил, я никак бы не мог сказать. Верил я и в бога, или, скорее, я не отрицал бога, но какого бога, я бы не мог сказать; не отрицал я и Христа и его учение, но в чем было его учение, я тоже не мог бы сказать.","The doctrine communicated to me from childhood disappeared in me just as it did in others, with the only difference being that since I began to read and think a lot very early, my renunciation of the doctrine became conscious very early.

I stopped believing in what I was told from childhood, but I believed in something. What I believed in, I could never say.

"Я, естественно, обратился прежде всего к верующим людям моего круга, к людям ученым, к православным богословам, к монахам-старцам, к православным богословам нового оттенка и даже к так называемым новым христианам, исповедующим спасение верою в искупление.

"Положение мое было ужасно. Я знал, что я ничего не найду на пути разумного знания, кроме отрицания жизни, а там в вере – ничего, кроме отрицания разума, которое еще невозможнее, чем отрицание жизни.

"Но как в области опытных знаний человек, искренно спрашивающий, как мне жить, не может удовлетвориться ответом: изучи в бесконечном пространстве бесконечные по времени сложности изменения бесконечных частиц, и тогда ты поймешь свою жизнь, точно так же не может искренний человек удовлетвориться ответом: изучи жизнь всего человечества, которого ни начала, ни конца мы не можем знать и малой части которого мы не знаем, и тогда ты поймешь свою жизнь. И точно так же, как в полунауках опытных, и эти полунауки тем более исполнены неясностей, неточностей, глупостей и противоречий, чем далее они уклоняются от своих задач. Задача опытной науки есть причинная последовательность материальных явлений. Стоит опытной науке ввести вопрос о конечной причине, и получается чепуха. Задача умозрительной науки есть сознание беспричинной сущности жизни. Стоит ввести исследование причинных явлений, как явления социальные, исторических, и получается чепуха.","But just as in the field of experimental knowledge, a person who sincerely asks how I should live cannot be satisfied with the answer: study in infinite space the time-infinite complexities of changing infinite particles, and then you will understand your life, in the same way a sincere person cannot be satisfied with the answer: study the life of all mankind, of which we cannot know either the beginning or the end, and a small part of which we do not know, and then you will understand your life. And just as in the experimental semi-sciences, these semi-sciences are all the more full of obscurities, inaccuracies, stupidities and contradictions, the further they deviate from their tasks. The task of experimental science is the causal succession of material phenomena. It is enough for experimental science to introduce the question of the final cause, and the result is nonsense. The task of speculative science is the consciousness of the causeless essence of life. It is enough to introduce the study of causal phenomena, as social, historical phenomena, and the result is nonsense.","But just as in the sphere of the experimental sciences a man sincerely asking, “How should I live?” cannot be satisfied with the answer, “Study the infinite changes of infinite particles in infinite space, changes infinite in time and in complexity, and then you will understand your life,” so a sincere man cannot be satisfied by the answer, “Study the life of all mankind of which we know neither beginning nor end, and of which we don’t know even a small part, and then you will understand your life.” And in just the same way as in the experimental semi-sciences, these semi-sciences too fill up with obscurities, imprecisions, stupidities, and contradictions the further they deviate from their subjects. The subject of experimental science is the causal sequence of material phenomena. Experimental science has only to introduce the question of a final cause and the result is nonsense. The subject of speculative science is awareness of the essence of life that has no cause. Introduce the study of causal phenomena—like social and historical phenomena—and the result is nonsense.","But just as in the realms of experimental sciences a person who sincerely asks how he ought to live cannot be satisfied with an answer advising him to study the infinite complexities and mutations of an infinite number of particles in the infinity of space and time; similarly a person who sincerely asks how he ought to live cannot be satisfied with an answer telling him that in order to understand himself he must first study the life of the whole of humanity, of which neither the beginning nor the end is known, nor even the smallest part. And, as with the experimental semi-sciences, the more these other sciences diverge from their purpose, the more they become filled with vagueness, lack of precision, stupidities and contradictions. The problem concerning experimental science is the sequence of cause and effect in material phenomena. Experimental science only has to be introduced to the question of final causes for it to turn into a nonsense. The problem facing speculative science is acknowledgement of the essence of life that lies beyond cause and effect. And one only has to introduce causative phenomena, such as social or historical data, into the investigations and it turns into a nonsense."
"«Искусство, поэзия?..» Долго под влиянием успеха похвалы людской я уверял себя, что это – дело, которое можно делать, несмотря на то, что придет смерть, которая уничтожит все – и меня, и мои дела, и память о них; но скоро я увидал, что и это – обман. Мне было ясно, что искусство есть украшение жизни, заманка к жизни. Но жизнь потеряла для меня свою заманчивость, как же я могу заманивать других? Пока я не жил своею жизнью, а чужая жизнь несла меня на своих волнах, пока я верил, что жизнь имеет смысл, хоть я и не умею выразить его, – отражения жизни всякого рода в поэзии и искусствах доставляли мне радость, мне весело было смотреть на жизнь в это зеркальце искусства; но когда я стал отыскивать смысл жизни, когда я почувствовал необходимость самому жить, – зеркальце это стало мне или ненужно, излишне и смешно, или мучительно. Мне нельзя уже было утешаться тем, что я в зеркальце вижу, что положение мое глупо и отчаянно. Хорошо мне было радоваться этому, когда в глубине души я верил, что жизнь моя имеет смысл. Тогда эта игра светов и теней – комического, трагического, трогательного, прекрасного, ужасного в жизни – потешала меня. Но когда я знал, что жизнь бессмысленна и ужасна, – игра в зеркальце не могла уже забавлять меня. Никакая сладость меда не могла быть сладка мне, когда я видел дракона и мышей, подтачивающих мою опору.","""Art, poetry?.."" For a long time, under the influence of the success of people's praise, I assured myself that this is a thing that can be done, despite the fact that death will come, which will destroy everything - and me, and my deeds, and the memory of them ; but I soon saw that this, too, was a deceit. It was clear to me that art is an adornment of life, a lure to life. But life has lost its temptation for me, how can I lure others? While I did not live my own life, and someone else's life carried me on its own waves, while I believed that life had meaning, although I did not know how to express it, reflections of life of all kinds in poetry and art gave me joy, it was fun for me to look to life in this mirror of art; but when I began to search for the meaning of life, when I felt the need to live myself, this mirror became either unnecessary, superfluous and ridiculous, or painful. I could no longer console myself with the fact that I saw in the mirror that my situation was stupid and desperate. It was good for me to rejoice at this, when in the depths of my soul I believed that my life had meaning. Then this play of lights and shadows - comic, tragic, touching, beautiful, terrible in life - amused me. But when I knew that life was meaningless and terrible, the game in the mirror could no longer amuse me. No sweetness of honey could be sweet to me when I saw the dragon and the mice undermining my footing.","Art, poetry? For a long time, influenced by the success of popular adulation, I convinced myself that this was work I could do, in spite of the fact that death would come, which would destroy everything—me and my works and the memory of them; but I soon saw that they too were an illusion. It was clear to me that art was a decoration of life, an enticement to life. But life has lost its enticement for me; how can I entice others? While I was living a life that was not my own but an alien life was bearing me along on its waves, while I believed that life had a meaning although I couldn’t express it, all kinds of reflections of life, in poetry and art, gave me joy; I was happy looking at life in art’s little mirror, but when I began to look for the meaning of life, when I felt the necessity of living myself, that little mirror became for me unnecessary, superfluous, and ridiculous, or painful. I could no longer comfort myself with the fact that I saw in the mirror that my situation was stupid and desperate. It was all very well for me to enjoy that when I believed in the depth of my soul that my life has a meaning. Then the play of light and shade—of the comic, tragic, moving, beautiful, terrible in life—entertained me. But when I knew that life is meaningless and terrible, the game in the mirror could no longer amuse me. No sweetness of honey could be sweet for me when I saw the dragon and the mice gnawing away at my support.","And the truth is death. ‘Art, poetry…’ For a long time, under the influence of success and praise from others, I had persuaded myself that this was a thing that could be done, despite the fact of approaching death which obliterates everything: myself, my works and the memory of both. But I quickly realized that this too was a delusion. It was clear to me that art is an adornment and embellishment of life. But it had lost its charm for me, so how could I charm others? While I was not living my own life but was being carried along on the crest of another life, as long as I believed that life had meaning even if I could not express it, the reflection of life in poetry and in art of all kinds gave me joy and I enjoyed watching life through the mirror of art. But when I began to search for the meaning of life, when I began to feel the necessity of living, I found this mirror either unnecessary, superfluous and ridiculous, or tormenting. I could no longer be comforted by what I saw in the mirror, namely my stupid and desperate position. It was all right for me to rejoice in the sight while in the depths of my soul I believed that my life had meaning. Then the play of light and shade, the comic, the tragic, the touching, the beautiful, and the frightening aspects of life comforted me. But when I saw that life is meaningless and terrible, the play in the mirror could no longer amuse me. However sweet the honey, it could not be sweet to me while I saw the dragon and the mice gnawing at my support."
"Вот это было ужасно. И чтоб избавиться от этого ужаса, я хотел убить себя.

"Так люди моего разбора четырьмя путями спасаются от ужасного противоречия. Сколько я ни напрягал своего умственного внимания, кроме этих четырех выходов, я не видал еще иного. Один выход: не понимать того, что жизнь есть бессмыслица, суета и зло и что лучше не жить. Я не мог не знать этого и, когда раз узнал, не мог закрыть на это глаза. Другой выход – пользоваться жизнью такою, какая есть, не думая о будущем. И этого не мог сделать. Я, как Сакиа-Муни, не мог ехать на охоту, когда знал, что есть старость, страдания, смерть. Воображение у меня было слишком живо. Кроме того, я не мог радоваться минутной случайности, кинувшей на мгновение наслаждение на мою долю. Третий выход: поняв, что жизнь есть зло и глупость, прекратить, убить себя. Я понял это, но почему-то все еще не убивал себя. Четвертый выход – жить в положении Соломона, Шопенгауэра – знать, что жизнь есть глупая, сыгранная надо мною шутка, и все-таки жить, умываться, одеваться, обедать, говорить и даже книжки писать. Это было для меня отвратительно, мучительно, но я оставался в этом положении.","Thus the people of my analysis are saved in four ways from a terrible contradiction. No matter how much I strained my mental attention, besides these four exits, I did not see anything else. One way out: not to understand that life is nonsense, vanity and evil, and that it is better not to live. I could not help but know this, and when I once found out, I could not close my eyes to it. Another way out is to enjoy life as it is, without thinking about the future. And he couldn't do it. I, like Sakia-Muni, could not go hunting when I knew that there is old age, suffering, death. My imagination was too vivid. Besides, I could not rejoice at the momentary chance that threw pleasure for a moment into my lot. The third way out: realizing that life is evil and stupidity, stop, kill yourself. I figured it out, but somehow still didn't kill myself. The fourth way out is to live in the position of Solomon, Schopenhauer - to know that life is a stupid joke played on me, and still live, wash, dress, dine, talk and even write books. It was disgusting, painful for me, but I remained in this position.","So people like me are saved from a terrible dilemma by four ways out. However much I strained my mental concentration, I could not see any other way out apart from these four. The first way: not to understand that life is meaningless, vanity, and evil and that it’s better not to live. I couldn’t help knowing that, and once I knew it I couldn’t shut my eyes to it. The second way: to make use of life as it is, not thinking of the future. That too I couldn’t do. Like Shakyamuni I couldn’t go hunting when I knew that there existed old age, suffering, death. My imagination was too lively. Furthermore I couldn’t rejoice in the fleeting chance that for a moment threw pleasure to my lot. The third way: having understood that life is evil and folly, to put an end to it, to kill oneself. That I understood, but for some reason I didn’t kill myself yet. The fourth way: to live taking the position of Solomon and Schopenhauer; to know that life is a foolish joke played on us and still to live, wash, dress, dine, talk, and even write little books. For me that was repugnant, painful, but that was the position I took.","Thus, people of my kind have four ways of saving themselves from a terrible contradiction. However hard I strained my mental faculties I could find no other than these four modes of escape. In the first method there is a failure to understand that life is meaningless, vain and evil and that it is better not to live. I could not help knowing this, and once I had realized it I could not close my eyes to it. The second method is to make use of life, such as it is, without thinking about the future. Neither could I do this. Like Saki-Muni, I could not ride out hunting when I knew that suffering, old age and death exist. My imagination was too fertile. Moreover I could not take pleasure in those fleeting occasions which momentarily threw pleasure on my existence. The third method is to have realized that life is evil and absurd and to bring it to an end by killing oneself. The fourth method of escape is to live like Solomon and Schopenhauer, knowing that life is a stupid joke being played on us, but nevertheless continuing to live, to wash, to dress, to eat, to talk, and even to write books. Although I found if offensive and painful I remained in this position."

"Один ряд знаний как бы и не признает вопроса, но зато ясно и точно отвечает на свои независимо поставленные вопросы: это – ряд знаний опытных, и на крайней точке их стоит математика; другой ряд знаний признает вопрос, но не отвечает на него: это – ряд знаний умозрительных, и на крайней их точке – метафизика.","One series of knowledge, as it were, does not recognize the question, but on the other hand it clearly and accurately answers its independently posed questions: this is a series of experimental knowledge, and mathematics stands at its extreme point; another series of knowledge recognizes the question, but does not answer it: this is a series of speculative knowledge, and at their extreme point is metaphysics.","One range of sciences seems not to recognize the question, though it clearly and precisely answers its own independently put questions: that is the range of experimental sciences, with mathematics at their extreme point.

"Но опять и опять с разных других сторон я приходил к тому же признанию того, что не мог же я без всякого повода, причины и смысла явиться на свет, что не могу я быть таким выпавшим из гнезда птенцом, каким я себя чувствовал. Пускай я, выпавший птенец, лежу на спине, пищу в высокой траве, но я пищу оттого, что знаю, что меня в себе выносила мать, высиживала, грела, кормила, любила. Где она, эта мать?

"То же я испытывал при праздновании главных праздников. Помнить день субботний, т. е. посвятить один день на обращение к богу, мне было понятно. Но главный праздник был воспоминание о событии воскресения, действительность которого я не мог себе представить и понять. И этим именем воскресенья назывался еженедельно празднуемый день. И в эти дни совершалось таинство евхаристии, которое было мне совершенно непонятно. Остальные все двенадцать праздников, кроме Рождества, были воспоминания о чудесах, о том, о чем я старался не думать, чтобы не отрицать: Вознесенье, Пятидесятница, Богоявленье, Покров и т. д. При праздновании этих праздников, чувствуя, что приписывается важность тому самому, что для меня составляет самую обратную важность, я или придумывал успокоивавшие меня объяснения, или закрывал глаза, чтобы не видать того, что соблазняет меня.","I experienced the same when celebrating major holidays. It was clear to me to remember the Sabbath day, that is, to dedicate one day to turning to God. But the main holiday was a remembrance of the event of the resurrection, the reality of which I could not imagine and understand. And this Sunday was the name of the weekly celebrated day. And in these days the sacrament of the Eucharist was celebrated, which was completely incomprehensible to me. The rest of all twelve holidays, except for Christmas, were memories of miracles, about what I tried not to think about so as not to deny: Ascension, Pentecost, Epiphany, Intercession, etc. When celebrating these holidays, feeling that importance is attributed to I myself, which for me is of the opposite importance, either invented explanations that calmed me, or closed my eyes so as not to see what tempted me.","I felt the same in celebrating the major church feasts. To remember the Sabbath, that is, to devote a day to turning to God, I found understandable.

The other twelve feast days apart from Christmas commemorated miracles, something I was trying not to think about so as not to deny them—the Ascension, Pentecost, the Epiphany, the feast of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin, etc. In celebrating these feasts, feeling that importance was being given to what was for me the opposite of important, I either invented palliative explanations or I shut my eyes so as not to see what was tempting me.","I experienced the same thing over the celebration of the major feasts.

All the other twelve feast days, except for Christmas, were in memory of miracles – things which I endeavoured not to think about, in order not to deny them: the Ascension, Pentecost, the Epiphany, the Intercession of the Virgin, and so on.

"Не то, что в изложении своего вероучения они примешивали к всегда бывшим мне близкими христианским истинам еще много ненужных и неразумных вещей, – не это оттолкнуло меня; но меня оттолкнуло то, что жизнь этих людей была та же, как и моя, с тою только разницей, что она не соответствовала тем самым началам, которые они излагали в своем вероучении. Я ясно чувствовал, что они обманывают себя и что у них, так же как у меня, нет другого смысла жизни, как того, чтобы жить, пока живется, и брать все, что может взять рука. Я видел это по тому, что если б у них был тот смысл, при котором уничтожается страх лишений, страданий и смерти, то они бы не боялись их. А они, эти верующие нашего круга, точно так же, как и я, жили в избытке, старались увеличить или сохранить его, боялись лишений, страданий, смерти, и так же, как я и все мы, неверующие, жили, удовлетворяя похотям, жили так же дурно, если не хуже, чем неверующие.","It was not that, in the exposition of their doctrine, they mixed many more unnecessary and unreasonable things with the Christian truths that were always close to me - it was not this that repelled me; but I was repulsed by the fact that the life of these people was the same as mine, with the only difference that it did not correspond to the very principles that they expounded in their dogma. I clearly felt that they were deceiving themselves and that they, like me, have no other meaning in life than to live while they live, and to take everything that a hand can take.

"Сакиа-Муни, молодой счастливый царевич, от которого скрыты были болезни, старость, смерть, едет на гулянье и видит страшного старика, беззубого и слюнявого.

Ему говорят, что сделаться мертвым значит сделаться тем, чем сделался этот человек. Царевич подходит к мертвому, открывает и смотрит на него. «Что же будет с ним дальше?» – спрашивает царевич. Ему говорят, что его закопают в землю. «Зачем?» – Затем, что он уже наверно не будет больше никогда живой, а только будет от него смрад и черви. – «И это удел всех людей? И со мною то же будет?

He was told that to be dead was to be what this man was. The Prince went up to the dead body, uncovered it and looked at it. ‘What will become of him now?’ he asked. The Prince was told that the man would be buried in the ground. ‘Why?’ ‘Because he will never live again and all that will come of him is stench and worms.’ ‘And is this the fate of all men?

"Отпадение мое от веры произошло во мне так же, как оно происходило и происходит теперь в людях нашего склада образования. Оно, как мне кажется, происходит в большинстве случаев так: люди живут так, как все живут, а живут все на основании начал, не только не имеющих ничего общего с вероучением, но большею частью противоположных ему; вероучение не участвует в жизни, и в сношениях с другими людьми никогда не приходится сталкиваться, и в собственной жизни самому никогда не приходится справляться с ним; вероучение это исповедуется где-то там, вдали от жизни и независимо от нее. Если сталкиваешься с ним, то только как с внешним, не связанным с жизнью, явлением.","My falling away from the faith happened in me just as it happened and is happening now in people of our educational background. It seems to me that in most cases it happens like this: people live the way everyone else lives, and they all live on the basis of principles that not only have nothing in common with dogma, but for the most part are opposite to it; dogma does not participate in life, and in relations with other people one never has to deal with it, and in one's own life one never has to cope with it; this dogma is confessed somewhere out there, far from life and independently of it.

If you come across it, then it is some external phenomenon that has no connection with life.","The decline of my faith occurred in the way in which it has always happened, and still happens, among those from our kind of background.

Religious doctrine is professed in some other realm, at a distance from life and independent of it. If we encounter it, it is only as an external phenomenon, disconnected from life."

"Но я теперь позволяю себе говорить, что это было жестокое требование, тогда же я и не подумал этого, мне только было невыразимо больно. Я уже не был в том положении, в каком я был в молодости, думая, что все в жизни ясно; я пришел ведь к вере потому, что, помимо веры, я ничего, наверное ничего, не нашел, кроме погибели, поэтому откидывать эту веру нельзя было, и я покорился. И я нашел в своей душе чувство, которое помогло мне перенести это. Это было чувство самоунижения и смирения. Я смирился, проглотил эту кровь и тело без кощунственного чувства, с желанием поверить, но удар уже был нанесен. И, зная вперед, что ожидает меня, я уже не мог идти в другой раз.","But now I allow myself to say that this was a cruel demand, at the same time I did not even think of it, I was only inexpressibly hurt.

"Я не так думал тогда, но зародыши этих мыслей уже были во мне. Я понимал, 1) что мое положение с Шопенгауэром и Соломоном, несмотря на нашу мудрость, глупо: мы понимаем, что жизнь есть зло, и все-таки живем. Это явно глупо, потому что, если жизнь глупа, – а я так люблю все разумное, – то надо уничтожить жизнь, и некому будет отрицать ее. 2) Я понимал, что все наши рассуждения вертятся в заколдованном круге, как колесо, не цепляющееся за шестерню. Сколько бы и как бы хорошо мы ни рассуждали, мы не можем получить ответа на вопрос, и всегда будет 0=0, и что потому путь наш, вероятно, ошибочен. 3) Я начинал понимать, что в ответах, даваемых верою, хранится глубочайшая мудрость человечества, и что я не имел права отрицать их на основании разума, и что, главное, ответы эти одни отвечают на вопрос жизни.","I did not think so then, but the germs of these thoughts were already in me. I understood, 1) that my position with Schopenhauer and Solomon, despite our wisdom, is stupid: we understand that life is evil, and yet we live. This is obviously stupid, because if life is stupid - and I love everything reasonable so much - then life must be destroyed, and there will be no one to deny it. 2) I understood that all our reasoning revolves in a vicious circle, like a wheel that does not cling to a gear. No matter how much and no matter how well we argue, we cannot get an answer to the question, and it will always be 0=0, and that is why our path is probably erroneous. 3) I began to understand that the answers given by faith contain the deepest wisdom of mankind, and that I had no right to deny them on the basis of reason, and that, most importantly, these answers alone answer the question of life.","I didn’t think so then, but the germs of those thoughts were already in me. I understood firstly that for all our wisdom my position alongside Schopenhauer and Solomon was a stupid one: we understand that life is evil and still we live. This is clearly stupid because if life is stupid—and I do so love all that is rational—then I should clearly destroy life, and no one would be able to challenge this. Secondly I understood that all our reasoning was going around in a vicious circle, like a wheel that has come off its gear. However much, however well we reason, we cannot give an answer to the question, and it will always be 0 = 0, and so our path is likely to be the wrong one. Thirdly, I began to understand that the answers given to faith enshrine the most profound wisdom of mankind, and that I didn’t have the right to deny them on the grounds of reason, and that, most importantly, these answers do answer the question of life.","I did not think so at the time but the germs of these thoughts were already within me. I realized that: (1) Despite our intelligence the contentions of Schopenhauer, Solomon and myself were foolish: we considered life to be evil and nevertheless continued to live. This was apparent stupidity because, if life is meaningless and I am so fond of reason, then I must destroy life so that no one can deny it. (2) All our arguments went round in a vicious circle, like a wheel that is not attached to the carriage. However much, and however well, we deliberated, we could find no answer to the question because o will always equal o, and therefore, our method must be mistaken. (3) I began to realize that the most profound wisdom of man is preserved in the answers given by faith, and that I did not have the right to negate them on grounds of reason and, above all, that it is these answers alone that can reply to the question of life."
"В это время случилась война в России. И русские стали во имя христианской любви убивать своих братьев. Не думать об этом нельзя было. Не видеть, что убийство есть зло, противное самым первым основам всякой веры, нельзя было. А вместе с тем в церквах молились об успехе нашего оружия, и учители веры признавали это убийство делом, вытекающим из веры. И не только эти убийства на войне, но во время тех смут, которые последовали за войной, я видел членов церкви, учителей ее, монахов, схимников, которые одобряли убийство заблудших беспомощных юношей. И я обратил внимание на все то, что делается людьми, исповедующими христианство, и ужаснулся.","At this time there was a war in Russia. And the Russians began to kill their brothers in the name of Christian love. It was impossible not to think about it. It was impossible not to see that murder is evil, contrary to the very first foundations of any faith, it was impossible. And at the same time, in the churches they prayed for the success of our weapons, and the teachers of the faith recognized this murder as a deed arising from faith. And not only these murders in the war, but during those troubles that followed the war, I saw members of the church, its teachers, monks, hermits, who approved of the murder of erring helpless youths. And I paid attention to everything that is done by people who profess Christianity, and I was horrified.","At that time Russia was fighting a war.31 And Russians began to kill their brethren in the name of Christian love. It was impossible not to think about that. It was also impossible not to see that killing is an evil, is against the very first foundations of every faith.

And it wasn’t just these killings in war but during the disturbances following the war that I saw members of the church, its teachers, monks, hermits, welcoming the killing of lost and helpless young men.32 And I paid attention to everything that was being done by people professing Christianity and I was appalled.","At the time Russia was at war.26 And, in the name of Christian love, Russians were killing their fellow men. It was impossible not to think about this. It was impossible to avoid the fact that killing is evil and contrary to the most basic principles of any faith. And yet prayers were said in the churches for the success of our armies, and our religious teachers acknowledged this killing as an outcome of faith. And this was not only applied to murder in time of war, but, during the troubled times that followed the war, I witnessed members of the Church, her teachers, monks, and ascetics condoning the killing of helpless, lost youths.

"Всему и всем – одно: одна участь праведнику и нечестивому, доброму и злому, чистому и нечистому, приносящему жертву и не приносящему жертвы; как добродетельному, так и грешнику; как клянущемуся, так и боящемуся клятвы.

Кто находится между живыми, тому есть еще надежда, так как и псу живому лучше, нежели мертвому льву. Живые знают, что умрут, а мертвые не знают ничего, и уже нет им воздаяния, потому что и память о них предана забвению; и любовь их, и ненависть их, и ревность их уже исчезли, и нет им более чести вовеки ни в чем, что делается под солнцем».","Everything and everyone is one: one fate for the righteous and the wicked, the good and the evil, the pure and the impure, the one who sacrifices and who does not sacrifice; both the virtuous and the sinner; both the one who swears and the one who fears the oath.

"Мне так необходимо было тогда верить, чтобы жить, что я бессознательно скрывал от себя противоречия и неясности вероучения. Но это осмысливание обрядов имело предел.

"Так я жил, предаваясь этому безумию еще шесть лет, до моей женитьбы. В это время я поехал за границу. Жизнь в Европе и сближение мое с передовыми и учеными европейскими людьми утвердило меня еще больше в той вере совершенствования вообще, которой я жил, потому что ту же самую веру я нашел и у них. Вера эта приняла во мне ту обычную форму, которую она имеет у большинства образованных людей нашего времени. Вера эта выражалась словом «прогресс». Тогда мне казалось, что этим словом выражается что-то. Я не понимал еще того, что, мучимый, как всякий живой человек, вопросами, как мне лучше жить, я, отвечая: жить сообразно с прогрессом, – говорю совершенно то же, что скажет человек, несомый в лодке по волнам и по ветру, на главный и единственный для него вопрос: «Куда держаться?» – если он, не отвечая на вопрос, скажет: «Нас несет куда-то».","So I lived, indulging in this madness for another six years, until my marriage. At this time, I went abroad. Life in Europe and my rapprochement with advanced and learned European people confirmed me even more in the faith of perfection in general, which I lived, because I found the same faith among them. This faith has assumed in me the usual form which it has in the majority of educated people of our time. This belief was expressed by the word ""progress"". Then it seemed to me that something was expressed by this word. I did not yet understand that, tormented, like any living person, with questions about how best to live, I, answering: live in accordance with progress, say exactly the same thing that a person will say, carried in a boat along the waves and along the wind, to the main and only question for him: ""Where to hold on?"" - if he, without answering the question, says: ""We are being carried somewhere.""","I LIVED LIKE THIS, GIVEN OVER TO THIS MADNESS, FOR six years more until my marriage. During this time I traveled abroad. Life in Europe and meeting Europe’s prominent people and scholars confirmed me even more in that belief in general self-perfection by which I lived, because I found that same belief in them too. This belief took in me the usual form it has in the majority of educated people of our time. This belief was expressed by the word “progress.” I thought then that this word did express something. I didn’t yet understand that, tormented like every living man by questions of “How can I live better?,” in answering, “Live in conformity with progress,” I was saying exactly what a man, carried along in a boat by the waves and the wind, will say to the captain when the only question facing him is “Where should I steer for?” if he says without answering the question, “We are being carried along somewhere.”","And so I lived, abandoning myself to this madness, for another six years until I married.3 During this period I went abroad. Life in Europe and the contact I had with advanced and learned Europeans still further reinforced the belief in overall perfection, by which I lived; for I found the same belief among them. With my own self this belief assumed the form it usually takes among the educated men of our time. The belief was expressed in the word ‘progress’. At the time I felt that this word had some meaning. Living as I was then, like any individual I was tormented by the problem of how to live a better life. I did not yet understand that in answering ‘live in conformity with progress’, I was speaking exactly like a person who is in a boat being carried along by wind and waves and who when asked the most important and vital question, ‘Where should I steer?’ avoids answering by saying, ‘We are being carried somewhere.’"
"И я вспомнил весь ход своей внутренней работы и ужаснулся. Теперь мне было ясно, что для того, чтобы человек мог жить, ему нужно или не видеть бесконечного, или иметь такое объяснение смысла жизни, при котором конечное приравнивалось бы бесконечному. Такое объяснение у меня было, но оно мне было ненужно, пока я верил в конечное, и я стал разумом проверять его. И перед светом разума все прежнее объяснение разлетелось прахом. Но пришло время, когда я перестал верить в конечное. И тогда я стал на разумных основаниях строить из того, что я знал, такое объяснение, которое дало бы смысл жизни; но ничего не построилось. Вместе с лучшими умами человечества я пришел к тому, что 0=0, и очень удивился, что получил такое решение, тогда как ничего иного и не могло выйти.","And I remembered the whole course of my inner work and was horrified. Now it was clear to me that in order for a person to live, he must either not see the infinite, or have such an explanation of the meaning of life, in which the finite would be equated with the infinite. I had such an explanation, but it was unnecessary to me as long as I believed in the finite, and I began to test it with my mind. And in front of the light of reason, all the previous explanation shattered into dust. But the time came when I stopped believing in the finite. And then I began to build on reasonable grounds from what I knew, such an explanation that would give the meaning of life; but nothing was built. Together with the best minds of mankind, I came to the conclusion that 0=0, and I was very surprised that I got such a solution, when nothing else could come out.","And I remembered the whole course of my mental labors and I was horrified.

I had such an explanation but I had no need for it while I believed in the finite, and I began to test it by reason. And with the light of reason I found the whole of my previous explanation to dissolve in dust. But there came a time when I stopped believing in the finite. And then I began to construct out of what I knew, on rational foundations, an explanation that would give the meaning of life; but nothing got constructed. Together with mankind’s best minds I came to 0 = 0 and was very surprised to get such a solution when nothing else could come of it.","I recalled the whole course of my inner thinking and was horrified. It was now clear to me that in order for man to live he must either be unaware of the infinite, or he must have some explanation of the meaning of life by which the finite can be equated with the infinite. I had this explanation but it was no use to me while I believed in the finite; and I began to test it against my reason. And in the light of reason my former explanation vanished into thin air. But the time came when I no longer believed in the finite. And then I began, on a rational basis, to construct out of what I knew an explanation which might give a meaning to life; but nothing came of it. Together with the finest human intellects I reached the conclusion that o equals o and was most astonished at reaching this conclusion and that there could be no other."
"Но есть ли или нет этот кто-нибудь, который смеется надо мной, мне от этого не легче. Я не мог придать никакого разумного смысла ни одному поступку, ни всей моей жизни. Меня только удивляло то, как мог я не понимать этого в самом начале. Все это так давно всем известно. Не нынче – завтра придут болезни, смерть (и приходили уже) на любимых людей, на меня, и ничего не останется, кроме смрада и червей. Дела мои, какие бы они ни были, все забудутся – раньше, позднее, да и меня не будет. Так из чего же хлопотать? Как может человек не видеть этого и жить – вот что удивительно! Можно жить только, покуда пьян жизнью; а как протрезвишься, то нельзя не видеть, что все это – только обман, и глупый обман! Вот именно, – что ничего даже нет смешного и остроумного, а просто – жестоко и глупо.","But whether or not there is this someone who laughs at me, it does not make me feel better. I could not give any rational meaning to any act, nor to my whole life. I was only surprised how I could not understand this at the very beginning. All this has been known to everyone for so long. Not today - tomorrow illnesses will come, death (and have already come) on loved ones, on me, and nothing will remain but stench and worms. My deeds, whatever they may be, will all be forgotten - sooner, later, and I will not be. So why bother? How can a person not see this and live - that's what's amazing! One can live only while drunk on life; and when you sober up, you can’t help but see that all this is just a deception, and a stupid deception! That's right - that there is nothing even funny and witty, but simply - cruel and stupid.","But whether there is or isn’t this somebody who was laughing at me gave me no relief. I couldn’t attribute any intelligent meaning to a single act or to the whole of my life. I was surprised that I couldn’t understand that at the very beginning. All this had been known to everyone for so long. One day sickness and death will come (and have come) to my loved ones, to myself, and nothing will remain but stink and worms. My works, of whatever kind, will all be forgotten sooner or later, and I too will not exist. So why worry? How can a man see this and go on living —that is what’s astonishing. You can only live as long as you’re drunk with life; but when you sober up, you can’t help but see that all this is just a fraud, and a stupid fraud. Precisely that: there’s nothing even amusing or witty about it; it’s simply cruel and stupid.","But whether or not this someone laughing at me really existed did not make it any easier for me. I could not attribute any rational meaning to a single act, let alone to my whole life. I simply felt astonished that I had failed to realize this from the beginning. It had all been common knowledge for such a long time. Today or tomorrow sickness and death will come (and they had already arrived) to those dear to me, and to myself, and nothing will remain other than the stench and the worms. Sooner or later my deeds, whatever they may have been, will be forgotten and will no longer exist. What is all the fuss about then? How can a person carry on living and fail to perceive this? That is what is so astonishing! It is only possible to go on living while you are intoxicated with life; once sober it is impossible not to see that it is all a mere trick, and a stupid trick! That is exactly what it is: there is nothing either witty or amusing, it is only cruel and stupid."
"Я делал следующее рассуждение. Я говорил себе: знание веры вытекает, как и все человечество с его разумом, из таинственного начала. Это начало есть бог, начало и тела человеческого, и его разума. Как преемственно от бога дошло до меня мое тело, так дошли до меня мой разум и мое постигновение жизни, и потому все те ступени развития этого постигновения жизни не могут быть ложны. Все то, во что истинно верят люди, должно быть истина; она может быть различно выражаема, но ложью она не может быть, и потому если она мне представляется ложью, то это значит только то, что я не понимаю ее. Кроме того, я говорил себе: сущность всякой веры состоит в том, что она придает жизни такой смысл, который не уничтожается смертью. Естественно, что для того, чтобы вера могла отвечать на вопрос умирающего в роскоши царя, замученного работой старика раба, несмышленого ребенка, мудрого старца, полоумной старухи, молодой счастливой женщины, мятущегося страстями юноши, всех людей при самых разнообразных условиях жизни и образования, – естественно, если есть один ответ, отвечающий на вечный один вопрос жизни: «зачем я живу, что выйдет из моей жизни?» – то ответ этот, хотя единый по существу своему, должен быть бесконечно разнообразен в своих проявлениях; и чем единее, чем истиннее, глубже этот ответ, тем, естественно, страннее и уродливее он должен являться в своих попытках выражения, сообразно образованию и положению каждого. Но рассуждения эти, оправдывающие для меня странность обрядовой стороны веры, были все-таки недостаточны для того, чтобы я сам, в том единственном для меня деле жизни, в вере, позволил бы себе делать поступки, в которых бы я сомневался. Я желал всеми силами души быть в состоянии слиться с народом, исполняя обрядовую сторону его веры; но я не мог этого сделать. Я чувствовал, что я лгал бы перед собой, насмеялся бы над тем, что для меня свято, если бы я делал это. Но тут мне на помощь явились новые, наши русские богословские сочинения.","I made the following argument. I said to myself: the knowledge of faith follows, like all mankind with its mind, from a mysterious beginning. This beginning is God, the beginning of both the human body and its mind. Just as my body came to me successively from God, so did my mind and my comprehension of life come to me, and therefore all those stages of development of this comprehension of life cannot be false. Whatever people truly believe must be true; it can be expressed in various ways, but it cannot be a lie, and therefore if it seems to me a lie, it only means that I do not understand it. In addition, I said to myself: the essence of any faith is that it gives life a meaning that is not destroyed by death. Naturally, in order for faith to be able to answer the question of a king dying in luxury, an old slave tormented by work, an unthinking child, a wise old man, a half-witted old woman, a young happy woman, a young man restless with passions, all people under the most diverse conditions of life and education - naturally, if there is one answer that answers the eternal one question of life: “why do I live, what will come out of my life?” - then this answer, although one in its essence, must be infinitely diverse in its manifestations; and the more united, the truer, the deeper this answer, the more naturally strange and ugly it must appear in its attempts at expression, according to the education and position of each. But these reasonings, which justify for me the strangeness of the ritual side of faith, were still insufficient for me myself, in that only work of life for me, in faith, to allow myself to do things that I would doubt. I wanted with all the strength of my soul to be able to merge with the people, fulfilling the ritual side of their faith; but I couldn't do it. I felt that I would be lying to myself, laughing at what is sacred to me, if I did. But then new, our Russian theological writings came to my aid.","I reasoned as follows. I said to myself: The knowledge of faith rises, like all of mankind with its reason, from a mysterious beginning. The beginning is God, the beginning of man’s body and mind. Just as my body has descended to me from God, so have my reason and my comprehension of life descended to me, and therefore all the stages of development of this comprehension cannot be false. Everything that people truly believe must be the truth; the truth can be expressed in various ways but it cannot be a lie, and therefore if it appears to me as a lie, that only means that I don’t understand it. Furthermore, I said to myself, the essence of my faith lies in its giving life a meaning that is not destroyed with death. Of course, for faith to be able to answer the questions of a tsar dying in luxury, of an old slave worn out by toil, of a simple child, a wise elder, a crazy old woman, a happy young woman, a youth torn by passions, of all people with the most diverse conditions of life and education—of course, if there is a single answer answering the eternal sole question of life, “What do I live for, what will come of my life?”—that answer, though single in its essence, must be endlessly diverse in its manifestations; and the more single, the more true, the deeper this answer, of course the stranger and the more distorted it must appear as it tries to express itself according to the education and social conditions of each man. But these arguments, which justified for me the ritual side of faith, were still not enough to let me perform acts about which I had doubts in the most important matter of my life, in faith. I wished to merge with the people with all the power of my spirit, performing the ritual side of their faith, but I could not do that. I felt that I would be lying in my own eyes, would be mocking what I held sacred, if I did that. But here our new Russian theological writing came to my aid.","I made the following calculation. I told myself that, as with man and his faculty of reason, knowledge of faith arises from a mysterious source. This source is God, the origin of the human mind and body. Just as my body has succeeded to me from God, so too has my reason and my comprehension of life; therefore the stages in the development of this comprehension cannot be false. Those things in which people sincerely believe must be the truth. It may be expressed in various ways but it cannot be a lie. Therefore if I think it is a lie, it can only mean that I do not understand it. And I also said to myself: the essence of any faith consists in giving a meaning to life that will not perish with death. Faith must provide answers to the questions of a Tsar dying in the midst of luxury, an old serf worn out by work, an ignorant child, a wise old man, a half-witted old lady, a happy young woman, and a youth racked with passion. And so, if it is to answer to people living in the most differing circumstances of life and of different education, and if there is only one answer to the eternal questions of life – why do I live? what is the purpose of my life? – this answer, although essentially always the same, must be endlessly varied in its manifestation. The more unique, sincere and profound the answer, the more strange and peculiar it will appear in attempts to give it expression, depending on the education and circumstances of each individual. But these debates, while justifying much that was strange to me about the ritualistic aspects of religion, were nevertheless insufficient to enable me to perform acts I felt dubious about, particularly when it came to the faith that had become the sole concern of my life. With all the powers of my being I wished to be in a position whereby I could merge with the people in fulfilling the ritual aspects of their faith; but I could not do it. I felt that I would be lying to myself, and mocking what I considered sacred, if I were to do so. But at this point I was helped by some new Russian theological works."
"Никогда не забуду мучительного чувства, испытанного мною в тот день, когда я причащался в первый раз после многих лет. Службы, исповедь, правила – все это было мне понятно и производило во мне радостное сознание того, что смысл жизни открывается мне. Самое причастие я объяснял себе как действие, совершаемое в воспоминание Христа и означающее очищение от греха и полное восприятие учения Христа. Если это объяснение и было искусственно, то я не замечал его искусственности. Мне так радостно было, унижаясь и смиряясь перед духовником, простым робким священником, выворачивать всю грязь своей души, каясь в своих пороках, так радостно было сливаться мыслями с стремлениями отцов, писавших молитвы правил, так радостно было единение со всеми веровавшими и верующими, что я и не чувствовал искусственности моего объяснения. Но когда я подошел к царским дверям и священник заставил меня повторить то, что я верю, что то, что я буду глотать, есть истинное тело и кровь, меня резнуло по сердцу; это мало что фальшивая нота, это жестокое требование кого-то такого, который, очевидно, никогда и не знал, что такое вера.","I will never forget the painful feeling I experienced on the day when I took communion for the first time after many years. Services, confession, rules - all this was clear to me and produced in me a joyful consciousness that the meaning of life was being revealed to me. Communion itself I explained to myself as an action performed in remembrance of Christ and signifying cleansing from sin and full acceptance of the teachings of Christ. If this explanation was artificial, then I did not notice its artificiality. It was so joyful for me, humbled and humbled before my spiritual father, a simple timid priest, to turn out all the dirt of my soul, repenting of my vices, it was so joyful to merge in my thoughts with the aspirations of the fathers who wrote the prayers of the rules, it was so joyful to unite with all those who believed and believed that I did not feel the artificiality of my explanation. But when I approached the royal doors and the priest made me repeat what I believe, that what I will swallow is the true body and blood, it cut me to the heart; it's not much of a wrong note, it's a cruel demand from someone who obviously never knew what faith is.","I will never forget the feeling of torment I underwent when I took communion for the first time in many years. The services, confession, the ritual prayers—all that I could understand and brought about within me the joyous recognition of the meaning of life opening up to me. Taking communion itself I explained to myself as an action commemorating Christ and signifying cleansing from sin and a full understanding of Christ’s teaching. If this explanation was artificial I didn’t notice its artificiality. I was so full of joy, submitting and humbling myself before the confessor, a simple, timid priest, and exposing all the filth of my soul; I was so full of joy at my thoughts merging with the aspirations of the fathers who wrote the ritual prayers; I was so full of joy to be one with all believers, past and present, that I did not feel the artificiality of my explanation. But when I went up to the “Tsar’s Gates”22 the priest made me repeat what I believe, that what I swallow is true flesh and blood, and I felt cut to the heart; it wasn’t just a false note struck, it was a brutal requirement of someone who clearly had never known what faith is.","I shall never forget the tormenting feeling that I experienced on the day I received communion for the first time in many years. The service, the priest, the rules of prayer,16 were all something I could understand, and created in me a joyful realization that the meaning of life was being revealed. The communion itself I interpreted as an act performed in memory of Christ, signifying the purification of sin and the full acceptance of Christ’s teachings. If this explanation was artificial I failed to notice its falsity. As I bowed down and humbled myself before the confessor, a simple, timid priest, I felt so happy to be shaking loose all the dirt in my soul, repenting all my sins, so happy to be united in thought with the aspirations of the Fathers who had written the prayers of the office, so happy to be united with all those who have and who do believe, that I failed to notice the artificiality of my interpretations. But when I approached the Royal Doors and the priest asked me to repeat what I believe, and that what I was about to receive was actually the body and blood, my heart contracted; it was more than a false note , it was a cruel demand made by someone who evidently had never known what faith is."
"Все эти сомнения, которые теперь я в состоянии высказать более или менее связно, тогда я не мог бы высказать. Тогда я только чувствовал, что, как ни логически неизбежны были мои, подтверждаемые величайшими мыслителями, выводы о тщете жизни, в них было что-то неладно. В самом ли рассуждении, в постановке ли вопроса, я не знал; я чувствовал только, что убедительность разумная была совершенная, но что ее было мало. Все эти доводы не могли убедить меня так, чтоб я сделал то, что вытекало из моих рассуждений, т. е. чтоб я убил себя. И я бы сказал неправду, если бы сказал, что я разумом пришел к тому, к чему я пришел, и не убил себя. Разум работал, но работало и еще что-то другое, что я не могу назвать иначе, как сознанием жизни. Работала еще та сила, которая заставляла меня обращать внимание на то, а не на это, и эта-то сила и вывела меня из моего отчаянного положения и совершенно иначе направила разум. Эта сила заставила меня обратить внимание на то, что я с сотнями подобных мне людей не есть все человечество, что жизни человечества я еще не знаю.","All these doubts, which I am now able to express more or less coherently, then I could not express. Then I only felt that, no matter how logically inevitable my conclusions about the futility of life, confirmed by the greatest thinkers, were, something was wrong with them. Whether in the reasoning itself, or in the formulation of the question, I did not know; I only felt that the reasonable persuasiveness was perfect, but that it was not enough. All these arguments could not persuade me to do what followed from my reasoning, that is, to kill myself. And I would be telling a lie if I said that I came to what I came to by reason and did not kill myself. The mind worked, but something else also worked, which I cannot call otherwise than the consciousness of life. There was also a force at work that forced me to pay attention to this, and not to that, and it was this force that brought me out of my desperate situation and directed my mind in a completely different way. This force made me pay attention to the fact that I, with hundreds of people like me, do not have the whole of humanity, that I still do not know the life of humanity.","ALL THESE DOUBTS, WHICH I AM NOW CAPABLE OF expressing more or less coherently , I couldn’t express then. Then I only felt that however logically inevitable my conclusions about the vanity of life, confirmed by the greatest thinkers, there was something wrong in them. Whether in the actual argument or in putting the question, I didn’t know; I only felt that the force of the reasoning was complete but that that wasn’t enough. All these conclusions couldn’t convince me to the point that I did what followed from my reasoning—that I killed myself. And I would be telling a lie if I said that it was reason that brought me to the conclusion I reached and that I didn’t kill myself. My reason was working, but something else was also working which I can only call consciousness of life. There was also a force working that made me pay attention to one thing rather than another, and that force also took me out of my desperate condition and set my reason onto a quite different course. This force made me pay attention to the fact that I and hundreds of people like me were not the whole of mankind, that I didn’t yet know the life of mankind.","None of these doubts, which I can now express more or less coherently, could I have formulated at the time. At the time I simply felt that despite the fact that my deductions about the vanity of life were logically unavoidable and were confirmed by the greatest thinkers, there was still something wrong with them. Whether it was in my reasoning, or whether it was in my formulation of the question, I did not know. I simply felt that the reasoning behind my conviction was complete, but that it was not enough. All these conclusions failed to persuade me to follow my argument to its end, that is to kill myself. I would not be speaking the truth if I said that it was through my reason that I arrived where I did and yet did not kill myself. My reason was working, but so too was something else that I can only call a consciousness of life. There was also another force at work which made me pay attention to the latter and not to the former. It was this force that led me out of my state of despair and guided my reason in an entirely different direction. It compelled me to pay attention to the fact that I, and the hundreds of others similar to myself, do not comprise the whole of humanity, and that I still did not know what this life of humanity was."
"«Жизнь есть то, чего не должно бы быть, – зло, и переход в ничто есть единственное благо жизни», – говорит Шопенгауэр.","""Life is what should not be - evil, and the transition to nothingness is the only good of life,"" says Schopenhauer.","“Life is that which ought not to be—an evil—and the going into nothingness is the sole good of life,” says Schopenhauer.","‘Life is that which it should not be: evil. The transition into nothingness is the only thing sacred in life,’says Schopenhauer."

"Вера эта в значение поэзии и в развитие жизни была вера, и я был одним из жрецов ее. Быть жрецом ее было очень выгодно и приятно. И я довольно долго жил в этой вере, не сомневаясь в ее истинности. Но на второй и в особенности на третий год такой жизни я стал сомневаться в непогрешимости этой веры и стал ее исследовать. Первым поводом к сомнению было то, что я стал замечать, что жрецы этой веры не все были согласны между собою. Одни говорили: мы – самые хорошие и полезные учители, мы учим тому, что нужно, а другие учат неправильно. А другие говорили: нет, мы – настоящие, а вы учите неправильно. И они спорили, ссорились, бранились, обманывали, плутовали друг против друга. Кроме того, было много между ними людей и не заботящихся о том, кто прав, кто не прав, а просто достигающих своих корыстных целей с помощью этой нашей деятельности. Все это заставило меня усомниться в истинности нашей веры.","This faith in the meaning of poetry and in the development of life was faith, and I was one of its priests. Being her priest was very profitable and pleasant. And I lived in this faith for quite a long time, not doubting its truth. But in the second and especially in the third year of such a life, I began to doubt the infallibility of this faith and began to investigate it. The first reason for doubt was that I began to notice that the priests of this faith did not all agree with each other. Some said: we are the most good and useful teachers, we teach what is needed, while others teach wrong. And others said: no, we are real, and you teach wrong. And they argued, quarreled, scolded, deceived, cheated against each other. In addition, there were many people among them who did not care about who was right and who was wrong, but simply achieved their own selfish goals with the help of our activities. All this made me doubt the truth of our faith.","This belief in the meaning of poetry and the development of life was a religious faith, and I was one of its priests.

"Тогда я не замечал этого. Только изредка не разум, а чувство возмущалось против этого общего в наше время суеверия, которым люди заслоняют от себя свое непонимание жизни. Так, в бытность мою в Париже, вид смертной казни обличил мне шаткость моего суеверия прогресса. Когда я увидал, как голова отделилась от тела и то и другое врозь застучало в ящике, я понял – не умом, а всем существом, – что никакие теории разумности существующего и прогресса не могут оправдать этого поступка и что если бы все люди в мире, по каким бы то ни было теориям, с сотворения мира, находили, что это нужно, – я знаю, что это не нужно, что это дурно и что поэтому судья тому, что хорошо и нужно, не то, что говорят и делают люди, и не прогресс, а я с своим сердцем. Другой случай сознания недостаточности для жизни суеверия прогресса была смерть моего брата. Умный, добрый, серьезный человек, он заболел молодым, страдал более года и мучительно умер, не понимая, зачем он жил, и еще менее понимая, зачем он умирает. Никакие теории ничего не могли ответить на эти вопросы ни мне, ни ему во время его медленного и мучительного умирания.","Then I did not notice it. Only occasionally, not reason, but feeling, was indignant against this superstition common in our time, by which people screen their misunderstanding of life from themselves. Thus, during my stay in Paris, the sight of the death penalty revealed to me the fragility of my superstition of progress. When I saw how the head separated from the body and both of them pounded apart in the box, I realized - not with my mind, but with my whole being - that no theories of the rationality of the existing and progress can justify this act and that if all people in the world, according to whatever theories, since the creation of the world, it has been found that this is necessary - I know that this is not necessary, that it is bad and that therefore the judge of what is good and necessary is not what people say and do, and not progress, but me with my heart. Another case of the consciousness of the insufficiency for a life of superstition of progress was the death of my brother. An intelligent, kind, serious man, he fell ill young, suffered for more than a year and died painfully, not understanding why he lived, and even less understanding why he was dying. No theories could answer these questions for me or for him during his slow and painful death.","I didn’t see that then. Only from time to time not my reason but my feelings revolted against this generally prevalent superstition with which people conceal their lack of understanding of life in our time. Thus during my stay in Paris the sight of an execution disclosed to me the shaky foundations of my superstitious belief in progress. When I saw the head parted from the body and both head and body separately falling noisily into the bin, then I understood—not with my mind but with my whole being—that no theories of the rationality of existence and progress could justify this act, and if all the people of the world, from the world’s creation, according to whatever theories, were to find that this is necessary—I knew that it was not necessary, that it was bad, and that therefore the judge of what is good and necessary is not what people say and do, but I myself and my heart. Another occasion of the inadequacy of the superstition of progress was the death of my brother.7 A clever, kind, serious man, he fell ill while still young, suffered for more than a year, and died in agony, without understanding why he had lived and understanding still less why he was dying. No theories could give any answer to these questions either for me or for him during the time of his slow and agonizing dying.","At the time I noticed none of this. Only occasionally, led more by instinct than reason, I rebelled against the superstition so prevalent in our age by which people shield themselves from their failure to understand life. Thus, during my stay in Paris, the sight of an execution revealed to me the precariousness of my superstition in progress. When I saw the heads being separated from the bodies and heard them thump, one after the next, into the box I understood, and not just with my intellect but with my whole being, that no theories of the rationality of existence and progress could justify this crime. I realized that even if every single person since the day of creation had, according to whatever theory, found this necessary I knew that it was unnecessary and wrong, and therefore that judgements on what is good and necessary must not be based on what other people say and do, or on progress, but on the instincts of my own soul. Another instance in which I felt that the superstition of progress was inadequate in regard to life was the death of my brother.4 He was an intelligent, kind-hearted, serious man who became ill when he was young, suffered for over a year and died in torment without having understood why he had lived, and still less why he was dying. No theories could provide the answers to these questions, either for him or for me, during his slow and tortuous death."
"И мне казалось, что я этому выучился за границей, и, вооруженный всей этой премудростью, я в год освобождения крестьян вернулся в Россию и, заняв место посредника, стал учить и необразованный народ в школах, и образованных людей в журнале, который я начал издавать. Дело, казалось, шло хорошо, но я чувствовал, что я не совсем умственно здоров и долго это не может продолжаться.

Things seemed to be going well, but I felt that I was not quite mentally healthy and could not continue for long. And then, perhaps, I would have come to that despair to which I came at the age of fifty, if I had not had one more side of life that I had not yet experienced and promised me salvation: it was family life.","And I thought I had learned this abroad and, armed with this great wisdom, I returned to Russia in the year of the emancipation of the peasants9 and, taking up the post of arbitrator,10 I started teaching the uneducated folk in schools and the educated in a journal I began to publish.

And then perhaps I would have come to that despair I came to at the age of fifty if I hadn’t had another side of life that I hadn’t yet experienced and which promised me salvation: that was family life.","I thought I learnt this there, and equipped with all this wisdom I returned to Russia in the year of the Emancipation of the Serfs.6 I took up the position of arbitrator and started teaching the uneducated people in the schools, as well as the educated people through the journal I had begun publishing. This seemed to be going well but I felt that my mental state was not altogether healthy and that this could not continue for long. I might perhaps have fallen at this time into the same despair that I fell into when I was fifty if there had not been one aspect of life I had not yet experienced and which promised salvation: this was family life."
"Так что, кроме разумного знания, которое мне прежде представлялось единственным, я был неизбежно приведен к признанию того, что у всего живущего человечества есть еще какое-то другое знание, неразумное – вера, дающая возможность жить. Вся неразумность веры оставалась для меня та же, как и прежде, но я не мог не признать того, что она одна дает человечеству ответы на вопросы жизни и, вследствие того, возможность жить.","So, in addition to rational knowledge, which had previously seemed to me the only one, I was inevitably led to the recognition that all living mankind has some other kind of knowledge, unreasonable - faith, which makes it possible to live. All the irrationality of faith remained for me the same as before, but I could not but admit that it alone gives mankind answers to the questions of life and, consequently, the opportunity to live.","So apart from rational science, which previously seemed to me the only one, I was inescapably led to recognize that the whole of living mankind has another irrational science—faith, which gives the possibility of living. All the irrationality of faith remained the same for me as before but I couldn’t fail to recognize that it alone gives mankind answers to the questions of life and consequently the possibility of living.","Thus in addition to rational knowledge, which I had hitherto thought to be the only knowledge, I was inevitably led to acknowledge that there does exist another kind of knowledge – an irrational one – possessed by humanity as a whole: faith, which affords the possibility of living. Faith remained as irrational to me as before, but I could not fail to recognize that it alone provides mankind with the answers to the question of life, and consequently with the possibility of life."
"Случилось то, что случается с каждым заболевающим смертельною внутреннею болезнью. Сначала появляются ничтожные признаки недомогания, на которые больной не обращает внимания, потом признаки эти повторяются чаще и чаще и сливаются в одно нераздельное по времени страдание. Страдание растет, и больной не успеет оглянуться, как уже сознает, что то, что он принимал за недомогание, есть то, что для него значительнее всего в мире, что это – смерть.","What happened to everyone who falls ill with a deadly internal disease has happened. At first, insignificant signs of indisposition appear, to which the patient does not pay attention, then these signs are repeated more and more often and merge into one suffering that is inseparable in time. Suffering grows, and the patient does not have time to look back, as he already realizes that what he took for an indisposition is what is most significant for him in the world, that this is death.","There happened what happens to everyone who falls ill with a mortal internal disease. At first there appear some insignificant symptoms of indisposition to which the sick man pays no attention, then these symptoms recur more and more often and merge into one continuous suffering. The suffering grows and before the sick man has time to look around, he recognizes that what he took for exhaustion is the thing that is for him more important than anything in the world—that it’s death.","And then, what happens to everyone stricken with a fatal inner disease happened to me. At first minor signs of indisposition appear, which the sick person ignores; then these symptoms appear more and more frequently, merging into one interrupted period of suffering. The suffering increases and before the sick man realizes what is happening he discovers that the thing he had taken for an indisposition is in fact the thing that is more important to him than anything in the world: it is death."
"В рассуждениях моих я постоянно приравнивал, да и не мог поступить иначе, конечное к конечному и бесконечное к бесконечному, а потому у меня и выходило, что и должно было выходить: сила есть сила, вещество есть вещество, воля есть воля, бесконечность есть бесконечность, ничто есть ничто, и дальше ничего не могло выйти.","In my reasoning, I constantly equated, and could not do otherwise, the finite with the finite and the infinite with the infinite, and therefore it turned out for me that it should have come out: force is force, matter is matter, will is will, infinity is infinity , nothing is nothing, and nothing could go further.","In my reasoning I constantly equated—I couldn’t do otherwise—finite with finite and infinite with infinite, and so the result I got was what it had to be: a force is a force , a substance is a substance, will is will, infinity is infinity, nothing is nothing, and there could be no further result.","In my deliberations I was continually drawing comparisons between the finite and the finite, and the infinite and the infinite, and I could not have done otherwise. Thus I reached the only conclusion I could reach: force is force, matter is matter, will is will, the infinite is the infinite, nothing is nothing; and I could go no further than that."
"Прежний обман радостей жизни, заглушавший ужас дракона, уже не обманывает меня. Сколько ни говори мне: ты не можешь понять смысла жизни, не думай, живи, – я не могу делать этого, потому что слишком долго делал это прежде. Теперь я не могу не видеть дня и ночи, бегущих и ведущих меня к смерти. Я вижу это одно, потому что это одно – истина. Остальное все – ложь.","The former deception of the joys of life, which drowned out the horror of the dragon, no longer deceives me. No matter how much you tell me: you cannot understand the meaning of life, do not think, live - I cannot do this, because I have done this for too long before. Now I can't help but see the day and night running and leading me to death. I see this one because this one is the truth. Everything else is a lie.","The former illusion of the joys of life, which used to suppress the horror of the dragon, deceives me no more. Only do not tell me, “You can’t understand the meaning of life; don’t think, live”—I can’t do that because I did it for too long before. Now I can’t help seeing day and night running along and leading me to death. I see only this because only this is the truth. All the rest is lies.","The delusion of the joys of life that had formerly stifled my fear of the dragon no longer deceived me. No matter how many times I am told: you cannot understand the meaning of life, do not think about it but live, I cannot do so because I have already done it for too long. Now I cannot help seeing day and night chasing me and leading me to my death. This is all I can see because it is the only truth. All the rest is a lie."
"Если бы пришла волшебница и предложила мне исполнить мои желания, я бы не знал, что сказать. Если есть у меня не желания, но привычки желаний прежних, в пьяные минуты, то я в трезвые минуты знаю, что это – обман, что нечего желать. Даже узнать истину я не мог желать, потому что я догадывался, в чем она состояла. Истина была то, что жизнь есть бессмыслица.","If a sorceress came and asked me to grant my wishes, I wouldn't know what to say. If I have not desires, but the habits of former desires, in drunken moments, then in sober moments I know that this is a deception, that there is nothing to desire. I could not even desire to know the truth, because I guessed what it consisted of. The truth was that life is nonsense.","If an enchantress had come and offered to fulfill my desires for me, I wouldn’t have known what to say. If in drunken moments I did have not so much desires as the habits of old desires, then in sober moments I knew that it was delusion, that there was nothing to desire. I could not even desire to learn the truth because I guessed wherein it lay. The truth was that life is nonsense.","If a magician had come and offered to grant my wishes I would not have known what to say. If in my intoxicated moments I still had the habit of desire, rather than real desire, in my sober moments I knew that it was a delusion and that I wanted nothing. I did not even wish to know the truth because I had guessed what it was. The truth was that life is meaningless."
