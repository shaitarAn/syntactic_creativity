"Варвара Алексеевна, родная моя!","Varvara Alekseevna, my dear!","MY OWN BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,—Today, dearest, I saw Thedora, who informed me that you are to be married tomorrow, and on the following day to go away—for which purpose Bwikov has ordered a post-chaise....","Varvara Alekseyevna, my darling!","VARVARA ALEXYEVITCH, MY OWN,"
"Я не знала, что мне оставалось делать, куда было деваться от стыда. Одно то, что он застал меня в своей комнате! Целых три дня я на него взглянуть не могла. Я краснела до слез. Мысли самые странные, мысли смешные вертелись в голове моей. Одна из них, самая сумасбродная, была та, что я хотела идти к нему, объясниться с ним, признаться ему во всем, откровенно рассказать ему все и уверить его, что я поступила не как глупая девочка, но с добрым намерением. Я было и совсем решилась идти, но, слава богу, смелости не достало. Воображаю, что бы я наделала! Мне и теперь обо всем этом вспоминать совестно.","I didn't know what to do, where to go from shame. Just the fact that he found me in his room! For three whole days I could not look at him. I blushed to tears. The strangest thoughts, funny thoughts swirled in my head. One of them, the most extravagant, was the one that I wanted to go to him, explain myself to him, confess everything to him, tell him everything frankly and assure him that I did not act like a stupid girl, but with a good intention. I made up my mind to go, but, thank God, I didn't have the courage. Imagine what I would do! I am ashamed to remember all this now.","What to do with myself for shame I could not think. The one thought in my head was that he had surprised me in his room. For three whole days I found myself unable to raise my eyes to his, but blushed always to the point of weeping. The strangest and most confused of thoughts kept entering my brain. One of them—the most extravagant—was that I should dearly like to go to Pokrovski, and to explain to him the situation, and to make full confession, and to tell him everything without concealment, and to assure him that I had not acted foolishly as a minx, but honestly and of set purpose. In fact, I DID make up my mind to take this course, but lacked the necessary courage to do it. If I had done so, what a figure I should have cut! Even now I am ashamed to think of it.","I did not know what there was left for me to do, or where to hide my head in shame. The mere fact that he had caught me in his room! For three entire days I was unable to bring myself even to look at him. I kept blushing to the point of tears. The strangest, most ridiculous thoughts kept whirling about in my head. One of them, the wildest, was a desire to go to him, have it out with him, confess everything to him, frankly tell him all and convince him that I had behaved not as a stupid little girl, but with good intentions. I had almost made up my mind to do this, but, thank God, found that I did not possess the necessary courage. I can imagine what a fool of myself I should have made! Even now I have pangs of conscience at the memory of the whole episode.","I did not know what to do, where to hide myself for shame. The mere fact that he had found me in his room was enough! For three whole days I could not look at him: I blushed until the tears came into my eyes. The most absurd ideas whirled through my brain. One of them—the maddest—was a plan to go to him, explain myself to him, confess everything to him, tell him all openly and assure him I had not behaved like a silly little girl but had acted with good intentions. I quite resolved to go but, thank God, my courage failed me. I can imagine what a mess I should have made of it! Even now I am ashamed to remember it all."
"Покровский был бедный, очень бедный молодой человек; здоровье его не позволяло ему ходить постоянно учиться, и его так, по привычке только, звали у нас студентом. Жил он скромно, смирно, тихо, так что и не слышно бывало его из нашей комнаты. С виду он был такой странный; так неловко ходил, так неловко раскланивался, так чудно говорил, что я сначала на него без смеху и смотреть не могла. Саша беспрерывно над ним проказничала, особенно когда он нам уроки давал. А он вдобавок был раздражительного характера, беспрестанно сердился, за каждую малость из себя выходил, кричал на нас, жаловался на нас и часто, не докончив урока, рассерженный уходил в свою комнату. У себя же он по целым дням сидел за книгами. У него было много книг, и всё такие дорогие, редкие книги. Он кое-где еще учил, получал кое-какую плату, так что чуть, бывало, у него заведутся деньги, так он тотчас идет себе книг покупать.","Pokrovsky was a poor, very poor young man; his health did not allow him to go to study all the time, and he was so, out of habit only, called us a student. He lived modestly, quietly, quietly, so that he could not be heard from our room. He looked so strange; he walked so awkwardly, bowed so awkwardly, spoke so wonderfully that at first I could not even look at him without laughing. Sasha constantly played pranks on him, especially when he gave us lessons. In addition, he was of an irritable nature, constantly angry, lost his temper for every little thing, shouted at us, complained about us, and often, without finishing the lesson, went angry to his room. At home, he spent whole days sitting at books. He had many books, and all such expensive, rare books. He also taught here and there, received some pay, so that as soon as he got money, he immediately went to buy books for himself.","The latter was a poor—a very poor—young man whose health would not permit of his undertaking the regular university course. Indeed, it was only for form’s sake that we called him “The Student.” He lived in such a quiet, humble, retiring fashion that never a sound reached us from his room. Also, his exterior was peculiar—he moved and walked awkwardly, and uttered his words in such a strange manner that at first I could never look at him without laughing. Sasha was for ever playing tricks upon him—more especially when he was giving us our lessons. But unfortunately, he was of a temperament as excitable as herself. Indeed, he was so irritable that the least trifle would send him into a frenzy, and set him shouting at us, and complaining of our conduct. Sometimes he would even rush away to his room before school hours were over, and sit there for days over his books, of which he had a store that was both rare and valuable. In addition, he acted as teacher at another establishment, and received payment for his services there; and, whenever he had received his fees for this extra work, he would hasten off and purchase more books.","Pokrovsky was poor – a very poor young man; his health did not permit him to follow any continuous course of study, and it was merely out of habit that we referred to him as ‘the student’. He lived modestly, peacefully, and quietly, and no sound of him could be heard from our room. His appearance was rather odd; so awkwardly did he walk, so awkwardly did he bow, and so strangely did he speak that at first I could not look at him without laughing. Sasha was forever playing pranks on him, especially when he was giving us our lessons. Also, he had an irritabledisposition – heconstantly got angry, losing his temper over the merest trifles, shouted at us, complained about us and frequently went off to his room in a rage, without having completed the lesson. Left to himself, however, he would sit poring over his books for days on end. He had a lot of books, and they were all expensive, rare ones. He gave lessons in a few other places as well, and received some kind of payment for them; as soon as he had any money, he would at once go out and buy books.","Pokrovsky was poor, very poor. His health had prevented him from continuing his studies and it was only from habit that he was called a student. He was so retiring, so quiet and so still that we heard no sound of him from our room. He was very queer-looking; he walked so awkwardly, bowed so awkwardly and spoke so queerly that at first I could not look at him without laughing. Sasha was continually mocking at him, especially when he was giving us our lessons. He was of an irritable temper, too, was constantly getting cross, was beside himself about every trifle, scolded us, complained of us, and often went off into his own room in anger without finishing the lesson. He used to sit for days together over his books. He had a great many books, and such rare and expensive books. He gave other lessons, too, for which he was paid, and as soon as ever he had money he would go and buy books."

"– Небо и земля, благодарю вас! я счастлив!.. Вы дали мне все, все, к чему с отроческих лет стремился взволнованный дух мой. Так вот куда вела ты меня, моя звезда путеводная; так вот для чего ты привела меня сюда, за Каменный Пояс! Я покажу всему свету мою Зюлейку, и люди, бешеные чудовища, не посмеют обвинять меня! О, если им понятны эти тайные страдания ее нежной души, если они способны видеть целую поэму в одной слезинке моей Зюлейки! О, дай мне стереть поцелуями эту слезинку, дай мне выпить ее, эту небесную слезинку… неземная!","Heaven and earth, thank you! I am happy!.. You gave me everything, everything that my excited spirit aspired to from adolescence. So this is where you led me, my guiding star; so that's why you brought me here, beyond the Stone Belt! I will show my Zyuleika to the whole world, and people, rabid monsters, will not dare to accuse me! Oh, if they understand these secret sufferings of her tender soul, if they are able to see a whole poem in one tear of my Zyuleika! Oh, let me wipe away this tear with kisses, let me drink it, this heavenly tear ... unearthly!","“‘Then by heaven and earth I thank you! By heaven and earth you have made me happy! You have given me all, all that my tortured soul has for immemorial years been seeking! ‘ Tis for this that you have led me hither, my guiding star—‘tis for this that you have conducted me to the Girdle of Stone! To all the world will I now show my Zuleika, and no man, demon or monster of Hell, shall bid me nay! Oh, if men would but understand the mysterious passions of her tender heart, and see the poem which lurks in each of her little tears! Suffer me to dry those tears with my kisses! Suffer me to drink of those heavenly drops, Oh being who art not of this earth!’","‘By the earth and all the heavens, I thank you! I am happy! . . You have given me all, all for which my storm-tossed spirit has striven ever since I was a lad. So it is hither you have led me, my guiding star; so this is why you have led me hither, beyond the Kamenny Poyas. * I will show my Suleika to the whole world, and men, those ferocious monsters, will not dare to accuse me! Oh, if they understood those secret sufferings of her tender soul, if they were able to see an entire poem in one single tear of my Suleika! O, let me brush away that tear with kisses, let me drink it, that divine tear… woman not of this world!’","“ ‘Heaven and earth, I thank you! I am happy! ... You have given me everything, everything, for which my turbulent soul has striven from my boyhood’s years. So it was to this thou hast led me, my guiding star, so it was for this thou hast led me here, beyond the Belt of Stone! I will show to all the world my Zuleika, and men, the frantic monsters, will not dare to blame me! Ah, if they could understand the secret sufferings of her tender soul, if they could see a whole poem in a tear of my Zuleika! Oh, let me dry that tear with kisses , let me drink it up, that heavenly tear.. unearthly one!’"
"Ну уж, как теперь все кончено и все мало-помалу приходит в прежнее положение, то вот что скажу я вам, маточка: вы беспокоитесь об том, что обо мне подумают, на что спешу объявить вам, Варвара Алексеевна, что амбиция моя мне дороже всего. Вследствие чего и донося вам об несчастиях моих и всех этих беспорядках, уведомляю вас, что из начальства еще никто ничего не знает, да и не будет знать, так что они все будут питать ко мне уважение по-прежнему. Одного боюсь: сплетен боюсь. Дома у нас хозяйка кричит, а теперь, когда я с помощию ваших десяти рублей уплатил ей часть долга, только ворчит, а более ничего. Что же касается до прочих, то и они ничего; у них только не нужно денег взаймы просить, а то и они ничего. А в заключение объяснений моих скажу вам, маточка, что ваше уважение ко мне считаю я выше всего на свете и тем утешаюсь теперь во временных беспорядках моих. Слава богу, что первый удар и первые передряги миновали и вы приняли это так, что не считаете меня вероломным другом и себялюбцем за то, что я вас у себя держал и обманывал вас, не в силах будучи с вами расстаться и любя вас, как моего ангельчика. Рачительно теперь принялся за службу и должность свою стал исправлять хорошо. Евстафий Иванович хоть бы слово сказал, когда я мимо их вчера проходил. Не скрою от вас, маточка, что убивают меня долги мои и худое положение моего гардероба, но это опять ничего, и об этом тоже молю вас – не отчаивайтесь, маточка. Посылаете мне еще полтинничек, Варенька, и этот полтинничек мне мое сердце пронзил. Так так-то оно теперь стало, так вот оно как! то есть это не я, старый дурак, вам, ангельчику, помогаю, а вы, сироточка моя бедненькая, мне! Хорошо сделала Федора, что достала денег. Я покамест не имею надежд никаких, маточка, на получение, а если чуть возродятся какие-нибудь надежды, то отпишу вам обо всем подробно. Но сплетни, сплетни меня беспокоят более всего. Прощайте, мой ангельчик. Целую вашу ручку и умоляю вас выздоравливать. Пишу оттого не подробно, что в должность спешу, ибо старанием и рачением хочу загладить все вины мои в упущении по службе; дальнейшее же повествование о всех происшествиях и о приключении с офицерами откладываю до вечера.","Well, as it’s all over now and everything is gradually returning to its former state, then I’ll tell you this, mother: you are worried about what they will think of me, to which I hasten to announce to you, Varvara Alekseevna, that my ambition is dearer to me Total. As a result, and informing you about my misfortunes and all these disorders, I inform you that no one from the authorities still knows anything, and will not know, so they will all respect me as before. I'm afraid of one thing: I'm afraid of gossip. At home, the hostess screams, but now, when I paid her part of the debt with the help of your ten rubles, she only grumbles, but nothing more. As for the rest, they are nothing; they just do not need to ask for a loan, otherwise they will do nothing. And in conclusion of my explanations, I will tell you, mother, that I consider your respect for me above everything in the world, and thus I now console myself in my temporary disturbances. Thank God that the first blow and the first troubles have passed and you have accepted it in such a way that you do not consider me a treacherous friend and selfish person for keeping you at my place and deceiving you, unable to part with you and loving you as mine. angel. Carefully now he set to work and began to correct his position well. Evstafy Ivanovich at least said a word when I passed by them yesterday. I will not hide from you, mother, that my debts and the poor state of my wardrobe are killing me, but this is nothing again, and I also beg you about this - do not despair, mother. Send me another fifty dollars, Varenka, and this fifty dollars has pierced my heart. So that's how it is now, so that's how it is! that is, it's not me, the old fool, I'm helping you, angel, but you, my poor little orphan, to me! Fedor did well that she got the money. For the time being, my mother, I have no hopes of receiving, and if any hopes are slightly revived, I will write to you about everything in detail. But gossip, gossip bothers me the most. Farewell, my angel. I kiss your hand and beg you to get well. I am not writing in detail because I am in a hurry to take up my post, because by diligence and diligence I want to make amends for all my faults in the omission in the service; I put off further narration about all the incidents and about the adventure with the officers until the evening.","ALEXIEVNA,—What am I to say to you, now that all is over, and we are gradually returning to our old position? You say that you are anxious as to what will be thought of me. Let me tell you that the dearest thing in life to me is my self-respect; wherefore, in informing you of my misfortunes and misconduct, I would add that none of my superiors know of my doings, nor ever will know of them, and that therefore, I still enjoy a measure of respect in that quarter. Only one thing do I fear—I fear gossip. Garrulous though my landlady be, she said but little when, with the aid of your ten roubles, I today paid her part of her account; and as for the rest of my companions, they do not matter at all. So long as I have not borrowed money from them, I need pay them no attention. To conclude my explanations, let me tell you that I value your respect for me above everything in the world, and have found it my greatest comfort during this temporary distress of mine. Thank God, the first shock of things has abated, now that you have agreed not to look upon me as faithless and an egotist simply because I have deceived you. I wish to hold you to myself, for the reason that I cannot bear to part with you, and love you as my guardian angel.... I have now returned to work, and am applying myself diligently to my duties. Also, yesterday Evstafi Ivanovitch exchanged a word or two with me. Yet I will not conceal from you the fact that my debts are crushing me down, and that my wardrobe is in a sorry state. At the same time, these things do not REALLY matter and I would bid you not despair about them. Send me, however, another half-rouble if you can (though that half-rouble will stab me to the heart—stab me with the thought that it is not I who am helping you, but YOU who are helping ME). Thedora has done well to get those fifteen roubles for you. At the moment, fool of an old man that I am, I have no hope of acquiring any more money; but as soon as ever I do so, I will write to you and let you know all about it. What chiefly worries me is the fear of gossip. Goodbye, little angel. I kiss your hands, and beseech you to regain your health. If this is not a detailed letter, the reason is that I must soon be starting for the office, in order that, by strict application to duty, I may make amends for the past.","Well, since all that is now over and things are gradually returning to how they were before, I will tell you this, little mother: you are worried about what people will think of me, but I hasten to assure you, Varvara Alekseyevna, that my self-esteem is what matters to me before all else. As a consequence of which, and with reference to my misfortunes and all these disorderly events, I beg to inform you that none of my superiors know anything about them, nor are likely to do so, and will therefore all continue to treat me with respect, as before. I am afraid of only one thing: loose tongues. The landlady in our house over here has been shouting her head off, but now that with the help of your ten rubles I have paid off part of my debt to her she merely grumbles, and that is all. As for the others, they turn a blind eye; as long as one doesn’t try to borrow money from them, they don’t care. And to conclude my explanations I shall tell you, little mother, that I value your respect for me more highly than anything else in the world and am consoled by it now in my temporary state of confusion. Thank God that the first impact and the worst of the trouble is now over, and that you have construed it in such a way as not to consider me a false friend and a selfish brute for keeping you here and deceiving you, not having the strength to part with you, and loving you as my little angel. I have set zealously to work now and have begun to discharge my duties well. Yevstafy Ivanovich did not say a word when I walked past him yesterday. I will not conceal from you, little mother, that my debts and the shabby condition of my wardrobe are causing me considerable pain, but that is nothing to worry about, either, and I beseech you not to despair in that regard, little mother. If you will send me another fifty copecks, Varenka, then those fifty copecks too, will pierce my heart. So this is what it has come to now , this is what it has come to! It is not I, old fool that I am, who am helping you, but you, my poor little orphan, who are helping me! Fedora did well to get the money. For the moment I have no hope of getting any, little mother, but as soon as there is hope of my doing so I will write and tell you all about it. But it is loose tongues, loose tongues that worry me most of all. Goodbye, my little angel. I kiss your hand and implore you to get well again. I do not write in more detail because I am in a hurry to get to work, since I wish by dint of zeal and effort to make amends for my dereliction of duty; I shall put off a further account of all that happened to me and of my adventure with the officers until the evening.","Well, as now everything is over and, little by little, things are beginning to be as they used to be, again let me tell you one thing, my good friend: you are worried by what people will think about me, to which I hasten to assure you, Varvara Alexyevna, that my reputation is dearer to me than anything. For which reason and with reference to my misfortunes and all those disorderly proceedings I beg to inform you that no one of the authorities at the office know anything about it or will know anything about it. So that they will all feel the same respect for me as before. The one thing I’m afraid of is gossip. At home our landlady did nothing but shout, and now that with the help of your ten roubles I have paid part of what I owe her she does nothing more than grumble; as for other people, they don’t matter, one mustn’t borrow money of them, that’s all, and to conclude my explanations I tell you, Varvara Alexyevna, that your respect for me I esteem more highly than anything on earth, and I am comforted by it now in my temporary troubles. Thank God that the first blow and the first shock are over and that you have taken it as you have, and don’t look on me as a false friend, or an egoist for keeping you here and deceiving you because I love you as my angel and could not bring myself to part from you. I’ve set to work again assiduously and have begun performing my duties well. Yevstafy Ivanovitch did just say a word when I passed him by yesterday. I will not conceal from you, Varinka, that I am overwhelmed by my debts and the awful condition of my wardrobe, but that again does not matter, and about that too , I entreat you, do not despair, my dear. Send me another half rouble. Varinka, that half rouble rends my heart too. So that’s what it has come to now, that is how it is, old fool that I am; it’s not I helping you, my angel, but you, my poor little orphan, helping me. Fedora did well to get the money. For the time I have no hopes of getting any, but if there should be any prospects I will write to you fully about it all. But gossip, gossip is what I am most uneasy about. I kiss your little hand and implore you to get well. I don’t write more fully because I am in haste to get to the office. For I want by industry and assiduity to atone for all my shortcomings in the way of negligence in the office; a further account of all that happened and my adventures with the officers I put off till this evening."
"Вы мне прислали белья в подарок; но послушайте, Макар Алексеевич, ведь вы разоряетесь. Шутка ли, сколько вы на меня истратили, – ужас сколько денег! Ах, как же вы любите мотать! Мне не нужно; все это было совершенно лишнее. Я знаю, я уверена, что вы меня любите; право, лишнее напоминать мне это подарками; а мне тяжело их принимать от вас; я знаю, чего они вам стоят. Единожды навсегда – полноте; слышите ли? Прошу вас, умоляю вас. Просите вы меня, Макар Алексеевич, прислать продолжение записок моих; желаете, чтоб я их докончила. Я не знаю, как написалось у меня и то, что у меня написано! Но у меня сил недостанет говорить теперь о моем прошедшем; я и думать об нем не желаю; мне страшно становится от этих воспоминаний. Говорить же о бедной моей матушке, оставившей свое бедное дитя в добычу этим чудовищам, мне тяжелее всего. У меня сердце кровью обливается при одном воспоминании. Все это еще так свежо; я не успела одуматься, не только успокоиться, хотя всему этому уже с лишком год. Но вы знаете все.","You sent me linen as a gift; but listen, Makar Alekseevich, you are going bankrupt. It's no joke, how much you spent on me - the horror of how much money! Oh, how you love to wind! I don't need; it was all completely superfluous. I know, I'm sure that you love me; right, it is superfluous to remind me of this with gifts; but it is hard for me to accept them from you; I know what they cost you. Once forever - fullness; do you hear? I beg you, I beg you. Ask me, Makar Alekseevich, to send me a continuation of my notes; you want me to finish them. I do not know how I wrote and what I have written! But I don't have the strength to talk now about my past; I don't even want to think about him; I'm scared of these memories. To speak of my poor mother, who left her poor child as a prey to these monsters, is the hardest thing for me. My heart bleeds at the very memory. All this is still so fresh; I did not have time to change my mind, not only to calm down, although all this has already been over a year old. But you know everything.","You have sent me some linen as a gift. But listen to me, Makar Alexievitch. You are simply ruining yourself. Is it a jest that you should spend so much money, such a terrible amount of money, upon me? How you love to play the spendthrift! I tell you that I do not need it, that such expenditure is unnecessary. I know, I am CERTAIN, that you love me —therefore, it is useless to remind me of the fact with gifts. Nor do I like receiving them, since I know how much they must have cost you. No—put your money to a better use. I beg, I beseech of you, to do so. Also, you ask me to send you a continuation of my memoirs—to conclude them. But I know not how I contrived even to write as much of them as I did; and now I have not the strength to write further of my past, nor the desire to give it a single thought. Such recollections are terrible to me. Most difficult of all is it for me to speak of my poor mother, who left her destitute daughter a prey to villains. My heart runs blood whenever I think of it; it is so fresh in my memory that I cannot dismiss it from my thoughts, nor rest for its insistence, although a year has now elapsed since the events took place. But all this you know.","You have sent me a gift of some linen; but listen, Makar Alekseyevich, you are ruining yourself. I mean, it’s no joke, what you have spent on me – a fearful amount of money!

I know that you love me, I am convinced of it; truly, it is superfluous to remind me of it with gifts, gifts which it is painful for me to accept from you, since I know how much they cost you. Once and for all – desist, do you hear? I beg you, I implore you. Makar Alekseyevich, you ask me to send you the continuation of my notes; you want me to finish them. I do not even know how I managed to write what I did! But I have not the strength now to talk about my past; I don’t even want to think about it; I grow frightened by all those memories. Talking about my poor mother, who left her poor child in the clutches of those monsters is most painful of all to me. My heart bleeds at the mere recollection. All that is still so fresh in my memory; I have not had time to reflect, still less to compose myself, even though it all happened more than a year ago. But you know all about it.","You sent me some linen as a present; but upon my word, Makar Alexyevitch, you are ruining yourself.

But you know all that."
"Милостивая государыня, Варвара Алексеевна!","Gracious Empress, Varvara Alekseevna!","MY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,—I have to tell you that a sad event has happened in this house—an event to excite one’s utmost pity.","Varvara Alekseyevna, Madam,","DEAR MADAM, VARVARA ALEXYEVNA,"

"А дома у нас по целым дням была страшная тоска и скука. Родных и близких знакомых у нас почти не было. С Анной Федоровной батюшка был в ссоре. (Он был ей что-то должен). Ходили к нам довольно часто люди по делам. Обыкновенно спорили, шумели, кричали. После каждого посещения батюшка делался таким недовольным, сердитым: по целым часам ходит, бывало, из угла в угол, нахмурясь, и ни с кем слова не вымолвит. Матушка не смела тогда и заговорить с ним и молчала. Я садилась куда-нибудь в уголок за книжку – смирно, тихо, пошевелиться, бывало, не смею.","And at home we had terrible melancholy and boredom for whole days. We had almost no relatives and close friends. The father was in a quarrel with Anna Fedorovna. (He owed her something). People used to come to us quite often on business. Usually they argued, made noise, shouted. After each visit, the priest became so dissatisfied, angry: for whole hours he walked, it happened, from corner to corner, frowning, and would not utter a word with anyone. Mother did not dare then to speak to him and was silent. I sat down somewhere in a corner for a book - quietly, quietly, I used to not dare to move.","Then there ensued days when dullness and depression reigned supreme. Scarcely a relative or an acquaintance did we possess in St. Petersburg, and even Anna Thedorovna and my father had come to loggerheads with one another, owing to the fact that he owed her money. In fact, our only visitors were business callers, and as a rule these came but to wrangle, to argue, and to raise a disturbance. Such visits would make my father look very discontented, and seem out of temper. For hours and hours he would pace the room with a frown on his face and a brooding silence on his lips. Even my mother did not dare address him at these times, while, for my own part, I used to sit reading quietly and humbly in a corner—not venturing to make a movement of any sort.","In our home a terrible sense of depression and tedium would reign for whole days on end. We had practically no relatives or close acquaintances. Father was on bad terms with Anna Fyodorovna. (He owed her a certain amount of money.) People did come to see us quite frequently on business, but they usually spent the time arguing, making a fuss and shouting. After each visit Father would become so ill-pleased and angry; I can remember that he used to pace the floor hour after hour, frowning, and never exchanging a word with anyone. At such times Mother did not dare to speak to him, and she kept silent. I would sit down somewhere in a corner with a book, as quiet as a mouse, not daring to make the slightest movement.","And for whole days together it was terribly miserable and dreary at home. We had scarcely a relation or intimate acquaintance. Father was not on friendly terms with Anna Fyodorovna. (He was in her debt.) People came on business to us pretty often. Usually they quarrelled, shouted and made an uproar. After every visit father was ill-humoured and cross; he would walk up and down the room by the hour together, frowning and not saying a word to anyone. Mother was silent then and did not dare to speak to him. I used to sit in a corner over a book, still and quiet, not daring to stir."
"Ну, а какова наша придумочка насчет занавески вашей, Варенька? Премило, не правда ли? Сижу ли за работой, ложусь ли спать, просыпаюсь ли, уж знаю, что и вы там обо мне думаете, меня помните, да и сами-то здоровы и веселы. Опустите занавеску – значит, прощайте, Макар Алексеевич, спать пора! Подымете – значит, с добрым утром, Макар Алексеевич, каково-то вы спали, или: каково-то вы в вашем здоровье, Макар Алексеевич? Что же до меня касается, то я, слава творцу, здорова и благополучна! Видите ли, душечка моя, как это ловко придумано; и писем не нужно! Хитро, не правда ли? А ведь придумочка-то моя! А что, каков я на эти дела, Варвара Алексеевна?","Well, what is our idea about your curtain, Varenka? It's nice, isn't it? Whether I sit at work, whether I go to bed, whether I wake up, I already know what you think about me there, remember me, and you yourself are healthy and cheerful. Lower the curtain - so goodbye, Makar Alekseevich, it's time to sleep! Raise - that means good morning, Makar Alekseevich, how did you sleep, or: how are you in your health, Makar Alekseevich? As for me, thank the Creator, I am healthy and prosperous! You see, my dear, how cleverly it is thought up; and letters are not needed! Cheeky, isn't it? But it's my idea! And what, what kind of business am I, Varvara Alekseevna?","But what think you of the plan of the curtain, Barbara? It is a charming one, is it not? No matter whether I be at work, or about to retire to rest, or just awaking from sleep, it enables me to know that you are thinking of me, and remembering me—that you are both well and happy. Then when you lower the curtain, it means that it is time that I, Makar Alexievitch, should go to bed; and when again you raise the curtain, it means that you are saying to me, “Good morning,” and asking me how I am, and whether I have slept well. “As for myself,” adds the curtain, “I am altogether in good health and spirits, glory be to God!” Yes, my heart’s delight, you see how easy a plan it was to devise, and how much writing it will save us! It is a clever plan, is it not? And it was my own invention, too! Am I not cunning in such matters, Barbara Alexievna?","Well, what do you think of our little arrangement concerning your curtain, Varenka? It’s charming, don’t you think? Whatever I am doing – sitting at work, going to bed or waking up, I know that you are up there thinking about me, remembering me, and are yourself well and in good spirits. If you’ve lowered the curtain, that means: ‘Good night, Makar Alekseyevich, it’s bedtime!’ If you’ve raised it, that means: ‘Good morning, Makar Alekseyevich, did you sleep well?’ or ‘How are you today, Makar Alekseyevich? As for myself, thanks be to the Creator, I am well and happy!’ Do you see, my little darling, what a skilful arrangement this is? You don’t even need to write me letters! It’s clever, isn’t it? And what’s more it was my idea. I’m rather good at these things, Varvara Alekseyevna, don’t you agree?","Come, what do you think of our little plan about your curtain, Varinka? It is delightful, isn’t it? Whether I am sitting at work, or lying down for a nap, or waking up, I know that you are thinking about me over there, you are remembering me and that you are well and cheerf ul. You drop the curtain—it means “Good-bye, Makar Alexyevitch, it’s bedtime!” You draw it up—“Good morning, Makar Alexyevitch, how have you slept or are you quite well, Makar Alexyevitch? As for me, thank God, I am well and all right!” You see, my darling, what a clever idea; there is no need of letters! It’s cunning, isn’t it? And you know it was my idea. What do you say to me now, Varvara Alexyevna?"
"Все совершилось! Выпал мой жребий; не знаю какой, но я воле господа покорна. Завтра мы едем. Прощаюсь с вами в последний раз, бесценный мой, друг мой, благодетель мой, родной мой! Не горюйте обо мне, живите счастливо, помните обо мне, и да снизойдет на вас благословение божие! Я буду вспоминать вас часто в мыслях моих, в молитвах моих. Вот и кончилось это время! Я мало отрадного унесу в новую жизнь из воспоминаний прошедшего; тем драгоценнее будет воспоминание об вас, тем драгоценнее будете вы моему сердцу. Вы единственный друг мой; вы только одни здесь любили меня. Ведь я все видела, я ведь знала, как вы любили меня! Улыбкой одной моей вы счастливы были, одной строчкой письма моего. Вам нужно будет теперь отвыкать от меня! Как вы одни здесь останетесь! На кого вы здесь останетесь, добрый, бесценный, единственный друг мой! Оставляю вам книжку, пяльцы, начатое письмо; когда будете смотреть на эти начатые строчки, то мыслями читайте дальше все, что бы хотелось вам услышать или прочесть от меня, все, что я ни написала бы вам; а чего бы я ни написала теперь! Вспоминайте о бедной вашей Вареньке, которая вас так крепко любила. Все ваши письма остались в комоде у Федоры, в верхнем ящике. Вы пишете, что вы больны, а господин Быков меня сегодня никуда не пускает. Я буду вам писать, друг мой, я обещаюсь, но ведь один бог знает, что может случиться. Итак, простимся теперь навсегда, друг мой, голубчик мой, родной мой, навсегда!.. Ох, как бы я теперь обняла вас! Прощайте, мой друг, прощайте, прощайте. Живите счастливо; будьте здоровы. Моя молитва будет вечно об вас. О! как мне грустно, как давит всю мою душу. Господин Быков зовет меня. Вас вечно любящая","Everything is done!

I will take little that is gratifying into the new life from the memories of the past; the more precious will be the memory of you, the more precious will you be to my heart. You are my only friend; You are the only one here who loved me. After all, I saw everything, I knew how much you loved me! You were happy with one smile of mine, one line of my letter. You will need to wean yourself from me now! How do you stay here alone! Who will you stay here for, kind, priceless, my only friend! I leave you a book, a hoop, a letter that I have begun; when you look at these begun lines, then with your thoughts read on everything that you would like to hear or read from me, everything that I would write to you; What would I write now! Remember your poor Varenka, who loved you so dearly. All your letters were left in Fedora's chest of drawers, in the top drawer. You write that you are ill, but Mr. Bykov won't let me go anywhere today. I will write to you, my friend, I promise, but only God knows what might happen. And so, let us say goodbye now forever, my friend, my dear, my dear, forever!.. Oh, how I would embrace you now! Farewell, my friend, farewell, farewell. Live happily; be healthy. My prayer will be forever for you. O! how sad I am, how it crushes my whole soul. Mr. Bykov is calling me. forever loving you","The die is cast! What my lot may have in store I know not, but I am submissive to the will of God. Tomorrow, then, we depart. For the last time, I take my leave of you, my friend beyond price, my benefactor, my dear one! Do not grieve for me, but try to live happily. Think of me sometimes, and may the blessing of Almighty God light upon you! For myself, I shall often have you in remembrance, and recall you in my prayers. Thus our time together has come to an end. Little comfort in my new life shall I derive from memories of the past. The more, therefore, shall I cherish the recollection of you, and the dearer will you ever be to my heart. Here, you have been my only friend; here, you alone have loved me. Yes, I have seen all, I have known all—I have throughout known how well you love me. A single smile of mine, a single stroke from my pen, has been able to make you happy.... But now you must forget me.... How lonely you will be! Why should you stay here at all, kind, inestimable, but solitary, friend of mine? To your care I entrust the book, the embroidery frame, and the letter upon which I had begun. When you look upon the few words which the letter contains you will be able mentally to read in thought all that you would have liked further to hear or receive from me—all that I would so gladly have written, but can never now write. Think sometimes of your poor little Barbara who loved you so well. All your letters I have left behind me in the top drawer of Thedora’s chest of drawers... You write that you are ill, but Monsieur Bwikov will not let me leave the house today; so that I can only write to you. Also, I will write again before long. That is a promise. Yet God only knows when I shall be able to do so.... Now we must bid one another forever farewell, my friend, my beloved, my own! Yes, it must be forever! Ah, how at this moment I could embrace you! Goodbye, dear friend—goodbye, goodbye! May you ever rest well and happy! To the end I shall keep you in my prayers. How my heart is aching under its load of sorrow!... Monsieur Bwikov is just calling for me.... —Your ever loving","It is all done! My lot is cast; I have no knowledge of what it is to be, but I am obedient to the Lord is will. Tomorrow we leave.

Now you will have to learn how to live without me. How will you manage alone here? Who will you have when I am gone, my good, precious, only friend? I am leaving you the book, my lace-frame, the letter I began, did not write; when you look at those lines, you must imagine the words you would like to hear me say or have me write, all the things I would like to write to you; and what would I not write to you now!

"У нас в доме являлся иногда старичок, запачканный, дурно одетый, маленький, седенький, мешковатый, неловкий, одним словом странный донельзя. С первого взгляда на него можно было подумать, что он как будто чего-то стыдится, как будто ему себя самого совестно. Оттого он все как-то ежился, как-то кривлялся; такие ухватки, ужимки были у него, что можно было, почти не ошибаясь, заключить, что он не в своем уме. Придет, бывало, к нам да стоит в сенях у стеклянных дверей и в дом войти не смеет. Кто из нас мимо пройдет – я или Саша, или из слуг, кого он знал подобрее к нему, – то он сейчас машет, манит к себе, делает разные знаки, и разве только когда кивнешь ему головою и позовешь его – условный знак, что в доме нет никого постороннего и что ему можно войти, когда ему угодно, – только тогда старик тихонько отворял дверь, радостно улыбался, потирал руки от удовольствия и на цыпочках прямо отправлялся в комнату Покровского. Это был его отец.","Sometimes an old man appeared in our house, dirty, badly dressed, small, gray-haired, baggy, awkward, in a word, utterly strange. At first glance one might have thought that he seemed to be ashamed of something, as if he were ashamed of himself. That's why he somehow shuddered, somehow grimace; he had such tricks, antics, that one could, almost without mistake, conclude that he was out of his mind. He used to come to us and stand in the passage at the glass doors and dare not enter the house. Whoever of us passes by - I or Sasha, or from the servants whom he knew better to him - then he is now waving, beckoning to himself, making various signs, and only when you nod your head and call him - a conventional sign that there is no stranger in the house and that he can enter whenever he pleases - only then the old man quietly opened the door, smiled joyfully, rubbed his hands with pleasure and tiptoed straight into Pokrovsky's room. It was his father.","Sometimes there came to the house a ragged, poorly-dressed, grey-headed, awkward, amorphous—in short, a very strange-looking—little old man. At first glance it might have been thought that he was perpetually ashamed of something—that he had on his conscience something which always made him, as it were, bristle up and then shrink into himself. Such curious starts and grimaces did he indulge in that one was forced to conclude that he was scarcely in his right mind. On arriving, he would halt for a while by the window in the hall, as though afraid to enter; until, should any one happen to pass in or out of the door—whether Sasha or myself or one of the servants (to the latter he always resorted the most readily, as being the most nearly akin to his own class)—he would begin to gesticulate and to beckon to that person, and to make various signs. Then, should the person in question nod to him, or call him by name (the recognised token that no other visitor was present, and that he might enter freely), he would open the door gently, give a smile of satisfaction as he rubbed his hands together, and proceed on tiptoe to young Pokrovski’s room. This old fellow was none other than Pokrovski’s father.","There sometimes used to appear in our household a little old man, grey-haired, shabbily dressed, mud-bespattered, awkward and clumsy – in short, impossibly strange. From a first glance at him one might have thought he was ashamed of something; he looked as though he had something on his conscience. This made him constantly huddle himself up and make faces to himself in a peculiar sort of way; he had such odd mannerisms and made such strange grimaces that one might, without being very much mistaken, have supposed him to be not in his right mind. He would come to our house and stand in the entrance hall outside the glass doors, not daring to come inside. If he saw one of us going past – Sasha or myself, or one of the servants whom he knew to be kindly disposed towards him – he would immediately start waving, beckoning to himself, and making various signs, and it was only when one nodded to him and called to him – the prearranged signal that there were no visitors in the house and that he might enter whenever he wished to – only then would the old man quietly open the door, smile with delight, rub his hands with satisfaction and proceed straight on tiptoe to Pokrovsky’s room. This was Pokrovsky’s father.","There used sometimes to come to the house a little old man, grey-headed, grubby, badly-dressed, clumsy, awkward, incredibly queer in fact. At the first glance at him one might imagine that he was, as it were, abashed by something—as it were, ashamed of himself. That is why he always seemed to be shrinking into himself, to be, as it were, cowering; he had such queer tricks and ways that one might almost have concluded he was not in his right mind. He would come to the house and stand at the glass door in the entry without daring to come in. If one of us passed by—Sasha or I or any one of the servants he knew to be rather kind to him—he would begin waving at once, beckoning, making gesticulations, and only when one nodded and called to him—a sign agreed upon that there was no outsider in the house and that he might come in when he liked—only then the old man stealthily opened the door with a smile of glee, and rubbing his hands with satisfaction, walked on tiptoe straight to Pokrovsky’s room. This was Pokrovsky’s father."
"– Видите ли, – объяснился он наконец. – Я, Варвара Алексеевна, балуюсь подчас… то есть я хочу доложить вам, что я почти и все балуюсь и всегда балуюсь… придерживаюсь того, что нехорошо… то есть знаете, этак на дворе такие холода бывают, также иногда неприятности бывают разные, или там как-нибудь грустно сделается, или что-нибудь из нехорошего случится, так я и не удержусь подчас, и забалуюсь, и выпью иногда лишнее. Петруше это очень неприятно. Он, вот видите ли, Варвара Алексеевна, сердится, бранит меня и мне морали разные читает. Так вот бы мне и хотелось теперь самому доказать ему подарком моим, что я исправляюсь и начинаю вести себя хорошо. Что вот я копил, чтобы книжку купить, долго копил, потому что у меня и денег-то почти никогда не бывает, разве, случится, Петруша кое-когда даст. Он это знает. Следовательно, вот он увидит употребление денег моих и узнает, что все это я для него одного делаю.","“You see,” he finally explained. “I, Varvara Alekseevna, sometimes indulge ... that is, I want to report to you that I almost always indulge and always indulge ... I stick to what is not good ... that is, you know, it’s such cold outside, also sometimes there are different troubles, or there somehow it will become sad, or something bad will happen, so I can’t restrain myself sometimes, and I indulge myself, and sometimes I drink too much. Petrusha is very uncomfortable. He, you see, Varvara Alekseevna, gets angry, scolds me and reads different morals to me. So now I would like to prove to him myself with my gift that I am improving and beginning to behave well. That I saved up to buy a book, I saved up for a long time, because I almost never have any money, unless, it happens, Petrusha will give it sometime. He knows it. Therefore, he will see the use of my money and will know that I am doing all this for him alone.","“You see,” he went on, “I play the fool too much. I am forever playing the fool, and cannot help myself, though I know that it is wrong to do so. At home it is often cold, and sometimes there are other troubles as well, and it all makes me depressed. Well, whenever that happens, I indulge a little, and occasionally drink too much. Now, Petinka does not like that; he loses his temper about it, Barbara Alexievna, and scolds me, and reads me lectures. So I want by my gift to show him that I am mending my ways, and beginning to conduct myself better. For a long time past, I have been saving up to buy him a book—yes, for a long time past I have been saving up for it, since it is seldom that I have any money, unless Petinka happens to give me some. He knows that, and, consequently, as soon as ever he perceives the use to which I have put his money, he will understand that it is for his sake alone that I have acted.”","‘It’s like this, you see,’ he explained finally. ‘I sometimes indulge myself, Varvara Alekseyevna… that’s to say, I have to inform you that I am constantly induling, practically always indulging myself… I follow practices that are unhealthy… that’s to say, you know how cold it can get out on the streets, and sometimes, too, there are various troubles that come along, or something unpleasant happens, and sometimes I can’t help it , I indulge myself and sometimes drink too much. Petenka doesn’t like that at all. You see, Varvara Alekseyevna, he loses his temper, shouts nasty things at me and gives me lectures on how I ought to behave. So you see I want to show him by means of my present that I’m mending my ways and starting to behave decently. It’s taken me a long time to save up this money to buy a book, because I hardly ever get any money except for what Petenka gives me sometimes. He knows that. Consequently, when he sees the use to which I have put my money, he will realize that I have done it for him alone.’","“You see,” he explained at last, “Varvara Alexyevna, I indulge at times ... that is, I want to tell you that I am almost always indulging, constantly indulging ... I have a habit which is very bad . . . that is, you know, it’s apt to be so cold outdoors and at times there are unpleasantnesses of all sorts, or something makes one sad, or something happens amiss and then I give way at once and begin to indulge and sometimes drink too much. Petrusha dislikes that very much. He gets angry with me, do you see, Varvara Alexyevna, scolds me and gives me lectures, so that I should have liked now to show him by my present that I am reforming and beginning to behave properly, that here I’ve saved up to buy the book, saved up for ever so long, for I scarcely ever have any money except it may happen Petrusha gives me something. He knows that. So here he will see how I have used my money and will know that I have done all that only for him.”"
"Сегодня я двоюродную сестру мою Сашу встретила! Ужас! и она погибнет, бедная! Услышала я тоже со стороны, что Анна Федоровна все обо мне выведывает. Она, кажется, никогда не перестанет меня преследовать. Она говорит, что хочет простить меня, забыть все прошедшее и что непременно сама навестит меня. Говорит, что вы мне вовсе не родственник, что она ближе мне родственница, что в семейные отношения наши вы не имеете никакого права входить и что мне стыдно и неприлично жить вашей милостыней и на вашем содержании… говорит, что я забыла ее хлеб-соль, что она меня с матушкой, может быть, от голодной смерти избавила, что она нас поила-кормила и с лишком два с половиною года на нас убыточилась, что она нам сверх всего этого долг простила. И матушку-то она пощадить не хотела! А если бы знала бедная матушка, что они со мною сделали! Бог видит!.. Анна Федоровна говорит, что я по глупости моей своего счастия удержать не умела, что она сама меня на счастие наводила, что она ни в чем остальном не виновата и что я сама за честь свою не умела, а может быть, и не хотела вступиться. А кто же тут виноват, боже великий! Она говорит, что господин Быков прав совершенно и что не на всякой же жениться, которая… да что писать! Жестоко слышать такую неправду, Макар Алексеевич! Я не знаю, что со мной теперь делается. Я дрожу, плачу, рыдаю; это письмо я вам два часа писала. Я думала, что она по крайней мере сознает свою вину предо мною; а она вот как теперь! Ради бога, не тревожьтесь, друг мой, единственный доброжелатель мой! Федора все преувеличивает: я не больна. Я только простудилась немного вчера, когда ходила на Волково к матушке панихиду служить. Зачем вы не пошли вместе со мною; я вас так просила. Ах, бедная, бедная моя матушка, если бы ты встала из гроба, если б ты знала, если б ты видела, что они со мною сделали!..","Today I met my cousin Sasha! Horror! and she will die, poor thing! I also heard from the outside that Anna Fyodorovna found out everything about me. She never seems to stop haunting me. She says that she wants to forgive me, to forget everything that has happened, and that she will certainly visit me herself. She says that you are not my relative at all, that she is a closer relative to me, that you have no right to enter into our family relations, and that it is shameful and indecent for me to live on your alms and on your maintenance ... says that I forgot her bread and salt, that she, perhaps, saved me and my mother from starvation, that she gave us water and food, and for more than two and a half years she lost money on us, that she forgave us a debt above all this. And she did not want to spare her mother! And if poor mother knew what they did to me! God sees! Anna Fedorovna says that, due to my stupidity, I was not able to keep my happiness, that she herself led me to happiness, that she was not to blame for anything else, and that I myself did not know how to honor my own, or maybe and didn't want to join. And who is to blame here, great God! She says that Mr. Bykov is absolutely right and that one cannot marry anyone who ... but what to write! It's cruel to hear such a lie, Makar Alekseevich! I don't know what is happening to me now. I tremble, cry, sob; I wrote this letter to you for two hours. I thought that she at least recognized her guilt before me; and she's like this now! For God's sake, don't worry, my friend, my only well-wisher! Fedora exaggerates everything: I'm not sick. I just caught a little cold yesterday when I went to Volkovo to serve matushka for a memorial service. Why didn't you go along with me; I asked you so. Oh, my poor, poor mother, if only you would rise from the grave, if you only knew, if you saw what they did to me!...","I met my cousin Sasha. To see her going to wrack and ruin shocked me terribly. Moreover, it has reached me, through a side wind, that she has been making inquiry for me, and dogging my footsteps, under the pretext that she wishes to pardon me, to forget the past, and to renew our acquaintance. Well, among other things she told me that, whereas you are not a kinsman of mine, that she is my nearest relative; that you have no right whatever to enter into family relations with us; and that it is wrong and shameful for me to be living upon your earnings and charity. Also, she said that I must have forgotten all that she did for me, though thereby she saved both myself and my mother from starvation, and gave us food and drink; that for two and a half years we caused her great loss; and, above all things, that she excused us what we owed her. Even my poor mother she did not spare. Would that she, my dead parent, could know how I am being treated! But God knows all about it.... Also, Anna declared that it was solely through my own fault that my fortunes declined after she had bettered them; that she is in no way responsible for what then happened; and that I have but myself to blame for having been either unable or unwilling to defend my honour. Great God! WHO, then, has been at fault? According to Anna, Hospodin [Mr.] Bwikov was only right when he declined to marry a woman who—But need I say it? It is cruel to hear such lies as hers. What is to become of me I do not know. I tremble and sob and weep. Indeed, even to write this letter has cost me two hours. At least it might have been thought that Anna would have confessed HER share in the past. Yet see what she says!... For the love of God do not be anxious about me, my friend, my only benefactor. Thedora is over apt to exaggerate matters. I am not REALLY ill. I have merely caught a little cold. I caught it last night while I was walking to Bolkovo, to hear Mass sung for my mother. Ah, mother, my poor mother! Could you but rise from the grave and learn what is being done to your daughter!","Today I met my cousin Sasha! What a terrible thing to happen! She too will be ruined, poor woman! I also heard from the certain quarter that Anna Fyodorovna is still making enquiries about me. I do not think she will ever stop trying to make my life a misery. She says she wants to forgive me, to forget all that has been, and that she will come to visit me. She says that your are no relation to me at all, that she is a closer relation, that you have no right to enter into our family affairs and that I ought to be ashamed and embarrassed to live on your charity and your salary … she says I have forgotten her hospitality, that she probably saved mother and me from death by starvation, that she fed us and looked after us and was out of pocket on our account for more than two-and-a-half years, that in addition to all that she agreed to overlook a debt we owed her. And she hadn’t a good word to say for mother! Oh, if poor mother only knew what they have done to me! God sees it!… Anna Fyodorovna says I was too stupid to and on to my luck, that she took me down the right path, that she is not to blame for any of the other things that have happened and that it was I who was either unable or, possibly, unwilling to stand up for my own honour. But who was to blame for that, Great God in Heaven? She says that Mr Bykov was entirely in the right, and that a man doesn’t simply go and marry the first woman who… but why should I write about that? It is cruel to hear such slanders, Makar Alekseyevich! I do not know what is happening to me right now. I am trembling, weeping, sobbing; it has taken me two hours to write you this letter. I thought that at least she would admit her guilt in my regard; and look how she is behaving now! For God’s sake, don’t worry, my friend, my only well-wisher! Fedora exaggerates everything: I am not ill. I simply caught a slight cold yesterday when I went to Volkovo for mother’s funeral. Why did you not come with me? I told you that I wanted you to, so badly. Oh, my poor, poor mother, if only you were able to rise from your coffin, if only you knew, if only you could see what they have done to me!…","I met my cousin Sasha to-day! It is horrible! She will be ruined too, poor thing! I heard, too, from other sources that Anna Fyodorovna is still making inquiries about me. It seems as though she will never leave off persecuting me. She says that she wants to forgive me, to forget all the past and that she must come and see me. She says that you are no relation to me at all, that she is a nearer relation, that you have no right to meddle in our family affairs and that it is shameful and shocking to live on your charity and at your expense.... She says that I have forgotten her hospitality, that she saved mother and me from starving to death, perhaps, that she gave us food and drink, and for more than a year and a half was put to expense on our account, and that besides all that she forgave us a debt. Even mother she will not spare! and if only poor mother knew how they have treated me! God sees it! ... Anna Fyodorovna says that I was so silly that I did not know how to take advantage of my luck, that she put me in the way of good luck, that she is not to blame for anything else, and that I myself was not able or perhaps was not anxious to defend my own honour. Who was to blame in that, great God! She says that Mr. Bykov was perfectly right and that he would not marry just anybody who ... but why write it! It is cruel to hear such falsehoods, Makar Alexyevitch! I can’t tell you what a state I am in now. I am trembling, crying, sobbing. I have been two hours over writing this letter to you. I thought that at least she recognised how wrongly she had treated me; and you see what she is now! For God’s sake don’t be alarmed, my friend, the one friend who wishes me well! Fedora exaggerates everything, I am not ill. I only caught cold a little yesterday when I went to the requiem service for mother at Volkovo. Why did you not come with me? I begged you so much to do so. Ah, my poor, poor mother, if she could rise from the grave, if she could see how they have treated me!"
"Маточка! Я теперь в душевном расстройстве ужасном, в волнении ужасном! Мое сердце бьется, хочет из груди выпрыгнуть. И я сам как-то весь как будто ослаб.

"На другой день старик пришел к сыну, с часочек посидел у него по обыкновению, потом зашел к нам и подсел ко мне с прекомическим таинственным видом. Сначала с улыбкой, потирая руки от гордого удовольствия владеть какой-нибудь тайной, он объявил мне, что книжки все пренезаметно перенесены к нам и стоят в уголку, в кухне, под покровительством Матрены. Потом разговор естественно перешел на ожидаемый праздник; потом старик распространился о том, как мы будем дарить, и чем далее углублялся он в свой предмет, чем более о нем говорил, тем приметнее мне становилось, что у него есть что-то на душе, о чем он не может, не смеет, даже боится выразиться. Я все ждала и молчала. Тайная радость, тайное удовольствие, что я легко читала доселе в его странных ухватках, гримасничанье, подмигиванье левым глазком, исчезли. Он делался поминутно все беспокойнее и тоскливее; наконец он не выдержал.","The next day the old man came to his son, sat with him for an hour as usual, then came to us and sat down beside me with a comically mysterious air. At first, with a smile, rubbing his hands from the proud pleasure of owning some secret, he announced to me that all the books had been imperceptibly transferred to us and were standing in a corner, in the kitchen, under the protection of Matryona. Then the conversation naturally turned to the expected holiday; then the old man spread about how we would give gifts, and the further he went into his subject, the more he talked about it, the more noticeable it became to me that he had something in his soul that he could not, did not dare, even afraid to express himself. I kept waiting and was silent. The secret joy, the secret pleasure that I had easily read until now in his strange ways, the grimacing, the winking of his left eye, disappeared. Every minute he became more and more restless and melancholy; finally he couldn't take it anymore.","Next day the old man came to see his son, and sat with him, as usual, for about an hour; after which he visited ourselves, wearing on his face the most comical, the most mysterious expression conceivable. Smiling broadly with satisfaction at the thought that he was the possessor of a secret, he informed me that he had stealthily brought the books to our rooms, and hidden them in a corner of the kitchen, under Matrena’s care. Next, by a natural transition, the conversation passed to the coming fête-day; whereupon, the old man proceeded to hold forth extensively on the subject of gifts. The further he delved into his thesis, and the more he expounded it, the clearer could I see that on his mind there was something which he could not, dared not, divulge. So I waited and kept silent. The mysterious exaltation, the repressed satisfaction which I had hitherto discerned in his antics and grimaces and left-eyed winks gradually disappeared, and he began to grow momentarily more anxious and uneasy. At length he could contain himself no longer.","On the following afternoon the old man came to visit his son, sat with him for an hour or so as he usually did, then looked in to see us and sat down beside me with a most comical enigmatic expression. First, with a smile, and rubbing his hands with proud satisfaction at being in possession of a confidentiality, he told me that all the books had been brought to us in the greatest secrecy and were being kept in a corner of the kitchen under Matryona is supervision. Then the conversation naturally turned to the day we were waiting for; the old man talked for some time about how we would present the gift, and the more deeply he became engrossed in his subject, the more obvious it became to me that he had something on his mind, something he was unable, did not dare, was even afraid to talk about. I bided my time and remained silent. The secret joy, the secret satisfaction which I had had no difficulty in reading from his strange mannerisms, his grimaces, his winking of his left eye, had vanished. From moment to moment he was becoming more and more restless and uneasy; finally he could restrain himself no longer.","Next day the old man came to see his son, spent about an hour with him as usual, then came in to us and sat down beside me with a very comical mysterious air.

I waited and said nothing. The secret joy, the secret satisfaction which I had readily discerned at first in his strange gestures and grimaces and the winking of his left eye, disappeared.

"Ax, Макар Алексеевич! Что вы там ни говорите, как ни рассчитывайте свои доходы, чтоб обмануть меня, чтобы показать, что они все сплошь идут на вас одного, но от меня не утаите и не скроете ничего. Ясно, что вы необходимого лишаетесь из-за меня. Что это вам вздумалось, например, такую квартиру нанять? Ведь вас беспокоят, тревожат; вам тесно, неудобно. Вы любите уединение, а тут и чего-чего нет около вас! А вы бы могли гораздо лучше жить, судя по жалованью вашему. Федора говорит, что вы прежде и не в пример лучше теперешнего жили. Неужели ж вы так всю свою жизнь прожили, в одиночестве, в лишениях, без радости, без дружеского приветливого слова, у чужих людей углы нанимая? Ах, добрый друг, как мне жаль вас! Щадите хоть здоровье свое, Макар Алексеевич! Вы говорите, что у вас глаза слабеют, так не пишите при свечах; зачем писать? Ваша ревность к службе и без того, вероятно, известна начальникам вашим.","Ah, Makar Alekseevich! Whatever you say there, no matter how you calculate your income in order to deceive me, to show that they all go to you alone, but you will not conceal or hide anything from me. It is clear that you are deprived of what you need because of me. What did you think of, for example, to rent such an apartment? After all, you are worried, disturbed; you are cramped, uncomfortable. You love solitude, and here there is something that is not around you! And you could live much better, judging by your salary. Fedora says that you lived better before and unlike now. Have you really lived your whole life like this, alone, in deprivation, without joy, without a friendly friendly word, hiring corners from strangers? Ah, good friend, how I pity you! Spare at least your health, Makar Alekseevich! You say that your eyes are weakening, so do not write by candlelight; why write? Your zeal for service is probably already known to your superiors.","There now! Ah, Makar Alexievitch, you neither speak of nor give any account of what you have spent upon me. You hope thereby to deceive me, to make it seem as though the cost always falls upon you alone, and that there is nothing to conceal. Yet I KNOW that for my sake you deny yourself necessaries. For instance, what has made you go and take the room which you have done, where you will be worried and disturbed, and where you have neither elbow-space nor comfort—you who love solitude, and never like to have any one near you? To judge from your salary, I should think that you might well live in greater ease than that. Also, Thedora tells me that your circumstances used to be much more affluent than they are at present. Do you wish, then, to persuade me that your whole existence has been passed in loneliness and want and gloom, with never a cheering word to help you, nor a seat in a friend’s chimney-corner? Ah, kind comrade, how my heart aches for you! But do not overtask your health, Makar Alexievitch. For instance, you say that your eyes are over-weak for you to go on writing in your office by candle-light. Then why do so? I am sure that your official superiors do not need to be convinced of your diligence!","Oh, Makar Alekseyevich! Whatever you say, however much you calculate your profits in order to deceive me, in order to prove that they are all spent on you alone, you will not deceive me and will not succeed in concealing anything from me. You are obviously depriving yourself of necessities for my sake. Whatever were you thinking of, for example, when you rented such a room? I mean, others are disturbing you, harrassing you; you’re cramped and uncomfortable. You like seclusion, yet here you have heaven knows what all around you! Yet you could live much better than this, judging by your salary. Fedora says the way you used to live was better by far. Have you really spent all your life like this, in solitude, in hardship and joylessness, without a friendly word, renting corners from strangers? Oh, my good friend, how sorry I am for you! At least look after yourself, Makar Alekseyevich! You say that your eyes are growing weak – then do not write by candlelight; why write? I am sure that your devotion to your duty is already well known to your superiors.","Ah, Makar Alexyevitch! Whatever you may say, however you may reckon over your income to deceive me, to prove that your money is all spent on yourself, you won’t take me in and you won’t hide anything from me. It is clear that you are depriving yourself of necessities for my sake. What possessed you, for instance, to take such a lodging? Why, you will be disturbed and worried; you are cramped for room, uncomfortable. You love solitude, and here, goodness knows what you have all about you! You might live a great deal better, judging from your salary. Fedora says you used to live ever so much better than you do now. Can you have spent all your life like this in solitude, in privation, without pleasure, without a friendly affectionate word, a lodger among strangers? Ah, dear friend, how sorry I am for you! Take care of your health, anyway, Makar Alexyevitch! You say your eyes are weak; so you must not write by candlelight; why write? Your devotion to your work must be known to your superiors without that."

"Я почти не оставляла его комнаты во все продолжение его болезни, ухаживала за ним и прислуживала ему. Часто не спала целые ночи. Он редко был в памяти; часто был в бреду; говорил бог знает о чем: о своем месте, о своих книгах, обо мне, об отце… и тут-то я услышала многое из его обстоятельств, чего прежде не знала и о чем даже не догадывалась. В первое время болезни его все наши смотрели на меня как-то странно; Анна Федоровна качала головою. Но я посмотрела всем прямо в глаза, и за участие мое к Покровскому меня не стали осуждать более – по крайней мере матушка.","I almost did not leave his room during the entire duration of his illness, I looked after him and served him. Often did not sleep for whole nights. He was rarely remembered; was often delirious; God knows what he was talking about: about his place, about his books, about me, about his father ... and then I heard many of his circumstances, which I did not know before and which I did not even guess about. During the first period of his illness, all of us looked at me in a strange way; Anna Fyodorovna shook her head. But I looked everyone straight in the eye, and for my participation in Pokrovsky they did not condemn me any more - at least mother.","Throughout his illness I scarcely ever left his room, but waited on him hand and foot. Often he could not sleep for several nights at a time. Often, too, he was unconscious, or else in a delirium; and at such times he would talk of all sorts of things—of his work, of his books, of his father, of myself. At such times I learned much which I had not hitherto known or divined about his affairs. During the early part of his illness everyone in the house looked askance at me, and Anna Thedorovna would nod her head in a meaning manner; but, I always looked them straight in the face, and gradually they ceased to take any notice of my concern for Pokrovski. At all events my mother ceased to trouble her head about it.","I practically never left his room throughout the entire duration of his illness, looking after him and nursing him. I frequently did not sleep for whole nights on end. He was seldom in possession of his faculties; frequently he would be in delirium; he would talk about God knows what ; his job, his books, about me, about his father… at this time, too, I heard much about his circumstances which previously I had not known and had not even guessed. During the early period of his illness everyone used to give me rather strange looks; Anna Fyodorovna would shake her head. But I used to look everyone straight in the eye, and they stopped frowning upon my concern for Pokrovsky – or at least Mother did.","I scarcely left his room during the whole time of his illness, I nursed him and looked after him. Often I did not sleep for nights together. He was frequently delirious and rarely quite himself; he talked of goodness knows what, of his post, of his books, of me, of his father ... and it was then I heard a great deal about his circumstances of which I had not known or even guessed before. When first he was ill, all of them looked at me somehow strangely; Anna Fyodorovna shook her head. But I looked them all straight in the face and they did not blame me any more for my sympathy for Pokrovsky—at least my mother did not."

"К моему счастию, я нашла весьма скоро Пушкина, и в весьма красивом переплете. Я начала торговаться. Сначала запросили дороже, чем в лавках; но потом, впрочем не без труда, уходя несколько раз, я довела купца до того, что он сбавил цену и ограничил свои требования только десятью рублями серебром. Как мне весело было торговаться!.. Бедная Матрена не понимала, что со мной делается и зачем я вздумала покупать столько книг. Но ужас! Весь мой капитал был в тридцать рублей ассигнациями, а купец никак не соглашался уступить дешевле. Наконец я начала упрашивать, просила-просила его, наконец упросила. Он уступил, но только два с полтиною, и побожился, что и эту уступку он только ради меня делает, что я такая барышня хорошая, а что для другого кого он ни за что бы не уступил. Двух с половиною рублей недоставало! Я готова была заплакать с досады. Но самое неожиданное обстоятельство помогло мне в моем горе.","Fortunately for me, I found Pushkin very soon, and in a very beautiful binding. I started trading. At first they asked for more than in the shops; but then, however, not without difficulty, leaving several times, I brought the merchant to the point that he lowered the price and limited his demands to only ten silver rubles. How fun it was for me to bargain! Poor Matryona did not understand what was happening to me and why I decided to buy so many books. But horror! All my capital was thirty rubles in banknotes, and the merchant did not agree to give way cheaper. Finally, I began to beg, asked, asked him, finally begged. He conceded, but only two and a half, and swore that he was making this concession only for my sake, that I was such a good young lady, and that he would never have conceded for anyone else. Two and a half rubles were missing! I was ready to cry in frustration. But the most unexpected circumstance helped me in my grief.","Luckily, I soon chanced upon a set of Pushkin, handsomely bound, and set myself to bargain for it. At first more was demanded than would have been asked of me in a shop; but afterwards—though not without a great deal of trouble on my part, and several feints at departing—I induced the dealer to lower his price, and to limit his demands to ten roubles in silver. How I rejoiced that I had engaged in this bargaining! Poor Matrena could not imagine what had come to me, nor why I so desired to buy books. But, oh horror of horrors! As soon as ever the dealer caught sight of my capital of thirty roubles in notes, he refused to let the Pushkin go for less than the sum he had first named; and though, in answer to my prayers and protestations, he eventually yielded a little, he did so only to the tune of two-and-a-half roubles more than I possessed, while swearing that he was making the concession for my sake alone, since I was “a sweet young lady,” and that he would have done so for no one else in the world. To think that only two-and-a-half roubles should still be wanting! I could have wept with vexation. Suddenly an unlooked-for circumstance occurred to help me in my distress.","As luck would have it, I found a complete edition of Pushkin very quickly – it was one in a very nice binding. I began to bargain. At first the stallowner demanded more than was charged in the bookshops; but after a while, though not without difficulty, and walking away several times, I succeeded in persuading him to reduce the price to only ten silver rubles. The bargaining was such fun!… Poor Matryona could not understand what had got into me, and why I wanted to buy so many books. But horror! My entire capital amounted to only thirty paper rubles, and the stallowner would not agree to part with the books more cheaply. Finally I began to implore him, beseech him, and in the end got my way. He yielded, but only by two and a half rubles, and he swore that he was only doing this as a special favour to me, since I was such a nice lady; he would not do it for anyone else. I was short of the necessary amount by two and a half rubles! I could almost have wept with frustration. But in my misery a most unexpected circumstance came to my aid.","I was so fortunate as to find a Pushkin very quickly and one in a very fine binding. I began bargaining. At first they demanded a price higher than that in the bookseller’s shops; but in the end, though not without trouble, and walking away several times, I brought the shopman to knocking down the price and asking no more than ten roubles in silver. How I enjoyed bargaining! ... Poor Matrona could not make out what was the matter with me and what possessed me to buy so many books. But, oh, horror! My whole capital consisted of thirty roubles in paper, and the shopman would not consent to let the books go cheaper. At last I began beseeching him, begged and begged him and at last persuaded him. He gave way but only took off two and a half roubles and swore he only made that concession for my sake because I was such a nice young lady and he would not have done it for anyone else. I still had not enough by two and a half roubles. I was ready to cry with vexation. But the most unexpected circumstance came to my assistance in my distress."

"Потом я узнала подробно всю историю этого бедного старика. Он когда-то где-то служил, был без малейших способностей и занимал самое последнее, самое незначительное место на службе. Когда умерла первая его жена (мать студента Покровского), то он вздумал жениться во второй раз, и женился на мещанке. При новой жене в доме все пошло вверх дном; никому житья от нее не стало; она всех к рукам прибрала. Студент Покровский был тогда еще ребенком, лет десяти. Мачеха его возненавидела. Но маленькому Покровскому благоприятствовала судьба. Помещик Быков, знавший чиновника Покровского и бывший некогда его благодетелем, принял ребенка под свое покровительство и поместил его в какую-то школу. Интересовался же он им потому, что знал его покойную мать, которая еще в девушках была облагодетельствована Анной Федоровной и выдана ею замуж за чиновника Покровского. Господин Быков, друг и короткий знакомый Анны Федоровны, движимый великодушием, дал за невестой пять тысяч рублей приданого. Куда эти деньги пошли – неизвестно. Так мне рассказывала все это Анна Федоровна; сам же студент Покровский никогда не любил говорить о своих семейных обстоятельствах. Говорят, что его мать была очень хороша собою, и мне странно кажется, почему она так неудачно вышла замуж, за такого незначительного человека… Она умерла еще в молодых летах, года четыре спустя после замужества.","Then I learned in detail the whole story of this poor old man. He once served somewhere, was without the slightest ability and occupied the last, most insignificant place in the service. When his first wife died (the mother of the student Pokrovsky), he took it into his head to marry a second time, and married a bourgeois woman. With a new wife in the house, everything went upside down; no one could live from her; she took them all into her own hands. Student Pokrovsky was then still a child, about ten years old. His stepmother hated him. But fate favored little Pokrovsky. The landowner Bykov, who knew the official Pokrovsky and was once his benefactor, took the child under his protection and placed him in some kind of school. He was interested in him because he knew his late mother, who, while still a girl, was favored by Anna Feodorovna and married by her to the official Pokrovsky. Mr. Bykov, a friend and short acquaintance of Anna Fedorovna, moved by generosity, gave five thousand rubles dowry for the bride. Where the money went is unknown. So Anna Fedorovna told me all this; the student Pokrovsky himself never liked to talk about his family circumstances. They say that his mother was very pretty, and it seems strange to me why she married so unsuccessfully, for such an insignificant person ... She died at a young age, four years after her marriage.","Later I came to know his story in detail. Formerly a civil servant, he had possessed no additional means, and so had occupied a very low and insignificant position in the service. Then, after his first wife (mother of the younger Pokrovski) had died, the widower bethought him of marrying a second time, and took to himself a tradesman’s daughter, who soon assumed the reins over everything, and brought the home to rack and ruin, so that the old man was worse off than before. But to the younger Pokrovski, fate proved kinder, for a landowner named Bwikov, who had formerly known the lad’s father and been his benefactor, took the boy under his protection, and sent him to school. Another reason why this Bwikov took an interest in young Pokrovski was that he had known the lad’s dead mother, who, while still a serving-maid, had been befriended by Anna Thedorovna, and subsequently married to the elder Pokrovski. At the wedding Bwikov, actuated by his friendship for Anna, conferred upon the young bride a dowry of five thousand roubles; but whither that money had since disappeared I cannot say. It was from Anna’s lips that I heard the story, for the student Pokrovski was never prone to talk about his family affairs. His mother was said to have been very good-looking; wherefore, it is the more mysterious why she should have made so poor a match. She died when young—only four years after her espousal.","I later discovered most of the details of this poor old man’s story. He had once had a government position somewhere, had no abilities whatsoever and had occupied the lowliest and most insignificant post in the service. On the death of his first wife (the mother of our ‘student’ Pokrovsky), he had taken it into his head to marry a second time, and married a tradesman’s daughter. His new wife turned the household upside down; she would leave no one alone, took everyone in hand. At that time our ‘student’ Pokrovsky was only a child of about ten years old. His stepmother hated him. But fate smiled on little Pokrovsky. The landowner Bykov, who knew the government clerk Pokrovsky and had once been his benefactor, took the child into his care and found him a place in some school or other. He took an interest in the boy because he had known his dead mother, who as a girl had received the good favours of Anna Fyodorovna and had been married by her to the government clerk Pokrovsky. Moved by generosity, Mr Bykov, a friend and intimate acquaintance of Anna Fyodorovna’s, had given the sum of five thousand rubles as a dowry for the bride. Where that money had gone, no one knew. That was the story as Anna Fyodorovna told it to me; the istudent’ Pokrovsky never liked talking about his family circumstances. They say that his mother was very good-looking, and I find it strange that she should have made such a poor marriage to such an insignificant man… She died when she was still quite young, about four years after the marriage.","Later on, I learnt the whole story of this poor old man. He had once been in the service, was entirely without ability, and filled the very lowest and most insignificant post. When his first wife (our Pokrovsky’s mother) died he took it into his head to marry a second time and married a girl of the working-class. Everything was turned topsy-turvy under the rule of his new wife. She let no one live in peace, she domineered over everyone. Our Pokrovsky was still a child, ten years old. His stepmother hated him, but fate was kind to the boy. A country gentleman called Bykov, who had known the elder Pokrovsky and at one time been his patron, took the child under his protection and sent him to school. He was interested in him because he had known his mother, who had been a protegee of Anna Fyodorovna’s and had by her been married to Pokrovsky. Mr. Bykov, a very intimate friend of Anna Fyodorovna’s, had generously given the girl a dowry of five thousand roubles on her marriage. Where that money went to I don’t know. That was the story Anna Fyodorovna told me; young Pokrovsky never liked speaking of his family circumstances. They say his mother was very pretty, and it seems strange to me that she should have been so unfortunately married to such an insignificant man. He was quite young when she died four years after their marriage."

"Макар Алексеевич! что это с вами? Бога вы не боитесь, верно! Вы меня просто с ума сведете. Не стыдно ли вам! Вы себя губите, вы подумайте только о своей репутации! Вы человек честный, благородный, амбиционный – ну, как все узнают про вас! Да вы просто со стыда должны будете умереть! Или не жаль вам седых волос ваших? Ну, боитесь ли вы бога? Федора сказала, что уже теперь не будет вам более помогать, да и я тоже вам денег давать не буду. До чего вы меня довели, Макар Алексеевич! Вы думаете, верно, что мне ничего, что вы так дурно ведете себя; вы еще не знаете, что я из-за вас терплю! Мне по нашей лестнице и пройти нельзя: все на меня смотрят, пальцем на меня указывают и такие страшные вещи говорят; да, прямо говорят, что связалась я с пьяницей. Каково это слышать! Когда вас привозят, то на вас все жильцы с презрением указывают: вот, говорят, того чиновника привезли. А мне-то за вас мочи нет как совестно. Клянусь вам, что я перееду отсюда. Пойду куда-нибудь в горничные, в прачки, а здесь не останусь. Я вам писала, чтоб вы зашли ко мне, а вы не зашли. Знать, вам ничего мои слезы и просьбы, Макар Алексеевич! И откуда вы денег достали? Ради создателя, поберегитесь. Ведь пропадете, ни за что пропадете! И стыд-то и срам-то какой! Вас хозяйка и впустить вчера не хотела, вы в сенях ночевали: я все знаю. Если б вы знали, как мне тяжело было, когда я все это узнала. Приходите ко мне, вам будет у нас весело: мы будем вместе читать, будем старое вспоминать. Федора о своих богомольных странствиях рассказывать будет. Ради меня, голубчик мой, не губите себя и меня не губите. Ведь я для вас одного и живу, для вас и остаюсь с вами. Так-то вы теперь! Будьте благородным человеком, твердым в несчастиях; помните, что бедность не порок. Да и чего отчаиваться: это все временное! Даст бог – все поправится, только вы-то удержитесь теперь. Посылаю вам двугривенный, купите себе табаку или всего, что вам захочется, только ради бога на дурное не тратьте. Приходите к нам, непременно приходите. Вам, может быть, как и прежде, стыдно будет, но вы не стыдитесь: это ложный стыд. Только бы вы искреннее раскаяние принесли. Надейтесь на бога. Он все устроит к лучшему.","Makar Alekseevich! what is it with you? You are not afraid of God, right! You just drive me crazy. Aren't you ashamed! You are ruining yourself, you only think of your reputation! You are an honest, noble, ambitious person - well, how will everyone know about you! Yes, you just have to die of shame! Or do you not feel sorry for your gray hair? Well, are you afraid of God? Fedora said that she wouldn't help you anymore, and I won't give you any money either. What have you brought me to, Makar Alekseevich! You think, right, that I don't care that you behave so badly; You still don't know what I'm suffering because of you! I can’t even walk up our stairs: everyone is looking at me, pointing fingers at me and saying such terrible things; yes, they directly say that I contacted a drunkard. What it's like to hear! When they bring you in, all the tenants point at you with contempt: here, they say, they brought that official. And I have no urine for you as ashamed. I swear to you that I will move from here. I'll go somewhere to be a maid, a laundress, but I won't stay here. I wrote to you to come to me, but you did not come. Know that my tears and requests are nothing to you, Makar Alekseevich! And where did you get the money from? For the sake of the creator, beware. After all, you will be lost, you will be lost for nothing! And what a shame and shame! The hostess didn’t even want to let you in yesterday, you spent the night in the hallway: I know everything. If you knew how hard it was for me when I found out all this. Come to me, you will have fun with us: we will read together, we will remember the old. Fedor will tell about his pious wanderings. For my sake, my dear, do not ruin yourself and do not ruin me. After all, I live for you alone, and for you I remain with you. So you are now! Be a noble man, firm in adversity; remember that poverty is not a vice. And why despair: it's all temporary! God willing, everything will get better, only you can hold on now. I am sending you two kopecks, buy yourself tobacco or whatever you want, but for God's sake don't waste it on bad things. Come to us, be sure to come. You may be ashamed, as before, but you are not ashamed: this is false shame. If only you would bring sincere repentance. Trust in God. He will make everything better.","What is the matter with you, Makar Alexievitch? Surely you cannot fear the Lord God as you ought to do? You are not only driving me to distraction but also ruining yourself with this eternal solicitude for your reputation. You are a man of honour, nobility of character, and self-respect, as everyone knows; yet, at any moment, you are ready to die with shame! Surely you should have more consideration for your grey hairs. No, the fear of God has departed from you. Thedora has told you that it is out of my power to render you anymore help. See, therefore, to what a pass you have brought me! Probably you think it is nothing to me that you should behave so badly; probably you do not realise what you have made me suffer. I dare not set foot on the staircase here, for if I do so I am stared at, and pointed at, and spoken about in the most horrible manner. Yes, it is even said of me that I am “united to a drunkard.” What a thing to hear! And whenever you are brought home drunk folk say, “They are carrying in that tchinovnik.” THAT is not the proper way to make me help you. I swear that I MUST leave this place, and go and get work as a cook or a laundress. It is impossible for me to stay here. Long ago I wrote and asked you to come and see me, yet you have not come. Truly my tears and prayers must mean NOTHING to you, Makar Alexievitch! Whence, too, did you get the money for your debauchery? For the love of God be more careful of yourself, or you will be ruined. How shameful, how abominable of you! So the landlady would not admit you last night, and you spent the night on the doorstep? Oh, I know all about it. Yet if only you could have seen my agony when I heard the news!... Come and see me, Makar Alexievitch, and we will once more be happy together. Yes, we will read together, and talk of old times, and Thedora shall tell you of her pilgrimages in former days. For God’s sake beloved, do not ruin both yourself and me. I live for you alone; it is for your sake alone that I am still here. Be your better self once more—the self which still can remain firm in the face of misfortune. Poverty is no crime; always remember that. After all, why should we despair? Our present difficulties will pass away, and God will right us. Only be brave. I send you two grivenniks for the purchase of some tobacco or anything else that you need; but, for the love of heaven, do not spend the money foolishly. Come you and see me soon; come without fail. Perhaps you may be ashamed to meet me, as you were before, but you NEED not feel like that—such shame would be misplaced. Only do bring with you sincere repentance and trust in God, who orders all things for the best.","Makar Alekseyevich! What has got into you? You must have lost your fear of God! You are simply driving me out of my mind. Are you not ashamed? You will be your own undoing. Just think of your reputation! You are an honest, decent, self-respecting man – well, what will you do when everyone hears of you? You will simply die of shame! Have you no fear of God? Fedora told me that she refuses to help you any more, and I won’t give you any more money, either. What have you brought me to, Makar Alekseyevich? I expect you probably think I don’t care that you behave so badly; you don’t know what I have to endure because of you! I can’t even go up and down our stairs: everyone stares at me and points to me with their fingers, and they say such terrible things; yes, they say quite openly that I’ve taken up with a drunkard. Think what I feel when I hear that! When you are brought back here all the lodgers point at you with contempt: ‘Look,’ they say,’they’ve brought that clerk back again.’ And I can’t endure the shame I feel for you. I swear to you that I will move away from here. I’ll go and work somewhere as a housemaid or a laundrywoman, but I won’t stop here. I wrote asking you to come and visit me, but you never did. My tears and entreaties evidently mean nothing to you, Makar Alekseyevich! And where did you get the money from, in any case? In the Lord’s name, take care! I mean, you will come to ruin , you will come to ruin for nothing! And the shame, the ignominy! The landlady refused to let you in last night, you spent the night in the outhouse: I know everything. If you knew how wretched I felt when I learned of it. Please come and see me, visiting us will cheer you up: we’ll read together, we’ll remember old times. Fedora will tell us about the religious pilgrimages she was on. Please, for my sake, my dear friend, don’t bring about your own undoing and my own. After all, I live for you alone, and it is for your sake that I am remaining with you. And this is how you behave! Be a decent man, steadfast in misfortune; remember that poverty is not a sin. And indeed, what reason is there for despair? It is all just temporary! With God is good will, everything will come right again – only now you must exercise self-control. I send you twenty copecks, buy some tobacco with it or whatever takes your fancy, only don’t, for the love of God, spend it on drink. Come and see us, come and see us without fail. Perhaps you’ll feel ashamed, the way you did last time, but don’t: it is a false shame. Just bring some genuine repentance with you. Trust in God. He will arrange everything for the best.","MAKAR ALEXYEVITCH What is the matter with you? It seems you have no fear of God! You are simply driving me out of my mind. Aren’t you ashamed? You will be your own ruin; you should at least think of your good name! You’re a man of honour, of gentlemanly feelings, of self-respect; well, when everyone finds out about you! Why, you will simply die of shame! Have you no pity for your grey hairs? Have you no fear of God? Fedora says she won’t help you again, and I won’t give you money either. What have you brought me to, Makar Alexyevitch? I suppose you think that it is nothing to me , your behaving so badly?You don’t know what I have to put up with on your account! I can’t even go down our staircase; everyone looks at me and points at me, and says such awful things; they say plainly that I have taken up with a drunkard. Think what it is to hear that! When you are brought in all the lodgers point at you with contempt: “Look,” they say, “they’ve brought that clerk in.” And I’m ready to faint with shame over you. I swear I shall move from here. I shall go somewhere as a housemaid or a laundrymaid, I shan’t stay here. I wrote to you to come and see me here but you did not come. So are my tears and entreaties nothing to you, Makar Alexyevitch? And where do you get the money? For God’s sake, do be careful. Why, you are ruining yourself, ruining yourself for nothing! And it’s a shame and a disgrace! The landlady would not let you in last night, you spent the night in the porch. I know all about it. If only you knew how miserable I was when I knew all about it. Come to see me; you will be happy with us; we will read together; we will recall the past. Fedora will tell us about her wanderings as a pilgrim. For my sake, don’t destroy yourself and me. Why, I only live for you, for your sake I am staying with you. And this is how you are behaving now! Be a fine man, steadfast in misfortune, remember that poverty is not a vice. And why despair? It is all temporary! Please God, it will all be set right, only you must restrain yourself now. I send you twenty kopecks. Buy yourself tobacco or anything you want, only for God’s sake don’t spend it on what’s harmful. Come and see us, be sure to come. Perhaps you will be ashamed as you were before, but don’t be ashamed; it’s false shame. If only you would show genuine penitence. Trust in God. He will do all things for the best."

"С самого раннего утра, Варенька, у нас возня начинается, встают, ходят, стучат, – это поднимаются все, кому надо, кто в службе или так, сам по себе; все пить чай начинают. Самовары у нас хозяйские, большею частию, мало их, ну так мы все очередь держим; а кто попадет не в очередь со своим чайником, так сейчас тому голову вымоют. Вот я было попал в первый раз, да… впрочем, что же писать! Тут-то я со всеми и познакомился. С мичманом с первым познакомился; откровенный такой, все мне рассказал: про батюшку, про матушку, про сестрицу, что за тульским заседателем, и про город Кронштадт. Обещал мне во всем покровительствовать и тут же меня к себе на чай пригласил. Отыскал я его в той самой комнате, где у нас обыкновенно в карты играют. Там мне дали чаю и непременно хотели, чтоб я в азартную игру с ними играл. Смеялись ли они, нет ли надо мною, не знаю; только сами они всю ночь напролет проиграли, и когда я вошел, так тоже играли. Мел, карты, дым такой ходил по всей комнате, что глаза ело. Играть я не стал, и мне сейчас заметили, что я про философию говорю. Потом уж никто со мною и не говорил все время; да я, по правде, рад был тому. Не пойду к ним теперь; азарт у них, чистый азарт! Вот у чиновника по литературной части бывают также собрания по вечерам. Ну, у того хорошо, скромно, невинно и деликатно; все на тонкой ноге.","From the very early morning, Varenka, fuss begins with us, they get up, walk around, knock - it's all who need it, who are in the service or so, on their own; everyone starts drinking tea. We have the master's samovars, for the most part, there are few of them, well, we keep the line all the time; and whoever gets out of line with his teapot, they will wash his head now. Here I was for the first time, yes ... however, what to write! That's where I met everyone. I met the midshipman first; such a frank one, he told me everything: about the father, about the mother, about the sister, about the Tula assessor, and about the city of Kronstadt. He promised to patronize me in everything and immediately invited me to his place for tea. I found him in the same room where we usually play cards. There they gave me tea and certainly wanted me to gamble with them. Whether they laughed, whether they were at me, I do not know; only they themselves played all night long, and when I came in they were playing like that too. Chalk, maps, such smoke walked all over the room that it hurt my eyes. I did not play, and now they noticed that I was talking about philosophy. Then no one spoke to me all the time; Yes, I was really happy about that. I will not go to them now; they have passion, pure passion! Here, the literary official also has meetings in the evenings. Well, that one is good, modest, innocent and delicate; all on a thin leg.","From earliest dawn the house is astir as its inmates rise, walk about, and stamp their feet. That is to say, everyone who has to go to work then gets out of bed. First of all, tea is partaken of. Most of the tea-urns belong to the landlady; and since there are not very many of them, we have to wait our turn. Anyone who fails to do so will find his teapot emptied and put away. On the first occasion, that was what happened to myself. Well, is there anything else to tell you? Already I have made the acquaintance of the company here. The naval officer took the initiative in calling upon me, and his frankness was such that he told me all about his father, his mother, his sister (who is married to a lawyer of Tula), and the town of Kronstadt. Also, he promised me his patronage, and asked me to come and take tea with him. I kept the appointment in a room where card-playing is continually in progress; and, after tea had been drunk, efforts were made to induce me to gamble. Whether or not my refusal seemed to the company ridiculous I cannot say, but at all events my companions played the whole evening, and were playing when I left. The dust and smoke in the room made my eyes ache. I declined, as I say, to play cards, and was, therefore, requested to discourse on philosophy, after which no one spoke to me at all—a result which I did not regret. In fact, I have no intention of going there again, since every one is for gambling, and for nothing but gambling. Even the literary tchinovnik gives such parties in his room—though, in his case, everything is done delicately and with a certain refinement, so that the thing has something of a retiring and innocent air.","In our house, Varenka, the noise begins very early in the morning: the noise of people getting out of bed, walking about, knocking on doors – all who have to are bestirring themselves, in order to go to work or to engage in their own business; everyone sets about having morning tea. Our samovars are for the most part owned by the landlady; there are not enough of them, so we all use them by turn; and woe betide anyone who takes his teapot out of turn! I did that the first time, and… but why write about it? I got to know everyone here at the same time. The warrant-officer was the first person whose acqaintance I made; he is an open fellow, and he told me everything about himself: his father, his mother, his sister, who is married to an assessor in Tula,* and about the town of Kronstadt. He promised to take me under his wing and invited me to have tea with him right then and there. I found him in the room where the people in our house usually play cards. There I was served with tea and those present insisted that I should gamble with them. Whether they were laughing at me or not, I don’t know; all I know is that they themselves had been playing all night, and when I went in they were still at it. I saw chalk, and cards; there was so much smoke in the room that it stung one’s eyes. I said I didn’t want to take part, and they at once observed that I was talking philosophy. After that no one talked to me at all; of which I was truly glad. I shall not go and see them now; all they do is gamble, nothing but gamble! The government clerk who works in the literary department also holds gatherings in the evenings. Yes, and they are pleasant and modest, innocent and delicate; it is all on a refined footing.","Very early in the morning the hubbub begins, people moving about, walking, knocking—everyone who has to is getting up, some to go to the office, others about their own business; they all begin drinking tea. The samovars for the most part belong to the landlady; there are few of them, so we all use them in turn, and if anyone goes with his teapot out of his turn, he catches it. I, for instance, the first time made that mistake, and .. but why describe it? I made the acquaintance of everyone at once. The naval man was the first I got to know; he is such an open fellow, told me everything: about his father and mother, about his sister married to an assessor in Tula, and about the town of Kronstadt. He promised to protect me and at once invited me to tea with him. I found him in the room where they usually play cards. There they gave me tea and were very insistent that I should play a game of chance with them. Whether they were laughing at me or not I don’t know, but they were losing the whole night and they were still playing when I went away. Chalk, cards—and the room so full of smoke that it made my eyes smart. I did not play and they at once observed that I was talking of philosophy. After that no one said another word to me the whole time; but to tell the truth I was glad of it. I am not going to see them now; it’s gambling with them, pure gambling. The clerk in the literary department has little gatherings in the evening, too. Well, there it is nice, quiet, harmless and delicate; everything is on a refined footing."
"Рады вы, маточка, что бог вам случай послал в свою очередь за добро добром отслужить и меня отблагодарить. Я этому верю, Варенька, и в доброту ангельского сердечка вашего верю, и не в укор вам говорю, – только не попрекайте меня, как тогда, что я на старости лет замотался. Ну, уж был грех такой, что ж делать! – если уж хотите непременно, чтобы тут грех какой был; только вот от вас-то, дружочек мой, слушать такое мне многого стоит! А вы на меня не сердитесь, что я это говорю; у меня в груди-то, маточка, все изныло. Бедные люди капризны, – это уж так от природы устроено. Я это и прежде чувствовал, а теперь еще больше почувствовал. Он, бедный-то человек, он взыскателен; он и на свет-то божий иначе смотрит, и на каждого прохожего косо глядит, да вокруг себя смущенным взором поводит, да прислушивается к каждому слову, – дескать, не про него ли там что говорят? Что вот, дескать, что же он такой неказистый? что бы он такое именно чувствовал? что вот, например, каков он будет с этого боку, каков будет с того боку? И ведомо каждому, Варенька, что бедный человек хуже ветошки и никакого ни от кого уважения получить не может, что уж там ни пиши! они-то, пачкуны-то эти, что уж там ни пиши! – все будет в бедном человеке так, как и было. А отчего же так и будет по-прежнему? А оттого, что уж у бедного человека, по-ихнему, все наизнанку должно быть; что уж у него ничего не должно быть заветного, там амбиции какой-нибудь ни-ни-ни! Вон Емеля говорил намедни, что ему где-то подписку делали, так ему за каждый гривенник, в некотором роде, официальный осмотр делали. Они думали, что они даром свои гривенники ему дают – ан нет: они заплатили за то, что им бедного человека показывали. Нынче, маточка, и благодеяния-то как-то чудно делаются… а может быть, и всегда так делались, кто их знает! Или не умеют они делать, или уж мастера большие – одно из двух. Вы, может быть, этого не знали, ну, так вот вам! В чем другом мы пас, а уж в этом известны! А почему бедный человек знает все это да думает все такое? А почему? – ну, по опыту! А оттого, например, что он знает, что есть под боком у него такой господин, что вот идет куда-нибудь к ресторану да говорит сам с собой: что вот, дескать, эта голь-чиновник что будет есть сегодня? а я соте-папильйот буду есть, а он, может быть, кашу без масла есть будет. А какое ему дело, что я буду кашу без масла есть? Бывает такой человек, Варенька, бывает, что только об таком и думает. И они ходят, пасквилянты неприличные, да смотрят, что, дескать, всей ли ногой на камень ступаешь али носочком одним; что-де вот у такого-то чиновника, такого-то ведомства, титулярного советника, из сапога голые пальцы торчат, что вот у него локти продраны – и потом там себе это всё и описывают и дрянь такую печатают… А какое тебе дело, что у меня локти продраны? Да, уж если вы мне простите, Варенька, грубое слово, так я вам скажу, что у бедного человека на этот счет тот же самый стыд, как и у вас, примером сказать, девический. Ведь вы перед всеми – грубое-то словцо мое простите – разоблачаться не станете; вот так точно и бедный человек не любит, чтобы в его конуру заглядывали, что, дескать, каковы-то там его отношения будут семейные – вот. А то что было тогда обижать меня, Варенька, купно со врагами моими, на честь и амбицию честного человека посягающими!","You are glad, mother, that God has sent you a chance, in turn, to serve good for good and thank me. I believe this, Varenka, and I believe in the kindness of your angelic heart, and I’m not speaking as a reproach to you - just don’t reproach me, as you did then, that I was winded up in my old age. Well, it was such a sin, what to do! - if you really want to be sure that there is a sin here; only from you, my friend, it costs me a lot to listen to this! Don't be angry with me for saying this; in my chest, mother, everything is tired. Poor people are capricious - that's just how it is by nature. I felt it before, but now I feel it even more. He, a poor man, he is exacting; he also looks at the light of God differently, and looks askance at every passer-by, but looks around him with an embarrassed look, and listens to every word, - they say, is there something they say about him? What, they say, why is he so unsightly? what exactly would he feel? what, for example, what will it be like from this side, what will it be like from that side? And everyone knows, Varenka, that a poor man is worse than a rag and cannot get any respect from anyone, whatever you say! they are, these bastards, whatever you write there! - everything will be in the poor man as it was. And why will it continue to be so? And because a poor person, in their opinion, should have everything inside out; that he should not have anything cherished, there are ambitions of some no-no-no! Vaughn Emelya said the other day that they made him a subscription somewhere, so for every dime, in some way, they did an official inspection for him. They thought that they were giving him their kopecks for free - but no: they paid for showing them a poor man. Today, mother, good deeds are somehow miraculously done ... or maybe they have always been done that way, who knows! Either they do not know how to do it, or the masters are great - one of the two. You may not have known this, well, here you are! In what other way do we pass, and in this we are known! And why does a poor person know all this and think all this? And why? Well, from experience! And because, for example, he knows that there is such a gentleman at his side that he is going somewhere to a restaurant and talking to himself: what, they say, this bare official is going to eat today? and I will eat saute papillot, and he, perhaps, will eat porridge without butter. And what does it matter to him that I will eat porridge without butter? Sometimes there is such a person, Varenka, sometimes he only thinks about such things. And they walk around, libelous indecent, but they look that, they say, whether you step on a stone with your whole foot or with one toe; something about such and such an official, such and such a department, a titular adviser, bare fingers sticking out of his boot, that his elbows were torn through - and then they describe it all to themselves and print such rubbish ... And what do you care that Are my elbows torn? Yes, if you will forgive me, Varenka, a rude word, then I will tell you that a poor person has the same shame on this score as you have, by example, girlish. After all, you will not begin to expose yourself in front of everyone - forgive my rude word; just like that, and the poor man does not like to be looked into his kennel, that, they say, what kind of family relations there will be - here. And the fact that it was then to offend me, Varenka, is coupled with my enemies, encroaching on the honor and ambition of an honest man!","ALEXIEVNA,—Thank God that He has sent you a chance of repaying my good with good. I believe in so doing, as well as in the sweetness of your angelic heart. Therefore, I will not reproach you. Only I pray you, do not again blame me because in the decline of my life I have played the spendthrift. It was such a sin, was it not?—such a thing to do? And even if you would still have it that the sin was there, remember, little friend, what it costs me to hear such words fall from your lips. Do not be vexed with me for saying this, for my heart is fainting. Poor people are subject to fancies—this is a provision of nature. I myself have had reason to know this. The poor man is exacting. He cannot see God’s world as it is, but eyes each passer-by askance, and looks around him uneasily in order that he may listen to every word that is being uttered. May not people be talking of him? How is it that he is so unsightly? What is he feeling at all? What sort of figure is he cutting on the one side or on the other? It is matter of common knowledge, my Barbara, that the poor man ranks lower than a rag, and will never earn the respect of any one. Yes, write about him as you like —let scribblers say what they choose about him—he will ever remain as he was. And why is this? It is because, from his very nature, the poor man has to wear his feelings on his sleeve, so that nothing about him is sacred, and as for his self-respect—! Well, Emelia told me the other day that once, when he had to collect subscriptions, official sanction was demanded for every single coin, since people thought that it would be no use paying their money to a poor man. Nowadays charity is strangely administered. Perhaps it has always been so. Either folk do not know how to administer it, or they are adept in the art—one of the two. Perhaps you did not know this, so I beg to tell it you. And how comes it that the poor man knows, is so conscious of it all? The answer is—by experience. He knows because any day he may see a gentleman enter a restaurant and ask himself, “What shall I have to eat today? I will have such and such a dish,” while all the time the poor man will have nothing to eat that day but gruel. There are men, too—wretched busybodies—who walk about merely to see if they can find some wretched tchinovnik or broken-down official who has got toes projecting from his boots or his hair uncut! And when they have found such a one they make a report of the circumstance, and their rubbish gets entered on the file.... But what does it matter to you if my hair lacks the shears? If you will forgive me what may seem to you a piece of rudeness, I declare that the poor man is ashamed of such things with the sensitiveness of a young girl. YOU, for instance, would not care (pray pardon my bluntness) to unrobe yourself before the public eye; and in the same way, the poor man does not like to be pried at or questioned concerning his family relations, and so forth. A man of honour and self-respect such as I am finds it painful and grievous to have to consort with men who would deprive him of both.","You are glad, little mother, that God has sent you an opportunity of doing one good deed in exchange for another, and of showing your gratitude. I have faith in that, Varenka, I have faith in the goodness of your angel’s heart, and I say this not as a rebuke – but please do not reproach me, as you have done, for squandering my money in my old age. Yes, if you really must insist that I have sinned, then what is there to be done about it? I have sinned; only it costs me much to hear such things from you, my little friend. You must not be angry with me for saying this; in my breast there is nothing but pain and hurt, little mother. Poor folk are capricious – that is the way nature makes them. This is not the first time I have felt it. The poor man is a severe critic; he looks at God’s world from a different angle, he furtively sizes up each person he meets, looks about him with a troubled gaze, and listens carefully to every word he overhears – are people talking about him? Are they saying he is not much to look at, wondering about what he is feeling, what he is like from this point of view and that point of view? And Varenka, everyone knows that a poor man is worth less than an old rag, and cannot hope for respect from anyone, whatever they may write, those scribblers, whatever they may write! The poor man will remain the same as he has always been. And why will he remain the same? Because, according to their lights, the poor man must be turned inside out; he must have no privacy, no dignity of any kind! Yemelya told me the other day that some people somewhere organized a whip-round for him, and that a sort of official check was made of every copeck that was paid to him. They thought they were giving him their money out of charity – but they weren’t: they were paying for having a poor man exhibited to them. Even charity is conducted in a peculiar way nowadays, little mother… but perhaps it has always been like that – who knows! Either they don’t know how to do it, or they’re past masters at it – one or the other. Perhaps you didn’t know that; well, there you are! In any other field of knowledge you can count us out, but here we’re experts! And how does it come to be that a poor man knows all this and thinks all these things? Why, because he has experience! Because, for example, he knows that there is at his side a gentleman who is going to a restaurant, saying to himself: ‘What is that ragged clerk going to eat today? I’m going to have sauté papillotte, while he is probably going to have kasha with no butter. But what business is it of his, what I’m going to eat? There is a type of man, Varenka, who thinks only about things like that. And they go about, the shameless lampoonists, looking to see whether you put the whole of your foot down on the pavement or just the tips of your toes; look, they say, such-and-such a clerk from such-and-such a department, a titular councillor, is going around with his bare toes sticking out of his boots, and the elbows of his jacket worn through – and then they go home and write about it all and then have this rubbish printed… But what business is it of his that my elbows are worn through? Indeed, if you will forgive me a coarse expression, Varenka, I will even go so far as to say that on this account the poor man has a modesty that is equivalent to your own maidenly reticence. I mean, you wouldn’t – please forgive my vulgarity – unveil yourself in front of everyone, would you? In precisely the same way the poor man doesn’t like people to look into his hideaway to see what his private life is like. And so there was no need to insult me, Varenka, taking sides with my enemies who assail the honour and personal dignity of an honest man.","You are glad, my dear girl, that God has sent you a chance to do one good turn for another and show your gratitude to me. I believe that, Varinka, and I believe in the goodness of your angelic heart, and I am not saying it to reproach you—only do not upbraid me for being a spendthrift in my old age. Well, if I have done wrong, there’s no help for it; only to hear it from you, my dearie, is very bitter! Don’t be angry with me for saying so, my heart’s all one ache. Poor people are touchy—that’s in the nature of things. I felt that even in the past. The poor man is exacting; he takes a different view of God’s world, and looks askance at every passer-by and turns a troubled gaze about him and looks to every word, wondering whether people are not talking about him, whether they are saying that he is so ugly, speculating about what he would feel exactly, what he would be on this side and what he would be on that side, and everyone knows, Varinka, that a poor man is worse than a rag and can get no respect from anyone; whatever they may write, those scribblers, it will always be the same with the poor man as it has been. And why will it always be as it has been? Because to their thinking the poor man must be turned inside out, he must have no privacy, no pride whatever! Emelyan told me the other day that they got up a subscription for him and made a sort of official inspection over every sixpence; they thought that they were giving him his sixpences for nothing, but they were not; they were paid for them by showing him he was a poor man. Nowadays, my dear soul, benevolence is practised in a very queer way . . and perhaps it always has been so, who knows! Either people don’t know how to do it or they are first-rate hands at it—one of the two. Perhaps you did not know it, so there it is for you. On anything else we can say nothing, but on this subject we are authorities! And how is it a poor man knows all this and thinks of it all like this? Why?—from experience! Because he knows for instance, that there is a gentleman at his side, who is going somewhere to a restaurant and saying to himself, “What’s this beggarly clerk going to eat to-day? I’m going to eat saute papillotte while he is going to eat porridge without butter, maybe.” And what business is it to him that I am going to eat porridge without butter? There are men, Varinka, there are men who think of nothing else. And they go about, the indecent caricaturists, and look whether one puts one’s whole foot down on the pavement or walks on tiptoe; they notice that such a clerk, of such a department, a titular councillor, has his bare toes sticking out of his boot, that he has holes in his elbow—and then they sit down at home and describe it all and publish such rubbish . . . and what business is it of yours, sir, if my elbows are in holes? Yes, if you will excuse me the coarse expression, Varinka, I will tell you that the poor man has the same sort of modesty on that score as you, for instance, have maidenly modesty. Why, you wouldn’t divest yourself of your clothing before everyone—forgive my coarse comparison. So, in the same way, the poor man does not like people to peep into his poor hole and wonder about his domestic arrangements. So what need was there to join in insulting me, Varinka, with the enemies who are attacking an honest man’s honour and reputation?"
"Посылаю вам винограду немного, душечка; для выздоравливающей это, говорят, хорошо, да и доктор рекомендует для утоления жажды, так только единственно для жажды. Вам розанчиков намедни захотелось, маточка; так вот я вам их теперь посылаю. Есть ли у вас аппетит, душечка? – вот что главное. Впрочем, слава богу, что все прошло и кончилось и что несчастия наши тоже совершенно оканчиваются. Воздадим благодарение небу! А что до книжек касается, то достать покамест нигде не могу. Есть тут, говорят, хорошая книжка одна и весьма высоким слогом написанная; говорят, что хороша, я сам не читал, а здесь очень хвалят. Я просил ее для себя; обещались препроводить. Только будете ли вы-то читать? Вы у меня на этот счет привередница; трудно угодить на ваш вкус, уж я вас знаю, голубчик вы мой; вам, верно, все стихотворство надобно, воздыханий, амуров, – ну, и стихов достану, всего достану; там есть тетрадка одна переписанная.","I send you some grapes, my dear; for a convalescent woman, they say, it’s good, and the doctor recommends it to quench thirst, so only for thirst. You wanted roses the other day, mother; So I'm sending them to you now. Do you have an appetite, darling? - that's what's important. However, thank God that everything has passed and ended, and that our misfortunes, too, are completely ending. Let's give thanks to heaven! As for books, I can't get them anywhere for the time being. There is here, they say, a good book, one and written in a very high style; they say it's good, I haven't read it myself, but here they are very praised. I asked her for myself; promised to deliver. Will you just read? You are my picky about this; it's hard to please your taste, I already know you, you're my dear; you, right, need all the poetry, sighs, cupids, - well, I’ll get poetry, I’ll get everything; there is a notebook one rewritten.","am sending you a few grapes, which are good for a convalescent person, and strongly recommended by doctors for the allayment of fever. Also, you were saying the other day that you would like some roses; wherefore, I now send you a bunch. Are you at all able to eat, my darling?—for that is the chief point which ought to be seen to. Let us thank God that the past and all its unhappiness are gone! Yes, let us give thanks to Heaven for that much! As for books, I cannot get hold of any, except for a book which, written in excellent style, is, I believe, to be had here. At all events, people keep praising it very much, and I have begged the loan of it for myself. Should you too like to read it? In this respect, indeed, I feel nervous, for the reason that it is so difficult to divine what your taste in books may be, despite my knowledge of your character. Probably you would like poetry—the poetry of sentiment and of love making? Well, I will send you a book of MY OWN poems.","I send you a few grapes, my darling; they are said to be good for those who are convalescing, and the doctor recommends them for the alleviation of thirst – especially for thirst, as it were. You expressed a wish for roses the other day, little mother; so now I send you some herewith. Do you have an appetite, my darling? – that is the most important thing. Anyway, thank God that all that is over and done with, and that our misfortunes are also drawing to a decisive close. Let us offer thanks to Heaven! But as for books, I have so far been unable to obtain them anywhere. There is said to be one particularly good book, written in a very fine style; it is supposed to be good , I have not read it myself, but everyone here sings its praises. I have ordered it, and have received the promise that it will be dispatched to me. Only will you read it? In my experience, you are hard to please in these matters; it is difficult to satisfy your taste, I know it well, my little dove; I expect what you want is poetry, lovers’ complaints, amours – well, I shall obtain poetry for you , I shall obtain everything; they have a notebook with verses copied in it there.","I send you a few grapes, my love; I am told they are good for a convalescent and the doctor recommends them for quenching the thirst—simply for thirst. You were longing the other day for a few roses, my darling, so I am sending you some now. Have you any appetite, my love?—that is the most important thing. Thank God, though, that it is all over and done with, and that our troubles, too, will be soon at an end. We must give thanks to heaven! As for books, I cannot get hold of them anywhere for the moment. I am told there is a good book here written in very fine language; they say it is good, I have not read it myself, but it is very much praised here. I have asked for it and they have promised to lend it me , only will you read it? You are so hard to please in that line; it is difficult to satisfy your taste, I know that already, my darling. No doubt you want poetry, inspiration, lyrics—well, I will get poems too, I will get anything; there is a manuscript book full of extracts here."
"Я сегодня, ангельчик мой, много испытал впечатлений. Во-первых, у меня голова целый день болела. Чтобы как-нибудь освежиться, вышел я походить по Фонтанке. Вечер был такой темный, сырой. В шестом часу уж смеркается, – вот как теперь! Дождя не было, зато был туман, не хуже доброго дождя. По небу ходили длинными широкими полосами тучи. Народу ходила бездна по набережной, и народ-то как нарочно был с такими страшными, уныние наводящими лицами, пьяные мужики, курносые бабы-чухонки, в сапогах и простоволосые, артельщики, извозчики, наш брат по какой-нибудь надобности; мальчишки, какой-нибудь слесарский ученик в полосатом халате, испитой, чахлый, с лицом, выкупанным в копченом масле, с замком в руке; солдат отставной, в сажень ростом, – вот какова была публика. Час-то, видно, был такой, что другой публики и быть не могло. Судоходный канал Фонтанка! Барок такая бездна, что не понимаешь, где все это могло поместиться. На мостах сидят бабы с мокрыми пряниками да с гнилыми яблоками и всё такие грязные, мокрые бабы. Скучно по Фонтанке гулять! Мокрый гранит под ногами, по бокам дома высокие, черные, закоптелые; под ногами туман, над головой тоже туман. Такой грустный, такой темный был вечер сегодня.","Today, my angel, I experienced a lot of impressions. First, my head hurt all day. To somehow freshen up, I went out to walk along the Fontanka. The evening was so dark and damp. At the sixth o'clock it's already getting dark - that's how it is now! There was no rain, but there was fog, no worse than a good rain. Clouds were moving across the sky in long, wide bands. There was an abyss of people walking along the embankment, and the people, as if on purpose, were with such terrible, desponding faces, drunken peasants, snub-nosed plump-nosed women in boots and simple-haired, artel workers, cabbies, our brother for some reason; boys, some locksmith's apprentice in a striped dressing gown, drunk, stunted, with a face bathed in smoked butter, with a lock in his hand; a retired soldier, a sazhen tall - that's what the audience was like. The hour, apparently, was such that there could not have been any other audience. Shipping Canal Fontanka! Baroque is such an abyss that you don’t understand where all this could fit. There are women sitting on the bridges with wet gingerbread and rotten apples, and all such dirty, wet women. It's boring to walk along the Fontanka! Wet granite underfoot, tall, black, smoky houses on the sides; Fog underfoot, fog overhead. So sad, so dark was the evening today.","MY BELOVED BARBARA,—Today I have undergone a variety of experiences. In the first place, my head has been aching, and towards evening I went out to get a breath of fresh air along the Fontanka Canal. The weather was dull and damp, and even by six o’clock, darkness had begun to set in. True, rain was not actually falling, but only a mist like rain, while the sky was streaked with masses of trailing cloud. Crowds of people were hurrying along Naberezhnaia Street, with faces that looked strange and dejected. There were drunken peasants; snub-nosed old harridans in slippers; bareheaded artisans; cab drivers; every species of beggar; boys; a locksmith’s apprentice in a striped smock, with lean, emaciated features which seemed to have been washed in rancid oil; an ex-soldier who was offering penknives and copper rings for sale; and so on, and so on. It was the hour when one would expect to meet no other folk than these. And what a quantity of boats there were on the canal. It made one wonder how they could all find room there. On every bridge were old women selling damp gingerbread or withered apples, and every woman looked as damp and dirty as her wares. In short, the Fontanka is a saddening spot for a walk, for there is wet granite under one’s feet, and tall, dingy buildings on either side of one, and wet mist below and wet mist above. Yes, all was dark and gloomy there this evening.","I have had a great many experiences today, my little angel. For one thing I have had a headache all day. In order to try to obtain some relief, I took a walk along the Fontanka. It was a damp, dark evening. It is already dark by six o’clock now – there’s a fine thing for you! There was no rain, but the fog was making up for it. Long swathes of dark cloud were passing across the sky. A huge multitude of people was making its way along the embankment, and to fit the general mood they all had the most fearful, depressing faces; drunken muzhiks, snubnosed Finnish peasant women, booted and bareheaded, workmen, cabbies, people like yours truly, out on some errand; boys, some locksmith is apprentice in a striped overall, haggard and sickly looking, his face covered in sooty oil, a lock in his hand; a retired soldier, as tall as a building – that was the sort of public it was. It was evidently the time of day when no other kind of public shows its face. The Fontanka is a navigable canal, after all. There is such a vast number of barges that one wonders how they can all get in. Peasant women sit on the bridges with soggy honeycakes and rotten apples – they are all such sodden, dirty women. It is not much fun walking along the Fontanka! Wet granite under one is feet, on either side tall, black, sooty houses; fog under one is feet, and fog above one is head. That is the sort of sad, dark evening it was today.","I have received a great number of impressions this morning, my angel. To begin with I had a headache all day. To freshen myself up a bit I went for a walk along Fontanka. It was such a damp, dark evening. By six o’clock it was getting dusk— that is what we are coming to now. It was not raining but there was mist equal to a good rain. There were broad, long stretches of storm-cloud across the sky. There were masses of people walking along the canal bank, and, as ill-luck would have it, the people had such horrible depressing faces, drunken peasants, snub-nosed Finnish women, in high boots with nothing on their heads, workmen, cab-drivers, people like me out on some errand, boys, a carpenter’s apprentice in a striped dressing-gown, thin and wasted-looking, with his face bathed in smutty oil, and a lock in his hand; a discharged soldier seven feet high waiting for somebody to buy a pen-knife or a bronze ring from him. That was the sort of crowd. It seems it was an hour when no other sort of people could be about. Fontanka is a canal for traffic! Such a mass of barges that one wonders how there can be room for them all! On the bridges there are women sitting with wet gingerbread and rotten apples, and they all of them looked so muddy, so drenched. It’s dreary walking along Fontanka! The wet granite under one’s feet, with tall, black, sooty houses on both sides. Fog underfoot and fog overhead. How dark and melancholy it was this evening!"
"Бедный старик не мог надивиться и нарадоваться на своего Петеньку (так он называл сына). Когда он приходил к нему в гости, то почти всегда имел какой-то озабоченный, робкий вид, вероятно от неизвестности, как-то его примет сын, обыкновенно долго не решался войти, и если я тут случалась, так он меня минут двадцать, бывало, расспрашивал – что, каков Петенька? здоров ли он? в каком именно расположении духа и не занимается ли чем-нибудь важным? Что он именно делает? Пишет ли, или размышлениями какими занимается? Когда я его достаточно ободряла и успокоивала, то старик наконец решался войти и тихо-тихо, осторожно-осторожно отворял двери, просовывал сначала одну голову, и если видел, что сын не сердится и кивнул ему головой, то тихонько проходил в комнату, снимал свою шинельку, шляпу, которая вечно у него была измятая, дырявая, с оторванными полями, – все вешал на крюк, все делал тихо, неслышно; потом садился где-нибудь осторожно на стул и с сына глаз не спускал, все движения его ловил, желая угадать расположение духа своего Петеньки. Если сын чуть-чуть был не в духе и старик примечал это, то тотчас приподымался с места и объяснял, «что, дескать, я так, Петенька, я на минутку. Я вот далеко ходил, проходил мимо и отдохнуть зашел». И потом безмолвно, покорно брал свою шинельку, шляпенку, опять потихоньку отворял дверь и уходил, улыбаясь через силу, чтобы удержать в душе накипевшее горе и не выказать его сыну.","The poor old man could not be surprised and rejoiced at his Petenka (as he called his son). When he came to visit him, he almost always had some kind of preoccupied, timid look, probably from the unknown, somehow his son would accept him, usually he didn’t dare to enter for a long time, and if I happened to be here, he would take me about twenty minutes, it happened , asked - what, what is Petenka? is he well? in what kind of mood exactly and is he doing something important? What exactly is he doing? Does he write, or what kind of thoughts does he do? When I had sufficiently encouraged and reassured him, the old man finally made up his mind to enter and quietly, quietly, cautiously, carefully opened the doors, first poking one head out, and if he saw that his son was not angry and nodded his head to him, then he quietly went into the room, took off his his overcoat, his hat, which he always had crumpled, full of holes, with torn-off brim - he hung everything on a hook, did everything quietly, inaudibly; then he would sit down somewhere carefully on a chair and never take his eyes off his son, catching all his movements, wanting to guess the mood of his Petenka. If the son was a little out of sorts and the old man noticed this, he immediately got up from his seat and explained, “What, they say, I’m like that, Petenka, I’m just a minute. I walked far, passed by and went to rest. And then silently, obediently, he took his overcoat and hat, again slowly opened the door and left, smiling through his strength, in order to keep the grief boiling in his soul and not show it to his son.","On the subject of his Petinka, as he called him, the poor old man could never sufficiently rhapsodise and dilate. Yet when he arrived to see his son he almost invariably had on his face a downcast, timid expression that was probably due to uncertainty concerning the way in which he would be received. For a long time he would hesitate to enter, and if I happened to be there he would question me for twenty minutes or so as to whether his Petinka was in good health, as well as to the sort of mood he was in, whether he was engaged on matters of importance, what precisely he was doing (writing or meditating), and so on. Then, when I had sufficiently encouraged and reassured the old man, he would make up his mind to enter, and quietly and cautiously open the door. Next, he would protrude his head through the chink, and if he saw that his son was not angry, but threw him a nod, he would glide noiselessly into the room, take off his scarf, and hang up his hat (the latter perennially in a bad state of repair, full of holes, and with a smashed brim)—the whole being done without a word or a sound of any kind. Next, the old man would seat himself warily on a chair, and, never removing his eyes from his son, follow his every movement, as though seeking to gauge Petinka’s state of mind. On the other hand, if the son was not in good spirits, the father would make a note of the fact, and at once get up, saying that he had “only called for a minute or two,” that, “having been out for a long walk, and happening at the moment to be passing,” he had “looked in for a moment’s rest.” Then silently and humbly the old man would resume his hat and scarf; softly he would open the door, and noiselessly depart with a forced smile on his face—the better to bear the disappointment which was seething in his breast, the better to help him not to show it to his son.","The poor old man could not sufficiently admire and dote upon his Petenka (as he called his son). Whenever he called to visit him, he nearly always had a worried, timid look, probably because he did not know how his son would receive him. He would usually spend a long time hesitating whether to come in or not, and if I chanced to be there, he would question me for about twenty minutes, asking me about ‘Petenka’ and how his health was, what kind of mood he was in, whether he was engaged in any important study, what he was actually doing – whether he was writing or absorbed in reflection. When I had sufficiently raised his spirits and put his mind at rest, the old man would finally make up his mind to come in and very quietly, very gingerly, he would open the door, and begin by putting his head round it; if he saw that his son was not in a bad temper and nodded to him, he would slowly enter the room, take off his overcoat and his hat – which was always squashed, full of holes, and ragged-brimmed – and hang both on a hook, performing the action slowly and inaudibly; then he would sit down carefully on a chair somewhere, never taking his eyes off his son, following his every movement in an attempt to guess the frame of mind his Petenka was in. If his son was even slightly in a bad mood and the old man was able to observe this, he would at once rise from his seat and explain: ‘I only dropped in for a moment, Petenka. I’ve been out for a long walk, I was passing, and looked in to take a rest.’ And then silently and obediently he would take his hat and overcoat, slowly open the door once again and go out, smiling to his son, smiling forcedly in order to keep to himself the misery that seethed within him, and not show it to his son.","The poor old man could not sufficiently admire and marvel at his Petinka (as he called his son). When he came to see him he almost always had a timid, careworn air, most likely from uncertainty as to the reception his son would give him. He was usually a long time making up his mind to come in, and if I happened to be there he would spend twenty minutes questioning me: “How was Petinka? Was he quite well? What sort of mood was he in, and was he busy over anything important? What was he doing? Was he writing, or absorbed in reflection?” When I had sufficiently cheered and reassured him, the old man at last ventured to come in, and very, very quietly, very, very cautiously opened the door, first poked in his head, and if his son nodded to him and the old man saw he was not angry, he moved stealthily into the room, took off his overcoat and his hat, which was always crushed, full of holes and with a broken brim, hung them on a hook, did everything quietly, noiselessly; then cautiously sat down on a chair, never taking his eyes off his son, watching every movement and trying to guess what mood his “Petinka” was in. If his son seemed ever so little out of humour and the old man noticed it, he got up from his seat at once and explained, “I just looked in, Petinka, only for a minute. I have been on a long walk, I was passing and came in for a rest.” And then, dumbly, submissively he would take his coat, his wretched hat, again he would stealthily open the door and go away, keeping a forced smile on his face to check the rush of disappointment in his heart and to hide it from his son."

"Милостивый государь, Макар Алексеевич!","Dear sir, Makar Alekseevich!",MY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH—,"Makar Alekseyevich, Sir,","DEAR SIR, MAKAR ALEXYEVITCH,"
"Я сегодня Федору видел, голубчик мой. Она говорит, что вас уже завтра венчают, а послезавтра вы едете и что господин Быков уже лошадей нанимает. Насчет его превосходительства я уже уведомлял вас, маточка. Да еще: счеты из магазина я в Гороховой проверил: все верно, да только очень дорого. Только за что же господин-то Быков на вас сердится? Ну, будьте счастливы, маточка! Я рад; да, я буду рад, если вы будете счастливы. Я бы пришел в церковь, маточка, да не могу, болит поясница. Так вот я все насчет писем: ведь вот кто же теперь их передавать-то нам будет, маточка? Да! Вы Федору-то облагодетельствовали, родная моя! Это доброе дело вы сделали, друг мой; это вы очень хорошо сделали. Доброе дело! А за каждое доброе дело вас господь благословлять будет. Добрые дела не остаются без награды, и добродетель всегда будет увенчана венцом справедливости божией, рано ли, поздно ли. Маточка! Я бы вам много хотел написать, так, каждый час, каждую минуту все бы писал, все бы писал! У меня еще ваша книжка осталась одна, «Белкина повести», так вы ее, знаете, маточка, не берите ее у меня, подарите ее мне, мой голубчик. Это не потому, что уж мне так ее читать хочется. Но сами вы знаете, маточка, подходит зима; вечера будут длинные; грустно будет, так вот бы и почитать. Я, маточка, перееду с моей квартиры на вашу старую и буду нанимать у Федоры. Я с этой честной женщиной теперь ни за что не расстанусь; к тому же она такая работящая. Я вашу квартиру опустевшую вчера подробно осматривал. Там, как были ваши пялечки, а на них шитье, так они и остались нетронутые: в углу стоят. Я ваше шитье рассматривал. Остались еще тут лоскуточки разные. На одно письмецо мое вы ниточки начали было наматывать. В столике нашел бумажки листочек, а на бумажке написано: «Милостивый государь, Макар Алексеевич, спешу» – и только. Видно, вас кто-нибудь прервал на самом интересном месте. В углу за ширмочками ваша кроватка стоит… Голубчик вы мой!!! Ну, прощайте, прощайте; ради бога, отвечайте мне что-нибудь на это письмецо поскорее.","I saw Fedora today, my dear. She says that you are being crowned tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow you are going, and that Mr. Bykov is already hiring horses. As for His Excellency, I have already informed you, mother. Moreover: I checked the invoices from the store in Gorokhovaya: everything is correct, but only very expensive. But why is Mr. Bykov angry with you? Well, be happy, mother! I am pleased to; Yes, I will be glad if you are happy. I would come to church, mother, but I can’t, my lower back hurts. So I'm all about letters: after all, now who will send them to us, mother? Yes! You did something good to Fyodor, my dear! This is a good deed you have done, my friend; you did it very well. Good deed! And for every good deed, the Lord will bless you. Good deeds do not go unrewarded, and virtue will always be crowned with the crown of God's justice, sooner or later. Matochka! I would like to write a lot to you, so, every hour, every minute I would write everything, I would write everything! I still have one book of yours left, ""Belkin's Tale"", so you know her, mother, do not take it from me, give it to me, my dear. It's not because I really want to read it. But you yourself know, mother, winter is coming; the evenings will be long; it will be sad, so that's what to read. I, mother, will move from my apartment to your old one and will hire from Fedora. I will never part with this honest woman now; Plus she's so hard working. I inspected your apartment, which was empty yesterday, in detail. There, as there were your hoops, and sewing on them, so they remained untouched: they are standing in the corner. I looked at your sewing. There are still some scraps left. You started winding threads on one of my letters. I found a piece of paper in the table, and on the piece of paper it was written: “Dear sir, Makar Alekseevich, I am in a hurry” - and nothing more. Apparently, someone interrupted you at the most interesting place. In the corner behind the screens is your bed ... My dear, you are mine !!! Well, goodbye, goodbye; for God's sake, answer me something to this letter as soon as possible.","MY OWN BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,—Today, dearest, I saw Thedora, who informed me that you are to be married tomorrow, and on the following day to go away—for which purpose Bwikov has ordered a post-chaise.... Well, of the incident of his Excellency, I have already told you. Also I have verified the bill from the shop in Gorokhovaia Street. It is correct, but very long. Why is Monsieur Bwikov so out of humour with you? Nay, but you must be of good cheer, my darling. I am so, and shall always be so, so long as you are happy. I should have come to the church tomorrow, but, alas, shall be prevented from doing so by the pain in my loins. Also, I would have written an account of the ceremony, but that there will be no one to report to me the details.... Yes, you have been a very good friend to Thedora, dearest. You have acted kindly, very kindly, towards her. For every such deed God will bless you. Good deeds never go unrewarded, nor does virtue ever fail to win the crown of divine justice, be it early or be it late. Much else should I have liked to write to you. Every hour, every minute I could occupy in writing. Indeed I could write to you forever! Only your book, “The Stories of Bielkin”, is left to me. Do not deprive me of it, I pray you, but suffer me to keep it. It is not so much because I wish to read the book for its own sake, as because winter is coming on, when the evenings will be long and dreary, and one will want to read at least SOMETHING. Do you know, I am going to move from my present quarters into your old ones, which I intend to rent from Thedora; for I could never part with that good old woman. Moreover, she is such a splendid worker. Yesterday I inspected your empty room in detail, and inspected your embroidery-frame, with the work still hanging on it. It had been left untouched in its corner. Next, I inspected the work itself, of which there still remained a few remnants, and saw that you had used one of my letters for a spool upon which to wind your thread. Also, on the table I found a scrap of paper which had written on it, “My dearest Makar Alexievitch I hasten to—” that was all. Evidently, someone had interrupted you at an interesting point. Lastly, behind a screen there was your little bed.... Oh darling of darlings!!! ... Well, goodbye now, goodbye now, but for God’s sake send me something in answer to this letter!","I saw Fedora today, my little dove. She said you are getting married tomorrow, that the day after you are going away and that Mr Bykov is already hiring the horses. I have already informed you of His Excellency’s behaviour, little mother. Oh, there is something else: I have checked the bills from the shop in Gorokhovaya Street; they are all correct, but the things are all very expensive. So why is it you at whom Mr Bykov lets fly his bad temper? Well, be happy, little mother! I am glad; yes, and I will go on being glad, as long as you are happy. I would come to the church service, little mother, but I can’t, I have lumbago. I am still worried about our letters: who will deliver them for us now, little mother? Yes! You have been a friend and protector to Fedora, my darling. That is a good deed that you have done, my friend; that is a very good deed that you have done. A good deed! And for each of your good deeds the Lord will bless you. Good deeds do not go unrewarded, and virtue will sooner or later be adorned with the crown of divine justice. Little mother! There is much that I would like to write you – I could spend each and every hour, each and every minute of the day just writing and writing to you! I still have one of your books, Tales of Belkin. You know, little mother, I would like to ask you to let me keep it – make me a present of it, my little dove. It’s not even that I feel like reading it so much just now. But you know yourself how it is, little mother: winter is approaching, the evenings will be long, one will be sad, and then one will feel like reading. I am going to move out of my lodging into your old apartment and rent it together with Fedora. I would not part from that honest woman now for anything in the world; what’s more, she’s such a hard worker. I made a careful inspection of your empty apartment yesterday. Your lace-frame there, and your sewing on it, have not been touched: they are in the corner. I examined your sewing. There were still one or two scraps of cloth lying about. You had begun to wind some of your thread round one of my miserable letters. In the little bureau I found a sheet of paper with the words ‘Makar Alekseyevich, Sir, I am in a hurry’ on it – nothing more. Someone had evidently interrupted you just as you were getting to the most interesting part. Your little bed still stands in the corner, behind the screen… My little dove!!! Well, goodbye, goodbye ; for the love of God, write me some reply to this miserable letter as soon as you are able.","I saw Fedora to-day, my darling, she says that you are to be married to-morrow, and that the day after you are setting off, and that Mr. Bykov is engaging horses already. I have told you about his Excellency already, my darling. Another thing—I have checked the bills from the shop in Gorohovoy; it is all correct, only the things are very dear. But why is Mr. Bykov angry with you? Well, may you be happy, Varinka! I am glad, yes, I shall be glad if you are happy. I should come to the church, my dear, but I’ve got lumbago. So I keep on about our letters; who will carry them for us, my precious? Yes! You have been a good friend to Fedora, my own! You have done a good deed, my dear, you have done quite right. It’s a good deed! And God will bless you for every good deed. Good deeds never go unrewarded, and virtue will sooner or later be rewarded by the eternal justice of God. Varinka! I wanted to write to you a great deal; I could go on writing and writing every minute, every hour! I have one of your books still, Byelkin’s Stories. I tell you what, Varinka, don’t take it away, make me a present of it, my darling. It is not so much that I want to read it. But you know yourself, my darling, winter is coming on: the evenings will be long; it will be sad, and then I could read. I shall move from my lodgings, Varinka, into your old room and lodge with Fedora. I would not part from that honest woman for anything now; besides, she is such a hard-working woman. I looked at your empty room carefully yesterday. Your embroidery frame has remained untouched, just as it was with embroidery on it. I examined your needlework; there were all sorts of little scraps left there, you had begun winding thread on one of my letters. On the little table I found a piece of paper with the words “Dear Makar Alexyevitch, I hasten—” and that was all. Someone must have interrupted you at the most interesting place. In the corner behind the screen stands your little bed.... Oh, my darling!!! Well, good-bye, good-bye, send me some answer to this letter quickly."

"Дни проходили за днями, и каждый день был похож на предыдущий. Мы жили тихо, как будто и не в городе. Анна Федоровна мало-помалу утихала, по мере того как сама стала вполне сознавать свое владычество. Ей, впрочем, никогда и никто не думал прекословить. В нашей комнате мы были отделены от ее половины коридором, а рядом с нами, как я уже упоминала, жил Покровский. Он учил Сашу французскому и немецкому языкам, истории, географии – всем наукам, как говорила Анна Федоровна, и за то получал от нее квартиру и стол; Саша была препонятливая девочка, хотя резвая и шалунья; ей было тогда лет тринадцать. Анна Федоровна заметила матушке, что недурно бы было, если бы и я стала учиться, затем, что в пансионе меня недоучили. Матушка с радостию согласилась, и я целый год училась у Покровского вместе с Сашей.","Day after day passed, and each day was like the previous one. We lived quietly, as if we were not in the city. Anna Fedorovna gradually calmed down, in proportion as she herself became fully aware of her dominion. However, no one ever thought to rebuke her. In our room, we were separated from its half by a corridor, and next to us, as I already mentioned, Pokrovsky lived. He taught Sasha French and German, history, geography - all the sciences, as Anna Fedorovna said, and for that he received an apartment and a table from her; Sasha was a preoccupied girl, although frisky and a naughty one; she was then thirteen years old. Anna Fyodorovna remarked to my mother that it would not be bad if I began to study, then that in the boarding school I was undereducated. Mother gladly agreed, and for a whole year I studied with Pokrovsky together with Sasha.","Day succeeded day, and each day was like the last one. We lived a life as quiet as though we had been in the country. Anna herself grew quieter in proportion as she came to realise the extent of her power over us. In nothing did we dare to thwart her. From her portion of the house our apartment was divided by a corridor, while next to us (as mentioned above) dwelt a certain Pokrovski, who was engaged in teaching Sasha the French and German languages, as well as history and geography—“all the sciences,” as Anna used to say. In return for these services he received free board and lodging. As for Sasha, she was a clever, but rude and uncouth, girl of thirteen. On one occasion Anna remarked to my mother that it might be as well if I also were to take some lessons, seeing that my education had been neglected at school; and, my mother joyfully assenting, I joined Sasha for a year in studying under this Pokrovski.","Day followed day, and every one of them was the same as the others. We lived a quiet life, not like a life in town at all. Anna Fyodorovna gradually calmed down as she began fully to realize the extent of her power. But no one ever dared to contradict her. Our room was separated from her half of the house by a corridor, and next to us, as I have already mentioned, lived Pokrovsky. He taught Sasha French and German, history, geography – ‘all the sciences’, as Anna Fyodorovna used to say, providing him in return for this with board and lodging; Sasha was a nimble-minded girl, though she was playful and naughty; at that time she was thirteen. Anna Fyodorovna made it known to Mother that she would consider it not a bad idea for me to start lessons with Pokrovsky too, since they were not teaching me properly at my boarding-school. Mother readily agreed, and for a whole year I took lessons from Pokrovsky together with Sasha.","The days passed and each day was like the one before. We lived as quietly as if we were not in a town. Anna Fyodorovna calmed down by degrees as she began fully to recognise her power. Though, indeed, no one ever thought of contradicting her. We were separated from her rooms by the corridor, and Pokrovsky’s room was, as I have mentioned before, next to ours. He used to teach Sasha French and German, history, geography—all the sciences, as Anna Fyodorovna said, and for this he had his board and lodging from her. Sasha was a very intelligent child, though playful and mischievous; she was thirteen. Anna Fyodorovna observed to mother that it would not be amiss if I were to have lessons, since my education had not been finished at the boarding-school, and for a whole year I shared Sasha’s lessons with Pokrovsky."

"Федора принесла мне сегодня пятнадцать рублей серебром. Как она была рада, бедная, когда я ей три целковых дала! Пишу вам наскоро. Я теперь крою вам жилетку, – прелесть какая материя, – желтенькая с цветочками. Посылаю вам одну книжку; тут все разные повести; я прочла кое-какие; прочтите одну из них под названием «Шинель». Вы меня уговариваете в театр идти вместе с вами; не дорого ли это будет? Разве уж куда-нибудь в галерею. Я уж очень давно не была в театре, да и, право, не помню когда. Только опять все боюсь, не дорого ли будет стоить эта затея? Федора только головой покачивает. Она говорит, что вы совсем не по достаткам жить начали; да я и сама это вижу; сколько вы на меня одну истратили! Смотрите, друг мой, не было бы беды. Федора и так мне говорила про какие-то слухи – что вы имели, кажется, спор с вашей хозяйкой за неуплату ей денег; я очень боюсь за вас. Ну, прощайте; я спешу. Дело есть маленькое; я переменяю ленты на шляпке.","Fyodor brought me fifteen silver rubles today. How glad she was, poor thing, when I gave her three rubles! I am writing to you soon. Now I'm cutting you a waistcoat - what a lovely fabric - yellow with flowers. I am sending you one book; there are all different stories; I have read some; read one of them called ""Overcoat"". You persuade me to go to the theater with you; wouldn't that be expensive? Is it somewhere in the gallery. I haven't been to the theater for a very long time, and, really, I don't remember when. Only again I'm afraid that this idea will cost a lot? Fedora just shakes her head. She says that you did not begin to live according to your means; yes, I see it myself; how much did you spend on me alone! Look, my friend, there would be no trouble. Fedora was already telling me about some rumors - that you had, it seems, a dispute with your mistress for not paying her money; I am very afraid for you. Well, goodbye; I'm in a hurry. There is a small matter; I change the ribbons on my hat.","ALEXIEVITCH,—Today Thedora came to me with fifteen roubles in silver. How glad was the poor woman when I gave her three of them! I am writing to you in great haste, for I am busy cutting out a waistcoat to send to you—buff, with a pattern of flowers. Also I am sending you a book of stories; some of which I have read myself, particularly one called “The Cloak.” ... You invite me to go to the theatre with you. But will it not cost too much? Of course we might sit in the gallery. It is a long time (indeed I cannot remember when I last did so) since I visited a theatre! Yet I cannot help fearing that such an amusement is beyond our means. Thedora keeps nodding her head, and saying that you have taken to living above your income. I myself divine the same thing by the amount which you have spent upon me. Take care, dear friend, that misfortune does not come of it, for Thedora has also informed me of certain rumours concerning your inability to meet your landlady’s bills. In fact, I am very anxious about you. Now, goodbye, for I must hasten away to see about another matter—about the changing of the ribands on my bonnet.","Today Fedora brought me fifteen silver rubles. How pleased she was, poor woman, when I let her have three! I write to you in haste. I am making you a waistcoat – it’s a gorgeous material, yellow with flowers. I am sending you a book: it contains all sorts of stories; I’ve read one or two of them; read the one called The Overcoat. * You are trying to persuade me to go to the theatre with you; won’t that be rather expensive? Perhaps we could get seats in the gallery. It is a very long time since I went to the theatre, in fact I can’t actually remember when it last was. The only thing that makes me hesitate is again the question of whether it won’t be too expensive. Fedora merely shakes her head. She says you have started to live far beyond your means; indeed I can see that for myself, in all the money you have spent on me! My friend, be careful you do not get into trouble. Fedora has hinted to me that there are certain rumours – that you have had a quarrel with your landlady about the non-payment of rent; I am very concerned for you. Well, goodbye; I must hurry. I have a little business to attend to, I’m changing the ribbon on my hat.","Fedora brought me fifteen silver roubles to-day. How pleased she was, poor thing, when I gave her three! I write to you in haste. I am now cutting you out a waistcoat— it’s charming material— yellow with flowers on it.

"Нужно заметить, что он терпеть не мог, когда кто-нибудь хозяйничал в его владениях. Беда тому, кто дотрогивался до книг его! Судите же о моем ужасе, когда книги, маленькие, большие, всевозможных форматов, всевозможной величины и толщины, ринулись с полки, полетели, запрыгали под столом, под стульями, по всей комнате. Я было хотела бежать, но было поздно. «Кончено, думаю, кончено! Я пропала, погибла! Я балую, резвлюсь, как десятилетний ребенок; я глупая девчонка! Я большая дура!!» Покровский рассердился ужасно. «Ну вот, этого недоставало еще! – закричал он. – Ну, не стыдно ли вам так шалить!.. Уйметесь ли вы когда-нибудь?» И сам бросился подбирать книги. Я было нагнулась помогать ему. «Не нужно, не нужно, – закричал он. – Лучше бы вы сделали, если б не ходили туда, куда вас не просят». Но, впрочем, немного смягченный моим покорным движением, он продолжал уже тише, в недавнем наставническом тоне, пользуясь недавним правом учителя: «Ну, когда вы остепенитесь, когда вы одумаетесь? Ведь вы на себя посмотрите, ведь уж вы не ребенок, не маленькая девочка, ведь вам уже пятнадцать лет!» И тут, вероятно, желая поверить, справедливо ли то, что я уж не маленькая, он взглянул на меня и покраснел до ушей. Я не понимала; я стояла перед ним и смотрела на него во все глаза в изумлении. Он привстал, подошел с смущенным видом ко мне, смешался ужасно, что-то заговорил, кажется в чем-то извинялся, может быть в том, что только теперь заметил, что я такая большая девушка. Наконец, я поняла. Я не помню, что со мной тогда сталось; я смешалась, потерялась, покраснела еще больше Покровского, закрыла лицо руками и выбежала из комнаты.","It should be noted that he could not stand it when someone was in charge of his possessions. Woe to him who touched his books! Judge my horror when books, small, large, of various formats, of various sizes and thicknesses, rushed from the shelf, flew, jumped under the table, under the chairs, all over the room. I wanted to run, but it was too late. ""It's over, I think it's over! I'm lost, I'm dead! I pamper, frolic like a ten-year-old child; I'm a stupid girl! I'm a big fool!!"" Pokrovsky was terribly angry. “Well, that’s still missing! he shouted. “Well, aren’t you ashamed to be so naughty! .. Will you ever calm down?” And he rushed to pick up books. I bent down to help him. “No need, no need,” he shouted. “You would do better if you didn’t go where you are not asked.” But, however, slightly softened by my submissive movement, he continued already more quietly, in a recently mentoring tone, using the teacher’s recent right: “Well, when will you settle down, when will you come to your senses? After all, look at yourself, because you are no longer a child, not a little girl, because you are already fifteen years old! And then, probably wanting to believe whether it was fair that I was no longer small, he looked at me and blushed to the ears. I didn't understand; I stood in front of him and looked at him with wide eyes in amazement. He half got up, came up to me with an embarrassed look, mingled terribly, started talking about something, it seemed he was apologizing for something, maybe that he had only now noticed that I was such a big girl. Finally, I understood. I don't remember what happened to me then; I was confused, lost, blushed even more than Pokrovsky, covered my face with my hands and ran out of the room.","I must here remark that he never could bear to have his possessions tampered with. Woe to the person, in particular, who touched his books! Judge, therefore, of my horror when books small and great, books of every possible shape and size and thickness, came tumbling from the shelf, and flew and sprang over the table, and under the chairs, and about the whole room. I would have turned and fled, but it was too late. “All is over!” thought I. “All is over! I am ruined, I am undone! Here have I been playing the fool like a ten-year-old child! What a stupid girl I am! The monstrous fool!” Indeed, Pokrovski was very angry. “What? Have you not done enough?” he cried. “Are you not ashamed to be for ever indulging in such pranks? Are you NEVER going to grow sensible?” With that he darted forward to pick up the books, while I bent down to help him. “You need not, you need not!” he went on. “You would have done far better not to have entered without an invitation.” Next, a little mollified by my humble demeanour, he resumed in his usual tutorial tone—the tone which he had adopted in his new-found role of preceptor: “When are you going to grow steadier and more thoughtful? Consider yourself for a moment. You are no longer a child, a little girl, but a maiden of fifteen.” Then, with a desire (probably) to satisfy himself that I was no longer a being of tender years, he threw me a glance—but straightway reddened to his very ears. This I could not understand, but stood gazing at him in astonishment. Presently, he straightened himself a little, approached me with a sort of confused expression, and haltingly said something—probably it was an apology for not having before perceived that I was now a grown-up young person. But the next moment I understood. What I did I hardly know, save that, in my dismay and confusion, I blushed even more hotly than he had done and, covering my face with my hands, rushed from the room.","I should observe that he could not abide anyone interfering with his possessions. Woe betide anyone who laid a finger on his books! Consider, then, my sense of horror when those books – large and small, of every imaginable format, size and thickness – came hurtling down from the shelf and went careering and fluttering under the table, under the chairs, all over the room. I would have made my escape, but it was too late. ‘I’m finished,’ I thought, ‘finished! It’s all up with me, I’m for it! I’m being silly and naughty like a child of ten years old: I’m just a stupid little girl! A big idiot!’ Pokrovsky flew into the most dreadful rage. ‘ Well, that’s all that was wanting!’ he cried. ‘Well, aren’t you ashamed to play silly pranks like this?… Won’t you ever learn any sense?’ And he rushed to pick up the books. I began to stoop down in order to help him. ‘Don’t, don’t!’ he cried. ‘You would do better not to go where you have not been invited.’ Then, however, slightly mollified by my submissive behaviour, he continued more quietly, in his customary teacher’s voice, taking advantage of his customary teacher’s authority: ‘Well, when are you going to learn some self-control and start to behave sensibly, for a change? I mean, just look at you , you’re not a child, you’re not a little girl any longer – you’re fifteen years old!’ And at this point, doubtless in an endeavour to make sure that I really was no longer a little girl, he cast a glance at me and blushed to the roots of his hair. At first, I did not understand; I stood in front of him, staring at him in amazement. He got up, approached me with an air of embarrassment, grew horribly confused, and started to speak: he was evidently apologizing for something, perhaps for only now having noticed that I was such a big girl. At last I understood. I can’t remember what happened to me then; I grew confused, flustered, blushed even deeper than Pokrovsky, covered my face with my hands and ran out of the room.","I must observe that he could not bear anyone to meddle in his domain. Woe to anyone who touched his books! Imagine my horror when the books, little and big, of all sizes and shapes dashed off the shelf, flew dancing under the table, under the chairs, all over the room! I would have run, but it was too late. It is all over, I thought, it is all over. I am lost, I am done for! I am naughty and mischievous like a child of ten, I am a silly chit of a girl! I am a great fool! Pokrovsky was dreadfully angry. “Well, this is the last straw!” he shouted. “Are not you ashamed to be so mischievous? ... Will you ever learn sense?” and he rushed to collect the books. “Don‘t, don’t!” he shouted. “You would do better not to come where you are not invited.” A little softened, however, by my humble movement, he went on more quietly, in his usual lecturing tone, speaking as though he were still my teacher: “Why, when will you learn to behave properly and begin to be sensible? You should look at yourself. You are not a little child. You are not a little girl. Why, you are fifteen!” And at that point, probably to satisfy himself that I was not a little girl, he glanced at me and blushed up to his ears. I did not understand. I stood before him staring in amazement. He got up, came towards me with an embarrassed air, was horribly confused, said something, seemed to be apologising for something, perhaps for having only just noticed that I was such a big girl. At last I understood. I don’t remember what happened to me then; I was overcome with confusion, lost my head, blushed even more crimson than Pokrovsky, hid my face in my hands and ran out of the room."

"Я к тому про шарманщика этого заговорил, маточка, что случилось мне бедность свою вдвойне испытать сегодня. Остановился я посмотреть на шарманщика. Мысли такие лезли в голову, – так я, чтобы рассеяться, остановился. Стою я, стоят извозчики, девка какая-то да еще маленькая девочка, вся такая запачканная. Шарманщик расположился перед чьими-то окнами. Замечаю малютку, мальчика, так себе лет десяти; был бы хорошенький, да на вид больной такой, чахленький, в одной рубашонке да еще в чем-то, чуть ли не босой стоит, разиня рот музыку слушает – детский возраст! загляделся, как у немца куклы танцуют, а у самого и руки и ноги окоченели, дрожит да кончик рукава грызет. Примечаю, что в руках у него бумажечка какая-то. Прошел один господин и бросил шарманщику какую-то маленькую монетку; монетка прямо упала в тот ящик с огородочкой, в котором представлен француз, танцующий с дамами. Только что звякнула монетка, встрепенулся мой мальчик, робко осмотрелся кругом да, видно, на меня подумал, что я деньги дал. Подбежал он ко мне, ручонки дрожат у него, голосенок дрожит, протянул он ко мне бумажку и говорит: записка! Развернул я записку – ну что, все известное: дескать, благодетели мои, мать у детей умирает, трое детей голодают, так вы нам теперь помогите; а вот, как я умру, так за то, что птенцов моих теперь не забыли, на том свете вас, благодетели мои, не забуду. Ну, что тут; дело ясное, дело житейское, а что мне им дать? Ну, и не дал ему ничего. А как было жаль! Мальчик бедненький, посинелый от холода, может быть и голодный, и не врет, ей-ей не врет; я это дело знаю. Но только то дурно, что зачем эти гадкие матери детей не берегут и полуголых с записками на такой холод посылают. Она, может быть, глупая баба, характера не имеет; да за нее и постараться, может быть, некому, так она и сидит, поджав ноги, может быть, и вправду больная. Ну, да все обратиться бы, куда следует; а впрочем, может быть, и просто мошенница, нарочно голодного и чахлого ребенка обманывать народ посылает, на болезнь наводит. И чему научится бедный мальчик с этими записками? Только сердце его ожесточается; ходит он, бегает, просит. Ходят люди, да некогда им. Сердца у них каменные; слова их жестокие. «Прочь! убирайся! шалишь!» Вот что слышит он от всех, и ожесточается сердце ребенка, и дрожит напрасно на холоде бедненький, запуганный мальчик, словно птенчик, из разбитого гнездышка выпавший. Зябнут у него руки и ноги; дух занимается. Посмотришь, вот он уж и кашляет; тут недалеко ждать, и болезнь, как гад нечистый, заползет ему в грудь, а там, глядишь, и смерть уж стоит над ним, где-нибудь в смрадном углу, без ухода, без помощи – вот и вся его жизнь! Вот какова она, жизнь-то бывает! Ох, Варенька, мучительно слышать Христа ради, и мимо пройти, и не дать ничего, сказать ему: «Бог подаст». Иное Христа ради еще ничего. (И Христа ради-то разные бывают, маточка). Иное долгое, протяжное, привычное, заученное, прямо нищенское; этому еще не так мучительно не подать, это долгий нищий, давнишний, по ремеслу нищий, этот привык, думаешь, он переможет и знает, как перемочь. А иное Христа ради непривычное, грубое, страшное, – вот как сегодня, когда я было от мальчика записку взял, тут же у забора какой-то стоял, не у всех и просил, говорит мне: «Дай, барин, грош ради Христа!» – да таким отрывистым грубым голосом, что я вздрогнул от какого-то страшного чувства, а не дал гроша: не было. А еще люди богатые не любят, чтобы бедняки на худой жребий вслух жаловались – дескать, они беспокоят, они-де назойливы! Да и всегда бедность назойлива, – спать, что ли, мешают их стоны голодные!","I also spoke about this organ grinder, mother, that it happened to me to experience my poverty twice today. I stopped to look at the organ grinder. Such thoughts entered my head, so I stopped to disperse. I’m standing, cab drivers are standing, some kind of girl, and even a little girl, all so dirty. The organ-grinder settled down in front of someone's windows. I notice a little boy, so-so about ten years old; he would be pretty, but he looks so sick, stunted, in one shirt and even in something, almost barefoot, listening to music with his mouth open - childish age! I looked at how the German dolls were dancing, and at the same time both his arms and legs were stiff, he was trembling and the tip of his sleeve was gnawing. I notice that he has some kind of paper in his hands. A gentleman passed by and threw some small coin to the organ grinder; the coin fell straight into the little box with the vegetable garden, which shows a Frenchman dancing with the ladies. A coin had just jingled, my boy started up, looked around timidly and, apparently, he thought of me that I had given money. He ran up to me, his hands were trembling, his little voice was trembling, he handed me a piece of paper and said: note! I unfolded the note - well, everything is known: they say, my benefactors, the mother of the children is dying, three children are starving, so now you help us; but when I die, because now my chicks are not forgotten, in the next world I will not forget you, my benefactors. Well, what is there; it’s a clear matter, a matter of life, but what can I give them? Well, I didn't give him anything. What a pity! The poor boy, blue from the cold, maybe hungry, and he doesn’t lie, she doesn’t lie; I know this business. But the only bad thing is that why these nasty mothers do not take care of their children and send them half-naked with notes to such a cold. She may be a stupid woman, she has no character; and maybe there is no one to try for her, so she sits with her legs crossed, maybe she really is sick. Well, yes, everyone would turn where they should; and by the way, maybe she’s just a swindler, deliberately sending a hungry and stunted child to deceive the people, leading to illness. And what will the poor boy learn from these notes? Only his heart hardens; he walks, runs, asks. People go, but there is no time for them. Their hearts are made of stone; their words are cruel. ""Away! get out! you're naughty!"" This is what he hears from everyone, and the heart of the child hardens, and the poor, frightened boy trembles in vain in the cold, like a chick that has fallen out of a broken nest. His hands and feet are cold; the spirit is busy. Look, he's already coughing; it’s not far to wait, and the disease, like an unclean bastard, will crawl into his chest, and there, you see, death is already standing over him, somewhere in a stinking corner, without care, without help - that’s his whole life! That's what it is, life happens! Oh, Varenka, it is painful to hear for Christ's sake, and to pass by, and not give anything, to tell him: ""God will give."" Nothing else for Christ's sake. (And for the sake of Christ, there are different, matochka). Another is long, drawn out, habitual, memorized, downright beggarly; it is not yet so painful not to submit, this is a long-term beggar, long-standing, a beggar by trade, this one is used to it, you think he will overcome it and knows how to overcome it. And something else for the sake of Christ is unusual, rude, terrible - just like today, when I took a note from a boy, there was some one standing by the fence, not asking everyone, he says to me: “Give me, master, a penny for the sake of Christ! » - Yes, in such a jerky, rough voice that I shuddered from some kind of terrible feeling, but did not give a penny: it was not. And rich people do not like the poor to complain aloud about a bad lot - they say, they are disturbing, they are importunate! Yes, and always poverty is annoying - sleep, or something, interfere with their hungry moans!","Apropos of the organ-grinder, I may tell you, dearest, that today I experienced a double misfortune. As I was looking at the grinder, certain thoughts entered my head and I stood wrapped in a reverie. Some cabmen also had halted at the spot, as well as a young girl, with a yet smaller girl who was dressed in rags and tatters. These people had halted there to listen to the organ-grinder, who was playing in front of some one’s windows. Next, I caught sight of a little urchin of about ten—a boy who would have been good-looking but for the fact that his face was pinched and sickly. Almost barefooted, and clad only in a shirt, he was standing agape to listen to the music—a pitiful childish figure. Nearer to the grinder a few more urchins were dancing, but in the case of this lad his hands and feet looked numbed, and he kept biting the end of his sleeve and shivering. Also, I noticed that in his hands he had a paper of some sort. Presently a gentleman came by, and tossed the grinder a small coin, which fell straight into a box adorned with a representation of a Frenchman and some ladies. The instant he heard the rattle of the coin, the boy started, looked timidly round, and evidently made up his mind that I had thrown the money; whereupon, he ran to me with his little hands all shaking, and said in a tremulous voice as he proffered me his paper: “Pl-please sign this.” I turned over the paper, and saw that there was written on it what is usual under such circumstances. “Kind friends I am a sick mother with three hungry children. Pray help me. Though soon I shall be dead, yet, if you will not forget my little ones in this world, neither will I forget you in the world that is to come.” The thing seemed clear enough; it was a matter of life and death. Yet what was I to give the lad? Well, I gave him nothing. But my heart ached for him. I am certain that, shivering with cold though he was, and perhaps hungry, the poor lad was not lying. No, no, he was not lying. The shameful point is that so many mothers take no care of their children, but send them out, half-clad, into the cold. Perhaps this lad’s mother also was a feckless old woman, and devoid of character? Or perhaps she had no one to work for her, but was forced to sit with her legs crossed—a veritable invalid? Or perhaps she was just an old rogue who was in the habit of sending out pinched and hungry boys to deceive the public? What would such a boy learn from begging letters? His heart would soon be rendered callous, for, as he ran about begging, people would pass him by and give him nothing. Yes, their hearts would be as stone, and their replies rough and harsh. “Away with you!” they would say. “You are seeking but to trick us.” He would hear that from every one, and his heart would grow hard, and he would shiver in vain with the cold, like some poor little fledgling that has fallen out of the nest. His hands and feet would be freezing, and his breath coming with difficulty; until, look you, he would begin to cough, and disease, like an unclean parasite, would worm its way into his breast until death itself had overtaken him—overtaken him in some foetid corner whence there was no chance of escape. Yes, that is what his life would become. There are many such cases. Ah, Barbara, it is hard to hear “For Christ’s sake!” and yet pass the suppliant by and give nothing, or say merely: “May the Lord give unto you!” Of course, SOME supplications mean nothing (for supplications differ greatly in character). Occasionally supplications are long, drawn-out and drawling, stereotyped and mechanical—they are purely begging supplications. Requests of this kind it is less hard to refuse, for they are purely professional and of long standing. “The beggar is overdoing it,” one thinks to oneself. “He knows the trick too well.” But there are other supplications which voice a strange, hoarse, unaccustomed note, like that today when I took the poor boy’s paper. He had been standing by the kerbstone without speaking to anybody—save that at last to myself he said, “For the love of Christ give me a groat!” in a voice so hoarse and broken that I started, and felt a queer sensation in my heart, although I did not give him a groat. Indeed, I had not a groat on me. Rich folk dislike hearing poor people complain of their poverty. “They disturb us,” they say, “and are impertinent as well. Why should poverty be so impertinent? Why should its hungry moans prevent us from sleeping?”","I have mentioned this hurdy-gurdy man, little mother, because today I have had occasion to experience an especially keen sense of my own poverty. I had stopped to look at the hurdy-gurdy man. There were all these thoughts swarming about in my head – so, in order to divert myself, I stopped. Among the spectators, apart from myself, there were some cabbies, some prostitute or other, and a little girl who was all covered in grime. The hurdy-gurdy man had stationed himself in front of the windows of someone is house. I noticed a street-urchin, a little boy, who must have been about ten; he would have been pretty, but he looked so weak and ill; he was dressed in a shirt and not much else, and stood there practically barefoot, listening to the music open-mouthed – like the child he was! He stared in wonderment as the German is dolls danced; his own arms and legs were stiff with cold, he was shivering, and nibbling the end of one of his sleeves. I observed that he was holding a small sheet of paper in his hand. A gentleman walked by and threw the hurdy-gurdy man some coin of little value; it landed right inside the hurdy-gurdy man is box, which had a small surround on which was depicted a Frenchman dancing with some ladies. At the clink of the coin, the little boy gave a start and timidly looked round, evidently supposing that I had thrown the money. He came running up to me, his little hands trembling and his little voice quavering, held the sheet of paper out to me and said: ‘Here is a letter!’ I unfolded it. It was the usual thing: ‘ Dear Benefactor, a mother with children is dying, she has three and they are hungry, so if you will please help us, and not forget my little fledglings, when I die I will not forget you in the next world, my benefactor.’ Well, that was clear enough, there was nothing unusual about it, but what did I have to give them? So I didn’t give them anything. But how sorry I felt for him! The boy looked so wretched, he was blue with cold and probably hungry as well, and he was in earnest, oh yes, he was in earnest; I know a bit about these things. What is bad is that these scurvy mothers don’t look after their children and go sending them out with letters half-naked in cold weather like this. Perhaps she is a stupid peasant woman with no strength of character; and perhaps she has no one to go out and work for her, so she just sits cross-legged and is genuinely ill. But she could still apply in the quarters where such cases are dealt with. On the other hand, perhaps she is just a fraud, purposely sending a hungry, feeble child out to dupe people, and thereby making him ill. And what does the poor boy learn from handing out these letters? His heart merely grows hardened; he goes around, runs up to people, begging. The people are going about their business, and they have no time. Their hearts are stony; their words are cruel: ‘Be off with you! Go away! You won’t make a monkey out of me!’ That is what he hears from everyone is lips. His child is heart grows hardened, and the poor frightened boy shivers for nothing in the cold, like a little bird that has fallen out of a broken nest. His arms and legs are frozen; he gasps for breath. The next time you see him, he is coughing; it is not long before illness, like some unclean reptile, creeps into his breast, and when you look again, death is already standing over him in some stinking corner somewhere, and there is no way out, no help at hand – there you have his entire life! That is what life can be like! Oh, Varenka, it is so agonizing to hear those words ‘For the love of Christ’, and to walk on, and give the boy nothing, to say to him: ‘God will provide.’ Some ‘For the love of Christ’ are not so bad. (There are various kinds of them, little mother.) Others are long-drawn-out, habitual, studied – a beggar is stock-in-trade; it is not so hard to refrain from giving to one of those – he is an inveterate beggar, one of long standing, a beggar by trade; he’s used to it, you think , he’ll get over it, he knows how to get over it. But another will be unpractised, coarse, terrible – as today when, just as I was about to take the letter from the boy, a man standing by the fence, who was selecting the people he asked for money, said to me: ‘Give me a half-a-copeck, barin, for the love of Christ!’ in such a rude, abrupt voice that I shuddered with a sense of terrible emotion, but did not give him a half-copeck: I didn’t have one. And then again, there’s the fact that rich people don’t like the poor to complain of their lot out loud – they say they are causing trouble, being importunate! Yes, poverty is always importunate – perhaps those groans of hunger keep the rich awake!","I speak of that hurdy-gurdy, my darling, because it has happened that I have felt my poverty twice as much to-day. I stopped to look at the hurdy-gurdy man. I was in such a mood that I stopped to distract my thoughts. I was standing there, and also two cab-drivers, a woman of some sort, and a little girl, such a grubby little thing. The hurdy-gurdy man stopped before the windows of a house. I noticed a little boy about ten years old; he would have been pretty, but he looked so ill, so frail, with hardly anything but his shirt on and almost barefoot, with his mouth open; he was listening to the music—like a child! He watched the German’s dolls dancing, while his own hands and feet were numb with cold; he shivered and nibbled the edge of his sleeve. I noticed that he had a bit of paper of some sort in his hands. A gentleman passed and flung the hurdy-gurdy man some small coin, which fell straight into the box in a little garden in which the toy Frenchman was dancing with the ladies. At the clink of the coin the boy started, looked round and evidently thought that I had given the money. He ran up to me, his little hands trembling, his little voice trembling, he held the paper out to me and said, “A letter.” I opened the letter; well, it was the usual thing, saying: “Kind gentleman, a mother’s dying with three children hungry, so help us now, and as I am dying I will pray for you, my benefactor, in the next world for not forgetting my babes now.” Well, what of it?—one could see what it meant, an everyday matter, but what could I give him? Well, I gave him nothing, and how sorry I was! The boy was poor, blue with cold, perhaps hungry, too, and not lying, surely he was not lying, I know that for certain. But what is wrong is that these horrid mothers don’t take care of their children and send them out half naked in the cold to beg. Maybe she’s a weak-willed, silly woman; and there’s no one, maybe, to do anything for her, so she simply sits with her legs tucked under her, maybe she’s really ill. Well, anyway, she should apply in the proper quarter. Though, maybe, she’s a cheat and sends a hungry, delicate child out on purpose to deceive people, and makes him ill. And what sort of training is it for a poor boy? It simply hardens his heart, he runs about begging, people pass and have no time for him. Their hearts are stony, their words are cruel. “Get away, go along, you are naughty!” that is what he hears from everyone, and the child’s heart grows hard, and in vain the poor little frightened boy shivers with cold like a fledgling fallen out of a broken nest. His hands and feet are frozen, he gasps for breath. The next thing he is coughing, before long disease, like an unclean reptile, creeps into his bosom and death is standing over him in some dark corner, no help, no escape, and that’s his life! That is what life is like sometimes! Oh, Varinka, it’s wretched to hear “for Christ’s sake,” and to pass by and give nothing, telling him “God will provide.” Sometimes “for Christ’s sake” is all right (it’s not always the same, you know, Varinka) , sometimes it’s a long, drawling, habitual, practised, regular beggar’s whine; it’s not so painful to refuse one like that; he’s an old hand, a beggar by profession. He’s accustomed to it, one thinks; he can cope with it and knows how to cope with it. Sometimes “for Christ’s sake” sounds unaccustomed, rude, terrible—as to-day, when I was taking the letter from the boy, a man standing close to the fence, not begging from everyone, said to me: “Give us a halfpenny, sir, for Christ’s sake,” and in such a harsh, jerky voice that I started with a horrible feeling and did not give him a halfpenny, I hadn’t one. Rich people don’t like the poor to complain aloud of their harsh lot, they say they disturb them, they are troublesome! Yes, indeed, poverty is always troublesome; maybe their hungry groans hinder the rich from sleeping!"
"Знаете ли, что придется наконец совсем поссориться с вами? Клянусь вам, добрый Макар Алексеевич, что мне даже тяжело принимать ваши подарки. Я знаю, чего они вам стоят, каких лишений и отказов в необходимости себе самому. Сколько раз я вам говорила, что мне не нужно ничего, совершенно ничего; что я не в силах вам воздать и за те благодеяния, которыми вы доселе осыпали меня. И зачем мне эти горшки? Ну, бальзаминчики еще ничего, а геранька зачем? Одно словечко стоит неосторожно сказать, как, например, об этой герани, уж вы тотчас и купите; ведь верно, дорого? Что за прелесть на ней цветы! Пунсовые крестиками. Где это вы достали такую хорошенькую гераньку? Я ее посредине окна поставила, на самом видном месте; на полу же поставлю скамейку, а на скамейку еще цветов поставлю; вот только дайте мне самой разбогатеть! Федора не нарадуется; у нас теперь словно рай в комнате – чисто, светло! Ну, а конфеты зачем? И право, я сейчас же по письму угадала, что у вас что-нибудь да не так – и рай, и весна, и благоухания летают, и птички чирикают. Что это, я думаю, уж нет ли тут и стихов? Ведь, право, одних стихов и недостает в письме вашем, Макар Алексеевич! И ощущения нежные, и мечтания в розовом цвете – все здесь есть! Про занавеску и не думала; она, верно, сама зацепилась, когда я горшки переставляла; вот вам!","Do you know that I will finally have to quarrel with you completely? I swear to you, kind Makar Alekseevich, that it is even hard for me to accept your gifts. I know what they cost you, what hardships and denials of the need for yourself. How many times have I told you that I don't need anything, absolutely nothing; that I am unable to repay you for the good deeds with which you have hitherto showered me. And why do I need these pots? Well, balsams are still nothing, but why geraniums? One word is worth carelessly saying, as, for example, about this geranium, you will immediately buy it; right, dear? What a beauty on her flowers! Punch crosses. Where did you get such a pretty geranium? I put it in the middle of the window, in the most visible place; I will put a bench on the floor, and I will put more flowers on the bench; just let me get rich myself! Fedora is overjoyed; now it’s like heaven in our room - clean, light! Well, why candy? And really, I immediately guessed from your letter that something was wrong with you - and paradise, and spring, and fragrances fly, and birds chirp. What is this, I think, are there any poems here? After all, really, some verses are missing in your letter, Makar Alekseevich! And tender sensations, and dreams in pink color - everything is here! I didn't even think about the curtain; she probably caught herself when I rearranged the pots; there you are!","MY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,—Do you know, I must quarrel with you. Yes, good Makar Alexievitch, I really cannot accept your presents, for I know what they must have cost you—I know to what privations and self-denial they must have led. How many times have I not told you that I stand in need of NOTHING, of absolutely NOTHING, as well as that I shall never be in a position to recompense you for all the kindly acts with which you have loaded me? Why, for instance, have you sent me geraniums? A little sprig of balsam would not have mattered so much—but geraniums! Only have I to let fall an unguarded word—for example, about geraniums—and at once you buy me some! How much they must have cost you! Yet what a charm there is in them, with their flaming petals! Wherever did you get these beautiful plants? I have set them in my window as the most conspicuous place possible, while on the floor I have placed a bench for my other flowers to stand on (since you are good enough to enrich me with such presents). Unfortunately, Thedora, who, with her sweeping and polishing, makes a perfect sanctuary of my room, is not over-pleased at the arrangement. But why have you sent me also bonbons? Your letter tells me that something special is afoot with you, for I find in it so much about paradise and spring and sweet odours and the songs of birds. Surely, thought I to myself when I received it, this is as good as poetry! Indeed, verses are the only thing that your letter lacks, Makar Alexievitch. And what tender feelings I can read in it— what roseate-coloured fancies! To the curtain, however, I had never given a thought. The fact is that when I moved the flower-pots, it LOOPED ITSELF up.","Do you know that you have at last forced me into a quarrel with you? Upon my word, good Makar Alekseyevich, I find it hard to accept your presents. I know what they cost you, what deprivations and denials to yourself of the very necessities of life they involve. How many times have I told you that I need nothing, nothing at all; that I have not the wherewithal to repay you for the good deeds with which you have showered me to date. And why these pots of flowers? I mean, the balsams are all right, but why the geranium? I have only to utter one unguarded word, as for example about that geranium, and immediately you go out and buy it; yet I am sure it was expensive, was it not? What wonderful flowers it has! Crimson, like little crosses. Wherever did you get such a pretty geranium? I have put it in the centre of the window, where it may best be seen; I shall put a bench on the floor and place the rest of the flowers on the bench; just wait until I, too, grow rich! Fedora dotes upon them; our room is now like paradise – so clean and bright! But listen – why sweets as well? Indeed, I guessed at once from your letter that all was not quite right with you – all those bits about paradise, and spring, and scents wafting, and birds chirping. What’s this, I thought, it’s poetry, isn’t it? It’s true , you know: all your letter lacks is a little poetry, Makar Alekseyevich! All the rest is there: the tender feelings, the rosy-tinted dreams! About the curtain – Inever gave it any thought; I expect it must have got hitched up of itself when I was moving the pots of flowers; well I never!","Do you know I shall have to quarrel with you outright at last. I swear to you, dear Makar Alexyevitch, that it really hurts me to take your presents. I know what they cost you, how you deny yourself, and deprive yourself of what is necessary. How many times have I told you that I need nothing, absolutely nothing; that I shall never be able to repay you for the kindnesses you have showered upon me? And why have you sent me these flowers? Well, the balsams I don’t mind, but why the geranium? I have only to drop an incautious word, for instance, about that geranium, and you rush off and buy it. I am sure it must have been expensive? How charming the flowers are! Crimson, in little crosses. Where did you get such a pretty geranium? I have put it in the middle of the window in the most conspicuous place; I am putting a bench on the floor and arranging the rest of the flowers on the bench; you just wait until I get rich myself! Fedora is overjoyed; it’s like paradise now, in our room—so clean, so bright! Now, why those sweets? Upon my word, I guessed at once from your letter that there was something amiss with you—nature and spring and the sweet scents and the birds chirping. “What’s this,” I thought, “isn’t it poetry?” Yes, indeed, your letter ought to have been in verse, that was all that was wanting, Makar Alexyevitch! There are the tender sentiments and dreams in roseate hues—everything in it! As for the curtain, I never thought of it; I suppose it got hitched up of itself when I moved the flower-pots, so there!"
"День его рождения! Этот день рождения не давал мне покоя ни днем, ни ночью. Я непременно решилась напомнить о своей дружбе Покровскому и что-нибудь подарить ему. Но что? Наконец я выдумала подарить ему книг. Я знала, что ему хотелось иметь полное собрание сочинений Пушкина, в последнем издании, и я решила купить Пушкина. У меня своих собственных денег было рублей тридцать, заработанных рукодельем. Эти деньги были отложены у меня на новое платье. Тотчас я послала нашу кухарку, старуху Матрену, узнать, что стоит весь Пушкин. Беда! Цена всех одиннадцати книг, присовокупив сюда издержки на переплет, была по крайней мере рублей шестьдесят. Где взять денег? Я думала-думала и не знала, на что решиться. У матушки просить не хотелось. Конечно, матушка мне непременно бы помогла; но тогда все бы в доме узнали о нашем подарке; да к тому же этот подарок обратился бы в благодарность, в плату за целый год трудов Покровского. Мне хотелось подарить одной, тихонько от всех. А за труды его со мною я хотела быть ему навсегда одолженною без какой бы то ни было уплаты, кроме дружбы моей. Наконец я выдумала, как выйти из затруднения.","His birthday! This birthday haunted me day and night. I certainly decided to remind Pokrovsky of my friendship and give him something. But what? Finally, I thought of giving him books. I knew that he wanted to have the complete works of Pushkin, in the latest edition, and I decided to buy Pushkin. I had thirty rubles of my own money, earned by needlework. This money was set aside for a new dress. I immediately sent our cook, the old woman Matryona, to find out what all Pushkin was worth. Trouble! The price of all eleven books, adding the costs of binding, was at least sixty rubles. Where to get money? I thought and thought and did not know what to decide. Mother did not want to ask. Of course, my mother would certainly help me; but then everyone in the house would know about our gift; and besides, this gift would have turned into gratitude, as payment for a whole year of Pokrovsky's labors. I wanted to give one, quietly from everyone. And for his labors with me, I wanted to be forever indebted to him without any payment whatsoever, except for my friendship. Finally, I figured out how to get out of the difficulty.","My lover’s birthday! Thenceforward, I could not rest by night or day. Whatever might happen, it was my fixed intention to remind Pokrovski of our friendship by giving him a present. But what sort of present? Finally, I decided to give him books. I knew that he had long wanted to possess a complete set of Pushkin’s works, in the latest edition; so, I decided to buy Pushkin. My private fund consisted of thirty roubles, earned by handiwork, and designed eventually to procure me a new dress, but at once I dispatched our cook, old Matrena, to ascertain the price of such an edition. Horrors! The price of the eleven volumes, added to extra outlay upon the binding, would amount to at least SIXTY roubles! Where was the money to come from? I thought and thought, yet could not decide. I did not like to resort to my mother. Of course she would help me, but in that case every one in the house would become aware of my gift, and the gift itself would assume the guise of a recompense—of payment for Pokrovski’s labours on my behalf during the past year; whereas, I wished to present the gift ALONE, and without the knowledge of anyone. For the trouble that he had taken with me I wished to be his perpetual debtor—to make him no payment at all save my friendship. At length, I thought of a way out of the difficulty.","His birthday! That birthday gave me no peace either by day or by night. I determined to show Pokrovsky that I cared for him by giving him a present. But what? I finally had the idea of giving him some books. I knew that he wanted the complete collection of Pushkin is works in the most recent edition,* and I resolved to buy it. I had about thirty rubles of my own, earned from needlework. I had been saving this money in order to buy a dress. I immediately sent our old cook Matryona to find out what a complete Pushkin cost. Alas! The price of all eleven volumes, including the cost of the bindings, was at least sixty rubles. Where would I get the money? I racked my brains, but could not think what to do. I did not want to ask Mother. She would, of course, have helped me; but then everyone in the house would have found out about our present; what was more, the present would have turned into a token of gratitude, a kind of repayment for the year of effort Pokrovsky had devoted to me. I wanted to give him the present alone, in secret from everyone else. And for his efforts with me I wanted to be for ever in his debt, without any repayment whatsoever apart from my friendly feelings for him. At last I conceived a way out of the problem.","His birthday! That birthday gave me no rest day or night. I made up my mind to give Pokrovsky something as a sign of my affection. But what? At last I thought of giving him books. I knew he wanted to have Pushkin ’s works in the latest, complete edition,7 and I decided to buy Pushkin. I had thirty roubles of my own money earned by needlework. The money had been saved up to buy me a dress. I promptly sent old Matrona, our cook, to find out what the whole of Pushkin cost. Alas! The price of the eleven volumes, including the cost of binding, was at least sixty roubles. Where could I get the money? I thought and thought and did not know what to decide upon. I did not want to ask mother. Of course mother would have certainly helped me; but then everyone in the house would have known of our present; besides, the present would have become a token of gratitude in repayment for all that Pokrovsky had done for us during the past year. I wanted to give it alone and no one else to know of it. And for what he had done for me I wanted to be indebted to him for ever without any sort of repayment except my affection. At last I found a way out of my difficulty."
"Сегодня поутру разговорился я с Емельяном Ивановичем и с Аксентием Михайловичем об его превосходительстве. Да, Варенька, они не с одним мною так обошлись милостиво. Они не одного меня облагодетельствовали и добротою сердца своего всему свету известны. Из многих мест в честь ему хвалы воссылаются и слезы благодарности льются. У них сирота одна воспитывалась. Изволили пристроить ее: выдали за человека известного, за чиновника одного, который по особым поручениям при их же превосходительстве находился. Сына одной вдовы в какую-то канцелярию пристроили и много еще благодеяний разных оказали. Я, маточка, почел за обязанность тут же и мою лепту положить, всем во всеуслышание поступок его превосходительства рассказал; я все им рассказал и ничего не утаил. Я стыд-то в карман спрятал. Какой тут стыд, что за амбиция такая при таком обстоятельстве! Так-таки вслух – да будут славны дела его превосходительства! Я говорил увлекательно, с жаром говорил и не краснел, напротив, гордился, что пришлось такое рассказывать. Я про все рассказал (про вас только благоразумно умолчал, маточка), и про хозяйку мою, и про Фальдони, и про Ратазяева, и про сапоги, и про Маркова – все рассказал. Кое-кто там пересмеивались, да, правда, и все они пересмеивались. Только это в моей фигуре, верно, они что-нибудь смешное нашли или насчет сапогов моих – именно насчет сапогов. А с дурным каким-нибудь намерением они не могли этого сделать. Это так, молодость, или оттого, что они люди богатые, но с дурным, с злым намерением они никак не могли мою речь осмеивать. То есть что-нибудь насчет его превосходительства – этого они никак не могли сделать. Не правда ли, Варенька?","This morning I talked with Yemelyan Ivanovich and Aksenty Mikhailovich about his Excellency. Yes, Varenka, they were not the only ones who treated me so mercifully. They did not benefit me alone and are known throughout the world for the kindness of their hearts. From many places in honor of him praises are exalted and tears of gratitude flow. They brought up an orphan alone. They deigned to attach her: they gave her away as a well-known person, for an official who, on special assignments, was with their excellency. The son of a widow was placed in some kind of office and many other good deeds were rendered. I, mother, considered it an obligation to immediately put my mite in, and told everyone about His Excellency's act for all to hear; I told them everything and kept nothing back. I put my shame in my pocket. What a shame, what an ambition such under such a circumstance! So out loud - may the deeds of His Excellency be glorious! I spoke enthrallingly, spoke with ardor and did not blush, on the contrary, I was proud that I had to tell such a story. I told about everything (I only prudently kept silent about you, mother), and about my mistress, and about Faldoni, and about Ratazyaev, and about boots, and about Markov - I told everything. Some of them laughed, yes, indeed, and they all laughed. Only this is in my figure, it’s true, they found something funny either about my boots - specifically about boots. And with some bad intention, they could not do this. Is it so, youth, or because they are rich people, but with a bad, evil intention, they could not make fun of my speech. I mean, something about His Excellency—they couldn't possibly do that. Isn't that right, Varenka?","This morning I had a talk with Emelia Ivanovitch and Aksenti Michaelovitch concerning his Excellency. Apparently, I am not the only person to whom he has acted kindly and been charitable, for he is known to the whole world for his goodness of heart. In many quarters his praises are to be heard; in many quarters he has called forth tears of gratitude. Among other things, he undertook the care of an orphaned girl, and married her to an official, the son of a poor widow, and found this man place in a certain chancellory, and in other ways benefited him. Well, dearest, I considered it to be my duty to add my mite by publishing abroad the story of his Excellency’s gracious treatment of myself. Accordingly, I related the whole occurrence to my interlocutors, and concealed not a single detail. In fact, I put my pride into my pocket—though why should I feel ashamed of having been elated by such an occurrence? “Let it only be noised afield,” said I to myself, and it will resound greatly to his Excellency’s credit.—So I expressed myself enthusiastically on the subject and never faltered. On the contrary, I felt proud to have such a story to tell. I referred to every one concerned (except to yourself, of course, dearest)—to my landlady, to Phaldoni, to Rataziaev, to Markov. I even mentioned the matter of my shoes! Some of those standing by laughed—in fact every one present did so, but probably it was my own figure or the incident of my shoes—more particularly the latter—that excited merriment, for I am sure it was not meant ill-naturedly. My hearers may have been young men, or well off; certainly they cannot have been laughing with evil intent at what I had said. Anything against his Excellency CANNOT have been in their thoughts. Eh, Barbara?","This morning I was talking to Yemelyan Ivanovich and Aksenty Mikhailovich about His Excellency. You know, Varenka, I am not the only person to whom he has been so generous. I am not the only person whom he has shown such favour – he is renowned for his kindheartedness far and wide. From many quarters people sing his praises, and shed tears of gratitude. He brought up an orphan girl in his house. He made all the arrangements for her: married her off to a certain man, a government clerk who lived in His Excellency is home and did special assignments. He got the son of a certain widow a position in a government office, and has done many other benevolent deeds of a similar kind. I considered it my duty, little mother, to make my own small contribution, and I told everyone about what His Excellency had done: I told them everything and concealed nothing. I swallowed my pride. What role could a thing like pride or reputation play in a situation like that? I told it all out loud – to the glory of the doings of His Excellency! I spoke enthusiastically and with ardour, and I did not blush – on the contrary, I was proud to have the occasion to tell such a story. I described it all to them (though I was sensible enough to keep quiet about you, little mother): my landlady, Faldoni, Ratazyayev, Markov, my boots – all of it. One or two of them exchanged smiles with one another; in fact, they all exchanged a few smiles. I expect they just thought there was something ridiculous about the way I looked, or perhaps it was what I told them about my boots – yes, that must have been it. But I don’t believe they did it with any malicious intention. It was simply their youth, or the fact that they are rich; I absolutely refuse to believe that they were laughing at what I had to say with any evil or malicious intention. What I mean is that since I was saying it all in relation to His Excellency, they could not possibly have done that, could they, Varenka?","This morning I talked to Emelyan Ivanovitch and to Axentey Mihalovitch about his Excellency. Yes, Varinka, I’m not the only one he has treated so graciously. I am not the only one he has befriended, and he is known to all the world for the goodness of his heart. His praises are sung in very many quarters, and tears of gratitude are shed. An orphan girl was brought up in his house. He gave her a dowry and married her to a man in a good position, to a clerk on special commissions, who was in attendance on his Excellency. He installed a son of a widow in some office, and has done a great many other acts of kindness. I thought it my duty at that point to add my mite and described his Excellency’s action in the hearing of all; I told them all and concealed nothing. I put my pride in my pocket, as though pride or dignity mattered in a case like that. So I told it aloud—to do glory to the good deeds of his Excellency! I spoke enthusiastically, I spoke with warmth, I did not blush, on the contrary, I was proud that I had such a story to tell. I told them about everything (only I was judiciously silent about you, Varinka), about my landlady, about Faldoni, about Ratazyaev, about my boots and about Markov—I told them everything. Some of them laughed a little, in fact, they all laughed a little. Probably they found something funny in my appearance, or it may have been about my boots—yes, it must have been about my boots. They could not have done it with any bad intention. It was nothing, just youthfulness, or perhaps because they are well-to-do people, but they could not jeer at what I said with any bad, evil intention. That is, what I said about his Excellency—that they could not do. Could they, Varinka?"

"Как! Так после этого и жить себе смирно нельзя, в уголочке своем, – каков уж он там ни есть, – жить, водой не замутя, по пословице, никого не трогая, зная страх божий да себя самого, чтобы и тебя не затронули, чтобы и в твою конуру не пробрались да не подсмотрели – что, дескать, как ты себе там по-домашнему, что вот есть ли, например, у тебя жилетка хорошая, водится ли у тебя что следует из нижнего платья; есть ли сапоги, да и чем подбиты они; что ешь, что пьешь, что переписываешь?.. Да и что же тут такого, маточка, что вот хоть бы и я, где мостовая плоховата, пройду иной раз на цыпочках, что я сапоги берегу! Зачем писать про другого, что вот-де он иной раз нуждается, что чаю не пьет? А точно все и должны уж так непременно чай пить! Да разве я смотрю в рот каждому, что, дескать, какой он там кусок жует? Кого же я обижал таким образом? Нет, маточка, зачем же других обижать, когда тебя не затрогивают! ну, и вот вам пример, Варвара Алексеевна, вот что значит оно: служишь-служишь, ревностно, усердно, – чего! – и начальство само тебя уважает (уж как бы там ни было, а все-таки уважает), – и вот кто-нибудь под самым носом твоим, безо всякой видимой причины, ни с того ни с сего, испечет тебе пасквиль. Конечно, правда, иногда сошьешь себе что-нибудь новое, – радуешься, не спишь, а радуешься, сапоги новые, например, с таким сладострастием надеваешь – это правда, я ощущал, потому что приятно видеть свою ногу в тонком щегольском сапоге, – это верно описано! Но я все-таки истинно удивляюсь, как Федор-то Федорович без внимания книжку такую пропустили и за себя не вступились. Правда, что он еще молодой сановник, и любит подчас покричать; но отчего же и не покричать? Отчего же и не распечь, коли нужно нашего брата распечь. Ну да положим и так, например, для тона распечь – ну и для тона можно; нужно приучать; нужно острастку давать; потому что – между нами будь это, Варенька, – наш брат ничего без острастки не сделает, всякий норовит только где-нибудь числиться, что вот, дескать, я там-то и там-то, а от дела-то бочком да стороночкой. А так как разные чины бывают и каждый чин требует совершенно соответственной по чину распеканции, то естественно, что после этого и тон распеканции выходит разночинный, – это в порядке вещей! Да ведь на том и свет стоит, маточка, что все мы один перед другим тону задаем, что всяк из нас один другого распекает. Без этой предосторожности и свет бы не стоял и порядка бы не было. Истинно удивляюсь, как Федор Федорович такую обиду пропустили без внимания!","How! So after that, it’s impossible for oneself to live peacefully, in one’s own corner - whatever it is there - to live without muddying the water, according to the proverb, without touching anyone, knowing the fear of God and yourself, so that they don’t touch you, so that they didn’t sneak into your kennel and didn’t peep - what, they say, how do you feel at home there, what do you have, for example, do you have a good waistcoat, do you have what follows from the bottom dress; whether there are boots, and what are they lined with; what do you eat, what do you drink, what do you copy? .. And what’s the big deal, mother, that even if I, where the pavement is rather poor, sometimes walk on tiptoe, that I take care of my boots! Why write about another, that he needs it sometimes, that he does not drink tea? And it’s true that everyone should definitely drink tea! But do I really look into everyone's mouth, what, they say, what kind of piece is he chewing there? Who did I offend in this way? No, mother, why offend others when you are not affected! Well, here's an example for you, Varvara Alekseevna, that's what it means: you serve, you serve, zealously, diligently - what! - and the bosses themselves respect you (be that as it may, they still respect you), - and now someone under your very nose, for no apparent reason, for no apparent reason, will bake you a libel. Of course, it’s true, sometimes you sew something new for yourself - you rejoice, you don’t sleep, but you rejoice, you put on new boots, for example, with such voluptuousness - this is true, I felt it, because it’s nice to see your foot in a thin smart boot - this correctly described! But all the same, I am truly surprised how Fedor Fedorovich missed such a book without attention and did not stand up for himself. It is true that he is still a young dignitary and likes to shout at times; but why not scream? Why not bake it, if you need to bake our brother. Well, let's put it this way, for example, bake it for a tone - well, you can do it for a tone; need to be taught; you need to give a wit; because - if it were between us, Varenka - our brother will not do anything without wit, everyone strives only to be listed somewhere, that, they say, I am there and there, but sideways and aside from business. And since there are different ranks, and each rank requires a reprimand that is completely corresponding to the rank, it is natural that after this the tone of the reprimand comes out of different ranks - this is in the order of things! Why, the light stands on that, mother, that we all set the tone in front of the other, that each of us scolds each other. Without this precaution, the light would not stand and there would be no order. I am truly surprised how Fedor Fedorovich missed such an insult without attention!","What? In future I am not to go on living peacefully in my little corner, poor though that corner be I am not to go on living, as the proverb has it, without muddying the water, or hurting any one, or forgetting the fear of the Lord God and of oneself? I am not to see, forsooth, that no man does me an injury, or breaks into my home—I am not to take care that all shall go well with me, or that I have clothes to wear, or that my shoes do not require mending, or that I be given work to do, or that I possess sufficient meat and drink? Is it nothing that, where the pavement is rotten, I have to walk on tiptoe to save my boots? If I write to you overmuch concerning myself, is it concerning ANOTHER man, rather, that I ought to write—concerning HIS wants, concerning HIS lack of tea to drink (and all the world needs tea)? Has it ever been my custom to pry into other men’s mouths, to see what is being put into them? Have I ever been known to offend any one in that respect? No, no, beloved! Why should I desire to insult other folks when they are not molesting ME? Let me give you an example of what I mean. A man may go on slaving and slaving in the public service, and earn the respect of his superiors (for what it is worth), and then, for no visible reason at all, find himself made a fool of. Of course he may break out now and then (I am not now referring only to drunkenness), and (for example) buy himself a new pair of shoes, and take pleasure in seeing his feet looking well and smartly shod. Yes, I myself have known what it is to feel like that (I write this in good faith). Yet I am nonetheless astonished that Thedor Thedorovitch should neglect what is being said about him, and take no steps to defend himself. True, he is only a subordinate official, and sometimes loves to rate and scold; yet why should he not do so —why should he not indulge in a little vituperation when he feels like it? Suppose it to be NECESSARY, for FORM’S sake, to scold, and to set everyone right, and to shower around abuse (for, between ourselves, Barbara, our friend cannot get on WITHOUT abuse—so much so that every one humours him, and does things behind his back)? Well, since officials differ in rank, and every official demands that he shall be allowed to abuse his fellow officials in proportion to his rank, it follows that the TONE also of official abuse should become divided into ranks, and thus accord with the natural order of things. All the world is built upon the system that each one of us shall have to yield precedence to some other one, as well as to enjoy a certain power of abusing his fellows. Without such a provision the world could not get on at all, and simple chaos would ensue. Yet I am surprised that our Thedor should continue to overlook insults of the kind that he endures.","Here’s a fine to-do! After this I can’t live quietly in my own little corner any more, even though it is not up to much; now I can’t go on living ‘without muddying the water’, as the proverb has it, not troubling anyone, knowing only myself and the fear of God and not having other people troubling me, forcing their way into my hideaway and spying on me to see what my private life is like, whether I have a good waistcoat or not, or whether I have all that I ought to have in the way of underwear; whether I have boots, and what they are lined with; what I eat, what I drink, what I am copying… So what if I do sometimes walk on tiptoe in order to save my boots where the pavement’s bad, little mother? Why write about someone that he sometimes has no money, that he can’t even afford tea? As though everyone were under some kind of obligation to drink tea! Do I look into other people’s mouths to see what they’re eating? Whom have I ever insulted in that way? No, little mother, why should I offend others when they are not troubling me? Look, here is another example, Varvara Alekseyevna, this is what it boils down to: I work and work, ardently, assiduously – how else? – and the administration respects me (whatever else it may be thinking, it does respect one) – and then along comes someone who, right under one is very nose, without any provocation and for no reason in particular, writes a lampoon about me. Of course, it’s true that sometimes I do manage to get some new clothes, and then I’m delighted, I lie awake at night, overjoyed, as when I get a new pair of boots, for instance : I put them on with such voluptuous pleasure – I’ve found that to be true, it’s because it’s so good to see my leg covered by a slender, elegant boot – that’s correctly described! But I’m none the less truly surprised that Fyodor Fyodorovich should have let a book of this kind pass without sticking up for himself. It’s true that he is only a young bigwig, and likes to raise his voice at times; and why shouldn’t he? Why shouldn’t he give us a good telling-off if we need it? Suppose he does it to keep up the general tone of the place-well, that’s all right; we need to be kept on our toes, to be given a warning, because – and this is just between the two of us, Varenka – none of us will do anything without being given a warning, each one of us merely seeks to figure on this or that official list so he can say ‘I’m there, and I’m there’, just so long as he can keep to one side and avoid doing any work. And since there are various different ranks and each rank requires a completely different kind of telling-off, it is natural that the tone of the telling-off varies in rank, too – thatis in the order of things! I mean, it’s what holds the world together, little mother: that we all set the tone for one another, that each of us tells the other off. Without that precaution the world would fall apart and there would be no order anywhere. I am truly astonished that Fyodor Fyodorovich should have let such an insult pass unnoticed!","What! So now you can’t live quietly in your own little corner— whatever it may be like—not stirring up any mud, as the saying is, interfering with no one, knowing yourself, and fearing God, without people’s interfering with you, without their prying into your little den and trying to see what sort of life you lead at home, whether for instance you have a good waistcoat, whether you have all you ought to have in the way of underclothes, whether you have boots and what they are lined with; what you eat, what you drink, what you write? And what even if I do sometimes walk on tiptoe to save my boots where the pavement’s bad? Why write of another man that he sometimes goes short , that he has no tea to drink, as though everyone is always bound to drink tea—do I look into another man’s mouth to see how he chews his crust, have I ever insulted anyone in that way? No, my dear, why insult people, when they are not interfering with you! Look here, Varvara Alexyevna, this is what it comes to: you work, and work regularly and devotedly; and your superiors respect you (however things may be, they do respect you), and here under your very nose, for no apparent reason, neither with your leave nor by your leave, somebody makes a caricature of you. Of course one does sometimes get something new—and is so pleased that one lies awake thinking about it, one is so pleased, one puts on new boots for instance, with such enjoyment; that is true: I have felt it because it is pleasant to see one’s foot in a fine smart boot—that’s truly described! But I am really surprised that Fyodor Fyodorovitch should have let such a book pass without notice and without defending himself. It is true that, though he is a high official, he is young and likes at times to make his voice heard. Why shouldn’t he make his voice heard , why not give us a scolding if we need it? Scold to keep up the tone of the office, for instance—well, he must, to keep up the tone; you must teach men, you must give them a good talking to; for, between ourselves, Varinka, we clerks do nothing without a good talking to. Everyone is only on the look-out to get off somewhere, so as to say, I was sent here or there, and to avoid work and edge out of it. And as there are various grades in the service and as each grade requires a special sort of reprimand corresponding to the grade, it’s natural that the tone of the reprimand should differ in the various grades—that’s in the order of things—why, the whole world rests on that, my dear soul, on our all keeping up our authority with one another, on each one of us scolding the other. Without that precaution, the world could not go on and there would be no sort of order. I am really surprised that Fyodor Fyodorovitch let such an insult pass without attention."

Послушайте, друг мой, вы или от меня умалчиваете что-нибудь и написали мне только часть всех неприятностей ваших, или… право, Макар Алексеевич, письма ваши еще отзываются каким-то расстройством… Приходите ко мне, ради бога, приходите сегодня; да послушайте, вы знаете, уж так прямо приходите к нам обедать. Я уж и не знаю, как вы там живете и как с хозяйкой вашей уладились. Вы об этом обо всем ничего не пишете и как будто с намерением умалчиваете. Так до свидания, друг мой; заходите к нам непременно сегодня; да уж лучше бы вы сделали, если б и всегда приходили к нам обедать. Федора готовит очень хорошо. Прощайте.","I read both of your letters and gasped! Listen, my friend, you are either holding back something from me and have written me only a part of all your troubles, or ... really, Makar Alekseevich, your letters still reek of some kind of frustration ... Come to me, for God's sake, come today; Yes, listen, you know, so come directly to us for dinner. I don’t even know how you live there and how you settled down with your mistress. You do not write anything about this about everything and, as if with intent, are silent. So goodbye, my friend; visit us by all means today; Yes, it would be better if you always came to dine with us. Fedora cooks very well. Farewell.","See here, dear friend of mine.

Come today, direct from the office, and dine with us as you have done before. As to how you are living now, or as to what settlement you have made with your landlady, I know not, for you write nothing concerning those two points, and seem purposely to have left them unmentioned.

Listen, my friend: you are either hiding something from me and only telling me a part of all your unpleasant experiences, or… to be honest, Makar Alekseyevich, your letters still show the signs of a certain confusion… for goodness’ sake come and see me, come and see me today; and listen, come and have dinner with us, you know you are welcome. I do not know how you are, and whether you have patched things up with your landlady. You write nothing about all that, as if you were hiding something on purpose.

"Доложу я вам, маточка моя, Варвара Алексеевна, что спал я сию ночь добрым порядком, вопреки ожиданий, чем и весьма доволен; хотя на новых квартирах, с новоселья, и всегда как-то не спится; все что-то так, да не так! Встал я сегодня таким ясным соколом – любо-весело! Что это, какое утро сегодня хорошее, маточка! У нас растворили окошко; солнышко светит, птички чирикают, воздух дышит весенними ароматами, и вся природа оживляется – ну, и остальное там все было тоже соответственное; все в порядке, по-весеннему. Я даже и помечтал сегодня довольно приятно, и все об вас были мечтания мои, Варенька. Сравнил я вас с птичкой небесной, на утеху людям и для украшения природы созданной. Тут же подумал я, Варенька, что и мы, люди, живущие в заботе и треволнении, должны тоже завидовать беззаботному и невинному счастию небесных птиц, – ну, и остальное все такое же, сему же подобное; то есть я всё такие сравнения отдаленные делал. У меня там книжка есть одна, Варенька, так в ней то же самое, все такое же весьма подробно описано. Я к тому пишу, что ведь разные бывают мечтания, маточка. А вот теперь весна, так и мысли всё такие приятные, острые, затейливые, и мечтания приходят нежные; всё в розовом цвете. Я к тому и написал это все; а впрочем, я это все взял из книжки. Там сочинитель обнаруживает такое же желание в стишках и пишет —","I will tell you, my mother, Varvara Alekseevna, that I slept that night in good order, contrary to expectations, which I am very pleased with; although in new apartments, from housewarming, and somehow he always can’t sleep; everything is so, but not so! I got up today with such a clear falcon - it's fun! What is it, what a good morning today, mother! We have opened a window; the sun is shining, the birds are chirping, the air is breathing with spring aromas, and all nature is enlivening - well, everything else there was also appropriate; it's all right, like spring. I even dreamed rather pleasantly today, and all my dreams were about you, Varenka. I compared you with a bird of heaven, for the joy of people and for the decoration of nature created. I immediately thought, Varenka, that we, people living in care and anxiety, should also envy the carefree and innocent happiness of heavenly birds - well, everything else is the same, similar to this; that is, I made all such remote comparisons. I have one book there, Varenka, so it contains the same thing, everything is described in great detail. I am writing to that, after all, there are different dreams, mother. And now it’s spring, and so thoughts are all so pleasant, sharp, intricate, and tender dreams come; everything is in pink. That's why I wrote it all; However, I took it all from the book. There the writer discovers the same desire in rhymes and writes -","Well, next let me tell you, dearest, that last night I slept better and more soundly than I had ever hoped to do, and that I am the more delighted at the fact in that, as you know, I had just settled into a new lodging—a circumstance only too apt to keep one from sleeping! This morning, too, I arose (joyous and full of love) at cockcrow. How good seemed everything at that hour, my darling! When I opened my window I could see the sun shining, and hear the birds singing, and smell the air laden with scents of spring. In short, all nature was awaking to life again. Everything was in consonance with my mood; everything seemed fair and spring-like. Moreover, I had a fancy that I should fare well today. But my whole thoughts were bent upon you. “Surely,” thought I, “we mortals who dwell in pain and sorrow might with reason envy the birds of heaven which know not either!” And my other thoughts were similar to these. In short, I gave myself up to fantastic comparisons. A little book which I have says the same kind of thing in a variety of ways. For instance, it says that one may have many, many fancies, my Barbara—that as soon as the spring comes on, one’s thoughts become uniformly pleasant and sportive and witty, for the reason that, at that season, the mind inclines readily to tenderness, and the world takes on a more roseate hue. From that little book of mine I have culled the following passage, and written it down for you to see. In particular does the author express a longing similar to my own, where he writes:","I am able to report to you, Varvara Alekseyevna, my little mother, that last night, contrary to expectation, I slept in regular order and am accordingly most satisfied; it is always difficult to sleep in new lodgings one has just moved into; there is always something that is not quite right. I rose this morning as fresh as a daisy – happy and cheerful! What a wonderful morning it was, my dear. Our window had been opened; the sun was shining, the birds were chirruping, the scents of spring were wafting on the air, and all nature was wakening to life – well, and everything else was likewise in corresponding manner; everything was in order, spring-fashion. I even had some rather nice dreams today, and they were all about you, Varenka. I compared you to a bird of the air, made for the delight of human beings and as an ornament for nature. It suddenly occurred to me, Varenka, that we human beings who live in care and trouble ought to envy the carefree and innocent happiness of the birds of the air – well, and so on, and so forth; i.e., I continued to make similar far-fetched comparisons. I have a book here, Varenka, which says the same sort of thing – all described in the greatest detail. I am writing this to you, little mother, because I have so many different dreams. And also because it’s spring now: one’s thoughts are pleasant, witty, fanciful, and one has such tender dreams; everything bears a rosy tinge. That’s why I’ve written all this; though in fact I got it all out of my book. There the author displays the same desire in verses, and writes:","I beg to inform you, Varvara Alexyevna, my dear, that I slept last night excellently, contrary to my expectations, at which I am very much pleased; though in new lodgings, after moving, it is always difficult to sleep; there is always some little thing amiss. I got up this morning as gay as a lark! What a fine morning it was, my darling! Our window was opened; the sun shone so brightly; the birds were chirping; the air was full of the scents of spring and all nature seemed coming back to life—and everything else was to correspond; everything was right, to fit the spring. I even had rather pleasant dreams to-day, and my dreams were all of you, Varinka. I compared you with a bird of the air created for the delight of men and the adornment of nature. Then I thought, Varinka, that we men, living in care and anxiety, must envy the careless and innocent happiness of the birds of the air—and more of the same sort, like that; that is, I went on making such far-fetched comparisons. I have a book, Varinka, and there is the same thought in it, all very exactly described. I write this, my darling, because one has all sorts of dreams, you know. And now it’s springtime, so one’s thoughts are always so pleasant; witty, amusing, and tender dreams visit one; everything is in a rosy light. That is why I have written all this; though, indeed, I took it all out of the book. The author there expresses the same desire in verse and writes:"
"Перед рассветом старик, усталый от душевной боли, заснул на своей рогожке как убитый. В восьмом часу сын стал умирать; я разбудила отца. Покровский был в полной памяти и простился со всеми нами. Чудно! Я не могла плакать; но душа моя разрывалась на части.","Before dawn, the old man, tired from mental pain, fell asleep on his matting as if dead. At the eighth hour the son began to die; I woke up my father. Pokrovsky was in full memory and said goodbye to all of us. Wonderful! I couldn't cry; but my soul was torn to pieces.","Just before dawn he succumbed to the stress of mental agony, and fell asleep on his mattress like a man who has been beaten; but by eight o’clock the son was at the point of death, and I ran to wake the father. The dying man was quite conscious, and bid us all farewell. Somehow I could not weep, though my heart seemed to be breaking.","Towards dawn, worn out by mental agony, the old man fell into an inert torpor. At some time between seven and eight in the morning the son’s death throes began; I woke the father. Pokrovsky was fully conscious, and said farewell to all of us. It was strange; I could not weep, but my soul was torn to pieces.","Just before dawn the old man, worn out with mental suffering, fell asleep on his mat and slept like the dead. Between seven and eight his son began to die. I waked the father. Pokrovsky was fully conscious and said good-bye to us all. Strange! I could not cry, but my heart was torn to pieces."
"Несколько дней спустя матушка вдруг сделалась опасно больна. Она уже два дня не вставала с постели и на третью ночь была в жару и в бреду. Я уже не спала одну ночь, ухаживая за матушкой, сидела у ее кровати, подносила ей питье и давала в определенные часы лекарства. На вторую ночь я измучилась совершенно. По временам меня клонил сон, в глазах зеленело, голова шла кругом, и я каждую минуту готова была упасть от утомления, но слабые стоны матери пробуждали меня, я вздрагивала, просыпалась на мгновение, а потом дремота опять одолевала меня. Я мучилась. Я не знаю – я не могу припомнить себе, – но какой-то страшный сон, какое-то ужасное видение посетило мою расстроенную голову в томительную минуту борьбы сна с бдением. Я проснулась в ужасе. В комнате было темно, ночник погасал, полосы света то вдруг обливали всю комнату, то чуть-чуть мелькали по стене, то исчезали совсем. Мне стало отчего-то страшно, какой-то ужас напал на меня; воображение мое взволновано было ужасным сном; тоска сдавила мое сердце… Я вскочила со стула и невольно вскрикнула от какого-то мучительного, страшно тягостного чувства. В это время отворилась дверь, и Покровский вошел к нам в комнату.","A few days later my mother suddenly became dangerously ill. She had not left her bed for two days, and on the third night she was feverish and delirious. I did not sleep one night, taking care of my mother, I sat by her bed, brought her drinks and gave her medicines at certain hours. On the second night, I was completely exhausted. From time to time I was driven to sleep, my eyes turned green, my head was spinning, and every minute I was ready to fall from exhaustion, but the weak moans of my mother awakened me, I shuddered, woke up for a moment, and then drowsiness again overcame me. I suffered. I don't know—I can't recall to myself—but some kind of terrible dream, some kind of terrible vision visited my upset head at the agonizing moment of the struggle between sleep and wakefulness. I woke up horrified. It was dark in the room, the night-light was going out, streaks of light either suddenly poured over the whole room, then flickered a little along the wall, then disappeared altogether. For some reason I felt frightened, some kind of horror attacked me; my imagination was excited by a terrible dream; melancholy squeezed my heart ... I jumped up from my chair and involuntarily cried out from some painful, terribly painful feeling. At that moment the door opened and Pokrovsky entered our room.","A few days later, my mother suddenly fell dangerously ill. For two days past she had not left her bed, while during the third night of her illness she became seized with fever and delirium. I also had not closed my eyes during the previous night, but now waited upon my mother, sat by her bed, brought her drink at intervals, and gave her medicine at duly appointed hours. The next night I suffered terribly. Every now and then sleep would cause me to nod, and objects grow dim before my eyes. Also, my head was turning dizzy, and I could have fainted for very weariness. Yet always my mother’s feeble moans recalled me to myself as I started, momentarily awoke, and then again felt drowsiness overcoming me. What torture it was! I do not know, I cannot clearly remember, but I think that, during a moment when wakefulness was thus contending with slumber, a strange dream, a horrible vision, visited my overwrought brain, and I awoke in terror. The room was nearly in darkness, for the candle was flickering, and throwing stray beams of light which suddenly illuminated the room, danced for a moment on the walls, and then disappeared. Somehow I felt afraid—a sort of horror had come upon me— my imagination had been over-excited by the evil dream which I had experienced, and a feeling of oppression was crushing my heart.... I leapt from the chair, and involuntarily uttered a cry—a cry wrung from me by the terrible, torturing sensation that was upon me. Presently the door opened, and Pokrovski entered.","A few days later Mother suddenly fell dangerously ill. She lay in bed for two days, and on the third night she developed a fever and delirium. I had already lost one night of sleep looking after her, sitting by her bedside, bringing her water to drink and giving her her medicine at the prescribed times. By the second night I was completely exhausted. At times sleep overcame me, my eyes went dark, my head grew dizzy, and I was constantly on the point of collapsing with weariness; but Mother’s feeble groaning kept rousing me, and I would start and wake up for a moment before slumber once again got the better of me. I was in torment. I do not know how it was – I cannot remember – but at the agonizing moment of sleep’s struggle with wakefulness a terrible vision, a monstrous dream visited my confused head. I woke up in horror. The room was in darkness, the night-light was going out; suddenly the whole room was bathed in stripes of light, which at one moment flashed across the wall and at the next disappeared entirely. For some reason I grew dreadfully afraid, I was attacked by a sense of horror; my fantasy had been aroused by the terrible dream I had had; anguish constricted my heart… I leapt up from my chair and let out an involuntary shriek, brought on by my sense of claustrophobic, agonized terror. At that moment the door opened, and Pokrovsky came into our room.","A few days later mother suddenly became dangerously ill. After two days in bed, on the third night, she was feverish and delirious.

At times I was overcome with sleep, my head went round and everything was green before my eyes. I was ready any minute to drop with fatigue, but mother’s weak moans roused me, I started up, waked for an instant and then was overwhelmed with drowsiness again. I was in torment.

"Сначала, покамест еще мы, то есть я и матушка, не обжились на нашем новоселье, нам обеим было как-то жутко, дико у Анны Федоровны. Анна Федоровна жила в собственном доме, в Шестой линии. В доме всего было пять чистых комнат. В трех из них жила Анна Федоровна и двоюродная сестра моя, Саша, которая у ней воспитывалась, – ребенок, сиротка, без отца и матери. Потом в одной комнате жили мы, и, наконец, в последней комнате, рядом с нами, помещался один бедный студент Покровский, жилец у Анны Федоровны. Анна Федоровна жила очень хорошо, богаче, чем бы можно было предполагать; но состояние ее было загадочно, так же как и ее занятия. Она всегда суетилась, всегда была озабочена, выезжала и выходила по нескольку раз в день; но что она делала, о чем заботилась и для чего заботилась, этого я никак не могла угадать. Знакомство у ней было большое и разнообразное. К ней все, бывало, гости ездили, и все бог знает какие люди, всегда по каким-то делам и на минутку. Матушка всегда уводила меня в нашу комнату, бывало, только что зазвенит колокольчик. Анна Федоровна ужасно сердилась за это на матушку и беспрерывно твердила, что уж мы слишком горды, что не по силам горды, что было бы еще чем гордиться, и по целым часам не умолкала. Я не понимала тогда этих упреков в гордости; точно так же я только теперь узнала или по крайней мере предугадываю, почему матушка не решалась жить у Анны Федоровны. Злая женщина была Анна Федоровна; она беспрерывно нас мучила. До сих пор для меня тайна, зачем именно она приглашала нас к себе? Сначала она была с нами довольно ласкова, – а потом уж и выказала свой настоящий характер вполне, как увидала, что мы совершенно беспомощны и что нам идти некуда. Впоследствии со мной она сделалась весьма ласкова, даже как-то грубо ласкова, до лести, но сначала и я терпела заодно с матушкой. Поминутно попрекала она нас; только и делала, что твердила о своих благодеяниях. Посторонним людям рекомендовала нас как своих бедных родственниц, вдовицу и сироту беспомощных, которых она из милости, ради любви христианской, у себя приютила. За столом каждый кусок, который мы брали, следила глазами, а если мы не ели, так опять начиналась история: дескать, мы гнушаемся; не взыщите, чем богата, тем и рада; было ли бы еще у нас самих лучше. Батюшку поминутно бранила: говорила, что лучше других хотел быть, да худо и вышло; дескать, жену с дочерью пустил по миру, и что не нашлось бы родственницы благодетельной, христианской души, сострадательной, так еще бог знает пришлось бы, может быть, среди улицы с голоду сгнить. Чего-чего она не говорила! Не так горько, как отвратительно было ее слушать. Матушка поминутно плакала; здоровье ее становилось день от дня хуже, она видимо чахла, а между тем мы с нею работали с утра до ночи, доставали заказную работу, шили, что очень не нравилось Анне Федоровне; она поминутно говорила, что у нее не модный магазин в доме. Но нужно было одеваться, нужно было на непредвидимые расходы откладывать, нужно было непременно свои деньги иметь. Мы на всякий случай копили, надеялись, что можно будет со временем переехать куда-нибудь. Но матушка последнее здоровье свое потеряла на работе: она слабела с каждым днем. Болезнь, как червь, видимо подтачивала жизнь ее и близила к гробу. Я все видела, все чувствовала, все выстрадала; все это было на глазах моих!","At first, while we, that is, my mother and I, did not settle down at our housewarming party, we both felt somehow terribly, wildly at Anna Fyodorovna's. Anna Fedorovna lived in her own house, in the Sixth Line. There were five clean rooms in the house. Anna Feodorovna and my cousin, Sasha, who was brought up by her, lived in three of them - a child, an orphan, without a father and mother. Then we lived in the same room, and finally, in the last room, next to us, there was a poor student, Pokrovsky, who lived with Anna Fedorovna. Anna Fedorovna lived very well, richer than one might have imagined; but her condition was mysterious, as were her occupations. She was always fussy, always preoccupied, went out and went out several times a day; but what she did, what she cared about, and why she cared, I could never guess. Her acquaintance was wide and varied. Everyone used to visit her, guests went, and God knows what kind of people, always on some business and for a minute. Mother always took me to our room, it used to be that the bell would just ring. Anna Fyodorovna was terribly angry with her mother for this and kept repeating that we were too proud, that we were too proud, that there would be more to be proud of, and for whole hours she did not stop. I did not understand then these accusations of pride; in the same way, I have only now found out, or at least I foresee why my mother did not dare to live with Anna Fyodorovna. The evil woman was Anna Feodorovna; she constantly tormented us. It is still a mystery to me, why exactly did she invite us to her place? At first she was quite affectionate with us - and then she showed her real character completely, when she saw that we were completely helpless and that we had nowhere to go. Subsequently, she became very affectionate with me, even somehow rudely affectionate, to the point of flattery, but at first I suffered along with my mother. Every minute she reproached us; All she did was talk about her good deeds. She recommended us to strangers as her poor relatives, the helpless widow and orphan, whom she, out of mercy, for the sake of Christian love, sheltered. At the table, every piece that we took was followed by our eyes, and if we did not eat, the story began again: they say, we shun; do not seek, what is rich, so glad; would it be better for us. She scolded the priest every minute: she said that she wanted to be better than others, but it turned out badly; they say, he let his wife and daughter go around the world, and that if there weren’t a relative of a benevolent, compassionate Christian soul, then God knows, maybe they would have to rot in the street with hunger. What didn't she say! Not as bitter as it was disgusting to listen to her. Mother was crying every minute; her health was getting worse day by day, she was apparently withering, and meanwhile we worked with her from morning to night, getting custom work, sewing, which Anna Fyodorovna did not like very much; she kept saying that she did not have a fashion store in the house. But it was necessary to dress, it was necessary to put aside for unforeseen expenses, it was imperative to have your own money. Just in case, we saved up, hoping that in time it would be possible to move somewhere. But mother lost her last health at work: she was weakening every day. The disease, like a worm, apparently undermined her life and brought her closer to the grave. I saw everything, felt everything, suffered everything; All this was in front of my eyes!","AT first—that is to say, until my mother and myself grew used to our new abode—we found living at Anna Thedorovna’s both strange and disagreeable. The house was her own, and contained five rooms, three of which she shared with my orphaned cousin, Sasha (whom she had brought up from babyhood); a fourth was occupied by my mother and myself; and the fifth was rented of Anna by a poor student named Pokrovski. Although Anna lived in good style—in far better style than might have been expected—her means and her avocation were conjectural. Never was she at rest; never was she not busy with some mysterious something or other. Also, she possessed a wide and varied circle of friends. The stream of callers was perpetual—although God only knows who they were, or what their business was. No sooner did my mother hear the door-bell ring than off she would carry me to our own apartment. This greatly displeased Anna, who used again and again to assure my mother that we were too proud for our station in life. In fact, she would sulk for hours about it. At the time I could not understand these reproaches, and it was not until long afterwards that I learned—or rather , I guessed—why eventually my mother declared that she could not go on living with Anna. Yes, Anna was a bad woman. Never did she let us alone. As to the exact motive why she had asked us to come and share her house with her I am still in the dark. At first she was not altogether unkind to us but, later, she revealed to us her real character—as soon, that is to say, as she saw that we were at her mercy, and had nowhere else to go. Yes, in early days she was quite kind to me— even offensively so, but afterwards, I had to suffer as much as my mother. Constantly did Anna reproach us; constantly did she remind us of her benefactions, and introduce us to her friends as poor relatives of hers whom, out of goodness of heart and for the love of Christ, she had received into her bosom. At table, also, she would watch every mouthful that we took; and, if our appetite failed, immediately she would begin as before, and reiterate that we were over-dainty, that we must not assume that riches would mean happiness, and that we had better go and live by ourselves. Moreover, she never ceased to inveigh against my father—saying that he had sought to be better than other people, and thereby had brought himself to a bad end; that he had left his wife and daughter destitute; and that, but for the fact that we had happened to meet with a kind and sympathetic Christian soul, God alone knew where we should have laid our heads, save in the street. What did that woman not say? To hear her was not so much galling as disgusting. From time to time my mother would burst into tears, her health grew worse from day to day, and her body was becoming sheer skin and bone. All the while, too, we had to work—to work from morning till night, for we had contrived to obtain some employment as occasional sempstresses. This, however, did not please Anna, who used to tell us that there was no room in her house for a modiste’s establishment. Yet we had to get clothes to wear, to provide for unforeseen expenses, and to have a little money at our disposal in case we should some day wish to remove elsewhere. Unfortunately, the strain undermined my mother’s health, and she became gradually weaker. Sickness, like a cankerworm, was gnawing at her life, and dragging her towards the tomb. Well could I see what she was enduring, what she was suffering. Yes, it all lay open to my eyes.","Initially, until we – Mother and I, that is – had grown accustomed to our new abode, we both found life in Anna Fyodorovna’s house a strange and in some ways terrifying experience. Anna Fyodorovna lived in a house of her own on the Sixth Line. There were only five habitable rooms in the house. Three of them were occupied by Anna Fyodorovna and my female cousin Sasha, whom she was bringing up – Sasha was just a child, an orphan who had no father or mother. We lived in one of the remaining rooms, and the other, next to ours, housed a poor student named Pokrovsky, Anna Fyodorovna’s lodger. Anna Fyodorovna lived very well, better than one might have supposed; but the sources of her capital were mysterious, as were the tasks that kept her busy. She was always bustling about, always preoccupied; went out by carriage or on foot several times a day; but what she did, what preoccupied her and why, I was never able to fathom. The circle of her acquaintances was large and varied. She had a constant stream of visitors, and Lord only knows what kind of people they were, always calling on some sort of business and only for a moment or two. Mother would always take me off to our room as soon as the doorbell rang. Anna Fyodorovna was always terribly angry with Mother because of this, and was forever saying that we were too proud, proud beyond our means, and that it would be a matter if we had something to be proud about, and kept going on like that for whole hours on end. At that time I did not understand these accusations of pride; it is only now that I think I know, or can at least surmise, why Mother was unable to make up her mind to go and live in Anna Fyodorovna’s house. Anna Fyodorovna was a malicious woman; she tormented us constantly. It is to this day a mystery to me why she invited us to go and live with her. At the outset she was reasonably pleasant to us, but then, when she realized that we were helpless and had nowhere to go, she displayed her true colours. Later on she became quite affectionate towards me, affectionate in a vulgar sort of way that verged on flattery, but initially I had to put up with everything that Mother had to put up with. She was on at us every minute of the day; all she ever did was remind us that she was our benefactress. She would introduce us to strangers as her poor relatives, a helpless widow and orphan whom she had given shelter in her home out of mercy, for the sake of Christian charity. At table she would watch every mouthful we took, but if we did not eat, there would be more trouble: she would say that we were turning up our noses at what she offered us, that it was not good enough for us, that we were ungrateful. She constantly criticized Father, saying that he had wanted to be better than other people, and a fat lot of good that had done him; he had left his wife and daughter to sink or swim, and if they had not had a female relative with a charitable, compassionate, Christian soul, they might, God only knew, have perished of hunger on the street. The things she said! Listening to her, one felt less bitterness than revulsion. Mother was constantly in tears; her health was getting worse from day to day, she was visibly wasting away, yet all the while she and I were working from morning to night, taking in orders for sewing, which thoroughly displeased Anna Fyodorovna; she kept repeating that her home was not a fashion shop. But we had to clothe ourselves, we had to put money by for unforeseeable expenses, we simply had to have money of our own. We were saving just in case it proved possible to move somewhere else in time. But doing the work, Mother lost what little good health she had left: she was growing weaker with each day that passed. Her illness, like a canker, was visibly undermining her life and was bringing her close to the grave. I saw it all, felt it all, suffered it all: it was all happening before my eyes!","AT FIRST TILL WE—that is mother and I—had grown used to our new home we both felt strange and miserable at Anna Fyodorovna’s. Anna Fyodorovna lived in a house of her own in Sixth Row. There were only five living-rooms in the house. In three of them lived Anna Fyodorovna and my cousin Sasha, a child who was being brought up by her, an orphan, fatherless and motherless. Then we lived in one room, and in the last room, next to ours, there was a poor student called Pokrovsky who was lodging in the house. Anna Fyodorovna lived very well, in a more wealthy style than one could have expected; but her fortune was mysterious and so were her pursuits. She was always in a bustle, was always full of business, she drove out and came back several times a day; but what she was doing, what she was in a fuss about and with what object she was busy I could never make out. She had a large and varied circle of acquaintances. Visitors were always calling upon her, and the queerest people, always on business of some sort and to see her for a minute. Mother always carried me off to my room as soon as the bell rang. Anna Fyodorovna was horribly vexed with mother for this and was continually repeating that we were too proud, that we were proud beyond our means, that we had nothing to be proud about, and she would go on like that for hours together. I did not understand these reproaches at the time and, in fact, it is only now that I have found out, or rather that I guess why mother could not make up her mind to live with Anna Fyodorovna. Anna Fyodorovna was a spiteful woman, she was continually tormenting us. To this day it is a mystery to me why it was she invited us to live with her. At first she was fairly nice to us, but afterwards she began to show her real character as soon as she saw we were utterly helpless and had nowhere else to go. Later on she became very affectionate to me, even rather coarsely affectionate and flattering, but at first I suffered in the same way as mother. Every minute she was upbraiding us, she did nothing but talk of her charitable deeds. She introduced us to outsiders as her poor relations—a helpless widow and orphan to whom in the kindness of her heart, out of Christian charity, she had given a home. At meals she watched every morsel we took, while if we did not eat, there would be a fuss again; she would say we were fastidious, that we should not be over-nice, that we should be thankful for what we had; that she doubted if we had had anything better in our own home. She was continually abusing father, saying that he wanted to be better than other people and much good that had done him; that he had left his wife and daughter penniless and that if they had not had a benevolent relation, a Christian soul with a feeling heart, then, God knows, they might have been rotting in the street and dying of hunger. What did she not say! It was not so much painful as disgusting to hear her. Mother was continually crying; her health grew worse from day to day. She was visibly wasting, yet she and I worked from morning till night, taking in sewing, which Anna Fyodorovna very much disliked, she was continually saying that she was not going to have her house turned into a dressmaker’s shop. But we had to have clothes; we had to lay by for unforeseen expenses; it was absolutely necessary to have money of our own. We saved on the off-chance, hoping we might be able in time to move elsewhere. But mother lost what little health was left her over work; she grew weaker every day. The disease sucked the life out of her like a worm and hurried her to the grave. I saw it all, I felt it all, I realised it all and suffered; it all went on before my eyes."

Да, это так, Варенька, это так; Быков поступил благородно; только вот видите ли, родная моя, так вы и соглашаетесь. Конечно, во всем воля божия; это так, это непременно должно быть так, то есть тут воля-то божия непременно должна быть; и промысл творца небесного, конечно, и благ и неисповедим, и судьбы тоже, и они то же самое. Федора тоже в вас участие принимает. Конечно, вы счастливы теперь будете, маточка, в довольстве будете, моя голубочка, ясочка моя, ненаглядная вы моя, ангельчик мой, – только вот видите ли, Варенька, как же это так скоро?.. Да, дела… у господина Быкова есть дела – конечно, у кого нет дел, и у него тоже они могут случиться… видел я его, как он от вас выходил. Видный, видный мужчина; даже уж и очень видный мужчина. Только все это как-то не так, дело-то не в том именно, что он видный мужчина, да я-то теперь как-то сам не свой. Только вот как же мы будем теперь письма-то друг к другу писать? Я-то, я-то как же один останусь? Я, ангельчик мой, все взвешиваю, все взвешиваю, как вы писали-то мне там, в сердце-то моем все это взвешиваю, причины-то эти. Я уже двадцатый лист оканчивал переписывать, а между тем эти происшествия-то нашли! Маточка, ведь вот вы едете, так и закупки-то вам различные сделать нужно, башмачки разные, платьице, а вот у меня кстати и магазин есть знакомый в Гороховой; помните, как я вам еще его все описывал. Да нет же! Как же вы, маточка, что вы! ведь вам нельзя теперь ехать, совершенно невозможно, никак невозможно. Ведь вам нужно покупки большие делать, да и экипаж заводить. К тому же и погода теперь дурная; вы посмотрите-ка, дождь как из ведра льет, и такой мокрый дождь, да еще… еще то, что вам холодно будет, мой ангельчик; сердечку-то вашему будет холодно! Ведь вот вы боитесь чужого человека, а едете. А я-то на кого здесь один останусь? Да вот Федора говорит, что вас счастие ожидает большое… да ведь она баба буйная и меня погубить желает. Пойдете ли вы ко всенощной сегодня, маточка? Я бы вас пошел посмотреть. Оно правда, маточка, совершенная правда, что вы девица ученая, добродетельная и чувствительная, только пусть уж он лучше женится на купчихе! Как вы думаете, маточка? пусть уж лучше на купчихе-то женится! Я к вам, Варенька вы моя, как смеркнется, так и забегу на часок. Нынче ведь рано смеркается, так я и забегу. Я, маточка, к вам непременно на часочек приду сегодня. Вот вы теперь ждете Быкова, а как он уйдет, так тогда… Вот подождите, маточка, я забегу…","I, mother, hasten to answer you; I, mother, hasten to announce to you that I am amazed. All this is somehow wrong ... Yesterday we buried Gorshkov. Yes, that's right, Varenka, that's right; Bykov acted nobly; but you see, my dear, so you agree. Of course, everything is the will of God; this is so, it must certainly be so, that is, the will of God must certainly be here; and the providence of the creator of heaven, of course, is good and inscrutable, and fate too, and they are the same. Fedora also takes part in you. Of course, you will be happy now, mother, you will be content, my dove, my little darling, you are my beloved, my angel - but you see, Varenka, how is it so soon? .. Yes, things ... Mr. Bykov has deeds - of course, whoever has no deeds, and they can also happen to him ... I saw him, how he left you. Prominent, prominent man; even a very prominent man. Only all this is somehow wrong, the point is not precisely that he is a prominent man, but now I am somehow not myself. But how are we going to write letters to each other now? I, how can I be left alone? I, my angel, weigh everything, weigh everything, as you wrote to me there, in my heart I weigh it all, these are the reasons. I have already finished copying the twentieth sheet, but meanwhile these incidents have been found! Mother, after all, here you are, you need to make various purchases, different shoes, a dress, but by the way, I have a store I know in Gorokhovaya; remember how I described it to you. No! How are you, mother, what are you! you can't go now, it's absolutely impossible, absolutely impossible. After all, you need to make big purchases, and start a crew. Besides, the weather is now bad; just look, the rain is pouring like buckets, and such a wet rain, and moreover ... that you will be cold, my angel; your heart will be cold! After all, here you are afraid of a stranger, but you are going. And who am I to stay here alone? Yes, Fedora says that great happiness awaits you ... but she is a violent woman and wants to ruin me. Will you go to the vigil today, mother? I would go see you. It is true, little mother, absolutely true, that you are a learned, virtuous and sensitive girl, only let him marry a merchant's wife! What do you think, mother? let him marry a merchant! I’m coming to you, Varenka, you’re mine, as soon as it gets dark, I’ll run for an hour. It's getting dark early tonight, so I'll run. I, mother, will certainly come to you for an hour today. Now you are waiting for Bykov, and as soon as he leaves, then ... Just wait, mother, I will run ...","MY BELOVED BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,—I hasten to reply to you—I hasten to express to you my extreme astonishment.... In passing, I may mention that yesterday we buried poor Gorshkov.... Yes, Bwikov has acted nobly, and you have no choice but to accept him. All things are in God’s hands. This is so, and must always be so; and the purposes of the Divine Creator are at once good and inscrutable, as also is Fate, which is one with Him... Thedora will share your happiness—for, of course, you will be happy, and free from want, darling, dearest, sweetest of angels! But why should the matter be so hurried? Oh, of course—Monsieur Bwikov’s business affairs. Only a man who has no affairs to see to can afford to disregard such things. I got a glimpse of Monsieur Bwikov as he was leaving your door. He is a fine-looking man—a very fine-looking man; though that is not the point that I should most have noticed had I been quite myself at the time.... In the future shall we be able to write letters to one another? I keep wondering and wondering what has led you to say all that you have said. To think that just when twenty pages of my copying are completed THIS has happened!... I suppose you will be able to make many purchases now—to buy shoes and dresses and all sorts of things? Do you remember the shops in Gorokhovaia Street of which I used to speak?... But no. You ought not to go out at present—you simply ought not to, and shall not. Presently, you will he able to buy many, many things, and to, keep a carriage. Also, at present the weather is bad. Rain is descending in pailfuls, and it is such a soaking kind of rain that—that you might catch cold from it, my darling, and the chill might go to your heart. Why should your fear of this man lead you to take such risks when all the time I am here to do your bidding? So Thedora declares great happiness to be awaiting you, does she? She is a gossiping old woman, and evidently desires to ruin you. Shall you be at the all-night Mass this evening, dearest? I should like to come and see you there. Yes, Bwikov spoke but the truth when he said that you are a woman of virtue, wit, and good feeling. Yet I think he would do far better to marry the merchant’s daughter. What think YOU about it? Yes, ‘twould be far better for him. As soon as it grows dark tonight I mean to come and sit with you for an hour. Tonight twilight will close in early, so I shall soon be with you. Yes, come what may, I mean to see you for an hour. At present, I suppose, you are expecting Bwikov, but I will come as soon as he has gone. So stay at home until I have arrived, dearest.","I hasten to reply to you, little mother; I hasten to tell you, little mother, that I am amazed. This is somehow all wrong… We buried Gorshkov yesterday. Yes, it is right, Varenka, it is right; Bykov has acted honourably; only you are agreeing to his proposal, my darling. Of course, God is will’s in all things; it is right , it must unquestionably be right – that is to say, God’s will must be in this; and the providence of the Heavenly Creator is, of course, blessed and unfathomable, and human fates, too – they are the same. And you have the sympathy of Fedora, too. Of course, now you will be happy, little mother, you will have a sufficiency of everything, my little dove, my little treasure, my beloved, my little angel – only Varenka, why are you doing it so quickly?… Yes, business… Mr Bykov has business to attend to – of course, who hasn’t? he is just as likely to have business to attend to as the next person … I saw him as he was leaving the house after seeing you. He’s a fine figure of a man, a fine figure of a man; even a very fine figure of a man. It’s just that it somehow seems all wrong, it’s not really to do with his being a fine figure of a man but rather with the fact that I’m not myself now. It’s just that how are we going to write letters to each other now? And I, how am I going to manage alone? My little angel, I’m weighing it all over, all of what you have written to me in your letter; I am weighing them all over in my heart, the reasons you give. I had just finished copying the twentieth printer’s sheet, and all the while these happenings had been taking place! Little mother, I mean, here you are setting off on a journey – you’ll need to buy various items, like shoes and a dress, and it just so happens that I know of a shop in Gorokhovaya Street ; you remember the one – I described it to you before. But no! How can you, little mother, what are you thinking of? I mean, you can’t go just now – it’s quite impossible, quite out of the question. I mean, you will need to do a great deal of shopping and arrange for a carriage. What’s more, the weather is bad just now; just look out of your window – the rain’s simply pouring down, and it’s such a wetting rain, and you’ll… you’ll get so cold, my little angel; your little heart will get cold! I mean, you’re afraid of strangers, yet here you are setting off with this man. And who will I have once you are gone? I know that Fedora says that great happiness awaits you… but she’s an ungovernable woman and she wants to ruin me. Will you be at the all-night service tonight, little mother? I would go merely in order to look at you. It’s true, little mother, it’s perfectly true that you’re an educated woman, virtuous and sensitive – it’s just that he’d do better to marry the merchant’s daughter! What do you think, little mother? Don’t you think that’s what he ought to do? As soon as it gets dark I shall look in and see you for a little while, my Varenka. It’s getting dark early today, and I shall look in. Little mother, I shall come and see you for a little while today without fail. You’ll be waiting for Bykov to arrive now, but when he leaves, then… Just wait, little mother, and I shall look in…","I hasten to answer you, my dear; I hasten to tell you, my precious, that I am dumbfounded. It all seems so ... Yesterday we buried Gorshkov. Yes, that is so, Varinka, that is so; Bykov has behaved honourably; only, you see, my own ... so you have consented. Of course, everything is according to God’s will; that is so, that certainly must be so— that is, it certainly must be God’s will in this; and the providence of the Heavenly Creator is blessed, of course, and inscrutable, and it is fate too, and they are the same. Fedora sympathises with you too. Of course you will be happy now, my precious, you will live in comfort, my darling, my little dearie, little angel and light of my eyes—only Varinka, how can it be so soon? ... Yes, business.... Mr. Bykov has business—of course, everyone has business, and he may have it too.... I saw him as he came out from you. He’s a good-looking man, good-looking; a very good-looking man, in fact. Only there is something queer about it, the point is not whether he is a good-looking man. Indeed, I am not myself at all. Why, how are we to go on writing to one another? I ... I shall be left alone. I am weighing everything, my angel, I am weighing everything as you write to me, I am weighing it all in my heart, the reasons. I had just finished copying the twentieth quire, and meanwhile these events have come upon us! Here you are going a journey, my darling, you will have to buy all sorts of things, shoes of all kinds, a dress, and I know just the shop in Gorohovoy Street; do you remember how I described it to you? But no! How can you, Varinka? what are you about? You can’t go away now , it’s quite impossible, utterly impossible. Why, you will have to buy a great many things and get a carriage. Besides, the weather is so awful now; look, the rain is coming down in bucketfuls, and such soaking rain, too, and what’s more .. what’s more, you will be cold, my angel; your little heart will be cold! Why, you are afraid of anyone strange, and yet you go. And to whom am I left, all alone here? Yes! Here, Fedora says that there is great happiness in store for you ... but you know she’s a headstrong woman , she wants to be the death of me. Are you going to the evening service to-night, Varinka? I would go to have a look at you. It’s true, perfectly true, my darling, that you are a well-educated, virtuous and feeling girl, only he had much better marry the shopkeeper’s daughter! Don’t you think so, my precious? He had better marry the shopkeeper’s daughter! I will come to see you, Varinka, as soon as it gets dark, I shall just run in for an hour. It will get dark early to-day, then I shall run in. I shall certainly come to you for an hour this evening, my darling. Now you are expecting Bykov, but when he goes, then ... Wait a bit, Varinka, I shall run across ..."

"Напишите мне теперь все откровенно, что с вами было и как вы решились на такой поступок. Успокойте меня, если можно. Не самолюбие заставляет меня писать теперь о моем спокойствии, но моя дружба и любовь к вам, которые ничем не изгладятся из моего сердца. Прощайте. Жду ответа вашего с нетерпением. Вы худо думали обо мне, Макар Алексеевич.","Write to me now everything frankly, what happened to you and how you decided on such an act. Reassure me if you can. It is not pride that compels me to write now about my calmness, but my friendship and love for you, which nothing will efface from my heart. Farewell. I look forward to your reply. You thought ill of me, Makar Alekseevich.","Write to me quite frankly. Tell me how you came to embark upon such a course of conduct. Comfort, oh, comfort me if you can. It is not self-love that prompts me to speak of my own comforting, but my friendship and love for you, which will never fade from my heart. Goodbye. I await your answer with impatience. You have thought but poorly of me, Makar Alexievitch.—Your friend and lover,","Please write me a frank account of what happened to you and how you could have come to behave like that.

I await your answer with impatience. You had a very poor idea of me, Makar Alexyevitch."
"Любезнейший Макар Алексеевич! Посылаю вам вашу книжку обратно. Это пренегодная книжонка! – и в руки брать нельзя. Откуда выкопали вы такую драгоценность? Кроме шуток, неужели вам нравятся такие книжки, Макар Алексеевич? Вот мне так обещались на днях достать чего-нибудь почитать. Я и с вами поделюсь, если хотите. А теперь до свидания. Право, некогда писать более.","Dearest Makar Alekseevich! I am sending you your book back. This is an awesome book! - and you can not take it in your hands. Where did you find such a treasure? Jokes aside, do you really like such books, Makar Alekseevich? So I was promised one of these days to get something to read. I will share with you if you want. And now goodbye. Indeed, there is no time to write more.","MY BELOVED MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH— I return you your book. In my opinion it is a worthless one, and I would rather not have it in my possession. Why do you save up your money to buy such trash? Except in jest, do such books really please you? However, you have now promised to send me something else to read. I will share the cost of it. Now, farewell until we meet again. I have nothing more to say.","My dear Makar Alekseyevich! I am returning your book to you. It is a thoroughly worthless little item!– and not fit for decent eyes, either. Where did you manage to dig up such a treasure? Joking apart, I wonder if you really like such books, Makar Alekseyevich? The other day I was promised something to read. If you like, I will share it with you. But now goodbye. Truly, I have no time to write more.","DEAR MAKAR ALEXYEVITCH. I am sending you back your book. A wretched, worthless little book not fit to touch! Where did you ferret out such a treasure?

I really have not time to write more."
"Вот что случилось! Расскажу вам без слога, а так, как мне на душу господь положит. Пошел я сегодня в должность. Пришел, сижу, пишу. А нужно вам знать, маточка, что я и вчера писал тоже. Ну, так вот, вчера подходит ко мне Тимофей Иванович и лично изволит наказывать, что – вот, дескать, бумага нужная, спешная. Перепишите, говорит, Макар Алексеевич, почище, поспешно и тщательно: сегодня к подписанию идет. Заметить вам нужно, ангельчик, что вчерашнего дня я был сам не свой, ни на что и глядеть не хотелось; грусть, тоска такая напала! На сердце холодно, на душе темно; в памяти все вы были, моя бедная ясочка. Ну, вот я принялся переписывать; переписал чисто, хорошо, только уж не знаю, как вам точнее сказать, сам ли нечистый меня попутал, или тайными судьбами какими определено было, или просто так должно было сделаться, – только пропустил я целую строчку; смысл-то и вышел, господь его знает какой, просто, никакого не вышло. С бумагой-то вчера опоздали и подали ее на подписание его превосходительству только сегодня. Я как ни в чем не бывало являюсь сегодня в обычный час и располагаюсь рядком с Емельяном Ивановичем. Нужно вам заметить, родная, что я с недавнего времени стал вдвое более прежнего совеститься и в стыд приходить. Я в последнее время и не глядел ни на кого. Чуть стул заскрипит у кого-нибудь, так уж я и ни жив ни мертв. Вот точно так сегодня, приник, присмирел, ежом сижу, так что Ефим Акимович (такой задирала, какого и на свете до него не было) сказал во всеуслышание: что, дескать, вы, Макар Алексеевич, сидите таким у-у-у? да тут такую гримасу скорчил, что все, кто около него и меня ни были, так и покатились со смеху, и уж, разумеется, на мой счет. И пошли, и пошли! Я и уши прижал и глаза зажмурил, сижу себе, не пошевелюсь. Таков уж обычай мой; они этак скорей отстают. Вдруг слышу шум, беготня, суетня; слышу – не обманываются ли уши мои? зовут меня, требуют меня, зовут Девушкина. Задрожало у меня сердце в груди, и уж сам не знаю, чего я испугался; только знаю то, что я так испугался, как никогда еще в жизни со мной не было. Я прирос к стулу, – и как ни в чем не бывало, точно и не я. Но вот опять начали, ближе и ближе. Вот уж над самым ухом моим: дескать, Девушкина! Девушкина! где Девушкин? Подымаю глаза: передо мною Евстафий Иванович; говорит: «Макар Алексеевич, к его превосходительству, скорее! Беды вы с бумагой наделали!» Только это одно и сказал, да довольно, не правда ли, маточка, довольно сказано было? Я помертвел, оледенел, чувств лишился, иду – ну, да уж просто ни жив ни мертв отправился. Ведут меня через одну комнату, через другую комнату, через третью комнату, в кабинет – предстал! Положительного отчета, об чем я тогда думал, я вам дать не могу. Вижу, стоят его превосходительство, вокруг него все они. Я, кажется, не поклонился; позабыл. Оторопел так, что и губы трясутся и ноги трясутся. Да и было отчего, маточка. Во-первых, совестно; я взглянул направо в зеркало, так просто было отчего с ума сойти от того, что я там увидел. А во-вторых, я всегда делал так, как будто бы меня и на свете не было. Так, что едва ли его превосходительство были известны о существовании моем. Может быть, слышали, так, мельком, что есть у них в ведомстве Девушкин, но в кратчайшие сего сношения никогда не входили.","That's what happened! I will tell you without a syllable, but as the Lord puts on my soul. I went to work today. I came, I sit, I write. And you need to know, mother, that I also wrote yesterday. Well, so, yesterday Timofei Ivanovich came up to me and personally deigned to punish me, that - here, they say, the paper is necessary, urgent. Rewrite, says Makar Alekseevich, cleaner, hastily and carefully: today it is going to be signed. You need to notice, angel, that yesterday I was not myself, I didn’t want to look at anything; sadness, such anguish! The heart is cold, the soul is dark; you were all in my memory, my poor yasochka. Well, so I began to rewrite; I wrote it cleanly, well, but I don’t know how to tell you more precisely whether the impure one himself beguiled me, or by what secret destinies it was determined, or it just had to happen like that - I just missed a whole line; the meaning came out, God knows what, it just didn’t work out. They were late with the paper yesterday and submitted it for signing to His Excellency only today. As if nothing had happened, I appear today at the usual hour and sit next to Emelyan Ivanovich. You should note, my dear, that recently I have become twice as conscience and ashamed as before. I haven't looked at anyone lately. If someone's chair creaks, I'm neither alive nor dead. That's exactly how today, hunched down, subdued, I'm sitting like a hedgehog, so that Efim Akimovich (such a bully, such as there was never in the world before him) said publicly: what, they say, you, Makar Alekseevich, are sitting like that woo? Yes, here he made such a grimace that everyone who was near him and me was rolling with laughter, and, of course, at my expense. And go and go! I pressed my ears and closed my eyes, I sit to myself, I won’t move. Such is my custom; they are falling behind quickly. Suddenly I hear a noise, running around, fuss; hear, are my ears deceived? They call me, they demand me, they call Devushkin. My heart trembled in my chest, and I don’t know what I was afraid of; I only know that I was so frightened as never before in my life had ever been with me. I rooted to the chair - and as if nothing had happened, just not me. But here we are again, closer and closer. Right above my ear: they say, Devushkina! Girls! where is Devushkin? I raise my eyes: in front of me is Evstafy Ivanovich; says: “Makar Alekseevich, to his excellency, quickly! You've done trouble with paper!"" That was the only thing he said, but that's enough, isn't it, mother, enough was said? I became dead, frozen, I lost my senses, I go - well, yes, I just left dead or alive. They take me through one room, through another room, through a third room, into an office - I have appeared! I cannot give you a positive report, as I thought then. I see His Excellency standing around him, they are all around him. I don't seem to have bowed; forgot. He was dumbfounded so that his lips were shaking and his legs were shaking. Yes, and there was a reason, mother. First, ashamed; I looked to the right in the mirror, it was so easy to go crazy from what I saw there. And secondly, I always acted as if I didn’t even exist in the world. So that hardly His Excellency was aware of my existence. Maybe they heard, just briefly, that they have Devushkin in their department, but they never entered into the shortest of this intercourse.","But no—I cannot say that I had NEVER foreseen it, for my mind DID get an inkling of what was coming, through my seeing something very similar to it in a dream. I will tell you the whole story—simply, and as God may put it into my heart. Today I went to the office as usual, and, upon arrival, sat down to write. You must know that I had been engaged on the same sort of work yesterday, and that, while executing it, I had been approached by Timothei Ivanovitch with an urgent request for a particular document. “Makar Alexievitch,” he had said, “pray copy this out for me. Copy it as quickly and as carefully as you can, for it will require to be signed today.” Also let me tell you, dearest, that yesterday I had not been feeling myself, nor able to look at anything. I had been troubled with grave depression—my breast had felt chilled, and my head clouded. All the while I had been thinking of you, my darling. Well, I set to work upon the copying, and executed it cleanly and well, except for the fact that, whether the devil confused my mind, or a mysterious fate so ordained, or the occurrence was simply bound to happen, I left out a whole line of the document, and thus made nonsense of it! The work had been given me too late for signature last night, so it went before his Excellency this morning. I reached the office at my usual hour, and sat down beside Emelia Ivanovitch. Here I may remark that for a long time past I have been feeling twice as shy and diffident as I used to do; I have been finding it impossible to look people in the face. Let only a chair creak, and I become more dead than alive. Today, therefore, I crept humbly to my seat and sat down in such a crouching posture that Efim Akimovitch (the most touchy man in the world) said to me sotto voce: “What on earth makes you sit like that, Makar Alexievitch?” Then he pulled such a grimace that everyone near us rocked with laughter at my expense. I stopped my ears, frowned, and sat without moving, for I found this the best method of putting a stop to such merriment. All at once I heard a bustle and a commotion and the sound of someone running towards us. Did my ears deceive me? It was I who was being summoned in peremptory tones! My heart started to tremble within me, though I could not say why. I only know that never in my life before had it trembled as it did then. Still I clung to my chair—and at that moment was hardly myself at all. The voices were coming nearer and nearer, until they were shouting in my ear: “Dievushkin! Dievushkin! Where is Dievushkin?” Then at length I raised my eyes, and saw before me Evstafi Ivanovitch. He said to me: “Makar Alexievitch, go at once to his Excellency. You have made a mistake in a document.” That was all, but it was enough, was it not? I felt dead and cold as ice— I felt absolutely deprived of the power of sensation; but, I rose from my seat and went whither I had been bidden. Through one room, through two rooms, through three rooms I passed, until I was conducted into his Excellency’s cabinet itself. Of my thoughts at that moment I can give no exact account. I merely saw his Excellency standing before me, with a knot of people around him. I have an idea that I did not salute him—that I forgot to do so. Indeed, so panic-stricken was I, that my teeth were chattering and my knees knocking together. In the first place, I was greatly ashamed of my appearance (a glance into a mirror on the right had frightened me with the reflection of myself that it presented), and, in the second place, I had always been accustomed to comport myself as though no such person as I existed. Probably his Excellency had never before known that I was even alive. Of course, he might have heard, in passing, that there was a man named Dievushkin in his department; but never for a moment had he had any intercourse with me.","This is what happened! I shall tell you without regard for style, just as the Good Lord puts the words into my head. I went to the department today. I arrived, sat down, and started to write. I should also tell you, little mother, that I had been writing the day before as well. Well, it was like this: Timofey Ivanovich came to me yesterday with an order for a document which was required in a hurry. ‘Please copy it cleanly, swiftly and carefully, Makar Alekseyevich,’ he said. ‘It is to be signed today.’ I should observe, little angel, that I was not quite myself yesterday, and had no interest in anything; such were the sadness and depression that had overtaken me. My heart was cold and my soul was dark; my memory held nothing but you, my poor little treasure. Well, so I got down to the task of copying; I did the work cleanly and well, except that – I don’t know how to explain it to you, whether it was the work of the Unclean One, whether it had been preordained by some secret Fate, or whether it simply had to happen that way – I left out a whole line; Lord knows what sense it must have made, it simply didn’t make any. There was a delay over the delivery of the document, and it wasn’t handed to His Excellency for signature until today. I reported for work this morning at the usual time and stationed myself beside Yemelyan Ivanovich. I should observe to you, my dear, that I have recently begun to feel twice as ashamed and apologetic as I used to. I’ve recently begun to find it impossible to look at anyone. If anyone is chair so much as gives a creak, I feel more dead than alive. That was how it was today: I sat huddled up, not making a sound, like a hedgehog, with the result that Yefim Akimovich (there never was such a bully) said so that everyone could hear: ‘What are you sitting there looking so scared for, Makar Alekseyevich?’ And he made such a face that absolutely everyone near us split their sides with laughter, at my expense, of course. They laughed, and they laughed! I stuck my fingers in my ears and shut my eyes, just sat there, not moving. That is what I usually do; that way they usually desist sooner. Suddenly I heard noise, the sound of running footsteps, fuss and bustle ; I listened – surely my ears must be deceiving me? My name was being called, someone was asking for me, for Devushkin. My heart began to quiver within me, and I still don’t really know why I was so scared; all I know is that I was more scared than I have ever been in my life before. I became rooted to mychair – asthough nothing were wrong, as though I were not even there. But again the voice started up, coming nearer and nearer. At last it was right next to my ear: ‘ Devushkin! Devushkin! Where is Devushkin?’ I raised my eyes: before me stood Yevstafy Ivanovich; he said: ‘Makar Alekseyevich, you’ve to go to His Excellency, at the double! You’ve made a mistake in a document!’ That was all he said, but it was enough, little mother, don’t you think! I went numb, froze, lost all feeling; and began to walk, more dead than alive. I was escorted through one room, through a second, then a third, into a study – I stood before His Excellency! It is impossible for me to give you a positive account of the thoughts that passed through my mind at that moment. I saw His Excellency standing there, and they were all standing around him. I don’t think I bowed; I forgot. Struck dumb, I merely stood there, my lips trembling and my legs shaking. And I had reason to be struck dumb, little mother. For one thing, I was ashamed of myself; I took a glance in a mirror to the right of me, and what I saw in it nearly sent me out of my mind. And for another, I have always tried to do my job as though I myself were not actually there. So that it was hardly likely that His Excellency could know of my existence. Perhaps he might have heard in passing, as it were, that there was a member of staff named Devushkin in the department, but he would never have had any close dealings with him.","This is what happened! I will write to you regardless of style, just as God puts it into my heart. I went to the office to-day. I went in , I sat down, I began writing. And you must know, Varinka, that I was writing yesterday too. Well, this is how it was:Timofey Ivanovitch came up to me and was pleased to explain to me in person, “The document is wanted in a hurry,” said he. “Copy it very clearly as quickly as possible and carefully, Makar Alexyevitch,” he said; “it goes to be signed today.” I must observe, my angel, that I was not myself yesterday, I could not bear the sight of anything; such a mood of sadness and depression had come over me! It was cold in my heart and dark in my soul, you were in my mind all the while, my little dearie. But I set to work to copy it; I copied it clearly, legibly, only—I really don’t know how to explain it—whether the devil himself muddled me, or whether it was ordained by some secret decree of destiny, or simply it had to be—but I left out a whole line, goodness knows what sense it made, it simply made none at all. They were late with the document yesterday and only took it to his Excellency to be signed to-day. I turned up this morning at the usual hour as though nothing had happened and settled myself beside Emelyan Ivanovitch. I must observe, my own, that of late I have been more abashed and ill at ease than ever. Of late I have given up looking at anyone. If I hear so much as a chair creak I feel more dead than alive. That is just how it was to-day, I sat down like a hedgehog crouched up and shrinking into myself, so that Efim Akimovitch (there never was such a fellow for teasing) said in the hearing of all: “Why are you sitting like a picture of misery, Makar Alexyevitch?” And he made such a grimace that everyone sitting near him and me went off into roars of laughter, and at my expense of course. And they went on and on. I put my hands over my ears, and screwed up my eyes, I sat without stirring. That’s what I always do; they leave off the sooner. Suddenly I heard a noise, a fuss and a bustle; I heard—did not my ears deceive me?—they were mentioning me, asking for me, calling Dyevushkin. My heart began shuddering within me, and I don’t know myself why I was so frightened ; I only know I was panic-stricken as I had never been before in my life. I sat rooted to my chair—as though there were nothing the matter, as though it were not I. But they began getting nearer and nearer. And at last, close to my ear, they were calling, “Dyevushkin, Dyevushkin! Where is Dyevushkin?” I raised my eyes: Yevstafy Ivanovitch stood before me; he said: “Makar Alexyevitch, make haste to his Excellency! You’ve made a mistake in that document!” That was all he said, but it was enough; enough had been said, hadn’t it, Varinka? Half dead, frozen with terror, not knowing what I was doing, I went—why, I was more dead than alive. I was led through one room, through a second, through a third, to his Excellency’s study. I was in his presence! I can give you no exact account of what my thoughts were then. I saw his Excellency standing up, they were all standing round him. I believe I did not bow, I forgot. I was so flustered that my lips were trembling, my legs were trembling. And I had reason to be, my dear girl! To begin with, I was ashamed; I glanced into the looking-glass on the right hand and what I saw there was enough to send one out of one’s mind. And in the second place, I had always tried to behave as if there were no such person in the world. So that his Excellency could hardly have been aware of my existence. Perhaps he may have heard casually that there was a clerk called Dyevushkin in the office, but he had never gone into the matter more closely."

"А я-то думал, маточка, что вы мне все вчерашнее настоящими стихами опишете, а у вас и всего-то вышел один простой листик. Я к тому говорю, что вы хотя и мало мне в листке вашем написали, но зато необыкновенно хорошо и сладко описали. И природа, и разные картины сельские, и все остальное про чувства – одним словом, все это вы очень хорошо описали. А вот у меня так нет таланту. Хоть десять страниц намарай, никак ничего не выходит, ничего не опишешь. Я уж пробовал. Пишете вы мне, родная моя, что я человек добрый, незлобивый, ко вреду ближнего неспособный и благость господню, в природе являемую, разумеющий, и разные наконец похвалы воздаете мне. Все это правда, маточка, все это совершенная правда; я и действительно таков, как вы говорите, и сам это знаю; но как прочтешь такое, как вы пишете, так поневоле умилится сердце, а потом разные тягостные рассуждения придут. А вот прислушайте меня, маточка, я кое-что расскажу вам, родная моя.","And I thought, mother, that you would describe everything yesterday to me with real verses, but you only got one simple leaf. I am saying that although you wrote little to me in your paper, you described it unusually well and sweetly. And nature, and various rural paintings, and everything else about feelings - in a word, you described all this very well. But I don't have the talent. Even if you smear ten pages, nothing comes out, you can’t describe anything. I already tried. You write to me, my dear, that I am a kind, gentle person, incapable of harming my neighbor and the goodness of the Lord, manifested in nature, understanding, and finally give me various praises. All this is true, mother, all this is absolutely true; I really am what you say, and I know it myself; but as soon as you read such as you write, your heart will involuntarily be touched, and then various painful arguments will come. But listen to me, mother, I'll tell you something, my dear.","—I had supposed that you meant to describe our doings of the other day in verse; yet from you there has arrived only a single sheet of writing. Nevertheless, I must say that, little though you have put into your letter, that little is not expressed with rare beauty and grace. Nature, your descriptions of rural scenes, your analysis of your own feelings—the whole is beautifully written. Alas, I have no such talent! Though I may fill a score of pages, nothing comes of it—I might as well never have put pen to paper. Yes, this I know from experience. You say, my darling, that I am kind and good, that I could not harm my fellow-men, that I have power to comprehend the goodness of God (as expressed in nature’s handiwork), and so on. It may all be so, my dearest one—it may all be exactly as you say. Indeed, I think that you are right. But if so, the reason is that when one reads such a letter as you have just sent me, one’s heart involuntarily softens, and affords entrance to thoughts of a graver and weightier order. Listen, my darling; I have something to tell you, my beloved one.","Why, little mother, there was I thinking you were going to describe everything we saw yesterday in proper verses, yet all you have produced is one single small sheet of prose. I say this because although you do not say much in your little letter, it is none the less uncommonly well and pleasingly described. The natural surroundings, the various rural scenes, and all the rest about feelings – you really have described all that very well. You see, I have no talent for that kind of thing. Even though I fill ten pages with my scribbling, nothing comes of it. I am unable to describe anything. I have already tried. My dear, you tell me that I am a good man, lacking in malice, incapable of harming his fellow creatures and possessing an understanding of the Lord is grace as it is manifested in nature, and you end by showering me with various forms of praise. All that is true, little mother, all that is completely true; I really am as you say , I know it myself; but when a man reads the kind of thing you write, his heart is moved, and then various painful thoughts come into his mind. But now listen to me, little mother, while I tell you something, my dear.","Well, I had expected, my dear soul, that you would write me a description of our yesterday’s expedition in a regular poem, and you have turned out nothing but one simple sheet. I say this because, though you wrote me so little in your sheet, yet you did describe it extraordinarily well and sweetly. The charms of nature, and the various rural scenes and all the rest about your feeling—in short, you described it all very well. Now I have no talent for it. If I smudge a dozen papers there’s nothing to show for it; I can’t describe anything. I have tried. You write to me, my own, that I am a kind-hearted, good-natured man, incapable of injuring my neighbour, and able to understand the blessings of the Lord made manifest in nature, and you bestow various praises on me, in fact. All that is true, my darling , all that is perfectly true; I really am all that you say and I know it myself; but when one reads what you write one’s heart is touched in spite of oneself and then all sorts of painful reflections come to one. Well, listen to me, Varinka dear, I will tell you something, my own."
"Р. S. Мне так совестно, что я все вас мучаю моими комиссиями. Вот и третьего дня вы целое утро бегали. Но что делать! У нас в доме нет никакого порядка, а я сама нездорова. Так не досадуйте на меня, Макар Алексеевич. Такая тоска! Ах, что это будет, друг мой, милый мой, добрый мой Макар Алексеевич! Я и заглянуть боюсь в мое будущее. Я все что-то предчувствую и точно в чаду в каком-то живу.","R. S. I am so ashamed that I am torturing you all with my commissions. So the third day you ran all morning. But what to do! There is no order in our house, and I myself am unwell. So don't be annoyed with me, Makar Alekseevich. Such longing! Oh, what will it be, my friend, my dear, my good Makar Alekseevich! I'm afraid to look into my future. I always have a premonition of something and I live in some kind of a child.","B. D. P.S.—I am so ashamed to trouble you with my commissions! This is the third morning that you will have spent in running about for my sake. But what else am I to do? The whole place is in disorder, and I myself am ill. Do not be vexed with me, Makar Alexievitch. I am feeling so depressed! What is going to become of me, dear friend, dear, kind, old Makar Alexievitch? I dread to look forward into the future. Somehow I feel apprehensive; I am living, as it were, in a mist.","V. D. PS I feel so guilty about troubling you with my errands. It was only the other day that you spent the whole morning running around for my sake. But what can I do? The house is in chaos, and I am unwell. So please don’t be annoyed with me, Makar Alekseyevich. I’m so depressed! Oh, what will become of me, my friend, my dear, good Makar Alekseyevich? I’m afraid to look into the future. I have a certain premonition of what will happen, and am living in a kind of daze.","Your P.S.—I am so ashamed of worrying you with all my errands. The day before yesterday you were running about all the morning. But what can I do! There’s no sort of order in the house here, and I am not well. So don’t be vexed with me, Makar Alexyevitch. I’m so miserable. Oh, how will it end, my friend, my dear, my kind Makar Alexyevitch? I’m afraid to look into my future. I have a presentiment of something and am living in a sort of delirium."
"Ну, хорошо, ангельчик мой, хорошо! Вы решили, что еще не беда оттого, что я денег не достал. Ну, хорошо, я спокоен, я счастлив на ваш счет! Даже рад, что вы меня, старика, не покидаете и на этой квартире останетесь. Да уж если все говорить, так и сердце-то мое все радостию переполнилось, когда я увидел, что вы обо мне в своем письмеце так хорошо написали и чувствам моим должную похвалу воздали. Я это не от гордости говорю, но оттого, что вижу, как вы меня любите, когда об сердце моем так беспокоитесь. Ну, хорошо; что уж теперь об сердце-то моем говорить! Сердце само по себе; а вот вы наказываете, маточка, чтобы я малодушным не был. Да, ангельчик мой, пожалуй, и сам скажу, что не нужно его, малодушия-то; да при всем этом, решите сами, маточка моя, в каких сапогах я завтра на службу пойду! Вот оно что, маточка; а ведь подобная мысль погубить человека может, совершенно погубить. А главное, родная моя, что я не для себя и тужу, не для себя и страдаю; по мне все равно, хоть бы и в трескучий мороз без шинели и без сапогов ходить, я перетерплю и все вынесу, мне ничего; человек-то я простой, маленький, – но что люди скажут? Враги-то мои, злые-то языки эти все, что заговорят, когда без шинели пойдешь? Ведь для людей и в шинели ходишь, да и сапоги, пожалуй, для них же носишь. Сапоги в таком случае, маточка, душечка вы моя, нужны мне для поддержки чести и доброго имени; в дырявых же сапогах и то и другое пропало, – поверьте, маточка, опытности моей многолетней поверьте; меня, старика, знающего свет и людей, послушайте, а не пачкунов каких-нибудь и марателей.","Well, well, my angel, well! You decided that it didn't matter if I didn't get the money. Well, well, I'm calm, I'm happy about you! I’m even glad that you don’t leave me, the old man, and stay in this apartment. Yes, if I say everything, my heart was overflowing with joy when I saw that you wrote so well about me in your letter and paid due praise to my feelings. I am not saying this out of pride, but because I see how much you love me when you are so worried about my heart. OK then; what can I say about my heart now! The heart itself; but you are punishing me, mother, so that I would not be cowardly. Yes, my little angel, perhaps I myself will say that there is no need for him, cowardice; Yes, with all this, decide for yourself, my mother, in what boots I will go to the service tomorrow! That's it, mother; but such a thought can destroy a person, completely destroy him. And the main thing, my dear, is that I do not grieve for myself, and suffer not for myself; it doesn’t matter to me, even if in the bitter cold without an overcoat and without boots, I will endure and endure everything, nothing to me; I am a simple, small person - but what will people say? My enemies, these evil tongues are all that they will speak when you go without an overcoat? After all, you walk in an overcoat for people, and, perhaps, you wear boots for them. Boots in this case, my mother, my darling, I need to support my honor and good name; in holey boots, both of them were gone - believe me, mother, believe in my many years of experience; listen to me, an old man who knows the world and people, and not some dirty tricks and scoundrels.",", this is well, my angel! So you are of opinion that the fact that I have failed to obtain any money does not matter? Then I too am reassured, I too am happy on your account. Also, I am delighted to think that you are not going to desert your old friend, but intend to remain in your present lodgings. Indeed, my heart was overcharged with joy when I read in your letter those kindly words about myself, as well as a not wholly unmerited recognition of my sentiments. I say this not out of pride, but because now I know how much you love me to be thus solicitous for my feelings. How good to think that I may speak to you of them! You bid me, darling, not be faint-hearted. Indeed, there is no need for me to be so. Think, for instance, of the pair of shoes which I shall be wearing to the office tomorrow! The fact is that over-brooding proves the undoing of a man—his complete undoing. What has saved me is the fact that it is not for myself that I am grieving, that I am suffering, but for YOU. Nor would it matter to me in the least that I should have to walk through the bitter cold without an overcoat or boots —I could bear it, I could well endure it, for I am a simple man in my requirements; but the point is—what would people say, what would every envious and hostile tongue exclaim, when I was seen without an overcoat? It is for OTHER folk that one wears an overcoat and boots. In any case, therefore, I should have needed boots to maintain my name and reputation; to both of which my ragged footgear would otherwise have spelled ruin. Yes, it is so, my beloved, and you may believe an old man who has had many years of experience, and knows both the world and mankind, rather than a set of scribblers and daubers.","Well, that is fine, my little angel, that’s fine! You have decided that it is not a complete disaster, my failure to get the money. Well, that’s fine, my mind is at rest, I am happy on your account. I am even glad that you are not going to abandon me, old man that I am, and that you will remain in your present apartment. In fact, to tell you the truth, my heart overflowed with joy when I read all the nice things you said about me in your letter and saw how you rendered my feelings the praise that was due. I say this not out of pride, but because I can see how you must love me, if you are so worried about my feelings. Well, that’s fine; what is there to be said about feelings, in any case? Feelings do as they will; but then, little mother, you also tell me not to be faint-hearted. Yes, my little angel, indeed, I am the first to admit that it is no good being faint-hearted; yet for all that, see for yourself, little mother, what manner of boots I must wear to the office tomorrow! There’s the rub, little mother; but I mean, a thought like that can crush a man, crush him totally. But the main thing, my darling, is that it is not myself I am grieving for, not myself for whose sake I am suffering; it is all the same to me, I’ll go around without an overcoat in the biting frost and manage without boots, I’ll suffer it and put up with it, I don’t mind; I’m an ordinary man, a little man – but what will people say? My enemies, all these evil tongues, what will they say if I go around with no overcoat on? After all, one wears an overcoat for the sake of other people, and the same is true of boots. I need boots, little mother, my darling, in order to maintain my honour and my good name; if my boots have holes in them, I can say goodbye to both the one and the other – believe me, little mother, and trust in my many years of experience; listen to me, an old man who knows the world and its inhabitants, listen to me, and not to scribblers and scrawlers.","Very well, my angel, very well! You have made up your mind that it is no harm so far that I have not got the money. Well, very good, I feel reassured, I am happy as regards you. I am delighted, in fact, that you are not going to leave me in my old age but are going to stay in your lodging. In fact, to tell you everything, my heart was brimming over with joy when I saw that you wrote so nicely about me in your letter and gave due credit to my feelings. I don’t say this from pride, but because I see how you love me when you are so anxious about my heart. Well, what’s the use of talking about my heart! The heart goes its own way, but you hint, my precious, that I mustn’t be downhearted. Yes, my angel, maybe, and I say myself it is of no use being downhearted ! but for all that, you tell me, my dear girl, what boots I am to go to the office in to-morrow! That’s the trouble, Varinka; and you know such a thought destroys a man, destroys him utterly. And the worst of it is, my own, that it is not for myself I am troubled, it is not for myself I am distressed; as far as I am concerned I don’t mind going about without an overcoat and without boots in the hardest frost; I don’t care: I can stand anything, and put up with anything. I am a humble man of no importance,—but what will people say? My enemies with their spiteful tongues, what will they say, when one goes about without an overcoat?You know it is for the sake of other people one wears an overcoat, yes, and boots, too , you put on, perhaps, on their account. Boots, in such cases, Varinka darling, are necessary to keep up one’s dignity and good name: in boots with holes in them, both dignity and good name are lost; trust the experience of my years, my dear child, listen to an old man like me who knows the world and what people are, and not to any scurrilous scribblers and satirists."

"С этого дня я начала мучить воображение мое, создавая тысячи планов, каким бы образом вдруг заставить Покровского изменить свое мнение обо мне. Но я была подчас робка и застенчива: в настоящем положении моем я ни на что не могла решиться и ограничивалась одними мечтаниями (и бог знает какими мечтаниями!). Я перестала только проказничать вместе с Сашей; он перестал на нас сердиться; но для самолюбия моего этого было мало.","From that day on, I began to torment my imagination, creating thousands of plans for how to suddenly force Pokrovsky to change his mind about me.

I stopped only playing pranks with Sasha; he stopped being angry with us; but that was not enough for my pride.","Therefore, from that day onwards I began to torture my imagination with devising a thousand schemes which should compel Pokrovski to alter his opinion of me.

"Пришел я в грустном расположении духа домой, присел к столу, нагрел себе чайник, да и приготовился стаканчик-другой чайку хлебнуть. Вдруг, смотрю, входит ко мне Горшков, наш бедный постоялец. Я еще утром заметил, что он все что-то около жильцов шныряет и ко мне хотел подойти. А мимоходом скажу, маточка, что их житье-бытье не в пример моего хуже. Куда! жена, дети! Так что если бы я был Горшков, так уж я не знаю, что бы я на его месте сделал! Ну, так вот, вошел мой Горшков, кланяется, слезинка у него, как и всегда, на ресницах гноится, шаркает ногами, а сам слова не может сказать. Я его посадил на стул, правда, на изломанный, да другого не было. Чайку предложил. Он извинялся, долго извинялся, наконец, однако же, взял стакан. Хотел было без сахару пить, начал опять извиняться, когда я стал уверять его, что нужно взять сахару; долго спорил, отказываясь, наконец положил в свой стакан самый маленький кусочек и стал уверять, что чай необыкновенно сладок. Эк, до уничижения какого доводит людей нищета! «Ну, как же, что, батюшка?» – сказал я ему. «Да вот так и так, дескать, благодетель вы мой, Макар Алексеевич, явите милость господню, окажите помощь семейству несчастному; дети и жена, есть нечего; отцу-то, мне-то, говорит, каково!» Я было хотел говорить, да он меня прервал: «Я, дескать, всех боюсь здесь, Макар Алексеевич, то есть не то что боюсь, а так, знаете, совестно; люди-то они всё гордые и кичливые. Я бы, говорит, вас, батюшка и благодетель мой, и утруждать бы не стал: знаю, что у вас самих неприятности были, знаю, что вы многого и не можете дать, но хоть что-нибудь взаймы одолжите; и потому, говорит, просить вас осмелился, что знаю ваше доброе сердце, знаю, что вы сами нуждались, что сами и теперь бедствия испытываете, – и что сердце-то ваше потому и чувствует сострадание». Заключил же он тем, что, дескать, простите мою дерзость и мое неприличие, Макар Алексеевич. Я отвечаю ему, что рад бы душой, да что нет у меня ничего, ровно нет ничего. «Батюшка, Макар Алексеевич, – говорит он мне, – я многого и не прошу, а вот так и так (тут он весь покраснел), жена, говорит, дети, – голодно – хоть гривенничек какой-нибудь». Ну, тут уж мне самому сердце защемило. Куда, думаю, меня перещеголяли! А всего-то у меня и оставалось двадцать копеек, да я на них рассчитывал: хотел завтра на свои крайние нужды истратить. «Нет, голубчик мой, не могу; вот так и так», – говорю. «Батюшка, Макар Алексеевич, хоть что хотите, говорит, хоть десять копеечек». Ну, я ему и вынул из ящика и отдал свои двадцать копеек, маточка, все доброе дело! Эк, нищета-то! Разговорился я с ним: да как же вы, батюшка, спрашиваю, так зануждались, да еще при таких нуждах комнату в пять рублей серебром нанимаете? Объяснил он мне, что полгода назад нанял и деньги внес вперед за три месяца; да потом обстоятельства такие сошлись, что ни туда ни сюда ему, бедному. Ждал он, что дело его к этому времени кончится. А дело у него неприятное. Он, видите ли, Варенька, за что-то перед судом в ответе находится. Тягается он с купцом каким-то, который сплутовал подрядом с казною; обман открыли, купца под суд, а он в дело-то свое разбойничье и Горшкова запутал, который тут как-то также случился. А по правде-то Горшков виновен только в нерадении, в неосмотрительности и в непростительном упущении из вида казенного интереса. Уж несколько лет дело идет: все препятствия разные встречаются против Горшкова. «В бесчестии же, на меня взводимом, – говорит мне Горшков, – неповинен, нисколько неповинен, в плутовстве и грабеже неповинен». Дело это его замарало немного; его исключили из службы, и хотя не нашли, что он капитально виновен, но, до совершенного своего оправдания, он до сих пор не может выправить с купца какой-то знатной суммы денег, ему следуемой и перед судом у него оспариваемой. Я ему верю, да суд-то ему на слово не верит; дело-то оно такое, что все в крючках да в узлах таких, что во сто лет не распутаешь. Чуть немного распутают, а купец еще крючок да еще крючок. Я принимаю сердечное участие в Горшкове, родная моя, соболезную ему. Человек без должности; за ненадежность никуда не принимается; что было запасу, проели; дело запутано, а между тем ни с того ни с сего, совершенно некстати, ребенок родился, – ну вот издержки; сын заболел – издержки, умер – издержки; жена больна; он нездоров застарелой болезнью какой-то: одним словом, пострадал, вполне пострадал. Впрочем, говорит, что ждет на днях благоприятного решения своего дела и что уж в этом теперь и сомнения нет никакого. Жаль, жаль, очень жаль его, маточка! Я его обласкал. Человек-то он затерянный, запутанный; покровительства ищет, так вот я его и обласкал. Ну, прощайте же, маточка, Христос с вами, будьте здоровы. Голубчик вы мой! Как вспомню об вас, так точно лекарство приложу к больной душе моей, и хоть страдаю за вас, но и страдать за вас мне легко.","I came home in a sad mood, sat down at the table, warmed up a kettle for myself, and got ready to sip a glass or two of tea. Suddenly, I see Gorshkov, our poor lodger, enters me. I noticed in the morning that he was always snooping around the residents and wanted to come up to me. And in passing I will say, mother, that their life is worse than mine. Where! wife children! So if I were Gorshkov, I really don’t know what I would do in his place! Well, so, my Gorshkov came in, bowing, a tear on his eyelashes, as always, festering, shuffling his feet, but he himself could not say a word. I put him on a chair, however, on a broken one, but there was no other. Offered a seagull. He apologized, he apologized for a long time, but at last he took the glass. He wanted to drink without sugar, he began to apologize again when I began to assure him that he should take sugar; He argued for a long time, refusing, finally put the smallest piece into his glass and began to assure that the tea was unusually sweet. Ek, to what humiliation poverty brings people! “Well, how is it, father?” I told him. “Yes, like this and this, they say, you are my benefactor, Makar Alekseevich, show the mercy of the Lord, help the unfortunate family; children and wife, nothing to eat; father something, me something, says what it's like! I was about to speak, but he interrupted me: “I, they say, am afraid of everyone here, Makar Alekseevich, that is, not that I am afraid, but, you know, ashamed; they are all proud and arrogant people. I would, he says, you, my father and benefactor, and would not bother: I know that you yourself had troubles, I know that you cannot give much, but at least lend something; and therefore, he says, I dared to ask you because I know your good heart, I know that you yourself were in need, that you yourself are now experiencing disasters - and that is why your heart feels compassion. He concluded by saying that, they say, forgive my insolence and my indecency, Makar Alekseevich. I answer him that I would be glad with my soul, but that I have nothing, absolutely nothing. “Father, Makar Alekseevich,” he says to me, “I don’t ask for much, but like this and this (here he blushed all over), his wife, he says, children, I’m hungry - at least some dime.” Well, this is where my heart sank. Where, I think, I was outdone! And all I had was twenty kopecks, but I counted on them: I wanted to spend tomorrow on my extreme needs. “No, my dear, I cannot; like this,"" I say. “Father, Makar Alekseevich, whatever you want, he says, at least ten kopecks.” Well, I took him out of the box and gave my twenty kopecks, mother, all a good deed! Eh, poverty! I talked to him: but how are you, father, I ask, were you so tired, and even with such needs you rent a room for five rubles in silver? He explained to me that he had hired him six months ago and paid in advance three months in advance; and then such circumstances came together that neither here nor there for him, the poor. He expected that his work would be over by this time. And he's got a bad job. He, you see, Varenka, is responsible for something before the court. He competes with some merchant who cheated in a contract with the treasury; the deceit was discovered, the merchant was put on trial, and he confused Gorshkov in his robbery business, which somehow also happened here. But in truth, Gorshkov is guilty only of negligence, indiscretion and an unforgivable omission from the view of government interest. Things have been going on for several years: all kinds of obstacles are encountered against Gorshkov. “In the dishonor that is being brought on me,” Gorshkov tells me, “I am innocent, not at all guilty, I am innocent of cheating and robbery.” This matter sullied him a little; he was expelled from the service, and although they did not find that he was fundamentally guilty, but, until his perfect acquittal, he still cannot straighten out from the merchant some noble sum of money, followed by him and disputed before the court. I believe him, but the court does not take his word for it; the point is that everything is in hooks and in such knots that you cannot unravel in a hundred years. They unravel a little, and the merchant still has a hook, and even a hook. I take heartfelt participation in Gorshkov, my dear, I condole with him. A person without a position; for unreliability is not accepted anywhere; what was left was eaten; the matter is confused, and meanwhile, for no apparent reason, completely inopportunely, the child was born - well, here are the costs; the son fell ill - costs, died - costs; the wife is sick; he is unwell with some kind of chronic illness: in a word, he suffered, he completely suffered. However, he says that he is expecting a favorable decision in his case in the next few days, and that now there is no doubt about it. Sorry, sorry, very sorry for him, mother! I caressed him. He is a lost, confused man; looking for patronage, and so I caressed him. Well, goodbye, mother, Christ be with you, be healthy. You are my dove! As soon as I remember you, I will apply medicine to my sick soul, and although I suffer for you, it is easy for me to suffer for you.","Sitting down to the table, I had warmed myself some tea, and was about to drink a second glass of it, when there entered Gorshkov, the poor lodger. Already, this morning, I had noticed that he was hovering around the other lodgers, and also seeming to want to speak to myself. In passing I may say that his circumstances are infinitely worse than my own; for, only think of it, he has a wife and children! Indeed, if I were he, I do not know what I should do. Well, he entered my room, and bowed to me with the pus standing, as usual, in drops on his eyelashes, his feet shuffling about, and his tongue unable, at first, to articulate a word. I motioned him to a chair (it was a dilapidated enough one, but I had no other), and asked him to have a glass of tea. To this he demurred—for quite a long time he demurred, but at length he accepted the offer. Next, he was for drinking the tea without sugar, and renewed his excuses, but upon the sugar I insisted. After long resistance and many refusals, he DID consent to take some, but only the smallest possible lump; after which, he assured me that his tea was perfectly sweet. To what depths of humility can poverty reduce a man! “ Well, what is it, my good sir?” I inquired of him; whereupon he replied: “It is this, Makar Alexievitch. You have once before been my benefactor. Pray again show me the charity of God, and assist my unfortunate family. My wife and children have nothing to eat. To think that a father should have to say this!” I was about to speak again when he interrupted me. “You see,” he continued, “I am afraid of the other lodgers here. That is to say, I am not so much afraid of, as ashamed to address them, for they are a proud, conceited lot of men. Nor would I have troubled even you, my friend and former benefactor, were it not that I know that you yourself have experienced misfortune and are in debt; wherefore, I have ventured to come and make this request of you, in that I know you not only to be kind-hearted, but also to be in need, and for that reason the more likely to sympathise with me in my distress.” To this he added an apology for his awkwardness and presumption. I replied that, glad though I should have been to serve him, I had nothing, absolutely nothing, at my disposal. “Ah, Makar Alexievitch,” he went on, “surely it is not much that I am asking of you? My-my wife and children are starving. C-could you not afford me just a grivennik?” At that my heart contracted, “How these people put me to shame!” thought I. But I had only twenty kopecks left, and upon them I had been counting for meeting my most pressing requirements. “No, good sir, I cannot,” said I. “Well, what you will,” he persisted. “Perhaps ten kopecks?” Well I got out my cash-box, and gave him the twenty. It was a good deed. To think that such poverty should exist! Then I had some further talk with him. “How is it,” I asked him, “that, though you are in such straits, you have hired a room at five roubles?” He replied that though, when he engaged the room six months ago, he paid three months’ rent in advance, his affairs had subsequently turned out badly, and never righted themselves since. You see, Barbara, he was sued at law by a merchant who had defrauded the Treasury in the matter of a contract. When the fraud was discovered the merchant was prosecuted, but the transactions in which he had engaged involved Gorshkov, although the latter had been guilty only of negligence, want of prudence, and culpable indifference to the Treasury’s interests. True, the affair had taken place some years ago, but various obstacles had since combined to thwart Gorshkov. “Of the disgrace put upon me,” said he to me, “I am innocent. True, I to a certain extent disobeyed orders, but never did I commit theft or embezzlement.” Nevertheless the affair lost him his character. He was dismissed the service, and though not adjudged capitally guilty, has been unable since to recover from the merchant a large sum of money which is his by right, as spared to him (Gorshkov) by the legal tribunal. True, the tribunal in question did not altogether believe in Gorshkov, but I do so. The matter is of a nature so complex and crooked that probably a hundred years would be insufficient to unravel it; and, though it has now to a certain extent been cleared up, the merchant still holds the key to the situation. Personally I side with Gorshkov, and am very sorry for him. Though lacking a post of any kind, he still refuses to despair, though his resources are completely exhausted. Yes, it is a tangled affair, and meanwhile he must live, for, unfortunately, another child which has been born to him has entailed upon the family fresh expenses. Also, another of his children recently fell ill and died—which meant yet further expense. Lastly, not only is his wife in bad health, but he himself is suffering from a complaint of long standing. In short, he has had a very great deal to undergo. Yet he declares that daily he expects a favourable issue to his affair—that he has no doubt of it whatever. I am terribly sorry for him, and said what I could to give him comfort, for he is a man who has been much bullied and misled. He had come to me for protection from his troubles, so I did my best to soothe him. Now, goodbye, my darling. May Christ watch over you and preserve your health. Dearest one, even to think of you is like medicine to my ailing soul. Though I suffer for you, I at least suffer gladly.—Your true friend,","I arrived home in a melancholy state of mind, sat down at the table, warmed my teapot and made myself a couple of glasses of tea. Suddenly I saw Gorshkov, our poor lodger, coming towards me. Earlier, on the morning of that day, I had noticed him poking about near the other residents and looking as though he wanted to come up to me. I should tell you in passing, little mother, that he is far worse off than I am. Far, far worse off! He has a wife and children! If I were in his shoes, I don’t know what I should do. Well, anyway, our Gorshkov came in and bowed, a tear festering in his eyelashes as always, shuffling his feet and unable to get a word out. I made him sit down on my other chair – it’s broken, I know, but it must suffice. I offered him some tea. He kept trying to give me reasons why he shouldn’t have any, went on for ages about that, but he finally accepted a glass. He would have drunk it without sugar, and began once more to resist when I tried to persuade him to take some, spent a long time arguing and refusing, and finally put the very smallest lump in his glass, assuring me that the tea I had given him was unusually sweet. Oh, what humiliations people are driven to by poverty!‘Well, what is it, old fellow?’ I said to him. ‘Oh, it’s like this, Makar Alekseyevich, my benefactor,’ he said. IShow the Lord’s mercy and help my unhappy family; I’ve a wife and children, and they have nothing to eat; think how hard that is for me to bear as a father!’ I started to reply, but he broke me off: ‘I’m scared of all the people here, Makar Alekseyevich – that is to say , I’m not so much scared of them, as, well, you know, ashamed in front of them; they’re all such a proud and conceited lot. Normally I wouldn’t have bothered you, my friend and benefactor: I know that you yourself have been in difficulties, I know that you’re not in a position to give me much, but at least lend me something. Also,’ he said, ‘I’ve made so bold as to ask you because I know you have a kind heart , I know that you yourself have been in need, that you are even now experiencing misfortunes – and that your heart will therefore feel compassion.’ He concluded by asking me to forgive him for his ‘insolence and impropriety’. I replied that I would like nothing better than to lend him some money, but that I had none, absolutely nothing. ‘ Makar Alekseyevich, old chap ,’ he said to me, ‘it’s not much I’m asking for, it’s just that what with one thing and another (here he blushed all over ) my wife and children are hungry – if you could even just spare me a copper or two.’ Well, when I heard that I felt a tug at my heart. ‘ Why,’ I thought,’they’re even worse off than I am!’ But all I had left was twenty copecks, and I needed it all: I was going to spend it the following day on my most basic requirements. ‘ No, my dear fellow, I can’t; what with one thing and another,’ I said. ‘Please, Makar Alekseyevich, old chap, give me something, however little, even if it’s just ten copecks,’ he replied. Well, little mother, I took my twenty copecks out of my money-box and gave it to him: it was my good deed for the day! Oh, poverty! I engaged him in conversation. ‘How is it, old chap, that you’re in such a plight, yet you’re renting a room that costs five silver rubles a month?’ He explained to me that he had taken the room six months earlier and had paid three months’ rent in advance; then, however, circumstances had conspired against him in such a way that he did not know which way to turn, poor fellow. He had hoped that his case would be settled by this time. But it’s an unsavoury sort of case he is got himself into. You see, Varenka, he is up before the courts for something. he is litigating with some merchant or other who swindled the state authorities over the matter of a contract; the deception was found out and the merchant was arrested, but he managed to implicate Gorshkov in his criminal deeds, and Gorshkov was in some way involved in them. But in actual fact Gorshkov was only guilty of negligence, imprudence and inexcusable dereliction of the state is interests. The case has been going on for several years now: various obstacles keep cropping up in Gorshkov is way, making it impossible for him to clear his name. ‘ As regards the dishonesty of which I’m accused,’ Gorshkov tells me, ‘I’m not guilty, not guilty at all, and I’m not guilty of swindling and robbery either.’ This case has besmirched his reputation somewhat; he has been fired from the service, and although he has not been found guilty of any crime on the statute-books, until he has been completely acquitted he can’t get back from the merchant a certain whopping sum of money which he is owed and which is now the subject of a court dispute. I believe him, but the court won’t accept his word for it; it’s one of those cases in which there are so many ins and outs that you’d never unravel them all in a hundred years. No sooner have a few of them been ironed out than the merchant produces some more. I feel really sorry for Gorshkov, my dear, and I know what he is going through. The man has no job; no one will take him on because of his unreliable reputation; they’ve used up all the money they had saved, on food; the case is full of complications, yet meanwhile they needed to live; and meanwhile, without particular intention on their part, and quite unsuitably, a child was born – well, that involved expense; the son fell ill – more expense, and died – yet more expense; his wife is ill; she has some chronic ailment or other: in other words he is been suffering, suffering badly. He says, however, that he expects a satis-factory decision on his case in a few days’ time, and that this time there can be no doubt of it whatsoever. I felt sorry, sorry, oh, so sorry for him, little mother! I showed him kindness. he is a lost, frightened man; he is looking for someone to look after him, and that is why I showed him kindness. Well, goodbye, little mother, Christ be with you, keep well. My little dove! I have only to remember you, and it is like having a medicine applied to my sick soul, and even though I suffer for you, that suffering is easy for me.","I went home in a melancholy frame of mind; I sat down to the table and heated my teapot to have a glass or two of tea. Suddenly I saw coming towards me Gorshkov, our poor lodger. I had noticed in the morning that he kept hanging about round the other lodgers, and trying to approach me. And I may say, in passing, Varinka, that they live ever so much worse than I do. Yes, indeed, he has a wife and children! So that if I were in his place I don’t know what I should do. Well, my Gorshkov comes up to me, bows to me, a running tear as always on his eyelashes, he scrapes with his foot and can’t utter a word. I made him sit down on a chair—it was a broken one, it is true, but there was no other. I offered him some tea. He refused from politeness, refused for a long time, but at last he took a glass. He would have drunk it without sugar, began apologising again, when I tried to persuade him that he must have sugar; he argued for a long time, kept refusing, but at last put the very smallest lump of sugar in his glass, and began declaring that his tea was extremely sweet. Oh, to what degradation poverty does reduce people! “ Well, my good friend, what is it?” I said. “Well, it is like this, Makar Alexyevitch, my benefactor,” he said, “show the mercy of the Lord, come to the help of my unhappy family ; my wife and children have nothing to eat; think what it is for me, their father,” said he. I tried to speak, but he interrupted me. “I am afraid of everyone here, Makar Alexyevitch—that is, not exactly afraid but as it were ashamed with them; they are all proud and haughty people. I would not have troubled you, my benefactor, I know that you have been in difficulties yourself , I know you can’t give me much, but do lend me a trifle, and I make bold to ask you,” said he, “because I know your kind heart. I know that you are in need yourself, that you know what trouble is now, and so your heart feels compassion.” He ended by saying, “Forgive my boldness and unmannerliness, Makar Alexyevitch.” I answered him that I should be heartily glad, but that I had nothing, absolutely nothing. “Makar Alexyevitch, sir,” said he, “I am not asking for much, but you see it is like this—(then he flushed crimson)—my wife, my children, hungry—if only a ten-kopeck piece.” Well, it sent a twinge to my heart. Why, I thought, they are worse off than I, even. Twenty kopecks was all I had left, and I was reckoning on it. I meant to spend it next day on my most pressing needs. “No, my dear fellow, I can’t, it is like this,” I said. “Makar Alexyevitch, my dear soul, what you like,” he said, “if it is only ten kopecks.” Well, I took my twenty kopecks out of my box, Varinka, and gave it him; it’s a good deed anyway! Ah! poverty! I had a good talk with him: “Why, how is it, my good soul,” I said, “that you are in such want and yet you rent a room for five silver roubles?” He explained to me that he had taken it six months before and paid for it six months in advance; and since then circumstances had been such that the poor fellow does not know which way to turn. He expected his case would be over by this time. It’s an unpleasant business. You see, Varinka, he has to answer for something before the court, he is mixed up in a case with a merchant who swindled the government over a contract; the cheat was discovered and the merchant was arrested and he’s managed to implicate Gorshkov, who had something to do with it, too. But in reality Gorshkov was only guilty of negligence, of injudiciousness and unpardonable disregard of the interests of government. The case has been going on for some years. Gorshkov has had to face all sorts of difficulties. “I’m not guilty, not in the least guilty of the dishonesty attributed to me,” said Gorshkov; “I am not guilty of swindling and robbery.” This case has thrown a slur on his character; he has been turned out of the service, and though he has not been found guilty of any legal crime, yet, till he has completely cleared himself he cannot recover from the merchant a considerable sum of money due to him which is now the subject of dispute before the courts. I believe him, but the court won’t take his word for it; the case is all in such a coil and a tangle that it would take a hundred years to unravel it. As soon as they untie one knot the merchant brings forward another and then another. I feel the deepest sympathy for Gorshkov, my own, I am very sorry for him. The man’s out of work, he won’t be taken anywhere without a character; all they had saved has been spent on food, the case is complicated and, meanwhile, they have had to live, and meanwhile, apropos of nothing and most inappropriately, a baby has been born, and that is an expense; his son fell ill—expense; died—expense; his wife is ill; he’s afflicted with some disease of long standing—in fact, he has suffered, he has suffered to the utmost; he says, however, that he is expecting a favourable conclusion to his business in a day or two and that there is no doubt of it now. I am sorry for him, I am sorry for him; I am very sorry for him, Varinka. I was kind to him, he’s a poor lost, scared creature; he needs a friend so I was kind to him. Well, good-bye, my dear one, Christ be with you, keep well. My darling! when I think of you it’s like laying a salve on my sore heart. And though I suffer for you, yet it eases my heart to suffer for you."
"Милостивый государь, Макар Алексеевич!","Dear sir, Makar Alekseevich!",MY DEAREST MAKAR,"Makar Alekseyevich, Sir,","DEAR SIR, MAKAR DYEVUSHKIN,"
"Но как же мне стало досадно, когда я, придя в нашу комнату, торопливо развернула книгу и увидала какое-то старое, полусгнившее, все изъеденное червями латинское сочинение. Я воротилась, не теряя времени. Только что я хотела поставить книгу на полку, послышался шум в коридоре и чьи-то близкие шаги. Я заспешила, заторопилась, но несносная книга была так плотно поставлена в ряд, что, когда я вынула одну, все остальные раздались сами собою и сплотнились так, что теперь для прежнего их товарища не оставалось более места. Втиснуть книгу у меня недоставало сил. Однако ж я толкнула книги как только могла сильнее. Ржавый гвоздь, на котором крепилась полка и который, кажется, нарочно ждал этой минуты, чтоб сломаться, – сломался. Полка полетела одним концом вниз. Книги с шумом посыпались на пол. Дверь отворилась, и Покровский вошел в комнату.","But how vexed I felt when, having come into our room, I hurriedly opened the book and saw some old, half-rotted, worm-eaten Latin work. I returned without wasting time. Just as I was about to put the book on the shelf, I heard a noise in the corridor and someone's close steps. I hurried, hurried, but the unbearable book was so densely arranged in a row that when I took out one, all the others were distributed by themselves and rallied so that now there was no more room for their former comrade. I didn't have the strength to squeeze the book in. However, I pushed the books as hard as I could. The rusty nail on which the shelf was fastened and which, it seems, deliberately waited for this moment to break, broke. The shelf flew one end down. Books fell noisily to the floor. The door opened and Pokrovsky entered the room.","But how vexed I felt when, on returning to our own room, and hastily turning the pages, only an old, battered worm-eaten Latin work greeted my eyes! Without loss of time I retraced my steps. Just when I was about to replace the book I heard a noise in the corridor outside, and the sound of footsteps approaching. Fumblingly I hastened to complete what I was about, but the tiresome book had become so tightly wedged into its row that, on being pulled out, it caused its fellows to close up too compactly to leave any place for their comrade. To insert the book was beyond my strength; yet still I kept pushing and pushing at the row. At last the rusty nail which supported the shelf (the thing seemed to have been waiting on purpose for that moment!) broke off short; with the result that the shelf descended with a crash, and the books piled themselves in a heap on the floor! Then the door of the room opened, and Pokrovski entered!","Great, however, was my disappointment when, on regaining our room, I hurriedly opened the book and discovered that it was some ancient, semi-decomposed, utterly worm-eaten treatise in Latin. I lost no time in taking it back. Just as I was about to replace the book on its shelf, I heard a noise in the corridor, and someone’s footsteps, quite close. I tried to be as quick as I could, but the wretched book had been so firmly wedged in its row that when I took it out all the others displaced themselves and closed ranks in such a way that there was now no room for their former companion. I had not the strength to squeeze the book back in. But I did push the other books back as hard as I was able. The rusty nail by which the shelf was fixed to the wall and which seemed to have been awaiting precisely that moment in order to snap, snapped. The shelf collapsed at one end, and the books went noisily scattering all over the floor. The door opened, and Pokrovsky entered the room.","But what was my vexation when, returning to our room, I hurriedly opened the book and saw it was some old work in Latin. It was half decayed and worm-eaten. I went back without loss of time. Just as I was trying to put the book back in the shelf I heard a noise in the passage and approaching footsteps. I tried with nervous haste to be quick, but the insufferable book had been so tightly wedged in the shelf that when I took it out all the others had shifted and packed closer of themselves, so now there was no room for their former companion. I had not the strength to force the book in. I pushed the books with all my might, however. The rusty nail which supported the shelf, and which seemed to be waiting for that moment to break, broke. One end of the shelf fell down. The books dropped noisily on the floor in all directions. The door opened and Pokrovsky walked into the room."
"Говорил я про «Станционного смотрителя» Ратазяеву. Он мне сказал, что это все старое и что теперь всё пошли книжки с картинками и с разными описаниями; уж я, право, в толк не взял хорошенько, что он тут говорил такое. Заключил же, что Пушкин хорош и что он святую Русь прославил, и много еще мне про него говорил. Да, очень хорошо, Варенька, очень хорошо; прочтите-ка книжку еще раз со вниманием, советам моим последуйте и послушанием своим меня, старика, осчастливьте. Тогда сам господь наградит вас, моя родная, непременно наградит.","I spoke about the ""Station Master"" Ratazyaeva. He told me that it was all old and that now everything has gone to books with pictures and different descriptions; really, I really didn’t understand well that he said such a thing here. I concluded that Pushkin was good and that he glorified Holy Russia, and told me a lot more about him. Yes, very good, Varenka, very good; read the book again with attention, follow my advice and make me, an old man, happy with your obedience. Then the Lord himself will reward you, my dear, will certainly reward you.","I have spoken of Rataziaev’s “The Station Overseer”. However, the author has told me that the work is old-fashioned, since, nowadays, books are issued with illustrations and embellishments of different sorts (though I could not make out all that he said). Pushkin he adjudges a splendid poet, and one who has done honour to Holy Russia. Read your book again, Barbara, and follow my advice, and make an old man happy. The Lord God Himself will reward you. Yes, He will surely reward you.—Your faithful friend,","I spoke of The Stationmaster to Ratazyayev. He told me that was all old hat, and said that the vogue now was for books with illustrations and various kinds of description; * actually, I did not really quite grasp what he was talking about. He ended by saying that Pushkin was good and that he brought fame to Holy Russia, and told me a lot of other things about him. Yes, it’s very good, Varenka, very good; read your book once again carefully, follow the advice I have given you and make me happy by your obedience, old man that I am.

"Он заболел два месяца спустя после последних происшествий, мною здесь описанных. В эти два месяца он неутомимо хлопотал о способах жизни, ибо до сих пор он еще не имел определенного положения. Как и все чахоточные, он не расставался до последней минуты своей с надеждою жить очень долго. Ему выходило куда-то место в учителя; но к этому ремеслу он имел отвращение. Служить где-нибудь в казенном месте он не мог за нездоровьем. К тому же долго бы нужно было ждать первого оклада жалованья. Короче, Покровский видел везде только одни неудачи; характер его портился. Здоровье его расстраивалось; он этого не примечал. Подступила осень. Каждый день выходил он в своей легкой шинельке хлопотать по своим делам, просить и вымаливать себе где-нибудь места, – что его внутренне мучило; промачивал ноги, мок под дождем и наконец слег в постель, с которой не вставал уже более… Он умер в глубокую осень, в конце октября месяца.","He fell ill two months after the last incidents I have described here. During these two months he busied himself indefatigably about ways of life, for up to now he had not yet had a definite position. Like all consumptives, he did not part until his last minute with the hope of living a very long time. He looked like a place in a teacher; but he had an aversion to this trade. He could not serve anywhere in a state-owned place due to ill health. In addition, it would take a long time to wait for the first salary. In short, Pokrovsky saw everywhere only failures; his character deteriorated. His health was failing; he did not notice it. Autumn has come. Every day he went out in his light overcoat to go about his business, begging and begging for a place for himself somewhere - which tormented him inwardly; he wet his feet, got wet in the rain, and finally fell into bed, from which he no longer got up ... He died in the deep autumn, at the end of October.","My misfortunes began with the illness and death of Pokrovski, who was taken worse two months after what I have last recorded in these memoirs. During those two months he worked hard to procure himself a livelihood since hitherto he had had no assured position. Like all consumptives, he never—not even up to his last moment—altogether abandoned the hope of being able to enjoy a long life. A post as tutor fell in his way, but he had never liked the profession; while for him to become a civil servant was out of the question, owing to his weak state of health. Moreover, in the latter capacity he would have had to have waited a long time for his first instalment of salary. Again, he always looked at the darker side of things, for his character was gradually being warped, and his health undermined by his illness, though he never noticed it. Then autumn came on, and daily he went out to business—that is to say, to apply for and to canvass for posts—clad only in a light jacket; with the result that, after repeated soakings with rain, he had to take to his bed, and never again left it. He died in mid-autumn at the close of the month of October.","He fell ill two months after the latest events I have described. During those two months he had been tirelessly waging a struggle for the means of subsistence, for he still had no reliable position. He was offered a schoolmaster’s job somewhere; but he had an aversion for that trade. He was unable, on account of his poor health, to serve in a government position anywhere. In addition, he would have had to wait too long for the first instalment of his salary. In short, Pokrovsky met with lack of success wherever he turned; he was losing his good spirits. His health was going from bad to worse, but he gave it no attention. Every day he would go out in his thin overcoat to chase up his business, to ask and beg for a job somewhere, anywhere – something that caused him inner torture; he would get his feet wet, be soaked in the rain and, at last, had to take to his bed, from which he never got up again… He died in the depths of autumn, at the end of October.","He fell ill about two months after the last incidents I have described here. He spent those two months in unceasing efforts to secure some means of subsistence, for he still had no settled position. Like all consumptives he clung up to the very last moment to the hope of a very long life. A post as a teacher turned up for him, but he had a great distaste for that calling. He could not take a place in a government office on account of his health. Besides, he would have had to wait a long time for the first instalment of his salary. In short, Pokrovsky met with nothing but disappointment on all sides and this tried his temper. His health was suffering, but he paid no attention to it. Autumn was coming on, every day he went out in his thin little overcoat to try and get work, to beg and implore for a place, which was inwardly an agony to him; he used to get his feet wet and to be soaked through with the rain, and at last he took to his bed and never got up from it again.... He died in the middle of autumn at the end of October."

"Как я благодарна вам за вчерашнюю прогулку на острова, Макар Алексеевич! Как там свежо, хорошо, какая там зелень! Я так давно не видала зелени; когда я была больна, мне все казалось, что я умереть должна и что умру непременно; судите же, что я должна была вчера ощущать, как чувствовать! Вы не сердитесь на меня за то, что я была вчера такая грустная; мне было очень хорошо, очень легко, но в самые лучшие минуты мои мне всегда отчего-то грустно. А что я плакала, так это пустяки; я и сама не знаю, отчего я все плачу. Я больно, раздражительно чувствую; впечатления мои болезненны. Безоблачное, бледное небо, закат солнца, вечернее затишье – все это, – я уж не знаю, – но я как-то настроена была вчера принимать все впечатления тяжело и мучительно, так что сердце переполнялось и душа просила слез. Но зачем я вам все это пишу? Все это трудно сердцу сказывается, а пересказывать еще труднее. Но вы меня, может быть, и поймете. И грусть и смех! Какой вы, право, добрый, Макар Алексеевич! Вчера вы так и смотрели мне в глаза, чтоб прочитать в них то, что я чувствую, и восхищались восторгом моим. Кусточек ли, аллея, полоса воды – уж вы тут; так и стоите передо мной, охорашиваясь, и все в глаза мне заглядываете, точно вы мне свои владения показывали. Это доказывает, что у вас доброе сердце, Макар Алексеевич. За это-то я вас и люблю. Ну, прощайте. Я сегодня опять больна; вчера я ноги промочила и оттого простудилась; Федора тоже чем-то больна, так что мы обе теперь хворые. Не забывайте меня, заходите почаще.","How grateful I am to you for yesterday's trip to the islands, Makar Alekseevich! How fresh it is, well, what greenery there! I haven't seen green for so long; when I was ill, it always seemed to me that I must die and that I would certainly die; Judge what I must have felt yesterday, how to feel! You are not angry with me because I was so sad yesterday; I felt very good, very light, but in my best moments I always feel sad for some reason. And what I cried is nothing; I don't even know why I'm crying. I feel painful, irritable; my impressions are painful. A cloudless, pale sky, a sunset, an evening calm - all this - I don’t know - but somehow I was in the mood yesterday to take all the impressions hard and painfully, so that my heart overflowed and my soul asked for tears. But why am I writing all this to you? All this is hard on the heart, and even harder to retell. But you might understand me. And sadness and laughter! How kind you really are, Makar Alekseevich! Yesterday you just looked into my eyes to read what I feel in them, and admired my delight. Is it a small piece, an alley, a strip of water - you are already here; so you stand in front of me, preening, and you all look into my eyes, as if you were showing me your possessions. This proves that you have a good heart, Makar Alekseevich. That's why I love you. Well, goodbye. I am sick again today; yesterday I got my feet wet and that's why I caught a cold; Fedora is also sick with something, so we are both sick now. Don't forget me, come back often.","How I thank you for our walk to the Islands yesterday, Makar Alexievitch! How fresh and pleasant, how full of verdure, was everything! And I had not seen anything green for such a long time! During my illness I used to think that I should never get better, that I was certainly going to die. Judge, then, how I felt yesterday! True, I may have seemed to you a little sad, and you must not be angry with me for that. Happy and light-hearted though I was , there were moments, even at the height of my felicity, when, for some unknown reason, depression came sweeping over my soul. I kept weeping about trifles, yet could not say why I was grieved. The truth is that I am unwell—so much so, that I look at everything from the gloomy point of view. The pale, clear sky, the setting sun, the evening stillness—ah, somehow I felt disposed to grieve and feel hurt at these things; my heart seemed to be over-charged, and to be calling for tears to relieve it. But why should I write this to you? It is difficult for my heart to express itself; still more difficult for it to forego self-expression. Yet possibly you may understand me. Tears and laughter!... How good you are, Makar Alexievitch! Yesterday you looked into my eyes as though you could read in them all that I was feeling—as though you were rejoicing at my happiness. Whether it were a group of shrubs or an alleyway or a vista of water that we were passing, you would halt before me, and stand gazing at my face as though you were showing me possessions of your own. It told me how kind is your nature, and I love you for it. Today I am again unwell, for yesterday I wetted my feet, and took a chill. Thedora also is unwell; both of us are ailing. Do not forget me. Come and see me as often as you can.—Your own,","How grateful I am to you for our walk to the islands yesterday, Makar Alekseyevich! How fresh and pleasant it is there, such greenness! It is so long since I saw green nature; when I was ill I kept thinking that I was going to die, and that my death was certain; imagine, then, what I experienced yesterday, how I felt! Do not be too cross with me for being so sad yesterday ; I felt very good, very much at ease – but for some reason at those moments of my life when I feel best I am always sad. As for my crying, that was just nonsense; I myself do not know why I am forever crying. My emotions are painful and exasperating; I have a morbid sensibility. The sky was pale and cloudless, the sun was setting, the evening was quiet – all that – yet I do not know how it was: yesterday my mood made me experience everything as being painful and tormenting, so that my heart overflowed and my soul begged for tears. But why am I writing you all this? These are things that communicate themselves to the heart only with difficulty, and to communicate them to others is even harder. But you, perhaps, will understand me. Sadness and laughter at the same time! Truly, what a good man you are, Makar Alekseyevich! Yesterday you really looked into my eyes in order to read in them what I was feeling, and you were delighted by my enthusiasm. Whether it was a shrub, an avenue of trees, or a stretch of water – you were there; so nobly you stood before me, making yourself look handsome, and constantly glancing into my eyes as though you were showing me your estate. That proves you have a good heart, Makar Alekseyevich. It is for that that I love you. Well, goodbye. I’m not well again today; yesterday I got my feet wet and have caught a cold; Fedora is also unwell with something, so together we make a pair of invalids. Do not forget me, come and see me more often.","How grateful I am to you for our walk yesterday to the Island, Makar Alexyevitch! How fresh and lovely it is there, how leafy and green! It’s so long since I saw green leaves—when I was ill I kept fancying that I had to die and that I certainly should die— judge what must have been my sensations yesterday, how I must have felt ... You must not be angry with me for having been so sad yesterday; I was very happy, very content, but in my very best moments I am always for some reason sad. As for my crying, that means nothing. I don’t know myself why I am always crying. I feel ill and irritable; my sensations are due to illness. The pale cloudless sky, the sunset, the evening stillness—all that —I don’t know— but I was somehow in the mood yesterday to take a dreary and miserable view of everything, so that my heart was too full and needed the relief of tears. But why am I writing all this to you? It is hard to make all that clear to one’s own heart and still harder to convey it to another. But you, perhaps, will understand me. Sadness and laughter both at once! How kind you are really, Makar Alexyevitch! You looked into my eyes yesterday as though to read in them what I was feeling and were delighted with my rapture. Whether it was a bush, an avenue, a piece of water—you were there standing before me showing its beauties and peeping into my eyes as though you were displaying your possessions to me. That proves that you have a kind heart, Makar Alexyevitch. It’s for that that I love you. Well, goodbye. I’m ill again to-day; I got my feet wet yesterday and have caught cold. Fedora is ailing, too, so now we are both on the sick list. Don’t forget me. Come as often as you can."

"Изъявляете желание, маточка, в подробности узнать о моем житье-бытье и обо всем меня окружающем. С радостию спешу исполнить ваше желание, родная моя. Начну сначала, маточка: больше порядку будет. Во-первых, в доме у нас, на чистом входе, лестницы весьма посредственные; особливо парадная – чистая, светлая, широкая, все чугун да красное дерево. Зато уж про черную и не спрашивайте: винтовая, сырая, грязная, ступеньки поломаны, и стены такие жирные, что рука прилипает, когда на них опираешься. На каждой площадке стоят сундуки, стулья и шкафы поломанные, ветошки развешаны, окна повыбиты; лоханки стоят со всякою нечистью, с грязью, с сором, с яичною скорлупою да с рыбьими пузырями; запах дурной… одним словом, нехорошо.","You express a desire, mother, to learn in detail about my life and everything around me. With joy I hasten to fulfill your desire, my dear. I'll start over, mother: there will be more order. Firstly, in our house, at the clean entrance, the stairs are very mediocre; especially the front one - clean, bright, wide, all cast iron and mahogany. But don’t even ask about the black one: it’s winding, damp, dirty, the steps are broken, and the walls are so greasy that your hand sticks when you lean on them. On each platform there are chests, broken chairs and cupboards, rags are hung out, windows are smashed; pelvises stand with all sorts of unclean things, with dirt, with rubbish, with eggshells and with fish bubbles; bad smell ... in a word, not good.","Dearest, you also express a wish to learn the details of my daily life and surroundings. That wish I hasten to satisfy. Let me begin at the beginning, since, by doing so, I shall explain things more systematically. In the first place, on entering this house, one passes into a very bare hall, and thence along a passage to a mean staircase. The reception room, however, is bright, clean, and spacious, and is lined with redwood and metal-work. But the scullery you would not care to see; it is greasy, dirty, and odoriferous, while the stairs are in rags, and the walls so covered with filth that the hand sticks fast wherever it touches them. Also, on each landing there is a medley of boxes, chairs, and dilapidated wardrobes; while the windows have had most of their panes shattered, and everywhere stand washtubs filled with dirt, litter, eggshells, and fish-bladders. The smell is abominable. In short, the house is not a nice one.","You express the wish, little mother, to learn the details of my everyday life and all that surrounds me. With joy I hasten to carry out your wish, my darling. I shall begin from the beginning, dearest: that way it will be more orderly! In the first instance, the staircases at the front side of our house are positively handsome; the main staircase is particularly so – it is clean, light, wide, all cast-iron and mahogany. On the other hand, don’t inquire about the back stairs: they are winding, damp and dirty, with steps broken and the walls so greasy that your hand sticks when you lean against them. On every landing there are chests, broken chairs and cupboards, old clothes hung up, windows with panes knocked out; tubs stand around filled with all kinds of evil stuff: dirt, sweepings, eggshells and fishes’ bladders; a bad smell… in short – nasty. I have already described the arrangement of the rooms; there is no denying that it is a convenient one – that is true, but for some reason they are rather stuffy; it’s not that there ’s a bad smell as such – there’s rather, if I may put it this way, a slightly rotten, sweet-sour smell.","You express the desire, dear Varinka, to have a full account of my daily life and all my surroundings. I gladly hasten to carry out your wish, my dear. I will begin from the beginning, my love: it will be more orderly. To begin with, the staircases to the front entrance are very passable in our house; especially the main staircase —it is clean, light, wide, all cast-iron and mahogany, but don’t ask about the backstairs: winding like a screw, damp, dirty, with steps broken and the walls so greasy that your hand sticks when you lean against them. On every landing there are boxes, broken chairs and cupboards, rags hung out, windows broken, tubs stand about full of all sorts of dirt and litter, eggshells and the refuse of fish; there is a horrid smell ... in fact it is not nice."
"Хочу писать, а не знаю, с чего и начать. Ведь вот как же это странно, маточка, что мы теперь так с вами живем. Я к тому говорю, что я никогда моих дней не проводил в такой радости. Ну, точно домком и семейством меня благословил господь! Деточка вы моя, хорошенькая! да что это вы там толкуете про четыре рубашечки-то, которые я вам послал. Ведь надобно же вам их было, – я от Федоры узнал. Да мне, маточка, это особое счастие вас удовлетворять; уж это мое удовольствие, уж вы меня оставьте, маточка; не троньте меня и не прекословьте мне. Никогда со мною не бывало такого, маточка. Я вот в свет пустился теперь. Во-первых, живу вдвойне, потому что и вы тоже живете весьма близко от меня и на утеху мне; а во-вторых, пригласил меня сегодня на чай один жилец, сосед мой, Ратазяев, тот самый чиновник, у которого сочинительские вечера бывают. Сегодня собрание; будем литературу читать. Вот мы теперь как, маточка, – вот! Ну, прощайте. Я ведь это все так написал, безо всякой видимой цели и единственно для того, чтоб уведомить вас о моем благополучии. Приказали вы, душенька, через Терезу сказать, что вам шелчку цветного для вышиванья нужно; куплю, маточка, куплю, и шелчку куплю. Завтра же буду иметь наслаждение удовлетворить вас вполне. Я и купить-то где знаю. А сам теперь пребываю","I want to write, but I don't know where to start. After all, that's how strange it is, mother, that we now live like this with you. I say that I have never spent my days in such joy. Well, as if the house committee and the family blessed me with the Lord! You are my pretty baby! what are you talking about about the four shirts that I sent you. After all, you needed them, - I learned from Fedora. Yes, to me, mother, it is a special happiness to satisfy you; this is my pleasure, you leave me alone, mother; do not touch me and do not rebuke me. This has never happened to me, mother.

You ordered, my dear, to tell Teresa that you need colored silk for embroidery; I’ll buy, mother, I’ll buy, and I’ll buy silk. Tomorrow I shall have the pleasure of satisfying you completely. I know where to buy. And now I am staying","MY OWN, MY DARLING,—I wish to write to you, yet know not where to begin. Things are as strange as though we were actually living together. Also I would add that never in my life have I passed such happy days as I am spending at present. ‘ Tis as though God had blessed me with a home and a family of my own! Yes, you are my little daughter, beloved. But why mention the four sorry roubles that I sent you? You needed them; I know that from Thedora herself, and it will always be a particular pleasure to me to gratify you in anything. It will always be my one happiness in life. Pray, therefore, leave me that happiness, and do not seek to cross me in it. Things are not as you suppose. I have now reached the sunshine since, in the first place, I am living so close to you as almost to be with you (which is a great consolation to my mind), while, in the second place, a neighbour of mine named Rataziaev (the retired official who gives the literary parties) has today invited me to tea. This evening, therefore, there will be a gathering at which we shall discuss literature! Think of that my darling! Well, goodbye now. I have written this without any definite aim in my mind, but solely to assure you of my welfare. Through Theresa I have received your message that you need an embroidered cloak to wear, so I will go and purchase one. Yes, tomorrow I mean to purchase that embroidered cloak, and so give myself the pleasure of having satisfied one of your wants. I know where to go for such a garment. For the time being I remain your sincere friend,","I want to write to you, but don’t know how to start. I mean, it’s so strange that we are living so close to each other now.

What is this you write about the four chemises I sent you? After all, you needed them – I discovered that from Fedora. Pleasing you is an especial happiness for me, little mother; that is my pleasure, and you must leave me to it, little mother; do not come near me and do not gainsay me. Never have I experienced anything like this, little mother. I have launched myself into society now. For one thing, I am living at double intensity, because you are living so close to me and making me so happy; for another, I have been invited to tea today by one of the lodgers, my neighbour, Ratazyayev, the same clerk who holds the literary evenings. There is to be one of those today; we are going to read literature. So you see how I am now, little mother – you see! Well, goodbye. I’ve really just written this without any particular purpose and solely in order to let you know how well I am. My darling, you told Teresa to tell me that you needed some coloured silk for your embroidery; I shall buy it, little mother, I shall buy you the silk, too.

"Я вся в ужасном волнении. Послушайте-ка, что у нас было. Я что-то роковое предчувствую. Вот посудите сами, мой бесценный друг: господин Быков в Петербурге. Федора его встретила. Он ехал, приказал остановить дрожки, подошел сам к Федоре и стал наведываться, где она живет. Та сначала не сказывала. Потом он сказал, усмехаясь, что он знает, кто у ней живет. (Видно, Анна Федоровна все ему рассказала). Тогда Федора не вытерпела и тут же на улице стала его упрекать, укорять, сказала ему, что он человек безнравственный, что он причина всех несчастий моих. Он отвечал, что когда гроша нет, так, разумеется, человек несчастлив. Федора сказала ему, что я бы сумела прожить работою, могла бы выйти замуж, а не то так сыскать место какое-нибудь, а что теперь счастие мое навсегда потеряно, что я к тому же больна и скоро умру. На это он заметил, что я еще слишком молода, что у меня еще в голове бродит и что и наши добродетели потускнели (его слова). Мы с Федорой думали, что он не знает нашей квартиры, как вдруг вчера, только что я вышла для закупок в Гостиный двор, он входит к нам в комнату; ему, кажется, не хотелось застать меня дома. Он долго расспрашивал Федору о нашем житье-бытье; все рассматривал у нас; мою работу смотрел, наконец спросил: «Какой же это чиновник, который с вами знаком?» На ту пору вы чрез двор проходили; Федора ему указала на вас; он взглянул и усмехнулся; Федора упрашивала его уйти, сказала ему, что я и так уже нездорова от огорчений и что видеть его у нас мне будет весьма неприятно. Он промолчал; сказал, что он так приходил, от нечего делать, и хотел дать Федоре двадцать пять рублей; та, разумеется, не взяла. Что бы это значило? Зачем это он приходил к нам? Я понять не могу, откуда он все про нас знает! Я теряюсь в догадках. Федора говорит, что Аксинья, ее золовка, которая ходит к нам, знакома с прачкой Настасьей, а Настасьин двоюродный брат сторожем в том департаменте, где служит знакомый племянника Анны Федоровны, так вот не переползла ли как-нибудь сплетня? Впрочем, очень может быть, что Федора и ошибается; мы не знаем, что придумать. Неужели он к нам опять придет! Одна мысль эта ужасает меня! Когда Федора рассказала все это вчера, так я так испугалась, что чуть было в обморок не упала от страха. Чего еще им надобно? Я теперь их знать не хочу! Что им за дело до меня, бедной! Ах! в каком я страхе теперь; так вот и думаю, что войдет сию минуту Быков. Что со мною будет! Что еще мне готовит судьба? Ради Христа, зайдите ко мне теперь же, Макар Алексеевич. Зайдите, ради бога, зайдите.","I am in terrible agitation. Listen to what we had. I foresee something fatal. Judge for yourself, my priceless friend: Mr. Bykov is in St. Petersburg. Fedora met him. He was driving, ordered the droshky to stop, went up to Fedora himself and began to visit where she lives. She didn't say at first. Then he said, grinning, that he knew who lived with her. (Apparently, Anna Fyodorovna told him everything). Then Fyodor could not bear it, and right there on the street she began to reproach him, reproach him, told him that he was an immoral person, that he was the cause of all my misfortunes. He answered that when there is no penny, then, of course, a person is unhappy. Fyodor told him that I could make a living by working, I could get married, otherwise I could find a job somewhere, but that now my happiness was lost forever, that, moreover, I was sick and would soon die. To this, he remarked that I was still too young, that my head was still wandering, and that our virtues had faded (his words). Fedora and I thought that he did not know our apartment, when suddenly yesterday, as soon as I went out to Gostiny Dvor for purchases, he enters our room; he didn't seem to want to find me at home. He asked Fyodor for a long time about our life; everything was considered by us; looked at my work, finally asked: “What kind of official is this, who is familiar with you?” At that time you passed through the yard; Fyodor pointed you out to him; he looked and smiled; Fyodor begged him to leave, told him that I was already unwell from grief and that it would be very unpleasant for me to see him with us. He said nothing; he said that he used to come like that, having nothing to do, and wanted to give Fyodor twenty-five rubles; She, of course, didn't take it. What would that mean? Why did he come to us? I can't figure out how he knows everything about us! I'm at a loss. Fyodor says that Aksinya, her sister-in-law, who visits us, is acquainted with the laundress Nastasya, and that Nastasya's cousin is a watchman in the department where an acquaintance of Anna Fedorovna's nephew serves, so hasn't gossip somehow crept in? However, it is very possible that Fyodor is mistaken; we don't know what to think. Is he coming back to us? This thought alone terrifies me! When Fedora told me all this yesterday, I was so frightened that I almost fainted from fear. What else do they need? Now I don't want to know! What do they care about me, poor thing! Oh! in what fear am I now; so I think that Bykov will come in this minute. What will happen to me! What else does fate have in store for me? For Christ's sake, come to me now, Makar Alekseevich. Come in, for God's sake, come in.","MY DEAREST MAKAR ALEXIEVITCH,—I am in terrible distress. I feel sure that something is about to happen. The matter, my beloved friend, is that Monsieur Bwikov is again in St. Petersburg, for Thedora has met him. He was driving along in a drozhki, but, on meeting Thedora, he ordered the coachman to stop, sprang out, and inquired of her where she was living; but this she would not tell him. Next, he said with a smile that he knew quite well who was living with her (evidently Anna Thedorovna had told him); whereupon Thedora could hold out no longer, but then and there, in the street, railed at and abused him—telling him that he was an immoral man, and the cause of all my misfortunes. To this he replied that a person who did not possess a groat must surely be rather badly off; to which Thedora retorted that I could always either live by the labour of my hands or marry—that it was not so much a question of my losing posts as of my losing my happiness, the ruin of which had led almost to my death. In reply he observed that, though I was still quite young, I seemed to have lost my wits, and that my “virtue appeared to be under a cloud” (I quote his exact words). Both I and Thedora had thought that he does not know where I live; but, last night, just as I had left the house to make a few purchases in the Gostinni Dvor, he appeared at our rooms (evidently he had not wanted to find me at home), and put many questions to Thedora concerning our way of living. Then, after inspecting my work, he wound up with: “Who is this tchinovnik friend of yours?” At the moment you happened to be passing through the courtyard, so Thedora pointed you out, and the man peered at you, and laughed. Thedora next asked him to depart—telling him that I was still ill from grief, and that it would give me great pain to see him there; to which, after a pause, he replied that he had come because he had had nothing better to do. Also, he was for giving Thedora twenty-five roubles, but, of course, she declined them. What does it all mean? Why has he paid this visit? I cannot understand his getting to know about me. I am lost in conjecture. Thedora, however, says that Aksinia, her sister-in-law (who sometimes comes to see her), is acquainted with a laundress named Nastasia, and that this woman has a cousin in the position of watchman to a department of which a certain friend of Anna Thedorovna’s nephew forms one of the staff. Can it be, therefore, that an intrigue has been hatched through THIS channel? But Thedora may be entirely mistaken. We hardly know what to think. What if he should come again? The very thought terrifies me. When Thedora told me of this last night such terror seized upon me that I almost swooned away. What can the man be wanting? At all events, I refuse to know such people. What have they to do with my wretched self? Ah, how I am haunted with anxiety, for every moment I keep thinking that Bwikov is at hand! WHAT will become of me? WHAT MORE has fate in store for me? For Christ’s sake come and see me, Makar Alexievitch! For Christ’s sake come and see me soon!","I am in a dreadful state of agitation. Listen to what has happened to us. I have a premonition of something fateful. Judge for yourself, my precious friend: Mr Bykov is in St Petersburg. Fedora met him. He was driving by, ordered the droshky to stop, went up to Fedora himself and began to enquire where she lived. At first she wouldn’t oblige him. Then he told her with an ironic smile that he knew who was living with her. (Anna Fyodorovna had apparently told him everything.) Then Fedora lost her patience and began to upbraid him and reproach him right there on the street, telling him that he was a man with no morals, that it was he who was the cause of all my unhappiness. He replied that when people haven’t a copeck to their names they are bound to be unhappy. Fedora told him that I might well have been able to earn my living, might even have found a husband or, failing that, obtained a position somewhere, but that now my happiness was lost for ever, that I was ill, moreover, and would soon die. In reply to this he observed that I was still far too young, that my head was still in a ferment and that even our virtues were getting a little tarnished (his words). Fedora and I thought he didn’t know where our apartment was, but then suddenly, yesterday, just after I had gone out to do some shopping in the Gostiny Dvor, he walked into our room; he apparently wished to avoid me. He spent a long time asking Fedora questions about the life we were leading; he examined all our possessions, looked at my work, and then asked: ‘Who’s this clerk who knows you?’ At that moment you were crossing the yard; Fedora pointed you out to him; he looked, and smiled his ironic smile; Fedora begged him to go away, told him that I was already ill with distress as it was, and that to see him in our room would be very unpleasant for me. For a while he remained silent; then he said he had simply come to see us for want of anything better to do, and tried to give Fedora twenty-five rubles, which she of course refused. What would it have meant if she had accepted them? Why did he come to see us? I cannot fathom how it is that he knows all about us! I am lost in conjectures. Fedora says that her sister-in-law Aksinya who comes visiting us knows a washerwoman called Nastasya and that this Nastasya has a cousin who is a janitor in the same department where a friend of Anna Fyodorovna is nephew works – so isn’t it possible that some malicious gossip has been going the rounds? But it may very well be that Fedora is mistaken; we don’t know what to think. Will he really come to see us again? The very thought horrifies me! When Fedora told me all this yesterday I was so frightened that I nearly fainted from terror. What more does he want? I don’t want to know him now! What business does he have with me, poor woman that I am? Oh, in what fear I live now; I keep thinking that Bykov will come in at any moment. What is to become of me? What else does fate have in store for me? For the love of Christ, come and see me now, Makar Alekseyevich. Please, for the love of God, come and see me.","I feel dreadfully upset. Listen what has happened here. I foresee something momentous. Judge yourself, my precious friend; Mr. Bykov is in Petersburg, Fedora met him. He was driving, he ordered the cab to stop, went up to Fedora himself and began asking where she was living. At first she would not tell him. Then he said, laughing, that he knew who was living with her. (Evidently Anna Fyodorovna had told him all about it.) Then Fedora could not contain herself and began upbraiding him on the spot, in the street, reproaching him, telling him he was an immoral man and the cause of all my troubles. He answered, that one who has not a halfpenny is bound to have misfortunes. Fedora answered that I might have been able to earn my own living, that I might have been married or else have had some situation, but that now my happiness was wrecked for ever and that I was ill besides, and would not live long. To this he answered that I was still young, that I had still a lot of nonsense in my head and that my virtues were getting a little tarnished (his words). Fedora and I thought he did not know our lodging when suddenly, yesterday, just after I had gone out to buy some things in the Gostiny Dvor he walked into our room. I believe he did not want to find me at home. He questioned Fedora at length concerning our manner of life, examined everything we had; he looked at my work; at last asked, “Who is this clerk you have made friends with?” At that moment you walked across the yard; Fedora pointed to you; he glanced and laughed; Fedora begged him to go away, told him that I was unwell, as it was, from grieving, and that to see him in our room would be very distasteful to me. He was silent for a while; said that he had just looked in with no object and tried to give Fedora twenty-five roubles; she, of course, did not take it. What can it mean? What has he come to see us for? I cannot understand where he has found out all about us! I am lost in conjecture. Fedora says that Axinya, her sister-in-law, who comes to see us, is friendly with Nastasya the laundress, and Nastasya’s cousin is a porter in the office in which a friend of Anna Fyodorovna’s nephew is serving. So has not, perhaps, some ill-natured gossip crept round? But it is very possible that Fedora is mistaken; we don’t know what to think. Is it possible he will come to us again! The mere thought of it terrifies me! When Fedora told me all about it yesterday, I was so frightened that I almost fainted with terror! What more does he want? I don’t want to know him now! What does he want with me, poor me? Oh! I am in such terror now, I keep expecting Bykov to walk in every minute. What will happen to me, what more has fate in store for me? For Christ’s sake, come and see me now, Makar Alexyevitch. Do come, for God’s sake, come."
"Последние происшествия и письма ваши испугали, поразили меня и повергли в недоумение, а рассказы Федоры объяснили мне все. Но зачем же было так отчаиваться и вдруг упасть в такую бездну, в какую вы упали, Макар Алексеевич? Ваши объяснения вовсе не удовольствовали меня. Видите ли, была ли я права, когда настаивала взять то выгодное место, которое мне предлагали? К тому же и последнее мое приключение пугает меня не на шутку. Вы говорите, что любовь ваша ко мне заставила вас таиться от меня. Я и тогда уже видела, что многим обязана вам, когда вы уверяли, что издерживаете на меня только запасные деньги свои, которые, как говорили, у вас в ломбарде на всякий случай лежали. Теперь же, когда я узнала, что у вас вовсе не было никаких денег, что вы, случайно узнавши о моем бедственном положении и тронувшись им, решились издержать свое жалованье, забрав его вперед, и продали даже свое платье, когда я больна была, – теперь я, открытием всего этого, поставлена в такое мучительное положение, что до сих пор не знаю, как принять все это и что думать об этом. Ах! Макар Алексеевич! вы должны были остановиться на первых благодеяниях своих, внушенных вам состраданием и родственною любовью, а не расточать деньги впоследствии на ненужное. Вы изменили дружбе нашей, Макар Алексеевич, потому что не были откровенны со мною, и теперь, когда я вижу, что ваше последнее пошло мне на наряды, на конфекты, на прогулки, на театр и на книги, – то за все это я теперь дорого плачу сожалением о своей непростительной ветрености (ибо я принимала от вас все, не заботясь о вас самих); и все то, чем вы хотели доставить мне удовольствие, обратилось теперь в горе для меня и оставило по себе одно бесполезное сожаление. Я заметила вашу тоску в последнее время, и хотя сама тоскливо ожидала чего-то, но то, что случилось теперь, мне и в ум не входило. Как! вы до такой уже степени могли упасть духом, Макар Алексеевич! Но что теперь о вас подумают, что теперь скажут о вас все, кто вас знает? Вы, которого я и все уважали за доброту души, скромность и благоразумие, вы теперь вдруг впали в такой отвратительный порок, в котором, кажется, никогда не были замечены прежде. Что со мною было, когда Федора рассказала мне, что вас нашли на улице в нетрезвом виде и привезли на квартиру с полицией! Я остолбенела от изумления, хотя и ожидала чего-то необыкновенного, потому что вы четыре дня пропадали. Но подумали ли вы, Макар Алексеевич, что скажут ваши начальники, когда узнают настоящую причину вашего отсутствия? Вы говорите, что над вами смеются все; что все узнали о нашей связи и что и меня упоминают в насмешках своих соседи ваши. Не обращайте внимания на это, Макар Алексеевич, и ради бога успокойтесь. Меня пугает еще ваша история с этими офицерами; я об ней темно слышала. Растолкуйте мне, что это все значит? Пишете вы, что боялись открыться мне, боялись потерять вашим признанием мою дружбу, что были в отчаянии, не зная, чем помочь мне в моей болезни, что продали все, чтобы поддержать меня и не пускать в больницу, что задолжали сколько возможно задолжать, и имеете каждый день неприятности с хозяйкой, – но, скрывая все это от меня, вы выбрали худшее. Но ведь теперь же я все узнала. Вы совестились заставить меня сознаться, что я была причиною вашего несчастного положения, а теперь вдвое более принесли мне горя своим поведением. Все это меня поразило, Макар Алексеевич. Ах, друг мой! несчастие заразительная болезнь. Несчастным и бедным нужно сторониться друг от друга, чтоб еще более не заразиться. Я принесла вам такие несчастия, которых вы и не испытывали прежде в вашей скромной и уединенной жизни. Все это мучит и убивает меня.","The latest incidents and your letters frightened, struck me and plunged me into bewilderment, and Fedora's stories explained everything to me. But why did you have to despair so much and suddenly fall into such an abyss into which you fell, Makar Alekseevich? Your explanations did not please me at all. You see, was I right when I insisted on taking the advantageous place that was offered to me? In addition, my last adventure scares me in earnest. You say that your love for me has made you hide from me. Even then I already saw that I owed you a lot when you assured me that you were only spending your spare money on me, which, as they said, you had in the pawnshop just in case. Now, when I learned that you had no money at all, that you, having accidentally learned about my plight and moved by it, decided to spend your salary by taking it in advance, and even sold your dress when I was sick, - now, by the discovery of all this, I am placed in such a painful position that I still do not know how to accept all this and what to think about it. Oh! Makar Alekseevich! you should have stopped at your first good deeds, inspired by compassion and kindred love, and not later wasted money on unnecessary things. You betrayed our friendship, Makar Alekseevich, because you were not frank with me, and now, when I see that your last has gone to me for clothes, for sweets, for walks, for the theater and for books, then for all this I now I cry dearly with regret for my unforgivable frivolity (for I accepted everything from you, not caring about yourselves); and all that you wanted to give me pleasure has now turned into grief for me and left behind one useless regret. I have noticed your anguish lately, and although I myself drearily expected something, but what happened now did not even enter my mind. How! you could already lose heart to such an extent, Makar Alekseevich! But what will they think of you now, what will everyone who knows you say about you now? You, whom I and everyone respected for kindness of soul, modesty and prudence, you now suddenly fell into such a disgusting vice, in which, it seems, you have never been seen before. What happened to me when Fedora told me that you were found drunk on the street and brought to an apartment with the police! I was dumbfounded with amazement, although I expected something extraordinary, because you disappeared for four days. But have you thought, Makar Alekseevich, what your superiors will say when they find out the real reason for your absence? You say that everyone laughs at you; that everyone knew about our connection and that your neighbors mention me in their ridicule. Pay no attention to this, Makar Alekseevich, and for God's sake calm down. Your story with these officers also frightens me; I have heard a lot about her. Explain to me what it all means? You write that you were afraid to open up to me, that you were afraid to lose my friendship with your confession, that you were in despair, not knowing how to help me in my illness, that you sold everything to support me and not let me go to the hospital, that you owed as much debt as possible, and you have troubles with your landlady every day - but by hiding all this from me, you have chosen the worst. But now I know everything. You were ashamed to force me to confess that I was the cause of your unfortunate situation, and now you have brought me twice as much grief with your behavior. All this struck me, Makar Alekseevich. Ah, my friend! misfortune is a contagious disease. The unfortunate and the poor need to stay away from each other, so as not to become even more infected. I have brought you such misfortunes that you have not experienced before in your modest and solitary life. All this tortures and kills me.","had frightened me, and left me thunderstruck and plunged in doubt, until what you have said about Thedor explained the situation. Why despair and go into such frenzies, Makar Alexievitch? Your explanations only partially satisfy me. Perhaps I did wrong to insist upon accepting a good situation when it was offered me, seeing that from my last experience in that way I derived a shock which was anything but a matter for jesting. You say also that your love for me has compelled you to hide yourself in retirement. Now, how much I am indebted to you I realised when you told me that you were spending for my benefit the sum which you are always reported to have laid by at your bankers; but, now that I have learned that you never possessed such a fund, but that, on hearing of my destitute plight, and being moved by it, you decided to spend upon me the whole of your salary—even to forestall it—and when I had fallen ill, actually to sell your clothes—when I learned all this I found myself placed in the harassing position of not knowing how to accept it all, nor what to think of it. Ah, Makar Alexievitch! You ought to have stopped at your first acts of charity—acts inspired by sympathy and the love of kinsfolk, rather than have continued to squander your means upon what was unnecessary. Yes, you have betrayed our friendship, Makar Alexievitch, in that you have not been open with me; and, now that I see that your last coin has been spent upon dresses and bon-bons and excursions and books and visits to the theatre for me, I weep bitter tears for my unpardonable improvidence in having accepted these things without giving so much as a thought to your welfare. Yes, all that you have done to give me pleasure has become converted into a source of grief, and left behind it only useless regret. Of late I have remarked that you were looking depressed; and though I felt fearful that something unfortunate was impending, what has happened would otherwise never have entered my head. To think that your better sense should so play you false, Makar Alexievitch! What will people think of you, and say of you? Who will want to know you? You whom, like everyone else, I have valued for your goodness of heart and modesty and good sense— YOU, I say, have now given way to an unpleasant vice of which you seem never before to have been guilty. What were my feelings when Thedora informed me that you had been discovered drunk in the street, and taken home by the police? Why, I felt petrified with astonishment—although, in view of the fact that you had failed me for four days, I had been expecting some such extraordinary occurrence. Also, have you thought what your superiors will say of you when they come to learn the true reason of your absence? You say that everyone is laughing at you, that every one has learnt of the bond which exists between us, and that your neighbours habitually refer to me with a sneer. Pay no attention to this, Makar Alexievitch; for the love of God, be comforted. Also, the incident between you and the officers has much alarmed me, although I had heard certain rumours concerning it. Pray explain to me what it means. You write, too, that you have been afraid to be open with me, for the reason that your confessions might lose you my friendship. Also, you say that you are in despair at the thought of being unable to help me in my illness, owing to the fact that you have sold everything which might have maintained me, and preserved me in sickness, as well as that you have borrowed as much as it is possible for you to borrow, and are daily experiencing unpleasantness with your landlady. Well, in failing to reveal all this to me you chose the worse course. Now, however, I know all. You have forced me to recognise that I have been the cause of your unhappy plight, as well as that my own conduct has brought upon myself a twofold measure of sorrow. The fact leaves me thunderstruck, Makar Alexievitch. Ah, friend, an infectious disease is indeed a misfortune, for now we poor and miserable folk must perforce keep apart from one another, lest the infection be increased. Yes, I have brought upon you calamities which never before in your humble, solitary life you had experienced. This tortures and exhausts me more than I can tell to think of.","Your latest actions and letters have frightened, shocked and amazed me; however, the things Fedora has told me have explained everything. But why did you despair in this fashion and fall into the abyss into which you have fallen, Makar Alekseyevich? Your explanations have not satisfied me one little bit. Consider: was I not right when I insisted on accepting the advantageous post I was offered? What is more, my most recent adventure has frightened me in earnest. You say your love for me has compelled you to keep yourself in hiding from me. I was already able to see that I was greatly indebted to you when you kept assuring me that you were only spending your savings on me, savings you told me you had put by just in case. But now that I have discovered you had no such savings at all, that having found out about my straitened circumstances and having been touched by them you decided to spend your salary, which you had drawn in advance, and had even sold your clothes when I was ill – now, faced with the revelation of all this, I find myself in such an agonizingly difficult position that I still do not know how to construe all this, or what to think of it. Oh, Makar Alekseyevich! You should have rested content with the first of your good deeds towards me, which were prompted by compassion and familial affection, and not have squandered money on unnecessary things. You have betrayed our friendship, Makar Alekseyevich, because you have not been frank with me, and now, when I see that you spent the very last money you had on smart clothes, on sweets, on walks, on the theatre and on books – now I am paying dearly with remorse for my unforgivable frivolity (for I accepted all those things from you without troubling myself about you); and everything by means of which you wanted to give me enjoyment has now turned into bitterness for me, and has left in me nothing but a futile remorse. I have observed your despondency of late, and although I myself had a depressing sense that something was afoot, I never dreamed of this. How can it be? How could you let yourself sink to this depth of despondency, Makar Alekseyevich? What will people think of you, what will people say about you now, all those who know you? You, whom I and everyone else respected for your kindheartedness, your modesty and wisdom – you have fallen prey to a repulsive vice which no one has ever noticed in you before. What do you think I felt when Fedora told me you had been found drunk in the street and had been taken back to your lodgings by the police? I was paralysed with amazement, even though I had been expecting something untoward, as you had been missing for four days. Have you thought, Makar Alekseyevich, of what your superiors will say when they discover the true reason for your absence? You say that everyone is laughing at you; that everyone has found out about our friendship and that your neighbours are making sarcastic remarks about me. Please do not pay any attention to this, Makar Alekseyevich, and, for the love of God, take a hold of yourself. I am also frightened by this encounter you had with those officers; I have heard vague rumours about it. Please will you explain to me what that is all about? You say in your letter that you were afraid to be open with me, that you were afraid that if you told me about it you would lose my friendship, that you were in despair about what to do in order to help me in my illness, that you sold everything in order to support me and keep me from going into hospital, that you got yourself into debt to the very limit of your credit, and that every day you have unpleasant scenes with your landlady – but I must tell you that, in doing so, you have chosen the wrong course of action. Now, however, I have learned all. You were too ashamed to make me realize that I was the cause of your unhappy position, yet now, by your behaviour, you have succeeded in bringing me twice as much woe. All this has shocked me, Makar Alekseyevich. Oh, my friend! Unhappiness is an infectious disease. Poor and unhappy people ought to steer clear of one another, so as not to catch a greater degree of infection. I have brought you unhappiness such as you never experienced earlier in the modest and isolated existence you have led. All this is tormenting me and making me waste away with grief.","Your latest doings and letters have frightened, shocked, and amazed me, and what Fedora tells me has explained it all. But what reason had you to be so desperate and to sink to such a depth as you have sunk to, Makar Alexyevitch? Your explanation has not satisfied me at all. Isn’t it clear that I was right in trying to insist on taking the situation that was offered me? Besides, my last adventure has thoroughly frightened me. You say that it’s your love for me that makes you keep in hiding from me. I saw that I was deeply indebted to you while you persuaded me that you were only spending your savings on me, which you said you had lying by in the bank in case of need. Now, when I learn that you had no such money at all, but, hearing by chance of my straitened position, and touched by it, you actually spent your salary, getting it in advance, and even sold your clothes when I was ill—now that I have discovered all this I am put in such an agonising position that I still don’t know how to take it, and what to think about it. Oh, Makar Alexyevitch! You ought to have confined yourself to that first kind help inspired by sympathy and the feeling of kinship and not have wasted money afterwards on luxuries. You have been false to our friendship, Makar Alexyevitch, for you weren’t open with me. And now, when I see that you were spending your last penny on finery, on sweetmeats, on excursions, on the theatre and on books—now I am paying dearly for all that in regret for my frivolity (for I took it all from you without troubling myself about you); and everything with which you tried to give me pleasure is now turned to grief for me, and has left nothing but useless regret. I have noticed your depression of late, and, although I was nervously apprehensive of some trouble, what has happened never entered my head. What! Could you lose heart so completely, Makar Alexyevitch! Why, what am I to think of you now, what will everyone who knows you say of you now? You, whom I always respected for your good heart, your discretion, and your good sense. You have suddenly given way to such a revolting vice, of which one saw no sign in you before. What were my feelings when Fedora told me you were found in the street in a state of inebriety, and were brought home to your lodgings by the police! I was petrified with amazement, though I did expect something extraordinary, as there had been no sign of you for four days. Have you thought, Makar Alexyevitch, what your chiefs at the office will say when they learn the true cause of your absence? You say that everyone laughs at you, that they all know of our friendship, and that your neighbours speak of me in their jokes, too. Don’t pay any attention to that, Makar Alexyevitch, and for goodness’ sake, calm yourself. I am alarmed about your affair with those officers, too; I have heard a vague account of it. Do explain what it all means. You write that you were afraid to tell me, that you were afraid to lose my affection by your confession, that you were in despair, not knowing how to help me in my illness, that you sold everything to keep me and prevent my going to hospital, that you got into debt as far as you possibly could, and have unpleasant scenes every day with your landlady—but you made a mistake in concealing all this from me. Now I know it all, however. You were reluctant to make me realise that I was the cause of your unhappy position, and now you have caused me twice as much grief by your behaviour. All this has shocked me, Makar Alexyevitch. Oh, my dear friend! misfortune is an infectious disease, the poor and unfortunate ought to avoid one another, for fear of making each other worse. I have brought you trouble such as you knew nothing of in your old humble and solitary existence. All this is distressing and killing me."
"Спешу вам сообщить, жизнёночек вы мой, что у меня надежды родились кое-какие. Да позвольте, дочечка вы моя, – пишете, ангельчик, чтоб мне займов не делать? Голубчик вы мой, невозможно без них; уж и мне-то худо, да и с вами-то, чего доброго, что-нибудь вдруг да не так! ведь вы слабенькие; так вот я к тому и пишу, что занять-то непременно нужно. Ну, так я и продолжаю.","I hasten to inform you, you are my little life, that some hopes were born in me. Excuse me, my daughter, you write, angel, so that I don’t make loans? You are my dear, it is impossible without them; it’s bad for me, and it’s with you, what good, something suddenly, but not right! because you are weak; and so I am writing to that, that it is absolutely necessary to take something. Well, so I continue.","Oh light of my life, that my hopes are rising again. But, little daughter of mine—do you really mean it when you say that I am to indulge in no more borrowings? Why, I could not do without them. Things would go badly with us both if I did so. You are ailing. Consequently, I tell you roundly that I MUST borrow, and that I must continue to do so.","I hasten to inform you, little light of my life, that I have begun to entertain hopes of a certain nature. But, daughter mine – you write, my little angel, that I am not to take any loans? My little dove, I cannot manage without them; after all, I am unwell, and what if things were suddenly to go wrong for you, as for all I know they might? I mean, you are not exactly strong; so that is why I wrote that I must absolutely borrow some money. Well, then, I shall continue.","I hasten to tell you, my little life, I have fresh hopes of something. But excuse me, my little daughter, you write, my angel, that I am not to borrow money. My darling, it is impossible to avoid it; here I am in a bad way, and what if anything were suddenly amiss with you! You are frail, you know; so that’s why I say we must borrow. Well, so I will continue."
"Федора говорит, что если я захочу, то некоторые люди с удовольствием примут участие в моем положении и выхлопочут мне очень хорошее место в один дом, в гувернантки. Как вы думаете, друг мой, – идти или нет? Конечно, я вам тогда не буду в тягость, да и место, кажется, выгодное; но, с другой стороны, как-то жутко идти в незнакомый дом. Они какие-то помещики. Станут обо мне узнавать, начнут расспрашивать, любопытствовать – ну что я скажу тогда? К тому же я такая нелюдимка, дикарка; люблю пообжиться в привычном угле надолго. Как-то лучше там, где привыкнешь: хоть и с горем пополам живешь, а все-таки лучше. К тому же на выезд; да еще бог знает, какая должность будет; может быть, просто детей нянчить заставят. Да и люди-то такие: меняют уж третью гувернантку в два года. Посоветуйте же мне, Макар Алексеевич, ради бога, идти или нет? Да что вы никогда сами не зайдете ко мне? изредка только глаза покажете. Почти только по воскресеньям у обедни и видимся. Экой же вы нелюдим какой! Вы точно, как я! А ведь я вам почти родная. Не любите вы меня, Макар Алексеевич, а мне иногда одной очень грустно бывает. Иной раз, особенно в сумерки, сидишь себе одна-одинешенька. Федора уйдет куда-нибудь. Сидишь, думаешь-думаешь, – вспоминаешь все старое, и радостное, и грустное, – все идет перед глазами, все мелькает, как из тумана. Знакомые лица являются (я почти наяву начинаю видеть), – матушку вижу чаще всего… А какие бывают сны у меня! Я чувствую, что здоровье мое расстроено; я так слаба; вот и сегодня, когда вставала утром с постели, мне дурно сделалось; сверх того, у меня такой дурной кашель! Я чувствую, я знаю, что скоро умру. Кто-то меня похоронит? Кто-то за гробом моим пойдет? Кто-то обо мне пожалеет?.. И вот придется, может быть, умереть в чужом месте, в чужом доме, в чужом угле!.. Боже мой, как грустно жить, Макар Алексеевич! Что вы меня, друг мой, все конфетами кормите? Я право, не знаю, откудова вы денег столько берете? Ах, друг мой, берегите деньги, ради бога, берегите их. Федора продает ковер, который я вышила; дают пятьдесят рублей ассигнациями. Это очень хорошо: я думала, меньше будет. Я Федоре дам три целковых да себе сошью платьице, так, простенькое, потеплее. Вам жилетку сделаю, сама сделаю и материи хорошей выберу.","Fedora says that if I want, some people will be happy to take part in my position and get me a very good place in one house, as a governess. What do you think, my friend, should I go or not? Of course, then I won’t be a burden to you, and the place seems to be advantageous; but, on the other hand, it is somehow creepy to go to an unfamiliar house. They are some landowners. They will start to learn about me, they will start asking questions, curiosity - well, what can I say then? Besides, I'm such an unsociable, savage; I like to settle down in a familiar corner for a long time. It’s somehow better where you get used to it: although you live in half with grief, it’s still better. In addition to the exit; and besides, God knows what position there will be; maybe they'll just make the kids babysit. Yes, and people are like that: they change their third governess in two years. Advise me, Makar Alekseevich, for God's sake, should I go or not? Why don't you ever come to me? occasionally just show your eyes. We see each other almost only on Sundays at Mass. What kind of unsociable you are! You are exactly like me! And I'm almost like family to you. You don't love me, Makar Alekseevich, but sometimes I feel very sad alone. Sometimes, especially at dusk, you sit alone all alone. Fedora will go somewhere. You sit, think, think, - you remember everything old, and joyful, and sad, - everything goes before your eyes, everything flashes, as if from a fog. Familiar faces appear (I almost begin to see in reality), - I see my mother most often ... And what dreams I have! I feel that my health is upset; I'm so weak so today, when I got out of bed in the morning, I felt ill; besides, I have such a bad cough! I feel, I know that I will die soon. Will someone bury me? Someone will follow my coffin? Will someone pity me?.. And now, perhaps, I will have to die in a strange place, in a strange house, in a strange corner!.. My God, how sad it is to live, Makar Alekseevich! Why are you feeding me, my friend, all the sweets? I really don't know, where do you get so much money from? Ah, my friend, save your money, for God's sake, save it. Fedora is selling a carpet that I have embroidered; give fifty rubles in banknotes. This is very good: I thought it would be less. I'll give Fedora three roubles, and I'll sew a dress for myself, so simple, warmer. I'll make you a vest, I'll make it myself and choose good materials.","Thedora tells me that, should I wish, there are some people who will be glad to help me by obtaining me an excellent post as governess in a certain house. What think you, my friend? Shall I go or not? Of course, I should then cease to be a burden to you, and the post appears to be a comfortable one. On the other hand, the idea of entering a strange house appals me. The people in it are landed gentry, and they will begin to ask me questions, and to busy themselves about me. What answers shall I then return? You see, I am now so unused to society— so shy! I like to live in a corner to which I have long grown used. Yes, the place with which one is familiar is always the best. Even if for companion one has but sorrow, that place will still be the best.... God alone knows what duties the post will entail. Perhaps I shall merely be required to act as nursemaid; and in any case, I hear that the governess there has been changed three times in two years. For God’s sake, Makar Alexievitch, advise me whether to go or not. Why do you never come near me now? Do let my eyes have an occasional sight of you. Mass on Sundays is almost the only time when we see one another. How retiring you have become! So also have I, even though, in a way, I am your kinswoman. You must have ceased to love me, Makar Alexievitch. I spend many a weary hour because of it. Sometimes, when dusk is falling, I find myself lonely— oh, so lonely! Thedora has gone out somewhere, and I sit here and think, and think, and think. I remember all the past, its joys and its sorrows. It passes before my eyes in detail, it glimmers at me as out of a mist; and as it does so, well-known faces appear, which seem actually to be present with me in this room! Most frequently of all, I see my mother. Ah, the dreams that come to me! I feel that my health is breaking, so weak am I. When this morning I arose, sickness took me until I vomited and vomited. Yes, I feel, I know, that death is approaching. Who will bury me when it has come? Who will visit my tomb? Who will sorrow for me? And now it is in a strange place, in the house of a stranger, that I may have to die! Yes, in a corner which I do not know!... My God, how sad a thing is life!... Why do you send me comfits to eat? Whence do you get the money to buy them? Ah, for God’s sake keep the money, keep the money. Thedora has sold a carpet which I have made. She got fifty roubles for it, which is very good—I had expected less. Of the fifty roubles I shall give Thedora three, and with the remainder make myself a plain, warm dress. Also, I am going to make you a waistcoat—to make it myself, and out of good material.","Fedora says that if I am willing, there are certain people who will be pleased to take an active interest in my position, and will obtain for me a very good post as governess in a certain house. What do you think, my friend – should I accept or not? Of course, I should not then be a burden on you any longer, and the post does seem to be an advantageous one; on the other hand, though, I do not feel good about entering a house of people whom I do not know. They are some kind of country landowners. If they start trying to find out about me, asking me questions, probing me – what shall I say? Then again, I’m so shy and unsociable; I like to go on living for a long time in the same familiar corner. It’s somehow better living in the place one’s used to: even though one’s miserable half the time, it’s still better. The place is in the country, what’s more; and heaven only knows what sort of duties I will have; perhaps they’ll just make me look after the children. And they’re such people, too: they’ve had three governesses in two years. For the love of God, tell me what you think, Makar Alekseyevich, should I accept or not? And why do you never visit me? It’s so seldom that you show your face. We hardly ever see each other except in church on Sundays. What an unsociable fellow you are! You’re just like I am. I’m nearly a relation of yours, you know. You don’t love me, Makar Alekseyevich, and I sometimes get very sad on my own. At times, especially when it’s getting dark, I find myself sitting alone as alone can be. Fedora will have gone off somewhere. I sit and think andthink – I remember all the old times, the joyful ones and the sad ones, and they all pass before my eyes, flickering as through a mist. Familiar faces appear (I almost begin to see them for real), and it is Mother whom I see most frequently… And what dreams I have! I have a feeling that my health is not as good as it should be; I am so weak; this morning, for example, when I got out of bed, I started to feel peculiar; on top of that I have such a bad cough! I feel – indeed I know – that I shall die soon. Will anyone give me a funeral? Will anyone walk behind my coffin? Will anyone miss me?… And now, perhaps, I shall have to the in a strange place, in an alien corner of someone else’s house… O my God, how sad life is, Makar Alekseyevich! Why do you keep stuffing me with sweets, my friend? I really don’t know where you get all the money from. Oh, my friend, look after your money, for God’s sake look after it. Fedora is selling the rug I have made; she can get fifty paper rubles for it. That’s very good ; I had thought it would be less. I shall give Fedora three silver rubles and make myself a new dress – a simple, warm one. I shall make you a waistcoat, I shall make it myself, and shall choose a good material for it.","Fedora tells me that, if I like, certain people will be pleased to interest themselves in my position, and will get me a very good position as a governess in a family. What do you think about it, my friend—shall I go, or shall I not? Of course I should not then be a burden upon you, and the situation seems a good one; but, on the other hand, I feel somehow frightened at going into a strange house. They are people with an estate in the country. When they want to know all about me, when they begin asking questions, making inquiries—why, what should I say then?—besides , I am so shy and unsociable, I like to go on living in the corner I am used to. It’s better somehow where one is used to being; even though one spends half one’s time grieving, still it is better. Besides, it means leaving Petersburg; and God knows what my duties will be, either; perhaps they will simply make me look after the children, like a nurse. And they are such queer people, too; they’ve had three governesses already in two years. Do advise me, Makar Alexyevitch, whether to go or not. And why do you never come and see me? You hardly ever show your face, we scarcely ever meet except on Sundays at mass. What an unsociable person you are! You are as bad as I am! And you know I am almost a relation. You don’t love me, Makar Alexyevitch, and I am sometimes very sad all alone. Sometimes, especially when it is getting dark, one sits all alone. Fedora goes off somewhere, one sits and sits and thinks—one remembers all the past, joyful and sad alike —it all passes before one’s eyes, it all rises up as though out of a mist. Familiar faces appear (I am almost beginning to see them in reality)—I see mother most often of all ... And what dreams I have! I feel that I am not at all well, I am so weak; to-day, for instance, when I got out of bed this morning, I turned giddy; and I have such a horrid cough, too! I feel, I know, that I shall soon die. Who will bury me? Who will follow my coffin! Who will grieve for me! ... And perhaps I may have to die in a strange place, in a strange house! ... My goodness! how sad life is, Makar Alexyevitch. Why do you keep feeding me on sweetmeats? I really don’t know where you get so much money from? Ah, my friend, take care of your money, for God’s sake, take care of it. Fedora is selling the cloth rug I have embroidered; she is getting fifty paper roubles for it. That’s very good , I thought it would be less. I shall give Fedora three silver roubles, and shall get a new dress for myself, a plain one but warm. I shall make you a waistcoat , I shall make it myself, and I shall choose a good material."
"Уж хоть вы-то бы не отчаивались! И так горя довольно. Посылаю вам тридцать копеек серебром; больше никак не могу. Купите себе там, что вам более нужно, чтобы хоть до завтра прожить как-нибудь. У нас у самих почти ничего не осталось, а завтра уж и не знаю, что будет. Грустно, Макар Алексеевич! Впрочем, не грустите; не удалось, так что ж делать! Федора говорит, что еще не беда, что можно до времени и на этой квартире остаться, что если бы и переехали, так все бы немного выгадали, и что если захотят, так везде нас найдут. Да только все как-то нехорошо здесь оставаться теперь. Если бы не грустно было, я бы вам кое-что написала.","At least you wouldn't despair! And so grief enough. I am sending you thirty kopecks in silver; I can't do it anymore. Buy yourself there what you need more so that you can live somehow until tomorrow. We ourselves have almost nothing left, and tomorrow I don’t know what will happen. It's sad, Makar Alekseevich! However, do not be sad; failed, so what to do! Fedora says that it doesn’t matter yet, that we can stay in this apartment until the time comes, that even if we moved, everyone would benefit a little, and that if they want, they will find us everywhere. But everything is somehow not good to stay here now. If it were not sad, I would write something to you.","ALEXIEVITCH,—You must not despair. Away with melancholy! I am sending you thirty kopecks in silver, and regret that I cannot send you more. Buy yourself what you most need until tomorrow. I myself have almost nothing left, and what I am going to do I know not. Is it not dreadful, Makar Alexievitch? Yet do not be downcast—it is no good being that. Thedora declares that it would not be a bad thing if we were to remain in this tenement, since if we left it suspicions would arise, and our enemies might take it into their heads to look for us. On the other hand, I do not think it would be well for us to remain here. If I were feeling less sad I would tell you my reason.","Please don’t give in to despair! There is enough trouble already as it is. I am sending you thirty copecks in silver; more than that I cannot manage. Buy yourself the things you need most, so that at least you can survive until tomorrow. We ourselves have practically nothing left, and I do not know what will happen tomorrow. It is so sad, Makar Alekseyevich! But don’t you be sad; if you haven’t succeeded, there is nothing to be done about it. Fedora says that it is not a complete disaster, that we can stay on in this apartment for a while yet, that even if we moved we wouldn’t gain that much by it, and that if they really put their minds to it they can find us wherever we are. It is just that I don’t feel very good about staying on here now. If I didn’t feel so sad I would write to you about a few things.","You really mustn’t give way to despair. There’s trouble enough without that. I send you thirty kopecks in silver, I cannot manage more. Buy yourself what you need most, so as to get along somehow, until tomorrow. We have scarcely anything left ourselves, and I don’t know what will happen to-morrow. It’s sad, Makar Alexyevitch! Don’t be sad, though, if you’ve not succeeded, there’s no help for it. Fedora says that there is no harm done so far, that we can stay for the time in this lodging, that if we did move we shouldn’t gain much by it, and that they can find us anywhere if they want to. Though I don’t feel comfortable at staying here now. If it were not so sad I would have written you an account of something."

"Старик Покровский целую ночь провел в коридоре, у самой двери в комнату сына; тут ему постлали какую-то рогожку. Он поминутно входил в комнату; на него страшно было смотреть. Он был так убит горем, что казался совершенно бесчувственным и бессмысленным. Голова его тряслась от страха. Он сам весь дрожал, и все что-то шептал про себя, о чем-то рассуждал сам с собою. Мне казалось, что он с ума сойдет с горя.","Old Pokrovsky spent the whole night in the corridor, at the very door to his son's room; here they put some kind of matting on him. He entered the room every minute; it was terrible to look at him. He was so heartbroken that he seemed completely insensitive and senseless. His head was shaking with fear. He himself was trembling all over, and kept whispering something to himself, talking about something to himself. I thought he was going crazy with grief.","That night the elder Pokrovski spent in the corridor, at the door of his son’s room. Though given a mattress to lie upon, he spent his time in running in and out of the apartment. So broken with grief was he that he presented a dreadful spectacle, and appeared to have lost both perception and feeling. His head trembled with agony, and his body quivered from head to foot as at times he murmured to himself something which he appeared to be debating. Every moment I expected to see him go out of his mind.","Old man Pokrovsky spent the whole night out in the passage, right by the door to his son’s room; some bast-matting had been spread on the floor for him there. Every minute or so he would enter the room; it was terrible to see him. So crushed by grief was he that he seemed completely inane and insensate. His head shook with fear. He was quivering all over, and kept whispering something to himself, carrying on some private argument with himself. I thought he might go crazy with grief.","Old Pokrovsky spent the whole night in the passage at the door of his son’s room; a rug of some sort was put down there for him. He kept coming into the room, it was dreadful to look at him. He was so crushed by sorrow that he seemed utterly senseless and without feeling. His head was shaking with terror. He was trembling all over and kept whispering something, talking about something to himself. It seemed to me he was going out of his mind."
"Похоронами распорядилась сама Анна Федоровна. Купили гроб простой-простой и наняли ломового извозчика. В обеспечение издержек Анна Федоровна захватила все книги и все вещи покойного. Старик с ней спорил, шумел, отнял у ней книг, сколько мог, набил ими все свои карманы, наложил их в шляпу, куда мог, носился с ними все три дня и даже не расстался с ними и тогда, когда нужно было идти в церковь. Все эти дни он был как беспамятный, как одурелый и с какою-то странною заботливостию все хлопотал около гроба: то оправлял венчик на покойнике, то зажигал и снимал свечи. Видно было, что мысли его ни на чем не могли остановиться порядком. Ни матушка, ни Анна Федоровна не были в церкви на отпевании. Матушка была больна, а Анна Федоровна совсем было уж собралась, да поссорилась со стариком Покровским и осталась. Была только одна я да старик. Во время службы на меня напал какой-то страх – словно предчувствие будущего. Я едва могла выстоять в церкви. Наконец гроб закрыли, заколотили, поставили на телегу и повезли. Я проводила его только до конца улицы. Извозчик поехал рысью. Старик бежал за ним и громко плакал; плач его дрожал и прерывался от бега. Бедный потерял свою шляпу и не остановился поднять ее. Голова его мокла от дождя; поднимался ветер; изморозь секла и колола лицо. Старик, кажется, не чувствовал непогоды и с плачем перебегал с одной стороны телеги на другую. Полы его ветхого сюртука развевались по ветру, как крылья. Из всех карманов торчали книги; в руках его была какая-то огромная книга, за которую он крепко держался. Прохожие снимали шапки и крестились. Иные останавливались и дивились на бедного старика. Книги поминутно падали у него из карманов в грязь. Его останавливали, показывали ему на потерю; он поднимал и опять пускался вдогонку за гробом. На углу улицы увязалась с ним вместе провожать гроб какая-то нищая старуха. Телега поворотила наконец за угол и скрылась от глаз моих. Я пошла домой. Я бросилась в страшной тоске на грудь матушки. Я сжимала ее крепко-крепко в руках своих, целовала ее и навзрыд плакала, боязливо прижимаясь к ней, как бы стараясь удержать в своих объятиях последнего друга моего и не отдавать его смерти… Но смерть уже стояла над бедной матушкой!..","Anna Feodorovna herself ordered the funeral. We bought a simple, simple coffin and hired a draft cab. To secure the costs, Anna Fedorovna seized all the books and all the belongings of the deceased. The old man argued with her, made a noise, took as many books from her as he could, stuffed all his pockets with them, put them in his hat wherever he could, ran around with them all three days and did not even part with them even when he had to go to church. . All these days he was as if unconscious, as if stupefied, and with a kind of strange solicitude he kept bustling about near the coffin: now adjusting the whisk on the deceased, then lighting and removing candles. It was evident that his thoughts could not stop at anything in order. Neither matushka nor Anna Fedorovna were in the church for the funeral service. Matushka was ill, but Anna Fyodorovna was about to get ready, but she quarreled with old Pokrovsky and stayed behind. There was only one me and the old man. During the service, some kind of fear attacked me - like a premonition of the future. I could barely stand in church. Finally, the coffin was closed, boarded up, put on a cart and taken away. I walked him only to the end of the street. The driver went at a trot. The old man ran after him and wept loudly; his crying trembled and was interrupted by running. The poor man lost his hat and did not stop to pick it up. His head was wet from the rain; the wind rose; frost cut and pricked the face. The old man, it seems, did not feel the weather, and weeping ran from one side of the cart to the other. The flaps of his shabby frock coat fluttered in the wind like wings. Books stuck out of every pocket; in his hands was some kind of huge book, to which he held tightly. Passers-by took off their hats and crossed themselves. Others stopped and marveled at the poor old man. Books kept falling out of his pockets into the dirt. They stopped him, showed him the loss; he picked it up and again set off in pursuit of the coffin. At the corner of the street, a beggar old woman tagged along with him to see off the coffin. The cart finally turned the corner and disappeared from my eyes. I'v gone home. I threw myself in terrible anguish on my mother's chest. I squeezed her tightly in my arms, kissed her and wept bitterly, timidly clinging to her, as if trying to keep my last friend in my arms and not give him to death ... But death was already standing over poor mother! ..","The funeral was arranged for by Anna Thedorovna. A plain coffin was bought, and a broken-down hearse hired; while, as security for this outlay, she seized the dead man’s books and other articles. Nevertheless, the old man disputed the books with her, and, raising an uproar, carried off as many of them as he could—stuffing his pockets full, and even filling his hat. Indeed, he spent the next three days with them thus, and refused to let them leave his sight even when it was time for him to go to church. Throughout he acted like a man bereft of sense and memory. With quaint assiduity he busied himself about the bier—now straightening the candlestick on the dead man’s breast, now snuffing and lighting the other candles. Clearly his thoughts were powerless to remain long fixed on any subject. Neither my mother nor Anna Thedorovna were present at the requiem, for the former was ill and the latter was at loggerheads with the old man. Only myself and the father were there. During the service a sort of panic, a sort of premonition of the future, came over me, and I could hardly hold myself upright. At length the coffin had received its burden and was screwed down; after which the bearers placed it upon a bier, and set out. I accompanied the cortège only to the end of the street. Here the driver broke into a trot, and the old man started to run behind the hearse—sobbing loudly, but with the motion of his running ever and anon causing the sobs to quaver and become broken off. Next he lost his hat, the poor old fellow, yet would not stop to pick it up, even though the rain was beating upon his head, and a wind was rising and the sleet kept stinging and lashing his face. It seemed as though he were impervious to the cruel elements as he ran from one side of the hearse to the other—the skirts of his old greatcoat flapping about him like a pair of wings. From every pocket of the garment protruded books, while in his hand he carried a specially large volume, which he hugged closely to his breast. The passers-by uncovered their heads and crossed themselves as the cortège passed, and some of them, having done so, remained staring in amazement at the poor old man. Every now and then a book would slip from one of his pockets and fall into the mud; whereupon somebody, stopping him, would direct his attention to his loss, and he would stop, pick up the book, and again set off in pursuit of the hearse. At the corner of the street he was joined by a ragged old woman; until at length the hearse turned a corner, and became hidden from my eyes. Then I went home, and threw myself, in a transport of grief, upon my mother’s breast—clasping her in my arms, kissing her amid a storm of sobs and tears, and clinging to her form as though in my embraces I were holding my last friend on earth, that I might preserve her from death. Yet already death was standing over her....","The arrangements for the funeral were made personally by Anna Fyodorovna. A coffin of the very plainest kind was bought, and a drayman hired. In order to meet the expenses, Anna Fyodorovna laid claim to all the dead man’s books and personal effects. The old man argued with her, kicked up a row, took back from her as many books as he could, stuffed all his pockets with them, put them into his hat, or wherever else he could think of, went around with them for a whole three days and would not even part with them when he had to go to church. For all those days he was like someone unconscious, like someone who has been stupefied, and kept fussing near the coffin with a strange solicitude: now he would straighten the wreath on the corpse, now he would light or snuff the candles. It was evident that his thoughts could not rest on anything in an ordered manner. Neither Mother nor Anna Fyodorovna were present in the church during the funeral service. Mother was sick, and Anna Fyodorovna, though she had got herself all ready to go, had quarrelled with old man Pokrovsky and had remained at home. The only people present were the old man and myself. During the service I was attacked by a sense of terror – a kind of premonition of the future. I could barely manage to stay on my feet in church. Finally the coffin was shut, nailed up, placed in the drayman’s cart and hauled away. I accompanied it only to the end of the street. The drayman was making his horse go at a trot. The old man ran after him, weeping loudly, his wailing shaken and punctuated by his running. The poor fellow had lost his hat and had not stopped to pick it up. His hair was sodden with rain; the wind was getting up; the sleet was lashing and stinging his face. The old man seemed insensible to the foul weather, and ran wailing from one side of the cart to the other. The skirts of his threadbare coat fluttered in the wind like wings. Books peeped from every one of his pockets; in his arms he was carrying an enormous tome, to which he clung tightly. Passers-by would remove their hats and cross themselves. Some people stopped and stared in wonder at the poor old man. Every so often books would fall out of his pockets and land in the mud. People would stop and point to them; he would pick them up and then scramble off in pursuit of the coffin once more. At the corner of the street an old beggar woman tagged along after him, keeping him company. At last the cart turned the corner and disappeared from view. I went home. When I got there, I threw myself on Mother’s breast in a terrible state of anguish. I pressed her in my arms as close as I possibly could, kissed her and sobbed violently, anxiously nestling against her as though in my embraces seeking to retain my last friend, and not surrender her to death. But death was already overshadowing poor Mother…","Anna Fyodorovna herself made the arrangements for the funeral. A coffin of the cheapest kind was bought and a carter was hired. To defray these expenses Anna Fyodorovna seized all Pokrovsky’s books and other belongings. The old man argued with her, made a noise, took away all the books he could from her, stuffed his pockets full of them, put them in his hat, wherever he could, went about with them all those three days, and did not part with them even when he had to go to church. During those three days he seemed as it were, stupefied, as though he did not know what he was doing, and he kept fussing about the coffin with a strange solicitude; at one moment he set straight the wreath on his dead son and at the next he lighted and took away candles. It was evident that his thoughts could not rest on anything. Neither mother nor Anna Fyodorovna was at the funeral service at the church. Mother was ill; Anna Fyodorovna had got ready to go, but she quarrelled with old Pokrovsky and stayed behind. I went alone with the old man. During the service a terror came upon me—as though a foreboding of the future. I could scarcely stand up in church. At last the coffin was closed, nailed up, put in the cart and taken away. I followed it only to the end of the street. The man drove at a trot. The old man ran after him, weeping loudly, his lamentations quivering and broken by his haste. The poor old man lost his hat and did not stop to pick it up. His head was drenched by the rain and the wind was rising; the sleet lashed and stung his face.

Some stopped and stood gazing in wonder at the poor old man. The books kept falling out of his pockets into the mud.

At the corner of the street an old beggar woman joined him to follow the coffin with him. The cart turned the corner at last and disappeared from my sight. I went home. I threw myself on mother’s bosom in terrible distress. I pressed her tightly in my arms, I kissed her and burst into floods of tears, huddling up to her fearfully as though trying to keep in my arms my last friend and not to give her up to death ... but death was already hovering over poor mother...."

"Признательно вам сказать, родная моя, начал я вам описывать это все частию, чтоб сердце отвести, а более для того, чтоб вам образец хорошего слогу моих сочинений показать. Потому что вы, верно, сами сознаетесь, маточка, что у меня с недавнего времени слог формируется. Но теперь на меня такая тоска нашла, что я сам моим мыслям до глубины души стал сочувствовать, и хотя я сам знаю, маточка, что этим сочувствием не возьмешь, но все-таки некоторым образом справедливость воздашь себе. И подлинно, родная моя, часто самого себя безо всякой причины уничтожаешь, в грош не ставишь и ниже щепки какой-нибудь сортируешь. А если сравнением выразиться, так это, может быть, оттого происходит, что я сам запуган и загнан, как хоть бы и этот бедненький мальчик, что милостыни у меня просил. Теперь я вам, примерно, иносказательно буду говорить, маточка; вот послушайте-ка меня: случается мне, моя родная, рано утром, на службу спеша, заглядеться на город, как он там пробуждается, встает, дымится, кипит, гремит, – тут иногда так перед таким зрелищем умалишься, что как будто бы щелчок какой получил от кого-нибудь по любопытному носу, да и поплетешься тише воды ниже травы своею дорогою и рукой махнешь! Теперь же разглядите-ка, что в этих черных, закоптелых, больших, капитальных домах делается, вникните в это, и тогда сами рассудите, справедливо ли было без толку сортировать себя и в недостойное смущение входить. Заметьте, Варенька, что я иносказательно говорю, не в прямом смысле. Ну, посмотрим, что там такое в этих домах? Там в каком-нибудь дымном углу, в конуре сырой какой-нибудь, которая, по нужде, за квартиру считается, мастеровой какой-нибудь от сна пробудился; а во сне-то ему, примерно говоря, всю ночь сапоги снились, что вчера он подрезал нечаянно, как будто именно такая дрянь и должна человеку сниться! Ну да ведь он мастеровой, он сапожник: ему простительно все об одном предмете своем думать. У него там дети пищат и жена голодная; и не одни сапожники встают иногда так, родная моя. Это бы и ничего, и писать бы об этом не стоило, но вот какое выходит тут обстоятельство, маточка: тут же, в этом же доме, этажом выше или ниже, в позлащенных палатах, и богатейшему лицу все те же сапоги, может быть, ночью снились, то есть на другой манер сапоги, фасона другого, но все-таки сапоги; ибо в смысле-то, здесь мною подразумеваемом, маточка, все мы, родная моя, выходим немного сапожники. И это бы все ничего, но только то дурно, что нет никого подле этого богатейшего лица, нет человека, который бы шепнул ему на ухо, что «полно, дескать, о таком думать, о себе одном думать, для себя одного жить; ты, дескать, не сапожник, у тебя дети здоровы и жена есть не просит; оглянись кругом, не увидишь ли для забот своих предмета более благородного, чем свои сапоги!» Вот что хотел я сказать вам иносказательно, Варенька. Это, может быть, слишком вольная мысль, родная моя, но эта мысль иногда бывает, иногда приходит и тогда поневоле из сердца горячим словом выбивается. И потому не от чего было в грош себя оценять, испугавшись одного шума и грома! Заключу же тем, маточка, что вы, может быть, подумаете, что я вам клевету говорю, или что это так, хандра на меня нашла, или что я это из книжки какой выписал? Нет, маточка, вы разуверьтесь, – не то: клеветою гнушаюсь, хандра не находила и ни из какой книжки ничего не выписывал – вот что!","I am grateful to tell you, my dear, I began to describe all this to you in part, in order to take my heart away, and more so in order to show you an example of the good style of my writings. Because you, right, yourself confess, mother, that my syllable has been forming recently. But now such anguish has come over me that I myself began to sympathize with my thoughts to the depths of my soul, and although I myself know, mother, that this sympathy will not take, you will still do justice to yourself in some way. And truly, my dear, you often destroy yourself for no reason, you don’t put a penny and sort some kind of chip below. And if we put it in terms of comparison, it may be because I myself am intimidated and driven away, just like this poor boy who asked for alms from me. Now I will speak to you, roughly, allegorically, mother; Now listen to me: it happens to me, my dear, early in the morning, hurrying to work, to look at the city, how it wakes up there, gets up, smokes, boils, rattles - here sometimes you become so small in front of such a spectacle that it’s like a click who received from someone a curious nose, and you will trudge more quietly than water below the grass on your way and wave your hand! Now take a look at what is going on in these black, smoky, large, solid houses, delve into it, and then judge for yourself whether it was fair to sort yourself out to no purpose and enter into unworthy embarrassment. Note, Varenka, that I speak allegorically, not in the literal sense. Well, let's see what's in these houses? There, in some smoky corner, in some kind of damp kennel, which, out of need, is considered an apartment, some artisan woke up from sleep; and in a dream, roughly speaking, he dreamed all night of his boots that he accidentally cut yesterday, as if it was precisely such rubbish that a person should dream of! Why, he's a craftsman, he's a shoemaker: it's excusable for him to think about his own subject all the time. He has children squeaking there and his wife is hungry; and not only shoemakers sometimes get up like that, my dear. It would be nothing, and it would not be worth writing about, but here is the circumstance that comes out here, mother: right there, in the same house, on the floor above or below, in gilded chambers, and the richest face all the same boots, maybe at night they dreamed, that is, in a different manner, boots, of a different style, but still boots; for in the sense that I mean here, mother, we all, my dear, come out a little shoemakers. And that would be all right, but it’s only bad that there is no one near this richest person, there is no person who would whisper in his ear that “it’s enough, they say, to think about such things, think about yourself alone, live for yourself alone; you, they say, are not a shoemaker, your children are healthy and your wife does not ask for food; look around you, you will not see for your cares an object more noble than your boots! That's what I wanted to tell you allegorically, Varenka. This, perhaps, is a too free thought, my dear, but this thought sometimes happens, sometimes it comes, and then it is involuntarily knocked out of the heart with a hot word. And therefore, there was nothing to evaluate oneself for a penny, frightened by one noise and thunder! I’ll conclude by saying, mother, that you might think that I’m telling you slander, or that it’s so, the spleen has found me, or that I wrote it out of some book? No, mother, you will not be convinced - it’s not that: I abhor slander, I didn’t find melancholy and didn’t write anything out of any book - that’s what!","To tell you the truth, my darling, I have written the foregoing not merely to relieve my feelings, but, also, still more, to give you an example of the excellent style in which I can write. You yourself will recognise that my style was formed long ago, but of late such fits of despondency have seized upon me that my style has begun to correspond to my feelings; and though I know that such correspondence gains one little, it at least renders one a certain justice. For not unfrequently it happens that, for some reason or another, one feels abased, and inclined to value oneself at nothing, and to account oneself lower than a dishclout; but this merely arises from the fact that at the time one is feeling harassed and depressed, like the poor boy who today asked of me alms. Let me tell you an allegory, dearest, and do you hearken to it. Often, as I hasten to the office in the morning, I look around me at the city—I watch it awaking, getting out of bed, lighting its fires, cooking its breakfast, and becoming vocal; and at the sight, I begin to feel smaller, as though some one had dealt me a rap on my inquisitive nose. Yes, at such times I slink along with a sense of utter humiliation in my heart. For one would have but to see what is passing within those great, black, grimy houses of the capital, and to penetrate within their walls, for one at once to realise what good reason there is for self-depredation and heart-searching. Of course, you will note that I am speaking figuratively rather than literally. Let us look at what is passing within those houses. In some dingy corner, perhaps, in some damp kennel which is supposed to be a room, an artisan has just awakened from sleep. All night he has dreamt—IF such an insignificant fellow is capable of dreaming?—about the shoes which last night he mechanically cut out. He is a master-shoemaker, you see, and therefore able to think of nothing but his one subject of interest. Nearby are some squalling children and a hungry wife. Nor is he the only man that has to greet the day in this fashion. Indeed, the incident would be nothing—it would not be worth writing about, save for another circumstance. In that same house ANOTHER person—a person of great wealth—may also have been dreaming of shoes; but, of shoes of a very different pattern and fashion (in a manner of speaking, if you understand my metaphor, we are all of us shoemakers). This, again, would be nothing, were it not that the rich person has no one to whisper in his ear: “Why dost thou think of such things? Why dost thou think of thyself alone, and live only for thyself— thou who art not a shoemaker? THY children are not ailing. THY wife is not hungry. Look around thee. Can’st thou not find a subject more fitting for thy thoughts than thy shoes?” That is what I want to say to you in allegorical language, Barbara. Maybe it savours a little of free-thought, dearest; but, such ideas WILL keep arising in my mind and finding utterance in impetuous speech. Why, therefore, should one not value oneself at a groat as one listens in fear and trembling to the roar and turmoil of the city? Maybe you think that I am exaggerating things —that this is a mere whim of mine, or that I am quoting from a book? No, no, Barbara. You may rest assured that it is not so. Exaggeration I abhor, with whims I have nothing to do, and of quotation I am guiltless. I arrived home today in a melancholy mood.","To tell you the truth, my dear, I began describing all this to you partly in order to unburden my heart, but more particularly in order to provide you with an example of the good style of my literary compositions. Because I think you will probably agree, little mother, that my style has improved of late. But now I am visited by such sickness of heart that I have begun to feel my thoughts in the depths of my soul, and although I am aware, little mother, that this feeling will not get me anywhere , I none the less believe that I am in a certain sense doing myself justice. And really, my darling, I often take the wind out of my own sails for no reason at all, I consider myself not worth a pinch of salt, class myself among the lowest of the low. To use a comparison: perhaps this happens because, like that poor boy who begged me for alms, I myself am bullied and overworked. Now I shall express this to you by way of example and allegory, little mother; listen to this: sometimes, my darling, early in the morning when I am hurrying to work, I have occasion to take a glance at the city as it is waking up and getting out of bed, emitting its vapours, seething and rumbling – sometimes this spectacle makes one feel so small that it is though someone had given one a slap on one is inquisitive nose, and one trudges onwards with a shrug of one is shoulders, as quiet as a mouse. Now, just take a look at what is going on in those big, black, sooty buildings, investigate it thoroughly, and you yourself will be able to tell whether I had good reason to class myself as the lowest of the low and to be cast into an undignified state of confusion. Observe, Varenka, that I express myself allegorically, not in a direct sense. Well, let’s take a look: what is there in those buildings? There, in some smoky corner, in some dank bolthole which must out of necessity serve as a lodging, some artisan is waking from slumber; all night he has been dreaming, let us say, of the boots which the day before he inadvertenyly cut a hole in, as though anyone ought to spend a whole night dreaming about such rubbish! But he is an artisan, a cobbler: it is excusable for him to think about his specialty all the time. His children are clamouring and his wife is hungry; and it is not just cobblers who sometimes get out of bed in the morning feeling like that, little mother. That would be of no consequence, and would not be worth writing about; but you see, little mother, there is something else to be taken into account: right there, in the same building, on the storey above or below, in his gilded chambers, a very rich personage has been dreaming in the night about those very same boots – in a different aspect, of course, from a different point of view, but still about those boots; for in the sense I am here implying, little mother, we are all, my darling, to a certain extent cobblers. Even that would be of no consequence, except that it is bad that there should be no one at that very rich personage is side, no one who might whisper in his ear the words: ‘Come now, that is enough of thinking only about this subject, of thinking only about yourself, living only for yourself ; you’re not a cobbler, your children are healthy and your wife isn’t begging for food; take a look around you – can’t you find a more noble subject for your concern than your boots?’ That is what I wanted to say to you in this allegorical manner, Varenka. It is, my dear, possibly too radical a thought, but it is a thought that is sometimes there, that sometimes visits one and then emerges from one is heart in ardent words. And so there was no reason to consider oneself not worth a pinch of salt, and let oneself be frightened by all the noise and thunder! I will conclude, little mother, by supposing you may wonder if I am spouting slander, or have been overtaken by an attack of spleen, or have copied all this out of some book or other. No, little mother, you may dispose of any such illusions: I loathe slander , I haven’t had an attack of spleen, and I didn’t copy this out of any book – so there!","To make a confession, my own, I began to describe all this to you partly to relieve my heart but chiefly to give you an example of the fine style of my composition, for you have no doubt noticed yourself, my dear girl, that of late my style has been forming, but such a depression came over me that I began to pity my feelings to the depth of my soul, and though I know, my dear, that one gets no good by self-pity, yet one must do oneself justice in some way, and often, my own, for no reason whatever, one literally annihilates oneself, makes oneself of no account, and not worth a straw. And perhaps that is why it happens that I am panic-stricken and persecuted like that poor boy who asked me for alms. Now I will tell you, by way of instance and illustration, Varinka; listen: hurrying to the office early in the morning, my own , I sometimes look at the town, how it wakes, gets up, begins smoking, hurrying with life, resounding—sometimes you feel so small before such a sight that it is as though someone had given you a flip on your intrusive nose and you creep along your way noiseless as water, and humble as grass, and hold your peace! Now just look into it and see what is going on in those great, black, smutty buildings. Get to the bottom of that and then judge whether one was right to abuse oneself for no reason and to be reduced to undignified mortification. Note, Varinka, that I am speaking figuratively, not in a literal sense. But let us look what is going on in those houses. There, in some smoky corner, in some damp hole, which, through poverty, passes as a lodging, some workman wakes up from his sleep; and all night he has been dreaming of boots, for instance, which he had accidentally slit the day before, as though a man ought to dream of such nonsense! But he’s an artisan , he’s a shoemaker; it’s excusable for him to think of nothing but his own subject. His children are crying and his wife is hungry; and it’s not only shoemakers who get up in the morning like that, my own—that would not matter, and would not be worth writing about, but this is the point, Varinka: close by in the same house, in a storey higher or lower, a wealthy man in his gilded apartments dreams at night, it may be, of those same boots, that is, boots in a different manner, in a different sense, but still boots, for in the sense I am using the word, Varinka, everyone of us is a bit of a shoemaker, my darling; and that would not matter, only it’s a pity there is no one at that wealthy person’s side, no man who could whisper in his ear: “Come, give over thinking of such things, thinking of nothing but yourself, living for nothing but yourself; your children are healthy, your wife is not begging for food. Look about you, can’t you see some object more noble to worry about than your boots?” That’s what I wanted to say to you in a figurative way, Varinka. Perhaps it’s too free a thought, my own, but sometimes one has that thought, sometimes it comes to one and one cannot help its bursting out from one’s heart in warm language. And so it seems there was no reason to make oneself so cheap, and to be scared by mere noise and uproar. I will conclude by saying, Varinka, that perhaps you think what I am saying is unjust, or that I’m suffering from a fit of the spleen, or that I have copied this out of some book. No, my dear girl, you must dismiss that idea , it is not that; I abominate injustice, I am not suffering from spleen, and I’ve not copied anything out of a book—so there."
"Когда кончилась болезнь матушки, наши вечерние свидания и длинные разговоры прекратились; нам удавалось иногда меняться словами, часто пустыми и малозначащими, но мне любо было давать всему свое значение, свою цену особую, подразумеваемую.

Так прошло несколько недель…","When my mother's illness ended, our evening meetings and long conversations ceased; we sometimes succeeded in exchanging words, often empty and meaningless, but I was pleased to give everything its meaning, its special, implied price.

"Начали гневно: «Как же это вы, сударь! Чего вы смотрите? нужная бумага, нужно к спеху, а вы ее портите. И как же вы это», – тут его превосходительство обратились к Евстафию Ивановичу. Я только слышу, как до меня звуки слов долетают: «Нераденье! неосмотрительность! Вводите в неприятности!» Я раскрыл было рот для чего-то. Хотел было прощения просить да не мог, убежать – покуситься не смел, и тут… тут, маточка, такое случилось, что я и теперь едва перо держу от стыда. Моя пуговка – ну ее к бесу – пуговка, что висела у меня на ниточке – вдруг сорвалась, отскочила, запрыгала (я, видно, задел ее нечаянно), зазвенела, покатилась и прямо, так-таки прямо, проклятая, к стопам его превосходительства, и это посреди всеобщего молчания! Вот и все было мое оправдание, все извинение, весь ответ, все, что я собирался сказать его превосходительству! Последствия были ужасны! Его превосходительство тотчас обратили внимание на фигуру мою и на мой костюм. Я вспомнил, что я видел в зеркале: я бросился ловить пуговку! Нашла на меня дурь! Нагнулся, хочу взять пуговку, – катается, вертится, не могу поймать, словом, и в отношении ловкости отличился. Тут уж я чувствую, что и последние силы меня оставляют, что уж все, все потеряно! Вся репутация потеряна, весь человек пропал! А тут в обоих ушах ни с того ни с сего и Тереза и Фальдони, и пошло перезванивать. Наконец поймал пуговку, приподнялся, вытянулся, да уж, коли дурак, так стоял бы себе смирно, руки по швам! Так нет же: начал пуговку к оторванным ниткам прилаживать, точно оттого она и пристанет; да еще улыбаюсь, да еще улыбаюсь. Его превосходительство отвернулись сначала, потом опять на меня взглянули – слышу, говорят Евстафию Ивановичу: «Как же?.. посмотрите, в каком он виде!.. как он!.. что он!..» Ах, родная моя, что уж тут – как он? Да что он? отличился! Слышу, Евстафий Иванович говорит: «Не замечен, ни в чем не замечен, поведения примерного, жалованья достаточно, по окладу…» – «Ну, облегчить его как-нибудь, – говорит его превосходительство. – Выдать ему вперед…» – «Да забрал, говорят, забрал, вот за столько-то времени вперед забрал. Обстоятельства, верно, такие, а поведения хорошего и не замечен, никогда не замечен». Я, ангельчик мой, горел, я в адском огне горел! Я умирал! «Ну, – говорят его превосходительство громко, – переписать же вновь поскорее; Девушкин, подойдите сюда, перепишите опять вновь без ошибки; да послушайте…» Тут его превосходительство обернулись к прочим, роздали приказания разные, и все разошлись. Только что разошлись они, его превосходительство поспешно вынимают книжник [11] и из него сторублевую. «Вот, – говорят они, – чем могу, считайте, как хотите…» – да и всунул мне в руку. Я, ангел мой, вздрогнул, вся душа моя потряслась; не знаю, что было со мною; я было схватить их ручку хотел. А он-то весь покраснел, мой голубчик, да – вот уж тут ни на волосок от правды не отступаю, родная моя: взял мою руку недостойную, да и потряс ее, так-таки взял да потряс, словно ровне своей, словно такому же, как сам, генералу. «Ступайте, говорит, чем могу… Ошибок не делайте, а теперь грех пополам».","They began angrily: “How are you, sir! What are you watching? the right paper, you need to hurry, and you spoil it. And how can you do it, ”here His Excellency turned to Evstafy Ivanovich. I only hear the sounds of words reach me: “Negligence! indiscretion! Get into trouble!"" I opened my mouth for something. I wanted to ask for forgiveness, but I couldn’t, to run away - I didn’t dare to encroach, and then ... here, mother, it happened that even now I can hardly hold my pen from shame. My button - well, to hell with it - the button that was hanging on my thread - suddenly fell off, bounced off, jumped (I apparently hit it by accident), rang, rolled and straight, so straight, cursed, at the feet of His Excellency and this is in the middle of total silence! That was all my excuse, all my excuse, all my answer, all I was going to say to His Excellency! The consequences were terrible! His Excellency immediately drew attention to my figure and my costume. I remembered what I saw in the mirror: I rushed to catch the button! Found a fool on me! I bent down, I want to take a button, - it rolls, spins, I can’t catch it, in a word, and in terms of dexterity, I distinguished myself. Here I feel that even the last strength leaves me, that everything, everything is lost! All reputation is lost, the whole person is gone! And then in both ears, for no reason at all, Teresa and Faldoni, and went to call back. Finally he caught the button, got up, stretched out, yes, if he was a fool, he would have stood still to himself, his hands at his sides! But no: he began to fit the button to the torn threads, as if that's why it would stick; Yes, I'm still smiling, and I'm still smiling. His Excellency turned away at first, then looked at me again - I hear them say to Evstafy Ivanovich: “How is it? .. look at what form he is! .. how he is! .. what he is! here, how is he? What is he? distinguished himself! I hear Evstafiy Ivanovich say: “Not noticed, not noticed in anything, exemplary behavior, salary enough, according to salary ...” “Well, make it easier somehow,” says His Excellency. - Give him ahead ... ""-"" Yes, he took it, they say, he took it, he took it in advance for so much time. The circumstances, it’s true, are such, but good behavior has never been noticed, never noticed. ” I, my angel, was on fire, I was on fire in hell! I was dying! “Well,” His Excellency says loudly, “rewrite it again as soon as possible; Devushkin, come here, rewrite again without error; Yes, listen ... ”Here His Excellency turned to the others, distributed various orders, and everyone dispersed. As soon as they parted, His Excellency hurriedly takes out the scribe [11] and from it a hundred-ruble note. “Here,” they say, “whatever I can, consider it how you want ...” - and he put it in my hand. I, my angel, shuddered, my whole soul shook; I don't know what happened to me; I was about to grab their pen. And he blushed all over, my dear, yes - here I don’t deviate a hair’s breadth from the truth, my dear: he took my unworthy hand, and shook it, he took it and shook it, as if on a par with his own, as if the same , like himself, to the general. “Go, he says, as much as I can ... Don’t make mistakes, and now it’s a sin in half.”","He began angrily: “What is this you have done, sir? Why are you not more careful? The document was wanted in a hurry, and you have gone and spoiled it. What do you think of it?”—the last being addressed to Evstafi Ivanovitch. More I did not hear, except for some flying exclamations of “What negligence and carelessness! How awkward this is!” and so on. I opened my mouth to say something or other; I tried to beg pardon, but could not. To attempt to leave the room, I had not the hardihood. Then there happened something the recollection of which causes the pen to tremble in my hand with shame. A button of mine—the devil take it!—a button of mine that was hanging by a single thread suddenly broke off, and hopped and skipped and rattled and rolled until it had reached the feet of his Excellency himself— this amid a profound general silence! THAT was what came of my intended self-justification and plea for mercy! THAT was the only answer that I had to return to my chief! The sequel I shudder to relate. At once his Excellency’s attention became drawn to my figure and costume. I remembered what I had seen in the mirror, and hastened to pursue the button. Obstinacy of a sort seized upon me, and I did my best to arrest the thing, but it slipped away, and kept turning over and over, so that I could not grasp it, and made a sad spectacle of myself with my awkwardness. Then there came over me a feeling that my last remaining strength was about to leave me, and that all, all was lost—reputation, manhood, everything! In both ears I seemed to hear the voices of Theresa and Phaldoni. At length, however, I grasped the button, and, raising and straightening myself, stood humbly with clasped hands—looking a veritable fool! But no. First of all I tried to attach the button to the ragged threads, and smiled each time that it broke away from them, and smiled again. In the beginning his Excellency had turned away, but now he threw me another glance, and I heard him say to Evstafi Ivanovitch: “What on earth is the matter with the fellow? Look at the figure he cuts! Who to God is he?” Ah, beloved, only to hear that, “Who to God is he?” Truly I had made myself a marked man! In reply to his Excellency Evstafi murmured: “He is no one of any note, though his character is good. Besides, his salary is sufficient as the scale goes.” “Very well, then; but help him out of his difficulties somehow,” said his Excellency. “Give him a trifle of salary in advance.” “It is all forestalled,” was the reply. “He drew it some time ago. But his record is good. There is nothing against him.” At this I felt as though I were in Hell fire. I could actually have died! “Well, well,” said his Excellency, “let him copy out the document a second time. Dievushkin, come here. You are to make another copy of this paper, and to make it as quickly as possible.” With that he turned to some other officials present, issued to them a few orders, and the company dispersed. No sooner had they done so than his Excellency hurriedly pulled out a pocket-book, took thence a note for a hundred roubles, and, with the words, “Take this. It is as much as I can afford. Treat it as you like,” placed the money in my hand! At this, dearest, I started and trembled, for I was moved to my very soul. What next I did I hardly know, except that I know that I seized his Excellency by the hand. But he only grew very red, and then— no, I am not departing by a hair’s-breadth from the truth—it is true—that he took this unworthy hand in his, and shook it! Yes, he took this hand of mine in his, and shook it, as though I had been his equal, as though I had been a general like himself! “Go now,” he said. “This is all that I can do for you. Make no further mistakes, and I will overlook your fault.”","Angrily, he began: ‘What is the meaning of this, sir? Where was your concentration? An important document, urgently required, and you go and spoil it. What is the meaning of it, eh?’ At that point His Excellency turned to Yevstafy Ivanovich. I could only hear certain isolated words and phrases: ‘Negligence! Indiscretion! You will get us into trouble!’ For some reason I suddenly had an urge to open my mouth. I wanted to beg forgiveness, but could not, I wanted to flee, but dared not attempt to, and then… then, little mother, something happened that even now makes the pen want to fall from my hand. One of my metal buttons – the devil take it – a button which had been hanging from my uniform by a thread – suddenly fell off (I must have brushed against it by accident), bounced on the floor with a ping, and rolled straight, just like that, the accursed object, to His Excellency is feet – and this while everyone was completely silent, too! There went any hope I might have had of excusing myself, of making an apology, of accounting for my misdeed – all the things I had been preparing to say to His Excellency! What happened next was dreadful. His Excellency at once fastened his attention on my appearance and on what I was wearing. I recalled what I had seen in the mirror: I rushed to retrieve the button! I lost my head! I stooped down and tried to get hold of the button, but it spun and rolled, in short, I couldn’t catch hold of it, and gave a fine display of dexterity in the process. Then I suddenly felt the last of my strength desert me, and knew that all, all was lost! My entire reputation was ruined, I was finished as a human being! And then, for no reason at all, I started to hear the voices of Teresa and Falcon, and my ears began to ring. At last I managed to retrieve the button, got to my feet, straightened myself up, and had I not been such a fool I would have stood to attention and kept still. But oh, no: I began pressing the button against the torn-off threads, as though that would make it stay on again; and, what is more, I smiled, and smiled again. At first His Excellency turned away, but then he glanced at me again – I could hear him saying to yevstafy Voinovich: ‘What on earth?… Look at the state he is in! … How does he… What does he…’ Oh, my darling, the sound of those words! I knew that this time I had truly excelled myself! I heard yevstafy Voinovich say: ‘He has a good record, has never put a foot wrong–exemplary conduct, draws a reasonable salary, in accordance with his grade…’ Well, do something to ease his position,’ said His Excellency. ‘Give him something in advance.’ ‘But he’s already been paid,’ Yevstay Voinovich replied. ‘ He’s been paid in advance for ages now. He must be having some difficulties or other – but he’s always shown good conduct, and he’s got a good record, a spotless record.’ I burned, my little angel, I burned in the fires of hell! I died inwardly! ‘ Well,’ His Excellency said in a loud voice, ‘it must be copied out again, and quickly; Devshkin, come here and copy it out again, without mistakes this time; and listen…’ At that point His Excellency turned to the other people present and issued various instructions; then they all went their separate ways. No sooner had they dispersed than His Excellency hurriedly took out his pocket-book and produced a hundred ruble note from it. ‘Here,’ he said. ‘It is the least I can do, look on it as you please…’–and he shoved it into my hand. My angel, I gave a start of shock, my whole being was shaken; I don’t know what came over me–I tried to kiss his hand. But he blushed all over, my little dove, and–I depart from the truth by not one hair is breaddi, my darling–he took my unworthy hand and shook.it, shook it properly as though it were the hand of someone who was his equal, someone equal in rank to himself, a general. ‘Off you go,’ he said, ‘it is the least I can do… Don’t make any more mistakes, but on this occasion we’ll manage to get by.’","He began, angrily: “What were you about, sir? Where were your eyes? The copy was wanted; it was wanted in a hurry, and you spoil it.” At this point, his Excellency turned toYevstafy Ivanovitch. I could only catch a word here and there: “Negligence! Carelessness! You will get us into difficulties!” I would have opened my mouth to say something. I wanted to beg for forgiveness, but I could not; I wanted to run away, but dared not attempt it, and then ... then, Varinka, something happened so awful that I can hardly hold my pen, for shame, even now. A button—the devil take the button—which was hanging by a thread on my uniform—suddenly flew off, bounced on the floor (I must have caught hold of it accidentally) with a jingle, the damned thing, and rolled straight to his Excellency’s feet, and that in the midst of a profound silence! And that was my only justification, my sole apology, my only answer, all that I had to say to his Excellency! What followed was awful. His Excellency’s attention was at once turned to my appearance and my attire. I remembered what I had seen in the looking-glass; I flew to catch the button! Some idiocy possessed me! I bent down, I tried to pick up the button—it twirled and rolled, I couldn’t pick it up—in fact, I distinguished myself by my agility. Then I felt that my last faculties were deserting me, that everything, everything was lost, my whole reputation was lost, my dignity as a man was lost, and then, apropos of nothing, I had the voices ofTeresa and Faldoni ringing in my ears. At last I picked up the button, stood up and drew myself erect, and if I were a fool I might at least have stood quietly with my hands at my sides! But not a bit of it. I began fitting the button to the torn threads as though it might hang on, and I actually smiled, actually smiled. His Excellency turned away at first, then he glanced at me again— I heard him say to Yevstafy Ivanovitch: “How is this? ... Look at him! ... What is he? ... What sort of man? ...” Ah, my own, think of that! “What is he?” and, “what sort of man?” I had distinguished myself! I heard Yevstafy Ivanovitch say: “No note against him, no note against him for anything, behaviour excellent, salary in accordance with his grade ...” “Well, assist him in some way, let him have something in advance,” says his Excellency.... “But he has had an advance,” he said; “he has had his salary in advance for such and such a time. He is apparently in difficulties, but his conduct is good, and there is no note, there never has been a note against him.” My angel, I was burning, burning in the fires of hell! I was dying.... “Well,” said his Excellency, “make haste and copy it again; Dyevushkin, come here, copy it over again without a mistake; and listen ...” Here his Excellency turned to the others, gave them various instructions and they all went away. As soon as they had gone, his Excellency hurriedly took out his notebook and from it took a hundred-rouble note. “Here,” said he, “take it as you like, so far as I can help you, take it .. ” and he thrust it into my hand. I trembled, my angel, my whole soul was quivering; I don’t know what happened to me, I tried to seize his hand to kiss it, but he flushed crimson, my darling, and—here I am not departing one hair’s breadth from the truth, my own—he took my unworthy hand and shook it, just took it and shook it, as though I had been his equal, as though I had been just such a General as himself. “You can go,” he said; “whatever I can do for you ... don’t make mistakes, but there, no great harm done this time.”"

"Я так была поражена его предложением, что сама не знаю, отчего заплакала. Он принял мои слезы за благодарность и сказал мне, что он всегда был уверен, что я добрая, чувствительная и ученая девица, но что он не прежде, впрочем, решился на сию меру, как разузнав со всею подробностию о моем теперешнем поведении. Тут он расспрашивал о вас, сказал, что про все слышал, что вы благородных правил человек, что он с своей стороны не хочет быть у вас в долгу и что довольно ли вам будет пятьсот рублей за все, что вы для меня сделали? Когда же я ему объяснила, что вы для меня то сделали, чего никакими деньгами не заплатишь, то он сказал мне, что все вздор, что все это романы, что я еще молода и стихи читаю, что романы губят молодых девушек, что книги только нравственность портят и что он терпеть не может никаких книг; советовал прожить его годы и тогда об людях говорить; «тогда, – прибавил он, – и людей узнаете». Потом он сказал, чтобы я поразмыслила хорошенько об его предложениях, что ему весьма будет неприятно, если я такой важный шаг сделаю необдуманно, прибавил, что необдуманность и увлечение губят юность неопытную, но что он чрезвычайно желает с моей стороны благоприятного ответа, что, наконец, в противном случае, он принужден будет жениться в Москве на купчихе, потому что, говорит он, я присягнул негодяя-племянника лишить наследства. Он оставил насильно у меня на пяльцах пятьсот рублей, как он сказал, на конфекты; сказал, что в деревне я растолстею, как лепешка, что буду у него как сыр в масле кататься, что у него теперь ужасно много хлопот, что он целый день по делам протаскался и что теперь между делом забежал ко мне. Тут он ушел. Я долго думала, я много передумала, я мучилась, думая, друг мой, наконец я решилась. Друг мой, я выйду за него, я должна согласиться на его предложение. Если кто может избавить меня от моего позора, возвратить мне честное имя, отвратить от меня бедность, лишения и несчастия в будущем, так это единственно он. Чего же мне ожидать от грядущего, чего еще спрашивать у судьбы? Федора говорит, что своего счастия терять не нужно; говорит – что же в таком случае и называется счастием? Я по крайней мере не нахожу другого пути для себя, бесценный друг мой. Что мне делать? Работою я и так все здоровье испортила; работать постоянно я не могу. В люди идти? – я с тоски исчахну, к тому же я никому не угожу. Я хворая от природы, и потому всегда буду бременем на чужих руках. Конечно, я и теперь не в рай иду, но что же мне делать, друг мой, что же мне делать? Из чего выбирать мне?","I was so struck by his proposal that I myself don’t know why I started crying. He took my tears for gratitude and told me that he had always been convinced that I was a kind, sensitive and learned girl, but that he had not, however, decided on this measure before, as having found out in full detail about my present behavior. Then he asked about you, said that he had heard about everything, that you were a man of noble rules, that he, for his part, did not want to be in your debt, and that five hundred rubles would be enough for you for everything you did for me? When I explained to him that you did something for me that you can’t pay with any money, he told me that it’s all nonsense, that it’s all novels, that I’m still young and read poetry, that novels ruin young girls, that books only morality is spoiled and that he cannot stand any books; advised to live his years and then talk about people; “Then,” he added, “and you will recognize the people.” Then he told me to think carefully about his proposals, that it would be very unpleasant for him if I took such an important step thoughtlessly, he added that thoughtlessness and passion ruin inexperienced youth, but that he extremely desires a favorable answer from me, that, finally Otherwise, he will be forced to marry a merchant in Moscow, because, he says, I swore an oath to disinherit my scoundrel-nephew. He forcibly left five hundred rubles on my embroidery frame, as he said, for sweets; he said that in the countryside I would get fat like a cake, that I would ride like cheese in butter with him, that now he had an awful lot of trouble, that he had been dragging himself around on business all day and that now he ran to me in between times. Here he left. I thought for a long time, I changed my mind a lot, I suffered, thinking, my friend, finally I decided. My friend, I will marry him, I must agree to his proposal. If anyone can save me from my disgrace, restore my honest name, avert poverty, deprivation and misfortune from me in the future, it is only he. What can I expect from the future, what else can I ask fate? Fedora says that there is no need to lose your happiness; says - what, then, is called happiness? At least I do not find another way for myself, my priceless friend. What should I do? I have already ruined my health with my work; I can't work all the time. To go to people? - I will wither away from melancholy, besides, I will not please anyone. I am sick by nature, and therefore I will always be a burden in the hands of others. Of course, even now I am not going to heaven, but what am I to do, my friend, what am I to do? What should I choose from?","So thunderstruck was I with the proposal that I could only burst into tears. These tears he interpreted as a sign of gratitude, for he told me that he had always felt assured of my good sense, cleverness, and sensibility, but that hitherto he had hesitated to take this step until he should have learned precisely how I was getting on. Next he asked me some questions about YOU; saying that he had heard of you as a man of good principle, and that since he was unwilling to remain your debtor, would a sum of five hundred roubles repay you for all you had done for me? To this I replied that your services to myself had been such as could never be requited with money; whereupon, he exclaimed that I was talking rubbish and nonsense; that evidently I was still young enough to read poetry; that romances of this kind were the undoing of young girls, that books only corrupted morality, and that, for his part, he could not abide them. “You ought to live as long as I have done,” he added, “and THEN you will see what men can be.” With that he requested me to give his proposal my favourable consideration—saying that he would not like me to take such an important step unguardedly, since want of thought and impetuosity often spelt ruin to youthful inexperience, but that he hoped to receive an answer in the affirmative. “Otherwise,” said he, “I shall have no choice but to marry a certain merchant’s daughter in Moscow, in order that I may keep my vow to deprive my nephew of the inheritance. ”—Then he pressed five hundred roubles into my hand—to buy myself some bonbons, as he phrased it—and wound up by saying that in the country I should grow as fat as a doughnut or a cheese rolled in butter; that at the present moment he was extremely busy; and that, deeply engaged in business though he had been all day, he had snatched the present opportunity of paying me a visit. At length he departed. For a long time I sat plunged in reflection. Great though my distress of mind was, I soon arrived at a decision.... My friend, I am going to marry this man; I have no choice but to accept his proposal. If anyone could save me from this squalor, and restore to me my good name, and avert from me future poverty and want and misfortune, he is the man to do it. What else have I to look for from the future? What more am I to ask of fate? Thedora declares that one need NEVER lose one’s happiness; but what, I ask HER, can be called happiness under such circumstances as mine? At all events I see no other road open, dear friend. I see nothing else to be done. I have worked until I have ruined my health. I cannot go on working forever. Shall I go out into the world? Nay; I am worn to a shadow with grief, and become good for nothing. Sickly by nature, I should merely be a burden upon other folks. Of course this marriage will not bring me paradise, but what else does there remain, my friend—what else does there remain? What other choice is left?","I was so shocked by his proposal that – I don’t know why – I burst into tears. He interpreted this as a sign of gratitude and told me that he had always been convinced I was a goodhearted, sensitive and educated woman, but that he had not been able to bring himself to take this step until he had made detailed enquiries as to my present behaviour. Then he enquired about you, said he had heard all about you, that you were a man of decent principles, that he for his part did not want to be in your debt and asked if five hundred rubles would suffice to pay you for all you had done for me. When I explained to him that what you had done for me could never be paid for in money, he told me that that was just a lot of romantic nonsense, that I was young and read too many poems and novels, that novels were the ruin of young girls, that books were harmful to morality and that he could not endure books of any kind; he advised me to wait until I was his age before making judgements about people. ‘Then you’ll have some idea,’ he added. Then he told me to think his proposal over carefully, that he would find it very displeasing were I to take such an important step rashly, added that rashness and impulsiveness could be the ruin of inexperienced youth, but that he greatly desired a favourable reply from me, and that if such a reply were not forthcoming he would be compelled to marry a merchant’s daughter in Moscow, because, he said, ‘I have sworn to deprive that no-good nephew of mine of his inheritance.’ He forced me to accept the five hundred rubles – isweet-money’, as he put it; he said that in the country I would ‘grow as round as a doughnut’, that in his house I would live in clover, that he had a fearful amount of business to attend to just now, that he trudged around all day seeing to it and that he had dropped in to see me between two appointments. Then he left. I thought for a long time, I rediance on a great many things and went through agonies of indecision as I did so, my friend; and at last I made up my mind. My friend, I am going to marry him. I must accept his proposal. If there is anyone who can save me from my shame, restore to me my honourable reputation, and rescue me from poverty, deprivation and unhappiness, it is him, and him alone. What more can I expect from the future, what more can I ask of fate? Fedora says one mustn’t sacrifice one is happiness. ‘What is happiness in a case like this?’ she says. At any rate, I can’t see another way forward for myself, my precious friend. What would I do? I have ruined my health with work as it is; I cannot work all the time. Become a serving-maid? I would die of misery, and in any case I’d be no good to anyone. I’m sickly by nature, and so I’ll always be a burden to others. Of course, I know I’m not exactly going to paradise now, but what else can I do? What choice do I have?","I was so overcome at his offer that, I don’t know why, I began crying. He took my tears for gratitude and told me he had always been sure I was a good, feeling, and educated girl, but that he had not been able to make up his mind to take this step till he had found out about my present behaviour in full detail. Then he asked me about you, said that he had heard all about it, that you were a man of good principles, that he did not want to be indebted to you and asked whether five hundred roubles would be enough for all that you had done for me. When I explained to him that what you had done for me no money could repay, he said that it was all nonsense, that that was all romantic stuff out of novels, that I was young and read poetry, that novels were the ruin of young girls, that books were destructive of morality and that he could not bear books of any sort, he advised me to wait till I was his age and then talk about people. “Then,” he added, “you will know what men are like.” Then he said I was to think over his offer thoroughly, that he would very much dislike it if I were to take such an important step thoughtlessly; he added that thoughtlessness and impulsiveness were the ruin of inexperienced youth, but that he quite hoped for a favourable answer from me, but that in the opposite event, he should be forced to marry some Moscow shopkeeper’s daughter, “because,” he said, “I have sworn that good-for-nothing nephew shall not have the estate.” He forced five hundred roubles into my hands, as he said, “to buy sweetmeats”. He said that in the country I should grow as round as a bun, that with him I should be living on the fat of the land, that he had a terrible number of things to see to now, that he was dragging about all day on business, and that he had just slipped in to see me between his engagements. Then he went away. I thought for a long time, I pondered many things, I wore myself out thinking, my friend; at last I made up my mind. My friend, I shall marry him. I ought to accept his offer. If anyone can rescue me from my shame, restore my good name, and ward off poverty, privation and misfortune from me in the future, it is he and no one else. What more can one expect from the future, what more can one expect from fate? Fedora says I must not throw away my good fortune; she says, if this isn’t good fortune, what is? Anyway, I can find no other course for me, my precious friend. What am I to do? I have ruined my health with work as it is; I can’t go on working continually. Go into a family? I should pine away with depression, besides I should be of no use to anyone. I am of a sickly constitution, and so I shall always be a burden on other people. Of course I am not going into a paradise, but what am I to do, my friend, what am I to do? What choice have I?"

"Да, впрочем, довольно об этой материи; я ведь это все так пишу, ангельчик мой, ради баловства, чтобы вас потешить. Прощайте, голубчик мой! Много я вам тут настрочил, но это, собственно, оттого, что я сегодня в самом веселом душевном расположении. Обедали-то мы все вместе сегодня у Ратазяева, так (шалуны они, маточка!) пустили в ход такой романеи… ну да уж что вам писать об этом! Вы только смотрите не придумайте там чего про меня, Варенька. Я ведь это все так. Книжек пришлю, непременно пришлю… Ходит здесь по рукам Поль-де-Кока одно сочинение, только Поль-де-Кока-то вам, маточка, и не будет… Ни-ни! для вас Поль-де-Кок не годится. Говорят про него, маточка, что он всех критиков петербургских в благородное негодование приводит. Посылаю вам фунтик конфеток, – нарочно для вас купил. Скушайте, душечка, да при каждой конфетке меня поминайте. Только леденец-то вы не грызите, а так пососите его только, а то зубки разболятся. А вы, может быть, и цукаты любите? – вы напишите. Ну, прощайте же, прощайте. Христос с вами, голубчик мой. А я пребуду навсегда","Yes, however, enough about this matter; I'm writing it all like this, my angel, for the sake of pampering, to amuse you. Farewell, my dove! I scribbled a lot for you here, but this, in fact, is because I am in the most cheerful state of mind today. We all dined together today at Ratazyaev's, so (they are naughty, mother!) they launched such novels ... well, what can you write about it! You just look, don’t come up with anything about me, Varenka. I'm all like that. I’ll send books, I’ll certainly send them ... There’s only one essay going around Paul de Coca’s hands, only there won’t be Paul de Coca for you, mother, ... No, no! Paul de Coq is no good for you. They say about him, mother, that he brings all Petersburg critics to noble indignation. I am sending you a pound of sweets - I bought it for you on purpose. Eat, darling, and remember me with every candy. Only you don’t gnaw on a lollipop, but just suck on it, otherwise your teeth will ache. And you, maybe, and candied fruit love? - you will write. Well, goodbye, goodbye. Christ be with you, my dear. And I will stay forever","But enough of this. I write this sort of thing both to amuse myself and to divert your thoughts. Goodbye now, my angel. This is a long epistle that I am sending you, but the reason is that today I feel in good spirits after dining at Rataziaev’s. There I came across a novel which I hardly know how to describe to you. Do not think the worse of me on that account, even though I bring you another book instead (for I certainly mean to bring one). The novel in question was one of Paul de Kock’s, and not a novel for you to read. No, no! Such a work is unfit for your eyes. In fact, it is said to have greatly offended the critics of St. Petersburg. Also, I am sending you a pound of bonbons—bought specially for yourself. Each time that you eat one, beloved, remember the sender. Only, do not bite the iced ones, but suck them gently, lest they make your teeth ache. Perhaps, too, you like comfits? Well, write and tell me if it is so. Goodbye, goodbye. Christ watch over you, my darling!—Always your faithful friend,","But, anyway, enough of this topic: I’m really just writing all this for fun, my little angel, in order to entertain you. Goodbye, my little dove! If I’ve scribbled you a lot it’s because I’m in such a happy frame of mind today. We all ate dinner together in Ratazyayev is room and they started passing round a Romany wine* such as you’ve never tasted in your life (they’re such frolicsome fellows, little mother!) … But why should I write to you about that? Now don’t go getting the wrong idea about me, Varenka. I just tell you all these things for fun. I shall send you the books, I promise I shall… There’s a novel by Paul de Kock * going the rounds among us here, but I shall not send you Paul de Kock, little mother… No, no! Paul de Kock isn’t good enough for you. They say about him, little mother, that he provokes all the St Petersburg critics to righteous indignation. I enclose a pound ofsweets – Ibought them especially for you. Eat them, my darling, and remember me each time you put one in your mouth. Only mind and suck the boiled sweets, and not crunch them, or else you will get toothache. Perhaps you like candied fruit? Do write and tell me. Well, goodbye, then, goodbye. May Christ be with you, my little dove. And I shall remain forever","But enough of that subject; I write all this for fun, my little angel, to amuse you. Good-bye, my darling, I have scribbled you a lot of nonsense, but that is just because I am in a very good humour to-day. We all dined together to-day at Ratazyaev’s (they are rogues, Varinka dear), and brought out such a cordial.... But there, why write to you about that! Only mind you don’t imagine anything about me, Varinka. I don’t mean anything by it. I will send you the books, I will certainly send them.... One of Paul de Kock ’s novels8 is being passed round from one to another, but Paul de Kock will not do for you, my precious.... No, no! Paul de Kock won’t do for you. They say of him, Varinka dear, that he rouses all the Petersburg critics to righteous indignation. I send you a pound of sweetmeats—I bought them on purpose for you. Do you hear, darling? think of me at every sweetmeat. Only don’t nibble up the sugar-candy but only suck it, or you will get toothache. And perhaps you like candied peel?—write and tell me. Well, good-bye, good-bye. Christ be with you, my darling! I remain ever,"
"Уведомляю вас, родная моя, что у нас в квартире случилось прежалостное происшествие, истинно-истинно жалости достойное! Сегодня, в пятом часу утра, умер у Горшкова маленький. Я не знаю только от чего, скарлатина, что ли, была какая-то, господь его знает! Навестил я этих Горшковых. Ну, маточка, вот бедно-то у них! И какой беспорядок! Да и не диво: все семейство живет в одной комнате, только что ширмочками для благопристойности разгороженной. У них уж и гробик стоит – простенький, но довольно хорошенький гробик; готовый купили, мальчик-то был лет девяти; надежды, говорят, подавал. А жалость смотреть на них, Варенька! Мать не плачет, но такая грустная, бедная. Им, может быть, и легче, что вот уж один с плеч долой; а у них еще двое осталось, грудной да девочка маленькая, так лет шести будет с небольшим. Что за приятность, в самом деле, видеть, что вот-де страдает ребенок, да еще детище родное, а ему и помочь даже нечем! Отец сидит в старом, засаленном фраке, на изломанном стуле. Слезы текут у него, да, может быть, и не от горести, а так, по привычке, глаза гноятся. Такой он чудной! Все краснеет, когда с ним заговоришь, смешается и не знает, что отвечать. Маленькая девочка, дочка, стоит, прислонившись к гробу, да такая, бедняжка, скучная, задумчивая! А не люблю я, маточка, Варенька, когда ребенок задумывается; смотреть неприятно! Кукла какая-то из тряпок на полу возле нее лежит, – не играет; на губах пальчик держит; стоит себе – не пошевелится. Ей хозяйка конфетку дала; взяла, а не ела. Грустно, Варенька – а?","I notify you, my dear, that a pitiful incident happened in our apartment, truly, truly worthy of pity! Today, at five o'clock in the morning, the little one died at Gorshkov's. I just don’t know from what, scarlet fever, or something, was some kind, God knows! I visited these Gorshkovs. Well, mother, they are poor! And what a mess! And no wonder: the whole family lives in the same room, which has just been partitioned off with screens for decency. They already have a coffin - a simple, but pretty pretty coffin; ready bought, the boy was about nine years old; hope, they say, gave. What a pity to look at them, Varenka! Mother does not cry, but she is so sad, poor. It may be easier for them that one is off their shoulders; and they still have two left, a baby girl and a little girl, so she will be about six years old. What a pleasure, indeed, to see that a child is suffering, and even a child of his own, and there is nothing even to help him! Father is sitting in an old, greasy tailcoat, on a broken chair. Tears flow from him, yes, maybe not from sorrow, but, out of habit, his eyes fester. He is so wonderful! Everything turns red when you talk to him, he gets confused and does not know what to answer. A little girl, a daughter, is standing leaning against a coffin, but such a poor thing, boring, thoughtful! And I don’t like, mother, Varenka, when a child thinks; look unpleasant! A doll of one of the rags on the floor next to her lies - does not play; holds a finger on the lips; stands for himself - does not move. The hostess gave her a candy; took, not eaten. It's sad, Varenka - huh?","MY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,—I have to tell you that a sad event has happened in this house—an event to excite one’s utmost pity. This morning, about five o’clock, one of Gorshkov’s children died of scarlatina, or something of the kind. I have been to pay the parents a visit of condolence, and found them living in the direst poverty and disorder. Nor is that surprising, seeing that the family lives in a single room, with only a screen to divide it for decency’s sake. Already the coffin was standing in their midst—a plain but decent shell which had been bought ready-made. The child, they told me, had been a boy of nine, and full of promise. What a pitiful spectacle! Though not weeping, the mother, poor woman, looked broken with grief. After all, to have one burden the less on their shoulders may prove a relief, though there are still two children left—a babe at the breast and a little girl of six! How painful to see these suffering children, and to be unable to help them! The father, clad in an old, dirty frockcoat, was seated on a dilapidated chair. Down his cheeks there were coursing tears—though less through grief than owing to a long-standing affliction of the eyes. He was so thin, too! Always he reddens in the face when he is addressed, and becomes too confused to answer. A little girl, his daughter, was leaning against the coffin—her face looking so worn and thoughtful, poor mite! Do you know, I cannot bear to see a child look thoughtful. On the floor there lay a rag doll, but she was not playing with it as, motionless, she stood there with her finger to her lips. Even a bon-bon which the landlady had given her she was not eating. Is it not all sad, sad, Barbara?","I must inform you, my dear lady, that a most doleful event has taken place in our lodging-house, one that is truly, truly worthy of compassion! This morning, at about five a.m., Gorshkov’s small son died, I do not know what of; possibly it was some form of scarlet fever, but God alone knows! I paid a visit to those Gorshkovs. Oh, little mother, what poverty they live in! And what chaos! And it’s no wonder: the entire family lives in one room, which they have divided up with screens for the sake of propriety. They already have a little coffin prepared – a simple one, but quite pretty; they bought it ready-made, the boy was about nine; they say he had promise. But it is pitiful to see them, Varenka! The mother does not cry, but she is so sad, so poor. Perhaps things will be easier for them now that they have got one off their shoulders; but they still have the other two, a boy infant in arms and a little girl who must be six and a bit. There’s not really much that’s pleasant about watching a child, one’s own child, suffer and not being able to do anything about it. The father sits on a broken chair, wearing an old, grease-stained jacket. The tears stream down his face, perhaps not from grief, however, but simply from habit – his eyes are festering. What a queer fellow he is! He keeps blushing when you talk to him, he grows confused and doesn’t know what to say. The little girl, the daughter, stood leaning against the coffin – such a sad, thoughtful child, poor thing! I don’t like it when children are thoughtful, Varenka, little mother; it’s an unpleasant sight! There was some kind of rag-doll lying on the floor beside her – she wasn’t playing with it; she had her finger in her mouth, and just stood there, without making the slightest motion. The landlady gave her a sweet; she took it, but did not eat it. That was sad, Varenka, wasn’t it?","I must tell you, my own, that a very pitiful thing has happened in our flat, truly, truly, deserving of pity! Between four and five this morning Gorshkov’s little boy died. I don’t know what he died of. It seemed to be a sort of scarlatina, God only knows! I went to see these Gorshkovs. Oh, my dear soul, how poor they are! And what disorder! And no wonder; the whole family lives in one room, only divided by a screen for decency. There was a little coffin standing in the room already—a simple little coffin, but rather pretty; they bought it ready-made; the boy was nine years old, he was a promising boy, they say. But it was pitiful to look at them, Varinka! The mother did not cry, but she was so sad, so poor. And perhaps it will make it easier for them to have got one off their shoulders; but there are still two left, a baby, and a little girl, not much more than six. There’s not much comfort really in seeing a child suffer, especially one’s own little child, and having no means of helping him! The father was sitting in a greasy old dress suit on a broken chair. The tears were flowing from his eyes, but perhaps not from grief, but just the usual thing—his eyes are inflamed. He’s such a strange fellow! He always turns red when you speak to him, gets confused and does not know what to answer. The little girl, their daughter, stood leaning against the coffin, such a poor little, sad, brooding child! And Varinka, my darling, I don’t like it when children brood; it’s painful to see! A doll made of rags was lying on the floor beside her; she did not play with it, she held her finger on her lips; she stood, without stirring. The landlady gave her a sweetmeat; she took it but did not eat it. It was sad, Varinka, wasn’t it?"
Пришел Быков; я бросаю письмо неоконченным. Много еще хотела сказать вам. Быков уж здесь!,Bykov came; I leave the letter unfinished. There was so much more I wanted to tell you. Bykov is already here!,"Bwikov has just arrived, so I am leaving this letter unfinished. Otherwise I had much else to say to you. Bwikov is even now at the door!...",Bykov has arrived; I am leaving this letter unfinished. There was much more which I wanted to tell you. Bykov is in the room!,"Bykov has come, I leave this letter unfinished. I wanted to tell you a great deal more. Bykov is here already!"
"Слезы теснят меня, рвут меня. Прощайте.","Tears crowd me, tear me. Farewell.","Sorrow has me in its grip, and is tearing me to pieces. Goodbye.","My tears are choking me, breaking me. Farewell.","tears are choking me, rending my heart. Good-bye."
"Иногда Покровский узнавал меня, но это было редко. Он был почти все время в беспамятстве. Иногда по целым ночам он говорил с кем-то долго-долго, неясными, темными словами, и хриплый голос его глухо отдавался в тесной его комнате, словно в гробу; мне тогда становилось страшно. Особенно в последнюю ночь он был как исступленный; он ужасно страдал, тосковал; стоны его терзали мою душу. Все в доме были в каком-то испуге. Анна Федоровна все молилась, чтобы бог его прибрал поскорее. Призвали доктора. Доктор сказал, что больной умрет к утру непременно.","Sometimes Pokrovsky recognized me, but that was rare. He was unconscious most of the time. Sometimes, for whole nights, he spoke to someone for a long, long time, in indistinct, dark words, and his hoarse voice resounded dully in his cramped room, as if in a coffin; I then became scared. Especially on the last night he was like a frenzy; he suffered terribly, yearned; his groans tormented my soul. Everyone in the house was in some kind of fright. Anna Fedorovna kept praying that God would clean him up as soon as possible. The doctor was called. The doctor said that the patient would certainly die by morning.","Sometimes Pokrovski would know who I was, but not often, for more usually he was unconscious. Sometimes, too, he would talk all night with some unknown person, in dim, mysterious language that caused his gasping voice to echo hoarsely through the narrow room as through a sepulchre; and at such times, I found the situation a strange one. During his last night he was especially lightheaded, for then he was in terrible agony, and kept rambling in his speech until my soul was torn with pity. Everyone in the house was alarmed, and Anna Thedorovna fell to praying that God might soon take him. When the doctor had been summoned, the verdict was that the patient would die with the morning.","Sometimes Pokrovsky would recognize me, but this was rare. For much the greater part of the time he was unconscious. Sometimes for whole nights on end he would talk to someone at great length, his words unclear and obscure, his hoarse voice resonating hollowly in his cramped room as in a coffin; at such times I would grow afraid. On his last night, in particular, he was like a man in a frenzy; he suffered horribly, in a misery of anguish; his groans tormented my soul. Everyone in the house was in a state of fright. Anna Fyodo rovna kept praying that God would take him quickly. The doctor was summoned. The doctor said that by morning the patient would certainly be dead.","Sometimes Pokrovsky knew me, but this was seldom. He was almost all the time unconscious. Sometimes for whole nights together he would carry on long, long conversations with someone in obscure, indistinct words and his hoarse voice resounded with a hollow echo in his narrow room as in a coffin; I used to feel terrified then. Especially on the last night he seemed in a frenzy; he suffered terribly, was in anguish; his moans wrung my heart. Everyone in the house was in alarm. Anna Fyodorovna kept praying that God would take him more quickly. They sent for the doctor. The doctor said that the patient would certainly die by the morning."

"Скоро я перестала учиться у Покровского. Меня он по-прежнему считал ребенком, резвой девочкой, на одном ряду с Сашей. Мне было это очень больно, потому что я всеми силами старалась загладить мое прежнее поведение. Но меня не замечали. Это раздражало меня более и более. Я никогда почти не говорила с Покровским вне классов, да и не могла говорить. Я краснела, мешалась и потом где-нибудь в уголку плакала от досады.","Soon I stopped studying with Pokrovsky. He still considered me a child, a frisky girl, on a par with Sasha. It was very painful for me, because I tried with all my might to make amends for my previous behavior. But they didn't notice me. This annoyed me more and more. I almost never spoke to Pokrovsky outside of classes, and I could not speak. I blushed, got in the way, and then somewhere in a corner wept with annoyance.","Soon after this I ceased to take lessons of Pokrovski. Even now he thought me a child, a raw schoolgirl, as much as he did Sasha; and this hurt me extremely, seeing that I had done so much to expiate my former behaviour. Of my efforts in this direction no notice had been taken, and the fact continued to anger me more and more. Scarcely ever did I address a word to my tutor between school hours, for I simply could not bring myself to do it. If I made the attempt I only grew red and confused, and rushed away to weep in a corner.","Soon I stopped taking lessons with Pokrovsky. He still viewed me as a child, a naughty little girl, on a par with Sasha. This hurt me considerably, as I was doing my utmost to make up for my previous behaviour. But no one paid any attention to that. That irritated me more and more. I practically never spoke to Pokrovsky outside of lessons, nor could I speak. I blushed, was confused, and afterwards wept in a corner from disappointment.","Soon I left off having lessons with Pokrovsky. As before, he looked upon me as a child, a mischievous little girl on a level with Sasha. This hurt me very much, for I was trying my utmost to efface the impression of my behaviour in the past, but I was not noticed. That irritated me more and more. I scarcely ever spoke to Pokrovsky except at our lessons, and indeed I could not speak. I blushed and was confused, and afterwards shed tears of vexation in some corner."
"Теперь скажу несколько слов об одном самом странном, самом любопытном и самом жалком человеке из всех, которых когда-либо мне случалось встречать. Потому говорю о нем теперь, именно в этом месте моих записок, что до самой этой эпохи я почти не обращала на него никакого внимания, – так все, касавшееся Покровского, стало для меня вдруг занимательно!","Now I will say a few words about one of the strangest, most curious, and most pitiful person I have ever met. That is why I am talking about him now, precisely in this place of my notes, because until this very era I paid almost no attention to him - so everything that concerned Pokrovsky suddenly became interesting for me!","At this point, I must say a few words about the strangest, the most interesting, the most pitiable human being that I have ever come across. I speak of him now—at this particular point in these memoirs—for the reason that hitherto I had paid him no attention whatever, and began to do so now only because everything connected with Pokrovski had suddenly become of absorbing interest in my eyes.","I shall now say a few words about the strangest, most curious and most pathetic human being of all those it has been my fortune to meet. I speak of him now, at precisely this moment in my notes, because until that time I had scarcely paid him any attention – but now everything that concerned Pokrovsky suddenly acquired a special interest for me.","Now I will say a few words about the strangest, most curious and most pathetic figure I have ever chanced to meet. I speak of him now, at this passage in my diary, because until that period I had hardly paid any attention to him. But now everything that concerned Pokrovsky had suddenly become interesting to me."
"Но когда сын примет, бывало, отца хорошо, то старик себя не слышит от радости. Удовольствие проглядывало в его лице, в его жестах, в его движениях. Если сын с ним заговаривал, то старик всегда приподымался немного со стула и отвечал тихо, подобострастно, почти с благоговением и всегда стараясь употреблять отборнейшие, то есть самые смешные выражения. Но дар слова ему не давался: всегда смешается и сробеет, так что не знает, куда руки девать, куда себя девать, и после еще долго про себя ответ шепчет, как бы желая поправиться. Если же удавалось отвечать хорошо, то старик охорашивался, оправлял на себе жилетку, галстух, фрак и принимал вид собственного достоинства. А бывало, до того ободрялся, до того простирал свою смелость, что тихонько вставал со стула, подходил к полке с книгами, брал какую-нибудь книжку и даже тут же прочитывал что-нибудь, какая бы ни была книга. Все это он делал с видом притворного равнодушия и хладнокровия, как будто бы он и всегда мог так хозяйничать с сыновними книгами, как будто ему и не в диковину ласка сына. Но мне раз случилось видеть, как бедняк испугался, когда Покровский попросил его не трогать книг. Он смешался, заторопился, поставил книгу вверх ногами, потом хотел поправиться, перевернул и поставил обрезом наружу, улыбался, краснел и не знал, чем загладить свое преступление. Покровский своими советами отучал понемногу старика от дурных наклонностей, и как только видел его раза три сряду в трезвом виде, то при первом посещении давал ему на прощанье по четвертачку, по полтинничку или больше. Иногда покупал ему сапоги, галстух или жилетку. Зато старик в своей обнове был горд, как петух. Иногда он заходил к нам. Приносил мне и Саше пряничных петушков, яблоков и все, бывало, толкует с нами о Петеньке. Просил нас учиться внимательно, слушаться, говорил, что Петенька добрый сын, примерный сын и вдобавок ученый сын. Тут он так, бывало, смешно нам подмигивал левым глазком, так забавно кривлялся, что мы не могли удержаться от смеха и хохотали над ним от души. Маменька его очень любила. Но старик ненавидел Анну Федоровну, хотя был пред нею тише воды, ниже травы.","But when the son accepts, it happened, the father is good, then the old man does not hear himself for joy. Pleasure was visible in his face, in his gestures, in his movements. If his son spoke to him, the old man always rose a little from his chair and answered quietly, obsequiously, almost reverently, and always trying to use the most selective, that is, the most ridiculous expressions. But the gift of speech was not given to him: he always gets confused and shy, so that he does not know where to put his hands, where to put himself, and after a long time he whispers the answer to himself, as if wanting to get better. If he managed to answer well, then the old man would preen, straighten his waistcoat, tie, tailcoat and take on the appearance of his own dignity. And it happened that he would be so emboldened, would stretch his courage so much that he quietly got up from his chair, approached a shelf with books, took some book and even immediately read something, no matter what the book was. He did all this with an air of feigned indifference and composure, as if he could always manage his son's books in such a way, as if he were not unusual in his son's caress. But I once happened to see how frightened the poor man was when Pokrovsky asked him not to touch the books. He was confused, hurried, put the book upside down, then wanted to get better, turned it over and put it with the sawn-off side out, smiled, blushed and did not know how to make amends for his crime. With his advice, Pokrovsky gradually weaned the old man from bad inclinations, and as soon as he saw him three times in a row in a sober state, then at the first visit he gave him a quarter, fifty dollars or more as parting. Sometimes I bought him boots, a tie or a vest. But the old man in his renovation was proud as a rooster. Sometimes he visited us. He brought me and Sasha gingerbread cockerels, apples, and everything used to talk with us about Petenka. He asked us to study carefully, to obey, he said that Petenka was a good son, an exemplary son, and, in addition, a learned son. Here he used to wink at us with his left eye in such a funny way, he grimaced so funny that we could not help laughing and laughed at him heartily. Mom loved him very much. But the old man hated Anna Feodorovna, although he was quieter than water before her, lower than grass.","On the other hand, whenever the son received his father civilly the old man would be struck dumb with joy. Satisfaction would beam in his face, in his every gesture, in his every movement. And if the son deigned to engage in conversation with him, the old man always rose a little from his chair, and answered softly, sympathetically, with something like reverence, while strenuously endeavouring to make use of the most recherche (that is to say, the most ridiculous) expressions. But, alas! He had not the gift of words. Always he grew confused, and turned red in the face; never did he know what to do with his hands or with himself. Likewise, whenever he had returned an answer of any kind, he would go on repeating the same in a whisper, as though he were seeking to justify what he had just said. And if he happened to have returned a good answer, he would begin to preen himself, and to straighten his waistcoat, frockcoat and tie, and to assume an air of conscious dignity. Indeed, on these occasions he would feel so encouraged, he would carry his daring to such a pitch, that, rising softly from his chair, he would approach the bookshelves, take thence a book, and read over to himself some passage or another. All this he would do with an air of feigned indifference and sangfroid, as though he were free ALWAYS to use his son’s books, and his son’s kindness were no rarity at all. Yet on one occasion I saw the poor old fellow actually turn pale on being told by his son not to touch the books. Abashed and confused, he, in his awkward hurry, replaced the volume wrong side uppermost; whereupon, with a supreme effort to recover himself, he turned it round with a smile and a blush, as though he were at a loss how to view his own misdemeanour. Gradually, as already said, the younger Pokrovski weaned his father from his dissipated ways by giving him a small coin whenever, on three successive occasions, he (the father) arrived sober. Sometimes, also, the younger man would buy the older one shoes, or a tie, or a waistcoat; whereafter, the old man would be as proud of his acquisition as a peacock. Not infrequently, also, the old man would step in to visit ourselves, and bring Sasha and myself gingerbread birds or apples, while talking unceasingly of Petinka. Always he would beg of us to pay attention to our lessons, on the plea that Petinka was a good son, an exemplary son, a son who was in twofold measure a man of learning; after which he would wink at us so quizzingly with his left eye, and twist himself about in such amusing fashion, that we were forced to burst out laughing. My mother had a great liking for him, but he detested Anna Thedorovna—although in her presence he would be quieter than water and lowlier than the earth.","When, on the other hand, his son received his father well, the old man would be beside himself with joy. His pleasure would make itself visible in his face, his gestures, and his movements. If his son said anything to him, the old man would invariably get up slightly from his chair and reply in a quiet, servile tone bordering on reverence, always trying to use the most refined, that is, the most ridiculous expressions. But he had no gift for words: he would always grow confused and lose his nerve, since he did not know where to put his hands or to put himself, and would whisper his side of the conversation to himself for a long time afterwards, as though he were trying to correct himself. If, on the other hand, he had succeeded in answering well, the old man would preen himself, straighten his waistcoat, tie and jacket and assume an air that suggested he knew his own worth. It occasionally happened that he recovered his spirits to such an extent and grew so emboldened that he slowly rose from his chair, went over to the bookshelf, took down a book at random, and read aloud from it right there and then, whatever he had chanced to select. All this he did with an air of pretended indifference and detachment, as though he could always behave in such a lordly fashion with his son’s books, as though he found nothing remarkable about his having been treated kindly by him. I once, however, chanced to witness how frightened the poor man became when Pokrovsky asked him not to touch the books. He grew confused, began to fuss around, replaced the book upside down, then tried to put it back the right way up, turned it round and replaced it with its spine facing inward, smiled, blushed and was at a loss how to cover up his crime. By his counselling, Pokrovsky managed to wean the old man away from his self-destructive habits, and as soon as he saw him sober, let us say, on three successive occasions, then the next time the old man visited him he would give on parting a twenty-five copeck piece, a fifty-copeck piece, or more. He would sometimes buy him boots, a tie or a waistcoat. The old man would be as proud as a turkey-cock in his new clothes. Sometimes he would come to our room. He would bring cockerel-shaped honey-cakes, and apples, for Sasha and myself, and would spend all the time telling us about Petenka. He would ask us to study attentively and be obedient, saying that Petenka was a good son, an exemplary son and, what was more, a learned son. As he did so, he would wink at us ridiculously with his left eye and make such comical faces that we were unable to restrain our hilarity and laughed at him for all we were worth. Mother was very fond of him. But the old man hated Anna Fyodorovna, even though in her presence he was as quiet as a mouse.","But when the son made the father welcome, the old man was beside himself with joy. His face, his gestures, his movements all betrayed his pleasure. If his son began talking to him, the old man always rose a little from the chair and answered softly, deferentially, almost with reverence, always trying to use the choicest, that is, the most absurd expressions. But he was not blessed with the gift of words; he was always nervous and confused, so that he did not know what to do with his hands, what to do with himself, and kept whispering the answer to himself long afterwards as though trying to correct himself. If he did succeed in giving a good answer, the old man smoothed himself down, straightened his waistcoat, his tie, his coat and assumed an air of dignity. Sometimes he plucked up so much courage and grew so bold that he stealthily got up from his chair, went up to the bookshelf, took down some book and even began reading something on the spot, whatever the book might be. All this he did with an air of assumed unconcern and coolness, as though he could always do what he liked with his son’s books, as though his son’s graciousness was nothing out of the way. But I once happened to see how frightened the poor fellow was when Pokrovsky asked him not to touch the books. He grew nervous and confused, put the book back upside down, then tried to right it, turned it round and put it in with the edges outside; smiled, flushed and did not know how to efface his crime. Pokrovsky by his persuasions did succeed in turning the old man a little from his evil propensities, and whenever the son saw his father sober three times running he would give him twenty-five kopecks, fifty kopecks, or more at parting. Sometimes he would buy his father a pair of boots, a tie or a waistcoat; then the old man was as proud as a cock in his new clothes. Sometimes he used to come to us. He used to bring Sasha and me gingerbread cocks and apples and always talked to us of Petinka. He used to beg us to be attentive and obedient at lessons, used to tell us that Petinka was a good son, an exemplary son and, what was more, a learned son. Meanwhile he would wink at us so funnily with his left eye and make such amusing grimaces that we could not help smiling, and went into peals of laughter at him. Mother was very fond of him. But the old man hated Anna Fyodorovna, though he was stiller than water, humbler than grass in her presence."
"Ах, что-то будет со мною, какова-то будет моя судьба! Тяжело то, что я в такой неизвестности, что я не имею будущности, что я и предугадывать не могу о том, что со мной станется. Назад и посмотреть страшно. Там все такое горе, что сердце пополам рвется при одном воспоминании. Век буду я плакаться на злых людей, меня погубивших!","Ah, something will happen to me, what will my fate be! It is hard that I am in such uncertainty that I have no future, that I cannot foresee what will become of me. Back and look scary. There is such grief that the heart breaks in half at one memory. For a century I will cry at the evil people who killed me!","Ah, what is going to become of me? What will be my fate? To have to be so uncertain as to the future, to have to be unable to foretell what is going to happen, distresses me deeply. Even to look back at the past is horrible, for it contains sorrow that breaks my very heart at the thought of it. Yes, a whole century in tears could I spend because of the wicked people who have wrecked my life!","Oh, what is to become of me, what will be my fate? The worst of it is that I am in a state of such uncertainty, that I have no future, that I cannot even guess what will become of me. I am afraid to look back, too. There is such misery there that its mere recollection is enough to make my heart tear at the seams.","Ah, what will become of me, what will be my fate! What is painful is that I am in such uncertainty, that I have no future to look forward to, that I cannot even guess what will become of me. It is dreadful to look back, too. There is such sorrow in the past, and my heart is torn in two at the very memory of it. All my life I shall be in suffering, thanks to the wicked people who have ruined me."
"Вот я и расплакалась теперь, как дитя, увлекаясь моими воспоминаниями. Я так живо, так живо все припомнила, так ярко стало передо мною все прошедшее, а настоящее так тускло, так темно!.. Чем это кончится, чем это все кончится? Знаете ли, у меня есть какое-то убеждение, какая-то уверенность, что я умру нынче осенью. Я очень, очень больна. Я часто думаю о том, что умру, но все бы мне не хотелось так умереть, – в здешней земле лежать. Может быть, я опять слягу в постель, как и тогда, весной, а я еще оправиться не успела. Вот и теперь мне очень тяжело. Федора сегодня ушла куда-то на целый день, и я сижу одна. А с некоторого времени я боюсь оставаться одной; мне все кажется, что со мной в комнате кто-то бывает другой, что кто-то со мной говорит; особенно когда я об чем-нибудь задумаюсь и вдруг очнусь от задумчивости, так что мне страшно становится. Вот почему я вам такое большое письмо написала; когда я пишу, это проходит. Прощайте: кончаю письмо, потому что и бумаги и времени нет. Из вырученных денег за платья мои да за шляпку остался у меня только рубль серебром. Вы дали хозяйке два рубля серебром; это очень хорошо; она замолчит теперь на время.","So I burst into tears now, like a child, carried away by my memories. I recalled everything so vividly, so vividly, all the past became so bright before me, but the present is so dim, so dark!.. How will it end, how will it all end? You know, I have some conviction, some certainty, that I will die this autumn. I am very, very sick. I often think that I will die, but I would not like to die like that, to lie in this land. Maybe I’ll go to bed again, as I did then, in the spring, but I haven’t had time to recover yet. And now it's very hard for me. Fedora has gone somewhere for the whole day today, and I am sitting alone. And for some time I have been afraid to be alone; it always seems to me that someone else is in the room with me, that someone is talking to me; especially when I think about something and suddenly wake up from my reverie, so that I get scared. That is why I wrote you such a long letter; when I write it goes away. Farewell: I am finishing the letter, because there is no paper and no time. Of the money I received for my dresses and my hat, I only had a ruble in silver. You gave the hostess two silver rubles; this is very good; she will be silent now for a while.","Carried away by these memories, I could weep like a child. Everything, everything comes back so clearly to my recollection! The past stands out so vividly before me! Yet in the present everything looks dim and dark! How will it all end?—how? Do you know, I have a feeling, a sort of sure premonition, that I am going to die this coming autumn; for I feel terribly, oh so terribly ill! Often do I think of death, yet feel that I should not like to die here and be laid to rest in the soil of St. Petersburg. Once more I have had to take to my bed, as I did last spring, for I have never really recovered. Indeed I feel so depressed! Thedora has gone out for the day, and I am alone. For a long while past I have been afraid to be left by myself, for I keep fancying that there is someone else in the room, and that that someone is speaking to me. Especially do I fancy this when I have gone off into a reverie, and then suddenly awoken from it, and am feeling bewildered. That is why I have made this letter such a long one; for, when I am writing, the mood passes away. Goodbye. I have neither time nor paper left for more, and must close. Of the money which I saved to buy a new dress and hat, there remains but a single rouble; but, I am glad that you have been able to pay your landlady two roubles, for they will keep her tongue quiet for a time.","Now I have begun to cry like a child, carried away in my memories. I remember it all so vividly, so vividly, all my past stands so clearly before me, and the present seems so lustreless, so gloomy! … How will this end, how will it all end? You know, I have a sort of conviction, a kind of certainty that I shall die this autumn. I am very, very ill. I often think about dying, but even so I don’t want to die like this, and be buried here. It may be that I shall have to take to my bed again, as I did back in the spring, though I have still not recovered. Even now I feel very heavy of heart. Fedora has gone off somewhere for the whole day, and I am here alone. For some time now, however, I have been afraid to be left on my own; I keep imagining that there is someone else in the room with me, that someone is talking to me; especially when I start to muse about something and suddenly snap out of my musing, in such a way that I grow afraid. That is why I have written you such a long letter; when I write, that feeling passes. Goodbye: I shall finish now, because I have no more paper nor time. Of the money I got from pawning my dresses and my hat I have only a ruble in silver left. You have given your landlady two rubles in silver; that is fine, now she will keep quiet for a bit.","Here I am crying like a child, carried away by my reminiscences. I remembered it all so vividly, so vividly, all the past stood out so brightly before me, and the present is so dim, so dark! ... How will it end, how will it all end? Do you know I have a sort of conviction, a feeling of certainty, that I shall die this autumn. I am very, very ill. I often think about dying, but still I don’t want to die like this, to lie in the earth here. Perhaps I shall be laid up as I was in the spring; I’ve not fully recovered from that illness yet. I am feeling very dreary just now. Fedora has gone off somewhere for the whole day and I am sitting alone. And for some time now I’ve been afraid of being left alone; I always feel as though there were someone else in the room, that someone is talking to me; especially when I begin dreaming about something and suddenly wake up from my brooding, then I feel frightened. That is why I’ve written you such a long letter; it goes off when I write. Good-bye; I finish my letter because I have neither time nor paper for more. Of the money from pawning my dress and my hat I have only one rouble in silver left. You have given the landlady two roubles in silver; that’s very good. She will keep quiet now for a time."

"В следующий вечер, когда в доме уж все улеглись, Покровский отворил свою дверь и начал со мной разговаривать, стоя у порога своей комнаты. Я не помню теперь ни одного слова из того, что мы сказали тогда друг другу; помню только, что я робела, мешалась, досадовала на себя и с нетерпением ожидала окончания разговора, хотя сама всеми силами желала его, целый день мечтала о нем и сочиняла мои вопросы и ответы… С этого вечера началась первая завязка нашей дружбы. Во все продолжение болезни матушки мы каждую ночь по нескольку часов проводили вместе. Я мало-помалу победила свою застенчивость, хотя после каждого разговора нашего все еще было за что на себя подосадовать. Впрочем, я с тайною радостию и с гордым удовольствием видела, что он из-за меня забывал свои несносные книги. Случайно, в шутку, разговор зашел раз о падении их с полки. Минута была странная, я как-то слишком была откровенна и чистосердечна; горячность, странная восторженность увлекли меня, и я призналась ему во всем… в том, что мне хотелось учиться, что-нибудь знать, что мне досадно было, что меня считают девочкой, ребенком… Повторяю, что я была в престранном расположении духа; сердце мое было мягко, в глазах стояли слезы – я не утаила ничего и рассказала все, все – про мою дружбу к нему, про желание любить его, жить с ним заодно сердцем, утешить его, успокоить его. Он посмотрел на меня как-то странно, с замешательством, с изумлением и не сказал мне ни слова. Мне стало вдруг ужасно больно, грустно. Мне показалось, что он меня не понимает, что он, может быть, надо мною смеется. Я заплакала вдруг, как дитя, зарыдала, сама себя удержать не могла; точно я была в каком-то припадке. Он схватил мои руки, целовал их, прижимал к груди своей, уговаривал, утешал меня; он был сильно тронут; не помню, что он мне говорил, но только я и плакала, и смеялась, и опять плакала, краснела, не могла слова вымолвить от радости. Впрочем, несмотря на волнение мое, я заметила, что в Покровском все-таки оставалось какое-то смущение и принуждение. Кажется, он не мог надивиться моему увлечению, моему восторгу, такой внезапной, горячей, пламенной дружбе. Может быть, ему было только любопытно сначала; впоследствии нерешительность его исчезла, и он, с таким же простым, прямым чувством, как и я, принимал мою привязанность к нему, мои приветливые слова, мое внимание и отвечал на все это тем же вниманием, так же дружелюбно и приветливо, как искренний друг мой, как родной брат мой. Моему сердцу было так тепло, так хорошо!.. Я не скрывалась, не таилась ни в чем; он все это видел и с каждым днем все более и более привязывался ко мне.","The next evening, when everyone in the house had already settled down, Pokrovsky opened his door and began talking to me, standing at the threshold of his room. I don't remember now a single word of what we said to each other then; I only remember that I was shy, interfered, annoyed with myself and looked forward to the end of the conversation, although I myself wished it with all my might, dreamed about it all day and composed my questions and answers ... From that evening began the first beginning of our friendship. Throughout my mother's illness, we spent several hours every night together. Little by little I conquered my shyness, although after every conversation we had, there was still something to be annoyed with. However, I saw with secret joy and proud pleasure that he forgot his unbearable books because of me. By chance, as a joke, the conversation once turned on their fall from the shelf. The moment was strange, I was somehow too frank and sincere; ardor, a strange enthusiasm carried me away, and I confessed everything to him ... that I wanted to study, to know something, that I was annoyed that they considered me a girl, a child ... I repeat that I was in a strange mood; my heart was soft, there were tears in my eyes - I did not hide anything and told everything, everything - about my friendship for him, about the desire to love him, to live with him at the same time in my heart, to console him, to calm him. He looked at me somehow strangely, with confusion, with amazement, and did not say a word to me. I suddenly felt terribly sick, sad. It seemed to me that he did not understand me, that he might be laughing at me. I suddenly burst into tears, like a child, I sobbed, I could not restrain myself; I was definitely in some sort of a fit. He grabbed my hands, kissed them, pressed them to his chest, persuaded, consoled me; he was greatly moved; I don’t remember what he said to me, but only I wept, and laughed, and wept again, blushed, could not utter a word for joy. However, despite my excitement, I noticed that in Pokrovsky there still remained some kind of embarrassment and compulsion. It seems that he could not be surprised at my enthusiasm, my delight, such a sudden, hot, fiery friendship. Maybe he was only curious at first; afterwards his indecisiveness disappeared, and he, with the same simple, direct feeling as I, accepted my affection for him, my friendly words, my attention, and responded to all this with the same attention, as friendly and affable as a sincere friend. mine like my own brother. My heart was so warm, so good! .. I did not hide, did not hide in anything; he saw all this and became more and more attached to me every day.","That evening, when everyone else in the house had retired to rest, Pokrovski opened his door, and opened a conversation from the threshold of his room. Although, at this distance of time, I cannot remember a word of what we said to one another, I remember that I blushed, grew confused, felt vexed with myself, and awaited with impatience the end of the conversation although I myself had been longing for the meeting to take place, and had spent the day in dreaming of it, and devising a string of suitable questions and replies. Yes, that evening saw the first strand in our friendship knitted; and each subsequent night of my mother’s illness we spent several hours together. Little by little I overcame his reserve, but found that each of these conversations left me filled with a sense of vexation at myself. At the same time, I could see with secret joy and a sense of proud elation that I was leading him to forget his tiresome books. At last the conversation turned jestingly upon the upsetting of the shelf. The moment was a peculiar one, for it came upon me just when I was in the right mood for self-revelation and candour. In my ardour, my curious phase of exaltation, I found myself led to make a full confession of the fact that I had become wishful to learn, to KNOW, something, since I had felt hurt at being taken for a chit, a mere baby.... I repeat that that night I was in a very strange frame of mind. My heart was inclined to be tender, and there were tears standing in my eyes. Nothing did I conceal as I told him about my friendship for him, about my desire to love him, about my scheme for living in sympathy with him and comforting him, and making his life easier. In return he threw me a look of confusion mingled with astonishment, and said nothing. Then suddenly I began to feel terribly pained and disappointed, for I conceived that he had failed to understand me, or even that he might be laughing at me. Bursting into tears like a child, I sobbed, and could not stop myself, for I had fallen into a kind of fit; whereupon he seized my hand, kissed it, and clasped it to his breast—saying various things, meanwhile, to comfort me, for he was labouring under a strong emotion. Exactly what he said I do not remember—I merely wept and laughed by turns, and blushed, and found myself unable to speak a word for joy. Yet, for all my agitation, I noticed that about him there still lingered an air of constraint and uneasiness. Evidently, he was lost in wonder at my enthusiasm and raptures—at my curiously ardent, unexpected, consuming friendship. It may be that at first he was amazed, but that afterwards he accepted my devotion and words of invitation and expressions of interest with the same simple frankness as I had offered them, and responded to them with an interest, a friendliness, a devotion equal to my own, even as a friend or a brother would do. How happy, how warm was the feeling in my heart! Nothing had I concealed or repressed. No, I had bared all to his sight, and each day would see him draw nearer to me.","Next evening, when everyone in the house had gone to bed, Pokrovsky opened his door and began to talk to me, standing on the threshold of his room. I do not remember now a single word of what we said to each other; all I remember is that I was shy and confused, that I was annoyed with myself and awaited the end of our conversation with impatience, even though I had desired it with all my heart, had spent the whole day dreaming about it and preparing my questions and replies… The beginnings of our friendship dated from that evening. Throughout the entire duration of Mother’s illness we spent several hours of every night in each other’s company. Little by little I overcame my shyness, although after each of our conversations I would always find something to be annoyed with myself about. However that may have been, I none the less saw with secret delight and proud satisfaction that he was forgetting his wretched books because of me. Quite casually, almost in jest, our conversation once touched on the subject of their fall from the shelf. It was a strange moment – I was almost too open and candid; the heat of the moment and a strange enthusiasm carried me away, and I confessed everything to him… that I wanted to study, to know a few things , that I found it annoying to be regarded as a little girl, a child… I repeat that I was in a very strange mood; my heart was soft, there were tears in my eyes – I hid nothing and told him everything, everything – about my feelings of friendship for him, about my desire to live with him united in love, to console him, to calm him. He gave me a strange look which contained both embarrassment and amazement, and did not say a word. I suddenly felt terribly hurt and sad. It seemed to me that he did not understand me, that he might even be laughing at me. I suddenly started to cry like a child, sobbing, unable to control myself; it was as though I had succumbed to a kind of fit. He seized my hands, kissed them, held them to his breast, tried to reassure me, to console me; he was deeply moved. I do not remember what he said to me, only that I both wept and laughed, and once more wept, blushed, and was unable to utter a word for joy. Yet for all my emotional turmoil, I observed that Pokrovsky was still tense and embarrassed. He seemed to be unable to stop wondering at my animation, my enthusiasm, my so suddenly manifested, warm, ardent feelings of affection for him. Perhaps initially he had been merely curious; subsequently his lack of resolve disappeared, and he accepted, with the same simple directness as I, my attachment to him, my friendly words and my attention, and responded to it all with the same degree of attention, as kindly and amicably as if he were my sincere friend, my own brother. My heart felt so warm, so good!… I made no attempt to conceal my feelings from him, I kept nothing back; he saw it all, and with every day that passed became more attached to me.","The next evening, when everyone in the house had gone to bed, Pokrovsky opened his door and began talking to me, standing in the doorway of his room. I do not remember now a single word of what we said to one another; I only remember that I was shy, confused, vexed with myself and looked forward impatiently to the end of the conversation, though I had been desiring it intensely, dreaming of it all day, and making up my questions and answers.... The first stage of our friendship began from that evening. All through mother’s illness we spent several hours together every night. I got over my shyness by degrees, though after every conversation I found something in it to be vexed with myself about. Yet with secret joy and proud satisfaction I saw that for my sake he was beginning to forget his insufferable books. By chance the conversation once turned in jest on his books having fallen off the shelf. It was a strange moment. I was, as it were, too open and candid. I was carried away by excitement and a strange enthusiasm, and I confessed everything to him.... Confessed that I longed to study, to know something, that it vexed me to be considered a little girl.... I repeat that I was in a very strange mood; my heart was soft, there were tears in my eyes— I concealed nothing and told him everything—everything—my affection for him, my desire to love him, to live with him, to comfort him, to console him. He looked at me somewhat strangely, with hesitation and perplexity, and did not say one word. I felt all at once horribly sore and miserable. It seemed to me that he did not understand me, that perhaps he was laughing at me. I suddenly burst out crying like a child , I could not restrain myself, and sobbed as though I were in a sort of fit. He took my hands, kissed them and pressed them to his heart; talked to me, comforted me; he was much touched. I do not remember what he said to me, only I kept on crying and laughing and crying again, blushing, and so joyful that I could not utter a word. In spite of my emotion, I noticed, however, that Pokrovsky still showed traces of embarrassment and constraint. It seemed as though he were overwhelmed with wonder at my enthusiasm, my delight, my sudden warm, ardent affection. Perhaps it only seemed strange to him at first; later on his hesitation vanished and he accepted my devotion to him, my friendly words, my attentions, with the same simple, direct feeling that I showed, and responded to it all with the same attentiveness, as affectionately and warmly as a sincere friend, a true brother. My heart felt so warm, so happy ... I was not reserved, I concealed nothing from him, he saw it all and grew every day more and more attached to me."
"P. S. Горе-то мое, Варенька, хотел я вам описать пополам с шуточкой, только, видно, она не дается мне, шуточка-то. Вам хотелось угодить. Я к вам зайду, маточка, непременно зайду, завтра зайду.","P.S. My grief, Varenka, I wanted to describe to you in half with a joke, only, apparently, it is not given to me, a joke. You wanted to please. I will come to you, mother, I will certainly come, I will come tomorrow.","P.S.—To conceal my sorrow I would have written this letter half jestingly; but, the faculty of jesting has not been given me. My one desire, however, is to afford you pleasure. Soon I will come and see you, dearest. Without fail I will come and see you.","M. DEVUSHKIN PS My intention, Varenka, was to describe my troubles from a humorous point of view, but I evidently don’t have the knack of it, humour, I mean. I shall come and see you, little mother, without fail, I shall come tomorrow.","M. DYEVUSHKIN. P.S.—I meant to describe my troubles half in joke, Varinka, only it seems that it does not come off with me, joking. I wanted to satisfy you. I am coming to see you, my dear girl, I will be sure to come."
"Полно кручиниться! Как же это не стыдно вам! Ну полноте, ангельчик мой; как это вам такие мысли приходят? Вы не больны, душечка, вовсе не больны; вы цветете, право цветете; бледненьки немножко, а все-таки цветете. И что это у вас за сны да за видения такие! Стыдно, голубчик мой, полноте; вы плюньте на сны-то эти, просто плюньте. Отчего же я сплю хорошо? Отчего же мне ничего не делается? Вы посмотрите-ка на меня, маточка. Живу себе, сплю покойно, здоровехонек, молодец молодцом, любо смотреть. Полноте, полноте, душечка, стыдно. Исправьтесь. Я ведь головку-то вашу знаю, маточка, чуть что-нибудь найдет, вы уж и пошли мечтать да тосковать о чем-то. Ради меня перестаньте, душенька. В люди идти? – никогда! Нет, нет и нет! Да и что это вам думается такое, что это находит на вас? Да еще и на выезд! Да нет же, маточка, не позволю, вооружаюсь всеми силами против такого намерения. Мой фрак старый продам и в одной рубашке стану ходить по улицам, а уж вы у нас нуждаться не будете. Нет, Варенька, нет; уж я знаю вас! Это блажь, чистая блажь! А что верно, так это то, что во всем Федора одна виновата: она, видно, глупая баба, вас на все надоумила. А вы ей, маточка, не верьте. Да вы еще, верно, не знаете всего-то, душенька?.. Она баба глупая, сварливая, вздорная; она и мужа своего покойника со свету выжила. Или она, верно, вас рассердила там как-нибудь? Нет, нет, маточка, ни за что! И я-то как же буду тогда, что мне-то останется делать? Нет, Варенька, душенька, вы это из головки-то выкиньте. Чего вам недостает у нас? Мы на вас не нарадуемся, вы нас любите, – так и живите себе там смирненько; шейте или читайте, а пожалуй, и не шейте, – все равно, только с нами живите. А то вы сами посудите, ну на что это будет похоже тогда?.. Вот я вам книжек достану, а потом, пожалуй, и опять куда-нибудь гулять соберемся. Только вы-то полноте, маточка, полноте, наберитесь ума и из пустяков не блажите! Я к вам приду, и в весьма скором времени, только вы за это мое прямое и откровенное признание примите: нехорошо, душенька, очень нехорошо! Я, конечно, неученый человек и сам знаю, что неученый, что на медные деньги учился, да я не к тому и речь клоню, не во мне тут и дело-то, а за Ратазяева заступлюсь, воля ваша. Он мне друг, потому я за него и заступлюсь. Он хорошо пишет, очень, очень и опять-таки очень хорошо пишет. Не соглашаюсь я с вами и никак не могу согласиться. Писано цветисто, отрывисто, с фигурами, разные мысли есть; очень хорошо! Вы, может быть, без чувства читали, Варенька, или не в духе были, когда читали, на Федору за что-нибудь рассердились, или что-нибудь у вас там нехорошее вышло. Нет, вы прочтите-ка это с чувством, получше, когда вы довольны и веселы и в расположении духа приятном находитесь, вот, например, когда конфетку во рту держите – вот когда прочтите. Я не спорю (кто же против этого), есть и лучше Ратазяева писатели, есть даже и очень лучшие, но и они хороши и Ратазяев хорош; они хорошо пишут, и он хорошо пишет. Он себе особо, он так себе пописывает, и очень хорошо делает, что пописывает. Ну, прощайте, маточка; писать более не могу; нужно спешить, дело есть. Смотрите же, маточка, ясочка ненаглядная, успокойтесь, и господь да пребудет с вами, а я пребываю","Fully twist! How shameful you are! Well, come on, my angel; How do you get such thoughts? You are not sick, my dear, you are not sick at all; you bloom, right bloom; a little pale, but still blooming. And what kind of dreams and visions are you having! It's a shame, my dear, fullness; you spit on these dreams, just spit. Why do I sleep well? Why is nothing being done to me? Look at me, mother. I live for myself, I sleep peacefully, I'm healthy, well done, well done, it's a pleasure to watch. Fullness, fullness, darling, ashamed. Get better. After all, I know your head, mother, if you find something, you already went to dream and yearn for something. Stop it for me, my dear. Go to people? - never! No, no and NO! And what do you think it is, what does it come upon you? Yes, even out! No, mother, I won’t allow it, I arm myself with all my might against such an intention. I’ll sell my old tailcoat and I’ll walk the streets in one shirt, and you won’t need us. No, Varenka, no; I already know you! This is bullshit, pure bullshit! And what is true is that Fedor alone is to blame for everything: she, apparently, is a stupid woman, she has advised you on everything. And you, mother, do not believe her. Yes, you still don’t know everything, darling, don’t you? She is a stupid, quarrelsome, absurd woman; she and the husband of her deceased survived from the light. Or did she irritate you in some way? No, no, mother, no way! And then how will I be, what will I have to do? No, Varenka, darling, get that out of your head. What are you missing from us? We do not get enough of you, you love us, so live yourselves there humbly; sew or read, and perhaps don’t sew, it doesn’t matter, just live with us. Otherwise, you can judge for yourself, well, what will it look like then? .. So I'll get you some books, and then, perhaps, we'll get together to go for a walk somewhere again. Only you, completeness, mother, completeness, gain your mind and do not bless from trifles! I will come to you, and in a very short time, only you will accept my direct and frank confession for this: it’s not good, darling, very bad! Of course, I am an unlearned person and I myself know that I am an unlearned person, that I studied with copper money, but I’m not talking about that, it’s not about me here, but I’ll intercede for Ratazyaev, your will. He is my friend, so I will stand up for him. He writes well, very, very, and again very well. I do not agree with you and cannot agree at all. The writing is flowery, jerky, with figures, there are different thoughts; very good! Perhaps you read without feeling, Varenka, or you were not in a good mood when you read it, you got angry with Fyodor for something, or something bad happened to you there. No, you read it with a feeling, better, when you are happy and cheerful and in a pleasant mood, for example, when you hold candy in your mouth - that's when you read it. I do not argue (who is against this), there are writers better than Ratazyaev, there are even very best ones, but they are good and Ratazyaev is good; they write well and he writes well. He is special to himself, he pees so-so, and he is very good at pissing. Well, goodbye, mother; I can no longer write; you need to hurry, there is work. Look, mother, beloved ya, calm down, and may the Lord be with you, and I remain","Away with melancholy! Really, beloved, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! How can you allow such thoughts to enter your head? Really and truly you are quite well; really and truly you are, my darling. Why, you are blooming—simply blooming. True, I see a certain touch of pallor in your face, but still you are blooming. A fig for dreams and visions! Yes, for shame, dearest! Drive away those fancies; try to despise them. Why do I sleep so well? Why am I never ailing? Look at ME, beloved. I live well , I sleep peacefully, I retain my health, I can ruffle it with my juniors. In fact, it is a pleasure to see me. Come, come, then, sweetheart! Let us have no more of this. I know that that little head of yours is capable of any fancy—that all too easily you take to dreaming and repining; but for my sake, cease to do so. Are you to go to these people, you ask me? Never! No, no, again no! How could you think of doing such a thing as taking a journey? I will not allow it—I intend to combat your intention with all my might. I will sell my frockcoat, and walk the streets in my shirt sleeves, rather than let you be in want. But no, Barbara. I know you, I know you. This is merely a trick, merely a trick. And probably Thedora alone is to blame for it. She appears to be a foolish old woman, and to be able to persuade you to do anything. Do not believe her, my dearest. I am sure that you know what is what, as well as SHE does. Eh, sweetheart? She is a stupid, quarrelsome, rubbish-talking old woman who brought her late husband to the grave. Probably she has been plaguing you as much as she did him. No, no, dearest; you must not take this step. What should I do then? What would there be left for ME to do? Pray put the idea out of your head. What is it you lack here? I cannot feel sufficiently overjoyed to be near you, while, for your part, you love me well, and can live your life here as quietly as you wish. Read or sew, whichever you like—or read and do not sew. Only, do not desert me. Try, yourself, to imagine how things would seem after you had gone. Here am I sending you books, and later we will go for a walk. Come, come, then, my Barbara! Summon to your aid your reason, and cease to babble of trifles. As soon as I can I will come and see you, and then you shall tell me the whole story. This will not do, sweetheart; this certainly will not do. Of course, I know that I am not an educated man, and have received but a sorry schooling, and have had no inclination for it, and think too much of Rataziaev, if you will; but he is my friend, and therefore, I must put in a word or two for him. Yes, he is a splendid writer. Again and again I assert that he writes magnificently. I do not agree with you about his works, and never shall. He writes too ornately, too laconically, with too great a wealth of imagery and imagination. Perhaps you have read him without insight, Barbara? Or perhaps you were out of spirits at the time, or angry with Thedora about something, or worried about some mischance? Ah, but you should read him sympathetically, and, best of all, at a time when you are feeling happy and contented and pleasantly disposed—for instance, when you have a bonbon or two in your mouth. Yes, that is the way to read Rataziaev. I do not dispute (indeed, who would do so?) that better writers than he exist—even far better; but they are good, and he is good too —they write well, and he writes well. It is chiefly for his own sake that he writes, and he is to be approved for so doing. Now goodbye, dearest. More I cannot write, for I must hurry away to business. Be of good cheer, and the Lord God watch over you!—Your faithful friend,","Enough of this misery! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Enough, my little angel; how is it that such thoughts come into your head? You are not ill, my darling, you are not in the slightest ill; you are blossoming, positively blossoming; a little pale, perhaps, but blossoming all the same. And what are these dreams and visions of yours? Shame on you, my little dove – enough! You must spit in the face of those dreams, yes, spit in their face. Why do you suppose I sleep well? Why do you suppose that nothing bad happens to me? You ought to look at me, little mother. I take care of myself, sleep well , am in good health, a fine figure of a man, a pleasure to look at. Enough, little darling, enough – shame on you. You must mend your ways. After all, I know how that head of yours works, little mother – as soon as the slightest thing goes wrong you start dreaming and pining. Stop it for my sake, darling. Go into service? Never! No, no and no! What can you be thinking of, whatever has got into you? And in the country, too! Oh no, little mother, I shall not permit it. I shall exert every power at my disposal in order to oppose such a plan. I will sell my old jacket and go about the streets in my shirtsleeves rather than have you want for anything. No, Varenka, no; I know you! This is folly, pure folly! And if there is one thing that’s certain, it is that Fedora bears the sole responsibility: she is quite clearly a stupid peasant woman, and it is she who has put you up to all this. Don’t you believe a word she says, little mother. You don’t know much about her, do you, my darling?… She’s a stupid peasant woman, foolish and quarrelsome; she drove her husband into his grave. Or has she been making you lose your temper with her over there? No, no, little mother, not for anything in the world! What would happen to me if you went, what would be left for me? No, Varenka, darling, you must get this idea out of your little head. What do you lack with us? We dote upon you, you are fond ofus – sogo on living over there in your quiet way; sew or read, or, if you wish, don’t sew – it’s all the same, just as long as you go on living with us. Just think for yourself what life would be like here without you!… Look, I shall get some books for you, and then perhaps we’ll go and take another walk somewhere together. Only enough, enough, little mother : learn some sense and don’t be put off your balance by silly nonsense! I will come and visit you, and in a very short time, too; only in return you must accept my frank and honest opinion : you are wrong, my darling, you are very wrong! I, of course, am an uneducated man and know that I am uneducated, that I was brought up on a shoestring; but that is not what I am driving at, for it is not I who am at issue here, but Ratazyayev, whose side I shall take, say what you will. he is my friend, and so I take his part. He writes well, he writes very, very, very well. I do not agree with you, and there is no way in which I can agree with you. He writes floridly, in gusts, with figures of speech and all sorts of ideas; it’s very fine! I think, Varenka, you must have read it without feeling, or perhaps you weren’t in the right mood, you were angry with Fedora about something, or something unpleasant had happened over there. No, you read it again with feeling, preferably when you’re happy and content and in a good mood, as when, for example, you have a sweet in your mouth – that’s the time you should read it. I don’t deny (and who would?) that there are writers who are better, even much better than Ratazyayev, but they have their good points, and so does Ratazyayev; they write well, and so does he. he is a law unto himself, he writes in his own way, and what he writes he writes very well. Well, goodbye; I can write no more; I must make haste, for duty calls. See to it now, little mother, beloved little darling, compose yourself, may the Lord be with you, and I remain","Leave off worrying yourself, I wonder you are not ashamed. Come, give over, my angel! How is it such thoughts come into your mind?You are not ill, my love, you are not ill at all; you are blooming, you are really blooming; a little pale, but still blooming. And what do you mean by these dreams, these visions? For shame, my darling, give over; you must simply laugh at them. Why do I sleep well? Why is nothing wrong with me? You should look at me, my dear soul. I get along all right , I sleep quietly, I am as healthy and hearty as can be, a treat to look at. Give over, give over, darling, for shame. You must reform. I know your little ways, my dearie; as soon as any . trouble comes, you begin fancying things and worrying about something. For my sake give over, my darling. Go into a family?—Never! No, no, no, and what notion is this of yours? What is this idea that has come over you? And to leave Petersburg too. No, my darling, I won’t allow it. I will use every means in my power to oppose such a plan. I’ll sell my old coat and walk about the street in my shirt before you shall want for anything. No, Varinka, no, I know you! It’s folly, pure folly. And there is no doubt that it is all Fedora’s fault : she’s evidently a stupid woman, she puts all these ideas into your head. Don’t you trust her, my dear girl. You probably don’t know everything yet, my love.... She’s a silly woman, discontented and nonsensical; she worried her husband out of his life. Or perhaps she has vexed you in some way? No, no, my precious, not for anything! And what would become of me then, what would there be left for me to do? No, Varinka darling, you put that out of your little head. What is there wanting in your life with us? We can never rejoice enough over you, you love us, so do go on living here quietly. Sew or read, or don’t sew if you like —it does not matter—only go on living with us or, only think yourself, why, what would it be like without you? ... Here, I will get you some books and then maybe we’ll go for a walk somewhere again. Only you must give over, my dearie, you must give over. Pull yourself together and don’t be foolish over trifles! I’ll come and see you and very soon too. Only accept what I tell you plainly and candidly about it; you are wrong, my darling, very wrong. Of course, I am an ignorant man and I know myself that I am ignorant, that I have hardly a ha’porth of education. But that’s not what I am talking about, and I’m not what matters, but I will stand up for Ratazyaev, say what you like. He writes well, very, very well, and I say it again, he writes very well. I don’t agree with you and I never can agree with you. It’s written in a flowery abrupt style, with figures of speech. There are ideas of all sorts in it, it is very good! Perhaps you read it without feeling, Varinka; you were out of humour when you read it, vexed with Fedora, or something had gone wrong. No, you read it with feeling; best when you are pleased and happy and in a pleasant humour, when, for instance, you have got a sweetmeat in your mouth, that’s when you must read it. I don’t dispute (who denies it?) that there are better writers than Ratazyaev, and very much better in fact, but they are good and Ratazyaev is good too. He writes in his own special way, and does very well to write. Well, good-bye, my precious, I can’t write more; I must make haste, I have work to do. Mind now, my love, my precious little dearie; calm yourself, and God will be with you, and I remain your faithful friend,"
"Начну с того, что было мне всего семнадцать годочков, когда я на службу явился, и вот уже скоро тридцать лет стукнет моему служебному поприщу. Ну, ничего сказать, износил я вицмундиров довольно; возмужал, поумнел, людей посмотрел; пожил, могу сказать, что пожил на свете, так, что меня хотели даже раз к получению креста представить. Вы, может быть, не верите, а я вам, право, не лгу. Так что же, маточка, – нашлись на все это злые люди! А скажу я вам, родная моя, что я хоть и темный человек, глупый человек, пожалуй, но сердце-то у меня такое же, как и у другого кого. Так знаете ли, Варенька, что сделал мне злой человек? А срамно сказать, что он сделал; спросите – отчего сделал? А оттого, что я смирненький, а оттого, что я тихонький, а оттого, что добренький! Не пришелся им по нраву, так вот и пошло на меня. Сначала началось тем, что, «дескать, вы, Макар Алексеевич, того да сего»; а потом стало – «что, дескать, у Макара Алексеевича и не спрашивайте». А теперь заключили тем, что, «уж конечно, это Макар Алексеевич!» Вот, маточка, видите ли, как дело пошло: всё на Макара Алексеевича; они только и умели сделать, что в пословицу ввели Макара Алексеевича в целом ведомстве нашем. Да мало того, что из меня пословицу и чуть ли не бранное слово сделали, – до сапогов, до мундира, до волос, до фигуры моей добрались: все не по них, все переделать нужно! И ведь это все с незапамятных времен каждый божий день повторяется. Я привык, потому что я ко всему привыкаю, потому что я смирный человек, потому что я маленький человек; но, однако же, за что это все? Что я кому дурного сделал? Чин перехватил у кого-нибудь, что ли? Перед высшими кого-нибудь очернил? Награждение перепросил! Кабалу стряпал [6] , что ли, какую-нибудь? Да грех вам и подумать-то такое, маточка! Ну куда мне все это? Да вы только рассмотрите, родная моя, имею ли я способности, достаточные для коварства и честолюбия? Так за что же напасти такие на меня, прости господи? Ведь вы же находите меня человеком достойным, а вы не в пример лучше их всех, маточка. Ведь какая самая наибольшая гражданская добродетель? Отнеслись намедни в частном разговоре Евстафий Иванович, что наиважнейшая добродетель гражданская – деньгу уметь зашибить. Говорили они шуточкой (я знаю, что шуточкой), нравоучение же то, что не нужно быть никому в тягость собою, а я никому не в тягость! У меня кусок хлеба есть свой; правда, простой кусок хлеба, подчас даже черствый; но он есть, трудами добытый, законно и безукоризненно употребляемый. Ну что ж делать! Я ведь и сам знаю, что я немного делаю тем, что переписываю; да все-таки я этим горжусь: я работаю, я пот проливаю. Ну что ж тут в самом деле такого, что переписываю! Что, грех переписывать, что ли? «Он, дескать, переписывает!» «Эта, дескать, крыса-чиновник переписывает!» Да что же тут бесчестного такого? Письмо такое четкое, хорошее, приятно смотреть, и его превосходительство довольны; я для них самые важные бумаги переписываю. Ну, слогу нет, ведь я это сам знаю, что нет его, проклятого; вот потому-то я и службой не взял, и даже вот к вам теперь, родная моя, пишу спроста, без затей и так, как мне мысль на сердце ложится… Я это все знаю; да, однако же, если бы все сочинять стали, так кто же бы стал переписывать? Я вот какой вопрос делаю и вас прошу отвечать на него, маточка. Ну, так я и сознаю теперь, что я нужен, что я необходим и что нечего вздором человека с толку сбивать. Ну, пожалуй, пусть крыса, коли сходство нашли! Да крыса-то эта нужна, да крыса-то пользу приносит, да за крысу-то эту держатся, да крысе-то этой награждение выходит, – вот она крыса какая! Впрочем, довольно об этой материи, родная моя; я ведь и не о том хотел говорить, да так погорячился немного. Все-таки приятно от времени до времени себе справедливость воздать. Прощайте, родная моя, голубчик мой, утешительница вы моя добренькая! Зайду, непременно к вам зайду, проведаю вас, моя ясочка. А вы не скучайте покамест. Книжку вам принесу. Ну, прощайте же, Варенька.","To begin with, I was only seventeen years old when I came to the service, and soon thirty years will hit my service career. Well, nothing to say, I wore out my uniforms enough; matured, wiser, looked at people; I lived, I can say that I lived in the world, so that they even wanted to present me once before receiving the cross. You may not believe me, but I really am not lying to you. So, mother, there were evil people for all this! And I will tell you, my dear, that although I am a dark person, a stupid person, perhaps, my heart is the same as that of someone else. So do you know, Varenka, what the evil man did to me? And shameful to say what he did; ask why did you do it? And because I'm meek, but because I'm quiet, but because I'm kind! They didn't like it, so that's what happened to me. At first it began with the fact that, ""say, you, Makar Alekseevich, this and that""; and then it became - ""what, they say, don't ask Makar Alekseevich."" And now they concluded that, “of course, this is Makar Alekseevich!” Here, mother, you see how things went: everything is on Makar Alekseevich; they only knew how to do that Makar Alekseevich was introduced into the proverb in our whole department. Yes, not only did they make a proverb out of me and almost a swear word - they got to the boots, to the uniform, to the hair, to my figure: everything is not according to them, everything needs to be redone! And after all, this has been repeated every single day since time immemorial. I am used to it because I get used to everything, because I am a quiet person, because I am a small person; but, nevertheless, what is all this for? What have I done wrong to anyone? Chin intercepted from someone, or what? Did you denigrate anyone before the higher ones? Asked for an award! Did you cook the cabal [6], or something? Yes, it’s a sin for you to think something like that, mother! Well, where do I get all this? But just consider, my dear, do I have the abilities sufficient for deceit and ambition? So why attack such people on me, God forgive me? After all, you find me a worthy person, and you, by far, are better than all of them, mother. After all, what is the greatest civic virtue? The other day, in a private conversation, Evstafiy Ivanovich reacted that the most important civil virtue is to be able to make money. They said in jest (I know it was in jest), but the moralizing is that you don’t need to be a burden to anyone, but I’m not a burden to anyone! I have my own piece of bread; true, a simple piece of bread, sometimes even stale; but it is, obtained by labor, legally and irreproachably used. Well, what to do! I myself know that I do little by copying; but still I am proud of it: I work, I shed sweat. Well, what is it really such that I am rewriting! What, a sin to rewrite, or what? “He, they say, rewrites!” “This, they say, rat-official rewrites!” So what's so dishonest about it? The letter is so clear, good, pleasant to look at, and His Excellency is pleased; I rewrite the most important papers for them. Well, there is no syllable, because I myself know that there is no damned one; that’s why I didn’t even take the service, and even now, my dear, I’m writing to you simply, without fantasies and in the way that the thought falls on my heart ... I know all this; yes, however, if everyone began to compose, then who would begin to rewrite? This is the question I am asking and I ask you to answer it, mother. Well, that's how I realize now that I'm needed, that I'm needed, and that there's nothing to confuse a person with nonsense. Well, perhaps, let the rat, if they found a resemblance! Yes, this rat is needed, but this rat is useful, but this rat is held on to, and this rat is rewarded - what a rat it is! However, enough about this matter, my dear; I didn’t want to talk about that, but I got a little excited. Still, it's nice to do justice to yourself from time to time. Farewell, my dear, my dear, you are my kind comforter! I will come, I will certainly come to you, I will visit you, my yasochka. And don't be bored for now. I'll bring you a book. Well, goodbye, Varenka.","I will begin from the time when I was seventeen years old and first entered the service—though I shall soon have completed my thirtieth year of official activity. I may say that at first I was much pleased with my new uniform; and, as I grew older, I grew in mind, and fell to studying my fellow-men. Likewise I may say that I lived an upright life—so much so that at last I incurred persecution. This you may not believe, but it is true. To think that men so cruel should exist! For though, dearest one, I am dull and of no account, I have feelings like everyone else. Consequently, would you believe it, Barbara, when I tell you what these cruel fellows did to me? I feel ashamed to tell it you—and all because I was of a quiet, peaceful, good-natured disposition! Things began with “this or that, Makar Alexievitch, is your fault.” Then it went on to “I need hardly say that the fault is wholly Makar Alexievitch’s.” Finally it became “OF COURSE Makar Alexievitch is to blame.” Do you see the sequence of things, my darling? Every mistake was attributed to me, until “Makar Alexievitch” became a byword in our department. Also, while making of me a proverb, these fellows could not give me a smile or a civil word. They found fault with my boots, with my uniform, with my hair, with my figure. None of these things were to their taste: everything had to be changed. And so it has been from that day to this. True, I have now grown used to it, for I can grow accustomed to anything (being, as you know, a man of peaceable disposition, like all men of small stature)—yet why should these things be? Whom have I harmed? Whom have I ever supplanted? Whom have I ever traduced to his superiors? No, the fault is that more than once I have asked for an increase of salary. But have I ever CABALLED for it? No, you would be wrong in thinking so, my dearest one. HOW could I ever have done so? You yourself have had many opportunities of seeing how incapable I am of deceit or chicanery. Why then, should this have fallen to my lot?... However, since you think me worthy of respect, my darling, I do not care, for you are far and away the best person in the world.... What do you consider to be the greatest social virtue? In private conversation Evstafi Ivanovitch once told me that the greatest social virtue might be considered to be an ability to get money to spend. Also, my comrades used jestingly (yes, I know only jestingly) to propound the ethical maxim that a man ought never to let himself become a burden upon anyone. Well, I am a burden upon no one. It is my own crust of bread that I eat; and though that crust is but a poor one, and sometimes actually a maggoty one, it has at least been EARNED, and therefore, is being put to a right and lawful use. What therefore, ought I to do? I know that I can earn but little by my labours as a copyist; yet even of that little I am proud, for it has entailed WORK, and has wrung sweat from my brow. What harm is there in being a copyist? “He is only an amanuensis,” people say of me. But what is there so disgraceful in that? My writing is at least legible, neat, and pleasant to look upon—and his Excellency is satisfied with it. Indeed, I transcribe many important documents. At the same time, I know that my writing lacks STYLE, which is why I have never risen in the service. Even to you, my dear one, I write simply and without tricks, but just as a thought may happen to enter my head. Yes, I know all this; but if everyone were to become a fine writer, who would there be left to act as copyists?... Whatsoever questions I may put to you in my letters, dearest, I pray you to answer them. I am sure that you need me, that I can be of use to you; and, since that is so, I must not allow myself to be distracted by any trifle. Even if I be likened to a rat, I do not care, provided that that particular rat be wanted by you, and be of use in the world, and be retained in its position, and receive its reward. But what a rat it is! Enough of this, dearest one. I ought not to have spoken of it, but I lost my temper. Still, it is pleasant to speak the truth sometimes. Goodbye, my own, my darling, my sweet little comforter! I will come to you soon— yes, I will certainly come to you. Until I do so, do not fret yourself. With me I shall be bringing a book. Once more goodbye.—Your","I was only seventeen when I first went into the service – soon I will have spent more than thirty years in this walk of life. Well, indeed, I have worn out enough dress uniforms in my time; I have grown to man’s estate, acquired some shrewdness, and seen something of people; I have lived, and I can say that I have lived in the world, to the extent that once I was even nominated to receive a medal. Perhaps you will not believe me, but I assure you that this is so. And what became of it, little mother? Evil men brought it all to nothing. But I will tell you, my darling, that even though I may be an ignorant man, a stupid man, my heart is the same as anyone else’s. Do you know what an evil man did to me, Varenka? It is shameful to tell what he did – you will ask why he did it. He did it because I am a meek little soul, because I am a quiet, a good little soul! I did not appeal to his taste, and so he let fly at me. It began with him saying things to me like ‘You are this and that, Makar Alekseyevich’; then this turned into: ‘Oh, it is no good asking Makar Alekseyevich!’ And finally this became: ‘It’s all Makar Alekseyevich is fault, of course.’ You see, my darling, how it went; everything was laid at Makar Alekseyevich is door; the name of Makar Alekseyevich became a watchword throughout our entire department. And it was not enough that they made me into a watchword, into a term of abuse, almost – they latched on to my boots, my uniform, my hair, the shape of my body: none of these were to their liking, they must all be changed. And I mean, all this has been repeated every single day of the week since God knows when. I have grown accustomed to it, because I can grow accustomed to anything, because I am a meek man, because I am a little man; but, I ask, what is the reason for it all? What wrong have I ever done anyone? Have I stolen promotion from anyone? Have I ever slandered anyone to the higher-ups? Asked for a bonus I did not deserve? Made up tales? It would be unjust of you even to think of such a thing, little mother. Why would I ever do anything like that? Just look at me, my darling. Do I look as though I had a leaning for perfidy and ambition? So why have such disasters befallen me, in the name of God? After all, you consider me a worthy man, and you are immeasurably better than all of them, little mother. I mean, what is the greatest civic virtue? Yevstafy Ivanovich said the other day in a private conversation I had with him that the most important civic virtue is to know how to make a lot of money. He said, jokingly (I know he was joking), that moral education consists merely in learning how not to be a burden on anyone; and I’m not a burden on anyone! My crust of bread is my own; it’s true that it’s a plain crust of bread, at times even a dry one; but there it is, earned by my labours and consumed lawfully and unexceptionably. Well, what can one do? I mean, I know that the copying I do is not much of a job; yet, even so, I am proud of it: I work in the sweat of my brow. So what is wrong with the fact that I earn my living by copying? Is copying a sin? ‘ He just copies documents,’ they say. ‘That rat of a government clerk makes his living by copying!’ Yet what is dishonourable about it? My handwriting is clear, well-formed and pleasant to look at, and His Excellency is satisfied with it; I copy his most important documents for him. Of course, I have no literary style, I mean, I know I have none , curse it; that is why I have not succeeded in rising in the service, and why even now, my darling, I write to you in this plain manner, with no frills, just as the thoughts come into my heart… All this I know; and indeed, if everyone were to start being an author, who would do the copying? That is the question I ask you, and I beg you to answer it, little mother. Well, so now I am aware that I am necessary, that I am indispensable, and that a man is silly to be upset by non sense. All right, let me be a rat, since they’ve found a resemblance! But this rat is needed, this rat is of use, this rat is relied upon, and this rat receives a bonus – that’s the sort of rat it ’s! But enough of this subject, my darling; I did not really wish to speak of it, but got carried away a little in the heat of the moment. All the same, it is pleasant to do oneself justice from time to time. Goodbye, my darling, my little dove, my kind consoler! I will come and see you, I promise I will; I shall call on you, my treasure. And in the meantime, don’t pine. I shall bring you a book. Well, goodbye, Varenka.","I will begin with when I was only seventeen and went into the service, and soon the thirtieth year of my career there will be here. Well, I needn’t say I have worn out many a uniform; I grew to manhood and to good sense and saw something of the world; I have lived, I may say, I have lived in the world so that on one occasion they even wanted to send up my name to receive a cross. Maybe you will not believe me, but I am really not lying. But there, my darling, in spite of everything, I have been badly treated by malicious people! I tell you, my own, that though I am an obscure person, a stupid person, perhaps, yet I have my feelings like anyone else. Do you know, Varinka, what a spiteful man did to me? I am ashamed to say what he has done to me; you will ask why did he do it? Why, because I am meek, because I am quiet, because I am good-natured! I did not suit their taste, so that’s what brought it upon me. At first it began with, “You are this and that, Makar Alexyevitch,” and then it came to saying, “It’s no good asking Makar Alexyevitch!” And then it ended by, “ Of course, that is Makar Alexyevitch! ” You see, my precious, what a pass it came to; always Makar Alexyevitch to blame for everything; they managed to make Makar Alexyevitch a by-word all over the department, and it was not enough that they made me a by-word and almost a term of abuse , they attacked my boots, my uniform, my hair, my figure; nothing was to their taste, everything ought to be different! And all this has been repeated every blessed day from time immemorial. I am used to it, for I grow used to anything, because I am a meek man; but what is it all for? What harm do I do to anyone? Have I stolen promotion from anyone, or what? Have I blackened anyone’s reputation with his superiors? Have I asked for anything extra out of turn? Have I got up some intrigue? Why, it’s a sin for you to imagine such a thing, my dear soul! As though I could do anything of that sort! You’ve only to look at me, my own. Have I sufficient ability for intrigue and ambition? Then why have such misfortunes come upon me? God forgive me. Here you consider me a decent man, and you are ever so much better than any of them, my darling. Why, what is the greatest virtue in a citizen? A day or two ago, in private conversation, Yevstafy Ivanovitch said that the most important virtue in a citizen was to earn money. He said in jest (I know it was in jest) that morality consists in not being a burden to anyone. Well, I’m not a burden to anyone. My crust of bread is my own; it is true it is a plain crust of bread, at times a dry one; but there it is, earned by my toil and put to lawful and irreproachable use. Why, what can one do? I know very well, of course, that I don’t do much by copying; but all the same I am proud of working and earning my bread in the sweat of my brow. Why, what if I am a copying clerk, after all? What harm is there in copying, after all? “He’s a copying clerk,” they say, but what is there discreditable in that? My handwriting is good, distinct and pleasant to the eye, and his Excellency is satisfied with it. I have no gift of language, of course, I know myself that I haven’t the confounded thing; that’s why I have not got on in the service, and why even now, my own, I am writing to you simply, artlessly, just as the thought comes into my heart... I know all that; but there, if everyone became an author, who would do the copying? I ask you that question and I beg you to answer it, Varinka dear. So I see now that I am necessary, that I am indispensable, and that it’s no use to worry a man with nonsense. Well, let me be a rat if you like, since they see a resemblance! But the rat is necessary, but the rat is of service, but the rat is depended upon, but the rat is given a reward, so that’s the sort of rat he is! Enough about that subject though, my own! I did not intend to talk about that at all, but I got a little heated. Besides, it’s pleasant from time to time to do oneself justice. Good-bye, my own, my darling, my kind comforter! I will come, I will certainly come to see you, my dearie, and meanwhile, don’t be dull, I will bring you a book. Well, good-bye, then, Varinka."
"Нет, друг мой, нет, мне не житье между вами. Я раздумала и нашла, что очень дурно делаю, отказываясь от такого выгодного места. Там будет у меня по крайней мере хоть верный кусок хлеба; я буду стараться, я заслужу ласку чужих людей, даже постараюсь переменить свой характер, если будет надобно. Оно, конечно, больно и тяжело жить между чужими, искать чужой милости, скрываться и принуждать себя, да бог мне поможет. Не оставаться же век нелюдимкой. Со мною уж бывали такие же случаи. Я помню, когда я, бывало, еще маленькая, в пансион хаживала. Бывало, все воскресенье дома резвишься, прыгаешь, иной раз и побранит матушка, – все ничего, все хорошо на сердце, светло на душе. Станет подходить вечер, и грусть нападет смертельная, нужно в девять часов в пансион идти, а там все чужое, холодное, строгое, гувернантки по понедельникам такие сердитые, так и щемит, бывало, за душу, плакать хочется; пойдешь в уголок и поплачешь одна-одинешенька, слезы скрываешь, – скажут, ленивая; а я вовсе не о том и плачу, бывало, что учиться надобно. Ну, что ж? я привыкла, и потом, когда выходила из пансиона, так тоже плакала, прощаясь с подружками. Да и нехорошо я делаю, что живу в тягость обоим вам. Эта мысль – мне мученье. Я вам откровенно говорю все это, потому что привыкла быть с вами откровенною. Разве я не вижу, как Федора встает каждый день раным-ранехонько да за стирку свою принимается и до поздней ночи работает? – а старые кости любят покой. Разве я не вижу, что вы на меня разоряетесь, последнюю копейку ребром ставите да на меня ее тратите? не с вашим состоянием, мой друг! Пишете вы, что последнее продадите, а меня в нужде не оставите. Верю, друг мой, я верю в ваше доброе сердце, – но это вы теперь так говорите. Теперь у вас есть деньги неожиданные, вы получили награждение; но потом что будет, потом? Вы знаете сами – я больная всегда; я не могу так же, как и вы, работать, хотя бы душою рада была, да и работа не всегда бывает. Что же мне остается? Надрываться с тоски, глядя на вас обоих, сердечных. Чем я могу оказать вам хоть малейшую пользу? И отчего я вам так необходима, друг мой? Что я вам хорошего сделала? Я только привязана к вам всею душою, люблю вас крепко, сильно, всем сердцем, но – горька судьба моя! – я умею любить и могу любить, но только, а не творить добро, не платить вам за ваши благодеяния. Не держите же меня более, подумайте и скажите ваше последнее мнение. В ожидании пребываю","No, my friend, no, I can't live between you. I changed my mind and found that I was doing very badly, refusing such an advantageous place. There I will have at least a sure piece of bread; I will try, I will earn the affection of strangers, I will even try to change my character, if necessary. It is, of course, painful and hard to live among strangers, to seek someone else's mercy, to hide and force myself, God help me. Do not remain unsociable for a century. I have had the same cases. I remember when I used to go to boarding school when I was little. It used to be that all Sunday at home you frolicked, jumped, sometimes mother scolded - everything was fine, everything was good in the heart, light in the soul. Evening will begin to approach, and deadly sadness will attack, you need to go to the boarding school at nine o'clock, and there everything is alien, cold, strict, the governesses on Mondays are so angry, it hurts, it happened, for the soul, you want to cry; you go to a corner and cry all alone, you hide your tears, they will say you are lazy; but I’m not crying about that at all, it happened that it was necessary to study. Well? I got used to it, and then, when I left the boarding house, I also cried like that, saying goodbye to my girlfriends. Yes, and it’s not good that I’m doing that I live a burden to both of you. This thought is torment to me. I'm telling you all this frankly because I'm used to being frank with you. Don't I see how Fedora gets up early every day, very early, and does her laundry and works until late at night? – and old bones love peace. Don't I see that you are ruining yourself on me, betting your last kopeck point-blank and spending it on me? not with your condition, my friend! You write that you will sell the last, but you will not leave me in need. I believe, my friend, I believe in your good heart - but it is you who say so now. Now you have unexpected money, you have received an award; but then what will happen, then? You know yourself - I'm always sick; I can’t work like you, even if I’m glad in my soul, and work doesn’t always happen. What is left for me? Torn with anguish, looking at both of you, cordial. How can I be of any use to you? And why do you need me so much, my friend? What good have I done for you? I am only attached to you with all my soul, I love you strongly, strongly, with all my heart, but - my fate is bitter! - I know how to love and I can love, but only, and not to do good, not to pay you for your good deeds. Do not hold me any longer, think and tell me your last opinion. I am waiting","No, no, my friend, I must not go on living near you. I have been thinking the matter over, and come to the conclusion that I should be doing very wrong to refuse so good a post. I should at least have an assured crust of bread; I might at least set to work to earn my employers’ favour, and even try to change my character if required to do so. Of course it is a sad and sorry thing to have to live among strangers, and to be forced to seek their patronage, and to conceal and constrain one’s own personality—but God will help me. I must not remain forever a recluse, for similar chances have come my way before. I remember how, when a little girl at school, I used to go home on Sundays and spend the time in frisking and dancing about. Sometimes my mother would chide me for so doing, but I did not care, for my heart was too joyous, and my spirits too buoyant, for that. Yet as the evening of Sunday came on, a sadness as of death would overtake me, for at nine o’clock I had to return to school, where everything was cold and strange and severe—where the governesses, on Mondays, lost their tempers, and nipped my ears, and made me cry. On such occasions I would retire to a corner and weep alone; concealing my tears lest I should be called lazy. Yet it was not because I had to study that I used to weep, and in time I grew more used to things, and, after my schooldays were over, shed tears only when I was parting with friends... It is not right for me to live in dependence upon you. The thought tortures me. I tell you this frankly, for the reason that frankness with you has become a habit. Cannot I see that daily, at earliest dawn, Thedora rises to do washing and scrubbing, and remains working at it until late at night, even though her poor old bones must be aching for want of rest? Cannot I also see that YOU are ruining yourself for me, and hoarding your last kopeck that you may spend it on my behalf? You ought not so to act, my friend, even though you write that you would rather sell your all than let me want for anything. I believe in you, my friend—I entirely believe in your good heart; but, you say that to me now (when, perhaps, you have received some unexpected sum or gratuity) and there is still the future to be thought of. You yourself know that I am always ailing—that I cannot work as you do, glad though I should be of any work if I could get it; so what else is there for me to do? To sit and repine as I watch you and Thedora? But how would that be of any use to you? AM I necessary to you, comrade of mine? HAVE I ever done you any good? Though I am bound to you with my whole soul, and love you dearly and strongly and wholeheartedly, a bitter fate has ordained that that love should be all that I have to give—that I should be unable, by creating for you subsistence, to repay you for all your kindness. Do not, therefore, detain me longer, but think the matter out, and give me your opinion on it. In expectation of which I remain your sweetheart,","No, my friend, no, this is no life for me, here among you. I have given the matter some thought and have decided that it would be very wrong of me to refuse such an advantageous post. There I shall at least have my daily bread assured to me; I shall make an effort, I shall earn the good graces of people who are strangers to me , I shall even endeavour to alter my character, if need be. It is, of course, hard and hurtful to live among strangers, to seek their mercy, to hide one is feelings and constrain oneself, but God will help me. I must not remain a stay-at-home all my life. Similar things have happened to me in the past. I remember the days when I was a little girl and used to go to boarding-school. All Sunday I would play around at home, jumping and skipping; from time to time Mother would scold me, but I didn’t care – my heart was so full of happiness, my soul was so radiant. Evening would draw near, and then a mortal sadness would descend on me: at nine o’ clock I should have to return to my boarding-school, and there everything was cold, alien and strict, the schoolmistresses were so short-tempered on Mondays – my soul would fairly ache, and I would want to cry. I would go into a corner and weep all on my own, concealing my tears, as people would say I was lazy; yet the reason for my crying had nothing to do with the necessity of study. Well, in any case, I grew accustomed to the school, and then I would cry again when I had to leave it and say goodbye to my companions. I should be acting wrongly to go on being a burden to both of you. That thought is torture to me. I tell you all this frankly, because I am used to being frank with you. Do you think I don’t see the way Fedora gets up at the crack of dawn every morning to do her laundry and works until late at night? And old bones need rest, too. Do you think I don’t see the way you ruin yourself over me, spending your every last copeck on me? A man of your means, my friend! You write that you will sell the last of your belongings rather than leave me in hardship. I believe you, my friend, I believe in your good heart – but those are just words. Just now you have some money you did not expect to have , you have been paid a bonus; but what will happen later, what then? You know yourself that I am constantly ill; I cannot work as you do, even though I should be truly glad to – and then there is not always work to be found. What is left for me? To let my heart break from sorrow as I watch the two of you, kind souls that you are? How can I render you even the slightest service? And why am I so indispensable to you, my friend? What good have I ever done you? I am merely devoted to you with all my soul, I love you fiercely, strongly, with all my heart, but – O bitter fate!– am able only to love, and not to do good works, to pay you for your unselfishness. Do not try to hold me back any longer, think about what I have written and tell me your final opinion. I remain, in expectation,","No, my friend, no, I ought not to go on living among you. On second thoughts I consider that I am doing very wrong to refuse such a good situation. I shall have at least my daily bread secure; I will do my best, I will win the affection of the strangers, I will even try to overcome my defects, if necessary. Of course it is painful and irksome to live with strangers, to try and win their good-will, to hide one’s feelings, and suppress oneself, but Good will help me. I mustn’t be a recluse all my life. I have had experiences like it before. I remember when I was a little thing and used to go to school. I used to be frolicking and skipping about all Sundays at home; sometimes mother would scold me—but nothing mattered, my heart was light and my soul was full of joy all the while. As evening approached an immense sadness would come over me—at nine o’clock I had to go back to school, and there it was all cold, strange, severe, the teachers were so cross on Mondays, one had such a pain at one’s heart, one wanted to cry; one would go into a corner and cry all alone, hiding one’s tears —they would say one was lazy; and I wasn’t crying in the least because I had to do my lessons. But, after all, I got used to it, and when I had to leave school I cried also when I said good-bye to my schoolfellows. And I am not doing right to go on being a burden to both of you. That thought is a torment to me. I tell you all this openly because I am accustomed to be open with you. Do you suppose I don’t see how early Fedora gets up in the morning, and sets to work at her washing and works till late at night?—and old bones want rest. Do you suppose I don’t see how you are ruining yourself over me, and spending every halfpenny? You are not a man of property, my friend! You tell me that you will sell your last rag before I shall want for anything. I believe you, my friend, I trust your kind heart, but you say that now. Now you have money you did not expect, you’ve received something extra, but later on?You know yourself, I am always ill; and I can’t work like you, though I should be heartily glad to, and one does not always get work. What is left for me? To break my heart with grief looking at you two dear ones. In what way can I be of the slightest use to you? And why am I so necessary to you, my friend? What good have I done you? I am only devoted to you with my whole soul, I love you warmly, intensely, with my whole heart, but—my fate is a bitter one! I know how to love and I can love, but I can do nothing to repay you for your kindness. Don’t dissuade me any more, think it over and tell me your final opinion. Meanwhile I remain your loving,"
"Варвара Алексеевна! голубчик мой, маточка! Пропал я, пропали мы оба, оба вместе, безвозвратно пропали. Моя репутация, амбиция – все потеряно! Я погиб, и вы погибли, маточка, и вы, вместе со мной, безвозвратно погибли! Это я, я вас в погибель ввел! Меня гонят, маточка, презирают, на смех подымают, а хозяйка просто меня бранить стала; кричала, кричала на меня сегодня, распекала, распекала меня, ниже щепки поставила. А вечером у Ратазяева кто-то из них стал вслух читать одно письмо черновое, которое я вам написал, да выронил невзначай из кармана. Матушка моя, какую они насмешку подняли! Величали, величали нас, хохотали, хохотали, предатели! Я вошел к ним и уличил Ратазяева в вероломстве; сказал ему, что он предатель! А Ратазяев отвечал мне, что я сам предатель, что я конкетами [9] разными занимаюсь; говорит, – вы скрывались от нас, вы, дескать, Ловелас [10] ; и теперь все меня Ловеласом зовут, и имени другого нет у меня! Слышите ли, ангельчик мой, слышите ли, – они теперь всё знают, обо всем известны, и об вас, родная моя, знают, и обо всем, что ни есть у вас, обо всем знают! Да чего! и Фальдони туда же, и он заодно с ними; послал я его сегодня в колбасную, так, принести кой-чего; не идет да и только, дело есть, говорит! «Да ведь ты ж обязан», – я говорю. «Да нет же, говорит, не обязан, вы вон моей барыне денег не платите, так я вам и не обязан». Я не вытерпел от него, от необразованного мужика, оскорбления, да и сказал ему дурака; а он мне – «от дурака слышал». Я думаю, что он с пьяных глаз мне такую грубость сказал, – да и говорю, ты, дескать, пьян, мужик ты этакой! а он мне: «Вы, что ли, мне поднесли-то? У самих-то есть ли на что опохмелиться; сами у какой-то по гривенничку христарадничаете, – да еще прибавил: – Эх, дескать, а еще барин!» Вот, маточка, вот до чего дошло дело! Жить, Варенька, совестно! точно оглашенный какой-нибудь; хуже чем беспаспортному бродяге какому-нибудь. Бедствия тяжкие! – погиб я, просто погиб! безвозвратно погиб.","Varvara Alekseevna! my dove, mother! I'm gone, we're both gone, both together, irretrievably gone. My reputation, my ambition, all is lost! I died, and you died, mother, and you, along with me, irrevocably died! It's me, I brought you to death! They drive me away, mother, they despise me, they make fun of me, but the hostess simply began to scold me; screamed, screamed at me today, scolded me, scolded me, put me below a chip. And in the evening at Ratazyaev's, one of them began to read aloud a draft letter that I wrote to you, but accidentally dropped it from my pocket. My mother, what a mockery they lifted! Magnified, magnified us, laughed, laughed, traitors! I went in to them and convicted Ratazyaev of treachery; told him he was a traitor! And Ratazyaev answered me that I myself was a traitor, that I was engaged in various conkets [9]; says, - you were hiding from us, you, they say, Lovelace [10] ; and now everyone calls me Lovelace, and I have no other name! Do you hear, my angel, do you hear - now they know everything, they are known about everything, and they know about you, my dear, and about everything that you have, they know about everything! Why! and Faldoni there too, and he is at one with them; I sent him today to the sausage shop, so bring something; does not go and only, there is a thing, he says! “But you have to,” I say. “No, he says, he’s not obliged, you don’t pay money to my mistress, so I don’t owe you.” I could not stand an insult from him, from an uneducated peasant, and even told him a fool; and he told me - ""I heard from a fool."" I think that he said such rudeness to me from drunken eyes, - and I say, you, they say, are drunk, you are such a man! and he told me: “Did you bring something to me? Do they themselves have something to get drunk on; you yourself are christening for a dime, - and he added: - Oh, they say, and also a gentleman! Here, mother, this is what it has come to! Live, Varenka, ashamed! just announced some; worse than some passportless tramp. Severe disasters! I died, I just died! died irrevocably.","O Barbara Alexievna, I am undone —we are both of us undone! Both of us are lost beyond recall! Everything is ruined—my reputation, my self-respect, all that I have in the world! And you as much as I. Never shall we retrieve what we have lost. I —I have brought you to this pass, for I have become an outcast, my darling. Everywhere I am laughed at and despised. Even my landlady has taken to abusing me. Today she overwhelmed me with shrill reproaches, and abased me to the level of a hearth-brush. And last night, when I was in Rataziaev’s rooms, one of his friends began to read a scribbled note which I had written to you, and then inadvertently pulled out of my pocket. Oh beloved, what laughter there arose at the recital! How those scoundrels mocked and derided you and myself! I walked up to them and accused Rataziaev of breaking faith. I said that he had played the traitor. But he only replied that I had been the betrayer in the case, by indulging in various amours. “You have kept them very dark though, Mr. Lovelace!” said he—and now I am known everywhere by this name of “Lovelace.” They know EVERYTHING about us, my darling, EVERYTHING—both about you and your affairs and about myself; and when today I was for sending Phaldoni to the bakeshop for something or other, he refused to go, saying that it was not his business. “But you MUST go,” said I. “I will not,” he replied. “You have not paid my mistress what you owe her, so I am not bound to run your errands.” At such an insult from a raw peasant I lost my temper, and called him a fool; to which he retorted in a similar vein. Upon this I thought that he must be drunk, and told him so; whereupon he replied: “WHAT say you that I am? Suppose you yourself go and sober up, for I know that the other day you went to visit a woman, and that you got drunk with her on two grivenniks.” To such a pass have things come! I feel ashamed to be seen alive. I am, as it were, a man proclaimed; I am in a worse plight even than a tramp who has lost his passport. How misfortunes are heaping themselves upon me! I am lost—I am lost for ever!","Varvara Alekseyevna! Little mother, my dove! I am lost, we are both lost, both of us together, irretrievably lost. My reputation, mypride – allgone. It is the end of me, and the end of you, little mother, it is the irreversible end of both of us together! And it is I, I who have brought you to this! They are persecuting me, little mother, they treat me with contempt, hold me up to ridicule, and the landlady has simply begun to abuse me; she has been shouting and shouting at me today, she railed and railed at me, reduced me to the lowest of the low. And this evening in Ratazyayev is room one of them began reading out the draft of a letter I’d written you, it had somehow fallen out of my pocket. Mother of mine, what a feast of derision they had over it! They named us, they named us out loud and hooted with laughter, the traitors! I went into the room where they were and accused Ratazyayev of treachery; I told him he was a traitor. Ratazyayev replied that I myself was a traitor, that I spent my time with ‘various conquests’: ‘ You’ve been hiding it from us,’ he said. ‘You’re a Lovelace. ‘ * And now they all call me ‘Lovelace’, and won’t address me by any other name! Do you hear, my little angel, do you hear? Now they know everything, they have all the facts, they know about you, my darling, they know about all your personal matters, they know it all! Why, even Faldoni was there, and he is in cahoots with them; I sent him out to the sausage-shop to buy something; he simply refused to go; ‘I’m busy,’ he said. ‘But you’re obliged to,’ I said. ‘Oh no, I’m not,’ he said; ‘you haven’t paid my mistress her rent, so I’m not obliged to you.’ I wasn’t going to have an uneducated peasant insulting me, and I told him he was a fool; to which he replied: ‘ And you’re another one.’ I think he must have been drunk, to say such an offensive thing to me – and indeed I said to him: ‘You’re drunk, you peasant!’ To which he replied: ‘Well, if I am it is not at your expense, you haven’t got enough money to get drunk yourself; you even go begging for a few copecks from some woman or other.’ And then he added: ‘And you’re a gentleman, too!’ You see what it has come to, little mother? I’m ashamed to go on living, Varenka! Like some kind of outcast; worse than a vagrant without a passport. It is a terrible disaster! -it is the end of me, quite simply the end! The irreversible end!","VARVARA ALEXYEVNA, MY DARLING, I am lost, we are both lost, both together irretrievably lost. My reputation, my dignity—all is destroyed! I am ruined and you are ruined, my darling. You are hopelessly ruined with me! It’s my doing, I have brought you to ruin! I am persecuted, Varinka, I am despised, turned into a laughing-stock, and the landlady has simply begun to abuse me; she shouted and shouted at me, to-day; she rated and rated at me and treated me as though I were dirt. And in the evening, at Ratazyaev’s, one of them began reading aloud the rough copy of a letter to you which I had accidentally dropped out of my pocket. My precious, what a joke they made of it! They called us all sorts of flattering names and roared with laughter, the traitors! I went to them and taxed Ratazyaev with his perfidy, told him he was a traitor! And Ratazyaev answered that I was a traitor myself, that I amused myself with making conquests among the fair sex. He said, “You take good care to keep it from us; you’re a Lovelace,”13 he said; and now they all call me Lovelace and I have no other name! Do you hear, my little angel , do you hear?—they know it all now , they know all about it, and they know about you, my own, and whatever you have, they know about it all! And that’s not all. Even Faldoni is in it, he’s following their lead; I sent him to-day to the sausage-shop to get me something; he wouldn’t go. “I am busy,” that was all he said! “But you know it’s your duty,” I said. “No, indeed,” he said, “it’s not my duty. Here, you don’t pay my mistress her money, so I have no duty to you.” I could not stand this insult from him, an illiterate peasant, and I said, “You fool,” and he answered back, “Fool yourself.” I thought he must have had a drop too much to be so rude, and I said: “You are drunk, you peasant!” and he answered: “Well, not at your expense, anyway, you’ve nothing to get drunk on yourself; you are begging for twenty kopecks from somebody yourself,” and he even added: “Ugh! and a gentleman too!” There, my dear girl, that’s what it has come to! One’s ashamed to be alive, Varinka! As though one were some sort of outcast, worse than a tramp without a passport. An awful calamity! I am ruined, simply ruined! I am irretrievably ruined!"
"Я знала, что у букинистов в Гостином дворе можно купить книгу иногда в полцены дешевле, если только поторговаться, часто малоподержанную и почти совершенно новую. Я положила непременно отправиться в Гостиный двор. Так и случилось; назавтра же встретилась какая-то надобность и у нас и у Анны Федоровны. Матушке понездоровилось, Анна Федоровна очень кстати поленилась, так что пришлось все поручения возложить на меня, и я отправилась вместе с Матреной.","I knew that you could sometimes buy a book from second-hand booksellers in Gostiny Dvor at half the price, if you just bargained, often little used and almost completely new. I decided to go to the Gostiny Dvor by all means. And so it happened; the very next day some need arose both with us and with Anna Fyodorovna. Matushka got sick, Anna Fedorovna was very lazy, so I had to entrust all the assignments to me, and I went with Matryona.","I knew that of the hucksters in the Gostinni Dvor one could sometimes buy a book—even one that had been little used and was almost entirely new—for a half of its price, provided that one haggled sufficiently over it; wherefore I determined to repair thither. It so happened that, next day, both Anna Thedorovna and ourselves were in want of sundry articles; and since my mother was unwell and Anna lazy, the execution of the commissions devolved upon me, and I set forth with Matrena.","I knew that at the second-hand bookstalls of the Gostiny Dvor it was sometimes possible, with a little bargaining, to buy books at half price, scarcely used and almost completely new.

Mother was slightly unwell, and Anna Fyodorovna very conveniently felt too lazy, so I was the one who had to do all the errands, and I set off together with Matryona.","I knew at the second-hand shops in the Gostiny Dvor one could sometimes, with a little bargaining, buy at half-price a book hardly the worse for wear and almost completely new.

"И мне кажется, я бы так была счастлива, если б пришлось хоть всю жизнь мою не выезжать из деревни и жить на одном месте. А между тем я еще дитею принуждена была оставить родные места. Мне было еще только двенадцать лет, когда мы в Петербург переехали. Ах, как я грустно помню наши печальные сборы! Как я плакала, когда прощалась со всем, что так было мило мне. Я помню, что я бросилась на шею батюшке и со слезами умоляла остаться хоть немножко в деревне. Батюшка закричал на меня, матушка плакала; говорила, что надобно, что дела этого требовали. Старый князь П-й умер. Наследники отказали батюшке от должности. У батюшки были кой-какие деньги в оборотах в руках частных лиц в Петербурге. Надеясь поправить свои обстоятельства, он почел необходимым свое личное здесь присутствие. Все это я узнала после от матушки. Мы здесь поселились на Петербургской стороне и прожили на одном месте до самой кончины батюшки.","And it seems to me that I would be so happy if I had to stay at least my whole life not to leave the village and live in one place. Meanwhile, as a child, I was forced to leave my native places. I was only twelve years old when we moved to Petersburg. Oh, how sadly I remember our sad gatherings! How I cried when I said goodbye to everything that was so sweet to me. I remember that I threw myself on the father's neck and begged with tears to stay at least a little in the village. Father shouted at me, mother cried; She said that it was necessary, that things demanded it. Old Prince II died. The heirs refused the priest from the post. The priest had some money in circulation in the hands of private individuals in St. Petersburg. Hoping to improve his circumstances, he found it necessary to be personally present here. I learned all this from my mother. We settled here on the Petersburg side and lived in one place until the very death of the father.","Had it befallen me never to quit that village—had it befallen me to remain for ever in that spot—I should always have been happy; but fate ordained that I should leave my birthplace even before my girlhood had come to an end. In short, I was only twelve years old when we removed to St. Petersburg. Ah! how it hurts me to recall the mournful gatherings before our departure, and to recall how bitterly I wept when the time came for us to say farewell to all that I had held so dear! I remember throwing myself upon my father’s neck, and beseeching him with tears to stay in the country a little longer; but he bid me be silent, and my mother, adding her tears to mine, explained that business matters compelled us to go. As a matter of fact, old Prince P—— had just died, and his heirs had dismissed my father from his post; whereupon, since he had a little money privately invested in St. Petersburg, he bethought him that his personal presence in the capital was necessary for the due management of his affairs. It was my mother who told me this. Consequently we settled here in St. Petersburg, and did not again move until my father died.","And I think that I should have been truly happy if it had been necessary for me to spend my entire life never leaving the village and staying in the same place. As it turned out, I had to leave my native corner while still a child. I was only twelve when we moved to St Petersburg. Oh, with what sadness I recall our melancholy preparations. How I wept as I said goodbye to all that was so dear to me. Father began to shout at me, and Mother cried; she said that there was nothing for it, that Father’s business demanded it. Old Prince P. had died. The inheritors had dismissed Father from his position. Father had some money which was being circulated among private individuals in St Petersburg. In the hope of easing his financial difficulties, he decided it would be best for him to be present here in the capital himself. I found all this out from Mother later on. We settled here on the St Petersburg Side* and lived in the same place right up until Father is death.","And it seems to me that I should have been so happy if it had been my lot to have spent all my life in one place and never to have left the country. But I had to leave my native place while I was still a child. I was only twelve when we moved to Petersburg. Ah, how well I remember our sorrowful preparations! How I cried when I said goodbye to everything that was so dear to me. I remember that I threw myself on father’s neck and besought him with tears to remain a little longer in the country. Father scolded me, mother wept; she said that we had to go, that we could not help it. Old Prince P—was dead. His heirs had discharged father from his post. Father had some money in the hands of private persons in Petersburg. Hoping to improve his position he thought his presence here in person essential. All this I learnt from mother. We settled here on the Petersburg Side and lived in the same spot up to the time of father’s death."

Here is a conversation between Yermak and Zyuleika:","With your permission I will also quote you an extract from Rataziaev’s story, Ermak and Zuleika:","The gist of the story, little mother, is that the Cossack Yermak, the fierce and terrible conqueror of Siberia, has fallen in love with Suleika, who is the daughter of the Siberian Tsar Kuchum, and who has been taken captive by him. An event straight from the times of Ivan the Terrible, as you will be aware. Here is the dialogue of Yermak and Suleika:","You must imagine, my precious, that the Cossack, Yermak, the fierce and savage conqueror of Siberia, is in love with the daughter of Kutchum, the Tsar of Siberia, the Princess Zuleika, who has been taken captive by him. An episode straight from the times of Ivan the Terrible, as you see. Here is the conversation of Yermak and Zuleika."
"Я не знаю, чем бы это все кончилось, если б сближению нашему не помогло одно странное обстоятельство. Однажды вечером, когда матушка сидела у Анны Федоровны, я тихонько вошла в комнату Покровского. Я знала, что его не было дома, и, право, не знаю, отчего мне вздумалось войти к нему. До сих пор я никогда и не заглядывала к нему, хотя мы прожили рядом уже с лишком год. В этот раз сердце у меня билось так сильно, так сильно, что, казалось, из груди хотело выпрыгнуть. Я осмотрелась кругом с каким-то особенным любопытством. Комната Покровского была весьма бедно убрана; порядка было мало. На стенах прибито было пять длинных полок с книгами. На столе и на стульях лежали бумаги. Книги да бумаги! Меня посетила странная мысль, и вместе с тем какое-то неприятное чувство досады овладело мною. Мне казалось, что моей дружбы, моего любящего сердца было мало ему. Он был учен, а я была глупа и ничего не знала, ничего не читала, ни одной книги… Тут я завистливо поглядела на длинные полки, которые ломились под книгами. Мною овладела досада, тоска, какое-то бешенство. Мне захотелось, и я тут же решилась прочесть его книги, все до одной, и как можно скорее. Не знаю, может быть, я думала, что, научившись всему, что он знал, буду достойнее его дружбы, Я бросилась к первой полке; не думая, не останавливаясь, схватила в руки первый попавшийся запыленный, старый том и, краснея, бледнея, дрожа от волнения и страха, утащила к себе краденую книгу, решившись прочесть ее ночью, у ночника, когда заснет матушка.","I do not know how it would all have ended if one strange circumstance had not helped our rapprochement. One evening, when my mother was sitting with Anna Fyodorovna, I quietly entered Pokrovsky's room. I knew that he was not at home, and, really, I do not know why I took it into my head to go in to him. Until now, I have never looked at him, although we have lived nearby for more than a year. This time my heart was beating so hard, so hard that it seemed to want to jump out of my chest. I looked around with a peculiar curiosity. Pokrovsky's room was very poorly decorated; there was little order. There were five long shelves of books nailed to the walls. There were papers on the table and chairs. Books and papers! A strange thought came to me, and at the same time some unpleasant feeling of annoyance took possession of me. It seemed to me that my friendship, my loving heart was not enough for him. He was a scholar, but I was stupid and didn’t know anything, didn’t read anything, not a single book ... Then I looked enviously at the long shelves that were breaking under the books. Annoyance, melancholy, a kind of rage took possession of me. I wanted to, and I immediately decided to read his books, every one of them, and as soon as possible. I don’t know, maybe I thought that having learned everything he knew, I would be worthy of his friendship, I rushed to the first shelf; without thinking, without stopping, she grabbed the first dusty, old volume that came across in her hands and, blushing, turning pale, trembling with excitement and fear, dragged the stolen book to her, deciding to read it at night, by the night lamp, when mother fell asleep.","How it would all have ended I do not know , had not a curious incident helped to bring about a rapprochement. One evening, when my mother was sitting in Anna Thedorovna’s room, I crept on tiptoe to Pokrovski’s apartment, in the belief that he was not at home. Some strange impulse moved me to do so. True, we had lived cheek by jowl with one another; yet never once had I caught a glimpse of his abode. Consequently my heart beat loudly—so loudly, indeed, that it seemed almost to be bursting from my breast. On entering the room I glanced around me with tense interest. The apartment was very poorly furnished, and bore few traces of orderliness. On table and chairs there lay heaps of books; everywhere were books and papers. Then a strange thought entered my head, as well as, with the thought, an unpleasant feeling of irritation. It seemed to me that my friendship, my heart’s affection, meant little to him, for HE was well-educated, whereas I was stupid, and had learned nothing, and had read not a single book. So I stood looking wistfully at the long bookshelves where they groaned under their weight of volumes. I felt filled with grief, disappointment, and a sort of frenzy. I felt that I MUST read those books, and decided to do so—to read them one by one, and with all possible speed. Probably the idea was that, by learning whatsoever HE knew, I should render myself more worthy of his friendship. So, I made a rush towards the bookcase nearest me, and, without stopping further to consider matters, seized hold of the first dusty tome upon which my hands chanced to alight, and, reddening and growing pale by turns, and trembling with fear and excitement, clasped the stolen book to my breast with the intention of reading it by candle light while my mother lay asleep at night.","I do not know how all this would have ended, had not a certain strange circumstance contrived to bring us close to each other. One evening, when Mother was talking to Anna Fyodorovna, I quietly entered Pokrovsky is room. I knew that he was not at home, and I do not really know why I took it into my head to go in. Until that time I had never paid him even the briefest visit, even though we had been living next door to each other for more than a year. On this occasion my heart beat so violently that I thought it might burst out of me. I looked around me with intense curiosity. Pokrovsky’s room was very shabbily furnished; it was not very tidy. Five long bookshelves containing books had been nailed to the walls. The table and the chairs were heaped with papers. Books and papers! I suddenly had a strange thought, and at the same time a nasty sense of disappointment took hold of me. It seemed that my friendship and my loving heart were of little account to him. He was educated, while I was stupid and knew nothing, had read nothing, not a single book… At this point I cast an envious glance at the long shelves sagging with books. I was seized with disappointment, depression, a kind of rage. I conceived a desire, which I acted on at once, to read his books, every single one of them, as quickly as possible. I am not sure, but perhaps I thought that if I learned everything he knew, I should be more worthy of his friendship. I rushed to the first shelf; without thinking, without hesitating, I seized the first dusty old tome that fell into my hands and, blushing, trembling with fear and agitation, carried the stolen book off to my room, having decided to read it at night, by the glow from the night-light, when mother was asleep.","I do not know how all this would have ended if a strange circumstance had not helped to bring us together. One evening when mother was sitting with Anna Fyodorovna I went stealthily into Pokrovsky’s room. I knew he was not at home, and I really don’t know what put it into my head to go into his room. Until that moment I had never peeped into it, though we had lived next door for over a year. This time my heart throbbed violently, so violently that it seemed it would leap out of my bosom. I looked around with peculiar curiosity. Pokrovsky’s room was very poorly furnished: it was untidy. Papers were lying on the table and the chairs. Books and papers! A strange thought came to me, and at the same time an unpleasant feeling of vexation took possession of me. It seemed to me that my affection, my loving heart were little to him. He was learned while I was stupid, and knew nothing, had read nothing, not a single book ... at that point I looked enviously at the long shelves which were almost breaking down under the weight of the books. I was overcome by anger, misery, a sort of fury. I longed and at once determined to read his books, every one of them, and as quickly as possible. I don’t know, perhaps I thought that when I learned all he knew I should be more worthy of his friendship. I rushed to the first shelf; without stopping to think I seized the first dusty old volume; flushing and turning pale by turns, trembling with excitement and dread, I carried off the stolen book, resolved to read it at night—by the night-light while mother was asleep."

"Я – то есть брильянтщик говорит – хорошо; а я про себя хотел сначала сказать, что я заболел и встать не могу с постели. Вот теперь, как время пришло хлопотливое, нужное, так и простуды напали, враг их возьми! Тоже уведомляю вас, что к довершению несчастий моих и его превосходительство изволили быть строгими, и на Емельяна Ивановича много сердились и кричали, и под конец совсем измучились, бедненькие. Вот я вас уведомляю обо всем. Да еще хотел вам написать что-нибудь, только вас утруждать боюсь. Ведь я, маточка, человек глупый, простой, пишу себе что ни попало, так, может быть, вы там чего-нибудь и такого – ну, да уж что!","I - that is, the diamond maker says - good; and I first wanted to say to myself that I was ill and could not get out of bed. Now, as the troublesome, necessary time has come, so the colds have attacked, the enemy take them! I also inform you that, to complete my misfortunes, His Excellency deigned to be strict, and they got angry and shouted a lot at Yemelyan Ivanovich, and in the end they were completely exhausted, poor things. Here I inform you about everything. And I also wanted to write something to you, but I'm afraid to bother you. After all, I, mother, am a stupid, simple person, I write to myself whatever comes my way, so maybe you are there for something and such - well, yes!","Unfortunately, I have also to say that I myself have fallen ill, and cannot rise from bed. Just when so many things need to be done, I have gone and caught a chill, the devil take it! Also I have to tell you that, to complete my misfortunes, his Excellency has been pleased to become stricter. Today he railed at and scolded Emelia Ivanovitch until the poor fellow was quite put about. That is the sum of my news. No—there is something else concerning which I should like to write to you, but am afraid to obtrude upon your notice. I am a simple, dull fellow who writes down whatsoever first comes into his head— Your friend,","I – what I mean is, the jeweller said it’s all right; I was going to begin by telling you that I’ve been taken ill and can’t get out of bed. I would have to go and catch a cold now, at such a busy time when there are so many urgent things to be seen to, the devil take it! I am also writing to inform you that, to complete my store of misfortune , His Excellency has flown off the handle – he lost his temper with Yemelyan Ivanovich, too, and shouted at him, so that the poor fellow was worried nearly to death. So you see, I am keeping you informed of everything. I wanted to tell you something else, too, but I’m afraid of causing you too much trouble. After all, little mother, I’m just a simple, stupid fellow, I just write whatever comes into my head, and you might very well not wish to – well, it doesn’t matter!","I—that is, the jeweller said—very good; and I meant to say at first that I have been taken ill and cannot get up. Here now, at such an urgent, busy time I have caught a cold, the devil take it! I must tell you, to complete my misfortunes, his Excellency was pleased to be stern and was very angry with Emelyan Ivanovitch and scolded him, and he was quite worn out at last, poor man. You see, I tell you about everything. I wanted to write to you about something else, but I am afraid to trouble you. You see, I am a foolish, simple man, Varinka, I just write what comes, so that, maybe, you may—But there, never mind!"
"Федора мне достала книжку – «Повести Белкина», которую вам посылаю, если захотите читать. Пожалуйста, только не запачкайте и не задержите: книга чужая; это Пушкина сочинение. Два года тому назад мы читали эти повести вместе с матушкой, и теперь мне так грустно было их перечитывать. Если у вас есть какие-нибудь книги, то пришлите мне, – только в таком случае, когда вы их не от Ратазяева получили. Он, наверно, даст своего сочинения, если он что-нибудь напечатал. Как это вам нравятся его сочинения, Макар Алексеевич? Такие пустяки… Ну, прощайте! как я заболталась! Когда мне грустно, так я рада болтать, хоть об чем-нибудь. Это лекарство: тотчас легче сделается, а особливо, если выскажешь все, что лежит на сердце. Прощайте, прощайте, мой друг!","Fyodor got me a book - Belkin's Tale, which I am sending you if you want to read it. Please, just don't get dirty and don't delay: the book is someone else's; This is Pushkin's work. Two years ago we read these stories together with my mother, and now I was so sad to re-read them. If you have any books, then send them to me - only in such a case when you did not receive them from Ratazyaev. He will probably give his essay if he has printed anything. How do you like his compositions, Makar Alekseevich? Such trifles... Well, goodbye! how I got sick! When I'm sad, I'm so glad to chat, at least about something. This is a medicine: it will immediately become easier, and especially if you express everything that lies on your heart. Farewell, farewell my friend!","Also, Thedora has brought me a book—“The Stories of Bielkin”—which I will forward you, if you would care to read it. Only, do not soil it, nor yet retain it, for it does not belong to me. It is by Pushkin. Two years ago I read these stories with my mother, and it would hurt me to read them again. If you yourself have any books, pray let me have them—so long as they have not been obtained from Rataziaev. Probably he will be giving you one of his own works when he has had one printed. How is it that his compositions please you so much, Makar Alexievitch? I think them SUCH rubbish! —Now goodbye. How I have been chattering on! When feeling sad, I always like to talk of something, for it acts upon me like medicine—I begin to feel easier as soon as I have uttered what is preying upon my heart.

"Да ведь это умора, Варенька, просто умора! Мы со смеху катались, когда он читал нам это. Этакой он, прости его господи! Впрочем, маточка, оно хоть и немного затейливо и уж слишком игриво, но зато невинно, без малейшего вольнодумства и либеральных мыслей. Нужно заметить, маточка, что Ратазяев прекрасного поведения и потому превосходный писатель, не то что другие писатели.","Why, this is a scream, Varenka, just a scream! We rolled with laughter when he read it to us. He is like that, God forgive him! However, mother, although it is a little intricate and too playful, it is innocent, without the slightest free-thinking and liberal thoughts. It should be noted, mother, that Ratazyaev is of excellent behavior and therefore an excellent writer, not like other writers.","what purest humour! We rocked with laughter when he read it aloud to us. Yes, that is the kind of man he is. Possibly the passage is a trifle over-frolicsome, but at least it is harmless, and contains no freethought or liberal ideas. In passing, I may say that Rataziaev is not only a supreme writer, but also a man of upright life—which is more than can be said for most writers.","I mean, that’s killing, Varenka, simply killing! We rolled about with laughter when he read us that. He’s such a one, may the Lord forgive him! But you know, Varenka, although it’s a bit fanciful and rather too frivolous, it’s none the less innocent, without the slightest trace of free-thinking or liberal ideas. I should observe, little mother, that Ratazyayev is a man of impeccable behaviour and is for that reason a first-rate author – not like some other authors I could mention.","That’s humour, you know, Varinka, simply humour. He rocked with laughter when he read us that. He is a fellow, God forgive him! But though it’s rather jocose and very playful, Varinka dear, it is quite innocent, without the slightest trace of free-thinking or liberal ideas.
