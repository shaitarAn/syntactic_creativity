"— Осмелюсь обеспокоить, ваше благородие, — сказал он с почтительностью, но с относительным пренебрежением к юности этого офицера и заложив руку за пазуху. — Моя госпожа, дочь скончавшегося сего пятнадцатого числа генерал-аншефа князя Николая Андреевича Болконского, находясь в затруднении по случаю невежества этих лиц, — он указал на мужиков, — просит вас пожаловать… не угодно ли будет, — с грустной улыбкой сказал Алпатыч, — отъехать несколько, а то не так удобно при… — Алпатыч указал на двух мужиков, которые сзади так и носились около него, как слепни около лошади.","“I dare to disturb, Your Honor,” he said with deference, but with relative disdain for the youth of this officer, and putting his hand in his bosom. “My lady, the daughter of General-in-Chief Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, who died this fifteenth day, being in difficulty because of the ignorance of these persons,” he pointed to the peasants, “asks you to come in ... if you like,” Alpatych said with a sad smile, “ drive off a little, otherwise it’s not so convenient when ... - Alpatych pointed to two men who were rushing around him from behind, like horseflies near a horse.","“I make so bold as to trouble you, Your Honor,” he said respectfully, but with relative scorn for the youth of this officer, and putting his hand behind his lapel. “My mistress, the daughter of General in Chief Prince Nikolai Andree-vich Bolkonsky, who passed away on the fifteenth instant, being in difficulty on the occasion of the ignorance of these persons,” he pointed to the muzhiks, “asks you kindly ... would you be so good,” Alpatych said with a sad smile, “as to ride off a little, for it is not so convenient in front of ...” Alpatych pointed to the two muzhiks, who flitted about behind him like gadflies around a horse.","‘May I make bold to trouble your Honour?’ said he respectfully, but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom. ‘My mistress, daughter of General-in-Chief Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky who died on the 15th of this month, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people’—he pointed to the peasants—’asks you to come up to the house … Won’t you, please, ride on a little farther,’ said Alpatych with a melancholy smile, ‘as it is not convenient in the presence of …?’ He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse."
"Камердинер приподнялся и прошептал что-то. Тимохин, страдая от боли в раненой ноге, не спал и во все глаза смотрел на странное явление девушки в бедой рубашке, кофте и вечном чепчике. Сонные и испуганные слова камердинера; «Чего вам, зачем?» — только заставили скорее Наташу подойти и тому, что лежало в углу. Как ни страшно, ни непохоже на человеческое было это тело, она должна была его видеть. Она миновала камердинера: нагоревший гриб свечки свалился, и она ясно увидала лежащего с выпростанными руками на одеяле князя Андрея, такого, каким она его всегда видела.","The valet rose and whispered something. Timokhin, suffering from pain in his wounded leg, did not sleep and looked with all his eyes at the strange appearance of a girl in a poor shirt, jacket and eternal cap. The sleepy and frightened words of the valet; ""What do you want, why?"" - they only forced Natasha to come up to the one that lay in the corner as soon as possible. As terrifying as this body was, it must have been visible to her. She passed the valet: the burning mushroom of the candle fell off, and she clearly saw Prince Andrei lying on the blanket with outstretched arms, just as she had always seen him.","The valet rose a little and whispered something. Timokhin, suffering from the pain in his wounded leg, was not asleep and stared all eyes at the strange apparition of a girl in a white nightgown, a jacket, and a nightcap.

However frightening and unlike anything human this body was, she had to see it , She went past the valet; the mushroom of snuff fell from the candle, and she clearly saw Prince Andrei lying with his arms on the covers, the same as she had always seen him.","The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing-jacket, and night-cap. The valet’s sleepy, frightened exclamation, ‘ What do you want? What’s the matter?’ made Natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrei clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and just as she had always seen him."
"Начинало светать, небо расчистило, только одна туча лежала на востоке. Покинутые костры догорали в слабом свете утра.","It began to dawn, the sky cleared, only one cloud lay in the east.

"Графине понравилось это усердие Наташи; она в душе своей, после безуспешного медицинского лечения, надеялась, что молитва поможет ей больше лекарств, и хотя со страхом и скрывая от доктора, но согласилась на желание Наташи и поручила ее Беловой. Аграфена Ивановна в три часа ночи приходила будить Наташу и большей частью находила ее уже не спящею. Наташа боялась проспать время заутрени. Поспешно умываясь и с смирением одеваясь в самое дурное свое платье и старенькую мантилью, содрогаясь от свежести, Наташа выходила на пустынные улицы, прозрачно освещенные утренней зарей. По совету Аграфены Ивановны, Наташа говела не в своем приходе, а в церкви, в которой, по словам набожной Беловой, был священник весьма строгий и высокой жизни. В церкви всегда было мало народа; Наташа с Беловой становились на привычное место перед иконой божией матери, вделанной в зад левого клироса, и новое для Наташи чувство смирения перед великим, непостижимым, охватывало ее, когда она в этот непривычный час утра, глядя на черный лик божией матери, освещенный и свечами, горевшими перед ним, и светом утра, падавшим из окна, слушала звуки службы, за которыми она старалась следить, понимая их. Когда она понимала их, ее личное чувство с своими оттенками присоединялось к ее молитве; когда она не понимала, ей еще сладостнее было думать, что желание понимать все есть гордость, что понимать всего нельзя, что надо только верить и отдаваться богу, который в эти минуты — она чувствовала — управлял ее душою. Она крестилась, кланялась и, когда не понимала, то только, ужасаясь перед своею мерзостью, просила бога простить ее за все, за все, и помиловать. Молитвы, которым она больше всего отдавалась, были молитвы раскаяния. Возвращаясь домой в ранний час утра, когда встречались только каменщики, шедшие на работу, дворники, выметавшие улицу, и в домах еще все спали, Наташа испытывала новое для нее чувство возможности исправления себя от своих пороков и возможности новой, чистой жизни и счастия.","The countess liked Natasha's zeal; in her soul, after unsuccessful medical treatment, she hoped that prayer would help her with more medicines, and although with fear and hiding from the doctor, she agreed to Natasha's desire and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna came at three o'clock in the morning to wake Natasha, and for the most part found her no longer asleep. Natasha was afraid to oversleep the time of matins. Hastily washing herself and humbly dressing in her worst dress and an old mantilla, shuddering with freshness, Natasha went out into the deserted streets, transparently lit by the morning dawn. On the advice of Agrafena Ivanovna, Natasha did not preach in her parish, but in the church, in which, according to the pious Belova, there was a priest of a very strict and high life. There were always few people in the church; Natasha and Belova took their usual place in front of the icon of the Mother of God, embedded in the back of the left choir, and Natasha’s new sense of humility in front of the great, incomprehensible, seized her when, at this unusual hour in the morning, she looked at the black face of the Mother of God, lit by candles. burning in front of him, and by the light of the morning falling from the window, she listened to the sounds of the service, which she tried to follow, understanding them. When she understood them, her personal feeling with its shades joined her prayer; when she did not understand, it was still sweeter for her to think that the desire to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to understand everything, that one must only believe and surrender to God, who at that moment—she felt—ruled her soul. She crossed herself, bowed, and when she did not understand, she only, horrified by her abomination, asked God to forgive her for everything, for everything, and have mercy. The prayers to which she devoted herself most were the prayers of repentance. Returning home at an early hour in the morning, when only masons going to work, janitors sweeping the street, and everyone was still sleeping in the houses, Natasha experienced a new feeling for her of the possibility of correcting herself from her vices and the possibility of a new, pure life and happiness.","The countess liked this zeal of Natasha's; after the unsuccessful medical treatment, she hoped in her heart that prayer would help her more than medications, and she consented to Natasha's wish, though with fear and concealing it from the doctor, and entrusted her to Mrs. Belov. Agrafena Ivanovna would come at three o'clock in the morning to wake Natasha, and most often found her already up. Natasha was afraid to sleep through the time for matins. Washing hastily and dressing humbly in the poorest of her dresses and an old mantilla, shivering in the fresh air, Natasha would go out into the deserted streets, transparently lit up by the glow of dawn. On Agrafena Ivanovna's advice, Natasha went to the services not in her own parish, but in a church in which, according to the pious Mrs. Belov, there was a priest of quite strict and lofty life. In the church there were always few people; Natasha and Mrs. Belov would stand in their usual place before the icon of the Mother of God, built into the back of the left-hand choir, and a new feeling of humility would come over Natasha before the great, the unknowable, when at this unaccustomed hour of morning, looking at the blackened face of the Mother of God lit by candles and the light of morning coming from the window, she listened to the words of the service, which she tried to follow and understand.[203] When she understood them, her personal feeling, with its nuances, joined with her prayer; when she did not, the sweeter it was for her to think that the wish to understand everything was pride, that it was impossible to understand everything, that she only had to believe and give herself to God, who in those moments—she felt—was guiding her soul. She crossed herself, bowed, and, when she did not understand, only asked God, in horror at her own vileness, to forgive her for everything, everything, and to have mercy on her. The prayers she gave herself to most of all were prayers of repentance. Returning home at an early hour of the morning, when she met only masons going to work and yard porters sweeping the streets, and everyone in the houses was still asleep, Natasha experienced a new feeling of the possibility of correcting her vices and the possibility of a new, pure life and happiness.","The countess was pleased with Natasha’s zeal; after the poor results of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without fear, and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natasha’s wish and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna used to come to wake Natasha at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agrafena Ivanovna’s advice Natasha prepared herself not in their own parish, but at a church where according to the devout Agrafena Ivanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never many people in the church; Natasha always stood beside Belova in the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin let into the screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them, her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything, everything, and to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep, Natasha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness."

"Но он не успел еще сообразить того, что полковник был убит, что кричавший «братцы!» был пленный, что в глазах его был заколон штыком в спину другой солдат. Едва он вбежал в окоп, как худощавый, желтый, с потным лицом человек в синем мундире, со шпагой в руке, набежал на него, крича что-то. Пьер, инстинктивно обороняясь от толчка, так как они, не видав, разбежались друг против друга, выставил руки и схватил этого человека (это был французский офицер) одной рукой за плечо, другой за горло.

"Наполеон тотчас заметил то, что они делали, и догадался, что они были еще не готовы. Он не захотел лишить их удовольствия сделать ему сюрприз. Он притворился, что не видит господина Боссе, и подозвал к себе Фабвье. Наполеон слушал, строго нахмурившись и молча, то, что говорил Фабвье ему о храбрости и преданности его войск, дравшихся при Саламанке на другом конце Европы и имевших только одну мысль — быть достойными своего императора, и один страх — не угодить ему.

"Хотя и оборванные, голодные, измученные и уменьшенные до 1/3 части своей прежней численности, французские солдаты вступили в Москву еще в стройном порядке. Это было измученное, истощенное, но еще боевое и грозное войско. Но это было войско только до той минуты, пока солдаты этого войска не разошлись по квартирам. Как только люди полков стали расходиться по пустым и богатым домам, так навсегда уничтожалось войско и образовались не жители и не солдаты, а что-то среднее, называемое мародерами. Когда, через пять недель, те же самые люди вышли из Москвы, они уже не составляли более войска. Это была толпа мародеров, из которых каждый вез или нес с собой кучу вещей, которые ему казались ценны и нужны. Цель каждого из этих людей при выходе из Москвы не состояла, как прежде, в том, чтобы завоевать, а только в том, чтобы удержать приобретенное. Подобно той обезьяне, которая, запустив руку в узкое горло кувшина и захватив горсть орехов, не разжимает кулака, чтобы не потерять схваченного, и этим губит себя, французы, при выходе из Москвы, очевидно, должны были погибнуть вследствие того, что они тащили с собой награбленное, но бросить это награбленное им было так же невозможно, как невозможно обезьяне разжать горсть с орехами. Через десять минут после вступления каждого французского полка в какой-нибудь квартал Москвы, не оставалось ни одного солдата и офицера. В окнах домов видны были люди в шинелях и штиблетах, смеясь прохаживающиеся по комнатам; в погребах, в подвалах такие же люди хозяйничали с провизией; на дворах такие же люди отпирали или отбивали ворота сараев и конюшен; в кухнях раскладывали огни, с засученными руками пекли, месили и варили, пугали, смешили и ласкали женщин и детей. И этих людей везде, и по лавкам и по домам, было много; но войска уже не было.","Although ragged, hungry, exhausted and reduced to 1/3 of their former strength, the French soldiers entered Moscow in orderly order. It was an exhausted, exhausted, but still fighting and formidable army. But this was an army only until the moment when the soldiers of this army dispersed to their quarters. As soon as the people of the regiments began to disperse to empty and rich houses, the army was forever destroyed and not residents and not soldiers were formed, but something in between, called marauders. When, after five weeks, the same people left Moscow, they no longer constituted an army. It was a crowd of marauders, each of whom was carrying or carrying with him a bunch of things that he thought were valuable and needed. The goal of each of these people when leaving Moscow was not, as before, to win, but only to keep what they had acquired. Like that monkey who, having put his hand into the narrow throat of a jug and seized a handful of nuts, does not open his fist so as not to lose what he has seized, and this destroys himself, the French, when leaving Moscow, obviously had to die due to the fact that they were dragging with loot, but it was as impossible for him to give up this loot as it is impossible for a monkey to unclench a handful of nuts. Ten minutes after the entry of each French regiment into some quarter of Moscow, not a single soldier and officer remained. In the windows of the houses one could see people in overcoats and boots, laughingly pacing around the rooms; in the cellars, in the cellars, the same people were in charge with provisions; in the yards, the same people unlocked or beat off the gates of sheds and stables; fires were laid out in the kitchens, with rolled up hands they baked, kneaded and boiled, frightened, made laugh and caressed women and children. And there were many of these people everywhere, both in shops and in houses; but the troops were gone.","Though ragged, famished, exhausted, and reduced to a third of their former number, the French soldiers still entered Moscow in an orderly manner. This was an exhausted, emaciated, but still warlike and menacing army. But it was an army only until the moment when the soldiers of that army dispersed to quarters. As soon as the men of the regiments began to disperse among the empty and wealthy houses, the army was annihilated forever, and what emerged were neither inhabitants nor soldiers, but something between the two, known as looters. When the same men left Moscow five weeks later, they no longer constituted an army. They were a mob of looters, each of whom drove or carried with him a heap of things that seemed valuable or useful to him. The goal of each of these men, as they were leaving Moscow, did not consist, as before, in conquering, but only in keeping what they had acquired. Like the monkey who, putting its hand into the narrow mouth of a jug and seizing a handful of nuts, will not open its fist, so as not to lose what it has seized, and thereby perishes, so the French, in leaving Moscow, were obviously bound to perish as a result of dragging their loot with them, but to abandon that loot was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to let go of its handful of nuts. Ten minutes after any French regiment entered some quarter of Moscow, there was not a single soldier or officer left. In the windows of the houses, people in greatcoats and leggings could be seen laughing and strolling through the rooms; in cellars and basements, the same sort of people were bustling about with provisions; in the courtyards, the same sort of people opened or broke down the gates of sheds and stables; in the kitchens they made fires and, with their sleeves rolled up, baked, kneaded, and cooked, frightened, amused, and fondled the women and children. And there were many of these people everywhere in the shops and houses; but there was no more army.","Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But it only remained an army until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost for ever and there came into being something nondescript, neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and store-rooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach-house and stable doors; lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the shops and houses—but there was no army."
"«О господи, народ-то что зверь, где же живому быть!» — слышалось в толпе. — И малый-то молодой… должно, из купцов, то-то народ!.. сказывают, не тот… как же не тот… О господи… Другого избили, говорят, чуть жив… Эх, народ… Кто греха не боится… — говорили теперь те же люди, с болезненно-жалостным выражением глядя на мертвое тело с посиневшим, измазанным кровью и пылью лицом и с разрубленной длинной тонкой шеей.","“Oh my God, the people are like a beast, where can the living be!” was heard in the crowd. “And a young fellow ... must be from merchants, that’s the people! .. they say, not that one ... how not that one ...

"К третьей партии, к которой более всего имел доверия государь, принадлежали придворные делатели сделок между обоими направлениями. Люди этой партии, большей частью не военные и к которой принадлежал Аракчеев, думали и говорили, что говорят обыкновенно люди, не имеющие убеждений, но желающие казаться за таковых. Они говорили, что, без сомнения, война, особенно с таким гением, как Бонапарте (его опять называли Бонапарте), требует глубокомысленнейших соображений, глубокого знания науки, и в этом деле Пфуль гениален; но вместе с тем нельзя не признать того, что теоретики часто односторонни, и потому не надо вполне доверять им, надо прислушиваться и к тому, что говорят противники Пфуля, и к тому, что говорят люди практические, опытные в военном деле, и изо всего взять среднее. Люди этой партии настояли на том, чтобы, удержав Дрисский лагерь по плану Пфуля, изменить движения других армий. Хотя этим образом действий не достигалась ни та, ни другая цель, но людям этой партии казалось так лучше.","The third party, in which the sovereign had the most confidence, belonged to the court makers of transactions between both directions. The people of this party, for the most part non-military and to which Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what people usually say who have no convictions, but who wish to appear as such. They said that, without a doubt, a war, especially with such a genius as Bonaparte (he was again called Bonaparte), requires the most profound considerations, a deep knowledge of science, and in this matter Pfuel is a genius; but at the same time it is impossible not to admit that theoreticians are often one-sided, and therefore one should not completely trust them, one must listen both to what Pfuel's opponents say, and to what practical people, experienced in military affairs, and from everything take the average. The people of this party insisted that, by holding the Drissa camp according to the Pfuel plan, they would change the movements of other armies. Although neither one nor the other goal was achieved by this course of action, it seemed better to the people of this party.","To the third party, which the sovereign trusted most of all, belonged the courtiers who made little deals between these two tendencies. The people of this party, for the most part nonmilitary, and to whom Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what people usually say who have no convictions but wish to seem as if they do. They said that war, especially with such a genius as Bonaparte (he was again known as Bonaparte), undoubtedly called for the most profoundly pondered considerations, for a profound knowledge of science, and in this matter Pfuel was a genius; but along with that, one could not help admitting that theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one must not fully trust them, one must lend an ear to what Pfuel's opponents and practical people. experienced in military affairs, have to say, and choose a middle course. The people of this party insisted on holding on to the Drissa camp, according to Pfuel's plan, while changing the movements of the other armies. Though this course of action attained neither one goal nor the other, to the people of this party it seemed better that way.","To the third party—in which the Emperor had most confidence—belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians, and to whom Arakcheev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some, generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte again now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge, and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel’s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa according to Pfuel’s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. Though by this course neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party."

"«Стыдно бежать от опасности; только трусы бегут из Москвы», — говорили им. Растопчин в своих афишках внушал им, что уезжать из Москвы было позорно. Им совестно было получать наименование трусов, совестно было ехать, но они все-таки ехали, зная, что так надо было. Зачем они ехали? Нельзя предположить, чтобы Растопчин напугал их ужасами, которые производил Наполеон в покоренных землях. Уезжали, и первые уехали богатые, образованные люди, знавшие очень хорошо, что Вена и Берлин остались целы и что там, во время занятия их Наполеоном, жители весело проводили время с обворожительными французами, которых так любили тогда русские мужчины и в особенности дамы.","“It is a shame to run from danger; only cowards flee from Moscow,” they were told. Rostopchin inspired them in his posters that it was shameful to leave Moscow. They were ashamed to receive the title of cowards, they were ashamed to go, but they still went, knowing that it was necessary to do so. Why were they driving? It cannot be assumed that Rostopchin frightened them with the horrors that Napoleon produced in the conquered lands. Wealthy, educated people were the first to leave, and they knew very well that Vienna and Berlin remained intact and that there, during their occupation by Napoleon, the inhabitants had fun with the charming French, who were then so loved by Russian men and especially ladies.","“It is shameful to flee from danger, only cowards are fleeing Moscow,” they were told. Rastopchin in his little posters kept instilling in them that to leave Moscow was disgraceful. People were ashamed to be called cowards, were ashamed to go, but all the same they went, knowing that it had to be so. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that Rastopchin had frightened them with the horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered lands. The first to leave were the rich, educated people, who knew very well that Vienna and Berlin remained intact and that there, during Napoleon's occupation, the citizens passed the time gaily with the charming Frenchmen, whom the Russians, and especially the ladies, liked so much then.","‘It is disgraceful to run away from danger, only cowards are running away from Moscow,’ they were told. In his broadsheets Rastopchin impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that Rastopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact, and that during Napoleon’s occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so much."

Старый граф, вдруг принявшись за дело, всё после обеда не переставая ходил со двора в дом и обратно, бестолково крича на торопящихся людей и еще более торопя их. Петя распоряжался на дворе. Соня не знала, что делать под влиянием противоречивых приказаний графа, и совсем терялась. Люди, крича, споря и шумя, бегали по комнатам и двору. Наташа, с свойственной ей во всем страстностью, вдруг тоже принялась за дело. Сначала вмешательство ее в дело укладывания было встречено с недоверием. От нее всё ждали шутки и не хотели слушаться ее; но она с упорством и страстностью требовала себе покорности, сердилась, чуть не плакала, что ее не слушают, и, наконец, добилась того, что в нее поверили. Первый подвиг ее, стоивший ей огромных усилий и давший ей власть, была укладка ковров. У графа в доме были дорогие gobelins и персидские ковры. Когда Наташа взялась за дело, в зале стояли два ящика открытые: один почти доверху уложенный фарфором, другой с коврами. Фарфора было еще много наставлено на столах и еще всё несли из кладовой. Надо было начинать новый, третий ящик, и за ним пошли люди.","After dinner, all the Rostov households with enthusiastic haste set to work packing their things and preparing for departure. The old count, suddenly set to work, after dinner did not stop walking from the yard to the house and back, stupidly shouting at the people in a hurry and hurrying them even more. Petya was in charge in the yard. Sonya did not know what to do under the influence of the count's conflicting orders, and was completely at a loss. People, shouting, arguing and making noise, ran around the rooms and the yard. Natasha, with her characteristic passion in everything, suddenly also set to work. At first, her intervention in the matter of packing was met with disbelief. Everyone expected a joke from her and did not want to listen to her; but with stubbornness and passion she demanded obedience to herself, became angry, almost wept that they did not listen to her, and finally achieved that they believed in her. Her first feat, which cost her great effort and gave her power, was laying carpets. The count had expensive gobelins and Persian rugs in his house. When Natasha got down to business, there were two open boxes in the hall: one almost to the top with porcelain, the other with carpets. There was still a lot of porcelain set on the tables, and everything was still being carried from the pantry. It was necessary to start a new, third box, and people followed him.","After dinner the whole Rostov household, with enthusiastic haste, got to work packing things and preparing for departure.

"Пьер сунулся к флигелю, но жар был так силен, что он невольна описал дугу вокруг флигеля и очутился подле большого дома, который еще горел только с одной стороны с крыши и около которого кишела толпа французов.

"«Солдатом быть, просто солдатом! — думал Пьер, засыпая. — Войти в эту общую жизнь всем существом, проникнуться тем, что делает их такими. Но как скинуть с себя все это лишнее, дьявольское, все бремя этого внешнего человека? Одно время я мог быть этим. Я мог бежать от отца, как я хотел. Я мог еще после дуэли с Долоховым быть послан солдатом». И в воображении Пьера мелькнул обед в клубе, на котором он вызвал Долохова, и благодетель в Торжке. И вот Пьеру представляется торжественная столовая ложа. Ложа эта происходит в Английском клубе. И кто-то знакомый, близкий, дорогой, сидит в конце стола. Да это он! Это благодетель. «Да ведь он умер? — подумал Пьер. — Да, умер; но я не знал, что он жив. И как мне жаль, что он умер, и как я рад, что он жив опять!» С одной стороны стола сидели Анатоль, Долохов, Несвицкий, Денисов и другие такие же (категория этих людей так же ясно была во сне определена в душе Пьера, как и категория тех людей, которых он называл они), и эти люди, Анатоль, Долохов громко кричали, пели; но из-за их крика слышен был голос благодетеля, неумолкаемо говоривший, и звук его слов был так же значителен и непрерывен, как гул поля сраженья, но он был приятен и утешителен. Пьер не понимал того, что говорил благодетель, но он знал (категория мыслей так же ясна была во сне), что благодетель говорил о добре, о возможности быть тем, чем были они. И они со всех сторон, с своими простыми, добрыми, твердыми лицами, окружали благодетеля. Но они хотя и были добры, они не смотрели на Пьера, не знали его. Пьер захотел обратить на себя их внимание и сказать. Он привстал, но в то же мгновенье ноги его похолодели и обнажились.","“To be a soldier, just a soldier! thought Pierre, falling asleep. “Enter this common life with your whole being, imbued with what makes them so.

Even after the duel with Dolokhov, I could have been sent as a soldier.” And in Pierre's imagination flashed a dinner at the club where he summoned Dolokhov, and a benefactor in Torzhok. And now Pierre is presented with a solemn dining box. This lodge takes place in the English Club. And someone familiar, close, dear, is sitting at the end of the table. Yes it is! This is a benefactor. “Yes, he died? thought Pierre. — Yes, he died; but I didn't know he was alive. And how sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!

Pierre did not understand what the benefactor was saying, but he knew (the category of thoughts was just as clear in the dream) that the benefactor spoke of goodness, of the possibility of being what they were. And they from all sides, with their simple, kind, firm faces, surrounded the benefactor. But although they were kind, they did not look at Pierre, did not know him.

"Для изучения законов истории мы должны изменить совершенно предмет наблюдения, оставить в покое царей, министров и генералов, а изучать однородные, бесконечно-малые элементы, которые руководят массами. Никто не может сказать, насколько дано человеку достигнуть этим путем понимания законов истории; но очевидно, что на этом пути только лежит возможность уловления исторических законов и что на этом пути не положено еще умом человеческим одной миллионной доли тех усилий, которые положены историками на описание деяний различных царей, полководцев и министров и на изложение своих соображений по случаю этих деяний.","In order to study the laws of history, we must completely change the object of observation, leave the kings, ministers and generals alone, and study the homogeneous, infinitesimal elements that guide the masses.

"Между тем в задах свиты императора происходило шепотом взволнованное совещание между его генералами и маршалами. Посланные за депутацией вернулись с известием, что Москва пуста, что все уехали и ушли из нее. Лица совещавшихся были бледны и взволнованны. Не то, что Москва была оставлена жителями (как ни важно казалось это событие), пугало их, но их пугало то, каким образом объявить о том императору, каким образом, не ставя его величество в то страшное, называемое французами ridicule [смешным] положение, объявить ему, что он напрасно ждал бояр так долго, что есть толпы пьяных, но никого больше. Одни говорили, что надо было во что бы то ни стало собрать хоть какую-нибудь депутацию, другие оспаривали это мнение и утверждали, что надо, осторожно и умно приготовив императора, объявить ему правду.","Meanwhile, in the back of the emperor's retinue, an excited conference was taking place in a whisper between his generals and marshals. Those sent for the deputation returned with the news that Moscow was empty, that everyone had left and left it. The faces of those conferring were pale and agitated. Not that Moscow was abandoned by the inhabitants (no matter how important this event seemed) frightened them, but they were frightened by how to announce this to the emperor, how, without putting his majesty in that terrible situation called by the French ridicule [ridiculous] , announce to him that he waited in vain for the boyars for so long that there are crowds of drunks, but no one else. Some said that it was necessary at all costs to collect at least some kind of deputation, others disputed this opinion and argued that it was necessary, having carefully and cleverly prepared the emperor, to declare the truth to him.","Meanwhile at the back of the emperor's suite a worried debate was going on in whispers among his generals and marshals.

Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor should first be carefully and skilfully prepared, and then told the truth."

"До такой степени капитан был наивно и добродушно весел, и целен, и доволен собой, что Пьер чуть-чуть сам не подмигнул, весело глядя на него.

"Больше Яков Алпатыч не настаивал. Он долго управлял народом и знал, что главное средство для того, чтобы люди повиновались, состоит в том, чтобы не показывать им сомнения в том, что они могут не повиноваться.

"— Ваше сиятельство, сюда… куда изволите?.. сюда пожалуйте, — проговорил сзади его дрожащий, испуганный голос. Граф Растопчин не в силах был ничего отвечать и, послушно повернувшись, пошел туда, куда ему указывали. У заднего крыльца стояла коляска. Далекий гул ревущей толпы слышался и здесь. Граф Растопчин торопливо сел в коляску и велел ехать в свой загородный дом в Сокольниках. Выехав на Мясницкую и не слыша больше криков толпы, граф стал раскаиваться. Он с неудовольствием вспомнил теперь волнение и испуг, которые он выказал перед своими подчиненными. «La populace est terrible, elle est hideuse, — думал он по-французски. — Ils sont сошше les loups qu'on ne peut apaiser qu'avec de la chair. [Народная толпа страшна, она отвратительна. Они как волки: их ничем не удовлетворишь, кроме мяса. ] „Граф! один бог над нами!“ — вдруг вспомнились ему слова Верещагина, и неприятное чувство холода пробежало по спине графа Растопчина. Но чувство это было мгновенно, и граф Растопчин презрительно улыбнулся сам над собою. „J'avais d'autres devoirs, — подумал он. — Il fallait apaiser le peuple. Bien d'autres victimes ont peri et perissent pour le bien publique“, [У меня были другие обязанности. Следовало удовлетворить народ. Много других жертв погибло и гибнет для общественного блага. ] — и он стал думать о тех общих обязанностях, которые он имел в отношении своего семейства, своей (порученной ему) столице и о самом себе, — не как о Федоре Васильевиче Растопчине (он полагал, что Федор Васильевич Растопчин жертвует собою для bien publique [общественного блага]), но о себе как о главнокомандующем, о представителе власти и уполномоченном царя. „Ежели бы я был только Федор Васильевич, ma ligne de conduite aurait ete tout autrement tracee, [путь мой был бы совсем иначе начертан, ] но я должен был сохранить и жизнь и достоинство главнокомандующего“.","“Your Excellency, this way… where would you like to go?.. this way, please,” his trembling, frightened voice said from behind. Count Rostopchin was unable to answer anything and, obediently turning around, went where he was directed. There was a carriage on the back porch. The distant rumble of the roaring crowd was heard here too. Count Rostopchin hurriedly got into the carriage and ordered to go to his country house in Sokolniki. Having left for Myasnitskaya and not hearing the cries of the crowd anymore, the count began to repent. He now recalled with displeasure the excitement and fear he had shown to his subordinates. ""La populace est terrible, elle est hideuse,"" he thought in French. — Ils sont les loups qu'on ne peut apaiser qu'avec de la chair. [The crowd is terrible, it is disgusting. They are like wolves: you can't satisfy them with anything but meat. ] „Count! one god is above us!' He suddenly remembered Vereshchagin's words, and an unpleasant feeling of cold ran down Count Rostopchin's back. But this feeling was instantaneous, and Count Rostopchin smiled contemptuously over himself. J'avais d'autres devoirs, he thought. — Il fallait apaiser le peuple. Bien d'autres victimes ont peri et perissent pour le bien publique“, [I had other duties. The people had to be satisfied. Many other victims have died and are dying for the public good. ] - and he began to think of those general duties that he had in relation to his family, his (entrusted to him) capital and about himself - not as Fyodor Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he believed that Fyodor Vasilyevich Rostopchin sacrificed himself for the bien publique [public good]), but about himself as a commander in chief, a representative of authority and an authorized representative of the king. “If I were only Fyodor Vasilievich, ma ligne de conduite aurait ete tout autrement tracee, [my path would have been drawn in a completely different way,] but I had to save both the life and dignity of the commander in chief.”","“Your Excellency, this way ... Where are you going? ... This way, please,” a trembling, frightened voice said behind him. Count Rastopchin was unable to make any reply and, turning obediently, went where he was told. A caleche was standing by the back entrance. The distant noise of the roaring crowd was heard there, too. Count Rastopchin hurriedly got into the caleche and ordered that he be taken to his country house in Sokolniki. Driving out to Myasnit-skaya and no longer hearing the cries of the crowd, the count began to have regrets. He now recalled with displeasure the agitation and fear he had shown before his subordinates. “La populace est terrible, elle est hideuse,” he thought in French. “Ils sont comme les loups qu'on ne peut apaiser qu'avec de la chair. ” [553]“Count! there is one God over us!” he suddenly remembered Vereshchagin's words, and an unpleasant sensation of chill ran down Count Rastopchin's spine. But the sensation was momentary, and Count Rastopchin smiled scornfully at himself, “j'avais d'autres devoirs” he thought. “Il fallait apaiser le peuple. Bien d'autres victimes ont peri et perissent pour le bien publique,”[554] and he began to think about those general responsibilities he had in relation to his family , to his (entrusted to him) capital, and about himself— not as Fyodor Vassilievich Rastopchin (he supposed that Fyodor Vassilievich Rastopchin had sacrificed himself for the bien publique), but as commander in chief, representative of the authorities, and the tsar's plenipotentiary. “If I were merely Fyodor Vassilievich, ma ligne de conduite aurait été tout autrement tracée,[555] but I had to preserve the life and dignity of the commander in chief.”","‘This way, your Excellency … Where are you going? … This way, please …’ said a trembling, frightened voice behind him. Count Rastopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calèche. The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sokolniki. When they reached the Myasnitsky Street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates. ‘ La populace est terrible, elle est hideuse,’ he said to himself in French. ‘ Ils sont comme les loups qu’on ne peut apaiser qu’avec de la chair. ’1 ‘Count! One God is above us both!’—Vereshchagin ’s words suddenly recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only a momentary feeling and Count Rastopchin smiled disdainfully at himself. ‘ J’avais d’autres devoirs,’ thought he. ‘ Il fallait apaiser le peuple. Bien d’autres victimes ont péri et périssent pour le bien publique’2—and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself—not himself as Fyodor Vasilievich Rastopchin (he fancied that Fyodor Vasilievich Rastopchin was sacrificing himself pour le bien publique) but himself as Governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar. ‘Had I been simply Fyodor Vasilievich ma ligne de conduite aurait été tout autrement tracée,3 but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as Commander-in-Chief.’"
"Физическое состояние Пьера, как и всегда это бывает, совпадало с нравственным. Непривычная грубая пища, водка, которую он пил эти дни, отсутствие вина и сигар, грязное, неперемененное белье, наполовину бессонные две ночи, проведенные на коротком диване без постели, — все это поддерживало Пьера в состоянии раздражения, близком к помешательству.","The physical condition of Pierre, as always happens, coincided with the moral.

"Паулучи, не знавший по-немецки, стал спрашивать его по-французски.

Он беспрестанно иронически смеялся, доказывал и, наконец, презрительно бросил доказывать, как бросает математик поверять различными способами раз доказанную верность задачи. Вольцоген заменил его, продолжая излагать по-французски его мысли и изредка говоря Пфулю: «Nicht wahr, Exellenz?» [Не правда ли, ваше превосходительство?

"В окрестности Богучарова были всё большие села, казенные и оброчные помещичьи. Живущих в этой местности помещиков было очень мало; очень мало было также дворовых и грамотных, и в жизни крестьян этой местности были заметнее и сильнее, чем в других, те таинственные струи народной русской жизни, причины и значение которых бывают необъяснимы для современников. Одно из таких явлений было проявившееся лет двадцать тому назад движение между крестьянами этой местности к переселению на какие-то теплые реки. Сотни крестьян, в том числе и богучаровские, стали вдруг распродавать свой скот и уезжать с семействами куда-то на юго-восток. Как птицы летят куда-то за моря, стремились эти люди с женами и детьми туда, на юго-восток, где никто из них не был. Они поднимались караванами, поодиночке выкупались, бежали, и ехали, и шли туда, на теплые реки. Многие были наказаны, сосланы в Сибирь, многие с холода и голода умерли по дороге, многие вернулись сами, и движение затихло само собой так же, как оно и началось без очевидной причины. Но подводные струи не переставали течь в этом народе и собирались для какой-то новой силы, имеющей проявиться так же странно, неожиданно и вместе с тем просто, естественно и сильно. Теперь, в 1812-м году, для человека, близко жившего с народом, заметно было, что эти подводные струи производили сильную работу и были близки к проявлению.","In the vicinity of Bogucharov there were more and more large villages, state-owned and quitrent landlords. There were very few landowners living in this area; there were also very few serfs and literates, and in the life of the peasants of this area were more noticeable and stronger than in others, those mysterious jets of Russian folk life, the causes and significance of which are inexplicable to contemporaries. One of these phenomena was the movement between the peasants of this area, which manifested itself about twenty years ago, towards resettlement on some kind of warm rivers. Hundreds of peasants, including Bogucharov's, suddenly began to sell their livestock and leave with their families somewhere to the southeast. Like birds flying somewhere beyond the seas, these people with their wives and children strove to go there, to the southeast, where none of them had been. They went up in caravans, bathed one by one, ran, and rode, and went there, to the warm rivers. Many were punished, exiled to Siberia, many died of cold and starvation on the way, many returned on their own, and the movement died down by itself just as it had begun without an obvious reason. But the underwater streams did not stop flowing in this people and gathered for some new force that could manifest itself just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally and strongly. Now, in 1812, for a person who lived close to the people, it was noticeable that these underwater jets were doing powerful work and were close to manifestation.","The neighborhood of Bogucharovo was all large villages belonging to the crown or to absentee landowners. Very few landowners actually lived there; there were also very few domestic and literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasants in this area there appeared, more noticeably and strongly than in others, those mysterious currents of popular Russian life the causes and meaning of which are inexplicable for contemporaries. One of those phenomena, which had manifested itself among the peasants of that locality twenty years before, was a movement to migrate to some “warm rivers.” Hundreds of peasants, Bogucharovo peasants among them, suddenly began selling their cattle and leaving with their families for somewhere in the southeast. As birds fly somewhere beyond the seas, these people, with their wives and children, made for somewhere there, in the southeast, where none of them had ever been. They made up caravans, bought themselves out one by one, ran away, and drove, and walked there, to the warm rivers. Many were punished, exiled to Siberia, many died on the road of cold and hunger, many came back of themselves, and the movement died down, just as it had begun, without any obvious reason. But the undercurrents never ceased to flow among these people and were gathering some sort of new forces in order to manifest themselves just as strangely and unexpectedly, and at the same time as simply, naturally, and strongly. Now, in the year 1812, it was noticeable for a man living close to the people that these undercurrents were intensely at work and were close to manifesting themselves.","In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quit-rent and could work where they pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighbourhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown ‘warm rivers’. Hundreds of peasants, among them the Bogucharovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families towards the south-east. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to the south-east, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or walked towards the ‘warm rivers’. Many of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now, in 1812, to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption."

"Впечатление, произведенное на Ростова княжной Марьей, было очень приятное.

Он сердился именно потому, что мысль о женитьбе на приятной для него, кроткой княжне Марье с огромным состоянием не раз против его воли приходила ему в голову. Для себя лично Николай не мог желать жены лучше княжны Марьи: женитьба на ней сделала бы счастье графини — его матери, и поправила бы дела его отца; и даже — Николай чувствовал это — сделала бы счастье княжны Марьи. Но Соня? И данное слово? И от этого-то Ростов сердился, когда ему шутили о княжне Болконской.","The impression made on Rostov by Princess Marya was very pleasant.

"В то же мгновение, как он сделал это, все оживление Ростова вдруг исчезло. Офицер упал не столько от удара саблей, который только слегка разрезал ему руку выше локтя, сколько от толчка лошади и от страха. Ростов, сдержав лошадь, отыскивал глазами своего врага, чтобы увидать, кого он победил. Драгунский французский офицер одной ногой прыгал на земле, другой зацепился в стремени. Он, испуганно щурясь, как будто ожидая всякую секунду нового удара, сморщившись, с выражением ужаса взглянул снизу вверх на Ростова. Лицо его, бледное и забрызганное грязью, белокурое, молодое, с дырочкой на подбородке и светлыми голубыми глазами, было самое не для поля сражения, не вражеское лицо, а самое простое комнатное лицо. Еще прежде, чем Ростов решил, что он с ним будет делать, офицер закричал: «Je me rends!» [Сдаюсь!] Он, торопясь, хотел и не мог выпутать из стремени ногу и, не спуская испуганных голубых глаз, смотрел на Ростова. Подскочившие гусары выпростали ему ногу и посадили его на седло. Гусары с разных сторон возились с драгунами: один был ранен, но, с лицом в крови, не давал своей лошади; другой, обняв гусара, сидел на крупе его лошади; третий взлезал, поддерживаемый гусаром, на его лошадь. Впереди бежала, стреляя, французская пехота. Гусары торопливо поскакали назад с своими пленными. Ростов скакал назад с другими, испытывая какое-то неприятное чувство, сжимавшее ему сердце. Что-то неясное, запутанное, чего он никак не мог объяснить себе, открылось ему взятием в плен этого офицера и тем ударом, который он нанес ему.","At the same moment he did this, all the revival of Rostov suddenly disappeared. The officer fell not so much from a blow with a saber, which only slightly cut his arm above the elbow, but from the horse's push and from fear. Rostov, restraining his horse, looked for his enemy with his eyes in order to see whom he had defeated. A French dragoon officer jumped with one foot on the ground, the other caught in the stirrup. He, screwing up his eyes in fear, as if expecting every second a new blow, grimaced, looked up at Rostov with an expression of horror. His face, pale and splattered with mud, blond, young, with a hole in his chin and bright blue eyes, was the most not for a battlefield, not an enemy face, but the simplest face of a room. Even before Rostov had decided what he would do with him, the officer shouted: ""Je me rends!"" [I give up!] He, in a hurry, wanted and could not disentangle his leg from the stirrup, and, without taking his frightened blue eyes off, looked at Rostov. The hussars jumped up and freed his leg and put him on the saddle. Hussars from different sides were busy with the dragoons: one was wounded, but, with his face covered in blood, did not give up his horse; the other, embracing the hussar, sat on the back of his horse; the third climbed, supported by the hussar, onto his horse. Ahead ran, firing, the French infantry. The hussars hastily galloped back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back with the others, experiencing some kind of unpleasant feeling that squeezed his heart. Something obscure, confused, which he could not explain to himself, was revealed to him by the capture of this officer and the blow that he dealt him.","The moment he did this, all Rostov's animation suddenly vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the stroke of the sword, which only cut his arm slightly above the elbow, as from the jolt to his horse and from fear. Reining in his horse, Rostov sought his enemy with his eyes, to see whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping on the ground with one foot, the other being caught in the stirrup. Narrowing his eyes fearfully, as if expecting a new blow any second, he winced, glancing up at Rostov from below with an expression of terror. His face, pale and mud-spattered, fair-haired, young, with a dimple on the chin and light blue eyes, was not at all for the battlefield, not an enemy's face, but a most simple, homelike face. Before Rostov decided what to do with him, the officer cried out: “ Je me rends!”[428] He hurriedly tried but was unable to disentangle his foot from the stirrup, and his frightened, light blue eyes were fixed on Rostov. Some hussars galloped up to him, freed his foot, and sat him in the saddle. Hussars on all sides were busy with the dragoons: one was wounded, but, with his face all covered with blood, refused to surrender his horse; another, his arms around a hussar, sat on his horse's croup; a third, supported by a hussar, was getting on his horse. In front of them, French infantry came running and shooting. The hussars hurriedly galloped away with their prisoners. Rostov galloped away with the others, experiencing some unpleasant feeling which wrung his heart. Something unclear, confused, something he was unable to explain to himself, had been revealed to him in the capture of this officer and the blow he had given him.","The instant he had done this, all Rostov’s animation vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the blow—which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow—as from the shock to his horse and from fright. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostov with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face—fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and light blue eyes—was not an enemy’s face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried, ‘I surrender!’ He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup, and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov’s face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle. On all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his horse; another was perched up behind a hussar with his arms round him; a third was being helped by a hussar to mount his horse. In front the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back with the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him."
"Через неделю князь вышел и начал опять прежнюю жизнь, с особенной деятельностью занимаясь постройками и садами и прекратив все прежние отношения с m-lle Bourienne.

"Генералы Наполеона — Даву, Ней и Мюрат, находившиеся в близости этой области огня и даже иногда заезжавшие в нее, несколько раз вводили в эту область огня стройные и огромные массы войск. Но противно тому, что неизменно совершалось во всех прежних сражениях, вместо ожидаемого известия о бегстве неприятеля, стройные массы войск возвращались оттуда расстроенными, испуганными толпами.

"На прежнем месте ни чиновника, ни его жены уже не было. Пьер быстрыми шагами ходил между народом, оглядывая разные лица, попадавшиеся ему.

Очень молодая женщина эта показалась Пьеру совершенством восточной красоты, с ее резкими, дугами очерченными черными бровями и длинным, необыкновенно нежно-румяным и красивым лицом без всякого выражения. Среди раскиданных пожитков, в толпе на площади, она, в своем богатом атласном салопе и ярко-лиловом платке, накрывавшем ее голову, напоминала нежное тепличное растение, выброшенное на снег. Она сидела на узлах несколько позади старухи и неподвижно-большими черными продолговатыми, с длинными ресницами, глазами смотрела в землю. Видимо, она знала свою красоту и боялась за нее. Лицо это поразило Пьера, и он, в своей поспешности, проходя вдоль забора, несколько раз оглянулся на нее.

The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check, suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow. Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands, rushed towards the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing struggling crowd."
"— Все мысли! об тебе… мысли, — потом выговорил он гораздо лучше и понятнее, чем прежде, теперь, когда он был уверен, что его понимают.

Пьеру не только не удавалось говорить, но его грубо перебивали, отталкивали, отворачивались от него, как от общего врага. Это не оттого происходило, что недовольны были смыслом его речи, — ее и забыли после большого количества речей, последовавших за ней, — но для одушевления толпы нужно было иметь ощутительный предмет любви и ощутительный предмет ненависти.

Pierre not only failed to speak, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed away, turned away from him, as from a common enemy. This did not happen because they were dissatisfied with the meaning of his speech - and it was forgotten after a large number of speeches that followed it - but to inspire the crowd, it was necessary to have a tangible object of love and a tangible object of hatred.

"В исторических сочинениях о 1812-м годе авторы французы очень любят говорить о том, как Наполеон чувствовал опасность растяжения своей линии, как он искал сражения, как маршалы его советовали ему остановиться в Смоленске, и приводить другие подобные доводы, доказывающие, что тогда уже будто понята была опасность кампании; а авторы русские еще более любят говорить о том, как с начала кампании существовал план скифской войны заманивания Наполеона в глубь России, и приписывают этот план кто Пфулю, кто какому-то французу, кто Толю, кто самому императору Александру, указывая на записки, проекты и письма, в которых действительно находятся намеки на этот образ действий. Но все эти намеки на предвидение того, что случилось, как со стороны французов так и со стороны русских выставляются теперь только потому, что событие оправдало их. Ежели бы событие не совершилось, то намеки эти были бы забыты, как забыты теперь тысячи и миллионы противоположных намеков и предположений, бывших в ходу тогда, но оказавшихся несправедливыми и потому забытых. Об исходе каждого совершающегося события всегда бывает так много предположений, что, чем бы оно ни кончилось, всегда найдутся люди, которые скажут: «Я тогда еще сказал, что это так будет», забывая совсем, что в числе бесчисленных предположений были делаемы и совершенно противоположные.","In historical writings about 1812, French authors are very fond of talking about how Napoleon felt the danger of stretching his line, how he was looking for battles, how his marshals advised him to stop in Smolensk, and give other similar arguments proving that then the danger of the campaign was understood; and Russian authors are even more fond of talking about how, from the beginning of the campaign, there was a plan for the Scythian war to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and they attribute this plan to some Pful, some to some Frenchman, some to Tolya, some to Emperor Alexander himself, pointing to notes, projects and letters that do contain hints of this course of action. But all these allusions to the foresight of what happened, both on the part of the French and on the part of the Russians, are now put forward only because the event justified them. If the event had not taken place, then these hints would have been forgotten, just as thousands and millions of opposite hints and assumptions are now forgotten, which were then in use, but turned out to be unjust and therefore forgotten. There are always so many assumptions about the outcome of each occurring event that, no matter how it ends, there will always be people who will say: “I said then that it would be so,” completely forgetting that among the countless assumptions there were made and completely opposite.","In historical writings about the year 1812, French authors like very much to speak of how Napoleon sensed the danger of extending his line, how he sought a battle, how his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk, and to bring forth other similar arguments to prove that even then the danger of the campaign was supposedly understood; and Russian authors like still more to speak of how from the beginning of the campaign there existed a Scythian war plan of luring Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and one ascribes this plan to Pfuel, another to some Frenchman, another to Toll, another to the emperor Alexander himself, pointing to reports, projects, and letters that indeed contain hints at such a way of action. But all these hints at the foreseeing of what happened, both on the part of the French and on the part of the Russians, are now put forward only because events justified them. If the events had not occurred, those hints would have been forgotten, as thousands and millions of contrary hints and suppositions that were current then, but turned out to be incorrect, are now forgotten. There are always so many suppositions about the outcome of every event which takes place that, however it ends, people will always be found who say, “I said back then that it would be like this,” quite forgetting that among the numberless suppositions, there were some that were completely contrary.","In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought a battle, and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk, and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war-plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself—pointing to notes, projects, and letters, which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event, that however it may end there will always be people to say: ‘I said then that it would be so,’ quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect."

"Во время доклада за входной дверью князь Андрей слышал женское шептанье и хрустение женского шелкового платья. Несколько раз, взглянув по тому направлению, он замечал за дверью, в розовом платье и лиловом шелковом платке на голове, полную, румяную и красивую женщину с блюдом, которая, очевидно, ожидала входа главнокомандующего. Адъютант Кутузова шепотом объяснил князю Андрею, что это была хозяйка дома, попадья, которая намеревалась подать хлеб-соль его светлости. Муж ее встретил светлейшего с крестом в церкви, она дома… «Очень хорошенькая», — прибавил адъютант с улыбкой. Кутузов оглянулся на эти слова. Кутузов слушал доклад дежурного генерала (главным предметом которого была критика позиции при Цареве-Займище) так же, как он слушал Денисова, так же, как он слушал семь лет тому назад прения Аустерлицкого военного совета. Он, очевидно, слушал только оттого, что у него были уши, которые, несмотря на то, что в одном из них был морской канат, не могли не слышать; но очевидно было, что ничто из того, что мог сказать ему дежурный генерал, не могло не только удивить или заинтересовать его, но что он знал вперед все, что ему скажут, и слушал все это только потому, что надо прослушать, как надо прослушать поющийся молебен. Все, что говорил Денисов, было дельно и умно. То, что говорил дежурный генерал, было еще дельнее и умнее, но очевидно было, что Кутузов презирал и знание и ум и знал что-то другое, что должно было решить дело, — что-то другое, независимое от ума и знания. Князь Андрей внимательно следил за выражением лица главнокомандующего, и единственное выражение, которое он мог заметить в нем, было выражение скуки, любопытства к тому, что такое означал женский шепот за дверью, и желание соблюсти приличие. Очевидно было, что Кутузов презирал ум, и знание, и даже патриотическое чувство, которое выказывал Денисов, но презирал не умом, не чувством, не знанием (потому что он и не старался выказывать их), а он презирал их чем-то другим. Он презирал их своей старостью, своею опытностью жизни. Одно распоряжение, которое от себя в этот доклад сделал Кутузов, откосилось до мародерства русских войск. Дежурный генерал в конце доклада представил светлейшему к подписи бумагу о взысканий с армейских начальников по прошению помещика за скошенный зеленый овес.","During the report outside the front door, Prince Andrei heard a woman's whispering and the crunch of a woman's silk dress. Several times, looking in that direction, he noticed behind the door, in a pink dress and a purple silk scarf on her head, a plump, ruddy and beautiful woman with a dish, who, obviously, was waiting for the commander-in-chief to enter. Kutuzov's adjutant explained to Prince Andrei in a whisper that it was the mistress of the house, the priest, who intended to serve his lordship's bread and salt. Her husband met the Most Serene with a cross in the church, she is at home ... ""Very pretty,"" the adjutant added with a smile. Kutuzov looked back at these words. Kutuzov listened to the report of the general on duty (the main subject of which was criticism of the position under Tsarev-Zaimishch) just as he listened to Denisov, just as he listened to the debate of the Austerlitz military council seven years ago. He apparently listened only because he had ears which, despite the fact that one of them had a sea rope, could not but hear; but it was obvious that nothing that the general on duty could tell him could not only surprise or interest him, but that he knew in advance everything that was said to him, and listened to all this only because he had to listen, how to listen singing prayer. Everything that Denisov said was sensible and clever. What the general on duty said was even more detailed and smarter, but it was obvious that Kutuzov despised both knowledge and mind and knew something else that was supposed to solve the matter - something else, independent of mind and knowledge. Prince Andrei carefully followed the expression on the commander-in-chief's face, and the only expression that he could notice in it was an expression of boredom, curiosity about what a woman's whisper outside the door meant, and a desire to keep up appearances. It was obvious that Kutuzov despised the mind, and knowledge, and even the patriotic feeling that Denisov showed, but he did not despise the mind, not the feeling, not the knowledge (because he did not try to show them), but he despised them with something else. He despised them with his old age, his experience of life. One order, which Kutuzov made on his own behalf in this report, deviated from the looting of the Russian troops. At the end of the report, the general on duty presented the brightest for signature with a paper about the penalties from the army commanders at the request of the landowner for mowed green oats.","During the report, Prince Andrei heard a woman's whispers and the rustle of a woman's silk dress behind the front door. Several times, glancing in that direction, he noticed behind the door a plump, red-cheeked, and beautiful woman in a pink dress, with a purple silk kerchief on her head, holding a platter and obviously waiting for the commander in chief to come in. Kutuzov's adjutant explained in a whisper to Prince Andrei that she was the mistress of the house, the priest's wife, who intended to meet his serenity with bread and salt.[229] Her husband had met his serenity in church with a cross, and she at home ... “Very pretty,” the adjutant added with a smile. At those words Kutu-zov glanced up. Kutuzov listened to the report of the general on duty (the main subject of which was a critique of the position at Tsarevo-Zaimishche) in the same way as he had listened to Denisov, in the same way as he had listened, seven years earlier, to the debate at the Austerlitz council of war. He obviously listened only because he had ears, which, despite the fact that one of them was stopped up with hemp, could not help listening; but it was obvious not only that he could not be surprised or interested in anything the general on duty could tell him, but that he knew beforehand everything he was being told and listened to it only because he had to listen, as one has to listen to the singing of a prayer service. Everything Denisov had said was practical and intelligent. What the general on duty was saying was still more practical and intelligent, but it was obvious that Kutuzov despised both knowledge and intelligence, and knew something else that was to decide matters—something that did not depend on intelligence and knowledge. Prince Andrei followed attentively the expression of the commander in chief's face, and the only expression he was able to notice on it was one of boredom, of curiosity about the meaning of the woman's whispering behind the door, and of the wish to observe propriety. It was obvious that Kutuzov despised the intelligence, the knowledge, and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but he despised them not with his intelligence, or feeling, or knowledge (for he did not even try to show any), he despised them with something else. He despised them with his old age, with his experience of life. The one order Kutuzov added personally to this report was concerned with looting by Russian troops. At the end of his report, the general on duty presented his serenity with a paper to be signed concerning remuneration by the army commanders, at a landowner's request, for green oats that had been mowed down.","While this was being given, Prince Andrei heard the whisper of a woman’s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander-in-chief. Kutuzov’s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrei that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. ‘Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the house … She’s very pretty,’ added the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutuzov looked round. He was listening to the general ’s report—which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche—as he had listened to Denisov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All that Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the matter—something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrei watched the commander-in-chief’s face attentively, and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge—he did not try to display any of these—but because of something else. He despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation."

"В конце Петровского поста Аграфена Ивановна Белова, отрадненская соседка Ростовых, приехала в Москву поклониться московским угодникам. Она предложила Наташе говеть, и Наташа с радостью ухватилась за эту мысль. Несмотря на запрещение доктора выходить рано утром, Наташа настояла на том, чтобы говеть, и говеть не так, как говели обыкновенно в доме Ростовых, то есть отслушать на дому три службы, а чтобы говеть так, как говела Аграфена Ивановна, то есть всю неделю, не пропуская ни одной вечерни, обедни или заутрени.","At the end of the Petrovsky post, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, the Otradnenskaya neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to bow to the Moscow saints. She invited Natasha to go to bed, and Natasha seized on this idea with joy. Despite the doctor’s prohibition to go out early in the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting, and not fasting as usual in the Rostovs’ house, that is, listening to three services at home, but in order to fast as Agrafena Ivanovna used to, that is, all week without missing a single Vespers, Mass or Matins.","At the end of St. Peter's fast, Agrafena Ivanovna Belov, the Rostovs' neighbor in Otradnoe, came to Moscow to venerate the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha prepare for communion,[202] and Natasha joyfully seized upon the idea. Despite the doctor's prohibition on going out early in the morning, Natasha insisted on preparing, and preparing not as it was usually done in the Rostovs' home, that is, by hearing three services at home, but as Agrafena Ivanovna did it, that is, for the whole week, without missing a single vespers, liturgy, or matins.","Before the end of the fast of St Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, a country neighbour of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha should fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the idea. Despite the doctor’s orders that she should not go out early in the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov family by attending three services in their own house, but as Agrafena Ivanovna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass."
"Алпатыч покачал головой и пошел на лестницу. В приемной были купцы, женщины, чиновники, молча переглядывавшиеся между собой. Дверь кабинета отворилась, все встали с мест и подвинулись вперед.

"— Да, да, — рассеянно сказал князь Андрей. — Одно, что бы я сделал, ежели бы имел власть, — начал он опять, — я не брал бы пленных. Что такое пленные? Это рыцарство.

"Соня чувствовала, что это была правда, что единственная возможность поправления дел Ростовых была женитьба на богатой и что княжна была хорошая партия. Но ей было это очень горько. Несмотря на свое горе или, может быть, именно вследствие своего горя, она на себя взяла все трудные заботы распоряжений об уборке и укладке вещей и целые дни была занята. Граф и графиня обращались к ней, когда им что-нибудь нужно было приказывать. Петя и Наташа, напротив, не только не помогали родителям, но большею частью всем в доме надоедали и мешали. И целый день почти слышны были в доме их беготня, крики и беспричинный хохот. Они смеялись и радовались вовсе не оттого, что была причина их смеху; но им на душе было радостно и весело, и потому все, что ни случалось, было для них причиной радости и смеха. Пете было весело оттого, что, уехав из дома мальчиком, он вернулся (как ему говорили все) молодцом-мужчиной; весело было оттого, что он дома, оттого, что он из Белой Церкви, где не скоро была надежда попасть в сраженье, попал в Москву, где на днях будут драться; и главное, весело оттого, что Наташа, настроению духа которой он всегда покорялся, была весела. Наташа же была весела потому, что она слишком долго была грустна, и теперь ничто не напоминало ей причину ее грусти, и она была здорова. Еще она была весела потому, что был человек, который ею восхищался (восхищение других была та мазь колес, которая была необходима для того, чтоб ее машина совершенно свободно двигалась), и Петя восхищался ею. Главное же, веселы они были потому, что война была под Москвой, что будут сражаться у заставы, что раздают оружие, что все бегут, уезжают куда-то, что вообще происходит что-то необычайное, что всегда радостно для человека, в особенности для молодого.","Sonya felt that this was true, that the only way to improve the affairs of the Rostovs was to marry a rich woman, and that the princess was a good match. But she was very sad about it. In spite of her grief, or perhaps precisely because of her grief, she took upon herself all the difficult cares of the arrangements for cleaning and packing, and was busy all day long. The count and countess turned to her when they needed to order something. Petya and Natasha, on the contrary, not only did not help their parents, but for the most part they annoyed and interfered with everyone in the house. And all day long their running, shouting and causeless laughter were almost audible in the house. They laughed and rejoiced not at all because there was a reason for their laughter; but their hearts were joyful and cheerful, and therefore everything that happened was for them a cause of joy and laughter. Petya was amused because, having left home as a boy, he returned (as everyone told him) a fine man; it was merry because he was at home, because he had come from Belaya Tserkov, where there was no hope of falling into battle any time soon, to Moscow, where they would fight one of these days; and most importantly, cheerful because Natasha, whose spirit he always obeyed, was cheerful. Natasha, on the other hand, was cheerful because she had been sad for too long, and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and she was healthy. She was also cheerful because there was a person who admired her (the admiration of others was that wheel grease that was necessary for her car to move completely freely), and Petya admired her. Most importantly, they were cheerful because the war was near Moscow, that they would fight at the outpost, that they were handing out weapons, that everyone was running away, leaving somewhere, that something extraordinary was happening in general, which is always joyful for a person, especially for young.","Sonya felt that that was true, that the only possibility of mending the Rostovs' affairs was marriage to a rich girl, and the princess was a good match. But she felt very bitter. In spite of her grief, or maybe precisely because of it, she took upon herself all the difficulties of arranging for the storing and packing of things and was busy all day long. The count and countess turned to her when they needed to give some order. Petya and Natasha, on the contrary, not only did not help their parents, but mostly pestered and hindered everyone in the house. And for almost the whole day their running, shouting, and causeless laughter were heard in the house. They laughed and made merry not at all because there was any reason for laughter; but their souls were filled with joy and mirth because for them everything that happened was a cause of joy and laughter. Petya was merry because, having left home a boy, he had returned (so everyone told him) a fine man; he was merry because he was at home, because from Belaya Tserkov, where there was no hope of getting into battle, he had ended up in Moscow, where there would be fighting any day; and above all he was merry because Natasha, whose moods he was always subject to, was merry. Natasha was merry because she had been sad for too long, and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and she was in good health. She was also merry because there was a person who admired her (the admiration of others was that grease for the wheels which was necessary if her machine was to run perfectly freely), and Petya admired her. And above all they were merry because there was war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the city gates, weapons were being distributed, everyone was fleeing, going somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, which is always joyful for a person, especially a young one.","Sonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the Rostovs’ affairs was by Nikolai marrying a rich woman, and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle, and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because Natasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely—and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping—going away somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting, especially to the young."

"Страшный вид поля сражения, покрытого трупами и ранеными, в соединении с тяжестью головы и с известиями об убитых и раненых двадцати знакомых генералах и с сознанием бессильности своей прежде сильной руки произвели неожиданное впечатление на Наполеона, который обыкновенно любил рассматривать убитых и раненых, испытывая тем свою душевную силу (как он думал). В этот день ужасный вид поля сражения победил ту душевную силу, в которой он полагал свою заслугу и величие. Он поспешно уехал с поля сражения и возвратился к Шевардинскому кургану. Желтый, опухлый, тяжелый, с мутными глазами, красным носом и охриплым голосом, он сидел на складном стуле, невольно прислушиваясь к звукам пальбы и не поднимая глаз. Он с болезненной тоской ожидал конца того дела, которого он считал себя причиной, но которого он не мог остановить. Личное человеческое чувство на короткое мгновение взяло верх над тем искусственным призраком жизни, которому он служил так долго. Он на себя переносил те страдания и ту смерть, которые он видел на поле сражения. Тяжесть головы и груди напоминала ему о возможности и для себя страданий и смерти. Он в эту минуту не хотел для себя ни Москвы, ни победы, ни славы. (Какой нужно было ему еще славы?) Одно, чего он желал теперь, — отдыха, спокойствия и свободы. Но когда он был на Семеновской высоте, начальник артиллерии предложил ему выставить несколько батарей на эти высоты, для того чтобы усилить огонь по столпившимся перед Князьковым русским войскам. Наполеон согласился и приказал привезти ему известие о том, какое действие произведут эти батареи.","The terrible sight of the battlefield, covered with corpses and wounded, in combination with the heaviness of the head and with the news of the killed and wounded twenty familiar generals and with the consciousness of the impotence of his formerly strong hand, made an unexpected impression on Napoleon, who usually liked to examine the dead and wounded, thereby testing his mental strength (as he thought). On this day, the terrible view of the battlefield defeated that spiritual strength in which he believed his merit and greatness. He hurriedly left the battlefield and returned to the Shevardinsky barrow. Yellow, swollen, heavy, with cloudy eyes, a red nose and a hoarse voice, he sat on a folding chair, involuntarily listening to the sounds of firing and not raising his eyes. With painful anguish, he awaited the end of the cause, which he considered himself the cause of, but which he could not stop. Personal human feeling for a brief moment prevailed over that artificial phantom of life that he had served for so long. He endured the suffering and death that he saw on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not want for himself either Moscow, or victory, or glory. (What more glory did he need?) The only thing he wanted now was rest, peace and freedom. But when he was at Semyonovskaya height, the chief of artillery suggested that he place several batteries on these heights in order to increase fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon agreed and ordered that news be brought to him about what effect these batteries would produce.","The dreadful sight of the battlefield covered with corpses and wounded, combined with a heaviness of the head, and with the news that twenty generals he knew well had been killed or wounded, and with the awareness of the impotence of his once-strong arm, made an unexpected impression on Napoleon, who ordinarily liked to survey the dead and wounded, thereby testing his inner strength (as he thought). On that day the terrible sight of the battlefield overcame that inner strength, in which he placed his merit and greatness. He hastily left the battlefield and returned to the Shevardino barrow. Yellow, bloated, heavy, with dull eyes, a red nose, and a hoarse voice, he sat on a camp chair, involuntarily listening to the sounds of gunfire and not raising his eyes. With sickly anguish he awaited the end of this action, of which he considered himself the cause, but which he was unable to stop. Personal human feeling for a brief moment got the upper hand over that artificial phantom of life which he had served so long. He transferred to himself the sufferings and death he had seen on the battlefield. The heaviness in his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of his own suffering and death. At that moment he wanted for himself neither Moscow, nor victory, nor glory. (What more glory did he need?) The only thing he wished for now was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he was on the Semyonovskoe heights, the artillery commander had suggested placing several batteries on those heights to increase the fire on the Russian troops crowding before Knyazkovo.

This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the Shevardino knoll, where he sat on his camp stool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself.

"Предположения о сознании Наполеоном опасности растяжения линии и со стороны русских — о завлечении неприятеля в глубь России — принадлежат, очевидно, к этому разряду, и историки только с большой натяжкой могут приписывать такие соображения Наполеону и его маршалам и такие планы русским военачальникам. Все факты совершенно противоречат таким предположениям. Не только во все время войны со стороны русских не было желания заманить французов в глубь России, но все было делаемо для того, чтобы остановить их с первого вступления их в Россию, и не только Наполеон не боялся растяжения своей линии, но он радовался, как торжеству, каждому своему шагу вперед и очень лениво, не так, как в прежние свои кампании, искал сражения.","Assumptions about Napoleon's consciousness of the danger of stretching the line on the part of the Russians - about luring the enemy into the depths of Russia - obviously belong to this category, and historians can only with great reserve attribute such considerations to Napoleon and his marshals and such plans to Russian military leaders. All facts completely contradict such assumptions. Not only throughout the war, the Russians had no desire to lure the French into the depths of Russia, but everything was done to stop them from their first entry into Russia, and not only Napoleon was not afraid of stretching his line, but he was glad how triumph, every step forward and very lazily, not like in his previous campaigns, he looked for battles.","The suppositions about Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending his line and, on the Russian side, about luring the enemy into the depths of Russia, obviously belong to this category, and it is only by greatly stretching a point that historians can ascribe such considerations to Napoleon and his marshals and such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts completely contradict such suppositions. Not only was there no wish on the Russian side, during the whole time of the war, to lure the French into the depths of Russia, but everything was done to stop them from the moment of their entry into Russia; and not only was Napoleon not afraid of extending his line, but he rejoiced, as at a triumph, at his every step forward, and was very lazy, not as in his previous campaigns, in seeking a battle.","Conjectures as to Napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his line, and as to the Russians’ deliberately luring the enemy into the depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction of such conjectures. During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia, everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph, and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily."

Огромная толпа с открытыми головами офицеров, солдат, ополченцев окружала икону. Позади священника и дьячка, на очищенном месте, стояли чиновные люди. Один плешивый генерал с Георгием на шее стоял прямо за спиной священника и, не крестясь (очевидно, немец), терпеливо дожидался конца молебна, который он считал нужным выслушать, вероятно, для возбуждения патриотизма русского народа. Другой генерал стоял в воинственной позе и потряхивал рукой перед грудью, оглядываясь вокруг себя. Между этим чиновным кружком Пьер, стоявший в толпе мужиков, узнал некоторых знакомых; но он не смотрел на них: все внимание его было поглощено серьезным выражением лиц в этой толпе солдат и оиолченцев, однообразно жадно смотревших на икону. Как только уставшие дьячки (певшие двадцатый молебен) начинали лениво и привычно петь: «Спаси от бед рабы твоя, богородице», и священник и дьякон подхватывали: «Яко вси по бозе к тебе прибегаем, яко нерушимой стене и предстательству», — на всех лицах вспыхивало опять то же выражение сознания торжественности наступающей минуты, которое он видел под горой в Можайске и урывками на многих и многих лицах, встреченных им в это утро; и чаще опускались головы, встряхивались волоса и слышались вздохи и удары крестов по грудям.","Having ascended the mountain, the icon stopped; the people holding the icon on towels changed, the deacons lit the censer again, and a prayer service began. The hot rays of the sun beat down sheer from above; a weak, fresh breeze played with the hair of open heads and the ribbons with which the icon was removed; the singing resounded softly in the open air. A huge crowd with open heads of officers, soldiers, militias surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and the deacon, in the cleared place, stood officials. One bald general with George around his neck stood right behind the priest and, without crossing himself (obviously a German), patiently waited for the end of the prayer service, which he considered it necessary to listen to, probably to excite the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a warlike pose and shook his hand in front of his chest, looking around him. Between this official circle, Pierre, standing in a crowd of peasants, recognized some acquaintances; but he did not look at them: all his attention was absorbed by the serious expression on the faces of this crowd of soldiers and militants, monotonously greedily looking at the icon. As soon as the tired deacons (who sang the twentieth prayer service) began to lazily and habitually sing: “Save your servant from troubles, the Mother of God,” and the priest and deacon picked up: “For we all come running to you, like an indestructible wall and intercession,” at all faces flashed again the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the coming minute, which he saw under the mountain in Mozhaisk and in fits and starts on many, many faces he met that morning; and more often heads drooped, hair was shaken, and sighs and blows of crosses on the breasts were heard.","Having come up the hill, the icon stopped; the people who were holding the icon on towels were replaced, the servers lit the censers, and the prayer service began. The sun's hot rays beat down vertically from above; a faint, fresh breeze played with the hair of the bared heads and the ribbons that decorated the icon; the singing sounded subdued under the open sky. A huge crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and the deacon, on a cleared space, stood men of higher rank. One bald general with a St. George on his neck stood directly behind the priest's back and, not crossing himself (obviously a German), waited patiently for the end of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear out, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial pose and kept fluttering his hand in front of his chest, glancing around. Among this high-ranking circle, Pierre, who was standing in the crowd of muzhiks, recognized some acquaintances; but he was not looking at them: his whole attention was absorbed by the serious expression of the faces in this crowd of soldiers and militiamen who gazed with uniform eagerness at the icon. As soon as the weary servers (who were singing their twentieth prayer service) began lazily and habitually to sing: “Deliver thy servants from affliction, O Mother of God,” and the priest and deacon picked up: “For in God we flee unto thee as a steadfast wall and intercessor”—all the faces lit up again with the same expression of awareness of the solemnity of the present moment that he had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill in Mozhaisk and had glimpsed on many, many faces he had met that morning: heads were bowed more frequently, hair was tossed, and sighs and the thump of crossings on breasts were heard.","At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others, the chanters relit their censers and service began. The hot rays of the sun beat down vertically, and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon. The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities, on a spot reserved for them. A bald general with a St George’s Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest’s back, and without crossing himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not look at them—his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: ‘Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of God,’ and the priest and deacon chimed in: ‘For to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,’ there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozhaisk, and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard."
"Растопчин, ни слова не отвечая, встал и быстрыми шагами направился в свою роскошную светлую гостиную, подошел к двери балкона, взялся за ручку, оставил ее и перешел к окну, из которого виднее была вся толпа. Высокий малый стоял в передних рядах и с строгим лицом, размахивая рукой, говорил что-то. Окровавленный кузнец с мрачным видом стоял подле него. Сквозь закрытые окна слышен был гул голосов.","Rostopchin, without answering a word, got up and with quick steps went to his luxurious bright living room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle, left it and went to the window, from which the whole crowd was visible. A tall fellow stood in the front rows and with a stern face, waving his hand, said something. The bloodied blacksmith stood beside him with a gloomy look. Through the closed windows a murmur of voices could be heard.","Rastopchin, without a word of reply, stood up and with quick steps headed for his bright, luxurious drawing room, went to the door of the balcony, took hold of the handle, let go again, and went to the window, from which the whole crowd was better seen.

Through the closed windows came the noise of voices.","Without saying a word Rastopchin rose and walked hastily to his light luxurious drawing-room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd.

A drone of voices was audible through the closed window."
"«Да, теперь тебе удобно любоваться вечером! Его уж нет, и никто тебе не помешает», — сказала она себе, и, опустившись на стул, она упала головой на подоконник.","“Yes, now it’s convenient for you to admire in the evening! He is gone, and no one will bother you, ”she said to herself, and, sinking into a chair, she dropped her head on the windowsill.","“Yes, it's easy for you to admire the evening now! He's gone, and nobody will hinder you,” she said to herself and, sinking onto a chair, let her head drop to the windowsill.","‘Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now!

"— Свет увидали, ваше сиятельство, как светлейший поступил, — робко и беспрестанно оглядываясь на своего полкового командира, сказал Тимохин.","“They saw the light, your excellency, how the brightest acted,” said Timokhin, timidly and constantly looking back at his regimental commander.","“Light has shone on us, Your Excellency, since his serenity took over,” Tim-okhin said timidly, glancing continually at his regimental commander.","‘We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed,* your Excellency,’ said Timokhin, timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel."
"Дело же, очевидно, было так: позиция была избрана по реке Колоче, пересекающей большую дорогу не под прямым, а под острым углом, так что левый фланг был в Шевардине, правый около селения Нового и центр в Бородине, при слиянии рек Колочи и Войны. Позиция эта, под прикрытием реки Колочи, для армии, имеющей целью остановить неприятеля, движущегося по Смоленской дороге к Москве, очевидна для всякого, кто посмотрит на Бородинское поле, забыв о том, как произошло сражение.","The case, obviously, was like this: the position was chosen along the Kolocha River, which crossed the main road not at a straight line, but at an acute angle, so that the left flank was in Shevardin, the right flank was near the village of Novy and the center was in Borodino, at the confluence of the Kolocha and Voina rivers. . This position, under the cover of the Kolocha River, for the army, whose goal is to stop the enemy moving along the Smolensk road to Moscow, is obvious to anyone who looks at the Borodino field, forgetting how the battle took place.","This is evidently how it was: a position was chosen along the river Kolocha, which crossed the high road not at a right angle but at an acute angle, so that the left flank was in Shevardino, the right near the village of Novoe, and the center in Borodino, by the confluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voyna. For an army that aims at stopping the enemy from moving down the Smolensk road towards Moscow, this position, under cover of the river Kolocha, is obvious to anyone who looks over the field of Borodino forgetting how the battle took place.","The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river Kolocha—which crosses the high road not at a right angle but at an acute angle—so that the left flank was at Shevardino, the right flank near the village of Novoe, and the centre at Borodino at the confluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voina. To any one who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk road to Moscow."
"Ополченец в присутствии Пьера был уже не так caustique, и в лице его выразилось недоуменье к тому, что означала улыбка Жюли. Несмотря на свою рассеянность и добродушие, личность Пьера прекращала тотчас же всякие попытки на насмешку в его присутствии.","The militia in the presence of Pierre was no longer so caustique, and his face expressed bewilderment at what Julie's smile meant. Despite his distraction and good nature, Pierre's personality immediately stopped all attempts at ridicule in his presence.","In Pierre's presence, the militiaman was no longer so caustique, and his face showed perplexity over the meaning of Julie's smile.

"Он говорил, что нынче народ разбирал оружие в Кремле, что в афише Растопчина хотя и сказано, что он клич кликнет дня за два, но что уж сделано распоряжение наверное о том, чтобы завтра весь народ шел на Три Горы с оружием, и что там будет большое сражение.","He said that today the people were dismantling weapons in the Kremlin, that although Rostopchin’s poster said that he would call the cry in two days, but that an order had probably been made that tomorrow all the people would go to the Three Mountains with weapons, and that there there will be a big fight.","He said that weapons had been distributed to the people that day in the Kremlin, that, though Rastopchin's poster had said he would give the call two days beforehand, the orders had certainly already been given that all the people should go to the Three Hills tomorrow with their weapons, and a major battle would take place there.","He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and that though Rastopchin’s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle there."
"Когда он вернулся назад в комнату, Пьер сидел на том же месте, где он сидел прежде, опустив руки на голову. Лицо его выражало страдание. Он действительно страдал в эту минуту. Когда капитан вышел и Пьер остался один, он вдруг опомнился и сознал то положение, в котором находился. Не то, что Москва была взята, и не то, что эти счастливые победители хозяйничали в ней и покровительствовали ему, — как ни тяжело чувствовал это Пьер, не это мучило его в настоящую минуту. Его мучило сознание своей слабости. Несколько стаканов выпитого вина, разговор с этим добродушным человеком уничтожили сосредоточенно-мрачное расположение духа, в котором жил Пьер эти последние дни и которое было необходимо для исполнения его намерения. Пистолет, и кинжал, и армяк были готовы, Наполеон въезжал завтра. Пьер точно так же считал полезным и достойным убить злодея; но он чувствовал, что теперь он не сделает этого. Почему? — он не знал, но предчувствовал как будто, что он не исполнит своего намерения. Он боролся против сознания своей слабости, но смутно чувствовал, что ему не одолеть ее, что прежний мрачный строй мыслей о мщенье, убийстве и самопожертвовании разлетелся, как прах, при прикосновении первого человека.","When he returned back to the room, Pierre was sitting in the same place where he had sat before, his hands on his head. His face showed pain. He really suffered at that moment. When the captain left and Pierre was left alone, he suddenly came to his senses and realized the position in which he was. Not that Moscow was taken, and not that these happy victors were hosts in it and patronized him - no matter how hard Pierre felt this, it was not this that tormented him at the present moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his weakness. A few glasses of drunk wine, a conversation with this good-natured man destroyed the concentrated and gloomy mood in which Pierre lived these last days and which was necessary for the fulfillment of his intention. The pistol, and the dagger, and the coat were ready, Napoleon was moving in tomorrow. Pierre in the same way considered it useful and worthy to kill the villain; but he felt that now he would not do it. Why? He did not know, but he seemed to have a presentiment that he would not fulfill his intention. He fought against the consciousness of his weakness, but vaguely felt that he could not overcome it, that the former gloomy structure of thoughts about revenge, murder and self-sacrifice scattered like dust at the touch of the first person.","When he came back to the room, Pierre was sitting in the same place as before, his head lowered in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He was indeed suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and Pierre was left alone, he suddenly came to his senses and realized the position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken, and not that these happy victors were playing the masters in it and patronizing him—painful as it felt to Pierre, that was not what tormented him at the present moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The several glasses of wine he had drunk, the conversation with this good-natured man, had destroyed the concentratedly grim state of mind in which Pierre had lived for those last days, and which was necessary for the carrying out of his intention. The pistol, and the dagger, and the peasant coat were ready; Napoleon would enter tomorrow. Pierre still considered it just as useful and worthy to kill the villain; but he felt that now he would not do it. Why? He did not know, but it was as if he had a presentiment that he would not carry out his intention, He struggled against the consciousness of his weakness, but he dimly sensed that he would not overcome it, that his former grim way of thinking about revenge, murder, and self-sacrifice had fallen into dust at the first contact with a human being.","When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as before, with his head in his hands.

Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evil-doer, but he now felt that he would not do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met."

"— Но вам это неправильно доносят, — сказал Пьер. — В городе все тихо, и опасности никакой нет.

"В клубе, в угловой комнате, собирались читать эти афиши, и некоторым нравилось, как Карпушка подтрунивал над французами, говоря, что они от капусты раздуются, от каши перелопаются, от щей задохнутся, что они все карлики и что их троих одна баба вилами закинет. Некоторые не одобряли этого тона и говорила, что это пошло и глупо. Рассказывали о том, что французов и даже всех иностранцев Растопчин выслал из Москвы, что между ними шпионы и агенты Наполеона; но рассказывали это преимущественно для того, чтобы при этом случае передать остроумные слова, сказанные Растопчиным при их отправлении. Иностранцев отправляли на барке в Нижний, и Растопчин сказал им: «Rentrez en vous meme, entrez dans la barque et n'en faites pas une barque ne Charon». [войдите сами в себя и в эту лодку и постарайтесь, чтобы эта лодка не сделалась для вас лодкой Харона. ] Рассказывали, что уже выслали из Москвы все присутственные места, и тут же прибавляли шутку Шиншина, что за это одно Москва должна быть благодарна Наполеону. Рассказывали, что Мамонову его полк будет стоить восемьсот тысяч, что Безухов еще больше затратил на своих ратников, но что лучше всего в поступке Безухова то, что он сам оденется в мундир и поедет верхом перед полком и ничего не будет брать за места с тех, которые будут смотреть на него.","In the club, in the corner room, they were going to read these posters, and some people liked how Karpushka taunted the French, saying that they would bloat from cabbage, burst from porridge, choke on cabbage soup, that they were all dwarfs and that one woman would throw pitchforks on three of them . Some disapproved of this tone and said that it was vulgar and stupid. It was said that Rostopchin had expelled the French and even all foreigners from Moscow, that between them were spies and agents of Napoleon; but they told it mainly in order, on this occasion, to convey the witty words spoken by Rostopchin at their departure. Foreigners were sent on a barge to Nizhny, and Rostopchin told them: ""Rentrez en vous meme, entrez dans la barque et n'en faites pas une barque ne Charon."" [go into yourself and into this boat and try not to let this boat become Charon's boat for you. ] They said that they had already expelled all government offices from Moscow, and immediately added Shinshin's joke that Moscow should be grateful to Napoleon for this alone.

Some disapproved of this tone and said it was banal and stupid. It was said that Rastopchin had banished all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow, that there were spies and agents of Napoleon among them; but this was said primarily in order to have an occasion to repeat the witticism Rastopchin had produced as they were being sent away. The foreigners were sent by barge to Nizhny, and Rastopchin said to them: “Rentrez en vous-même, entrez dans la barque et n'en faites pas une barque de Charon. ”[455][234] It was said that all the government offices had already been sent away from Moscow, and at once Shinshin's joke was added, that for that alone people should be grateful to Napoleon. The story went that Mamonov's regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand, that Bezukhov had spent still more on his militia, but that the best thing about Bezukhov's actions was that he was going to put on a uniform himself and ride at the head of his regiment, and charge no admission for those who wanted to look at him.","In the corner room at the club, members gathered to read these broad-sheets and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French, saying: ‘They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our buck-wheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage-soup.

It was said that Rastopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among them, but this was told chiefly to introduce Rastopchin’s witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nizhny by boat, and Rastopchin had said to them in French: ‘Rentrez en vous-même, entrez dans la barque et n’en faites pas une barque de Charon. ’1 There was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this Shinshin’s witticism was added—that for that alone Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamonov’s regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezukhov had spent even more on his, but the best thing about Bezukhov’s action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show."
"На крыльце и на дворе уезжавшие люди с кинжалами и саблями, которыми их вооружил Петя, с заправленными панталонами в сапоги и туго перепоясанные ремнями и кушаками, прощались с теми, которые оставались.","On the porch and in the yard, people leaving with daggers and sabers with which Petya armed them, with trousers tucked into boots and tightly belted with belts and sashes, said goodbye to those who remained.","On the porch and in the courtyard, the servants who were leaving, armed by Petya with daggers and swords, their trousers tucked into their boots, and tightly girded with belts and sashes, were saying good-bye to those who were staying.","In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind."
"В начальствовании армией были две резкие, определенные партии: партия Кутузова и партия Бенигсена, начальника штаба. Борис находился при этой последней партии, и никто так, как он, не умел, воздавая раболепное уважение Кутузову, давать чувствовать, что старик плох и что все дело ведется Бенигсеном. Теперь наступила решительная минута сражения, которая должна была или уничтожить Кутузова и передать власть Бенигсену, или, ежели бы даже Кутузов выиграл сражение, дать почувствовать, что все сделано Бенигсеном. Во всяком случае, за завтрашний день должны были быть розданы большие награды и выдвинуты вперед новые люди. И вследствие этого Борис находился в раздраженном оживлении весь этот день.","There were two sharp, definite parties in command of the army: the party of Kutuzov and the party of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris was with this last game, and no one, like him, was able, paying obsequious respect to Kutuzov, to make it feel that the old man was bad and that the whole thing was being conducted by Benigsen. Now came the decisive moment of the battle, which was to either destroy Kutuzov and transfer power to Bennigsen, or, even if Kutuzov won the battle, make it feel that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case, big awards were to be distributed for tomorrow and new people were to be put forward. And as a result, Boris was in an irritated animation all that day.","In the army's high command there were two clear-cut, well-defined parties: the party of Kutuzov and the party of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris belonged to the latter party, and no one knew so well as he how, while rendering servile respect to Kutuzov, to make it felt that the old man was no good and that everything was being conducted by Bennigsen. Now the decisive moment of battle had come, which should either destroy Kutuzov and hand power over to Bennigsen, or, even if Kutuzov won the battle, make it felt that it had all been done by Bennigsen. In any case, for tomorrow big rewards should be given out and new men brought to the fore. And owing to that, Boris was in nervous animation all that day.","In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutuzov’s party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris belonged to the latter, and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good, and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen.

"Многие историки говорят, что Бородинское сражение не выиграно французами потому, что у Наполеона был насморк, что ежели бы у него не было насморка, то распоряжения его до и во время сражения были бы еще гениальнее, и Россия бы погибла, et la face du monde eut ete changee. [и облик мира изменился бы. ] Для историков, признающих то, что Россия образовалась по воле одного человека — Петра Великого, и Франция из республики сложилась в империю, и французские войска пошли в Россию по воле одного человека — Наполеона, такое рассуждение, что Россия осталась могущественна потому, что у Наполеона был большой насморк 26-го числа, такое рассуждение для таких историков неизбежно последовательно.","Many historians say that the battle of Borodino was not won by the French because Napoleon had a cold, that if he had not had a cold, then his orders before and during the battle would have been even more brilliant, and Russia would have perished, et la face du monde eut ete changee. [and the face of the world would change. ] For historians who admit that Russia was formed at the behest of one person - Peter the Great, and France from a republic developed into an empire, and French troops went to Russia at the behest of one person - Napoleon, such an argument that Russia remained powerful because Napoleon had a big cold on the 26th, such reasoning for such historians is inevitably consistent.","Many historians say that the battle of Borodino was not won by the French because Napoleon had a cold, that if he had not had a cold, his instructions before and during the battle would have been of still greater genius, and Russia would have perished, et la face du monde eut été changée.[481] For historians who accept that Russia was shaped by the will of one man—Peter the Great— and that France was turned from a republic into an empire and French troops went to Russia by the will of one man—Napoleon—such an argument, that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-sixth, such an argument for such historians is inevitably consistent.","MANY historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodino because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and la face du monde eût été changée.1 To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man—Peter the Great—and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man—Napoleon—to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the 24th of August may seem logical and convincing."
"Русские не делали этого усилия, потому что не они атаковали французов. В начале сражения они только стояли по дороге в Москву, загораживая ее, и точно так же они продолжали стоять при конце сражения, как они стояли при начале его. Но ежели бы даже цель русских состояла бы в том, чтобы сбить французов, они не могли сделать это последнее усилие, потому что все войска русских были разбиты, не было ни одной части войск, не пострадавшей в сражении, и русские, оставаясь на своих местах, потеряли половину своего войска.","The Russians did not make this effort because they did not attack the French. At the beginning of the battle, they only stood on the road to Moscow, blocking it, and in the same way they continued to stand at the end of the battle, as they stood at the beginning of it. But even if the goal of the Russians were to knock down the French, they could not make this last effort, because all the Russian troops were defeated, there was not a single part of the troops that did not suffer in the battle, and the Russians, remaining in their places lost half of their troops.","The Russians did not make that effort, because it was not they who were attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle, they merely stood on the way to Moscow, shielding it, and they went on standing in the same way at the end of the battle as they had at the beginning. But even if the goal of the Russians had consisted in bringing down the French, they could not have made that last effort, because all the Russian troops were battered, there was not a single army unit that had not suffered in the battle, and the Russians, while staying in their places, had lost half their troops.","The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost one-half of their army."

"В 1806-м году Пфуль был одним из составителей плана войны, кончившейся Иеной и Ауерштетом; но в исходе этой войны он не видел ни малейшего доказательства неправильности своей теории.

"Армии раздроблены, нет единства начальства, Барклай не популярен; но из этой путаницы, раздробления и непопулярности немца-главнокомандующего, с одной стороны, вытекает нерешительность и избежание сражения (от которого нельзя бы было удержаться, ежели бы армии были вместе и не Барклай был бы начальником), с другой стороны, — все большее и большее негодование против немцев и возбуждение патриотического духа.","The armies are fragmented, there is no unity of the authorities, Barclay is not popular; but from this confusion, fragmentation and unpopularity of the German commander-in-chief, on the one hand, indecision and avoidance of battle (which could not be resisted if the armies were together and Barclay were not the commander), on the other hand, more and more greater resentment against the Germans and arousal of the patriotic spirit.","The armies are divided, there is no unity of leadership, Barclay is unpopular; but this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the German commander in chief results, on the one hand, in indecision and the avoidance of battle from which it would have been impossible to refrain if the armies had been together and had not had Barclay for commander in chief), and, on the other hand, in a greater and greater indignation against the Germans and the arousing of a patriotic spirit.","The armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign commander-in-chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase of patriotic zeal."

"Когда Пьер, обежав дворами и переулками, вышел назад с своей ношей к саду Грузинского, на углу Поварской, он в первую минуту не узнал того места, с которого он пошел за ребенком: так оно было загромождено народом и вытащенными из домов пожитками. Кроме русских семей с своим добром, спасавшихся здесь от пожара, тут же было и несколько французских солдат в различных одеяниях. Пьер не обратил на них внимания. Он спешил найти семейство чиновника, с тем чтобы отдать дочь матери и идти опять спасать еще кого-то. Пьеру казалось, что ему что-то еще многое и поскорее нужно сделать. Разгоревшись от жара и беготни, Пьер в эту минуту еще сильнее, чем прежде, испытывал то чувство молодости, оживления и решительности, которое охватило его в то время, как он побежал спасать ребенка. Девочка затихла теперь и, держась ручонками за кафтан Пьера, сидела на его руке и, как дикий зверек, оглядывалась вокруг себя. Пьер изредка поглядывал на нее и слегка улыбался. Ему казалось, что он видел что-то трогательно-невинное и ангельское в этом испуганном и болезненном личике.","When Pierre, having run around the yards and lanes, went back with his burden to the Gruzinsky garden, on the corner of Povarskaya, for the first minute he did not recognize the place from which he went for the child: it was so cluttered with people and belongings pulled out of the houses. In addition to Russian families with their belongings, who were fleeing the fire here, there were also several French soldiers in various attire. Pierre ignored them. He was in a hurry to find the official's family in order to give his daughter to his mother and go again to save someone else. It seemed to Pierre that he still had a lot to do and that he needed to do it as soon as possible. Inflamed with heat and running around, Pierre at that moment, even stronger than before, experienced that feeling of youth, revival and determination that seized him while he ran to save the child. The girl calmed down now and, holding on to Pierre's caftan with her hands, sat on his arm and, like a wild animal, looked around herself. Pierre glanced at her from time to time and smiled slightly. It seemed to him that he saw something touchingly innocent and angelic in that frightened and sickly little face.","When Pierre, having run around through courtyards and lanes, got back with his burden to the Gruzinskys' garden at the corner of Povarskaya, he did not at first recognize the place from which he had gone to look for the child, it was so cluttered with people and belongings taken from the house. Besides Russian families with their chattels, escaped from the fire, there were also several French soldiers in various dress. Pierre paid no attention to them.

Flushed from the heat and the running, Pierre at that moment experienced even more strongly than before that feeling of youth, animation, and determination which had taken hold of him as he was running to save the child.

He hurried to find the family of that civil servant, in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child.

He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened sickly little face."

They had nothing left to do but cry “Vive l'Empereur!” and go to fight, in order to find food and rest as victors in Moscow.

"От Шевардинского редута, на котором стоял Наполеон, флеши находились на расстоянии версты, а Бородино более чем в двух верстах расстояния по прямой линии, и поэтому Наполеон не мог видеть того, что происходило там, тем более что дым, сливаясь с туманом, скрывал всю местность. Солдаты дивизии Дессе, направленные на флеши, были видны только до тех пор, пока они не спустились под овраг, отделявший их от флеш. Как скоро они спустились в овраг, дым выстрелов орудийных и ружейных на флешах стал так густ, что застлал весь подъем той стороны оврага. Сквозь дым мелькало там что-то черное — вероятно, люди, и иногда блеск штыков. Но двигались ли они или стояли, были ли это французы или русские, нельзя было видеть с Шевардинского редута.","From the Shevardinsky redoubt, on which Napoleon stood, the fleches were at a distance of a verst, and Borodino was more than two versts in a straight line, and therefore Napoleon could not see what was happening there, especially since the smoke, merging with the fog, hid all terrain. The soldiers of the Desse division, directed at the fleches, were visible only until they descended under the ravine that separated them from the fleches. As soon as they descended into the ravine, the smoke of gun and rifle shots on the flashes became so thick that it covered the entire rise on that side of the ravine. Something black flickered through the smoke - probably people, and sometimes the gleam of bayonets.

The soldiers of Dessaix's division, sent against the flèches, could be seen only until they descended into the gully that separated them from the flèches. As soon as they descended into the gully, the smoke of the cannon and musket fire on the flèches became so thick that it obscured the whole ascent up the other side of the gully. There were glimpses of something black through the smoke— probably men—and an occasional gleam of bayonets. But whether they were moving or standing still, whether they were French or Russian, could not be seen from the Shevardino redoubt.","From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches were a verst away, and it was more than two versts as the crow flies to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.

"— Покажите мне… Ооооо! о! ооооо! — слышался его прерываемый рыданиями, испуганный и покорившийся страданию стон. Слушая эти стоны, князь Андрей хотел плакать. Оттого ли, что он без славы умирал, оттого ли, что жалко ему было расставаться с жизнью, от этих ли невозвратимых детских воспоминаний, оттого ли, что он страдал, что другие страдали и так жалостно перед ним стонал этот человек, но ему хотелось плакать детскими, добрыми, почти радостными слезами.","“Show me… Oooooh! O! ooooh! - heard his groan, interrupted by sobs, frightened and resigned to suffering. Listening to these groans, Prince Andrei wanted to cry. Is it because he was dying without glory, because it was a pity for him to part with his life, or because of these irretrievable childhood memories, or because he suffered, that others suffered, and this man groaned so pitifully before him, but he wanted to cry childish, kind, almost joyful tears.","“Show me ... Oooh! oh! oooh!” his moaning, broken by sobs, was heard, frightened and resigned to his suffering. Hearing those moans, Prince Andrei wanted to weep. Whether it was because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or from those memories of long-lost childhood, or because he was suffering, others were suffering, and this man was moaning so pitifully before him, he wanted to weep childlike, kind, almost joyful tears.","‘Show it me … Oh, ooh … oh! Oh, ooh!’ his frightened moans could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs. Hearing those moans Prince Andrei wanted to weep. Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously—he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy, tears."
"Она отворила дверь, перешагнула порог и ступила на сырую, холодную землю сеней. Обхвативший холод освежил ее. Она ощупала босой ногой спящего человека, перешагнула через него и отворила дверь в избу, где лежал князь Андрей. В избе этой было темно. В заднем углу у кровати, на которой лежало что-то, на лавке стояла нагоревшая большим грибом сальная свечка.","She opened the door, stepped over the threshold and stepped onto the damp, cold ground of the porch. The chill that gripped her refreshed her. She felt the sleeping man with her bare foot, stepped over him and opened the door to the hut where Prince Andrei lay. It was dark in this hut. In the back corner, near the bed, on which something was lying, on a bench stood a tallow candle burnt with a large mushroom.","She opened the door, stepped across the threshold and onto the damp, cold, earthen floor of the front hall.

"— Фю… фю… фю… — засвистал он чуть слышно, въезжая на двор. На лице его выражалась радость успокоения человека, намеревающегося отдохнуть после представительства.

"— Allez donc, il y voit assez, [Э, вздор, он достаточно видит, поверьте. ] — сказал князь Василий своим басистым, быстрым голосом с покашливанием, тем голосом и с покашливанием, которым он разрешал все трудности. — Allez, il y voit assez, — повторил он. — И чему я рад, — продолжал он, — это то, что государь дал ему полную власть над всеми армиями, над всем краем, — власть, которой никогда не было ни у какого главнокомандующего.

"Ростов, не дослушав его, толкнул лошадь, выскакал вперед эскадрона, и не успел он еще скомандовать движение, как весь эскадрон, испытывавший то же, что и он, тронулся за ним. Ростов сам не знал, как и почему он это сделал. Все это он сделал, как он делал на охоте, не думая, не соображая. Он видел, что драгуны близко, что они скачут, расстроены; он знал, что они не выдержат, он знал, что была только одна минута, которая не воротится, ежели он упустит ее. Пули так возбудительно визжали и свистели вокруг него, лошадь так горячо просилась вперед, что он не мог выдержать. Он тронул лошадь, скомандовал и в то же мгновение, услыхав за собой звук топота своего развернутого эскадрона, на полных рысях, стал спускаться к драгунам под гору. Едва они сошли под гору, как невольно их аллюр рыси перешел в галоп, становившийся все быстрее и быстрее по мере того, как они приближались к своим уланам и скакавшим за ними французским драгунам. Драгуны были близко. Передние, увидав гусар, стали поворачивать назад, задние приостанавливаться. С чувством, с которым он несся наперерез волку, Ростов, выпустив во весь мах своего донца, скакал наперерез расстроенным рядам французских драгун. Один улан остановился, один пеший припал к земле, чтобы его не раздавили, одна лошадь без седока замешалась с гусарами. Почти все французские драгуны скакали назад. Ростов, выбрав себе одного из них на серой лошади, пустился за ним. По дороге он налетел на куст; добрая лошадь перенесла его через него, и, едва справясь на седле, Николай увидал, что он через несколько мгновений догонит того неприятеля, которого он выбрал своей целью. Француз этот, вероятно, офицер — по его мундиру, согнувшись, скакал на своей серой лошади, саблей подгоняя ее. Через мгновенье лошадь Ростова ударила грудью в зад лошади офицера, чуть не сбила ее с ног, и в то же мгновенье Ростов, сам не зная зачем, поднял саблю и ударил ею по французу.","Rostov, without listening to him, pushed his horse, galloped ahead of the squadron, and before he had time to command the movement, the whole squadron, experiencing the same thing as he, set off after him. Rostov himself did not know how and why he did it. He did all this, as he did on the hunt, without thinking, without understanding. He saw that the dragoons were close, that they were jumping, upset; he knew that they would not stand it, he knew that there was only one minute that would not return if he missed it. The bullets squealed and whistled so excitedly around him, the horse begged forward so eagerly that he could not stand it. He touched the horse, commanded, and at the same instant, hearing the sound of the clatter of his deployed squadron behind him, at full trot, began to descend to the dragoons downhill. As soon as they went downhill, their gait of the lynx involuntarily turned into a gallop, becoming faster and faster as they approached their lancers and the French dragoons galloping after them. The dragoons were close. The front ones, seeing the hussars, began to turn back, the rear ones to stop. With the feeling with which he rushed across the wolf, Rostov, releasing his bottom in full swing, galloped across the frustrated ranks of the French dragoons. One lancer stopped, one on foot crouched to the ground so as not to be crushed, one horse without a rider got mixed up with the hussars. Almost all the French dragoons galloped back. Rostov, choosing one of them on a gray horse, set off after him. On the way he ran into a bush; a good horse carried him over him, and, barely managing on the saddle, Nikolai saw that in a few moments he would catch up with the enemy whom he had chosen as his target. This Frenchman, probably an officer - according to his uniform, bent over, galloped on his gray horse, urging it on with a saber. A moment later, Rostov's horse struck the officer's horse with its chest, almost knocking it down, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.","Rostov, not hearing him out, nudged his horse, leaped ahead of the squadron, and before he had time to command it to move, the whole squadron, feeling the same as he, set out after him. Rostov did not know himself how and why he was doing it. He did it all as he did at the hunt, not thinking, not reflecting. He saw that the dragoons were near, that they were galloping in disorder; he knew that they would not hold, and he knew that there was only one moment, which would not return if he missed it. Bullets whined and whistled so stirringly around him, his horse strained forward so ardently, that he could not control himself. He spurred his horse, gave the command, and at the same moment, hearing the hoofbeats of his deployed squadron behind him, started down at a full trot towards the dragoons at the foot of the hill. They had barely reached the foot of the hill when their trot involuntarily turned into a gallop, which became faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them. The dragoons were near. The ones in front, seeing the hussars, began to turn back; the ones behind began to slow down. With the feeling with which he raced to intercept a wolf, Rostov, giving his Don horse free rein, galloped to intercept the disordered lines of the French dragoons. One uhlan stopped, one on foot fell to the ground to avoid being crushed, one riderless horse mingled with the hussars. Almost all the French dragoons were galloping away. Rostov, picking himself one on a gray horse, raced after him. On the way he galloped into a bush; the good horse carried him over it, and, barely straightening himself in the saddle, Nikolai saw that in a few seconds he would overtake the enemy he had picked out as his target. The Frenchman—probably an officer, by his uniform—hunched over, was galloping along on his gray horse, urging it on with his saber. A moment later Rostov's horse struck the officer's horse in the rump with its breast, almost knocking it down, and at the same moment Rostov, not knowing why himself, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.","Rostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse, galloped to the front of the squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him. Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons near, and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not withstand an attack—knew there was only that moment, and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go, that he could not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill towards the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing our hussars the foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons’ disordered lines. One uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back. Rostov, picking out one on a grey horse, dashed after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop crouching on his grey horse and urging it on with his sabre. In another moment Rostov’s horse dashed its breast against the hind quarters of the officer’s horse almost knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing why, raised his sabre and struck the Frenchman with it."

"— Ах, да… Я сейчас, сейчас лягу, — сказала Наташа, поспешно раздеваясь и обрывая завязки юбок. Скинув платье и надев кофту, она, подвернув ноги, села на приготовленную на полу постель и, перекинув через плечо наперед свою недлинную тонкую косу, стала переплетать ее. Тонкие длинные привычные пальцы быстро, ловко разбирали, плели, завязывали косу. Голова Наташи привычным жестом поворачивалась то в одну, то в другую сторону, но глаза, лихорадочно открытые, неподвижно смотрели прямо. Когда ночной костюм был окончен, Наташа тихо опустилась на простыню, постланную на сено с края от двери.","“Ah, yes ... I’ll lie down now, now,” said Natasha, hastily undressing and tearing off the strings of her skirts. Throwing off her dress and putting on a jacket, she tucked her legs up, sat down on the bed prepared on the floor and, throwing her short, thin braid over her shoulder, began to weave it. Thin long habitual fingers quickly, deftly took apart, weaved, tied a braid. Natasha's head, with a habitual gesture, turned first to one side, then to the other, but her eyes, feverishly open, fixedly stared straight ahead. When the night costume was over, Natasha quietly sank down on a sheet spread on hay from the edge of the door.","I'll lie down right now,” said Natasha, hastily undressing and tearing the lacings of her petticoat. Having thrown off her dress and put on her night jacket, she sat on the bed that had been prepared for her on the floor, tucking her legs under, and, throwing her thin and not very long braid over her shoulder, began rebraiding it. Her long, thin, accustomed fingers quickly, deftly undid, plaited, and tied up the braid. Natasha's head, with a habitual gesture, turned one way, then the other, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked straight ahead fixedly. When the preparations for the night were over, Natasha slowly lowered herself onto the sheet that covered the straw, on the side nearest the door.","‘Oh, yes … I’ll lie down at once,’ said Natasha, and began hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat. When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing-jacket she sat down with her feet under her, on the bed that had been made up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short braid of hair to the front, and began re-braiding it. Her long, thin, practised fingers rapidly unbraided, re-braided, and tied up the braid. Her head moved from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilette for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door."

"— Извольте идти, я без вас знаю, что делать, — сердито крикнул Растопчин. Он стоял у двери балкона, глядя на толпу. «Вот что они сделали с Россией! Вот что они сделали со мной!» — думал Растопчин, чувствуя поднимающийся в своей душе неудержимый гнев против кого-то того, кому можно было приписать причину всего случившегося. Как это часто бывает с горячими людьми, гнев уже владел им, но он искал еще для него предмета. «La voila la populace, la lie du peuple, — думал он, глядя на толпу, — la plebe qu'ils ont soulevee par leur sottise. Il leur faut une victime, [„Вот он, народец, эти подонки народонаселения, плебеи, которых они подняли своею глупостью! Им нужна жертва“.] — пришло ему в голову, глядя на размахивающего рукой высокого малого.

He stood at the balcony door, looking out at the crowd. “This is what they did to Russia! That's what they did to me!"" thought Rostopchin, feeling uncontrollable anger rising in his soul against someone to whom one could attribute the cause of everything that had happened. As is often the case with hot people, anger already possessed him, but he was still looking for an object for him. “La voila la populace, la lie du peuple,” he thought, looking at the crowd, “la plebe qu'ils ont soulevee par leur sottise. Il leur faut une victime, [“Here it is, people, these scum of the population, the plebeians, whom they raised with their stupidity! They need a sacrifice.'] It occurred to him, looking at the tall fellow waving his hand. And for that very reason it occurred to him that he himself needed this sacrifice, this object for his anger.","“Kindly leave, I know what to do without you,” Rastopchin cried angrily. He stood at the door of the balcony, looking at the crowd. “See what they've done to Russia! See what they've done to me!” Rastopchin thought, feeling an irrepressible wrath rising in his soul against someone to whom he could ascribe the cause of all that was happening. As often happens with hot-tempered people, wrath had already taken hold of him, but he was still seeking an object for it. “La voilà la populace, la lie du peuple,” he thought, looking at the crowd, “la plèbe qu'ils ont soulevée par leur sottise. Il leur faut une victime”[552] occurred to him as he looked at the tall fellow swinging his arm. And it occurred to him precisely because he needed that victim himself, that object for his wrath.","‘You may go. I don’t need you to tell me what to do!’ exclaimed Rastopchin angrily. He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd. ‘This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done with me!’ thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. ‘ La voilà la populace, la lie du peuple,’ he thought as he gazed at the crowd: ‘la plèbe qu’ils ont soulevée par leur sottise. Il leur faut une victime,’1 he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage."

"Более всего из рассказа Пьера поразило капитана то, что Пьер был очень богат, что он имел два дворца в Москве и что он бросил все и не уехал из Москвы, а остался в городе, скрывая свое имя и звание.","What struck the captain most of all from Pierre's story was that Pierre was very rich, that he had two palaces in Moscow, and that he abandoned everything and did not leave Moscow, but remained in the city, hiding his name and rank.","Of all that Pierre told him, the captain was most struck by the fact that Pierre was very rich, that he had two mansions in Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything, and had not left Moscow, but had stayed in the city, concealing his name and rank.","More than anything else in Pierre’s story the captain was impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there concealing his name and station."

"Пьер так задумался, что не расслышал вопроса. Он смотрел то на кавалерийский, повстречавшийся теперь с поездом раненых полк, то на ту телегу, у которой он стоял и на которой сидели двое раненых и лежал один, и ему казалось, что тут, в них, заключается разрешение занимавшего его вопроса. Один из сидевших на телеге солдат был, вероятно, ранен в щеку. Вся голова его была обвязана тряпками, и одна щека раздулась с детскую голову. Рот и нос у него были на сторону. Этот солдат глядел на собор и крестился. Другой, молодой мальчик, рекрут, белокурый и белый, как бы совершенно без крови в тонком лице, с остановившейся доброй улыбкой смотрел на Пьера; третий лежал ничком, и лица его не было видно.

One of the soldiers sitting on the cart was probably wounded in the cheek. His whole head was tied with rags, and one cheek was swollen with a child's head. His mouth and nose were on the side.

"Для князя Андрея прошло семь дней с того времени, как он очнулся на перевязочном пункте Бородинского поля. Все это время он находился почти в постояниом беспамятстве. Горячечное состояние и воспаление кишок, которые были повреждены, по мнению доктора, ехавшего с раненым, должны были унести его. Но на седьмой день он с удовольствием съел ломоть хлеба с чаем, и доктор заметил, что общий жар уменьшился. Князь Андрей поутру пришел в сознание. Первую ночь после выезда из Москвы было довольно тепло, и князь Андрей был оставлен для ночлега в коляске; но в Мытищах раненый сам потребовал, чтобы его вынесли и чтобы ему дали чаю. Боль, причиненная ему переноской в избу, заставила князя Андрея громко стонать и потерять опять сознание. Когда его уложили на походной кровати, он долго лежал с закрытыми глазами без движения. Потом он открыл их и тихо прошептал: «Что же чаю?» Памятливость эта к мелким подробностям жизни поразила доктора. Он пощупал пульс и, к удивлению и неудовольствию своему, заметил, что пульс был лучше. К неудовольствию своему это заметил доктор потому, что он по опыту своему был убежден, что жить князь Андрей не может и что ежели он не умрет теперь, то он только с большими страданиями умрет несколько времени после. С князем Андреем везли присоединившегося к ним в Москве майора его полка Тимохина с красным носиком, раненного в ногу в том же Бородинском сражении. При них ехал доктор, камердинер князя, его кучер и два денщика.","For Prince Andrei, seven days have passed since he woke up at the dressing station in the Borodino field. All this time he was almost in constant unconsciousness. The fever and inflammation of the intestines, which were damaged, according to the doctor who was traveling with the wounded, must have carried him away. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with tea, and the doctor noticed that the general fever had decreased. Prince Andrei regained consciousness in the morning. The first night after leaving Moscow was quite warm, and Prince Andrei was left to sleep in a carriage; but in Mytishchi the wounded man himself demanded to be carried out and to be given tea. The pain caused by being carried to the hut made Prince Andrei moan loudly and lose consciousness again. When they laid him down on the camp bed, he lay with his eyes closed for a long time without moving. Then he opened them and whispered softly: “What about tea?” This memory for the smallest details of life struck the doctor. He felt his pulse and, to his surprise and displeasure, noticed that the pulse was better. To his displeasure, the doctor noticed this because, from his experience, he was convinced that Prince Andrei could not live, and that if he did not die now, he would only die with great suffering some time later. With Prince Andrei they were carrying the major of his regiment, Timokhin, with a red nose, who had joined them in Moscow, wounded in the leg in the same Battle of Borodino. They were accompanied by a doctor, the prince's valet, his coachman and two batmen.","For Prince Andrei seven days had gone by since the time he had come to himself in the dressing station on the field of Borodino. For all that time he had been almost continuously unconscious. In the opinion of the doctor, who accompanied the wounded man, his feverish state and the inflammation of his injured intestines were bound to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with tea, and the doctor observed that his overall fever had gone down. Prince Andrei regained consciousness in the morning. The first night after they left Moscow had been quite warm, and Prince Andrei had been left to spend the night in the calèche; but in Mytishchi the wounded man himself had asked to be taken out and given tea. The pain caused by the transfer to the cottage had made Prince Andrei moan loudly and lose consciousness again. When he had been placed on the camp bed, he lay for a long time with his eyes closed, not moving. Then he opened them and whispered softly: “What about the tea?” This memory of the small details of life struck the doctor. He took his pulse and, to his astonishment and displeasure, noticed that the pulse had improved. The doctor was displeased to notice it, because he was convinced from experience that Prince Andrei could not live and that, if he did not die now, he would die with greater suffering sometime later. Timokhin, the major of his regiment with the little red nose, who had been wounded in the leg at the same battle of Borodino and had joined them in Moscow, was being transported along with Prince Andrei. They were accompanied by the doctor, the prince's valet, his driver, and two orderlies.","SEVEN days had passed since Prince Andrei found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodino.

The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm, and he had remained in the calèche, but at Mytishchy the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp-bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: ‘And the tea?’ His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrei’s pulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. Timokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrei’s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino.

"Только два указателя состояния общества выражали то положение, в котором была Москва: чернь, то есть сословие бедных людей, и цены на предметы. Фабричные, дворовые и мужики огромной толпой, в которую замешались чиновники, семинаристы, дворяне, в этот день рано утром вышли на Три Горы. Постояв там и не дождавшись Растопчина и убедившись в том, что Москва будет сдана, эта толпа рассыпалась по Москве, по питейным домам и трактирам. Цены в этот день тоже указывали на положение дел. Цены на оружие, на золото, на телеги и лошадей всё шли возвышаясь, а цены на бумажки и на городские вещи всё шли уменьшаясь, так что в середине дня были случаи, что дорогие товары, как сукна, извозчики вывозили исполу, а за мужицкую лошадь платили пятьсот рублей; мебель же, зеркала, бронзы отдавали даром.","Only two indicators of the state of society expressed the situation in which Moscow was: the mob, that is, the class of poor people, and the prices of objects. Factory workers, servants and peasants in a huge crowd, in which officials, seminarians, noblemen got involved, on this day, early in the morning, went to the Three Mountains. After standing there and not waiting for Rostopchin and making sure that Moscow would be surrendered, this crowd scattered around Moscow, to drinking houses and taverns. Prices that day also indicated the state of affairs. The prices of weapons, gold, carts and horses kept going up, while the prices of paper money and city things kept going down, so that in the middle of the day there were cases when cabbies took out expensive goods, like cloth, from the floor, and for a peasant horse paid five hundred rubles; furniture, mirrors, bronzes were given away for free.","Only two indicators of the condition of society expressed the state Moscow was in: the mob, that is, the estate of the poor, and the prices of products.

Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing."
"Ежели бы Наполеон не выехал вечером 24-го числа на Колочу и не велел бы тотчас же вечером атаковать редут, а начал бы атаку на другой день утром, то никто бы не усомнился в том, что Шевардинский редут был левый фланг нашей позиции; и сражение произошло бы так, как мы его ожидали. В таком случае мы, вероятно, еще упорнее бы защищали Шевардинский редут, наш левый фланг; атаковали бы Наполеона в центре или справа, и 24-го произошло бы генеральное сражение на той позиции, которая была укреплена и предвидена. Но так как атака на наш левый фланг произошла вечером, вслед за отступлением нашего арьергарда, то есть непосредственно после сражения при Гридневой, и так как русские военачальники не хотели или не успели начать тогда же 24-го вечером генерального сражения, то первое и главное действие Бородинского сражения было проиграно еще 24-го числа и, очевидно, вело к проигрышу и того, которое было дано 26-го числа.","If Napoleon had not left on the evening of the 24th for Kolocha and had not ordered to attack the redoubt immediately in the evening, but had begun the attack the next day in the morning, then no one would have doubted that the Shevardinsky redoubt was the left flank of our position; and the battle would have taken place as we expected it to. In that case, we would probably have defended the Shevardino redoubt, our left flank, even more stubbornly; they would attack Napoleon in the center or on the right, and on the 24th there would be a general battle in the position that was fortified and foreseen. But since the attack on our left flank took place in the evening, following the retreat of our rearguard, that is, immediately after the battle of Gridneva, and since the Russian military leaders did not want or did not have time to start a general battle on the 24th evening, the first and main action The battle of Borodino was lost on the 24th and, obviously, led to the loss of the one that was given on the 26th.","If Napoleon had not ridden out to the Kolocha on the evening of the twenty-fourth and had not ordered an attack on the redoubt that same evening, but had begun the attack the next morning, no one would have questioned that the Shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle would have taken place as we had expected. In that case, we would probably have defended the Shevardino redoubt on our left flank still more tenaciously; we would have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the general battle would have taken place on the twenty-fourth at a position that had been fortified and foreseen. But since the attack on our left flank took place in the evening, following the retreat of our rear guard, that is, immediately after the battle at Gridnevo, and since the Russian commanders did not want or did not manage to begin the general battle that same evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and main action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.","Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the 24th to the Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case we should probably have defended the Shevardino Redoubt—our left flank—still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the centre or on the right, and the general engagement would have taken place on the 25th, on the position we intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rearguard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridnyova), and as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the 24th, the first and chief action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the 24th, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the 26th."

"Проснувшись утром 1-го числа, граф Илья Андреич потихоньку вышел из спальни, чтобы не разбудить к утру только заснувшую графиню, и в своем лиловом шелковом халате вышел на крыльцо.

Действие это было в особенности сильно на Пьера, потому что Пьер вдруг при виде этого пожара почувствовал себя освобожденным от тяготивших его мыслей. Он чувствовал себя молодым, веселым, ловким и решительным. Он обежал флигелек со стороны дома и хотел уже бежать в ту часть его, которая еще стояла, когда над самой головой его послышался крик нескольких голосов и вслед за тем треск и звон чего-то тяжелого, упавшего подле него.","The sound of the crackling and rumble of collapsing walls and ceilings, the whistling and hissing of flames and the lively cries of the people, the sight of hesitating, then frowning thick black, then soaring brightening clouds of smoke with sparkles and sometimes solid, sheaf-like, red, sometimes scaly gold, moving along the walls flames, the feeling of heat and smoke, and the speed of movement produced their usual exciting effect on Pierre from fires.

"От Смоленска войска продолжали отступать. Неприятель шел вслед за ними. 10-го августа полк, которым командовал князь Андрей, проходил по большой дороге, мимо проспекта, ведущего в Лысые Горы. Жара и засуха стояли более трех недель. Каждый день по небу ходили курчавые облака, изредка заслоняя солнце; но к вечеру опять расчищало, и солнце садилось в буровато-красную мглу. Только сильная роса ночью освежала землю. Остававшиеся на корню хлеба сгорали и высыпались. Болота пересохли. Скотина ревела от голода, не находя корма по сожженным солнцем лугам. Только по ночам и в лесах пока еще держалась роса, была прохлада. Но по дороге, по большой дороге, по которой шли войска, даже и ночью, даже и по лесам, не было этой прохлады. Роса не заметна была на песочной пыли дороги, встолченной больше чем на четверть аршина. Как только рассветало, начиналось движение. Обозы, артиллерия беззвучно шли по ступицу, а пехота по щиколку в мягкой, душной, не остывшей за ночь, жаркой пыли. Одна часть этой песочной пыли месилась ногами и колесами, другая поднималась и стояла облаком над войском, влипая в глаза, в волоса, в уши, в ноздри и, главное, в легкие людям и животным, двигавшимся по этой дороге. Чем выше поднималось солнце, тем выше поднималось облако пыли, и сквозь эту тонкую, жаркую пыль на солнце, не закрытое облаками, можно было смотреть простым глазом. Солнце представлялось большим багровым шаром. Ветра не было, и люди задыхались в этой неподвижной атмосфере. Люди шли, обвязавши носы и рты платками. Приходя к деревне, все бросалось к колодцам. Дрались за воду и выпивали ее до грязи.","The troops continued to retreat from Smolensk. The enemy was following them. On August 10, the regiment commanded by Prince Andrei passed along the high road, past the avenue leading to the Bald Mountains. The heat and drought lasted for more than three weeks. Curly clouds moved across the sky every day, occasionally obscuring the sun; but by evening it was clearing again, and the sun was setting in a brownish-red mist. Only heavy dew at night refreshed the earth. The bread remaining on the root burned and spilled out. The swamps have dried up. The cattle roared from hunger, not finding food in the meadows burned by the sun. Only at night and in the forests the dew still held, it was cool. But along the road, along the high road along which the troops marched, even at night, even through the forests, there was no such coolness. The dew was not noticeable on the sandy dust of the road, which was pushed up more than a quarter of an arshin. As soon as it dawned, the movement began. Convoys, artillery silently walked along the hub, and the infantry ankle-deep in soft, stuffy, hot dust that had not cooled down during the night. One part of this sandy dust was kneaded by feet and wheels, the other rose and stood like a cloud over the army, sticking to the eyes, hair, ears, nostrils and, most importantly, the lungs of people and animals moving along this road. The higher the sun rose, the higher the cloud of dust rose, and through this thin, hot dust it was possible to look at the sun, not covered by clouds, with a simple eye. The sun was a big crimson ball. There was no wind, and people were suffocating in this still atmosphere. People walked with handkerchiefs tied around their noses and mouths. Coming to the village, everything rushed to the wells. They fought for water and drank it to the dirt.","From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat. The enemy followed after them. On the tenth of August, the regiment under Prince Andrei's command was going down the high road past the avenue that led to Bald Hills. The heat and drought had lasted for more than three weeks. Every day fleecy clouds crossed the sky, occasionally covering the sun; but towards evening it cleared up again, and the sun set in a reddish brown murk. Only the heavy dews at night refreshed the earth. The standing wheat was scorched and spilled its grains. The swamps dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food in the sun-parched meadows. It was cool only at night and in the woods, while the dew lasted. But on the road, on the high road along which the troops were marching, there was not that coolness even at night and in the woods. There was no dew to be seen on the sandy dust of the road, churned up more than half a foot deep. As soon as dawn broke, movement began. Baggage trains and artillery went noiselessly, sunk to the hubs, and infantry sunk to the ankles in the soft, suffocating, hot dust that did not cool down overnight. Part of this dust was kneaded by feet and wheels, the rest rose and hung in a cloud over the troops, filling the eyes, hair, ears, nostrils, and, above all, the lungs of the men and animals moving along this road. The higher the sun rose, the higher rose the cloud of dust, and through this fine, hot dust one could look with the naked eye at the sun, not covered by clouds. The sun looked like a large crimson ball. There was no wind, and the men suffocated in this unstirring atmosphere. They walked on, tying handkerchiefs over their noses and mouths. When they came to a village, they all rushed to the wells. They fought over the water and drank it down to the mud.","FROM Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.

"Прения продолжались долго, и чем дольше они продолжались, тем больше разгорались споры, доходившие до криков и личностей, и тем менее было возможно вывести какое-нибудь общее заключение из всего сказанного. Князь Андрей, слушая этот разноязычный говор и эти предположения, планы и опровержения и крики, только удивлялся тому, что они все говорили. Те, давно и часто приходившие ему во время его военной деятельности, мысли, что нет и не может быть никакой военной науки и поэтому не может быть никакого так называемого военного гения, теперь получили для него совершенную очевидность истины. «Какая же могла быть теория и наука в деле, которого условия и обстоятельства неизвестны и не могут быть определены, в котором сила деятелей войны еще менее может быть определена? Никто не мог и не может знать, в каком будет положении наша и неприятельская армия через день, и никто не может знать, какая сила этого или того отряда. Иногда, когда нет труса впереди, который закричит: „Мы отрезаны! — и побежит, а есть веселый, смелый человек впереди, который крикнет: «Ура! — отряд в пять тысяч стоит тридцати тысяч, как под Шенграбеном, а иногда пятьдесят тысяч бегут перед восемью, как под Аустерлицем. Какая же может быть наука в таком деле, в котором, как во всяком практическом деле, ничто не может быть определено и все зависит от бесчисленных условий, значение которых определяется в одну минуту, про которую никто не знает, когда она наступит. Армфельд говорит, что наша армия отрезана, а Паулучи говорит, что мы поставили французскую армию между двух огней; Мишо говорит, что негодность Дрисского лагеря состоит в том, что река позади, а Пфуль говорит, что в этом его сила. Толь предлагает один план, Армфельд предлагает другой; и все хороши, и все дурны, и выгоды всякого положения могут быть очевидны только в тот момент, когда совершится событие. И отчего все говорят: гений военный? Разве гений тот человек, который вовремя успеет велеть подвезти сухари и идти тому направо, тому налево? Оттого только, что военные люди облечены блеском и властью и массы подлецов льстят власти, придавая ей несвойственные качества гения, их называют гениями. Напротив, лучшие генералы, которых я знал, — глупые или рассеянные люди. Лучший Багратион, — сам Наполеон признал это. А сам Бонапарте! Я помню самодовольное и ограниченное его лицо на Аустерлицком поле. Не только гения и каких-нибудь качеств особенных не нужно хорошему полководцу, но, напротив, ему нужно отсутствие самых лучших высших, человеческих качеств — любви, поэзии, нежности, философского пытливого сомнения. Он должен быть ограничен, твердо уверен в том, что то, что он делает, очень важно (иначе у него недостанет терпения), и тогда только он будет храбрый полководец. Избави бог, коли он человек, полюбит кого-нибудь, пожалеет, подумает о том, что справедливо и что нет. Понятно, что исстари еще для них подделали теорию гениев, потому что они — власть. Заслуга в успехе военного дела зависит не от них, а от того человека, который в рядах закричит: пропали, или закричит: ура! И только в этих рядах можно служить с уверенностью, что ты полезен!“","The debate went on for a long time, and the longer it went on, the more disputes flared up, reaching shouts and personalities, and the less it was possible to draw any general conclusion from everything that was said. Prince Andrei, listening to this multilingual dialect and these assumptions, plans and denials and cries, was only surprised at what they all said. Those thoughts that had come to him for a long time and often during his military activities, that there is and cannot be any military science and therefore there can be no so-called military genius, now received for him the complete evidence of the truth. “What kind of theory and science could there be in a matter in which the conditions and circumstances are unknown and cannot be determined, in which the strength of the leaders of the war can be even less determined? No one could and cannot know what the position of our and the enemy army will be in a day, and no one can know what the strength of this or that detachment is. Sometimes, when there is no coward in front who will shout: “We are cut off! - and run, and there is a cheerful, courageous person in front who will shout: “Hurrah! - a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Schöngraben, and sometimes fifty thousand run before eight, as at Austerlitz. What kind of science can there be in such a matter, in which, as in any practical matter, nothing can be determined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined in one minute, about which no one knows when it will come. Armfeld says that our army is cut off, and Pauluchi says that we have placed the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in the fact that the river is behind, and Pfuel says that this is his strength. Tol proposes one plan, Armfeld proposes another; and everyone is good, and everyone is bad, and the benefits of any situation can be obvious only at the moment when the event takes place. And why does everyone say: a military genius? Is a genius the person who manages to order the delivery of crackers in time and go to the right, to the left? Just because military people are clothed with brilliance and power, and masses of scoundrels flatter power, giving it the unusual qualities of a genius, they are called geniuses. On the contrary, the best generals I have known are stupid or distracted people. The best Bagration, - Napoleon himself admitted this. And Bonaparte himself! I remember his self-satisfied and limited face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good commander need no genius or any special qualities, but, on the contrary, he needs the absence of the best, highest, human qualities - love, poetry, tenderness, philosophical inquisitive doubt. He must be limited, firmly convinced that what he does is very important (otherwise he will lack patience), and then only he will be a brave commander. God forbid, if he is a man, he will love someone, take pity, think about what is fair and what is not. It is clear that from time immemorial the theory of geniuses has been forged for them, because they are the authorities. The merit in the success of military affairs does not depend on them, but on the person who shouts in the ranks: they are gone, or shouts: hurrah! And only in these ranks can you serve with confidence that you are useful!“","The debate went on for a long time, and the longer it went on, the more heated the argument became, reaching the point of shouting and personal remarks, and the less possible it was to draw any general conclusion from all that had been said. Listening to this multilingual talk, and these suggestions, plans, and refutations, and shouts, Prince Andrei was simply amazed at what they all said. The thoughts he often used to have long ago, during the time of his military activity, that there was not and could not be any military science, and therefore there could not be any so-called military genius, now acquired for him the perfect evidence of truth. “What theory and what science could there be in a matter of which the conditions and circumstances are unknown and cannot be determined, in which the strength of those active in war can still less be determined? No one could or can know what position our own and the enemy army will be in a day later, and no one can know the strength of this or that detachment. Sometimes, when there's no coward at the head who shouts 'We're cut off!' and runs away, but a cheerful, bold man who shouts 'Hurrah!'—a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Schöngraben, and sometimes fifty thousand flee in the face of eight, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in which, as in any practical matter, nothing can be determined and everything depends on countless circumstances, the significance of which is determined at a certain moment, and no one knows when that moment will come? Armfelt says our army is cut off, and Paulucci says we've put the French army between two fires; Michaud says the Drissa camp is no good because the river is behind it, and Pfuel says its strength lies in that. Toll suggests one plan, Armfelt another; they're all good, and they're all bad, and the advantages of any position can become evident only at the moment when the event occurs. And why do they all talk about military genius? Is that man a genius who manages to order a timely delivery of biscuits and tells this one to go right and that one to go left? It is only because military men are clothed in splendor and power, and masses of scoundrels flatter power, endowing it with qualities of genius it does not have, that they are called geniuses. On the contrary, the best generals I knew were stupid or absentminded people. Bagration was the best—Napoleon himself recognized that. And Bonaparte himself! I remember his self-satisfied and limited face on the battlefield at Austerlitz. A good commander not only does not need genius or any special qualities, but, on the contrary, he needs the absence of the best and highest human qualities—love, poetry, tenderness, a searching philosophical doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he would not have patience enough), and only then will he be a brave commander. God forbid he should be a human being and come to love or pity someone, or start thinking about what is just and what isn't. Understandably, the theory of genius was cut to fit them of old, because they are—power. The merit of success in military affairs does not depend on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts 'We're lost!' or shouts 'Hurrah!' And it is only in the ranks that one can serve with the assurance of being useful!”","The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrei, listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities—the idea that there is not, and cannot be, any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius—now appeared to him an obvious truth. ‘What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy’s armies will be in a day’s time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment. Sometimes—when there is not a coward at the front to shout, “We are cut off” and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts “Hurrah!”—a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Schön Graben, while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined, and everything depends on innumerable conditions the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestion can only be seen at the moment of trial. And why do they all speak of a “military genius”? Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power, and crowds of sycophants flatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their “genius” was invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts “We are lost!” or who shouts “Hurrah!” And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful.’"

He sat down at the dusty writing-table, and having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation."

"Сумерки спустились на землю, и гул орудий затих. Пьер, облокотившись на руку, лег и лежал так долго, глядя на продвигавшиеся мимо него в темноте тени. Беспрестанно ему казалось, что с страшным свистом налетало на него ядро; он вздрагивал и приподнимался. Он не помнил, сколько времени он пробыл тут. В середине ночи трое солдат, притащив сучьев, поместились подле него и стали разводить огонь.","Twilight descended on the earth, and the rumble of the guns subsided. Pierre, leaning on his arm, lay down and lay for such a long time, looking at the shadows moving past him in the darkness.

In the middle of the night, three soldiers, dragging branches, placed themselves beside him and began to make fire.","Dusk had fallen over the earth, and the roar of the artillery had died down. Pierre, propping himself on his elbow, lay down and stayed that way for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness.

"«Сами себя богу предадим, — повторила в своей душе Наташа. — Боже мой, предаю себя твоей воле, — думала она. — Ничего не хочу, не желаю; научи меня, что мне делать, куда употребить свою волю! Да возьми же меня, возьми меня! — с умиленным нетерпением в душе говорила Наташа, не крестясь, опустив свои тонкие руки и как будто ожидая, что вот-вот невидимая сила возьмет ее и избавит от себя, от своих сожалений, желаний, укоров, надежд и пороков.","“We will betray ourselves to God,” Natasha repeated in her soul.

"К сумеркам канонада стала стихать. Алпатыч вышел из подвала и остановился в дверях. Прежде ясное вечера нее небо все было застлано дымом. И сквозь этот дым странно светил молодой, высоко стоящий серп месяца. После замолкшего прежнего страшного гула орудий над городом казалась тишина, прерываемая только как бы распространенным по всему городу шелестом шагов, стонов, дальних криков и треска пожаров. Стоны кухарки теперь затихли. С двух сторон поднимались и расходились черные клубы дыма от пожаров. На улице не рядами, а как муравьи из разоренной кочки, в разных мундирах и в разных направлениях, проходили и пробегали солдаты. В глазах Алпатыча несколько из них забежали на двор Ферапонтова. Алпатыч вышел к воротам. Какой-то полк, теснясь и спеша, запрудил улицу, идя назад.","By dusk, the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych came out of the basement and stopped at the door.

The groans of the cook are now quiet. From both sides, black clouds of smoke from fires rose and dispersed. On the street, not in rows, but like ants from a ruined tussock, in different uniforms and in different directions, soldiers passed and ran through.

"С того дня, как Пьер, уезжая от Ростовых и вспоминая благодарный взгляд Наташи, смотрел на комету, стоявшую на небе, и почувствовал, что для него открылось что-то новое, — вечно мучивший его вопрос о тщете и безумности всего земного перестал представляться ему. Этот страшный вопрос: зачем? к чему? — который прежде представлялся ему в середине всякого занятия, теперь заменился для него не другим вопросом и не ответом на прежний вопрос, а представлением ее. Слышал ли он, и сам ли вел ничтожные разговоры, читал ли он, или узнавал про подлость и бессмысленность людскую, он не ужасался, как прежде; не спрашивал себя, из чего хлопочут люди, когда все так кратко и неизвестно, но вспоминал ее в том виде, в котором он видел ее в последний раз, и все сомнения его исчезали, не потому, что она отвечала на вопросы, которые представлялись ему, но потому, что представление о ней переносило его мгновенно в другую, светлую область душевной деятельности, в которой не могло быть правого или виноватого, в область красоты и любви, для которой стоило жить. Какая бы мерзость житейская ни представлялась ему, он говорил себе:","From the day Pierre, leaving the Rostovs and remembering Natasha’s grateful look, looked at the comet standing in the sky and felt that something new had opened up for him, the question of the futility and madness of everything earthly that had always tormented him ceased to present itself to him. . This terrible question: why? for what? - which had previously presented itself to him in the middle of every lesson, was now replaced for him not by another question and not by an answer to the former question, but by presenting it. Whether he heard, and whether he himself carried on insignificant conversations, whether he read, or found out about the meanness and senselessness of human beings, he was not horrified, as before; he did not ask himself why people were busy when everything was so brief and unknown, but he remembered her in the form in which he saw her for the last time, and all his doubts disappeared, not because she answered the questions that presented themselves to him , but because the idea of her instantly transferred him to another, bright area of mental activity, in which there could be no right or wrong, to the area of beauty and love, for which it was worth living. Whatever the abomination of life seemed to him, he said to himself:","Since the day when Pierre, leaving the Rostovs' and remembering Natasha's grateful eyes, had looked at the comet that hung in the sky, and had felt that something new had been revealed to him— the question that eternally tormented him about the vanity and folly of all earthly things had stopped presenting itself to him. That terrible question—”Why? What for?”—which used to present itself to him amidst every occupation, was now replaced for him not by another question and not by the answer to the old question, but by her image. Listening to a trivial conversation, or engaged in one himself, or reading, or learning about the baseness and senselessness of people, he was not horrified as he used to be; he did not ask himself why people made a fuss, if everything was so brief and unknown, but he remembered her the way he had seen her the last time, and all his doubts vanished, not because she answered the questions that presented themselves to him, but because her image immediately transferred him to a different, bright realm of inner activity, in which no one could be right or wrong, into a realm of beauty and love for which it was worth living. Whatever vileness of life presented itself to him, he said to himself:","FROM the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs’ with Natasha’s grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon—from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question ‘Why?’ ‘Wherefore?’ which had come to him amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things, when all is so transient and incomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts vanished—not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty—a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him he said to himself, ‘Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the country and the Tsar confer honours upon him, what does that matter?"

"— Как я рада, что вы приехали! Я нынче так счастлива! — сказала она с тем прежним оживлением, которого уже давно не видел в ней Пьер. — Вы знаете, Nicolas получил Георгиевский крест.

I'm so proud of him.","“How glad I am you've come! I'm so happy today!” she said with the old animation, which Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. “You know, Nicolas was awarded the St. George Cross.

"— Отчего вы не говорите? — обратилась княжна к старому старику, который, облокотившись на палку, стоял перед ней. — Скажи, ежели ты думаешь, что еще что-нибудь нужно.

Но он, как бы рассердившись за это, опустил совсем голову и проговорил:","Why don't you speak? - the princess turned to the old old man, who, leaning on a stick, was standing in front of her.

"С каждым новым ударом все меньше и меньше случайностей жизни оставалось для тех, которые еще не были убиты. Полк стоял в батальонных колоннах на расстоянии трехсот шагов, но, несмотря на то, все люди полка находились под влиянием одного и того же настроения. Все люди полка одинаково были молчаливы и мрачны. Редко слышался между рядами говор, но говор этот замолкал всякий раз, как слышался попавший удар и крик: «Носилки!» Большую часть времени люди полка по приказанию начальства сидели на земле. Кто, сняв кивер, старательно распускал и опять собирал сборки; кто сухой глиной, распорошив ее в ладонях, начищал штык; кто разминал ремень и перетягивал пряжку перевязи; кто старательно расправлял и перегибал по-новому подвертки и переобувался. Некоторые строили домики из калмыжек пашни или плели плетеночки из соломы жнивья. Все казались вполне погружены в эти занятия. Когда ранило и убивало людей, когда тянулись носилки, когда наши возвращались назад, когда виднелись сквозь дым большие массы неприятелей, никто не обращал никакого внимания на эти обстоятельства. Когда же вперед проезжала артиллерия, кавалерия, виднелись движения нашей пехоты, одобрительные замечания слышались со всех сторон. Но самое большое внимание заслуживали события совершенно посторонние, не имевшие никакого отношения к сражению. Как будто внимание этих нравственно измученных людей отдыхало на этих обычных, житейских событиях. Батарея артиллерии прошла пред фронтом полка. В одном из артиллерийских ящиков пристяжная заступила постромку. «Эй, пристяжную-то!.. Выправь! Упадет… Эх, не видят!.. — по всему полку одинаково кричали из рядов. В другой раз общее внимание обратила небольшая коричневая собачонка с твердо поднятым хвостом, которая, бог знает откуда взявшись, озабоченной рысцой выбежала перед ряды и вдруг от близко ударившего ядра взвизгнула и, поджав хвост, бросилась в сторону. По всему полку раздалось гоготанье и взвизги. Но развлечения такого рода продолжались минуты, а люди уже более восьми часов стояли без еды и без дела под непроходящим ужасом смерти, и бледные и нахмуренные лица все более бледнели и хмурились.","With each new blow, fewer and fewer accidents of life remained for those who had not yet been killed. The regiment stood in battalion columns at a distance of three hundred paces, but, despite the fact, all the people of the regiment were under the influence of the same mood. All the people of the regiment were equally silent and gloomy. Rarely was a conversation heard between the rows, but this conversation fell silent every time a blow was heard and a cry: ""Stretcher!"" Most of the time, the people of the regiment, by order of the authorities, sat on the ground. Who, having removed the shako, diligently disbanded and again gathered the assemblies; some with dry clay, spreading it in their palms, polished the bayonet; who kneaded the belt and tightened the buckle of the sling; who diligently straightened and bent the heels in a new way and changed their shoes. Some built houses from Kalmyk arable land or wove braids from stubble straw. Everyone seemed quite immersed in these activities. When people were wounded and killed, when stretchers were dragged, when our people were returning back, when large masses of enemies were visible through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these circumstances. When artillery and cavalry rode forward, the movements of our infantry were visible, approving remarks were heard from all sides. But the events that were completely extraneous, which had nothing to do with the battle, deserved the greatest attention. As if the attention of these morally tormented people rested on these ordinary, everyday events. The artillery battery passed in front of the front of the regiment. In one of the artillery boxes, the tie-down line intervened. “Hey, tie-down something! .. Straighten it! It will fall ... Oh, they don’t see it! .. - they shouted from the ranks in the same way throughout the regiment. Another time, a small brown dog with a firmly raised tail drew general attention, which, God knows where it came from, ran in an anxious trot in front of the ranks and suddenly squealed from a close-hitting shot and, tail between its legs, rushed to the side. There were chuckles and squeals all over the regiment. But entertainment of this kind lasted for minutes, and for more than eight hours people had been standing without food and doing nothing under the unceasing horror of death, and pale and frowning faces grew paler and more frowning.","With each new blow, the chances of survival for those who had not yet been killed grew less and less. The regiment stood by battalions in columns three hundred paces apart, but, despite that, the men of the regiment were all under the sway of the same mood. The men of the regiment were all equally silent and gloomy. Talk was heard rarely among the ranks, but that talk would fall silent each time they heard a shot strike home and the cry “Stretcher!” Most of the time the men of the regiment, on orders from their superiors, sat on the ground. One, taking off his shako, carefully undid and redid the gathers; another, crumbling some dry clay between his palms, polished his bayonet; a third worked the leather and readjusted the buckle of his bandolier; yet another carefully spread out his footcloth, wound it up again, and put his boot back on. Some built little houses from the clods of the field or plaited little baskets out of straw. They all seemed fully immersed in these occupations. When men were wounded or killed, when stretchers were carried past, when our troops retreated, when large masses of the enemy were seen through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these circumstances. But when the artillery or cavalry advanced, or movements of our infantry could be seen, approving remarks could be heard on all sides. But the greatest attention was accorded to totally extraneous events, which had no relation to the battle. It was as if the attention of these morally exhausted men found rest in these ordinary everyday events. An artillery battery was passing by in front of the regiment. The outrunner of one of the artillery caissons stepped over a trace. “Hey, that outrunner! ... Put it right! It'll fall... Eh, they don't see it! ...” men shouted from the ranks all through the regiment. Another time, general attention was drawn to a little brown dog with a stiffly raised tail, who, coming from God knows where, trotted out in front of the ranks with a preoccupied air and, when a cannonball suddenly hit close by, squealed and dashed off, its tail between its legs. Guffaws and squeals came from all over the regiment. But distractions of this sort last only a few minutes, while the men had been standing for more than eight hours with no food and with nothing to do, under the relentless terror of death, and their pale and frowning faces grew more pale and frowning.","With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of ‘stretchers!’ was heard. Most of the time, by their officers’ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg-bands and put his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the ploughed ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday, commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace. ‘Hey, look at the trace horse! … Get her leg out! She’ll fall … Ah, they don’t see it!’ came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment. Another time general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier."
"С приближением неприятеля к Москве взгляд москвичей на свое положение не только не делался серьезнее, но, напротив, еще легкомысленнее, как это всегда бывает с людьми, которые видят приближающуюся большую опасность. При приближении опасности всегда два голоса одинаково сильно говорят в душе человека: один весьма разумно говорит о том, чтобы человек обдумал самое свойство опасности и средства для избавления от нее; другой еще разумнее говорит, что слишком тяжело и мучительно думать об опасности, тогда как предвидеть все и спастись от общего хода дела не во власти человека, и потому лучше отвернуться от тяжелого, до тех пор пока оно не наступило, и думать о приятном. В одиночестве человек большею частью отдается первому голосу, в обществе, напротив, — второму. Так было и теперь с жителями Москвы. Давно так не веселились в Москве, как этот год.","As the enemy approached Moscow, the Muscovites' view of their situation not only did not become more serious, but, on the contrary, even more frivolous, as is always the case with people who see a great danger approaching. When danger approaches, two voices always speak equally strongly in a person’s soul: one very reasonably says that a person should consider the very nature of the danger and the means to get rid of it; the other says even more sensibly that it is too hard and painful to think about danger, while it is not in the power of man to foresee everything and save himself from the general course of affairs, and therefore it is better to turn away from the difficult until it comes, and think about the pleasant. In solitude, a person for the most part gives himself to the first voice, in society, on the contrary, to the second. So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. For a long time they did not have so much fun in Moscow as this year.","With the enemy's approach to Moscow, the Muscovites' view of their situation not only did not become more serious, but, on the contrary, became still more light-minded, as always happens with people who see great danger approaching. At the approach of danger, two voices always speak with equal force in a man's soul: one quite reasonably tells the man to consider the properties of the danger and the means of saving himself from it; the other says still more reasonably that it is too painful and tormenting to think about the danger, when it is not in man's power to foresee everything and save himself from the general course of things, and therefore it is better to turn away from the painful things until they come and think about what is pleasant. In solitude, a man most often yields to the first voice; in company, on the contrary, to the second. That is what now happened with the citizens of Moscow. It was long since there had been so much merrymaking in Moscow as there was that year.","With the enemy’s approach to Moscow the Moscovites’ view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching.

In solitude a man generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in Moscow as that year."

Но оправиться и перейти в другое место не было никакой возможности от тесноты. Один из проезжавших генералов был знакомый Ростовых. Петя хотел просить его помощи, но счел, что это было бы противно мужеству. Когда все экипажи проехали, толпа хлынула и вынесла и Петю на площадь, которая была вся занята народом. Не только по площади, но на откосах, на крышах, везде был народ. Только что Петя очутился на площади, он явственно услыхал наполнявшие весь Кремль звуки колоколов и радостного народного говора.","Petya felt that he had an unpresentable appearance, and was afraid that if he presented himself to the chamberlains like that, he would not be allowed to see the sovereign. But there was no way to recover and go to another place because of the tightness.

When all the carriages had passed, the crowd poured in and carried Petya out to the square, which was all occupied by people. Not only in the area, but on the slopes, on the roofs, there were people everywhere. As soon as Petya found himself on the square, he distinctly heard the sounds of bells filling the entire Kremlin and the joyful folk talk.","Petya felt that he looked unpresentable and was afraid that, if he appeared before the gentlemen-in-waiting like that, he would not be admitted to the sovereign.

"Наташа была спокойнее, но не веселее. Она не только избегала всех внешних условий радости: балов, катанья, концертов, театра; но она ни разу не смеялась так, чтобы из-за смеха ее не слышны были слезы. Она не могла петь. Как только начинала она смеяться или пробовала одна сама с собой петь, слезы душили ее: слезы раскаяния, слезы воспоминаний о том невозвратном, чистом времени; слезы досады, что так, задаром, погубила она свою молодую жизнь, которая могла бы быть так счастлива. Смех и пение особенно казались ей кощунством над ее горем. О кокетстве она и не думала ни раза; ей не приходилось даже воздерживаться. Она говорила и чувствовала, что в это время все мужчины были для нее совершенно то же, что шут Настасья Ивановна. Внутренний страж твердо воспрещал ей всякую радость. Да и не было в ней всех прежних интересов жизни из того девичьего, беззаботного, полного надежд склада жизни. Чаще и болезненнее всего вспоминала она осенние месяцы, охоту, дядюшку и святки, проведенные с Nicolas в Отрадном. Что бы она дала, чтобы возвратить хоть один день из того времени! Но уж это навсегда было кончено. Предчувствие не обманывало ее тогда, что то состояние свободы и открытости для всех радостей никогда уже не возвратится больше.

Laughter and singing especially seemed to her a blasphemy against her grief. She never thought of coquetry; she didn't even have to refrain. She said and felt that at that time all men were to her exactly the same as the jester Nastasya Ivanovna. The inner guard firmly forbade her any joy. And she did not have all the former interests of life from that girlish, carefree, hopeful way of life. Most often and most painfully, she recalled the autumn months, the hunt, her uncle, and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicolas in Otradnoe. What would she give to bring back even one day from that time! But it was over forever. The foreboding did not deceive her then that that state of freedom and openness to all joys would never return again. But I had to live.","Natasha was more calm, but not more cheerful.

Her presentiment had not deceived her then, that that state of freedom and openness to all joys would never return again. Yet one had to live.","NATASHA was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure—balls, promenades, concerts, and theatres—but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint no wish to flirt ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, Uncle, and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicolas at Otradnoe, were what she recalled most often and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time! But it was gone for ever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her—that that state of freedom and openness to all joy would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live on."
"— Я? я?.. — сказал Пьер, чувствуя необходимость умалить как возможно свое общественное положение, чтобы быть ближе и понятнее для солдат. — Я по-настоящему ополченный офицер, только моей дружины тут нет; я приезжал на сраженье и потерял своих.","- I AM? me? .. - said Pierre, feeling the need to belittle his social position as much as possible in order to be closer and more understandable to the soldiers. “I am a truly militia officer, only my squad is not here; I came to the battle and lost mine.","“I? I? ...” said Pierre, feeling it necessary to diminish his social position as much as possible, so as to be closer and more understandable to the soldiers. “I'm actually a militia officer, only my detachment isn't here; I was in the battle and lost my men.”","‘I, I …’ said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them. ‘ By rights I am a militia officer, but my men are not here.

"— Вот я говорил, что еще подождать — так и вышло, — с разных сторон радостно говорили в народе.","“So I said that we still have to wait - and it happened,” the people said joyfully from different sides.","“See, I said to keep waiting—and I was right,” people said joyfully from various sides.",‘There! I said if only we waited—and so it was!’ was being joyfully said by various people.

"Итак, Бородинское сражение произошло совсем не так, как (стараясь скрыть ошибки наших военачальников и вследствие того умаляя славу русского войска и народа) описывают его. Бородинское сражение не произошло на избранной и укрепленной позиции с несколько только слабейшими со стороны русских силами, а Бородинское сражение, вследствие потери Шевардинского редута, принято было русскими на открытой, почти не укрепленной местности с вдвое слабейшими силами против французов, то есть в таких условиях, в которых не только немыслимо было драться десять часов и сделать сражение нерешительным, но немыслимо было удержать в продолжение трех часов армию от совершенного разгрома и бегства.","So, the battle of Borodino did not happen at all as (trying to hide the mistakes of our military leaders and, as a result, belittling the glory of the Russian army and people) describe it. The battle of Borodino did not take place on a chosen and fortified position with only the weakest forces on the part of the Russians, and the battle of Borodino, due to the loss of the Shevardinsky redoubt, was taken by the Russians in an open, almost unfortified area with twice the weakest forces against the French, that is, under such conditions, in which it was not only unthinkable to fight for ten hours and make the battle indecisive, but it was unthinkable to keep the army from complete defeat and flight for three hours.","And so, the battle of Borodino took place not at all as it is described (in an attempt to conceal the mistakes of our commanders and thereby diminishing the glory of the Russian army and people). The battle of Borodino did not take place on a chosen and fortified position, with only slightly weaker forces on the Russian side, but, owing to the loss of the Shevardino redoubt, was accepted by the Russians on open, almost unfortified terrain with forces twice weaker than the French—that is, in conditions in which it was not only unthinkable to fight for ten hours and leave the battle undecided, but unthinkable to keep the army for as long as three hours from total destruction and flight.","So the battle of Borodino did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders’ mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to keep an army even for three hours from complete disintegration and flight."
"С этого дня, во время всего дальнейшего путешествия Ростовых, на всех отдыхах и ночлегах, Наташа не отходила от раненого Болконского, и доктор должен был признаться, что он не ожидал от девицы ни такой твердости, ни такого искусства ходить за раненым.","From that day on, during the entire further journey of the Rostovs, at all rests and overnight stays, Natasha did not leave the wounded Bolkonsky, and the doctor had to admit that he did not expect such firmness from the girl, nor such art to follow the wounded.","From that day on, through all the rest of the Rostovs' journey, at every stopping or sleeping place, Natasha never left the wounded Bolkonsky, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young lady either such firmness or such skill in looking after a wounded man.","From that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs’ journey, at every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha never left the wounded Bolkonsky, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness, or such skill in nursing a wounded man."
"Как ни страшна казалась для графини мысль, что князь Андрей мог (весьма вероятно, по словам доктора) умереть во время дороги на руках ее дочери, она не могла противиться Наташе. Хотя вследствие теперь установившегося сближения между раненым князем Андреем и Наташей приходило в голову, что в случае выздоровления прежние отношения жениха и невесты будут возобновлены, никто, еще менее Наташа и князь Андрей, не говорил об этом: нерешенный, висящий вопрос жизни или смерти не только над Болконским, но над Россией заслонял все другие предположения.","No matter how terrible the idea seemed to the countess that Prince Andrei could (very likely, according to the doctor) die during the journey in the arms of her daughter, she could not resist Natasha. Although, as a result of the now established rapprochement between the wounded Prince Andrei and Natasha, it occurred to me that in the event of recovery, the former relations between the bride and groom would be resumed, no one, still less Natasha and Prince Andrei, spoke about this: the unresolved, hanging question of life or death was not only over Bolkonsky, but over Russia obscured all other assumptions.","Terrible as the thought seemed to the countess that Prince Andrei might (and, according to the doctor, quite probably would) die in her daughter's arms during the journey, she was unable to oppose Natasha. Though it was conceivable that, owing to the closeness now established between the wounded Prince Andrei and Natasha, their former engagement might be renewed in case he recovered, no one spoke of it, least of all Natasha and Prince Andrei; the unresolved question of life and death hanging not only over Bolkonsky but over Russia shut out all other conjectures.","Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrei die in her daughter’s arms during the journey—as, judging by what the doctor said, seemed might easily happen—she could not oppose Natasha. Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natasha, the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed, no one—least of all Natasha and Prince Andrei—spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over Bolkonsky but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations."
"Хотя и не совсем ясно было, что именно хотел выразить живописец, представив так называемого короля Рима протыкающим земной шар палочкой, но аллегория эта, так же как и всем видевшим картину в Париже, так и Наполеону, очевидно, показалась ясною и весьма понравилась.","Although it was not entirely clear what exactly the painter wanted to express, imagining the so-called King of Rome piercing the globe with a stick, but this allegory, like everyone who saw the picture in Paris, and Napoleon, obviously, seemed clear and very pleased.","It was not entirely clear precisely what the painter meant to express by presenting the so-called king of Rome skewering the terrestrial globe with a stick, but the allegory, to all those who had seen the picture in Paris, and to Napoleon himself, obviously seemed clear and quite pleasing.","Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing."
"— Ah, ah, ah!.. — Француз весело, сангвинически расхохотался, трепля по плечу Пьера. — Ah! elle est forte celle-la, — проговорил он. — Paris? Mais Paris-Paris… [Ха, ха, ха!.. А вот сказал штуку. Париж?.. Но Париж… Париж…]","- Ah, ah, ah! .. - The Frenchman laughed merrily, sanguinely, patting Pierre on the shoulder. — Ah! elle est forte celle-la,” he said. — Paris?

"Одно, чего желал теперь Пьер всеми силами своей души, было то, чтобы выйти поскорее из тех страшных впечатлений, в которых он жил этот день, вернуться к обычным условиям жизни и заснуть спокойно в комнате на своей постели. Только в обычных условиях жизни он чувствовал, что будет в состоянии понять самого себя и все то, что он видел и испытал. Но этих обычных условий жизни нигде не было.","One thing that Pierre now wanted with all the strength of his soul was to get out of those terrible impressions in which he lived that day as soon as possible, return to the usual conditions of life and fall asleep peacefully in the room on his bed.

"— Пойдем, пойдем ко мне, поговорим, — сказал он; но в это время Денисов, так же мало робевший перед начальством, как и перед неприятелем, несмотря на то, что адъютанты у крыльца сердитым шепотом останавливали его, смело, стуча шпорами по ступенькам, вошел на крыльцо. Кутузов, оставив руки упертыми на лавку, недовольно смотрел на Денисова. Денисов, назвав себя, объявил, что имеет сообщить его светлости дело большой важности для блага отечества. Кутузов усталым взглядом стал смотреть на Денисова и досадливым жестом, приняв руки и сложив их на животе, повторил: «Для блага отечества? Ну что такое? Говори». Денисов покраснел, как девушка (так странно было видеть краску на этом усатом, старом и пьяном лице), и смело начал излагать свой план разрезания операционной линии неприятеля между Смоленском и Вязьмой. Денисов жил в этих краях и знал хорошо местность. План его казался несомненно хорошим, в особенности по той силе убеждения, которая была в его словах. Кутузов смотрел себе на ноги и изредка оглядывался на двор соседней избы, как будто он ждал чего-то неприятного оттуда. Из избы, на которую он смотрел, действительно во время речи Денисова показался генерал с портфелем под мышкой.","""Come, come to me, we'll talk,"" he said; but at this time Denisov, as little shy before his superiors as before the enemy, despite the fact that the adjutants at the porch stopped him in an angry whisper, boldly, banging his spurs on the steps, entered the porch. Kutuzov, leaving his hands resting on the bench, looked displeasedly at Denisov. Denisov, having named himself, announced that he had to inform his lordship of a matter of great importance for the good of the fatherland. Kutuzov began to look at Denisov with a tired look and with an annoyed gesture, taking his hands and folding them on his stomach, he repeated: “For the good of the fatherland? Well, what is it? Speak."" Denisov blushed like a girl (it was so strange to see the color on that mustachioed, old and drunken face), and boldly began to outline his plan for cutting the enemy's line of operations between Smolensk and Vyazma. Denisov lived in these parts and knew the area well. His plan seemed undoubtedly good, especially in terms of the force of conviction that was in his words. Kutuzov looked at his feet and occasionally looked back at the courtyard of a neighboring hut, as if he was expecting something unpleasant from there. Indeed, during Denisov's speech, a general appeared from the hut he was looking at with a briefcase under his arm.","“Come along, come to my place, we'll have a talk,” he said; but just then Denisov, who quailed as little before his superiors as he did before the enemy, though the adjutants by the porch tried to stop him with angry whispers, boldly went up the steps, his spurs knocking against them. Kutuzov, leaving his hands propped on the bench, looked at Denisov with displeasure. Denisov gave his name and announced that he had to inform his serenity of a matter of great importance for the good of the fatherland. Kutuzov began to look at Denisov with his weary gaze and, in a gesture of vexation, taking his hands from the bench and folding them over his stomach, repeated: “For the good of the fatherland? Well, what is it? Speak.” Denisov blushed like a girl (how strange it was to see a blush on that mustached, old, and drunken face), and boldly began to set forth his plan for cutting the enemy's line of operations between Smolensk and the Vyazma. Denisov used to live in that area and knew the terrain well. His plan seemed unquestionably good, especially from the power of conviction in his words. Kutuzov was looking at his feet and occasionally glanced at the courtyard of the neighboring cottage, as if expecting something unpleasant from there. And in fact, during the time that Denisov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm appeared from the cottage he was looking at.","‘Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk,’ said he. But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutuzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denisov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their country’s welfare. Kutuzov looked wearily at him, and lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words: ‘ For our country’s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!’ Denisov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the colour rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy’s lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma. * Denisov came from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from that hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear."
"— Батюшка, я не хотел быть судьей, — сказал князь Андрей желчным и жестким тоном, — но вы вызвали меня, и я сказал и всегда скажу, что княжна Марья ни виновата, а виноваты… виновата эта француженка…","“Father, I didn’t want to be a judge,” said Prince Andrei in a bilious and harsh tone, “but you called me, and I said and I will always say that Princess Mary is not to blame, but to blame ... this Frenchwoman is to blame ...","“Papa, I didn't want to judge,” Prince Andrei said in a bilious and hard tone, “but you challenged me, and I've said and will always say that Princess Marya is not to blame, but the one to blame... the one to blame is this Frenchwoman...”","‘Father, I did not want to judge,’ said Prince Andrei in a hard and bitter tone, ‘but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall say, that Marya is not to blame, but those to blame—the one to blame—is that Frenchwoman.’"

What heroism, Count!","Just then Boris, with his courtly adroitness, moved up next to Pierre, in proximity to his superior, and with the most natural air, and not loudly, as if continuing a conversation they had already begun, said to Pierre: “The militiamen—they just went and put on clean white shirts, so as to be prepared for death.

"Ей отрадно было думать, что она не лучше, как она прежде думала, а хуже и гораздо хуже всех, всех, кто только есть на свете. Но этого мало было. Она знала это и спрашивала себя: «Что ж дальше? А дальше ничего не было. Не было никакой радости в жизни, а жизнь проходила. Наташа, видимо, старалась только никому не быть в тягость и никому не мешать, но для себя ей ничего не нужно было. Она удалялась от всех домашних, и только с братом Петей ей было легко. С ним она любила бывать больше, чем с другими; и иногда, когда была с ним с глазу на глаз, смеялась. Она почти не выезжала из дому и из приезжавших к ним рада была только одному Пьеру. Нельзя было нежнее, осторожнее и вместе с тем серьезнее обращаться, чем обращался с нею граф Безухов. Наташа бессознательно чувствовала эту нежность обращения и потому находила большое удовольствие в его обществе. Но она даже не была благодарна ему за его нежность; ничто хорошее со стороны Пьера не казалось ей усилием. Пьеру, казалось, так естественно быть добрым со всеми, что не было никакой заслуги в его доброте. Иногда Наташа замечала смущение и неловкость Пьера в ее присутствии, в особенности, когда он хотел сделать для нее что-нибудь приятное или когда он боялся, чтобы что-нибудь в разговоре не навело Наташу на тяжелые воспоминания. Она замечала это и приписывала это его общей доброте и застенчивости, которая, по ее понятиям, таковая же, как с нею, должна была быть и со всеми. После тех нечаянных слов о том, что, ежели бы он был свободен, он на коленях бы просил ее руки и любви, сказанных в минуту такого сильного волнения для нее, Пьер никогда не говорил ничего о своих чувствах к Наташе; и для нее было очевидно, что те слова, тогда так утешившие ее, были сказаны, как говорятся всякие бессмысленные слова для утешения плачущего ребенка. Не оттого, что Пьер был женатый человек, но оттого, что Наташа чувствовала между собою и им в высшей степени ту силу нравственных преград — отсутствие которой она чувствовала с Kyрагиным, — ей никогда в голову не приходило, чтобы из ее отношений с Пьером могла выйти не только любовь с ее или, еще менее, с его стороны, но даже и тот род нежной, признающей себя, поэтической дружбы между мужчиной и женщиной, которой она знала несколько примеров.","It was comforting to her to think that she was not better, as she had previously thought, but worse and much worse than everyone, everyone who only exists in the world. But this was not enough. She knew this and asked herself: “What next? And then there was nothing. There was no joy in life, and life passed. Natasha, apparently, tried only not to be a burden to anyone and not to interfere with anyone, but for herself she did not need anything. She moved away from everyone at home, and only with her brother Petya was it easy for her. She liked to be with him more than with the others; and sometimes, when she was with him eye to eye, she laughed. She hardly left the house, and of those who came to see them, she was glad only for Pierre. It was impossible to treat her more tenderly, more carefully, and at the same time more seriously than Count Bezukhov treated her. Natasha unconsciously felt this tenderness of treatment and therefore found great pleasure in his company. But she was not even grateful to him for his tenderness; nothing good on the part of Pierre seemed to her an effort. It seemed so natural for Pierre to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed Pierre's embarrassment and awkwardness in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something nice for her or when he was afraid that something in the conversation would bring Natasha to painful memories. She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness, which, according to her, the same as with her, should have been with everyone. After those inadvertent words that, if he were free, he would ask her hands and love on his knees, said at a moment of such great excitement for her, Pierre never said anything about his feelings for Natasha; and it was obvious to her that those words, which then so comforted her, were spoken, as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child. Not because Pierre was a married man, but because Natasha felt between herself and him in the highest degree that force of moral barriers - the absence of which she felt with Kyragin - it never occurred to her that she could get out of her relationship with Pierre not only love on her part, or still less on his part, but even that kind of tender, self-confessing, poetic friendship between a man and a woman, of which she knew several examples.","It comforted her to think that she was not better, as she had thought before, but worse, much worse, than everyone, everyone in the world. But that was not all. She knew it, and asked herself: “ And what then?” And then there was nothing. There was no joy in life, and life was going by. Natasha clearly tried only not to be a burden to anyone or to bother anyone, but for herself she wanted nothing. She avoided everyone in the house, and only felt at ease with her brother Petya. She liked being with him more than with the others; and sometimes, when they were alone together, she laughed. She hardly ever left the house, and of those who came to see them, she was glad only of Pierre.

Occasionally Natasha noticed Pierre's embarrassment and awkwardness in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or when he was afraid that something in their conversation might lead Natasha to painful memories. She noticed it and ascribed it to his general kindness and timidity, which, to her mind, must be the same with her as with everyone else. After those inadvertent words, that if he were free he would go on his knees and ask for her hand and her love, spoken at a moment of such intense emotion for her, Pierre had never said anything about his feelings for her; and it was obvious to her that the words which had comforted her so much then had been spoken the way all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a weeping child. Not because Pierre was a married man, but because Natasha felt in the highest degree the strength of the moral barriers between them—the absence of which she had felt with Kuragin—it never entered her head that her relations with Pierre might lead not only to love on her side, still less on his, but even to that sort of tender, self-aware, poetic friendship between a man and a woman, of which she knew several examples.","It comforted her to reflect that she was not better, as she had formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, ‘What next?’ But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was passing.

She hardly ever left the house, and of those who came to see them was only glad to see one person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously, than did Count Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy, and so found great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful to him for it, nothing good on Pierre’s part seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her.

After those involuntary words—that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love—uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha of his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because Natasha very strongly felt with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kuragin, that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances."

"«Le cosaque ignorant la compagnie dans laquelle il se trouvait, car la simplicite de Napoleon n'avait rien qui put reveler a une imagination orientale la presence d'un souverain, s'entretint avec la plus extreme familiarite des affaires de la guerre actuelle», [Казак, не зная того общества, в котором он находился, потому что простота Наполеона не имела ничего такого, что бы могло открыть для восточного воображения присутствие государя, разговаривал с чрезвычайной фамильярностью об обстоятельствах настоящей войны. ] — говорит Тьер, рассказывая этот эпизод. Действительно, Лаврушка, напившийся пьяным и оставивший барина без обеда, был высечен накануне и отправлен в деревню за курами, где он увлекся мародерством и был взят в плен французами. Лаврушка был один из тех грубых, наглых лакеев, видавших всякие виды, которые считают долгом все делать с подлостью и хитростью, которые готовы сослужить всякую службу своему барину и которые хитро угадывают барские дурные мысли, в особенности тщеславие и мелочность.","""Le cosaque ignorant la compagnie dans laquelle il se trouvait, car la simplicite de Napoleon n'avait rien qui put reveler a une imagination orientale la presence d'un souverain, s'entretint avec la plus extreme familiarite des affaires de la guerre actuelle"" , [The Cossack, not knowing the society in which he was, because the simplicity of Napoleon had nothing that could open the presence of the sovereign to the Eastern imagination, spoke with extreme familiarity about the circumstances of this war. ] - says Thiers, telling this episode. Indeed, Lavrushka, who got drunk and left the master without dinner, was whipped the day before and sent to the village for chickens, where he became interested in looting and was taken prisoner by the French. Lavrushka was one of those rude, insolent lackeys, who have seen all sorts of things, who consider it their duty to do everything with meanness and cunning, who are ready to render any service to their master, and who cunningly divine the master's evil thoughts, especially vanity and pettiness.","“Le cosaque ignorant la compagnie dans laquelle il se trouvait, car la simplicité de Napoléon n'avait rien qui put révéler, à une imagination orientale la présence d'un souverain, s'entretenait avec la plus extrême familiarité des affaires de la guerre actuelle,”[446] says Thiers, recounting this episode.[225] In fact, Lavrushka had received a whipping the day before for getting drunk and leaving his master without dinner, and had been sent to a village to get some chickens, and there, carried away by pillaging, had been taken prisoner by the French. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, insolent lackeys who had been around, who considered it their duty to do everything with meanness and cunning, who were ready to perform any service for their master, and who cunningly guess their master's bad thoughts, especially the vain and paltry ones.","‘Le cosaque ignorant la compagnie dans laquelle il se trouvait, car la simplicité de Napoléon n’avait rien que pût révéler à une imagination orientale la presence d’un souverain, s’entretient avec la plus extrême familiarité des affaires de la guerre actuelle,’3 says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality Lavrushka having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master’s baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness."
"Видно, Пфуль, уже всегда готовый на ироническое раздражение, нынче был особенно возбужден тем, что осмелились без него осматривать его лагерь и судить о нем. Князь Андрей по одному короткому этому свиданию с Пфулем благодаря своим аустерлицким воспоминаниям составил себе ясную характеристику этого человека. Пфуль был один из тех безнадежно, неизменно, до мученичества самоуверенных людей, которыми только бывают немцы, и именно потому, что только немцы бывают самоуверенными на основании отвлеченной идеи — науки, то есть мнимого знания совершенной истины. Француз бывает самоуверен потому, что он почитает себя лично, как умом, так и телом, непреодолимо-обворожительным как для мужчин, так и для женщин. Англичанин самоуверен на том основании, что он есть гражданин благоустроеннейшего в мире государства, и потому, как англичанин, знает всегда, что ему делать нужно, и знает, что все, что он делает как англичанин, несомненно хорошо. Итальянец самоуверен потому, что он взволнован и забывает легко и себя и других. Русский самоуверен именно потому, что он ничего не знает и знать не хочет, потому что не верит, чтобы можно было вполне знать что-нибудь. Немец самоуверен хуже всех, и тверже всех, и противнее всех, потому что он воображает, что знает истину, науку, которую он сам выдумал, но которая для него есть абсолютная истина. Таков, очевидно, был Пфуль. У него была наука — теория облического движения, выведенная им из истории войн Фридриха Великого, и все, что встречалось ему в новейшей истории войн Фридриха Великого, и все, что встречалось ему в новейшей военной истории, казалось ему бессмыслицей, варварством, безобразным столкновением, в котором с обеих сторон было сделано столько ошибок, что войны эти не могли быть названы войнами: они не подходили под теорию и не могли служить предметом науки.","Evidently, Pfuel, who was always ready for ironic irritation, was especially agitated today by the fact that they had dared to inspect his camp without him and judge him. Prince Andrei, from this one short meeting with Pfuel, thanks to his memories of Austerlitz, made up a clear characterization of this man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly, invariably, to the point of martyrdom, self-confident people that only Germans can be, and precisely because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract idea - science, that is, an imaginary knowledge of perfect truth. The Frenchman is self-confident because he considers himself personally, both in mind and in body, irresistibly charming for both men and women. An Englishman is self-confident on the grounds that he is a citizen of the most comfortable state in the world, and therefore, as an Englishman, he always knows what he needs to do, and knows that everything he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly good. The Italian is self-confident because he is agitated and easily forgets himself and others. The Russian is self-confident precisely because he knows nothing and does not want to know, because he does not believe that it is possible to fully know anything. The German is self-confident worse than anyone, and harder than everyone, and more disgusting than everyone, because he imagines that he knows the truth, a science that he himself invented, but which for him is absolute truth. Such, obviously, was Pfuel. He had a science - the theory of oblique movement, which he derived from the history of the wars of Frederick the Great, and everything that he encountered in the recent history of the wars of Frederick the Great, and everything that he encountered in the latest military history, seemed to him nonsense, barbarism, an ugly clash, in which so many mistakes were made on both sides that these wars could not be called wars: they did not fit the theory and could not serve as the subject of science.","Clearly, Pfuel, always ready for ironic irritation anyway, was especially upset that day that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp without him. From this one brief encounter with Pfuel, Prince Andrei, owing to his memories of Austerlitz, formed a clear notion of the man's character for himself. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly, permanently, painfully self-assured men as only Germans can be, and precisely because only Germans can be self-assured on the basis of an abstract idea—science, that is, an imaginary knowledge of the perfect truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he considers himself personally, in mind as well as body, irresistibly enchanting for men as well as women. An Englishman is self-assured on the grounds that he is a citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore, as an Englishman, he always knows what he must do, and knows that everything he does as an Englishman is unquestionably good. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and others. A Russian is self-assured precisely because he does not know anything and does not want to know anything, because he does not believe it possible to know anything fully. A German is self-assured worst of all, and most firmly of all, and most disgustingly of all, because he imagines that he knows the truth, science, which he has invented himself, but which for him is the absolute truth. Such, obviously, was Pfuel. He had science—the theory of the oblique movement, which he deduced from the history of the wars of Frederick the Great—and everything he came across in contemporary military history seemed to him senselessness, barbarism, grotesque clashes in which so many mistakes were made on both sides that these wars could not be called wars: they did not fit the theory and could not serve as material for science.","Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrei, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion—science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world and therefore, as an Englishman, always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German’s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth—science—which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth. Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science—the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great’s wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous—monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as material for science."

"И действительно, к вечеру подводы не были собраны. На деревне у кабака была опять сходка, и на сходке положено было угнать лошадей в лес и не выдавать подвод.

"Император Наполеон еще не выходил из своей спальни и оканчивал свой туалет. Он, пофыркивая и покряхтывая, поворачивался то толстой спиной, то обросшей жирной грудью под щетку, которою камердинер растирал его тело. Другой камердинер, придерживая пальцем склянку, брызгал одеколоном на выхоленное тело императора с таким выражением, которое говорило, что он один мог знать, сколько и куда надо брызнуть одеколону.

Marya Genrikhovna, seeing herself surrounded by such a brilliant and courteous youth, beamed with happiness, no matter how hard she tried to hide it and no matter how obviously shy at every sleepy movement of her husband sleeping behind her.","There were only three glasses; the water was so dirty that it was impossible to tell whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar only held water enough for six glasses, but the more pleasant it was to receive one's glass in turn and by seniority from the plump little hands of Marya Genrikhovna with their short, none-too-clean nails. All the officers, it seemed, were actually in love with Marya Genrikhovna that evening. Even the officers who were playing cards behind the partition soon stopped playing and went over to the samovar, yielding to the general atmosphere of courting Marya Genrikhovna. Marya Genrikhovna, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, shone with happiness, however she tried to hide it, and however timid she became at every movement her sleeping husband made behind her back.","There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive one’s tumbler from Marya Gendrikhovna’s plump little hands with their short and not over-clean nails. All the officers appeared to be and really were in love with her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Marya Gendrikhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her."

"Французы приписывали пожар Москвы au patriotisme feroce de Rastopchine [дикому патриотизму Растопчина]; русские — изуверству французов. В сущности же, причин пожара Москвы в том смысле, чтобы отнести пожар этот на ответственность одного или несколько лиц, таких причин не было и не могло быть. Москва сгорела вследствие того, что она была поставлена в такие условия, при которых всякий деревянный город должен сгореть, независимо от того, имеются ли или не имеются в городе сто тридцать плохих пожарных труб. Москва должна была сгореть вследствие того, что из нее выехали жители, и так же неизбежно, как должна загореться куча стружек, на которую в продолжение нескольких дней будут сыпаться искры огня. Деревянный город, в котором при жителях-владельцах домов и при полиции бывают летом почти каждый день пожары, не может не сгореть, когда в нем нет жителей, а живут войска, курящие трубки, раскладывающие костры на Сенатской площади из сенатских стульев и варящие себе есть два раза в день. Стоит в мирное время войскам расположиться на квартирах по деревням в известной местности, и количество пожаров в этой местности тотчас увеличивается. В какой же степени должна увеличиться вероятность пожаров в пустом деревянном городе, в котором расположится чужое войско? Le patriotisme feroce de Rastopchine и изуверство французов тут ни в чем не виноваты. Москва загорелась от трубок, от кухонь, от костров, от неряшливости неприятельских солдат, жителей — не хозяев домов. Ежели и были поджоги (что весьма сомнительно, потому что поджигать никому не было никакой причины, а, во всяком случае, хлопотливо и опасно), то поджоги нельзя принять за причину, так как без поджогов было бы то же самое.","The French attributed the fire of Moscow to au patriotisme feroce de Rastopchine [Rastopchin's wild patriotism]; the Russians to the savagery of the French. In essence, there were no such reasons and could not be. Moscow burned down due to the fact that it was placed in such conditions under which any wooden city must burn down, regardless of whether or not there are one hundred and thirty bad fire pipes in the city. Moscow had to burn down due to the fact that the inhabitants left it, and just as inevitably as a pile of shavings should catch fire, on which sparks of fire would fall for several days. A wooden city, in which there are fires almost every day in the summer with the residents who own houses and with the police, cannot help but burn when there are no inhabitants in it, but troops live, smoking pipes, laying fires on Senate Square from Senate chairs and cooking their own food. twice a day. In peacetime, it is necessary for troops to settle down in apartments in villages in a certain area, and the number of fires in this area immediately increases. To what extent should the probability of fires increase in an empty wooden city in which a foreign army is stationed? Le patriotisme feroce de Rastopchine and the savagery of the French are not to blame for anything here. Moscow caught fire from pipes, from kitchens, from bonfires, from the slovenliness of enemy soldiers, residents - not the owners of houses. If there were arson (which is very doubtful, because there was no reason for anyone to set fire, and, in any case, troublesome and dangerous), then arson cannot be taken as a reason, since without arson it would be the same.","The French ascribed the burning of Moscow au patriotisme féroce de Rastopchine;[561] the Russians—to the savagery of the French. Yet in reality, with regard to the burning of Moscow, there were not and could not be any reasons for placing the responsibility for it on one or several persons. Moscow burned down because it was put into conditions in which any wooden town would have to burn down, regardless of whether the town had or did not have a hundred and thirty poor-quality fire pumps. Moscow had to burn down, because its inhabitants left it, and as inevitably as a pile of wood chips has to catch fire if sparks pour down on it for several days. A wooden town in which, in the presence of the inhabitants who own the houses and of the police, there are fires almost every day during the summer, cannot help burning down when there are no inhabitants there, but troops smoking pipes, making campfires on Senate Square out of the Senate's chairs, and cooking meals twice a day. Billet troops in the villages of some area during peacetime, and the number of fires in that area increases at once. How much greater, then, is the possibility of fires in an empty wooden town in which foreign troops are billeted? Le patriotisme féroce de Rastopcbine and the savagery of the French are not to blame for anything here. Moscow caught fire from the pipes, the kitchens, the carelessness of enemy soldiers, who were living in houses they did not own. If there was arson (which is very doubtful, because no one had any reason for it, and in any case it was troublesome and dangerous), that arson cannot be taken as the cause, since without any arson it would have been the same.","The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme féroce de Rastopchine,1 the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality however it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it. Moscow was burnt because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire-engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house-owners are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make camp-fires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals twice a day. In peace time it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district, and the number of fires in that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are quartered. Le patriotisme féroce de Rastopchine and the barbarity of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by the soldiers’ pipes, kitchens, and camp-fires, and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the houses—in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism."

Boris was dressed elegantly, with a touch of marching militancy.

"Бенигсен от Горок спустился по большой дороге к мосту, на который Пьеру указывал офицер с кургана как на центр позиции и у которого на берегу лежали ряды скошенной, пахнувшей сеном травы. Через мост они проехали в село Бородино, оттуда повернули влево и мимо огромного количества войск и пушек выехали к высокому кургану, на котором копали землю ополченцы. Это был редут, еще не имевший названия, потом получивший название редута Раевского, или курганной батареи.","Benigsen descended from Gorki along the high road to the bridge, to which the officer from the mound pointed out to Pierre as the center of the position, and near which rows of mowed grass, smelling of hay, lay on the bank.

It was a redoubt, which did not yet have a name, then it was called the Raevsky redoubt, or barrow battery.","From Gorki Bennigsen went down by the high road to the bridge that the officer on the barrow had pointed out to Pierre as the center of the position, and near which rows of mowed grass smelling of hay lay on the riverbank.

This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, later known as the Raevsky redoubt or the battery of the barrow.","FROM Gorky Bennigsen descended the high road to the bridge which, when they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being the centre of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside.

"Прежде чем ехать в армию, находившуюся в мае в Дрисском лагере, князь Андрей заехал в Лысые Горы, которые были на самой его дороге, находясь в трех верстах от Смоленского большака. Последние три года и жизни князя Андрея было так много переворотов, так много он передумал, перечувствовал, перевидел (он объехал и запад и восток), что его странно и неожиданно поразило при въезде в Лысые Горы все точно то же, до малейших подробностей, — точно то же течение жизни. Он, как в заколдованный, заснувший замок, въехал в аллею и в каменные ворота лысогорского дома. Та же степенность, та же чистота, та же тишина были в этом доме, те же мебели, те же стены, те же звуки, тот же запах и те же робкие лица, только несколько постаревшие. Княжна Марья была все та же робкая, некрасивая, стареющаяся девушка, в страхе и вечных нравственных страданиях, без пользы и радости проживающая лучшие годы своей жизни. Bourienne была та же радостно пользующаяся каждой минутой своей жизни и исполненная самых для себя радостных надежд, довольная собой, кокетливая девушка. Она только стала увереннее, как показалось князю Андрею. Привезенный им из Швейцарии воспитатель Десаль был одет в сюртук русского покроя, коверкая язык, говорил по-русски со слугами, но был все тот же ограниченно-умный, образованный, добродетельный и педантический воспитатель. Старый князь переменился физически только тем, что с боку рта у него стал заметен недостаток одного зуба; нравственно он был все такой же, как и прежде, только с еще большим озлоблением и недоверием к действительности того, что происходило в мире. Один только Николушка вырос, переменился, разрумянился, оброс курчавыми темными волосами и, сам не зная того, смеясь и веселясь, поднимал верхнюю губку хорошенького ротика точно так же, как ее поднимала покойница маленькая княгиня. Он один не слушался закона неизменности в этом заколдованном, спящем замке. Но хотя по внешности все оставалось по-старому, внутренние отношения всех этих лиц изменились, с тех пор как князь Андрей не видал их. Члены семейства были разделены на два лагеря, чуждые и враждебные между собой, которые сходились теперь только при нем, — для него изменяя свой обычный образ жизни. К одному принадлежали старый князь, m-lle Bourienne и архитектор, к другому — княжна Марья, Десаль, Николушка и все няньки и мамки.","Before leaving for the army, which was in the Drissa camp in May, Prince Andrei drove into Bald Mountains, which were on his very road, being three versts from the Smolensk highway. The last three years and the life of Prince Andrei were so many upheavals, he changed his mind, re-felt, re-saw so much (he traveled both west and east), that he was strangely and unexpectedly struck at the entrance to the Bald Mountains by everything exactly the same, to the smallest detail, - exactly the same course of life. He, like in an enchanted, sleeping castle, drove into the alley and into the stone gates of the Lysogorsky house. The same sedateness, the same cleanliness, the same silence were in this house, the same furniture, the same walls, the same sounds, the same smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, ugly, aging girl, in fear and eternal moral suffering, living the best years of her life without benefit and joy. Bourienne was the same joyfully enjoying every minute of her life and full of the most joyful hopes for herself, self-satisfied, coquettish girl. She only became more confident, as it seemed to Prince Andrei. The educator Dessalles, brought by him from Switzerland, was dressed in a frock coat of Russian cut, mangling his language, spoke Russian with the servants, but he was still the same limited-intelligent, educated, virtuous and pedantic educator. The old prince changed physically only by the fact that one missing tooth became noticeable on the side of his mouth; morally, he was still the same as before, only with even greater anger and distrust of the reality of what was happening in the world. Only Nikolushka grew, changed, flushed, overgrown with curly dark hair and, without knowing it, laughing and having fun, lifted the upper lip of his pretty mouth in the same way as the deceased little princess lifted it. He alone did not obey the law of immutability in this enchanted, sleeping castle. But although outwardly everything remained the same as before, the internal relations of all these persons had changed since Prince Andrei had not seen them. The members of the family were divided into two camps, alien and hostile to each other, which now converged only in his presence, changing their usual way of life for him. To one belonged the old prince, m lle Bourienne and the architect, to the other - Princess Mary, Dessalles, Nikolushka and all the nannies and mothers.","Before going to the army, which in May was encamped on the Drissa, Prince Andrei stopped at Bald Hills, which was directly on his way, being two miles from the Smolensk high road. In the last three years of Prince Andrei's life there had been so many upheavals, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the west and in the east), that on entering Bald Hills, he was strangely and unexpectedly struck that everything was exactly the same, to the smallest details—there was exactly the same course of life. He rode down the avenue and through the stone gates of the Bald Hills house as if into an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same staidness, the same cleanliness, the same silence were in this house, the same furniture, the same walls, the same sounds, the same smell, and the same timid faces, only grown slightly older. Princess Marya was the same timid, plain, aging maiden, uselessly and joylessly living through the best years of her life in fear and eternal moral suffering. Mlle Bourienne was the same coquettish girl, pleased with herself, joyfully making use of every moment of her life, and filled with the most joyful hopes for herself. She had only become surer of herself, as it seemed to Prince Andrei. The tutor Dessales, whom he had brought from Switzerland, was dressed in a frock coat of Russian cut, spoke distorted Russian with the servants, but was the same narrowly intelligent, well-educated, virtuous, and pedantic tutor. The old prince had changed physically only in that a missing tooth could be noticed on one side of his mouth; morally he was the same as before, only with more animosity and mistrust towards the reality of what was happening in the world. Nikolushka alone had grown, changed, become red-cheeked, with a head of dark curly hair and, unknowingly, when he was laughing and gay, he raised the upper lip of his pretty little mouth exactly as the deceased little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of changelessness in this enchanted, sleeping castle. But, though externally everything remained as before, the inner relations of all these persons had changed since Prince Andrei last saw them. The members of the family were divided into two camps, alien and hostile to each other, which came together now only because of him, changing their usual way of life for his sake. To one belonged the old prince, Mlle Bourienne, and the architect, to the other Princess Marya, Dessales, Nikolushka, and all the nurses and nannies.","Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrei visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only three versts off the Smolensk high road. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having travelled both in the east and the west) that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars, and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Marya was still the same timid, plain, maiden getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrei thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth: in character he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and scepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nikolai alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrei had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Marya, Dessalles, Nikolushka, and all the old nannies and maids."
"— De la Moskowa! [Под Москвою!] — повторил Наполеон, и, пригласив к своей прогулке господина Боссе, любившего путешествовать, он вышел из палатки к оседланным лошадям.","— De la Moskowa! [Near Moscow!] - repeated Napoleon, and, having invited Mr. Bosse, who loved to travel, to his walk, he left the tent to the saddled horses.","“De la Moskowa!” Napoleon repeated and, having invited Mr. Beausset, the lover of travel, for a promenade, he came out of the tent to the saddled horses.","‘De la Moskowa!’ repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride , he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled."

Князь Андрей неохотно, но разумно отвечал на все вопросы доктора и потом сказал, что ему надо бы подложить валик, а то неловко и очень больно. Доктор и камердинер подняли шинель, которою он был накрыт, и, морщась от тяжкого запаха гнилого мяса, распространявшегося от раны, стали рассматривать это страшное место. Доктор чем-то очень остался недоволен, что-то иначе переделал, перевернул раненого так, что тот опять застонал и от боли во время поворачивания опять потерял сознание и стал бредить. Он все говорил о том, чтобы ему достали поскорее эту книгу и подложили бы ее туда.","The doctor promised to get it and began to question the prince about how he felt. Prince Andrei reluctantly but reasonably answered all the doctor's questions and then said that he should have put a roller on him, otherwise it would be awkward and very painful. The doctor and the valet raised the overcoat with which he was covered, and, wincing at the heavy smell of rotten meat spreading from the wound, began to examine this terrible place. The doctor was very dissatisfied with something, altered something differently, turned the wounded man over so that he again groaned and, from pain during the turning, again lost consciousness and began to rave. He kept talking about getting this book as soon as possible and putting it there.","The doctor promised to get hold of it and began to ask the prince about what he felt.

"Пьер отрицательно покачал головой и пошел дальше. В другом переулке на него крикнул часовой, стоявший у зеленого ящика, и Пьер только на повторенный грозный крик и звук ружья, взятого часовым на руку, понял, что он должен был обойти другой стороной улицы. Он ничего не слышал и не видел вокруг себя. Он, как что-то страшное и чуждое ему, с поспешностью и ужасом нес в себе свое намерение, боясь — наученный опытом прошлой ночи — как-нибудь растерять его. Но Пьеру не суждено было донести в целости свое настроение до того места, куда он направлялся. Кроме того, ежели бы даже он и не был ничем задержан на пути, намерение его не могло быть исполнено уже потому, что Наполеон тому назад более четырех часов проехал из Дорогомиловского предместья через Арбат в Кремль и теперь в самом мрачном расположении духа сидел в царском кабинете кремлевского дворца и отдавал подробные, обстоятельные приказания о мерах, которые немедленно должны были быть приняты для тушения пожара, предупреждения мародерства и успокоения жителей. Но Пьер не знал этого; он, весь поглощенный предстоящим, мучился, как мучаются люди, упрямо предпринявшие дело невозможное — не по трудностям, но по несвойственности дела с своей природой; он мучился страхом того, что он ослабеет в решительную минуту и, вследствие того, потеряет уважение к себе.","Pierre shook his head negatively and went on. In another alley, a sentry standing at a green box shouted at him, and Pierre only realized at the repeated menacing cry and the sound of a gun taken by the sentry in his hand that he had to go around the other side of the street.

He, like something terrible and alien to him, with haste and horror carried his intention within himself, afraid - taught by the experience of the previous night - to somehow lose it. But Pierre was not destined to convey his mood intact to the place where he was heading. In addition, even if he had not been stopped by anything on the way, his intention could not have been carried out already because Napoleon had traveled more than four hours ago from the Dorogomilovsky suburb through the Arbat to the Kremlin and was now sitting in the tsar's office in the gloomiest mood.

It is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Moscovites,’ Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Hélène’s one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pavlovna’s one had to be ecstatic about it.

"— Что такое? Что такое? — спрашивал он, но товарищ его уже скакал по направлению к крикам, мимо Василия Блаженного. Офицер сел верхом и поехал за ним. Когда он подъехал к мосту, он увидал снятые с передков две пушки, пехоту, идущую по мосту, несколько поваленных телег, несколько испуганных лиц и смеющиеся лица солдат. Подле пушек стояла одна повозка, запряженная парой. За повозкой сзади колес жались четыре борзые собаки в ошейниках. На повозке была гора вещей, и на самом верху, рядом с детским, кверху ножками перевернутым стульчиком сидела баба, пронзительно и отчаянно визжавшая.

Толпа, валя повозки, давя друг друга, отчаянно кричала, теснясь, расчистила мост, и войска двинулись вперед.","- What's happened? What's happened? he asked, but his comrade was already galloping towards the screams, past St. Basil the Blessed. The officer mounted and rode after him. When he drove up to the bridge, he saw two cannons removed from the limbers, infantry walking along the bridge, several carts thrown down, several frightened faces and laughing faces of soldiers. Near the cannons stood one wagon drawn by a couple. Four collared greyhounds huddled behind the cart behind the wheels. There was a mountain of things on the cart, and at the very top, next to the nursery, a woman was sitting with her legs turned upside down, squealing piercingly and desperately. The comrades told the officer that the cry of the crowd and the squeals of the women came from the fact that General Yermolov, who had run into this crowd, having learned that the soldiers were dispersing around the shops, and crowds of residents were damming up the bridge, ordered to remove the guns from the limbers and make an example that he would shoot at the bridge . The crowd, knocking down the carts, crushing each other, shouted desperately, crowding, cleared the bridge, and the troops moved forward.","“What is it?

Near the cannon stood a cart hitched to two horses. Behind the cart, four wolfhounds in collars pressed up close to the wheels. The cart was heaped with chattels, and on the very top, next to a child's chair turned legs up, sat a woman, shrieking piercingly and desperately. His comrades told the officer that the cries of the crowd and the shrieking of the woman came from the fact that General Ermolov had come upon this crowd and, learning that the soldiers had scattered to the shops and crowds of inhabitants were blocking the bridge, had ordered the cannon dismounted from their carriages, and had pretended that he was about to fire on the bridge. The crowd, overturning carts, crushing each other, crying desperately, shoving, had cleared the bridge, and the troops were now moving forward.","‘What is it? What is it?’ he asked, but his comrade was already galloping off past Vasili the Blessed in the direction from which the screams came. The officer mounted his horse and rode after him.

Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child’s chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks.

The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward."

"— Сражение выиграет тот, кто твердо решил его выиграть. Отчего мы под Аустерлицем проиграли сражение? У нас потеря была почти равная с французами, но мы сказали себе очень рано, что мы проиграли сражение, — и проиграли. А сказали мы это потому, что нам там незачем было драться: поскорее хотелось уйти с поля сражения. «Проиграли — ну так бежать!» — мы и побежали. Ежели бы до вечера мы не говорили этого, бог знает что бы было. А завтра мы этого не скажем. Ты говоришь: наша позиция, левый фланг слаб, правый фланг растянут, — продолжал он, — все это вздор, ничего этого нет. А что нам предстоит завтра? Сто миллионов самых разнообразных случайностей, которые будут решаться мгновенно тем, что побежали или побегут они или наши, что убьют того, убьют другого; а то, что делается теперь, — все это забава. Дело в том, что те, с кем ты ездил по позиции, не только не содействуют общему ходу дел, но мешают ему. Они заняты только своими маленькими интересами.","The battle will be won by those who are determined to win it. Why did we lose the battle near Austerlitz? Our loss was almost equal to that of the French, but we told ourselves very early that we had lost the battle, and we did. And we said this because we had no reason to fight there: we wanted to leave the battlefield as soon as possible. ""We lost - well, run away!"" - we ran. If we had not said this until evening, God knows what would have happened. We won't say that tomorrow. You say: our position, the left flank is weak, the right flank is extended,” he continued, “all this is nonsense, there is nothing of it. And what do we have tomorrow? One hundred million of the most varied accidents that will be solved instantly by the fact that they or ours ran or run, that they kill one, kill another; and what is being done now is all fun. The fact is that those with whom you traveled around the position not only do not contribute to the general course of affairs, but interfere with it. They are only concerned with their little interests.","“A battle is won by him who is firmly resolved to win it. Why did we lose the battle of Austerlitz?

If we hadn't said it by evening, God knows what would have happened. But tomorrow we won't say it. You say: our position, the left flank is weak, the right is overextended,” he went on. “That's all nonsense, it amounts to nothing. But what faces us tomorrow? A hundred million of the most varied possibilities, which will be decided instantly by who runs or will run away, theirs or ours, by whether this one or that is killed; but what's being done now is all just an amusement. The thing is that the men you rode around the position with not only don't contribute to the general course of things, but hinder it.

"Грязная девка вышла из-за сундука, прибрала косу и, вздохнув, пошла тупыми босыми ногами вперед по тропинке. Пьер как бы вдруг очнулся к жизни после тяжелого обморока. Он выше поднял голову, глаза его засветились блеском жизни, и он быстрыми шагами пошел за девкой, обогнал ее и вышел на Поварскую. Вся улица была застлана тучей черного дыма. Языки пламени кое-где вырывались из этой тучи. Народ большой толпой теснился перед пожаром. В середине улицы стоял французский генерал и говорил что-то окружавшим его. Пьер, сопутствуемый девкой, подошел было к тому месту, где стоял генерал; но французские солдаты остановили его.","The dirty girl stepped out from behind the trunk, cleaned up her scythe, and, sighing, went forward with her blunt bare feet along the path. Pierre seemed to suddenly wake up to life after a severe fainting spell. He raised his head higher, his eyes lit up with the brilliance of life, and he quickly followed the girl, overtook her and went out to Povarskaya. The whole street was covered with a cloud of black smoke. Tongues of flame escaped from this cloud here and there. People crowded in front of the fire in a large crowd. In the middle of the street stood a French general and said something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by a girl, went up to the place where the general was standing; but the French soldiers stopped him.","The dirty wench came from behind the trunk, fixed up her braid, sighed, and walked down the path on her blunt, bare feet.

"— Возьми, возьми ребенка, — проговорил Пьер, подавая девочку и повелительно и поспешно обращаясь к бабе. — Ты отдай им, отдай! — закричал он почти на бабу, сажая закричавшую девочку на землю, и опять оглянулся на французов и на армянское семейство. Старик уже сидел босой. Маленький француз снял с него последний сапог и похлопывал сапогами один о другой. Старик, всхлипывая, говорил что-то, но Пьер только мельком видел это; все внимание его было обращено на француза в капоте, который в это время, медлительно раскачиваясь, подвинулся к молодой женщине и, вынув руки из карманов, взялся за ее шею.","“Take, take the child,” Pierre said, handing the girl and imperiously and hastily addressing the woman.

"Князь Андрей приехал в Царево-Займище в тот самый день и в то самое время дня, когда Кутузов делал первый смотр войскам. Князь Андрей остановился в деревне у дома священника, у которого стоял экипаж главнокомандующего, и сел на лавочке у ворот, ожидая светлейшего, как все называли теперь Кутузова. На поле за деревней слышны были то звуки полковой музыки, то рев огромного количества голосов, кричавших «ура!» новому главнокомандующему. Тут же у ворот, шагах в десяти от князя Андрея, пользуясь отсутствием князя и прекрасной погодой, стояли два денщика, курьер и дворецкий.

"Когда молились за воинство, она вспомнила брата и Денисова. Когда молились за плавающих и путешествующих, она вспомнила князя Андрея и молилась за него, и молилась за то, чтобы бог простил ей то зло, которое она ему сделала. Когда молились за любящих нас, она молилась о своих домашних, об отце, матери, Соне, в первый раз теперь понимая всю свою вину перед ними и чувствуя всю силу своей любви к ним. Когда молились о ненавидящих нас, она придумала себе врагов и ненавидящих для того, чтобы молиться за них. Она причисляла к врагам кредиторов и всех тех, которые имели дело с ее отцом, и всякий раз, при мысли о врагах и ненавидящих, она вспоминала Анатоля, сделавшего ей столько зла, и хотя он не был ненавидящий, она радостно молилась за него как за врага. Только на молитве она чувствовала себя в силах ясно и спокойно вспоминать и о князе Андрее, и об Анатоле, как об людях, к которым чувства ее уничтожались в сравнении с ее чувством страха и благоговения к богу. Когда молились за царскую фамилию и за Синод, она особенно низко кланялась и крестилась, говоря себе, что, ежели она не понимает, она не может сомневаться и все-таки любит правительствующий Синод и молится за него.","When they prayed for the army, she remembered her brother and Denisov.

"И не Наполеон распоряжался ходом сраженья, потому что из диспозиции его ничего не было исполнено и во время сражения он не знал про то, что происходило впереди его.

Наполеону казалось только, что все дело происходило по воле его. И потому вопрос о том, был ли или не был у Наполеона насморк, не имеет для истории большего интереса, чем вопрос о насморке последнего фурштатского солдата.","And it was not Napoleon who controlled the course of the battle, because nothing from his disposition was executed and during the battle he did not know about what was happening ahead of him.

"По Петербургу мгновенно распространился слух не о том, что Элен хочет развестись с своим мужем (ежели бы распространился этот слух, очень многие восстали бы против такого незаконного намерения), но прямо распространился слух о том, что несчастная, интересная Элен находится в недоуменье о том, за кого из двух ей выйти замуж. Вопрос уже не состоял в том, в какой степени это возможно, а только в том, какая партия выгоднее и как двор посмотрит на это. Были действительно некоторые закоснелые люди, не умевшие подняться на высоту вопроса и видевшие в этом замысле поругание таинства брака; но таких было мало, и они молчали, большинство же интересовалось вопросами о счастии, которое постигло Элен, и какой выбор лучше. О том же, хорошо ли или дурно выходить от живого мужа замуж, не говорили, потому что вопрос этот, очевидно, был уже решенный для людей поумнее нас с вами (как говорили) и усомниться в правильности решения вопроса значило рисковать выказать свою глупость и неумение жить в свете.","A rumor instantly spread throughout Petersburg, not that Helen wanted to divorce her husband (if this rumor spread, very many would rebel against such an illegal intention), but a rumor spread directly that the unfortunate, interesting Helen was at a loss about which of the two she should marry. The question was no longer to what extent this was possible, but only which party was more profitable and how the court would look at it. There were indeed some inveterate people who did not know how to rise to the height of the question and saw in this plan a desecration of the sacrament of marriage; but there were few of them, and they were silent, while most were interested in questions about the happiness that befell Helen, and what choice is better. They didn’t talk about whether it’s good or bad to marry a living husband, because this question, obviously, had already been resolved for people smarter than you and me (as they said) and to doubt the correctness of the solution of the issue meant to risk showing their stupidity and inability live in the light.","The rumor instantly spread through Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to divorce her husband (if such a rumor had spread, a great many people would have risen up against such an unlawful intention), but simply that the unfortunate, interesting Hélène was in perplexity about which of the two men to marry. The question now consisted not in the degree to which this was possible, but only in which match was the more advantageous and how the court would look at it. There were indeed some obdurate people who were unable to rise to the height of the question and saw in this project a profanation of the sacrament of marriage; but they were few, and they kept quiet, while the majority was interested in the questions of the happiness that had befallen Hélène and which choice was better. As for whether it was good or bad to marry while one's husband was living, no one spoke of it, because this question had obviously already been decided by people more intelligent than you and I (as they said), and to doubt the correctness of the decision would mean to risk showing one's stupidity and inability to live in society.","A rumour immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and interesting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry. The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested in Hélène’s good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to re-marry while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people ‘wiser than you or me’, as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one’s stupidity and incapacity to live in society."
"Пьер, задыхаясь от радости, подбежал к девочке и хотел взять ее на руки. Но, увидав чужого человека, золотушно-болезненная, похожая на мать, неприятная на вид девочка закричала и бросилась бежать. Пьер, однако, схватил ее и поднял на руки; она завизжала отчаянно-злобным голосом и своими маленькими ручонками стала отрывать от себя руки Пьера и сопливым ртом кусать их. Пьера охватило чувство ужаса и гадливости, подобное тому, которое он испытывал при прикосновении к какому-нибудь маленькому животному. Но он сделал усилие над собою, чтобы не бросить ребенка, и побежал с ним назад к большому дому. Но пройти уже нельзя было назад той же дорогой; девки Аниски уже не было, и Пьер с чувством жалости и отвращения, прижимая к себе как можно нежнее страдальчески всхлипывавшую и мокрую девочку, побежал через сад искать другого выхода.","Pierre, choking with joy, ran up to the girl and wanted to take her in his arms. But, seeing a stranger, the scrofulous, sickly, mother-like, unpleasant-looking girl screamed and rushed to run. Pierre, however, grabbed her and lifted her up; she squealed in a desperately angry voice and with her small hands began to tear Pierre's hands away from her and bite them with a snotty mouth. Pierre was seized by a feeling of horror and disgust, similar to that which he experienced when he touched some small animal. But he made an effort on himself not to abandon the child, and ran with him back to the big house. But it was no longer possible to go back the same way; the girl Aniska was no longer there, and Pierre, with a feeling of pity and disgust, clutching the sobbing and wet girl as tenderly as possible, ran through the garden to look for another way out.","Pierre, breathless with joy, ran to the girl and wanted to pick her up.

She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre’s hands away, and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down, and ran with her to the large house.

"При виде странного города с невиданными формами необыкновенной архитектуры Наполеон испытывал то несколько завистливое и беспокойное любопытство, которое испытывают люди при виде форм не знающей о них, чуждой жизни. Очевидно, город этот жил всеми силами своей жизни. По тем неопределимым признакам, по которым на дальнем расстоянии безошибочно узнается живое тело от мертвого. Наполеон с Поклонной горы видел трепетание жизни в городе и чувствовал как бы дыханио этого большого и красивого тела.","At the sight of a strange city with unprecedented forms of extraordinary architecture, Napoleon experienced that somewhat envious and restless curiosity that people experience when they see the forms of an alien life that does not know about them. Obviously, this city lived with all the forces of its life. By those indefinable signs by which, at a long distance, a living body is unmistakably recognized from a dead one. Napoleon from Poklonnaya Gora saw the trembling of life in the city and felt, as it were, the breath of this large and beautiful body.","At the sight of the strange city with the never-seen forms of its extraordinary architecture, Napoleon experienced that somewhat envious and restless curiosity which people experience at the sight of alien forms of life that know nothing of them.

"Ежели от воли Наполеона зависело дать или не дать Бородинское сражение и от его воли зависело сделать такое или другое распоряжение, то очевидно, что насморк, имевший влияние на проявление его воли, мог быть причиной спасения России и что поэтому тот камердинер, который забыл подать Наполеону 24-го числа непромокаемые сапоги, был спасителем России. На этом пути мысли вывод этот несомненен, — так же несомненен, как тот вывод, который, шутя (сам не зная над чем), делал Вольтер, говоря, что Варфоломеевская ночь произошла от расстройства желудка Карла IX. Но для людей, не допускающих того, чтобы Россия образовалась по воле одного человека — Петра I, и чтобы Французская империя сложилась и война с Россией началась по воле одного человека — Наполеона, рассуждение это не только представляется неверным, неразумным, но и противным всему существу человеческому. На вопрос о том, что составляет причину исторических событий, представляется другой ответ, заключающийся в том, что ход мировых событий предопределен свыше, зависит от совпадения всех произволов людей, участвующих в этих событиях, и что влияние Наполеонов на ход этих событий есть только внешнее и фиктивное.","If it depended on the will of Napoleon to give or not to give the Battle of Borodino, and it depended on his will to make such or another order, then it is obvious that a runny nose, which had an influence on the manifestation of his will, could be the reason for the salvation of Russia and that therefore the valet who forgot to give Napoleon On the 24th, waterproof boots, was the savior of Russia. On this path of thought, this conclusion is undoubted, just as undoubted as the conclusion that Voltaire, joking (he did not know what), when he said that Bartholomew's night came from the stomach upset of Charles IX. But for people who do not allow Russia to be formed at the behest of one person - Peter I, and for the French Empire to take shape and the war with Russia to begin at the behest of one person - Napoleon, this reasoning not only seems incorrect, unreasonable, but also contrary to the whole being. human. To the question of what constitutes the cause of historical events, another answer appears, which is that the course of world events is predetermined from above, depends on the coincidence of all the wills of the people participating in these events, and that the influence of Napoleons on the course of these events is only external and fictitious.","If it had depended on Napoleon's will whether or not to fight the battle of Borodino, and if it had depended on his will whether to give this or that instruction, then it is obvious that a cold, having an influence on the expression of his will, could have caused the salvation of Russia, and therefore the valet who forgot to give Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth was the savior of Russia. By that way of thinking, this conclusion is indubitable— as indubitable as the conclusion which Voltaire drew jokingly (not knowing at what himself) when he said that the night of St. Bartholomew was the result of Charles IX having an upset stomach.[247] But for people who do not admit that Russia was shaped by the will of one man—Peter I—and that the French empire arose and the war with Russia began by the will of one man—Napoleon— this argument seems not only incorrect, unreasonable, but also contrary to all human essence. To the question of what constitutes the cause of historical events, a different answer presents itself, which is that the course of world events is predestined from on high, depends on the coincidence of all the wills of the people participating in those events, and that Napoleon's influence on the course of those events is only external and fictitious.","If it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof-boots on the 24th would have been the saviour of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he said that the Massacre of St Bartholomew was due to Charles IX’s stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic events, another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on high—depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon’s influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious."

"Бенигсен, выбрав позицию, горячо выставляя свой русский патриотизм (которого не мог, не морщась, выслушивать Кутузов), настаивал на защите Москвы. Кутузов ясно как день видел цель Бенигсена: в случае неудачи защиты — свалить вину на Кутузова, доведшего войска без сражения до Воробьевых гор, а в случае успеха — себе приписать его; в случае же отказа — очистить себя в преступлении оставления Москвы. Но этот вопрос интриги не занимал теперь старого человека. Один страшный вопрос занимал его. И на вопрос этот он ни от кого не слышал ответа. Вопрос состоял для него теперь только в том: «Неужели это я допустил до Москвы Наполеона, и когда же я это сделал? Когда это решилось? Неужели вчера, когда я послал к Платову приказ отступить, или третьего дня вечером, когда я задремал и приказал Бенигсену распорядиться? Или еще прежде?.. но когда, когда же решилось это страшное дело? Москва должна быть оставлена. Войска должны отступить, и надо отдать это приказание». Отдать это страшное приказание казалось ему одно и то же, что отказаться от командования армией. А мало того, что он любил власть, привык к ней (почет, отдаваемый князю Прозоровскому, при котором он состоял в Турции, дразнил его), он был убежден, что ему было предназначено спасение России и что потому только, против воли государя и по воле народа, он был избрал главнокомандующим. Он был убежден, что он один и этих трудных условиях мог держаться во главе армии, что он один во всем мире был в состоянии без ужаса знать своим противником непобедимого Наполеона; и он ужасался мысли о том приказании, которое он должен был отдать. Но надо было решить что-нибудь, надо было прекратить эти разговоры вокруг него, которые начинали принимать слишком свободный характер.","Benigsen, choosing a position, ardently exposing his Russian patriotism (which Kutuzov could not listen to without wincing), insisted on defending Moscow. Kutuzov clearly saw Benigsen's goal as clear as day: in case of failure of the defense, to shift the blame on Kutuzov, who brought the troops without a battle to Sparrow Hills, and in case of success, to attribute it to himself; in case of refusal, to purge oneself of the crime of leaving Moscow. But this question of intrigue did not occupy the old man now. One terrible question occupied him. And he did not hear the answer to this question from anyone. The only question for him now was: “Is it possible that I allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do this? When was it decided? Was it really yesterday, when I sent the order to Platov to retreat, or on the evening of the third day, when I dozed off and ordered Benigsen to give orders? Or even before?.. but when, when was this terrible thing decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The troops must retreat, and this order must be given. To give this terrible order seemed to him one and the same thing as to refuse command of the army. And not only did he love power, got used to it (the honor given to Prince Prozorovsky, under whom he was in Turkey, teased him), he was convinced that the salvation of Russia was destined for him and that because only, against the will of the sovereign and according to the will of the people, he was elected commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone, and under these difficult conditions, could keep at the head of the army, that he alone in the whole world was able to know the invincible Napoleon as his opponent without horror; and he was horrified at the thought of the command he was to give. But something had to be decided, it was necessary to stop these conversations around him, which were beginning to take on a too free character.","Bennigsen, having chosen the position, ardently displaying his patriotism (which Kutuzov could not listen to without wincing), insisted on defending Moscow. Kutuzov saw Bennigsen's aim as clear as day: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutuzov, who had led the troops as far as Sparrow Hills without a battle; if it succeeded, to ascribe it to himself; in case of refusal—to clear himself of criminally abandoning Moscow. But this question of intrigue did not concern the old man now. One terrible question concerned him. And he heard no answer to this question from anyone. For him the question now consisted only in this: “Can it be that I allowed Napoleon to get as far as Moscow? And when, then, did I do it? When was it decided? Was it yesterday, when I sent Platov the order to retreat, or was it the evening before, when I dozed off and told Bennigsen to give the orders? Or still earlier? ... But when, when was this terrible matter decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The troops must retreat, and the order has to be given.” To give this terrible order seemed to him the same as giving up command of the army. And it was not just that he loved power and was used to it (the honors given to Prince Pro-zorovsky, to whom he had been attached in Turkey, piqued him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia, and only because of that, against the will of the sovereign and by the will of the people, was he chosen commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone, in those difficult circumstances, could maintain himself at the head of the army, and that he alone in the whole world was capable of knowing without dread that his adversary was the invincible Napoleon; and he dreaded the thought of the order he had to give. But he had to decide something, had to stop these conversations around him, which were beginning to take on too free a character.","Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian patriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight to Kutuzov: if the defence failed, to throw the blame on Kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man’s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now was: ‘Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to retreat, or was it the evening before when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still? … When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given.’ To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power, to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovsky, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor’s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen commander-in-chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped."

Балашев, бывший все время обеда настороже, отвечал, что comme tout chemin mene a Rome, tout chemin mene a Moscou, [как всякая дорога, по пословице, ведет в Рим, так и все дороги ведут в Москву, ] что есть много дорог, и что в числе этих разных путей есть дорога на Полтаву, которую избрал Карл XII, сказал Балашев, невольно вспыхнув от удовольствия в удаче этого ответа. Не успел Балашев досказать последних слов: «Poltawa», как уже Коленкур заговорил о неудобствах дороги из Петербурга в Москву и о своих петербургских воспоминаниях.","From the indifferent and perplexed faces of the gentlemen of the marshals, it was clear that they were perplexed, what was the witticism, which was hinted at by Balashev's intonation. “If she was, then we did not understand her or she is not at all witty,” said the facial expressions of the marshals. This answer was so little appreciated that Napoleon did not even notice it resolutely and naively asked Balashev about which cities there was a direct road to Moscow from here. Balashev, who was on his guard all the time of dinner, answered that comme tout chemin mene a Rome, tout chemin mene a Moscou, [as every road, according to the proverb, leads to Rome, so all roads lead to Moscow,] that there are many roads, and that among these different paths is the road to Poltava, which was chosen by Charles XII, said Balashev, involuntarily flushing with pleasure at the success of this answer. Before Balashev had time to say the last words: “Poltawa,” Caulaincourt was already talking about the inconvenience of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and about his Petersburg memories.","From the indifferent and puzzled faces of the gentlemen marshals, one could see that they were puzzled by exactly what constituted the wittiness here, which Balashov's intonation implied. “If there was any, we didn't understand it, or else it wasn't witty at all,” said the expressions of the marshals' faces. So little was this reply appreciated that Napoleon even decidedly failed to notice it and naively asked Balashov through what towns the direct route from there to Moscow passed. Balashov, who was on the alert all through dinner, replied that comme tout chemin mène à Rome, tout chemin mène à Moscou,[414] that there were many roads, and that among those various roads was the road through Poltawa, which had been chosen by Charles XII, said Balashov, involuntarily blushing with pleasure at the happy response.[197] Balashov had not managed to finish saying the final word, “Poltawa,” before Caulaincourt began talking about the inconvenience of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and about his Petersburg memories.","The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what Balashov’s tone suggested. ‘If there is a point we don’t see it, or it is not at all witty,’ their expressions seemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at all, and naively asked Balashov through what towns the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashov, who was on the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as ‘comme tout chemin mène à Rome, tout chemin mène à Moscou’:1 there were many roads, and ‘among them the road through Poltawa,* which Charles XII chose’. Balashov involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptness of this reply, but hardly had he uttered the word ‘Poltawa’ before Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences."
"Этот ответ Балашева, намекавший на недавнее поражение французов в Испании, был высоко оценен впоследствии, по рассказам Балашева, при дворе императора Александра и очень мало был оценен теперь, за обедом Наполеона, и прошел незаметно.","This answer by Balashev, hinting at the recent defeat of the French in Spain, was later highly appreciated, according to Balashev's stories, at the court of Emperor Alexander and very little appreciated now, at Napoleon's dinner, and passed unnoticed.","This reply of Balashov's, alluding to the recent defeat of the French in Spain,[196] was highly appreciated later on, according to Balashov's account, at the court of the emperor Alexander, but very little appreciated now, at Napoleon's dinner, and went unnoticed.","This reply of Balashov’s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the French in Spain,* was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander’s court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon’s dinner, where it passed unnoticed."

"За обедом, посадив подле себя Балашева, он обращался с ним не только ласково, но обращался так, как будто он и Балашева считал в числе своих придворных, в числе тех людей, которые сочувствовали его планам и должны были радоваться его успехам. Между прочим разговором он заговорил о Москве и стал спрашивать Балашева о русской столице, не только как спрашивает любознательный путешественник о новом месте, которое он намеревается посетить, но как бы с убеждением, что Балашев, как русский, должен быть польщен этой любознательностью.","At dinner, having seated Balashev next to him, he treated him not only affectionately, but treated him as if he considered Balashev among his courtiers, among those people who sympathized with his plans and should have rejoiced at his successes.

"«Но разве могло быть иначе? — подумал он. — Вот она, эта столица, у моих ног, ожидая судьбы своей. Где теперь Александр и что думает он? Странный, красивый, величественный город! И странная и величественная эта минута! В каком свете представляюсь я им! — думал он о своих войсках. — Вот она, награда для всех этих маловерных, — думал он, оглядываясь на приближенных и на подходившие и строившиеся войска. — Одно мое слово, одно движение моей руки, и погибла эта древняя столица des Czars.

На древних памятниках варварства и деспотизма я напишу великие слова справедливости и милосердия… Александр больнее всего поймет именно это, я знаю его.

С высот Кремля, — да, это Кремль, да, — я дам им законы справедливости, я покажу им значение истинной цивилизации, я заставлю поколения бояр с любовью поминать имя своего завоевателя. Я скажу депутации, что я не хотел и не хочу войны; что я вел войну только с ложной политикой их двора, что я люблю и уважаю Александра и что приму условия мира в Москве, достойные меня и моих народов. Я не хочу воспользоваться счастьем войны для унижения уважаемого государя. Бояре — скажу я им: я не хочу войны, а хочу мира и благоденствия всех моих подданных.

"Нам пресерьезно говорят ученые военные, что Кутузов еще гораздо прежде Филей должен был двинуть войска на Калужскую дорогу, что даже кто-то предлагал таковой проект. Но перед главнокомандующим, особенно в трудную минуту, бывает не один проект, а всегда десятки одновременно. И каждый из этих проектов, основанных на стратегии и тактике, противоречит один другому. Дело главнокомандующего, казалось бы, состоит только в том, чтобы выбрать один из этих проектов. Но и этого он не может сделать. События и время не ждут. Ему предлагают, положим, 28-го числа перейти на Калужскую дорогу, но в это время прискакивает адъютант от Милорадовича и спрашивает, завязывать ли сейчас дело с французами или отступить. Ему надо сейчас, сию минуту, отдать приказанье. А приказанье отступить сбивает нас с поворота на Калужскую дорогу. И вслед за адъютантом интендант спрашивает, куда везти провиант, а начальник госпиталей — куда везти раненых; а курьер из Петербурга привозит письмо государя, не допускающее возможности оставить Москву, а соперник главнокомандующего, тот, кто подкапывается под него (такие всегда есть, и не один, а несколько), предлагает новый проект, диаметрально противоположный плану выхода на Калужскую дорогу; а силы самого главнокомандующего требуют сна и подкрепления; а обойденный наградой почтенный генерал приходит жаловаться, а жители умоляют о защите; посланный офицер для осмотра местности приезжает и доносит совершенно противоположное тому, что говорил перед ним посланный офицер; а лазутчик, пленный и делавший рекогносцировку генерал — все описывают различно положение неприятельской армии. Люди, привыкшие не понимать или забывать эти необходимые условия деятельности всякого главнокомандующего, представляют нам, например, положение войск в Филях и при этом предполагают, что главнокомандующий мог 1-го сентября совершенно свободно разрешать вопрос об оставлении или защите Москвы, тогда как при положении русской армии в пяти верстах от Москвы вопроса этого не могло быть. Когда же решился этот вопрос? И под Дриссой, и под Смоленском, и ощутительнее всего 24-го под Шевардиным, и 26-го под Бородиным, и в каждый день, и час, и минуту отступления от Бородина до Филей.","We are seriously told by military scientists that Kutuzov, much earlier than Filey, had to move troops to the Kaluga road, that even someone proposed such a project. But before the commander in chief, especially in difficult times, there is not one project, but always dozens at the same time. And each of these projects, based on strategy and tactics, contradicts one another. The business of the commander-in-chief, it would seem, is only to choose one of these projects. But he cannot do that either. Events and time do not wait. He is offered, let's say, on the 28th, to go to the Kaluga road, but at that time Miloradovich's adjutant jumps up and asks whether to start dealing with the French now or retreat. He needs now, this minute, to give the order. And the order to retreat knocks us off the turn onto the Kaluga road. And following the adjutant, the quartermaster asks where to take provisions, and the head of hospitals - where to take the wounded; and a courier from St. Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign, which does not allow the possibility of leaving Moscow, and the rival of the commander-in-chief, the one who undermines him (there are always such, and not one, but several), proposes a new project, diametrically opposed to the plan for entering the Kaluga road; and the forces of the commander-in-chief himself require sleep and reinforcements; and the venerable general, who has been bypassed by the award, comes to complain, and the inhabitants plead for protection; a sent officer arrives to inspect the area and reports the exact opposite of what the sent officer said before him; and the scout, the prisoner, and the reconnaissance general all describe the position of the enemy army in different ways. People who are accustomed to not understanding or forgetting these necessary conditions for the activity of any commander in chief present us, for example, the position of the troops in Fili and at the same time assume that the commander in chief could completely freely resolve the issue of leaving or defending Moscow on September 1, while in the situation of the Russian army five miles from Moscow, this question could not be. When was this issue resolved? And near Drissa, and near Smolensk, and most palpably on the 24th near Shevardin, and on the 26th near Borodin, and every day, and hour, and minute of the retreat from Borodino to Fili.","Learned military men tell us quite seriously that Kutuzov ought to have moved his troops to the Kaluga road long before Fili, that someone had even suggested such a plan. But a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has before him not one plan, but always dozens simultaneously. And all these plans, based on strategy and tactics, contradict each other. The work of the commander in chief seems to be merely to choose one of these plans. But he cannot even do that. Events and time do not wait. Suppose a suggestion is made to move to the Kaluga road on the twenty-eighth, but just then an adjutant comes galloping from Miloradovich and asks whether they should go into action against the French now or retreat. An order must be given at once, that minute. And the order to retreat deflects us from the turnoff to the Kaluga road. After the adjutant, a commissary comes asking where to transport the food supplies, and the head of the hospitals asking where to transport the wounded; and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign that does not admit the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander's rival, the one who tries to undermine him (there are always rivals—not one, but several), suggests a new plan, diametrically opposed to the plan of going to the Kaluga road; and the commander's own forces require sleep and fortification; and a venerable general, overlooked for a reward, comes to complain, and the inhabitants beg for protection; and an officer sent to survey the terrain comes and reports the complete opposite of what an officer sent out before him had said; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who did some reconnoitering all describe the position of the enemy army differently. People accustomed to not understanding or to forgetting all these unavoidable conditions of the activity of any commander in chief present to us, for instance, the position of the army at Fili and in so doing suppose that on the first of September the commander in chief could quite freely decide the question of whether to abandon or defend Moscow, whereas, with the Russian army positioned within three miles of Moscow, this question could not exist. When, then, was the question decided? At Drissa, and at Smolensk, and most palpably at Shevardino on the twenty-fourth, on the twenty-sixth at Borodino, and every day, hour, and minute of our retreat from Borodino to Fili.","Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov should have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching Fili, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander-in-chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based on strategies and tactics, contradict each other. A commander-in-chief’s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not wait. For instance, on the 28th it is suggested to him to cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary-general asking where the stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander-in-chief’s rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kaluga road, and the commander-in-chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy, and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent, and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy’s army differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander-in-chief’s actions describe to us, for instance, the position of the army at Fili and assume that the commander-in-chief could, on the 1st of September, quite freely decide whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that question been settled? At Drissa, and at Smolensk, and most palpably of all on the 24th of August at Shevardino and on the 26th at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from Borodino to Fili."

"Весь день она жила только надеждой того, что ночью она уввдит его. Но теперь, когда наступила эта минута, на нее нашел ужас того, что она увидит. Как он был изуродован? Что оставалось от него?

But the thing was that the count was highly indignant. ' How could you have written it?' says the count. He took the Hamburg Gazette from the table.[259] 'It's here. You didn't write it, you translated it, and badly at that, because, fool that you are, you don't even know French.' And what do you think? ' No,' he says, 'I didn't read any newspapers, I wrote it myself.' ' If so, you're a traitor , I'll have you up in court, and you'll be hanged. Tell me, who did you get it from?' ' I haven't seen any newspapers, I wrote it.' And so it remained. The count summoned his father: he stood his ground. They took him to court and sentenced him, I believe, to hard labor. Now his father has come to petition for him. But what a nasty boy! You know that sort of little merchant's son, a dandy, a charmer, he listened to some lectures and thinks he can pluck the devil by the beard. Quite the fellow! His father keeps an inn here by the Kamenny Bridge, and in that inn there's a big icon of God Almighty, you know, holding a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other; so he took the icon home for a few days, and what did he do! He found some scoundrel of a painter...”","‘Not at all,’ rejoined the adjutant in dismay. ‘Klyucharyov had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. “How could you have written it yourself?” said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that was lying on the table. “Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don’t even know French, you fool.” And what do you think? “No,” said he, “I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.” “ If that’s so you’re a traitor and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say from whom you had it.” “I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.” And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labour, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That’s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a sceptre in the one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do? He found some scoundrel of a painter …’"

Казалось то, что дымы эти бежали, то, что они стояли, и мимо них бежали леса, поля и блестящие штыки. С левой стороны, по полям и кустам, беспрестанно зарождались эти большие дымы с своими торжественными отголосками, и ближе еще, по низам и лесам, вспыхивали маленькие, не успевавшие округляться дымки ружей и точно так же давали свои маленькие отголоски.

It seemed that these smokes were running, that they were standing, and forests, fields and shiny bayonets were running past them. On the left side, over the fields and bushes, these large smokes with their solemn echoes were constantly born, and closer still, along the lower levels and forests, small smokes of guns, which did not have time to round off, flared up and gave their small echoes in the same way.

But Prince Andrei's soul was not in a normal state in this respect, The forces of his soul were all clearer and more active than ever, but they acted outside his will. The most diverse thoughts and notions took hold of him simultaneously. Sometimes his thought suddenly began to work, and with such strength, clarity, and depth as it had never been able to do in healthy conditions; but suddenly, in the middle of its work, it broke off and was replaced by some unexpected notion, and he was unable to return to it.","His mind was not in a normal state.

But Prince Andrei’s mind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will.

"Марья Генриховна была жена полкового доктора, молодая, хорошенькая немка, на которой доктор женился в Польше. Доктор, или оттого, что не имел средств, или оттого, что не хотел первое время женитьбы разлучаться с молодой женой, возил ее везде за собой при гусарском полку, и ревность доктора сделалась обычным предметом шуток между гусарскими офицерами.","Marya Genrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a young, pretty German woman whom the doctor had married in Poland.

"Несколько мгновений после того, как затихли перекаты выстрелов по каменному Кремлю, странный звук послышался над головами французов. Огромная стая галок поднялась над стенами и, каркая и шумя тысячами крыл, закружилась в воздухе. Вместе с этим звуком раздался человеческий одинокий крик в воротах, и из-за дыма появилась фигура человека без шапки, в кафтане. Держа ружье, он целился во французов. Feu! — повторил артиллерийский офицер, и в одно и то же время раздались один ружейный и два орудийных выстрела. Дым опять закрыл ворота.","A few moments after the rolling of shots on the stone Kremlin had died down, a strange sound was heard over the heads of the French. A huge flock of jackdaws rose above the walls and, croaking and rustling with thousands of wings, circled in the air. Together with this sound, a lonely human cry was heard at the gate, and from behind the smoke appeared the figure of a man without a hat, in a caftan. Holding a gun, he aimed at the French. Feu! the artillery officer repeated, and at the same time one rifle and two gun shots rang out. The smoke closed the gate again.","A few moments after the rolling of the shots over the stone Kremlin died away, a strange noise was heard over the heads of the French.

The gate was again hidden by smoke."
"Он очень хорошо знал, что это сам Наполеон, и присутствие Наполеона не могло смутить его больше, чем присутствие Ростова или вахмистра с розгами, потому что не было ничего у него, чего бы не мог лишить его ни вахмистр, ни Наполеон.","He knew very well that it was Napoleon himself, and the presence of Napoleon could not embarrass him more than the presence of Rostov or the sergeant with rods, because he had nothing that neither the sergeant nor Napoleon could deprive him of.","He knew very well that this was Napoleon himself, and the presence of Napoleon could not throw him off any more than the presence of Rostov or of a sergeant major with a whip, because there was nothing he could be deprived of either by a sergeant major or by Napoleon.","He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon’s presence could no more intimidate him than Rostov’s, or a sergeant-major’s with the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant-major or Napoleon could deprive him of."
"Получив все приказания, Алпатыч, провожаемый домашними, в белой пуховой шляпе (княжеский подарок), с палкой, так же как князь, вышел садиться в кожаную кибиточку, заложенную тройкой сытых саврасых.","Having received all the orders, Alpatych, escorted by his family, in a white downy hat (a princely gift), with a stick, just like the prince, went out to sit in a leather wagon laid by a trio of well-fed savras.","Having received all his orders, Alpatych, accompanied by the domestics, in a white felt hat (the prince's gift), with a stick, just like the prince, came out to get into the little leather kibitka, harnessed to a troika of well-fed roans.","Having received all his orders Alpatych, wearing a white beaver hat—a present from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out accompanied by his family.

"Князь Андрей освежился немного, выехав из района пыли большой дороги, по которой двигались войска. Но недалеко за Лысыми Горами он въехал опять на дорогу и догнал свой полк на привале, у плотины небольшого пруда. Был второй час после полдня. Солнце, красный шар в пыли, невыносимо пекло и жгло спину сквозь черный сюртук. Пыль, все такая же, неподвижно стояла над говором гудевшими, остановившимися войсками. Ветру не было. В проезд по плотине на князя Андрея пахнуло тиной и свежестью пруда. Ему захотелось в воду — какая бы грязная она ни была. Он оглянулся на пруд, с которого неслись крики и хохот. Небольшой мутный с зеленью пруд, видимо, поднялся четверти на две, заливая плотину, потому что он был полон человеческими, солдатскими, голыми барахтавшимися в нем белыми телами, с кирпично-красными руками, лицами и шеями. Все это голое, белое человеческое мясо с хохотом и гиком барахталось в этой грязной луже, как караси, набитые в лейку. Весельем отзывалось это барахтанье, и оттого оно особенно было грустно.","Prince Andrei refreshed himself a little, having left the dusty area of the high road along which the troops were moving. But not far beyond the Bald Mountains, he again drove onto the road and caught up with his regiment at a halt, by the dam of a small pond. It was the second hour after noon. The sun, a red ball in the dust, was unbearably hot and burned his back through his black coat. The dust, still the same, stood motionless over the voice of the humming, halted troops. There was no wind. On the way across the dam, Prince Andrey smelled of the mud and freshness of the pond. He wanted to get into the water, no matter how dirty it was. He looked back at the pond, from which cries and laughter were coming. A small muddy pond with greenery, apparently, rose a quarter by two, flooding the dam, because it was full of human, soldier, naked white bodies floundering in it, with brick-red hands, faces and necks. All this naked, white human meat, with laughter and a boom, floundered in this dirty puddle, like crucian carp stuffed into a watering can. This floundering echoed with merriment, and that was why it was especially sad.","Prince Andrei had been somewhat refreshed, leaving the dusty area of the high road along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills, he came back to the road and caught up with his regiment at a stopping place by a dam on a small pond. It was past one in the afternoon. The sun, a red ball in the dust, scorched and burned his back unbearably through his black tunic. Dust, the same as ever, hung motionless over the halted troops buzzing with talk. There was no wind. As he rode across the dam, Prince Andrei smelled the slime and freshness of the pond. He wanted to go into the water—however dirty it was. He glanced around at the pond, from which came shouts and loud laughter. The small, muddy green pond had evidently risen some eight inches, overflowing the dam, because it was filled with the naked human bodies of soldiers flopping about in it, white with brick-red hands, faces, and necks. All that naked, white human flesh, with whoops and guffaws, was flopping about in the dirty puddle like carp in a bucket. This flopping about suggested merriment, and that made it particularly sad.","Prince Andrei was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty high road along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting-place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o’clock.

There was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrei smelt the ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic."
"— Ах боже мой! Боже мой! Что ж это?.. Живот! Это конец! Ах боже мой! — слышались голоса между офицерами. — На волосок мимо уха прожужжала, — говорил адъютант.

"С поля сражения беспрестанно прискакивали к Наполеону его посланные адъютанты и ординарцы его маршалов с докладами о ходе дела; но все эти доклады были ложны: и потому, что в жару сражения невозможно сказать, что происходит в данную минуту, и потому, что многие адъютапты не доезжали до настоящего места сражения, а передавали то, что они слышали от других; и еще потому, что пока проезжал адъютант те две-три версты, которые отделяли его от Наполеона, обстоятельства изменялись и известие, которое он вез, уже становилось неверно. Так от вице-короля прискакал адъютант с известием, что Бородино занято и мост на Колоче в руках французов. Адъютант спрашивал у Наполеона, прикажет ли он переходить войскам? Наполеон приказал выстроиться на той стороне и ждать; но не только в то время как Наполеон отдавал это приказание, но даже когда адъютант только что отъехал от Бородина, мост уже был отбит и сожжен русскими, в той самой схватке, в которой участвовал Пьер в самом начале сраженья.","From the battlefield, his sent adjutants and orderlies of his marshals constantly jumped to Napoleon with reports on the progress of the case; but all these reports were false: both because in the heat of battle it is impossible to say what is happening at a given moment, and because many adjutants did not reach the real place of the battle, but transmitted what they heard from others; and also because while the adjutant was passing those two or three versts that separated him from Napoleon, circumstances changed and the news he was carrying was already becoming false. So an adjutant rode up from the viceroy with the news that Borodino was occupied and the bridge on Kolocha was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked Napoleon if he would order the troops to cross? Napoleon ordered to line up on the other side and wait; but not only while Napoleon was giving this order, but even when the adjutant had just left Borodino, the bridge had already been recaptured and burned by the Russians, in the very battle in which Pierre participated at the very beginning of the battle.","From the battlefield the adjutants he had sent and his marshals' orderlies constantly came galloping to Napoleon with reports on the course of events; but all these reports were false: both because in the heat of battle it is impossible to tell what is going on at a given moment, and because many of the adjutants did not reach the actual place of battle, but told what they had heard from others; and also because, while an adjutant was riding the mile or more that separated him from Napoleon, the circumstances changed, and the news he was bringing became incorrect. Thus an adjutant arrived from the viceroy with news that Borodino had been taken and the bridge over the Kolocha was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked Napoleon if he ordered the troops to cross it. Napoleon ordered them to form ranks on the other side and wait; but not only as Napoleon was giving this order, but even as the adjutant was leaving Borodino, the bridge had already been retaken and burned by the Russians, in that same skirmish which Pierre took part in at the very beginning of the battle.","From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his marshals kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment, and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict, but reported what they had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was riding the couple of versts to Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolocha was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait.

"— Спасибо тебе… дочь, дружок… за все, за все… прости… спасибо… прости… спасибо!.. — И слезы текли из его глаз. — Позовите Андрюшу, — вдруг сказал он, и что-то детски-робкое и недоверчивое выразилось в его лице при этом спросе. Он как будто сам знал, что спрос его не имеет смысла. Так, по крайней мере, показалось княжне Марье.","- Thank you ... daughter, friend ... for everything, for everything ... sorry ... thank you ... sorry ... thank you! .. - And tears flowed from his eyes. ""Call Andryusha,"" he suddenly said, and something childishly timid and distrustful was expressed in his face at this request. It was as if he himself knew that his demand was meaningless. So, at least, it seemed to Princess Mary.","“Thank you... daughter, dear friend ... for everything, everything ... forgive me ... thank you ... forgive me ... thank you! ...” And tears flowed from his eyes. “Call Andryusha,” he said suddenly, and something childishly timid and mistrustful showed in his face as he made this request. It was as if he knew himself that his request made no sense. At least it seemed so to Princess Marya.","‘Thank you … daughter dear! … for all, for all … forgive! … thank you! … forgive! … thank you! …’ and tears began to flow from his eyes. ‘Call Andryusha!’ he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke. He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it seemed to Princess Marya."
"— Нет, mon pere, [батюшка] — испуганно отвечала княжна. Она не могла читать письма, про получение которого она даже и не слышала.","“No, mon pere, [father],” the princess answered frightened. She couldn't read letters she hadn't even heard about receiving.","“No, mon père,” the princess replied fearfully. She could not have read a letter the reception of which she had not even heard about.","‘No, mon père,’ she replied in a frightened voice. She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived."
"— Ah, maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma position j'ai des devoirs, [Ах, маменька, не говорите глупостей. Вы ничего не понимаете.

Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma position j'ai des devoirs, [Ah, mother, don't talk nonsense. You don't understand anything.

"— Иди с богом своей дорогой. Я знаю, твоя дорога — это дорога чести. — Он помолчал. — Я жалел о тебе в Букареште: мне послать надо было. — И, переменив разговор, Кутузов начал говорить о турецкой войне и заключенном мире. — Да, немало упрекали меня, — сказал Кутузов, — и за войну и за мир… а все пришло вовремя. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre. [Все приходит вовремя для того, кто умеет ждать. ] A и там советчиков не меньше было, чем здесь… — продолжал он, возвращаясь к советчикам, которые, видимо, занимали его. — Ох, советчики, советчики! — сказал он. Если бы всех слушать, мы бы там, в Турции, и мира не заключили, да и войны бы не кончили. Всё поскорее, а скорое на долгое выходит. Если бы Каменский не умер, он бы пропал. Он с тридцатью тысячами штурмовал крепости. Взять крепость не трудно, трудно кампанию выиграть. А для этого не нужно штурмовать и атаковать, а нужно терпение и время. Каменский на Рущук солдат послал, а я их одних (терпение и время) посылал и взял больше крепостей, чем Каменский, и лошадиное мясо турок есть заставил. — Он покачал головой. — И французы тоже будут! Верь моему слову, — воодушевляясь, проговорил Кутузов, ударяя себя в грудь, — будут у меня лошадиное мясо есть! — И опять глаза его залоснились слезами.","- Go with God on your own path. I know your road is the road of honor. He paused. - I felt sorry for you in Bucarest: I should have sent. - And, changing the conversation, Kutuzov began to talk about the Turkish war and the peace concluded. - Yes, they reproached me a lot, - said Kutuzov, - both for the war and for peace ... but everything came on time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre. [Everything comes in time for the one who knows how to wait. ] And there were no less advisers there than here ... - he continued, returning to the advisers, who, apparently, occupied him. — Oh, advisers, advisers! - he said. If we had listened to everyone, we would not have concluded peace there, in Turkey, and we would not have ended the war. Everything is faster, and the soon comes out for a long time. If Kamensky had not died, he would have disappeared. He stormed the fortresses with thirty thousand. It is not difficult to take a fortress, it is difficult to win a campaign. And for this you do not need to storm and attack, but you need patience and time. Kamensky sent soldiers to Ruschuk, and I sent them alone (patience and time) and took more fortresses than Kamensky, and forced the horse meat of the Turks to eat. He shook his head. And the French will too! Believe my word, - Kutuzov said, inspiring, hitting his chest, - I will eat horse meat! And again his eyes filled with tears.","“Go your way with God. I know, your way is the way of honor.” He paused. “I was sorry you weren't in Bucharest: I needed someone to send.” And, changing the subject, Kutuzov began speaking about the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. “Yes, I've been reproached a good deal,” said Kutuzov, “both for the war and for the peace ... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre.[452] And there, too, there were no fewer advisers than here ...” he went on, returning to the advisers, who were clearly on his mind. “Ah, advisers, advisers!” he said. “If we'd listened to everybody there in Turkey, we wouldn't have made peace and brought the war to an end. Everything quickly, but quick turns out to be slow. If Kamensky hadn't died, he'd have been lost. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men.[231] It's not hard to take a fortress, it's hard to win a campaign. And for that there's no need to storm and attack, there's need for patience and time. Kamensky sent soldiers to Rushchuk, but I, with just those two (patience and time), took more fortresses than Kamensky and made the Turks eat horseflesh.” He shook his head. “And the French will, too! Take my word for it,” Kutuzov said, becoming animated and beating his chest, “they'll eat horseflesh for me!” And again his eyes glistened with tears.","‘Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honour!’ He paused. ‘I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.’ And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. ‘Yes, I have been much blamed,’ he said, ‘both for that war and the peace … but everything came at the right time. Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre.1 And there were as many advisers there as here …’ he went on, returning to the subject of ‘advisers’ which evidently occupied him. ‘ Ah, those advisers,’ said he. ‘If we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste less speed. Kamensky would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kamensky sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more fortresses than Kamensky and made the Turks eat horse-flesh!’ He swayed his head. ‘ And the French shall too, believe me,’ he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, ‘I’ll make them eat horse-flesh!’ And tears again dimmed his eyes."
"Правда, все в темном, мрачном свете представлялось князю Андрею — особенно после того, как оставили Смоленск (который, по его понятиям, можно и должно было защищать) 6-го августа, и после того, как отец, больной, должен был бежать в Москву и бросить на расхищение столь любимые, обстроенные и им населенные Лысые Горы; но, несмотря на то, благодаря полку князь Андрей мог думать о другом, совершенно независимом от общих вопросов предмете — о своем полку. 10-го августа колонна, в которой был его полк, поравнялась с Лысыми Горами. Князь Андрей два дня тому назад получил известие, что его отец, сын и сестра уехали в Москву. Хотя князю Андрею и нечего было делать в Лысых Горах, он, с свойственным ему желанием растравить свое горе, решил, что он должен заехать в Лысые Горы.","True, everything appeared to Prince Andrei in a dark, gloomy light - especially after they left Smolensk (which, according to his concepts, could and should have been defended) on August 6, and after his father, who was sick, had to flee to Moscow and throw away for plunder the so beloved, built and populated by him Bald Mountains; but, despite the fact, thanks to the regiment, Prince Andrei could think about another subject, completely independent of general questions - about his regiment. On August 10, the column, in which his regiment was, caught up with the Bald Mountains. Prince Andrei two days ago received the news that his father, son and sister had left for Moscow. Although Prince Andrei had nothing to do in the Bald Mountains, he, with his characteristic desire to exasperate his grief, decided that he should call in the Bald Mountains.","True, everything presented itself in a dark, gloomy light to Prince Andrei— especially after the abandoning of Smolensk (which, to his mind, could and should have been defended) on the sixth of August, and after his ailing father had to flee to Moscow and leave to be pillaged his beloved Bald Hills, which he had built and peopled; but despite that, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrei could think about a subject completely indepedent of general problems— about his regiment. On the tenth of August, the column of which his regiment formed part drew level with Bald Hills. Two days earlier, Prince Andrei had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow. Though Prince Andrei had nothing to do there, he, with his own peculiar wish to exacerbate his grief, decided that he had to stop and see Bald Hills.","In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrei, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the 6th of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.

"Князь Андрей нашел Барклая де Толли, к которому он был назначен, на берегу Дриссы. Так как не было ни одного большого села или местечка в окрестностях лагеря, то все огромное количество генералов и придворных, бывших при армии, располагалось в окружности десяти верст по лучшим домам деревень, по сю и по ту сторону реки. Барклай де Толли стоял в четырех верстах от государя. Он сухо и холодно принял Болконского и сказал своим немецким выговором, что он доложит о нем государю для определения ему назначения, а покамест просит его состоять при его штабе. Анатоля Курагина, которого князь Андрей надеялся найти в армии, не было здесь: он был в Петербурге, и это известие было приятно Болконскому. Интерес центра производящейся огромной войны занял князя Андрея, и он рад был на некоторое время освободиться от раздражения, которое производила в нем мысль о Курагине. В продолжение первых четырех дней, во время которых он не был никуда требуем, князь Андрей объездил весь укрепленный лагерь и с помощью своих знаний и разговоров с сведущими людьми старался составить себе о нем определенное понятие. Но вопрос о том, выгоден или невыгоден этот лагерь, остался нерешенным для князя Андрея. Он уже успел вывести из своего военного опыта то убеждение, что в военном деле ничего не значат самые глубокомысленно обдуманные планы (как он видел это в Аустерлицком походе), что все зависит от того, как отвечают на неожиданные и не могущие быть предвиденными действия неприятеля, что все зависит от того, как и кем ведется все дело. Для того чтобы уяснить себе этот последний вопрос, князь Андрей, пользуясь своим положением и знакомствами, старался вникнуть в характер управления армией, лиц и партий, участвовавших в оном, и вывел для себя следующее понятие о положении дел.","Prince Andrei found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he was assigned, on the banks of the Drissa. Since there was not a single large village or town in the vicinity of the camp, the whole huge number of generals and courtiers who were with the army were located in a circle of ten miles around the best houses of the villages, on this and on the other side of the river. Barclay de Tolly stood four versts from the sovereign. He received Bolkonsky dryly and coldly and said in his German reprimand that he would report on him to the sovereign to determine his appointment, and for the time being asked him to be at his headquarters. Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrei hoped to find in the army, was not here: he was in St. Petersburg, and Bolkonsky was pleased with this news. The interest of the center of the huge war that was being carried out occupied Prince Andrei, and he was glad for a while to be freed from the irritation that the thought of Kuragin produced in him. During the first four days, during which he did not demand anywhere, Prince Andrei traveled around the entire fortified camp and, with the help of his knowledge and conversations with knowledgeable people, tried to form a definite idea about him. But the question of whether this camp was beneficial or unprofitable remained unresolved for Prince Andrei. He had already managed to deduce from his military experience the conviction that in military affairs the most thoughtfully considered plans mean nothing (as he saw it in the Austerlitz campaign), that everything depends on how one responds to unexpected and unforeseen actions of the enemy, that it all depends on how and by whom the whole thing is conducted. In order to clarify this last question for himself, Prince Andrei, using his position and acquaintances, tried to understand the nature of the management of the army, the persons and parties participating in it, and deduced for himself the following concept of the state of affairs.","Prince Andrei found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single large village or settlement in the vicinity of the camp, all the huge number of generals and courtiers who were with the army settled within a radius of seven miles in the best houses of the hamlets on this and the other side of the river. Barclay de Tolly was staying some three miles from the sovereign. He received Bolkonsky drily and coldly, and said with his German accent[200] that he would report his arrival to the sovereign so as to determine an assignment for him, and meanwhile he invited him to stay with his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrei had hoped to find with the army, was not there: he was in Petersburg, and that news pleased Bolkonsky. Prince Andrei was taken up by the interest of being at the center of a huge, ongoing war, and he was glad to be free for a time of the vexation produced in him by the thought of Kuragin. In the course of the first four days, during which he was not called for anywhere, Prince Andrei rode around the entire fortified camp and, with the help of his knowledge and of conversations with well-informed people, tried to form some idea of it for himself. But the question of whether this camp was advantageous or not remained unresolved for Prince Andrei. He had already managed to draw from his military experience the conviction that in military matters the most profoundly devised plans meant nothing (as he had seen in the Austerlitz campaign), that everything depended on how one responded to the unexpected and unpredictable actions of the enemy, that everything depended on how and by whom the action was conducted. To clarify this last question for himself, Prince Andrei, using his position and acquaintances, tried to penetrate the character of the army's administration, of the persons and parties participating in it, and arrived at the following idea about the state of affairs.","Prince Andrei found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolkonsky stiffly and coldly, and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrei had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrei was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests of the centre that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin. During the first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrei rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance, and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy—that cannot be foreseen—are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself Prince Andrei, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following idea of the state of affairs."
"— Не брать пленных, — продолжал князь Андрей. — Это одно изменило бы всю войну и сделало бы ее менее жестокой. А то мы играли в войну — вот что скверно, мы великодушничаем и тому подобное. Это великодушничанье и чувствительность — вроде великодушия и чувствительности барыни, с которой делается дурнота, когда она видит убиваемого теленка; она так добра, что не может видеть кровь, но она с аппетитом кушает этого теленка под соусом. Нам толкуют о правах войны, о рыцарстве, о парламентерстве, щадить несчастных и так далее. Все вздор. Я видел в 1805 году рыцарство, парламентерство: нас надули, мы надули. Грабят чужие дома, пускают фальшивые ассигнации, да хуже всего — убивают моих детей, моего отца и говорят о правилах войны и великодушии к врагам. Не брать пленных, а убивать и идти на смерть! Кто дошел до этого так, как я, теми же страданиями…","“Do not take prisoners,” continued Prince Andrei. “That alone would change the whole war and make it less brutal. And then we played war - that's what's bad, we are magnanimous and the like. This generosity and sensitivity is like the generosity and sensitivity of a lady, with whom she becomes faint when she sees a calf being killed; she is so kind that she cannot see the blood, but she eats this calf with sauce with gusto. They talk to us about the rights of war, about chivalry, about parliamentary work, to spare the unfortunate, and so on. All nonsense. In 1805 I saw chivalry, parliamentarianism: they cheated us, we cheated. They rob other people's houses, let out fake banknotes, and worst of all, they kill my children, my father and talk about the rules of war and generosity towards enemies. Do not take prisoners, but kill and go to your death! Who has come to this the way I did, by the same suffering...","“Take no prisoners,” Prince Andrei went on. “That alone would change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is, we've been playing at war—that's the nasty thing, we act magnanimously and all that. It's like the magnanimity and sentimentality of the lady who swoons when she sees a calf slaughtered; she's so kind , she can't bear the sight of blood, but she eats the same calf in sauce with great appetite. We're told about the rules of war, about chivalry, about parleying, sparing the unfortunate, and so on. It's all nonsense. I saw chivalry and parleying in 1805: they cheated us, we cheated them. They loot other people's houses, spread false banknotes, and worst of all—kill my children and my father, and then talk about the rules of war and magnanimity towards the enemy. Take no prisoners, but kill and go to your death! Whoever has come to this, as I have, through the same sufferings...”","‘Not take prisoners,’ Prince Andrei continued. ‘That by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played at war— that’s what’s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kind-hearted that she can’t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate, and so on. It’s all rubbish. I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people’s houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the same sufferings …’"
"Вы слышали, верно, о героическом подвиге Раевского, обнявшего двух сыновей и сказавшего: «Погибну с ними, но не поколеблемся!

The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our lint bandages, only you my friend are missing … And so on."

"— Ах, этот ваш граф, — с злобой заговорила княжна, — это лицемер, злодей, который сам настроил народ бунтовать.

Didn’t he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone “whoever it might be, should be dragged to the lock-up by his hair”? (How silly!) “And honour and glory to whoever captures him,” he says.

"Княжна Марья умоляла брата подождать еще день, говорила о том, что она знает, как будет несчастлив отец, ежели Андрей уедет, не помирившись с ним; но князь Андрей отвечал, что он, вероятно, скоро приедет опять из армии, что непременно напишет отцу и что теперь чем дольше оставаться, тем больше растравится этот раздор.","Princess Mary begged her brother to wait another day, saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrei left without reconciling with him; but Prince Andrei answered that he would probably soon come again from the army, that he would certainly write to his father, and that now the longer he stayed, the more this dissension would be aggravated.","Princess Marya begged her brother to wait one more day; she said she knew now unhappy their father would be if Andrei left without making peace with him; but Prince Andrei replied that he would probably come back soon from the army, that he would be sure to write to their father, and that the longer he stayed now, the more aggravated the discord would be.","Princess Marya begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrei left without being reconciled to him, but Prince Andrei replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army, and would certainly write to his father, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their difference would become."

"Не один Наполеон испытывал то похожее на сновиденье чувство, что страшный размах руки падает бессильно, но все генералы, все участвовавшие и не участвовавшие солдаты французской армии, после всех опытов прежних сражений (где после вдесятеро меньших усилий неприятель бежал), испытывали одинаковое чувство ужаса перед тем врагом, который, потеряв половину войска, стоял так же грозно в конце, как и в начале сражения. Нравственная сила французской, атакующей армии была истощена. Не та победа, которая определяется подхваченными кусками материи на палках, называемых знаменами, и тем пространством, на котором стояли и стоят войска, — а победа нравственная, та, которая убеждает противника в нравственном превосходстве своего врага и в своем бессилии, была одержана русскими под Бородиным. Французское нашествие, как разъяренный зверь, получивший в своем разбеге смертельную рану, чувствовало свою погибель; но оно не могло остановиться, так же как и не могло не отклониться вдвое слабейшее русское войско. После данного толчка французское войско еще могло докатиться до Москвы; но там, без новых усилий со стороны русского войска, оно должно было погибнуть, истекая кровью от смертельной, нанесенной при Бородине, раны. Прямым следствием Бородинского сражения было беспричинное бегство Наполеона из Москвы, возвращение по старой Смоленской дороге, погибель пятисоттысячного нашествия и погибель наполеоновской Франции, на которую в первый раз под Бородиным была наложена рука сильнейшего духом противника.","Not only Napoleon experienced that dream-like feeling that the terrible swing of the arm falls powerlessly, but all the generals, all the soldiers of the French army participating and not participating, after all the experiences of previous battles (where, after ten times less effort, the enemy fled), experienced the same feeling of horror before that enemy, who, having lost half the army, stood just as formidably at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral strength of the French attacking army was exhausted. Not that victory, which is determined by picked up pieces of matter on sticks, called banners, and by the space on which the troops stood and are standing, but a moral victory, one that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his enemy and of his impotence, was won by the Russians under Borodin. The French invasion, like an angry beast that received a mortal wound in its run, felt its death; but it could not stop, just as the weakest Russian army could not but deviate. After this push, the French army could still reach Moscow; but there, without new efforts on the part of the Russian army, it was to die, bleeding from a fatal wound inflicted at Borodino. A direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was Napoleon's unreasonable flight from Moscow, the return along the old Smolensk road, the death of the five hundred thousandth invasion and the death of Napoleonic France, which for the first time near Borodino was laid down by the hand of the strongest enemy in spirit.","It was not Napoleon alone who experienced that dreamlike feeling that the terrible swing of the arm fell strengthless, but all the generals, all the participating and nonparticipating soldiers of the French army, after all their experience of previous battles (where the enemy had fled after ten times less effort), experienced the same feeling of terror before an enemy who, having lost half his army, stood as formidably at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral strength of the attacking French army was exhausted. It was not the sort of victory that is determined by captured pieces of cloth on sticks, known as standards, and by the amount of ground the troops stood and stand on, but a moral victory, the sort that convinces the adversary of the moral superiority of his enemy and of his own impotence, that was gained by the Russians at Borodino. The French invasion, like an enraged beast mortally wounded as it charges, sensed its destruction; but it could not stop, just as the twice weaker Russian army could not help moving aside. After the shove it had been given, the French army could still roll on as far as Moscow; but there, with no new efforts on the part of the Russian army, it was to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was Napoleon's causeless flight from Moscow, the return down the old Smolensk road, the destruction of an invading army of five hundred thousand men, and the destruction of Napoleonic France, upon which had been laid for the first time, at Borodino, the hand of an adversary stronger in spirit.","It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and soldiers of his army, whether they had taken part in the battle or not, after all their experience of previous battles—when after one-tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled—experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence, was gained by the Russians at Borodino. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker by one-half, could help swerving. By the impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was Napoleon’s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old Smolensk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at Borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid."

"Но как только вышел дворецкий, Пьер взял шляпу, лежавшую на столе, и вышел в заднюю дверь из кабинета. В коридоре никого не было. Пьер прошел во всю длину коридора до лестницы и, морщась и растирая лоб обеими руками, спустился до первой площадки. Швейцар стоял у парадной двери. С площадки, на которую спустился Пьер, другая лестница вела к заднему ходу. Пьер пошел по ней и вышел во двор. Никто не видал его.

"В последнее время, после приезда государя из армии, произошло некоторое волнение в этих противоположных кружках-салонах и произведены были некоторые демонстрации друг против друга, но направление кружков осталось то же. В кружок Анны Павловны принимались из французов только закоренелые легитимисты, и здесь выражалась патриотическая мысль о том, что не надо ездить во французский театр и что содержание труппы стоит столько же, сколько содержание целого корпуса. За военными событиями следилось жадно, и распускались самые выгодные для нашей армии слухи. В кружке Элен, румянцевском, французском, опровергались слухи о жестокости врага и войны и обсуживались все попытки Наполеона к примирению. В этом кружке упрекали тех, кто присоветывал слишком поспешные распоряжения о том, чтобы приготавливаться к отъезду в Казань придворным и женским учебным заведениям, находящимся под покровительством императрицы-матери. Вообще все дело войны представлялось в салоне Элен пустыми демонстрациями, которые весьма скоро кончатся миром, и царствовало мнение Билибина, бывшего теперь в Петербурге и домашним у Элен (всякий умный человек должен был быть у нее), что не порох, а те, кто его выдумали, решат дело. В этом кружке иронически и весьма умно, хотя весьма осторожно, осмеивали московский восторг, известие о котором прибыло вместе с государем в Петербург.","Recently, after the arrival of the sovereign from the army, there was some excitement in these opposing salon circles and some demonstrations were made against each other, but the direction of the circles remained the same. Only inveterate legitimists from the French were accepted into Anna Pavlovna's circle, and here the patriotic idea was expressed that it was not necessary to go to the French theater and that the maintenance of the troupe cost as much as the maintenance of the whole building. The military events were eagerly followed, and the most beneficial rumors for our army were spread. In Helen's circle, Rumyantsev, French, rumors about the cruelty of the enemy and the war were refuted and all Napoleon's attempts at reconciliation were discussed. In this circle, those who advised too hasty orders to prepare for departure to Kazan court and women's educational institutions, under the patronage of the Empress Mother, were reproached. In general, the whole matter of the war was presented in Helen’s salon as empty demonstrations that would very soon end in peace, and the opinion of Bilibin, who was now in St. think they'll solve the problem. In this circle, ironically and very cleverly, although very carefully, they ridiculed the Moscow delight, the news of which arrived with the sovereign in St. Petersburg.","Recently, after the sovereign's arrival from the army, some sort of flurry had gone on in these opposing salon circles, and there had been some sort of demonstrations against each other, but the tendencies of the circles remained the same.

Military events were eagerly followed, and the most advantageous rumors were spread about our army. The pro-French circle of Hélène and Rumyantsev refuted the rumors about the cruelty of the enemy and the war, and discussed all of Napoleon's attempts at reconciliation.

In general, the whole matter of the war was presented in Hélène's salon as empty demonstrations, which would quite soon end in peace, and there reigned the opinion of Bilibin, now in Petersburg and a familiar at Hélène's (every intelligent person had to be received in her salon), that the matter would be resolved not by gunpowder, but by those who invented it.[221] This circle ironically and quite intelligently, though also quite cautiously, laughed at the Moscow raptures, news of which had come to Petersburg with the sovereign.","Of late, since the Emperor’s return from the army, there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon-circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In Anna Pavlovna’s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the French theatre, and that to maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French circle of Hélène and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon’s attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazan of the Court and the girls’ educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In Hélène’s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bilibin—who now in Petersburg was quite at home in Hélène’s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit—that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm—news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor’s return—was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution."

"— Ежели бы не было великодушничанья на войне, то мы шли бы только тогда, когда стоит того идти на верную смерть, как теперь. Тогда не было бы войны за то, что Павел Иваныч обидел Михаила Иваныча. А ежели война как теперь, так война. И тогда интенсивность войск была бы не та, как теперь. Тогда бы все эти вестфальцы и гессенцы, которых ведет Наполеон, не пошли бы за ним в Россию, и мы бы не ходили драться в Австрию и в Пруссию, сами не зная зачем. Война не любезность, а самое гадкое дело в жизни, и надо понимать это и не играть в войну. Надо принимать строго и серьезно эту страшную необходимость. Всё в этом: откинуть ложь, и война так война, а не игрушка. А то война — это любимая забава праздных и легкомысленных людей… Военное сословие самое почетное. А что такое война, что нужно для успеха в военном деле, какие нравы военного общества? Цель войны — убийство, орудия войны — шпионство, измена и поощрение ее, разорение жителей, ограбление их или воровство для продовольствия армии; обман и ложь, называемые военными хитростями; нравы военного сословия — отсутствие свободы, то есть дисциплина, праздность, невежество, жестокость, разврат, пьянство. И несмотря на то — это высшее сословие, почитаемое всеми. Все цари, кроме китайского, носят военный мундир, и тому, кто больше убил народа, дают большую награду… Сойдутся, как завтра, на убийство друг друга, перебьют, перекалечат десятки тысяч людей, а потом будут служить благодарственные молебны за то, что побили много людей (которых число еще прибавляют), и провозглашают победу, полагая, что чем больше побито людей, тем больше заслуга. Как бог оттуда смотрит и слушает их! — тонким, пискливым голосом прокричал князь Андрей. — Ах, душа моя, последнее время мне стало тяжело жить. Я вижу, что стал понимать слишком много. А не годится человеку вкушать от древа познания добра и зла… Ну, да не надолго! — прибавил он. — Однако ты спишь, да и мне пора, поезжай в Горки, — вдруг сказал князь Андрей.","- If there was no generosity in the war, then we would go only when it is worth it to go to certain death, as now. Then there would be no war because Pavel Ivanovich offended Mikhail Ivanovich. And if the war is like now, then the war. And then the intensity of the troops would not be the same as now. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians, who are led by Napoleon, would not have followed him to Russia, and we would not have gone to fight in Austria and Prussia, without knowing why. War is not a courtesy, but the most vile thing in life, and one must understand this and not play war. This terrible necessity must be taken strictly and seriously. It's all about this: put aside lies, and war is war, not a toy. Otherwise, war is the favorite pastime of idle and frivolous people ... The military class is the most honorable. And what is war, what is needed for success in military affairs, what are the morals of a military society? The purpose of the war is murder, the weapons of war are espionage, treason and encouragement, the ruin of the inhabitants, robbing them or stealing for the food of the army; deceit and lies, called stratagems; the mores of the military class - lack of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, depravity, drunkenness. And despite that - this is the highest class, revered by all. All the kings, except for the Chinese, wear a military uniform, and the one who killed the most people is given a big reward ... They will converge, like tomorrow, to kill each other, they will kill, maim tens of thousands of people, and then they will serve thanksgiving prayers for having beaten many people (of which the number is still being added), and proclaim victory, believing that the more people beaten, the greater the merit. How God watches and listens to them from there! Prince Andrei shouted in a thin, squeaky voice. “Ah, my soul, lately it has become hard for me to live. I see that I began to understand too much. And it’s not good for a person to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ... Well, not for long! he added. “However, you are sleeping, and it’s time for me too, go to Gorki,” Prince Andrei suddenly said.","“If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we'd go to it only when it was worth going to certain death, as now.

"В то время как он говорил это, в глазах его и выражении всего лица было больше чем сухость — была враждебность, которую тотчас же заметил Пьер.

"В Кремле раздавался благовест к вечерне, и этот звон смущал французов. Они предполагали, что это был призыв к оружию. Несколько человек пехотных солдат побежали к Кутафьевским воротам.

Для чего вывозились кипы ненужных бумаг из присутственных мест и шар Леппиха и другие предметы? — Для того, чтобы оставить город пустым, отвечает объяснение графа Растопчина.

"«Так это должно быть! — думал князь Андрей, выезжая из аллеи лысогорского дома. — Она, жалкое невинное существо, остается на съедение выжившему из ума старику. Старик чувствует, что виноват, но не может изменить себя. Мальчик мой растет и радуется жизни, в которой он будет таким же, как и все, обманутым или обманывающим. Я еду в армию, зачем? — сам не знаю, и желаю встретить того человека, которого презираю, для того чтобы дать ему случай убить меня и посмеяться надо мной! И прежде были все те же условия жизни, но прежде они все вязались между собой, а теперь все рассыпалось. Одни бессмысленные явления, без всякой связи, одно за другим представлялись князю Андрею.","“So it should be! - thought Prince Andrei, leaving the alley of the Lysogorsk house. - She, a pitiful innocent creature, remains to be eaten by an old man who has gone out of his mind. The old man feels that he is guilty, but he cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and enjoying a life in which he will be the same as everyone else, deceived or deceiving. I'm going to the army, why? — I don’t know myself, and I want to meet the man whom I despise in order to give him the opportunity to kill me and laugh at me! And before there were all the same conditions of life, but before they all knitted together, and now everything crumbled. Some meaningless phenomena, without any connection, one after another presented themselves to Prince Andrei.","“So it must be!” thought Prince Andrei as he was driving out of the avenue of the house at Bald Hills. “She, a pathetic, innocent being, stays to be devoured by a senile old man. The old man feels he's to blame, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices at life, in which he will be the same as everybody else, the deceived or the deceiver. I'm going to the army—why? I don't know myself, and I wish to meet a man whom I despise, in order to give him an occasion to kill me and laugh at me!” Before, too, there had been the same conditions of life, but before they had all cohered, while now everything had fallen apart. Nothing but meaningless phenomena, without any connection with each other, presented themselves to Prince Andrei one after the other.","‘Then it must be so!’ thought Prince Andrei as he drove out of the avenue from the house at Bald Hills. ‘She, poor innocent creature, is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don’t know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!’ These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to Prince Andrei’s mind."

"— Фю… фю… фю, — просвистал он и опять оглянулся на князя Андрея. Впечатление лица князя Андрея только после нескольких секунд (как это часто бывает у стариков) связалось с воспоминанием о его личности.","“Fu… fu… fu,” he whistled and looked back at Prince Andrei. The impression of Prince Andrei's face only after a few seconds (as is often the case with old people) was associated with the memory of his personality.","“Phew... phew... phew,” he whistled and again glanced around at Prince Andrei. Only after several seconds did the impression of Prince Andrei's face (as often happens with old men) connect with the remembrance of his person.","‘Whew … whew … whew!’ he whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrei.

"Самое первое далекое детство вспомнилось князю Андрею, когда фельдшер торопившимися засученными руками расстегивал ему пуговицы и снимал с него платье. Доктор низко нагнулся над раной, ощупал ее и тяжело вздохнул. Потом он сделал знак кому-то. И мучительная боль внутри живота заставила князя Андрея потерять сознание. Когда он очнулся, разбитые кости бедра были вынуты, клоки мяса отрезаны, и рана перевязана. Ему прыскали в лицо водою. Как только князь Андрей открыл глаза, доктор нагнулся над ним, молча поцеловал его в губы и поспешно отошел.","The very first distant childhood was remembered by Prince Andrei, when the paramedic, with his hastily rolled up hands, unbuttoned his buttons and took off his dress. The doctor bent low over the wound, felt it, and sighed heavily. Then he made a sign to someone. And the excruciating pain inside the abdomen made Prince Andrei lose consciousness. When he woke up, the broken bones of the thigh were taken out, shreds of meat were cut off, and the wound was bandaged. They splashed water in his face. As soon as Prince Andrei opened his eyes, the doctor bent over him, silently kissed him on the lips, and hurried away.","His very first, distant childhood came to Prince Andrei's mind as the assistant, his sleeves rolled up, unbuttoned and removed his clothes with hurrying hands.

When he came to, the shattered hip bones had been removed, the shreds of flesh had been cut off, and the wound had been dressed. Someone sprayed water in his face. As soon as Prince Andrei opened his eyes, the doctor bent over him, silently kissed him on the lips, and hurried away.","His very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince Andrei’s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him.

"Давно не слышанный этот звук еще радостнее и возбудительное подействовал на Ростова, чем прежние звуки стрельбы.

"Известен так называемый софизм древних, состоящий в том, что Ахиллес никогда не догонит впереди идущую черепаху, несмотря на то, что Ахиллес идет в десять раз скорее черепахи: как только Ахиллес пройдет пространство, отделяющее его от черепахи, черепаха пройдет впереди его одну десятую этого пространства; Ахиллес пройдет эту десятую, черепаха пройдет одну сотую и т. д. до бесконечности. Задача эта представлялась древним неразрешимою. Бессмысленность решения (что Ахиллес никогда не догонит черепаху) вытекала из того только, что произвольно были допущены прерывные единицы движения, тогда как движение и Ахиллеса и черепахи совершалось непрерывно.","The so-called sophism of the ancients is known, which consists in the fact that Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise in front, despite the fact that Achilles walks ten times faster than the tortoise: as soon as Achilles passes the space separating him from the tortoise, the tortoise will pass ahead of him one tenth of this space; Achilles will go through this tenth, the tortoise will go through one hundredth, and so on ad infinitum. This problem seemed unsolvable to the ancients. The senselessness of the decision (that Achilles will never catch up with the tortoise) stemmed from the fact that discontinuous units of movement were arbitrarily allowed, while the movement of both Achilles and the tortoise was continuous.","A well-known so-called sophism of the ancients posits that Achilles can never overtake a tortoise that is walking ahead of him, even though Achilles walks ten times faster than the tortoise: while Achilles covers the distance that separates him from the tortoise, the tortoise will get ahead of him by one tenth of that distance; Achilles covers that one tenth, the tortoise gets ahead by one hundredth, and so on to infinity.

Above Pierre's head, under the dark underside of the plank canopy, doves fluttered from the movement he made while rising. A peaceful, joyful for Pierre at that moment, strong smell of an inn, the smell of hay, manure and tar was poured throughout the courtyard. Between the two black awnings one could see a clear starry sky.","Pierre had barely laid his head on the pillow when he felt himself falling asleep; but suddenly, with an almost lifelike clarity, he heard the boom-boom-boom of gunfire, heard groans, cries, the smack of projectiles, smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of terror and the fear of death seized him. Frightened, he opened his eyes and raised his head from under the greatcoat. All was quiet in the courtyard. Only some orderly came through the gate, talking with the yard porter and splashing through the mud. Some pigeons above Pierre's head, in the dark under the wooden eaves, were roused by the movement he made as he raised himself. The whole courtyard was filled with the peaceful, strong smell of an inn, which gladdened Pierre at that moment, the smell of hay, dung, and tar. Between the two black sheds the clear, starry night could be seen.","SCARCELY had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans and cries, and smelt blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone’s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper.

"Княжна Марья выбежала на крыльцо, на цветочную дорожку и в аллею. Навстречу ей подвигалась большая толпа ополченцев и дворовых, и в середине этой толпы несколько людей под руки волокли маленького старичка в мундире и орденах. Княжна Марья подбежала к нему и, в игре мелкими кругами падавшего света, сквозь тень липовой аллеи, не могла дать себе отчета в том, какая перемена произошла в его лице. Одно, что она увидала, было то, что прежнее строгое и решительное выражение его лица заменилось выражением робости и покорности. Увидав дочь, он зашевелил бессильными губами и захрипел. Нельзя было понять, чего он хотел. Его подняли на руки, отнесли в кабинет и положили на тот диван, которого он так боялся последнее время.","Princess Mary ran out onto the porch, onto the flower path and into the alley.

"Несмотря на известие о взятии флешей, Наполеон видел, что это было не то, совсем не то, что было во всех его прежних сражениях. Он видел, что то же чувство, которое испытывал он, испытывали и все его окружающие люди, опытные в деле сражений. Все лица были печальны, все глаза избегали друг друга. Только один Боссе не мог понимать значения того, что совершалось. Наполеон же после своего долгого опыта войны знал хорошо, что значило в продолжение восьми часов, после всех употрсбленных усилий, невыигранное атакующим сражение. Он знал, что это было почти проигранное сражение и что малейшая случайность могла теперь — на той натянутой точке колебания, на которой стояло сражение, — погубить его и его войска.","Despite the news of the capture of the flushes, Napoleon saw that it was not the same, not at all what had been in all his previous battles. He saw that the same feeling that he experienced was experienced by all the people around him, experienced in battles. All faces were sad, all eyes avoided each other. Only Bosse could not understand the significance of what was happening. Napoleon, after his long experience of the war, knew well what it meant in the course of eight hours, after all the efforts expended, a battle not won by the attacker. He knew that it was almost a lost battle and that the slightest chance could now - on that tense point of hesitation on which the battle stood - destroy him and his troops.","Despite the news of the taking of the flèches, Napoleon saw that this was different, quite different, from all his previous battles. He saw that the same feeling he experienced was being experienced by all the people around him, battle-seasoned as they were. All their faces were sad, they all avoided each other's eyes. Beausset alone could not understand the meaning of what was happening. But Napoleon, after his long experience of war, knew very well what it meant when, in the course of eight hours, after making every effort, the attacking army had not won the battle. He knew that this was almost a lost battle, and that the smallest chance—at that precarious point of indecision the battle had come to—could destroy him and his troops.","Despite news of the capture of the flèches, Napoleon saw that this was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war.

But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now—with the fight balanced on such a strained centre—destroy him and his army."
"Пьер все так же ездил в общество, так же много пил и вел ту же праздную и рассеянную жизнь, потому что, кроме тех часов, которые он проводил у Ростовых, надо было проводить и остальное время, и привычки и знакомства, сделанные им в Москве, непреодолимо влекли его к той жизни, которая захватила его. Но в последнее время, когда с театра войны приходили все более и более тревожные слухи и когда здоровье Наташи стало поправляться и она перестала возбуждать в нем прежнее чувство бережливой жалости, им стало овладевать более и более непонятное для него беспокойство. Он чувствовал, что то положение, в котором он находился, не могло продолжаться долго, что наступает катастрофа, долженствующая изменить всю его жизнь, и с нетерпением отыскивал во всем признаки этой приближающейся катастрофы. Пьеру было открыто одним из братьев-масонов следующее, выведенное из Апокалипсиса Иоанна Богослова, пророчество относительно Наполеона.","Pierre still went to society, drank just as much and led the same idle and absent-minded life, because, in addition to those hours that he spent with the Rostovs, he had to spend the rest of the time, and the habits and acquaintances he made in Moscow , irresistibly attracted him to the life that captured him. But lately, when more and more disturbing rumors came from the theater of war, and when Natasha's health began to improve and she ceased to arouse in him the former feeling of thrifty pity, he began to be seized by more and more incomprehensible restlessness.

"Тот тон великодушия, в котором намерен был действовать в Москве Наполеон, увлек его самого. Он в воображении своем назначал дни reunion dans le palais des Czars [собраний во дворце царей. ], где должны были сходиться русские вельможи с вельможами французского императора. Он назначал мысленно губернатора, такого, который бы сумел привлечь к себе население. Узнав о том, что в Москве много богоугодных заведений, он в воображении своем решал, что все эти заведения будут осыпаны его милостями. Он думал, что как в Африке надо было сидеть в бурнусе в мечети, так в Москве надо было быть милостивым, как цари. И, чтобы окончательно тронуть сердца русских, он, как и каждый француз, не могущий себе вообразить ничего чувствительного без упоминания о ma chere, ma tendre, ma pauvre mere,[моей милой, нежной, бедной матери, ] он решил, что на всех этих заведениях он велит написать большими буквами: Etablissement dedie a ma chere Mere. Нет, просто: Maison de ma Mere, [Учреждение, посвященное моей милой матери… Дом моей матери. ] — решил он сам с собою. «Но неужели я в Москве? Да, вот она передо мной. Но что же так долго не является депутация города?» — думал он.","The tone of generosity in which Napoleon intended to act in Moscow captivated him. In his imagination he appointed the days of the reunion dans le palais des Czars [meetings in the palace of the kings. ], where Russian nobles were supposed to converge with the nobles of the French emperor.

Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in Moscow, he decided in his imagination that all these institutions would be showered with his favors. He thought that just as in Africa one had to sit in a burnous in a mosque, so in Moscow one had to be merciful, like tsars. And, in order to finally touch the hearts of Russians, he, like every Frenchman, who cannot imagine anything sensitive without mentioning ma chere, ma tendre, ma pauvre mere, [my dear, tender, poor mother,] he decided that in all in these establishments, he orders to write in capital letters: Etablissement dedie a ma chere Mere. No, just: Maison de ma Mere, [Institution dedicated to my sweet mother... My mother's house. ] he decided to himself. “But am I really in Moscow? Yes, there she is in front of me.

A huge Drissa camp is being set up according to Pfuel's plan and it is not supposed to retreat further. The sovereign reproaches the commander-in-chief for every step of retreat.

"В это воскресенье Ростовы, по обыкновению, поехали к обедне в домовую церковь Разумовских. Был жаркий июльский день. Уже в десять часов, когда Ростовы выходили из кареты перед церковью, в жарком воздухе, в криках разносчиков, в ярких и светлых летних платьях толпы, в запыленных листьях дерев бульвара, в звуках музыки и белых панталонах прошедшего на развод батальона, в громе мостовой и ярком блеске жаркого солнца было то летнее томление, довольство и недовольство настоящим, которое особенно резко чувствуется в ясный жаркий день в городе. В церкви Разумовских была вся знать московская, все знакомые Ростовых (в этот год, как бы ожидая чего-то, очень много богатых семей, обыкновенно разъезжающихся по деревням, остались в городе). Проходя позади ливрейного лакея, раздвигавшего толпу подле матери, Наташа услыхала голос молодого человека, слишком громким шепотом говорившего о ней:","On this Sunday, the Rostovs, as usual, went to mass at the house church of the Razumovskys. It was a hot July day. Already at ten o'clock, when the Rostovs got out of the carriage in front of the church, in the hot air, in the cries of peddlers, in the bright and light summer dresses of the crowd, in the dusty leaves of the trees of the boulevard, in the sounds of music and white pantaloons of the battalion that passed for divorce, in the thunder of the pavement and In the bright glare of the hot sun there was that summer languor, contentment and dissatisfaction with the present, which is especially sharply felt on a clear hot day in the city. In the church of the Razumovskys there was all the nobility of Moscow, all the acquaintances of the Rostovs (this year, as if expecting something, a lot of wealthy families, usually moving around the villages, remained in the city). Passing behind the livery footman, who was parting the crowd beside her mother, Natasha heard the voice of a young man speaking in a too loud whisper about her:","That Sunday the Rostovs, as usual, went to the liturgy at the Razumovskys' house chapel. It was a hot July day.

All the Moscow nobility, all the Rostovs' acquaintances, were in the Razumovskys' chapel (that year, as if expecting something, many wealthy families, who usually went off to their country estates, stayed in town). Walking behind the liveried footman who made way through the crowd before her mother, Natasha heard a young man's voice saying of her in much too loud a whisper:","That Sunday the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskys’ private chapel as usual.

All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostovs’ acquaintances, were at the Razumovskys’ chapel, for as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer.

"Он поглядел на часы. Было еще только четыре часа. Спать не хотелось, пунш был допит, и делать все-таки было нечего. Он встал, прошелся взад и вперед, надел теплый сюртук и шляпу и вышел из палатки. Ночь была темная и сырая; чуть слышная сырость падала сверху. Костры не ярко горели вблизи, во французской гвардии, и далеко сквозь дым блестели по русской линии.

"После отъезда государя из Москвы московская жизнь потекла прежним, обычным порядком, и течение этой жизни было так обычно, что трудно было вспомнить о бывших днях патриотического восторга и увлечения, и трудно было верить, что действительно Россия в опасности и что члены Английского клуба суть вместе с тем и сыны отечества, готовые для него на всякую жертву. Одно, что напоминало о бывшем во время пребывания государя в Москве общем восторженно-патриотическом настроении, было требование пожертвований людьми и деньгами, которые, как скоро они были сделаны, облеклись в законную, официальную форму и казались неизбежны.","After the departure of the sovereign from Moscow, Moscow life went on as usual, and the course of this life was so usual that it was difficult to recall the former days of patriotic enthusiasm and enthusiasm, and it was difficult to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were together. with this, the sons of the fatherland, ready for him for any sacrifice.

"— L'amour platonique, les nuages… [Платоническая любовь, облака…] — пробормотал он. Выпитое ли вино, или потребность откровенности, или мысль, что этот человек не знает и не узнает никого из действующих лиц его истории, или все вместе развязало язык Пьеру. И он шамкающим ртом и маслеными глазами, глядя куда-то вдаль, рассказал всю свою историю: и свою женитьбу, и историю любви Наташи к его лучшему другу, и ее измену, и все свои несложные отношения к ней. Вызываемый вопросами Рамбаля, он рассказал и то, что скрывал сначала, — свое положение в свете и даже открыл ему свое имя.","“L'amour platonique, les nuages… [Platonic love, clouds…],” he muttered. Whether the wine drunk, or the need for frankness, or the thought that this man does not know and will not recognize any of the characters in his story, or all together loosened Pierre's tongue. And with a mumbling mouth and oily eyes, looking somewhere into the distance, he told his whole story: both his marriage, and the story of Natasha's love for his best friend, and her betrayal, and all his simple relationships with her. Called on by Rambal's questions, he also told what he had hidden at first - his position in the world and even revealed his name to him.","“L'amour platonique, les nuages...”[613] he murmured. The wine he had drunk, or the need for openness, or the thought that this man did not and never would know any of the persons active in his story, or all of it together, loosened Pierre's tongue. And with a maundering mouth, his unctuous eyes looking somewhere into the distance, he told his whole story: his marriage, the story of Natasha's love for his best friend, and her betrayal, and all his own uncomplicated relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe's questions, he even told him what he had concealed at first—his social position— and even revealed his name to him.","‘L’amour platonique, les nuages …’2 he muttered. Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together, something loosened Pierre’s tongue. Speaking thickly, and with a far-away look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his marriage, Natasha’s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe’s questions he also told what he had at first concealed—his own position and even his name."

"«Так вот что такое государь! — думал Петя. — Нет, нельзя мне самому подать ему прошение, это слишком смело! Несмотря на то, он все так же отчаянно пробивался вперед, и из-за спин передних ему мелькнуло пустое пространство с устланным красным сукном ходом; но в это время толпа заколебалась назад (спереди полицейские отталкивали надвинувшихся слишком близко к шествию; государь проходил из дворца в Успенский собор), и Петя неожиданно получил в бок такой удар по ребрам и так был придавлен, что вдруг в глазах его все помутилось и он потерял сознание. Когда он пришел в себя, какое-то духовное лицо, с пучком седевших волос назади, в потертой синей рясе, вероятно, дьячок, одной рукой держал его под мышку, другой охранял от напиравшей толпы.","""So that's what a sovereign is! thought Petya. “No, I can’t apply to him myself, it’s too bold! Despite the fact that he was still desperately making his way forward, and from behind the backs of those in front he flashed an empty space with a passage lined with red cloth; but at that moment the crowd staggered back (from the front the policemen were pushing those who had advanced too close to the procession; the sovereign was passing from the palace to the Assumption Cathedral), and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow to the ribs in the side and was so crushed that suddenly everything became dim in his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to his senses, some clergyman, with a tuft of graying hair behind him, in a shabby blue cassock, probably a deacon, held him under his arm with one hand, and guarded him from the oncoming crowd with the other.","“So this is what the sovereign is!” Petya thought. “No, it's impossible for me to hand him a petition myself, it's too bold!” In spite of which, he made his way forward just as desperately, and saw, flashing between the backs of those ahead of him, an empty space and a passage laid with red cloth; but just then the crowd heaved backwards (the policemen ahead shoved back those who got too close to the procession; the sovereign passed from the palace to the cathedral of the Dormition), and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow in the ribs from the side, and was so squeezed, that everything suddenly went dim in his eyes, and he lost consciousness. When he came to, some clergyman with a clump of graying hair tied behind, in a shabby blue cassock, probably a beadle, was holding him under the arm with one hand and protecting him from the pressing crowd with the other.","‘So this is what the Emperor is!’ thought Petya. ‘ No, I can’t petition him myself—that would be too bold.’ But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back—the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption—and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs, and was squeezed so hard, that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of grey hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock—probably a church clerk and chanter—was holding him under the arm with one hand, while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other."
"— И что же, разве наши ополченцы составили пользу для государства? Никакой! только разорили наши хозяйства. Лучше еще набор… а то вернется к вам ни солдат, ни мужик, и только один разврат.

"Здесь, на крайнем левом фланге, Бенигсен много и горячо говорил и сделал, как казалось Пьеру, важное в военном отношении распоряжение. Впереди расположения войск Тучкова находилось возвышение. Это возвышение не было занято войсками. Бенигсен громко критиковал эту ошибку, говоря, что было безумно оставить незанятою командующую местностью высоту и поставить войска под нею. Некоторые генералы выражали то же мнение. Один в особенности с воинской горячностью говорил о том, что их поставили тут на убой. Бенигсен приказал своим именем передвинуть войска на высоту.","Here, on the extreme left flank, Bennigsen spoke a lot and ardently and made, as it seemed to Pierre, an important order from a military point of view.

One in particular spoke with military vehemence that they were put here to be slaughtered. Bennigsen ordered in his name to move the troops to the heights.","Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen spoke a great deal and vehemently, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave instructions that were important in a military respect.

Bennigsen loudly criticized this error, saying that it was mad to leave a height that commanded the terrain unoccupied and place troops at the foot of it. Some generals expressed the same opinion.

"Как ни странно было княжне сознавать в себе это чувство, но оно было в ней. И что было еще ужаснее для княжны Марьи, это было то, что со времени болезни ее отца (даже едва ли не раньше, не тогда ли уж, когда она, ожидая чего-то, осталась с ним) в ней проснулись все заснувшие в ней, забытые личные желания и надежды. То, что годами не приходило ей в голову — мысли о свободной жизни без вечного страха отца, даже мысли о возможности любви и семейного счастия, как искушения дьявола, беспрестанно носились в ее воображении. Как ни отстраняла она от себя, беспрестанно ей приходили в голову вопросы о том, как она теперь, после того, устроит свою жизнь. Это были искушения дьявола, и княжна Марья знала это. Она знала, что единственное орудие против него была молитва, и она пыталась молиться. Она становилась в положение молитвы, смотрела на образа, читала слова молитвы, но не могла молиться. Она чувствовала, что теперь ее охватил другой мир — житейской, трудной и свободной деятельности, совершенно противоположный тому нравственному миру, в который она была заключена прежде и в котором лучшее утешение была молитва. Она не могла молиться и не могла плакать, и житейская забота охватила ее.","Strange as it was, the princess was aware of this feeling in herself, but it was in her. And what was even more terrible for Princess Marya was that since the time of her father’s illness (even almost earlier, wasn’t it then, when she, expecting something, stayed with him), all those who had fallen asleep in her woke up in her. forgotten personal desires and hopes. What had not occurred to her for years - thoughts about a free life without the eternal fear of her father, even thoughts about the possibility of love and family happiness, like the temptations of the devil, constantly rushed through her imagination. No matter how she pushed herself away from herself, questions constantly came to her mind about how she would arrange her life now, after that. These were the temptations of the devil, and Princess Marya knew this. She knew that the only weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She became in a position of prayer, looked at the images, read the words of the prayer, but could not pray. She felt that now she was embraced by another world - of worldly, difficult and free activity, completely opposite to the moral world in which she had been imprisoned before and in which prayer was the best consolation. She could not pray and could not cry, and worldly care seized her.","Strange as it was for the princess to be aware of this feeling within her, it was there.

"После поступления Пети в полк казаков Оболенского и отъезда его в Белую Церковь, где формировался этот полк, на графиню нашел страх. Мысль о том, что оба ее сына находятся на войне, что оба они ушли из-под ее крыла, что нынче или завтра каждый из них, а может быть, и оба вместе, как три сына одной ее знакомой, могут быть убиты, в первый раз теперь, в это лето, с жестокой ясностью пришла ей в голову. Она пыталась вытребовать к себе Николая, хотела сама ехать к Пете, определить его куда-нибудь в Петербурге, но и то и другое оказывалось невозможным. Петя не мог быть возвращен иначе, как вместе с полком или посредством перевода в другой действующий полк. Николай находился где-то в армии и после своего последнего письма, в котором подробно описывал свою встречу с княжной Марьей, не давал о себе слуха. Графиня не спала ночей и, когда засыпала, видела во сне убитых сыновей. После многих советов и переговоров граф придумал наконец средство для успокоения графини. Он перевел Петю из полка Оболенского в полк Безухова, который формировался под Москвою. Хотя Петя и оставался в военной службе, но при этом переводе графиня имела утешенье видеть хотя одного сына у себя под крылышком и надеялась устроить своего Петю так, чтобы больше не выпускать его и записывать всегда в такие места службы, где бы он никак не мог попасть в сражение. Пока один Nicolas был в опасности, графине казалось (и она даже каялась в этом), что она любит старшего больше всех остальных детей; но когда меньшой, шалун, дурно учившийся, все ломавший в доме и всем надоевший Петя, этот курносый Петя, с своими веселыми черными глазами, свежим румянцем и чуть пробивающимся пушком на щеках, попал туда, к этим большим, страшным, жестоким мужчинам, которые там что-то сражаются и что-то в этом находят радостного, — тогда матери показалось, что его-то она любила больше, гораздо больше всех своих детей. Чем ближе подходило то время, когда должен был вернуться в Москву ожидаемый Петя, тем более увеличивалось беспокойство графини. Она думала уже, что никогда не дождется этого счастия. Присутствие не только Сони, но и любимой Наташи, даже мужа, раздражало графиню. «Что мне за дело до них, мне никого не нужно, кроме Пети!» — думала она.","After Petya entered the regiment of Obolensky's Cossacks and left for Belaya Tserkov, where this regiment was being formed, fear came over the countess. The thought that both her sons are at war, that both of them have left under her wing, that today or tomorrow each of them, and perhaps both together, like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, can be killed, in for the first time now, this summer, came to her mind with cruel clarity. She tried to get Nikolai to her, she wanted to go to Petya herself, to find him somewhere in Petersburg, but both turned out to be impossible. Petya could not be returned otherwise than together with the regiment or by transfer to another active regiment. Nikolai was somewhere in the army, and after his last letter, in which he described in detail his meeting with Princess Marya, he did not give a rumor about himself. The countess did not sleep at night, and when she fell asleep, she saw her murdered sons in a dream. After many councils and negotiations, the count finally came up with a means to calm the countess. He transferred Petya from the Obolensky regiment to the Bezukhov regiment, which was being formed near Moscow. Although Petya remained in military service, but with this transfer, the countess had the consolation to see at least one son under her wing and hoped to arrange her Petya so that she would no longer let him out and always enroll in such places of service where he could not get in any way. into battle. While Nicolas alone was in danger, it seemed to the Countess (and she even repented of this) that she loved the eldest more than all the other children; but when the younger one, a naughty fellow who had studied badly, broke everything in the house and bored everyone with Petya, this snub-nosed Petya, with his merry black eyes, fresh blush and slightly piercing down on his cheeks, got there, to these big, terrible, cruel men who there they fight something and find something joyful in it - then it seemed to the mother that she loved him more, much more than all her children. The closer the time approached when the expected Petya was supposed to return to Moscow, the more the countess's anxiety increased. She already thought that she would never wait for this happiness. The presence of not only Sonya, but also her beloved Natasha, even her husband, irritated the countess. “What do I care about them, I don’t need anyone but Petya!” she thought.","After Petya joined Obolensky's Cossack regiment and left for Belaya Tserkov, where the regiment was being formed, the countess was overcome with fear. The thought that both of her sons were at war, that they were both no longer under her wing, that today or tomorrow either one of them, and maybe both together, like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, might be killed, now for the first time, during that summer, came to her mind with a cruel clarity. She tried to call Nikolai back, tried to go to Petya herself, or to arrange a place for him somewhere in Petersburg, but both proved impossible. Petya could not be sent back except with his regiment or by means of a transfer to another active regiment. Nikolai was somewhere with the army and, after his last letter, in which he had described in detail his meeting with Princess Marya, had not been heard from again.

Though Petya remained in military service, the countess, after this transfer, had the comfort of having at least one son under her wing, and hoped to arrange things for her Petya so that he would not leave her again and would always be assigned to places of service where there was no chance of his getting into battle. While Nicolas alone was in danger, it seemed to the countess (and she even felt sorry because of it) that she loved her eldest more than the rest of her children; but when her youngest, the mischief, the poor student, who broke everything in the house and pestered everybody, this snub-nosed Petya, with his merry, dark eyes, fresh ruddy cheeks barely touched with down, ended up there, with those big, frightening, cruel men, who were fighting over something, and found something joyful in it—it seemed to the mother that it was him that she loved more, much more than all her other children. The closer it came to the time when the awaited Petya was to return to Moscow, the more the countess's anxiety grew. She thought she would never live to see that happiness. The presence not only of Sonya, but of her favorite Natasha, even of her husband, vexed the countess. “What do I care about them, I don't need anyone but Petya!” she thought.","After Petya had joined Obolensky’s regiment of Cossacks and left for Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized with terror.

Petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nikolai was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess Marya.

Though Petya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her Petya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as Nicolas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest, the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show—when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it—then his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children. The nearer the time came for Petya to return, the more uneasy grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such happiness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even of her husband, irritated her. ‘What do I want with them? I want no one but Petya,’ she thought."

"До Бородинского сражения наши силы приблизительно относились к французским как пять к шести, а после сражения как один к двум, то есть до сражения сто тысяч; ста двадцати, а после сражения пятьдесят к ста. А вместе с тем умный и опытный Кутузов принял сражение. Наполеон же, гениальный полководец, как его называют, дал сражение, теряя четверть армии и еще более растягивая свою линию. Ежели скажут, что, заняв Москву, он думал, как занятием Вены, кончить кампанию, то против этого есть много доказательств. Сами историки Наполеона рассказывают, что еще от Смоленска он хотел остановиться, знал опасность своего растянутого положения знал, что занятие Москвы не будет концом кампании, потому что от Смоленска он видел, в каком положении оставлялись ему русские города, и не получал ни одного ответа на свои неоднократные заявления о желании вести переговоры.","Before the battle of Borodino, our forces were approximately in relation to the French as five to six, and after the battle as one to two, that is, before the battle, one hundred thousand; a hundred and twenty, and after the battle fifty to a hundred. And at the same time, the smart and experienced Kutuzov accepted the battle. Napoleon, the brilliant commander, as he is called, gave battle, losing a quarter of the army and stretching his line even more. If it is said that by occupying Moscow, he thought that by occupying Vienna he would end the campaign, then there is a lot of evidence against this. The historians of Napoleon themselves say that even from Smolensk he wanted to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, because from Smolensk he saw in what position the Russian cities were left to him, and did not receive a single answer to their repeated statements about their desire to negotiate.","Before the battle of Borodino, our forces were approximately five to six with the French, but after the battle they were one to two; that is, before the battle it was a hundred thousand to a hundred and twenty thousand, but after the battle it was fifty thousand to a hundred thousand. And yet the intelligent and experienced Kutuzov accepted battle. And Napoleon, a commander of genius, as they call him, offered battle, losing a quarter of his army and extending his line still more. If it is said that, by occupying Moscow, he thought to end the campaign, as he had by occupying Vienna, there are many arguments against it. Napoleon's historians themselves say that he already wanted to stop after Smolensk, that he knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, because after Smolensk he had seen the condition of the Russian towns abandoned to him, and he had not received a single response to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.","Before the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to the French was approximately as five to six, but after that battle as one to two: that is to say, before the battle we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand, and after the battle fifty thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutuzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow, as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon’s historians themselves tell us that from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolensk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate."

"Лаврушка (поняв, что это делалось, чтобы озадачить его, и что Наполеон думает, что он испугается), чтобы угодить новым господам, тотчас же притворился изумленным, ошеломленным, выпучил глаза и сделал такое же лицо, которое ему привычно было, когда его водили сечь. «A peine l'interprete de Napoleon, — говорит Тьер, — avait-il parle, que le Cosaque, saisi d'une sorte d'ebahissement, no profera plus une parole et marcha les yeux constamment attaches sur ce conquerant, dont le nom avait penetre jusqu'a lui, a travers les steppes de l'Orient.

Napoleon, having rewarded the Cossack, ordered to give him freedom, like a bird that is returned to its native fields. ]","Lavrushka (realizing that this had been done in order to take him aback, and that Napoleon thought he would become frightened), so as to cater to his new masters, instantly pretended to be amazed, dumbfounded, goggled his eyes, and made the same face he was accustomed to make when taken off to be whipped. “À peine l'interprète de Napoléon,” says Thiers, “avait-il parlé, que le Cosaque, saisi à une sorte d'ébahissement ne proféra plus une parole et marcha les yeux constamment attachés sur ce conquérant , dont le nom avait pénétré jusqu'à lui, à travers les steppes de l'Orient.

"Как ни лестно было французам обвинять зверство Растопчина и русским обвинять злодея Бонапарта или потом влагать героический факел в руки своего народа, нельзя не видеть, что такой непосредственной причины пожара не могло быть, потому что Москва должна была сгореть, как должна сгореть каждая деревня, фабрика, всякий дом, из которого выйдут хозяева и в который пустят хозяйничать и варить себе кашу чужих людей. Москва сожжена жителями, это правда; но не теми жителями, которые оставались в ней, а теми, которые выехали из нее. Москва, занятая неприятелем, не осталась цела, как Берлин, Вена и другие города, только вследствие того, что жители ее не подносили хлеба-соли и ключей французам, а выехали из нее.","No matter how flattering it was for the French to blame the atrocities of Rastopchin and for the Russians to blame the villain Bonaparte or then to put the heroic torch into the hands of their people, one cannot but see that there could not be such a direct cause of the fire, because Moscow had to burn down, as every village, factory should burn down , every house from which the owners will come out and into which they will be allowed to host and cook their own porridge of strangers. Moscow is burned down by the inhabitants, it is true; but not by those inhabitants who remained in it, but by those who left it. Moscow, occupied by the enemy, did not remain intact, like Berlin, Vienna and other cities, only due to the fact that its inhabitants did not bring bread and salt and keys to the French, but left it.","Flattering as it was for the French to blame the brutality of Rastopchin and for the Russians to blame the villain Bonaparte, or later to place the heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not to see that there could be no such immediate causes for the burning, because Moscow had to burn down, just as any village, any factory, any house has to burn down which has been left by its owners, and in which strangers are allowed to take over and start cooking kasha for themselves. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, true; but not by the inhabitants who stayed in it, but by those who left it. Occupied by the enemy, Moscow did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other cities, only because its inhabitants did not bring out bread and salt and the keys to the city for the French, but left it.","However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rastopchin’s ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burnt by its inhabitants it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys of the city."

"Когда еще государь был в Вильне, армия была разделена натрое: 1-я армия находилась под начальством Барклая де Толли, 2-я под начальством Багратиона, 3-я под начальством Тормасова. Государь находился при первой армии, но не в качестве главнокомандующего. В приказе не было сказано, что государь будет командовать, сказано только, что государь будет при армии. Кроме того, при государе лично не было штаба главнокомандующего, а был штаб императорской главной квартиры. При нем был начальник императорского штаба генерал-квартирмейстер князь Волконский, генералы, флигель-адъютанты, дипломатические чиновники и большое количество иностранцев, но не было штаба армии. Кроме того, без должности при государе находились: Аракчеев — бывший военный министр, граф Бенигсен — по чину старший из генералов, великий князь цесаревич Константин Павлович, граф Румянцев — канцлер, Штейн — бывший прусский министр, Армфельд — шведский генерал, Пфуль — главный составитель плана кампании, генерал-адъютант Паулучи — сардинский выходец, Вольцоген и многие другие. Хотя эти лица и находились без военных должностей при армии, но по своему положению имели влияние, и часто корпусный начальник и даже главнокомандующий не знал, в качестве чего спрашивает или советует то или другое Бенигсен, или великий князь, или Аракчеев, или князь Волконский, и не знал, от его ли лица или от государя истекает такое-то приказание в форме совета и нужно или не нужно исполнять его. Но это была внешняя обстановка, существенный же смысл присутствия государя и всех этих лиц, с придворной точки (а в присутствии государя все делаются придворными), всем был ясен. Он был следующий: государь не принимал на себя звания главнокомандующего, но распоряжался всеми армиями; люди, окружавшие его, были его помощники. Аракчеев был верный исполнитель-блюститель порядка и телохранитель государя; Бенигсен был помещик Виленской губернии, который как будто делал les honneurs [был занят делом приема государя] края, а в сущности был хороший генерал, полезный для совета и для того, чтобы иметь его всегда наготове на смену Барклая. Великий князь был тут потому, что это было ему угодно. Бывший министр Штейн был тут потому, что он был полезен для совета, и потому, что император Александр высоко ценил его личные качества. Армфельд был злой ненавистник Наполеона и генерал, уверенный в себе, что имело всегда влияние на Александра. Паулучи был тут потому, что он был смел и решителен в речах, Генерал-адъютанты были тут потому, что они везде были, где государь, и, наконец, — главное — Пфуль был тут потому, что он, составив план войны против Наполеона и заставив Александра поверить в целесообразность этого плана, руководил всем делом войны. При Пфуле был Вольцоген, передававший мысли Пфуля в более доступной форме, чем сам Пфуль, резкий, самоуверенный до презрения ко всему, кабинетный теоретик.","When the sovereign was still in Vilna, the army was divided into three: the 1st army was under the command of Barclay de Tolly, the 2nd under the command of Bagration, the 3rd under the command of Tormasov. The sovereign was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. The order did not say that the sovereign would command, it only said that the sovereign would be with the army. In addition, under the sovereign personally there was no headquarters of the commander-in-chief, but there was the headquarters of the imperial main apartment. Under him was the chief of the imperial headquarters, Quartermaster General Prince Volkonsky, generals, aide-de-camp, diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners, but there was no army headquarters. In addition, without a position with the sovereign were: Arakcheev - a former minister of war, Count Benigsen - the eldest of the generals, Grand Duke Tsarevich Konstantin Pavlovich, Count Rumyantsev - chancellor, Stein - a former Prussian minister, Armfeld - a Swedish general, Pfuel - the main compiler campaign plan, Adjutant General Pauluchi, a native of Sardinia, Wolzogen, and many others. Although these persons were without military positions in the army, they had influence by their position, and often the corps chief and even the commander in chief did not know what Benigsen, or the Grand Duke, or Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonsky was asking or advising for. and did not know whether such and such an order in the form of advice was issued from him or from the sovereign and whether it was necessary or not to execute it. But this was an external situation, but the essential meaning of the presence of the sovereign and all these persons, from the court point (and in the presence of the sovereign, everyone becomes courtiers), was clear to everyone. He was as follows: the sovereign did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies; the people around him were his assistants. Arakcheev was a faithful executor-guardian of order and bodyguard of the sovereign; Bennigsen was a landowner of the Vilna province, who seemed to be doing les honneurs [was busy with the business of receiving the sovereign] of the region, but in essence he was a good general, useful for advice and in order to have him always ready to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was here because it pleased him. The former minister, Stein, was there because he was useful for advice, and because Emperor Alexander highly valued his personal qualities. Armfeld was a bitter hater of Napoleon and a self-confident general, which always had an influence on Alexander. Pauluchi was here because he was bold and resolute in his speeches, the Adjutant Generals were here because they were everywhere where the sovereign was, and, finally, and most importantly, Pfuel was here because he, having drawn up a plan of war against Napoleon and forcing Alexander to believe in the expediency of this plan, he directed the whole matter of the war. Under Pfule there was Wolzogen, who conveyed Pfuel's thoughts in a more accessible form than Pfuel himself, a sharp, self-confident to the point of contempt for everything, an armchair theorist.","While the sovereign was still in Vilno, the army was divided in three: the first army was under the command of Barclay de Tolly, the second under the command of Bagration, the third under the command of Tormasov. The sovereign as with the first army, but not as commander in chief. It was not stated in the orders that the sovereign would command, but only that the sovereign would be present in the army. Besides that, the sovereign personally did not have a commander in chief's staff with him, but the staff of the imperial headquarters. With him were the chief of the imperial staff, the quartermaster general Prince Volkonsky, generals, imperial adjutants, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but there was no army staff. Besides them, the following persons were with the sovereign without any specific function: Arakcheev, the former minister of war; Count Bennigsen, the highest ranking of the generals; the Grand Duke Tsarevich Konstantin Pavlovich; Count Rumyantsev, the chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfelt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of campaign; the adjutant general Paulucci, a native of Sardinia; Wolzogen, and many others. Though these people were with the army without any military function, they had influence through their position, and often a corps commander and even the commander in chief did not know in what capacity Bennigsen, or the grand duke, or Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonsky asked or advised one thing or another, and did not know whether it was from his own person or from the sovereign that this or that order in the form of advice proceeded and whether or not it was necessary to carry it out. But these were externals, while the essential meaning of the presence of the sovereign and of all these persons—from the court point of view (and in the sovereign's presence everyone becomes a courtier)—was clear to everyone. It was the following: the sovereign did not take upon himself the title of commander in chief, but he gave orders to all the armies; the people of his entourage were his assistants. Arakcheev was the faithful executor-protector of order and the sovereign's bodyguard; Bennigsen was a landowner of Vilno province, who was as if doing les honneurs for the province, but in reality was a good general, useful for his advice and for always being at hand to replace Barclay. The grand duke was there because such was his pleasure. The ex-minister Stein was there because he was useful for his advice and because the emperor Alexander valued his personal qualities highly. Armfelt was a vicious hater of Napoleon and a self-assured general, which always had an effect on Alexander. Paulucci was there because he was bold and resolute in his speech. The adjutant generals were there because they were wherever the sovereign was, and finally—above all—Pfuel was there because, having drawn up the plan of war against Napoleon and having made Alexander believe in the advisability of this plan, he was directing the whole business of the war. Pfuel had come with Wolzogen, who conveyed Pfuel's thoughts in a form more accessible than did Pfuel himself, a closet theoretician, abrupt, and self-confident to the point of despising everything.","While the Emperor had still been at Vilna the forces had been divided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the army under Bagration, and thirdly the one commanded by Tormasov. The Emperor was with the first army but not as commander-in-chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command, but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor moreover had with him not a commander-in-chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster-General Prince Volkonsky, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these there were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakcheev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich;* Count Rumyantsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfelt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci,* an adjutant-general and Sardinian émigré; Wolzogen*—and many others. Though these men had no military appointment in the army their position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or even the commander-in-chief, did not know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonsky, or was given this or that advice, and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor, and whether it had to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people, from a courtier’s point of view (and in an Emperor’s vicinity all become courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not assume the title of commander-in-chief but disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order, and acted as the sovereign’s bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna province who appeared to be doing the honours of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally. Armfelt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander. Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The adjutants-general were there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against Napoleon, and, having induced Alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel’s thought in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself—who was a harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else—was able to do."

"Из всех этих партий, в то самое время, как князь Андрей приехал к армии, собралась еще одна, девятая партия, начинавшая поднимать свой голос.

"Ополченцы принесли князя Андрея к лесу, где стояли фуры и где был перевязочный пункт. Перевязочный пункт состоял из трех раскинутых, с завороченными полами, палаток на краю березника. В березнике стояла фуры и лошади. Лошади в хребтугах ели овес, и воробьи слетали к ним и подбирали просыпанные зерна. Воронья, чуя кровь, нетерпеливо каркая, перелетали на березах. Вокруг палаток, больше чем на две десятины места, лежали, сидели, стояли окровавленные люди в различных одеждах. Вокруг раненых, с унылыми и внимательными лицами, стояли толпы солдат-носильщиков, которых тщетно отгоняли от этого места распоряжавшиеся порядком офицеры. Не слушая офицеров, солдаты стояли, опираясь на носилки, и пристально, как будто пытаясь понять трудное значение зрелища, смотрели на то, что делалось перед ними. Из палаток слышались то громкие, злые вопли, то жалобные стенания. Изредка выбегали оттуда фельдшера за водой и указывали на тех, который надо было вносить. Раненые, ожидая у палатки своей очереди, хрипели, стонали, плакали, кричали, ругались, просили водки. Некоторые бредили. Князя Андрея, как полкового командира, шагая через неперевязанных раненых, пронесли ближе к одной из палаток и остановились, ожидая приказания. Князь Андрей открыл глаза и долго не мог понять того, что делалось вокруг него. Луг, полынь, пашня, черный крутящийся мячик и его страстный порыв любви к жизни вспомнились ему. В двух шагах от него, громко говоря и обращая на себя общее внимание, стоял, опершись на сук и с обвязанной головой, высокий, красивый, черноволосый унтер-офицер. Он был ранен в голову и ногу пулями. Вокруг него, жадно слушая его речь, собралась толпа раненых и носильщиков.","The militia brought Prince Andrei to the forest, where the wagons stood and where there was a dressing station. The dressing station consisted of three outstretched tents with rolled-up floors on the edge of a birch forest. There were wagons and horses in the birch forest. Horses in the ridges ate oats, and sparrows flew to them and picked up spilled grains. Crows, smelling blood, cawing impatiently, flew over on birches. Around the tents, more than two acres of space, lay, sat, stood bloody people in various clothes. Around the wounded, with sad and attentive faces, crowds of porter soldiers stood, who were vainly driven away from this place by the officers in charge of order. Not listening to the officers, the soldiers stood leaning on the stretcher and intently, as if trying to understand the difficult meaning of the spectacle, looked at what was happening in front of them. Loud, angry cries, then plaintive moans were heard from the tents. From time to time paramedics ran out of there for water and pointed to those who had to be brought in. The wounded, waiting at the tent for their turn, wheezed, moaned, cried, shouted, cursed, asked for vodka. Some were delusional. Prince Andrei, as a regimental commander, walking over the unbandaged wounded, was carried closer to one of the tents and stopped, waiting for orders. Prince Andrei opened his eyes and for a long time could not understand what was happening around him. Meadow, wormwood, arable land, a black spinning ball and his passionate outburst of love for life came to his mind. Two paces from him, speaking loudly and drawing general attention to himself, stood leaning on a bough and with his head tied, a tall, handsome, black-haired non-commissioned officer. He was wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his speech, a crowd of wounded and porters gathered.","The militiamen brought Prince Andrei to the woods where the carts stood and where the dressing station was. The dressing station consisted of three tents with turned-back flaps pitched at the edge of a birch grove. In the birch grove stood carts and horses. The horses were eating oats from their nosebags, and sparrows flew down to them, pecking up the spilled grain. Crows, scenting blood, crowing impatiently, flew about in the birches. Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodied men lay, sat, or stood in various clothes. Around the wounded, with dejected, attentive faces, stood crowds of stretcher bearers, whom the officers in charge of keeping order tried in vain to drive away from the place. Not heeding the officers, the bearers stood leaning on the stretchers and, as if trying to comprehend the difficult meaning of the spectacle, looked intently at what was going on before them. From the tents came now loud, angry screams, now a pitiful wailing, Occasionally surgeons' assistants ran out to fetch water and pointed to those who were to be carried in. The wounded, waiting their turn by the tents, wheezed, moaned, wept, shouted, cursed, begged for vodka. Some were delirious. As Prince Andrei was a regimental commander, the bearers, stepping among the not-yet-treated men, brought him close to one of the tents and stopped, waiting for orders. Prince Andrei opened his eyes and for a long time could not understand what was happening around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the black, spinning ball, and his passionate fit of love for life. Two steps away from him, talking loudly and attracting general attention to himself, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired sergeant, leaning on a branch, his head bandaged. He had bullet wounds in his head and leg. Around him, listening eagerly to his talk, gathered a crowd of wounded and stretcher bearers.","The militiamen carried Prince Andrei to the field hospital by the wood, where wagons were stationed. The field hospital consisted of three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers’ orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries, and now plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrei’s bearers stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrei opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired non-commissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered."
"В вечер 26-го августа и Кутузов, и вся русская армия были уверены, что Бородинское сражение выиграно. Кутузов так и писал государю.

"Жителей в Москве не было, и солдаты, как вода в песок, всачивались в нее и неудержимой звездой расплывались во все стороны от Кремля, в который они вошли прежде всего. Солдаты-кавалеристы, входя в оставленный со всем добром купеческий дом и находя стойла не только для своих лошадей, но и лишние, все-таки шли рядом занимать другой дом, который им казался лучше. Многие занимали несколько домов, надписывая мелом, кем он занят, и спорили и даже дрались с другими командами. Не успев поместиться еще, солдаты бежали на улицу осматривать город и, по слуху о том, что все брошено, стремились туда, где можно было забрать даром ценные вещи. Начальники ходили останавливать солдат и сами вовлекались невольно в те же действия. В Каретном ряду оставались лавки с экипажами, и генералы толпились там, выбирая себе коляски и кареты. Остававшиеся жители приглашали к себе начальников, надеясь тем обеспечиться от грабежа. Богатств было пропасть, и конца им не видно было; везде, кругом того места, которое заняли французы, были еще неизведанные, незанятые места, в которых, как казалось французам, было еще больше богатств. И Москва все дальше и дальше всасывала их в себя. Точно, как вследствие того, что нальется вода на сухую землю, исчезает вода и сухая земля; точно так же вследствие того, что голодное войско вошло в обильный, пустой город, уничтожилось войско, и уничтожился обильный город; и сделалась грязь, сделались пожары и мародерство.","There were no inhabitants in Moscow, and the soldiers, like water into the sand, soaked into it and spread like an unstoppable star in all directions from the Kremlin, into which they entered first of all. The cavalry soldiers, entering the merchant's house left with all the good and finding stalls not only for their horses, but also superfluous, nevertheless went side by side to occupy another house, which seemed better to them. Many occupied several houses, writing with chalk what he was doing, and arguing and even fighting with other teams. Not having time to fit yet, the soldiers ran out into the street to inspect the city and, according to the rumor that everything was abandoned, rushed to where they could pick up valuable things for free. The commanders went to stop the soldiers and themselves were involuntarily involved in the same actions. There were shops with carriages in Karetny Ryad, and the generals crowded there, choosing carriages and carriages for themselves. The remaining inhabitants invited the chiefs to their place, hoping that they would be protected from robbery. There was an abyss of wealth, and there was no end in sight; everywhere, around the place that the French had occupied, there were still unexplored, unoccupied places in which, as it seemed to the French, there were even more riches. And Moscow sucked them further and further into itself. Exactly as due to the fact that water is poured onto dry land, water and dry land disappear; in the same way, because a hungry army entered a plentiful, empty city, the army was destroyed, and a plentiful city was destroyed; and there was mud, fires and looting.","There were no inhabitants in Moscow, and the soldiers were absorbed by it like water by sand, and irrepressibly spread starwise in all directions from the Kremlin, which they occupied first of all. Cavalrymen, entering a merchant's house abandoned with all its goods, and finding stalls there not only for their own horses but extra ones as well, still went to occupy the house next door, which seemed better to them. Many occupied several houses, writing on them in chalk who the occupier was, and quarreled and even fought with other units. Before they had time to settle, the soldiers ran outside to look over the city, and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed wherever valuable things could be had for nothing. Officers went to stop the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into the same acts. In Carriage Row there were abandoned shops with vehicles, and generals crowded there, picking out caleches and carriages for themselves. The remaining inhabitants invited the officers to stay with them, hoping to protect themselves from being looted. There was an abundance of riches and no end of them in sight; everywhere around the area occupied by the French, there were other areas, unknown and unoccupied, in which, as it seemed to the French, there were still greater riches. And Moscow absorbed them into itself more and more. Just as when water is poured onto dry ground, the result is that both water and dry ground disappear, so when the famished army entered the abundant, empty city, the result was that the army was annihilated and the abundant city was annihilated; there was mud, there were fires and looting.","No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers—like water percolating through sand—spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. The cavalry, on entering a merchant’s house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them and quarrelled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city, and hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers, and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row, carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select calèches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilt on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city."
"Все это, так же как и другие пункты диспозиции, не было и не могло быть исполнено. Пройдя Бородино, вице-король был отбит на Колоче и не мог пройти дальше; дивизии же Морана и Фриана не взяли редута, а были отбиты, и редут уже в конце сражения был захвачен кавалерией (вероятно, непредвиденное дело для Наполеона и неслыханное). Итак, ни одно из распоряжений диспозиции не было и не могло быть исполнено. Но в диспозиции сказано, что по вступлении таким образом в бой будут даны приказания, соответственные действиям неприятеля, и потому могло бы казаться, что во время сражения будут сделаны Наполеоном все нужные распоряжения; но этого не было и не могло быть потому, что во все время сражения Наполеон находился так далеко от него, что (как это и оказалось впоследствии) ход сражения ему не мог быть известен и ни одно распоряжение его во время сражения не могло быть исполнено.","All this, as well as other points of the disposition, was not and could not be executed. Having passed Borodino, the viceroy was repulsed on Kolocha and could not go further; the divisions of Moran and Friant did not take the redoubt, but were repulsed, and the redoubt was captured by cavalry at the end of the battle (probably an unforeseen and unheard of thing for Napoleon). So, none of the orders of the disposition was and could not be executed. But the disposition says that upon entering the battle in this way, orders will be given corresponding to the actions of the enemy, and therefore it might seem that during the battle all the necessary orders will be made by Napoleon; but this was not and could not be because during the entire battle Napoleon was so far away from him that (as it turned out later) he could not know the course of the battle and not a single order of his during the battle could be executed.","All that, like the other points of the disposition, was not and could not be carried out. Having gone through Borodino, the viceroy was driven back on the Kolocha and could go no further; the divisions of Morand and Gérard did not take the redoubt, but were repulsed, and the redoubt was taken only at the end of the battle by the cavalry (probably something unforeseen by and unheard-of for Napoleon). Thus, none of the instructions of the disposition were or could be carried out. But it was said in the disposition that after entering into combat in this way, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy's actions, and therefore it would seem that, during the battle, Napoleon would be giving all the necessary instructions; but that was not and could not be done, because during the whole time of the battle, Napoleon was so far away from it that (as it turned out afterwards) the course of the battle could not be known to him and not one of his instructions during the battle could be carried out.","All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could not be executed. After passing through Borodino the viceroy was driven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and Gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy’s movements, and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle, and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed."
"Наташа побежала в дом и на цыпочках вошла в полуотворенную дверь диванной, из которой пахло уксусом и гофманскими каплями.","Natasha ran into the house and tiptoed into the half-open door of the sofa room, from which there was a smell of vinegar and drops of Hoffmann.","Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door to the sitting room, from which came the smell of vinegar and Hoffmann's drops.","Natasha ran into the house, and went on tiptoe through the half-open door into the sitting-room where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman’s drops."
"Из всех этих лиц более всех возбуждал участие в князе Андрее озлобленный, решительный и бестолково-самоуверенный Пфуль. Он один из всех здесь присутствовавших лиц, очевидно, ничего не желал для себя, ни к кому не питал вражды, а желал только одного — приведения в действие плана, составленного по теории, выведенной им годами трудов. Он был смешон, был неприятен своей ироничностью, но вместе с тем он внушал невольное уважение своей беспредельной преданностью идее. Кроме того, во всех речах всех говоривших была, за исключением Пфуля, одна общая черта, которой не было на военном совете в 1805-м году, — это был теперь хотя и скрываемый, но панический страх перед гением Наполеона, страх, который высказывался в каждом возражении. Предполагали для Наполеона всё возможным, ждали его со всех сторон и его страшным именем разрушали предположения один другого. Один Пфуль, казалось, и его, Наполеона, считал таким же варваром, как и всех оппонентов своей теории. Но, кроме чувства уважения, Пфуль внушал князю Андрею и чувство жалости. По тому тону, с которым с ним обращались придворные, по тому, что позволил себе сказать Паулучи императору, но главное по некоторой отчаянности выражении самого Пфуля, видно было, что другие знали и он сам чувствовал, что падение его близко. И, несмотря на свою самоуверенность и немецкую ворчливую ироничность, он был жалок с своими приглаженными волосами на височках и торчавшими на затылке кисточками. Он, видимо, хотя и скрывал это под видом раздражения и презрения, он был в отчаянии оттого, что единственный теперь случай проверить на огромном опыте и доказать всему миру верность своей теории ускользал от него.","Of all these persons, the embittered, resolute and stupidly self-confident Pful was the most arousing interest in Prince Andrei. He, one of all the people present here, obviously did not want anything for himself, did not harbor enmity towards anyone, but wanted only one thing - to put into action the plan drawn up according to the theory he had deduced over the years of labor. He was ridiculous, was unpleasant with his irony, but at the same time he inspired involuntary respect with his boundless devotion to the idea. In addition, in all the speeches of all the speakers, with the exception of Pfuel, there was one common feature that was not at the military council in 1805 - it was now, although hidden, but a panic fear of the genius of Napoleon, a fear that was expressed in every objection. Everything was supposed to be possible for Napoleon, they were waiting for him from all sides, and with his terrible name they destroyed one another's assumptions. One Pfuel, it seemed, considered him, Napoleon, the same barbarian as all the opponents of his theory. But, in addition to a sense of respect, Pfuel inspired Prince Andrei with a sense of pity. From the tone with which the courtiers treated him, from what Pauluchi allowed himself to say to the emperor, but most importantly from the somewhat desperate expression of Pfuel himself, it was clear that others knew and he himself felt that his fall was near. And, despite his self-confidence and German grumpy irony, he was pitiful with his smoothed hair on the temples and tassels sticking out at the back of his head. Apparently, although he hid it under the guise of irritation and contempt, he was in despair because the only opportunity now to test it on vast experience and prove to the whole world the correctness of his theory eluded him.","Of all these persons, the one who most awakened Prince Andrei's sympathy was the embittered, resolute, and senselessly self-assured Pfuel. He alone of all the persons present there obviously desired nothing for himself, felt no enmity against anyone, and desired only one thing: the putting into action of a plan worked out according to a theory arrived at through years of labor. He was ridiculous, he was unpleasant in his irony, but at the same time he inspired an involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to his idea. Besides that, in all the speeches of all the speakers, with the exception of Pfuel, there was one common feature which had not been there at the council of war in 1805: there was now, however concealed, a panic fear before the genius of Napoleon, a fear that voiced itself in every objection. Every possible supposition was made with regard to Napoleon, he was expected on all sides, and with his terrible name they demolished each other's suggestions. Pfuel alone, it seemed, considered him, Napoleon, as much a barbarian as all the opponents of his theory. But, besides a feeling of respect, Pfuel inspired a feeling of pity in Prince Andrei. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him, from what Paulucci had allowed himself to say to the emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel's own expressions, it was clear that the others knew and he himself sensed that his fall was near. And despite his self-assurance and grumbling German irony, he was pitiful with his hair slicked down on his temples and tufts sticking out on his nape. Though he concealed it behind an appearance of irritation and contempt, he was clearly in despair, because the sole remaining opportunity of making an enormous experiment and proving the correctness of his theory to the whole world was slipping away from him.","Of all these men Prince Andrei sympathized most with Pfuel, angry, determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred against any one, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon’s genius, which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other’s proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrei. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him, and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel’s own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world, was slipping away from him."

На другом столе, около которого толпилось много народа, на спине лежал большой, полный человек с закинутой назад головой (вьющиеся волоса, их цвет и форма головы показались странно знакомы князю Андрею). Несколько человек фельдшеров навалились на грудь этому человеку и держали его. Белая большая полная нога быстро и часто, не переставая, дергалась лихорадочными трепетаниями.

Several paramedics fell on the man's chest and held him. The big, white, plump leg quickly and often, without ceasing, twitched with feverish flutters. This man sobbed convulsively and choked. Two doctors silently - one was pale and trembling - were doing something on the other, red leg of this man.

Several assistants leaned their weight on the man's chest and held him down. One big, sturdy white leg kept jerking quickly and rhythmically with a feverish quivering.

He looked at Prince Andrei's face and quickly turned away.","‘Ooh, ooh, ooh!’ grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and prolonged yells.

"Прежде Ростов, идя в дело, боялся; теперь он не испытывал ни малейшего чувства страха. Не оттого он не боялся, что он привык к огню (к опасности нельзя привыкнуть), но оттого, что он выучился управлять своей душой перед опасностью. Он привык, идя в дело, думать обо всем, исключая того, что, казалось, было бы интереснее всего другого, — о предстоящей опасности. Сколько он ни старался, ни упрекал себя в трусости первое время своей службы, он не мог этого достигнуть; но с годами теперь это сделалось само собою. Он ехал теперь рядом с Ильиным между березами, изредка отрывая листья с веток, которые попадались под руку, иногда дотрогиваясь ногой до паха лошади, иногда отдавая, не поворачиваясь, докуренную трубку ехавшему сзади гусару, с таким спокойным и беззаботным видом, как будто он ехал кататься. Ему жалко было смотреть на взволнованное лицо Ильина, много и беспокойно говорившего; он по опыту знал то мучительное состояние ожидания страха и смерти, в котором находился корнет, и знал, что ничто, кроме времени, не поможет ему.","Before, Rostov, going into business, was afraid; now he did not feel the least sense of fear.

No matter how hard he tried, or reproached himself for cowardice during the first time of his service, he could not achieve this; but over the years it has now become self-evident. He was now riding beside Ilyin between the birches, occasionally tearing leaves from the branches that came to hand, sometimes touching the horse's groin with his foot, sometimes giving, without turning, his smoked pipe to the hussar who was riding behind, with such a calm and carefree look, as if he were riding ride. It was a pity to him to look at the agitated face of Ilyin, who spoke a lot and uneasily; he knew from experience that agonizing state of expectation of fear and death in which the cornet was, and he knew that nothing but time would help him.","Formerly, going into action, Rostov had been afraid; now he did not feel the least fear.

"В недостроенном доме на Варварке, внизу которого был питейный дом, слышались пьяные крики и песни. На лавках у столов в небольшой грязной комнате сидело человек десять фабричных. Все они, пьяные, потные, с мутными глазами, напруживаясь и широко разевая рты, пели какую-то песню. Они пели врозь, с трудом, с усилием, очевидно, не для того, что им хотелось петь, но для того только, чтобы доказать, что они пьяны и гуляют. Один из них, высокий белокурый малый в чистой синей чуйке, стоял над ними. Лицо его с тонким прямым носом было бы красиво, ежели бы не тонкие, поджатые, беспрестанно двигающиеся губы и мутные и нахмуренные, неподвижные глаза. Он стоял над теми, которые пели, и, видимо воображая себе что-то, торжественно и угловато размахивал над их головами засученной по локоть белой рукой, грязные пальцы которой он неестественно старался растопыривать. Рукав его чуйки беспрестанно спускался, и малый старательно левой рукой опять засучивал его, как будто что-то было особенно важное в том, чтобы эта белая жилистая махавшая рука была непременно голая. В середине песни в сенях и на крыльце послышались крики драки и удары. Высокий малый махнул рукой.","In the unfinished house on Varvarka, at the bottom of which there was a drinking house, drunken screams and songs were heard.

The sleeve of his chuyka was constantly going down, and the fellow diligently rolled it up again with his left hand, as if there was something especially important in the fact that this white sinewy waving arm was always naked.

They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on the spree. One, a tall fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows in the passage and the porch. The tall lad waved his arm."

"— Урруру! — вторя завалившемуся потолку амбара, из которого несло запахом лепешек от сгоревшего хлеба, заревела толпа. Пламя вспыхнуло и осветило оживленно радостные и измученные лица людей, стоявших вокруг пожара.","— Urruru! - Echoing the collapsed ceiling of the barn, from which there was a smell of cakes from burnt bread, the crowd roared. The flame flared up and illuminated the animatedly joyful and exhausted faces of the people standing around the fire.","“Hoo-hoo-hoo!” roared the crowd, seconding the collapsed ceiling of the barn, from which came a smell of pancakes produced by the burning grain. The flames flared up and illuminated the animatedly joyful and worn-out faces of the people who stood around the fire.","‘Ou-rou-rou!’ yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cake-like aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators."
"Но хотя уже к концу сражения люди чувствовали весь ужас своего поступка, хотя они и рады бы были перестать, какая-то непонятная, таинственная сила еще продолжала руководить ими, и, запотелые, в порохе и крови, оставшиеся по одному на три, артиллеристы, хотя и спотыкаясь и задыхаясь от усталости, приносили заряды, заряжали, наводили, прикладывали фитили; и ядра так же быстро и жестоко перелетали с обеих сторон и расплюскивали человеческое тело, и продолжало совершаться то страшное дело, которое совершается не по воле людей, а по воле того, кто руководит людьми и мирами.","But although by the end of the battle people felt the full horror of their act, although they would have been glad to stop, some incomprehensible, mysterious force still continued to guide them, and, sweaty, in gunpowder and blood, remaining one by three, artillerymen, although stumbling and suffocating from fatigue, they brought charges, charged, directed, applied wicks; and the cannonballs just as quickly and cruelly flew from both sides and flattened the human body, and that terrible deed continued to be done, which is done not by the will of people, but by the will of the one who guides people and worlds.","But though by the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of their actions, though they would have been glad to stop, some incomprehensible, mysterious power still went on governing them, and the artillery men, sweaty, covered with powder and blood, reduced to one in three, though stumbling and gasping from fatigue, kept bringing charges, loaded, aimed, applied the slow match; and the cannonballs, with the same speed and cruelty, flew from both sides and crushed human bodies flat, and the terrible thing continued to be accomplished, which was accomplished not by the will of men, but by the will of Him who governs people and worlds.","But though towards the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon-balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work, which was not done by the will of a man, but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds, continued."
"Лицо стало утешать ее; Элен же сквозь слезы говорила (как бы забывшись), что ничто не может мешать ей выйти замуж, что есть примеры (тогда еще мало было примеров, но она назвала Наполеона и других высоких особ), что она никогда не была женою своего мужа, что она была принесена в жертву.","The face began to comfort her; Helen, through tears, said (as if forgetting) that nothing could prevent her from getting married, that there were examples (there were still few examples then, but she named Napoleon and other high persons), that she had never been the wife of her husband, that she was sacrificed.","The person began to comfort her; Hélène said through her tears (as if forgetting herself) that nothing could prevent her from marrying, that there were examples (there were still few examples then, but she named Napoleon and other highly placed persons), that she had never been a wife to her husband, that she had been sacrificed.","The prince tried to comfort her, but Hélène, as if quite distraught, said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying, that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had never been her husband’s wife, and that she had been sacrificed."

"Действительно, хотя уже гораздо дальше, чем прежде, все Ростовы увидали Пьера или человека, необыкновенно похожего на Пьера, в кучерском кафтане, шедшего по улице с нагнутой головой и серьезным лицом, подле маленького безбородого старичка, имевшего вид лакея. Старичок этот заметил высунувшееся на него лицо из кареты и, почтительно дотронувшись до локтя Пьера, что-то сказал ему, указывая на карету. Пьер долго не мог понять того, что он говорил; так он, видимо, погружен был в свои мысли. Наконец, когда он понял его, посмотрел по указанию и, узнав Наташу, в ту же секунду отдаваясь первому впечатлению, быстро направился к карете. Но, пройдя шагов десять, он, видимо, вспомнив что-то, остановился.","Indeed, although much further away than before, all the Rostovs saw Pierre or a man unusually resembling Pierre, in a coachman's caftan, walking down the street with his head bowed and a serious face, next to a little beardless old man who looked like a footman. This old man noticed a face sticking out at him from the carriage and, respectfully touching Pierre's elbow, said something to him, pointing to the carriage. For a long time Pierre could not understand what he was saying; so he seemed to be immersed in his own thoughts. Finally, when he understood him, he looked at the instructions and, recognizing Natasha, giving himself up to the first impression at that very moment, quickly went to the carriage. But after walking ten paces, he, apparently remembering something, stopped.","Indeed, though now much further away than before, all the Rostovs saw Pierre, or a man extraordinarily like Pierre, in a coachman's kaftan, walking down the street with a bowed head and a serious face, beside a little beardless old man who looked like a footman.

"«Обожаемый друг души моей, — писал он. — Ничто, кроме чести, не могло бы удержать меня от возвращения в деревню. Но теперь, перед открытием кампании, я бы счел себя бесчестным не только перед всеми товарищами, но и перед самим собою, ежели бы я предпочел свое счастие своему долгу и любви к отечеству. Но это последняя разлука. Верь, что тотчас после войны, ежели я буду жив и все любим тобою, я брошу все и прилечу к тебе, чтобы прижать тебя уже навсегда к моей пламенной груди».","“Adorable friend of my soul,” he wrote. “Nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the village.

"Алпатыч вернулся в избу и, кликнув кучера, велел ему выезжать. Вслед за Алпатычем и за кучером вышли и все домочадцы Ферапонтова. Увидав дым и даже огни пожаров, видневшиеся теперь в начинавшихся сумерках, бабы, до тех пор молчавшие, вдруг заголосили, глядя на пожары. Как бы вторя им, послышались такие же плачи на других концах улицы.

Seeing the smoke and even the lights of the fires, which were now visible in the beginning twilight, the women, who had been silent until then, suddenly began to wail, looking at the fires. As if echoing them, similar cries were heard at the other ends of the street.

Действительно, всякий раз, когда являлись завоеватели, были и войны, отвечает ум человеческий, но это не доказывает, чтобы завоеватели были причинами войн и чтобы возможно было найти законы войны в личной деятельности одного человека. Всякий раз, когда я, глядя на свои часы, вижу, что стрелка подошла к десяти, я слышу, что в соседней церкви начинается благовест, но из того, что всякий раз, что стрелка приходит на десять часов тогда, как начинается благовест, я не имею права заключить, что положение стрелки есть причина движения колоколов.","“But whenever there were conquests, there were conquerors; whenever there were coups in the state, there were great people,” says history.

"Факты говорят очевидно, что ни Наполеон не предвидел опасности в движении на Москву, ни Александр и русские военачальники не думали тогда о заманивании Наполеона, а думали о противном. Завлечение Наполеона в глубь страны произошло не по чьему-нибудь плану (никто и не верил в возможность этого), а произошло от сложнейшей игры интриг, целей, желаний людей — участников войны, не угадывавших того, что должно быть, и того, что было единственным спасением России. Все происходит нечаянно. Армии разрезаны при начале кампании. Мы стараемся соединить их с очевидной целью дать сражение и удержать наступление неприятеля, но и этом стремлении к соединению, избегая сражений с сильнейшим неприятелем и невольно отходя под острым углом, мы заводим французов до Смоленска. Но мало того сказать, что мы отходим под острым углом потому, что французы двигаются между обеими армиями, — угол этот делается еще острее, и мы еще дальше уходим потому, что Барклай де Толли, непопулярный немец, ненавистен Багратиону (имеющему стать под его начальство), и Багратион, командуя 2-й армией, старается как можно дольше не присоединяться к Барклаю, чтобы не стать под его команду. Багратион долго не присоединяется (хотя в этом главная цель всех начальствующих лиц) потому, что ему кажется, что он на этом марше ставит в опасность свою армию и что выгоднее всего для него отступить левее и южнее, беспокоя с фланга и тыла неприятеля и комплектуя свою армию в Украине. А кажется, и придумано это им потому, что ему не хочется подчиняться ненавистному и младшему чином немцу Барклаю.","The facts clearly show that neither Napoleon foresaw the danger in moving towards Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian military leaders then think about luring Napoleon, but thought about the opposite. The lure of Napoleon into the interior of the country did not happen according to anyone's plan (no one believed in the possibility of this), but came from the most complex game of intrigues, goals, desires of people - participants in the war, who did not guess what should be, and what was Russia's only salvation. Everything happens by accident. The armies are cut at the start of the campaign. We try to combine them with the obvious goal of giving battle and holding the enemy's advance, but even in this desire to unite, avoiding battles with the strongest enemy and involuntarily retreating at an acute angle, we lead the French to Smolensk. But it is not enough to say that we are withdrawing at an acute angle because the French are moving between the two armies - this angle is becoming even sharper, and we are moving even further because Barclay de Tolly, an unpopular German, is hated by Bagration (who has to become under his command ), and Bagration, commanding the 2nd Army, tries not to join Barclay for as long as possible, so as not to become under his command. Bagration does not join for a long time (although this is the main goal of all commanding persons) because it seems to him that he is putting his army in danger on this march and that it is most advantageous for him to retreat to the left and south, harassing the enemy from the flank and rear and completing his army in Ukraine. And it seems that he invented it because he does not want to obey the hated and junior rank German Barclay.","The facts say the obvious thing, that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of moving on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders think then about luring Napoleon, but both thought the opposite. The drawing of Napoleon into the depths of the country occurred not according to someone's plan (no one even believed in such a possibility), but occurred as the result of the most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and desires of the people participating in the war, who did not perceive what was to happen and what would be the only salvation of Russia. It all occurs by chance. At the beginning of the campaign, the armies are cut in two. We attempt to unite them with the obvious goal of giving battle and holding up the enemy's advance, but in this attempt to unite, avoiding battles with the stronger enemy and involuntarily retreating at a sharp angle, we draw the enemy as far as Smolensk. But it is not enough to say that we retreat at a sharp angle, because the French are moving between the two armies—the angle becomes sharper still, and we pull further back, because Barclay de Tolly, an unpopular German,[214] is hateful to Bagration (who is to be under his leadership), and Bagration, commanding the second army, tries to take as long as possible to unite with Barclay and put himself under his command. Bagration does not unite with him for a long time (though the main goal of the entire leadership lies in this union), because it seems to him that in this march he is putting his army in danger and that the most advantageous thing for him will be to retreat more to the left and south, worrying the enemy from the flank and the rear, and filling out his army in the Ukraine. But it seems he has thought up this plan because he does not want to submit to the hateful and junior-ranking German Barclay.","The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes, among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy’s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an actute angle—we led the French on to Smolensk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration (who would come under his command), and Bagration—being in command of the second army—tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay’s command as long as he could. Bagration was slow in effecting the junction—though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters—because, as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior to his own."

"Русские не только не укрепляли позицию Бородинского поля влево под прямым углом от дороги (то есть места, на котором произошло сражение), но и никогда до 25-го августа 1812 года не думали о том, чтобы сражение могло произойти на этом месте. Этому служит доказательством, во-первых, то, что не только 25-го не было на этом месте укреплений, но что, начатые 25-го числа, они не были кончены и 26-го; во-вторых, доказательством служит положение Шевардинского редута: Шевардинский редут, впереди той позиции, на которой принято сражение, не имеет никакого смысла. Для чего был сильнее всех других пунктов укреплен этот редут? И для чего, защищая его 24-го числа до поздней ночи, были истощены все усилия и потеряно шесть тысяч человек? Для наблюдения за неприятелем достаточно было казачьего разъезда. В-третьих, доказательством того, что позиция, на которой произошло сражение, не была предвидена и что Шевардинский редут не был передовым пунктом этой позиции, служит то, что Барклай де Толли и Багратион до 25-го числа находились в убеждении, что Шевардинский редут есть левый фланг позиции и что сам Кутузов в донесении своем, писанном сгоряча после сражения, называет Шевардинский редут левым флангом позиции. Уже гораздо после, когда писались на просторе донесения о Бородинском сражении, было (вероятно, для оправдания ошибок главнокомандующего, имеющего быть непогрешимым) выдумано то несправедливое и странное показание, будто Шевардинский редут служил передовым постом (тогда как это был только укрепленный пункт левого фланга) и будто Бородинское сражение было принято нами на укрепленной и наперед избранной позиции, тогда как оно произошло на совершенно неожиданном и почти не укрепленном месте.","The Russians not only did not fortify the position of the Borodino field to the left at a right angle from the road (that is, the place where the battle took place), but never before August 25, 1812 did not think that the battle could take place on this place. This is evidenced, firstly, by the fact that not only on the 25th there were no fortifications in this place, but that, begun on the 25th, they were not completed on the 26th; secondly, the position of the Shevardinsky redoubt serves as proof: the Shevardinsky redoubt, in front of the position on which the battle was taken, does not make any sense. Why was this redoubt fortified stronger than all other points? And why, defending it on the 24th until late at night, were all efforts exhausted and six thousand people lost? To observe the enemy, a Cossack patrol was enough. Thirdly, the proof that the position on which the battle took place was not foreseen and that the Shevardinsky redoubt was not the forward point of this position is the fact that Barclay de Tolly and Bagration until the 25th were convinced that the Shevardinsky redoubt there is the left flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself, in his report, written in the heat of the moment after the battle, calls the Shevardinsky redoubt the left flank of the position. Much later, when reports about the battle of Borodino were written in the open, it was (probably to justify the mistakes of the commander in chief, who had to be infallible) that unfair and strange testimony was invented that the Shevardinsky redoubt served as an advanced post (whereas it was only a fortified point of the left flank) and as if the battle of Borodino was accepted by us in a fortified and pre-selected position, while it took place in a completely unexpected and almost unfortified place.","The Russians not only did not fortify the position on the field of Borodino to the left, at a right angle to the road (that is, the place where the battle was fought), but never thought, until the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, that the battle could be fought in that place. This is proved, first, by the fact that there not only were no fortifications in that place on the twenty-fifth, but that, having been begun on the twenty-fifth, they were not finished on the twenty-sixth; second, it is proved by the position of the Shevardino redoubt: the Shevardino redoubt, in front of the position on which battle was accepted, made no sense at all. Why was this redoubt fortified more than any other point? And why, in defending it until late at night on the twenty-fourth, were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men lost? A mounted Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. The third proof that the position on which the battle took place had not been foreseen and that the Shevardino redoubt was not an outpost of that position, is that until the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagra-tion were convinced that the Shevardino redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself, in his report written hot on the heels of the battle, called Shevardino the left flank of the position. Much later, when there was more leisure for writing reports about the battle of Borodino, the incorrect and strange testimony was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of the commander in chief, who must be infallible) that the Shevardino redoubt was supposedly an outpost (whereas it was only a fortified point on the left flank), and that the battle of Borodino was accepted by us at a fortified and previously chosen position, whereas it occurred in a completely unexpected and almost unfortified place.","Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the high road (that is, the position on which the battle took place) but never till the 25th of August 1812 did they think that a battle might be fought there. This is shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the 25th, and that those begun on the 25th and 26th were not completed, and secondly, by the position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the 24th? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevardino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the 25th Barclay de Tolly and Bagration were convinced that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself in his report written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander-in-chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post—whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank—and that the battle of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched."

"На обеде были Бессьер, Коленкур и Бертье. Наполеон встретил Балашева с веселым и ласковым видом. Не только не было в нем выражения застенчивости или упрека себе за утреннюю вспышку, но он, напротив, старался ободрить Балашева. Видно было, что уже давно для Наполеона в его убеждении не существовало возможности ошибок и что в его понятии все то, что он делал, было хорошо не потому, что оно сходилось с представлением того, что хорошо и дурно, но потому, что он делал это.","At dinner were Bessières, Caulaincourt and Berthier.

"Пчеловод открывает верхнюю колодезню и осматривает голову улья. Вместо сплошных рядов пчел, облепивших все промежутки сотов и греющих детву, он видит искусную, сложную работу сотов, но уже не в том виде девственности, в котором она бывала прежде. Все запущено и загажено. Грабительницы — черные пчелы — шныряют быстро и украдисто по работам; свои пчелы, ссохшиеся, короткие, вялые, как будто старые, медленно бродят, никому не мешая, ничего не желая и потеряв сознание жизни. Трутни, шершни, шмели, бабочки бестолково стучатся на лету о стенки улья. Кое-где между вощинами с мертвыми детьми и медом изредка слышится с разных сторон сердитое брюзжание; где-нибудь две пчелы, по старой привычке и памяти очищая гнездо улья, старательно, сверх сил, тащат прочь мертвую пчелу или шмеля, сами не зная, для чего они это делают. В другом углу другие две старые пчелы лениво дерутся, или чистятся, или кормят одна другую, сами не зная, враждебно или дружелюбно они это делают. В третьем месте толпа пчел, давя друг друга, нападает на какую-нибудь жертву и бьет и душит ее. И ослабевшая или убитая пчела медленно, легко, как пух, спадает сверху в кучу трупов. Пчеловод разворачивает две средние вощины, чтобы видеть гнездо. Вместо прежних сплошных черных кругов спинка с спинкой сидящих тысяч пчел и блюдущих высшие тайны родного дела, он видит сотни унылых, полуживых и заснувших остовов пчел. Они почти все умерли, сами не зная этого, сидя на святыне, которую они блюли и которой уже нет больше. От них пахнет гнилью и смертью. Только некоторые из них шевелятся, поднимаются, вяло летят и садятся на руку врагу, не в силах умереть, жаля его, — остальные, мертвые, как рыбья чешуя, легко сыплются вниз.

In some places, between the foundations with dead children and honey, an angry grumbling is occasionally heard from different directions; somewhere, two bees, out of old habit and memory, cleaning the nest of the hive, diligently, beyond their strength, drag away a dead bee or a bumblebee, without themselves knowing why they are doing it. In another corner, two other old bees are lazily fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, not knowing themselves whether they are hostile or friendly.

И люди этой партии доказывали, что все наше отступление до Дриссы было постыднейшее поражение и беспрерывный ряд ошибок. «Чем больше наделают ошибок, — говорили они, — тем лучше: по крайней мере, скорее поймут, что так не может идти. А нужен не какой-нибудь Барклай, а человек, как Бенигсен, который показал уже себя в 1807-м году, которому отдал справедливость сам Наполеон, и такой человек, за которым бы охотно признавали власть, — и таковой есть только один Бенигсен».","The sixth, the Bennigsenists, said, on the contrary, that after all there was no one more efficient and more experienced than Bennigsen, and no matter how you turn around, you will still come to him. And the people of this party argued that our entire retreat to Drissa was a shameful defeat and an uninterrupted series of mistakes. “The more mistakes they make,” they said, “the better: at least they will soon realize that this cannot go on. And what is needed is not some Barclay, but a man like Benigsen, who already showed himself in 1807, to whom Napoleon himself gave justice, and such a person who would be willingly recognized as the authority - and such is only one Benigsen.","The sixth, the Bennigsenists, said, on the contrary, that all the same there was no one more practical and experienced than Bennigsen, and that, however you twisted and turned, all the same you would come to him. And the people of this party kept maintaining that our whole withdrawal to the Drissa was a most disgraceful defeat and an unbroken series of errors. “The more errors they make the better,” they said, “at least they'll understand sooner that it can't go on like this. And what's needed is not some sort of Barclay, but a man like Bennigsen, who already showed himself in 1807, who was even given credit by Napoleon himself—a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and the only such man is Bennigsen.”","The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: ‘and twist about as you may you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!’ said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. ‘The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice— a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.’"

"— Да… я… я… я. Я желала его смерти. Да, я желала, чтобы скорее кончилось… Я хотела успокоиться… А что ж будет со мной? На что мне спокойствие, когда его не будет, — бормотала вслух княжна Марья, быстрыми шагами ходя по саду и руками давя грудь, из которой судорожно вырывались рыдания. Обойдя по саду круг, который привел ее опять к дому, она увидала идущих к ней навстречу m-lle Bourienne (которая оставалась в Богучарове и не хотела оттуда уехать) и незнакомого мужчину. Это был предводитель уезда, сам приехавший к княжне с тем, чтобы представить ей всю необходимость скорого отъезда. Княжна Марья слушала и не понимала его; она ввела его в дом, предложила ему завтракать и села с ним. Потом, извинившись перед предводителем, она подошла к двери старого князя. Доктор с встревоженным лицом вышел к ней и сказал, что нельзя.","“Yes…I…I…I.” I wished for his death. Yes, I wanted it to end soon... I wanted to calm down... But what will happen to me? Why do I need peace of mind when he’s gone, ”Princess Marya muttered aloud, walking quickly through the garden and pressing her hands on her chest, from which sobs burst convulsively. Walking around the circle in the garden, which led her back to the house, she saw m lle Bourienne (who remained in Bogucharovo and did not want to leave there) and an unfamiliar man walking towards her. It was the leader of the county, who himself came to the princess in order to present to her the need for an early departure. Princess Mary listened and did not understand him; she led him into the house, offered him breakfast, and sat down with him. Then, apologizing to the leader, she went to the door of the old prince. The doctor, with an alarmed face, came out to her and said that it was impossible.","“Yes ... I ... I ... I. I wished for his death. Yes, I wished it would end sooner ... I wanted to be at peace ... But what will become of me? What do I need peace for, if he won't be there?” Princess Marya murmured aloud, pacing the garden with quick steps, her arms pressed to her breast, from which sobs burst convulsively. Making a circle around the garden, which led her back to the house, she saw Mlle Bourienne coming towards her (she had stayed on at Bogucharovo and did not want to leave) and an unknown man with her. It was the marshal of the district nobility, who had come in person to the princess in order to present to her all the necessity of a speedy departure. Princess Marya listened and did not understand him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then, apologizing to the marshal, she went to the old prince's door. The doctor came out to her with an alarmed face and said she could not come in.","‘Yes … I … I … I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end quicker … I wished to be at peace … And what will become of me? What use will peace be when he is no longer here?’ Princess Marya murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs. When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne—who had remained at Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it—coming towards her with a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure. Princess Marya listened without understanding him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince’s room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter."

"Илья Андреич проглатывал слюни от удовольствия и толкал Пьера, но Пьеру захотелось также говорить. Он выдвинулся вперед, чувствуя себя одушевленным, сам не зная еще чем и сам не зная еще, что он скажет. Он только что открыл рот, чтобы говорить, как один сенатор, совершенно без зубов, с умным и сердитым лицом, стоявший близко от оратора, перебил Пьера.

"Разъезд французов был один из тех, которые были посланы по распоряжению Дюронеля по разным улицам Москвы для пресечения мародерства и в особенности для поимки поджигателей, которые, по общему, в тот день проявившемуся, мнению у французов высших чинов, были причиною пожаров.

"Действительно, только открытие кампании задержало Ростова и помешало ему приехать — как он обещал — и жениться на Соне. Отрадненская осень с охотой и зима со святками и с любовью Сони открыли ему перспективу тихих дворянских радостей и спокойствия, которых он не знал прежде и которые теперь манили его к себе. «Славная жена, дети, добрая стая гончих, лихие десять — двенадцать свор борзых, хозяйство, соседи, служба по выборам! — думал он.

"Офицеры поднялись. Князь Андрей вышел с ними за сарай, отдавая последние приказания адъютанту. Когда офицеры ушли, Пьер подошел к князю Андрею и только что хотел начать разговор, как по дороге недалеко от сарая застучали копыта трех лошадей, и, взглянув по этому направлению, князь Андрей узнал Вольцогена с Клаузевицем, сопутствуемых казаком. Они близко проехали, продолжая разговаривать, и Пьер с Андреем невольно услыхали следующие фразы:","The officers got up. Prince Andrei went with them outside the shed, giving his last orders to the adjutant.

"Князь Андрей считал неудобным писать к Курагину и вызывать его. Не подав нового повода к дуэли, князь Андрей считал вызов с своей стороны компрометирующим графиню Ростову, и потому он искал личной встречи с Курагиным, в которой он намерен был найти новый повод к дуэли. Но в Турецкой армии ему также не удалось встретить Курагина, который вскоре после приезда князя Андрея в Турецкую армию вернулся в Россию. В новой стране и в новых условиях жизни князю Андрею стало жить легче. После измены своей невесты, которая тем сильнее поразила его, чем старательнее он скрывал ото всех произведенное на него действие, для него были тяжелы те условия жизни, в которых он был счастлив, и еще тяжелее были свобода и независимость, которыми он так дорожил прежде. Он не только не думал тех прежних мыслей, которые в первый раз пришли ему, глядя на небо на Аустерлицком поле, которые он любил развивать с Пьером и которые наполняли его уединение в Богучарове, а потом в Швейцарии и Риме; но он даже боялся вспоминать об этих мыслях, раскрывавших бесконечные и светлые горизонты. Его интересовали теперь только самые ближайшие, не связанные с прежними, практические интересы, за которые он ухватывался с тем большей жадностью, чем закрытое были от него прежние. Как будто тот бесконечный удаляющийся свод неба, стоявший прежде над ним, вдруг превратился в низкий, определенный, давивший его свод, в котором все было ясно, но ничего не было вечного и таинственного.","Prince Andrei considered it inconvenient to write to Kuragin and summon him. Without giving a new reason for a duel, Prince Andrei considered the challenge on his part compromising Countess Rostov, and therefore he sought a personal meeting with Kuragin, in which he intended to find a new reason for a duel. But in the Turkish army, he also failed to meet Kuragin, who soon after the arrival of Prince Andrei in the Turkish army returned to Russia. In a new country and in new conditions of life, Prince Andrei began to live easier. After the betrayal of his bride, who struck him the more, the more diligently he concealed from everyone the effect made on him, those living conditions in which he was happy were difficult for him, and even more difficult were the freedom and independence that he so cherished before. He not only did not think about those former thoughts that first came to him, looking at the sky on the field of Austerlitz, which he liked to develop with Pierre and which filled his solitude in Bogucharov, and then in Switzerland and Rome; but he was even afraid to recall these thoughts, which opened up endless and bright horizons. He was now interested only in the most immediate, not connected with the former, practical interests, which he seized on with the greater greed, than the former ones were hidden from him. It was as if that endless receding vault of the sky that had previously stood above him suddenly turned into a low, definite vault that crushed him, in which everything was clear, but nothing was eternal and mysterious.","Prince Andrei considered it improper to write to Kuragin and challenge him.

In a new country and in new conditions, Prince Andrei's life became easier.

After his betrothed had broken faith with him—which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects—the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him.

"Ежели бы полководцы руководились разумными причинами, казалось, как ясно должно было быть для Наполеона, что, зайдя за две тысячи верст и принимая сражение с вероятной случайностью потери четверти армии, он шел на верную погибель; и столь же ясно бы должно было казаться Кутузову, что, принимая сражение и тоже рискуя потерять четверть армии, он наверное теряет Москву.

For Kutuzov it was mathematically clear, as it is clear that if I have less than one checker in checkers and I will change, I will probably lose and therefore should not change.","If the commanders had been guided by reasonable causes, it would seem it should have been quite clear to Napoleon that, having gone thirteen hundred miles and accepting battle with the likely chance of losing a quarter of his army, he was marching to certain destruction; and it should have been as clear to Kutuzov that, in accepting battle and also risking the loss of a quarter of his army, he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, as it is clear that, in a game of checkers, if I have one man less and keep trading man for man, I will certainly lose, and therefore I should not keep trading.","If the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should not exchange."
"На другой день он, с одною мыслию не жалеть себя и не отставать ни в чем от них, ходил с народом за Трехгорную заставу. Но когда он вернулся домой, убедившись, что Москву защищать не будут, он вдруг почувствовал, что то, что ему прежде представлялось только возможностью, теперь сделалось необходимостью и неизбежностью. Он должен был, скрывая свое имя, остаться в Москве, встретить Наполеона и убить его с тем, чтобы или погибнуть, или прекратить несчастье всей Европы, происходившее, по мнению Пьера, от одного Наполеона.","The next day, with one thought not to feel sorry for himself and not to lag behind them in anything, he went with the people beyond the Trekhgornaya outpost. But when he returned home, convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what had previously seemed to him only a possibility had now become a necessity and inevitability. He had to, hiding his name, stay in Moscow, meet Napoleon and kill him in order to either die or end the misfortune of all of Europe, which, according to Pierre, came from Napoleon alone.","The next day, with the one thought of not sparing himself and not lagging behind them in anything, he went out of the Three Hills gate with the people.

"Два одинаково сильные чувства неотразимо привлекали Пьера к его намерению. Первое было чувство потребности жертвы и страдания при сознании общего несчастия, то чувство, вследствие которого он 25-го поехал в Можайск и заехал в самый пыл сражения, теперь убежал из своего дома и, вместо привычной роскоши и удобств жизни, спал, не раздеваясь, на жестком диване и ел одну пищу с Герасимом; другое — было то неопределенное, исключительно русское чувство презрения ко всему условному, искусственному, человеческому, ко всему тому, что считается большинством людей высшим благом мира. В первый раз Пьер испытал это странное и обаятельное чувство в Слободском дворце, когда он вдруг почувствовал, что и богатство, и власть, и жизнь, все, что с таким старанием устроивают и берегут люди, — все это ежели и стоит чего-нибудь, то только по тому наслаждению, с которым все это можно бросить.","Two equally strong feelings irresistibly attracted Pierre to his intention.

"Первый начал говорить генерал Армфельд, неожиданно, во избежание представившегося затруднения, предложив совершенно новую, ничем (кроме как желанием показать, что он тоже может иметь мнение) не объяснимую позицию в стороне от Петербургской и Московской дорог, на которой, по его мнению, армия должна была, соединившись, ожидать неприятеля. Видно было, что этот план давно был составлен Армфельдом и что он теперь изложил его не столько с целью отвечать на предлагаемые вопросы, на которые план этот не отвечал, сколько с целью воспользоваться случаем высказать его. Это было одно из миллионов предположений, которые так же основательно, как и другие, можно было делать, не имея понятия о том, какой характер примет война.

В пространно составленной записке Толь предлагал другой — совершенно противный и плану Армфельда и плану Пфуля — план кампании. Паулучи, возражая Толю, предложил план движения вперед и атаки, которая одна, по его словам, могла вывести нас из неизвестности и западни, как он называл Дрисский лагерь, в которой мы находились. Пфуль во время этих споров и его переводчик Вольцоген (его мост в придворном отношении) молчали. Пфуль только презрительно фыркал и отворачивался, показывая, что он никогда не унизится до возражения против того вздора, который он теперь слышит. Но когда князь Волконский, руководивший прениями, вызвал его на изложение своего мнения, он только сказал:","The first to speak was General Armfeld, unexpectedly, in order to avoid the presenting embarrassment, by proposing a completely new, nothing (except to show that he, too, may have an opinion) inexplicable position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads, on which, in his opinion, the army should have united to wait for the enemy. It was evident that this plan had been drawn up long ago by Armfeld, and that he now presented it not so much with the aim of answering the proposed questions, to which this plan did not answer, but with the aim of taking the opportunity to express it. It was one of the millions of assumptions that could be made just as thoroughly as any other without having any idea of what kind of war would take. Some challenged his opinion, some defended it. The young Colonel Toll disputed the opinion of the Swedish general more than others, and during the argument he took out a written notebook from his side pocket, which he asked permission to read. In a lengthy note, Tol proposed a different plan of campaign, completely contrary to both Armfeld's plan and Pfuel's plan. Pauluchi, objecting to Tolya, proposed a plan for moving forward and attacking, which alone, according to him, could lead us out of the unknown and the trap, as he called the Dris camp in which we were. Pfuel during these disputes and his interpreter Wolzogen (his bridge in a courtly sense) were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away, showing that he would never stoop to object to the nonsense that he now hears. But when Prince Volkonsky, who was in charge of the debate, called him to present his opinion, he only said:","The first to begin speaking was General Armfelt, who, to get around the difficulty presented, unexpectedly suggested a new position, totally inexplicable (except by his wish to show that he, too, could have an opinion), away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads, at which, in his opinion, the united army should await the enemy. It was clear that this plan had been put together by Armfelt long ago, and he was now expounding it not so much with the purpose of answering the questions posed, which this plan did not answer, as with the purpose of using the opportunity to speak about it. It was one of the millions of suggestions that could be made, as well-founded as any other, if one had no notion of what character the war would take. Some argued against his opinion, some defended it. The young Colonel Toll argued against the Swedish general's opinion more vehemently than the others, and during the argument took from his side pocket a notebook full of writing, which he asked permission to read. In an extensively composed project, Toll suggested another plan of campaign—the complete opposite of Armfelt's plan and Pfuel's plan. Paulucci, objecting to Toll, suggested a plan of advance and attack, which alone, he said, could take us out of the uncertainty and the trap, as he called the Drissa camp, in which we found ourselves. During this argument, Pfuel and his translator Wolzogen (his bridge in court relations) were silent. Pfuel merely snorted scornfully and looked away, showing that he would never lower himself to objecting to the nonsense he was listening to. But when Prince Volkonsky, who was leading the debate, called on him to express his opinion, he merely said:","The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago, and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put—which in fact his plan did not answer—as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general ’s views more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook which he asked permission to read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from Armfeldt’s or Pfuel’s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated. During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter Wolzogen (his ‘bridge’ in court relations) were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when Prince Volkonsky, who was in the chair, called on him to give his opinion, he merely said:"

"У Яузского моста все еще теснилось войско. Было жарко. Кутузов, нахмуренный, унылый, сидел на лавке около моста и плетью играл по песку, когда с шумом подскакала к нему коляска. Человек в генеральском мундире, в шляпе с плюмажем, с бегающими не то гневными, не то испуганными глазами подошел к Кутузову и стал по-французски говорить ему что-то. Это был граф Растопчин.

Берг сидел подле графини и родственно-почтительно утешал ее.

"Каждому администратору в спокойное, не бурное время кажется, что только его усилиями движется все ему подведомственное народонаселение, и в этом сознании своей необходимости каждый администратор чувствует главную награду за свои труды и усилия. Понятно, что до тех пор, пока историческое море спокойно, правителю-администратору, с своей утлой лодочкой упирающемуся шестом в корабль народа и самому двигающемуся, должно казаться, что его усилиями двигается корабль, в который он упирается. Но стоит подняться буре, взволноваться морю и двинуться самому кораблю, и тогда уж заблуждение невозможно. Корабль идет своим громадным, независимым ходом, шест не достает до двинувшегося корабля, и правитель вдруг из положения властителя, источника силы, переходит в ничтожного, бесполезного и слабого человека.","In a calm, not stormy time, it seems to every administrator that only through his efforts all the population under his jurisdiction is moving, and in this consciousness of his necessity, each administrator feels the main reward for his labors and efforts. It is clear that as long as the historical sea is calm, it must seem to the ruler-administrator, with his fragile boat resting against the ship of the people with his pole and moving himself, that the ship against which he rests is moving with his efforts. But as soon as a storm rises, the sea is agitated and the ship itself moves, then delusion is impossible. The ship moves on its own huge, independent course, the pole does not reach the moving ship, and the ruler suddenly from the position of a ruler, a source of strength, passes into an insignificant, useless and weak person.","To every administrator, in peaceful, unstormy times, it seems that the entire population entrusted to him moves only by his efforts, and in this consciousness of his necessity every administrator finds the chief reward for his labors and efforts. It is understandable that, as long as the historical sea is calm, it must seem to the ruler-administrator in his frail little bark, resting his pole against the ship of the people and moving along with it, that his efforts are moving the ship. But once a storm arises, the sea churns up, and the ship begins to move by itself, and then the delusion is no longer possible. The ship follows its own enormous, independent course, the pole does not reach the moving ship, and the ruler suddenly, from his position of power, from being a source of strength, becomes an insignificant, useless, and feeble human being.","In quiet and troubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labour and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat-hook to the ship of the people, and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat-hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man."
"— Сейчас были, поехали сюда, — указывая вправо, отвечали ему.","“We were just now, let’s go here,” they answered him, pointing to the right.","“He was just here, he rode off that way,” they answered him, pointing to the right.","‘He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,’ someone told him, pointing to the right."
"«Да, мне открылась новое счастье, неотъемлемое от человека, — думал он, лежа в полутемной тихой избе и глядя вперед лихорадочно-раскрытыми, остановившимися глазами. Счастье, находящееся вне материальных сил, вне материальных внешних влияний на человека, счастье одной души, счастье любви! Понять его может всякий человек, но сознать и предписать его мог только один бог. Но как же бог предписал этот закон? Почему сын?.. И вдруг ход мыслей этих оборвался, и князь Андрей услыхал (не зная, в бреду или в действительности он слышит это), услыхал какой-то тихий, шепчущий голос, неумолкаемо в такт твердивший: „И пити-пити-питии“ потом „и ти-тии“ опять „и пити-пити-питии“ опять „и ти-ти“. Вместе с этим, под звук этой шепчущей музыки, князь Андрей чувствовал, что над лицом его, над самой серединой воздвигалось какое-то странное воздушное здание из тонких иголок или лучинок. Он чувствовал (хотя это и тяжело ему было), что ему надо было старательна держать равновесие, для того чтобы воздвигавшееся здание это не завалилось; но оно все-таки заваливалось и опять медленно воздвигалось при звуках равномерно шепчущей музыки. „Тянется! тянется! растягивается и все тянется“, — говорил себе князь Андрей. Вместе с прислушаньем к шепоту и с ощущением этого тянущегося и воздвигающегося здания из иголок князь Андрей видел урывками и красный, окруженный кругом свет свечки и слышал шуршанъе тараканов и шуршанье мухи, бившейся на подушку и на лицо его. И всякий раз, как муха прикасалась к его лицу, она производила жгучее ощущение; но вместе с тем его удивляло то, что, ударяясь в самую область воздвигавшегося на лице его здания, муха не разрушала его. Но, кроме этого, было еще одно важное. Это было белое у двери, это была статуя сфинкса, которая тоже давила его.","“Yes, a new happiness has opened up to me, inalienable from a person,” he thought, lying in a half-dark quiet hut and looking ahead with feverishly open, stopped eyes. Happiness that is outside of material forces, outside of material external influences on a person, the happiness of one soul, the happiness of love! Any person can understand it, but only one god could recognize and prescribe it. But how did God ordain this law? Why a son? .. And suddenly the train of these thoughts was interrupted, and Prince Andrei heard (not knowing whether he was delirious or really hears this), he heard some kind of quiet, whispering voice, incessantly repeating to the beat: “And drink, drink— drinking"" then ""and ti-ti"" again ""and piti-piti-drinking"" again ""and ti-ti"". At the same time, to the sound of this whispering music, Prince Andrei felt that over his face, over the very middle, some strange airy building was being erected from thin needles or splintered pieces. He felt (although it was hard for him) that he had to diligently keep his balance so that the building that was being erected would not collapse; but it still collapsed and again slowly rose to the sounds of evenly whispering music. ""It's pulling! stretches! stretches and everything stretches, ”Prince Andrei said to himself. Together with listening to the whisper and with the feeling of this stretching and rising building of needles, Prince Andrei saw in fits and starts the red light of a candle surrounded by a circle and heard the rustling of cockroaches and the rustling of a fly beating on the pillow and on his face. And every time a fly touched his face, it produced a burning sensation; but at the same time he was surprised that, hitting the very region of the building erected on his face, the fly did not destroy it. But besides that, there was one more important thing. It was white at the door, it was a statue of a sphinx that crushed him too.","“Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me, inalienable from man,” he thought, lying in the quiet, semi-dark cottage and looking straight ahead with a feverishly wide, fixed gaze. “A happiness that is beyond material forces, beyond external material influences on man, a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of love! Every person can understand it, but only God could conceive and prescribe it. But how did God prescribe this law? Why the Son? ...” And suddenly this course of thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrei heard (not knowing whether it was in delirium or in reality) some soft, whispering voice ceaselessly repeating in rhythm: “Piti-piti-piti” and then “ti-ti,” and again “piti-piti-piti” and again “ti-ti.” And at the same time, to the sound of this whispering music, Prince Andrei felt that above his face, above the very middle of it, a strange airy edifice of fine needles or splinters was being raised. He felt (though it was hard for him) that he had to try to keep his balance, so that this rising edifice would not collapse; but even so it kept collapsing and was raised again to the sounds of the measured, whispering music. “It stretches! stretches! stretches out, and keeps stretching!” Prince Andrei said to himself. While listening to the whisper and feeling this stretching edifice of needles being raised, Prince Andrei had glimpses of the red circle of light around the candle and heard the rustling of cockroaches and of the fly striking against the pillow and his face. And each time the fly touched his face, it made a burning sensation, and at the same time he was surprised that, hitting against the very area of his face where the edifice was being raised, the fly did not destroy it. But besides that, there was something else important. It was the white thing in the doorway, it was the statue of a sphinx, which also weighed on him.","‘Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived,’ he thought as he lay in the semi-darkness of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish, wide-open eyes. ‘A happiness lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act on man—a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son …?’ And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrei heard (without knowing whether it was delusion or reality) a soft, whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating ‘piti-piti-piti’, and then ‘ti-ti’, and then again ‘piti-piti-piti’, and ‘ti-ti’ once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult), so that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music—‘it stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,’ said Prince Andrei to himself. While listening to this whispering, and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of importance. It was something white by the door—the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him."
"Во время одного из таких перерывов Кутузов тяжело вздохнул, как бы сбираясь говорить. Все оглянулись на него.","During one of these breaks, Kutuzov sighed heavily, as if about to speak.

"Алпатыч, приехав в Богучарово несколько времени перед кончиной старого князя, заметил, что между народом происходило волнение и что, противно тому, что происходило в полосе Лысых Гор на шестидесятиверстном радиусе, где все крестьяне уходили (предоставляя казакам разорять свои деревни), в полосе степной, в богучаровской, крестьяне, как слышно было, имели сношения с французами, получали какие-то бумаги, ходившие между ними, и оставались на местах. Он знал через преданных ему дворовых людей, что ездивший на днях с казенной подводой мужик Карп, имевший большое влияние на мир, возвратился с известием, что казаки разоряют деревни, из которых выходят жители, но что французы их не трогают. Он знал, что другой мужик вчера привез даже из села Вислоухова — где стояли французы — бумагу от генерала французского, в которой жителям объявлялось, что им не будет сделано никакого вреда и за все, что у них возьмут, заплатят, если они останутся. В доказательство того мужик привез из Вислоухова сто рублей ассигнациями (он не знал, что они были фальшивые), выданные ему вперед за сено.","Alpatych, having arrived in Bogucharovo some time before the death of the old prince, noticed that there was unrest among the people and that, contrary to what was happening in the Bald Mountains on a sixty-verst radius, where all the peasants left (leaving the Cossacks to ruin their villages), in the steppe zone , in Bogucharovskaya, the peasants, as was heard, had relations with the French, received some papers that went between them, and remained in their places. He knew through the courtyard people devoted to him that the peasant Karp, who had recently traveled with a state-owned cart, and who had a great influence on the world, returned with the news that the Cossacks were devastating the villages from which the inhabitants came out, but that the French did not touch them. He knew that another muzhik had even brought yesterday from the village of Visloukhovo—where the French were stationed—a paper from the French general, in which the inhabitants were told that no harm would be done to them and that everything that was taken from them would be paid for if they stayed. As proof of this, the peasant brought from Visloukhov one hundred rubles in banknotes (he did not know that they were fake), given to him in advance for hay.","Alpatych, having come to Bogucharovo a short time before the old prince's passing, noticed that there was agitation among the people and that, contrary to what was happening in the region of Bald Hills, where over a forty-mile radius all the peasants were going away (leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks), in the steppe region of Bogucharovo the peasants, it was heard, had communications with the French, received some sort of leaflets that circulated among them, and were staying put. He knew through the domestic servants, who were devoted to him, that the muzhik Karp, who had great influence on the community, had made a trip in a government-owned cart the other day and come back with the news that the Cossacks devastated villages abandoned by their inhabitants, but that the French did not touch them. He knew that another muzhik, the evening before, had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo—where the French were camped—a leaflet from a French general, which announced to the inhabitants that no harm would be done them, and that whatever was taken from them would be paid for, if they stayed. As proof of it, the muzhik brought from Visloukhovo a hundred roubles in banknotes (not knowing they were counterfeit), which he had been paid in advance for hay.","Alpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old prince’s death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of sixty versts all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were, it was rumoured, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learnt from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm them. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that they were false) paid to him in advance for hay."

"Для тех людей, которые привыкли думать, что планы войн и сражений составляются полководцами таким же образом, как каждый из нас, сидя в своем кабинете над картой, делает соображения о том, как и как бы он распорядился в таком-то и таком-то сражении, представляются вопросы, почему Кутузов при отступлении не поступил так-то и так-то, почему он не занял позиции прежде Филей, почему он не отступил сразу на Калужскую дорогу, оставил Москву, и т. д. Люди, привыкшие так думать, забывают или не знают тех неизбежных условий, в которых всегда происходит деятельность всякого главнокомандующего. Деятельность полководца не имеет ни малейшего подобия с тою деятельностью, которую мы воображаем себе, сидя свободно в кабинете, разбирая какую-нибудь кампанию на карте с известным количеством войска, с той и с другой стороны, и в известной местности, и начиная наши соображения с какого-нибудь известного момента. Главнокомандующий никогда не бывает в тех условиях начала какого-нибудь события, в которых мы всегда рассматриваем событие. Главнокомандующий всегда находится в средине движущегося ряда событий, и так, что никогда, ни в какую минуту, он не бывает в состоянии обдумать все значение совершающегося события. Событие незаметно, мгновение за мгновением, вырезается в свое значение, и в каждый момент этого последовательного, непрерывного вырезывания события главнокомандующий находится в центре сложнейшей игры, интриг, забот, зависимости, власти, проектов, советов, угроз, обманов, находится постоянно в необходимости отвечать на бесчисленное количество предлагаемых ему, всегда противоречащих один другому, вопросов.","For those people who are used to thinking that plans for wars and battles are drawn up by generals in the same way that each of us, sitting in his office over a map, makes considerations about how and how he would dispose of such and such battle, questions arise why Kutuzov did not act in such and such a way during the retreat, why he did not take up a position before Filey, why he did not immediately retreat to the Kaluga road, left Moscow, etc. People who are used to thinking like that they forget or do not know those inevitable conditions in which the activity of any commander in chief always takes place. The activity of a general has not the slightest resemblance to the activity that we imagine sitting freely in an office, analyzing some campaign on the map with a known number of troops, on either side, and in a known area, and starting our considerations with some famous moment. The Commander-in-Chief is never in those conditions of the beginning of some event, in which we always consider the event. The Commander-in-Chief is always in the middle of a moving series of events, and in such a way that he is never, at any moment, in a position to consider the full significance of an ongoing event. The event is imperceptibly, moment by moment, cut into its meaning, and at every moment of this consistent, continuous cutting out of the event, the commander-in-chief is at the center of the most complex game, intrigues, worries, dependence, power, projects, advice, threats, deceptions, is constantly in the need to respond to the innumerable number of questions put to him, always contradicting one another.","For those people who are accustomed to think that the plans of wars and battles are drawn up by the commanders, just as each of us sitting in his study over a map makes reflections on how he would have disposed such and such battles, questions present themselves as to why Kutuzov, as he retreated, did not act thus and so, why did he not take up a position before Fili, why did he not retreat directly to the Kaluga road, why did he abandon Moscow, and so on. People who are accustomed to think that way forget or do not know those inevitable conditions in which the activity of every commander in chief always takes place. The activity of a commander does not have the slightest resemblance to the activity we imagine to ourselves, sitting at ease in our study, analyzing some campaign on a map with a known number of troops on one side and the other, and on known terrain, and beginning our reflections from some certain moment. A commander in chief is never in those conditions of the beginning of some event, in which we always consider events. A commander in chief always finds himself in the middle of a shifting series of events, and in such a way that he is never able at any moment to ponder all the meaning of the ongoing event. Imperceptibly, moment by moment, an event is carved into its meaning, and at every moment of this consistent, ceaseless carving of the event, a commander in chief finds himself in the center of a most complex play of intrigues, cares, dependency, power, projects, advice, threats, deceptions, finds himself constantly in the necessity of responding to the countless number of questions put to him, which always contradict each other.","For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals—as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle—the questions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fili? Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander-in-chief. The activity of a commander-in-chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment. A commander-in-chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event—the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander-in-chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event imperceptibly shapes itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping of events the commander-in-chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions, and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict with one another."

"Боссе, закрыв глаза и склонив голову, глубоко вздохнул, этим жестом показывая, как он умел ценить и понимать слова императора.","Bosse, closing his eyes and bowing his head, took a deep breath, with this gesture showing how he knew how to appreciate and understand the words of the emperor.","Beausset, closing his eyes and inclining his head, sighed deeply, showing thereby how he was able to appreciate and understand his emperor's words.","De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor’s words."
"— Эх, барышня! — говорил дворецкий. Но Наташа не сдалась, выкинула все вещи и быстро начала опять укладывать, решая, что плохие домашние ковры и лишнюю посуду не надо совсем брать. Когда всё было вынуто, начали опять укладывать. И действительно, выкинув почти все дешевое, то, что не стоило брать с собой, все ценное уложили в два ящика. Не закрывалась только крышка коверного ящика. Можно было вынуть немного вещей, но Наташа хотела настоять на своем. Она укладывала, перекладывала, нажимала, заставляла буфетчика и Петю, которого она увлекла за собой в дело укладыванья, нажимать крышку и сама делала отчаянные усилия.","- Oh, young lady! the butler said. But Natasha did not give up, threw out all the things and quickly began to pack again, deciding that bad home carpets and extra dishes should not be taken at all. When everything was taken out, they began to lay again. And indeed, throwing out almost everything cheap, what was not worth taking with you, everything of value was put into two boxes. Only the lid of the carpet box did not close. It was possible to take out a few things, but Natasha wanted to insist on her own. She packed, shifted, pressed, forced the barman and Petya, whom she dragged along into the business of packing, to press the lid and herself made desperate efforts.","“Eh, miss!” said the butler. But Natasha did not give in, threw all the things out, and quickly began repacking, deciding that the inferior domestic carpets and extra dishes should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out, they began packing again. And indeed, having discarded almost all the cheap things that were not worth taking along, they fitted all the costly things into two crates, Only the lid of the carpet crate would not close, A few things could have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on having her way. She packed and repacked, pressed down, made the pantryman and Petya, whom she drew into the business of packing, press down on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.","‘What a young lady she is!’ remarked the major-domo. But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler’s assistant and Petya—whom she had drawn into the business of packing—press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself."
"Офицер как будто смутился, как будто он понял, что можно думать о том, сколь многих не досчитаются завтра, но не следует говорить об этом.","The officer seemed to be embarrassed, as if he understood that one could think about how many people would be missing tomorrow, but one should not talk about it.","The officer seemed embarrassed, as if he realized that one might think of how many would be missing the next day, but one ought not to speak of it.","The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it."
"Пьер не знал того, что войска эти были поставлены не для защиты позиции, как думал Бенигсен, а были поставлены в скрытое место для засады, то есть для того, чтобы быть незамеченными и вдруг ударить на подвигавшегося неприятеля. Бенигсен не знал этого и передвинул войска вперед по особенным соображениям, не сказав об этом главнокомандующему.","Pierre did not know that these troops were not sent to defend the position, as Bennigsen thought, but were placed in a hidden place for an ambush, that is, in order to be unnoticed and suddenly strike at the advancing enemy. Bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward for special reasons, without telling the commander-in-chief about it.","Pierre did not know that these troops had been placed there not to defend the position, as Bennigsen thought, but had been put in a concealed spot for an ambush, that is, so as to remain unobserved and suddenly strike at the advancing enemy.

"— Eh bien, vous savez la grande nouvelle? Le prince Koutouzoff est marechal. [Ну-с, вы знаете великую новость? Кутузов — фельдмаршал. ] Все разногласия кончены. Я так счастлив, так рад! — говорил князь Василий. — Enfin voila un homme, [Наконец, вот это человек. ] — проговорил он, значительно и строго оглядывая всех находившихся в гостиной. L'homme de beaucoup de merite, несмотря на свое желание получить место, не мог удержаться, чтобы не напомнить князю Василью его прежнее суждение.

L'homme de beaucoup de merite, despite its desire to get a place, could not resist reminding Prince Vasily of his former judgment.

"«О, как тяжел этот неперестающий бред!» — подумал князь Андрей, стараясь изгнать это лицо из своего воображения. Но лицо это стояло пред ним с силою действительности, и лицо это приближалось. Князь Андрей хотел вернуться к прежнему миру чистой мысли, но он не мог, и бред втягивал его в свою область. Тихий шепчущий голос продолжал свой мерный лепет, что-то давило, тянулось, и странное лицо стояло перед ним. Князь Андрей собрал все свои силы, чтобы опомниться; он пошевелился, и вдруг в ушах его зазвенело, в глазах помутилось, и он, как человек, окунувшийся в воду, потерял сознание. Когда он очнулся, Наташа, та самая живая Наташа, которую изо всех людей в мире ему более всего хотелось любить той новой, чистой божеской любовью, которая была теперь открыта ему, стояла перед ним на коленях. Он понял, что это была живая, настоящая Наташа, и не удивился, но тихо обрадовался. Наташа, стоя на коленях, испуганно, но прикованно (она не могла двинуться) глядела на него, удерживая рыдания. Лицо ее было бледно и неподвижно. Только в нижней части его трепетало что-то.","“Oh, how heavy is this incessant nonsense!” thought Prince Andrei, trying to drive that face out of his imagination. But this face stood before him with the force of reality, and this face drew nearer. Prince Andrei wanted to return to the former world of pure thought, but he could not, and delirium drew him into his own realm. The low, whispering voice continued its measured babble, something pressed, pulled, and a strange face stood before him. Prince Andrei gathered all his strength to come to his senses; he stirred, and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, his eyes became dim, and he, like a man who has plunged into water, lost consciousness. When he woke up, Natasha, that very living Natasha, whom, of all the people in the world, he most of all wanted to love with that new, pure divine love that was now revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was a living, real Natasha, and was not surprised, but quietly delighted. Natasha, kneeling, frightened, but chained (she could not move), looked at him, holding back her sobs. Her face was pale and motionless. Only in the lower part of it something fluttered.","“Oh, how painful this constant delirium is!” thought Prince Andrei, trying to drive that face from his imagination.

"Перекатная пальба пушек и ружей усиливалась по всему полю, в особенности влево, там, где были флеши Багратиона, но из-за дыма выстрелов с того места, где был Пьер, нельзя было почти ничего видеть. Притом, наблюдения за тем, как бы семейным (отделенным от всех других) кружком людей, находившихся на батарее, поглощали все внимание Пьера.

"В первой говорилось о том, что слух, будто графом Растопчиным запрещен выезд из Москвы, — несправедлив и что, напротив, граф Растопчин рад, что из Москвы уезжают барыни и купеческие жены. «Меньше страху, меньше новостей, — говорилось в афише, — но я жизнью отвечаю, что злодей в Москве не будет». Эти слова в первый раз ясно показали Пьеру, что французы будут в Москве. Во второй афише говорилось, что главная квартира наша в Вязьме, что граф Витгснштейн победил французов, но что так как многие жители желают вооружиться, то для них есть приготовленное в арсенале оружие: сабли, пистолеты, ружья, которые жители могут получать по дешевой цене. Тон афиш был уже не такой шутливый, как в прежних чигиринских разговорах. Пьер задумался над этими афишами.

The second poster said that our main apartment is in Vyazma, that Count Wittgsstein defeated the French, but that since many residents want to arm themselves, there are weapons prepared in the arsenal for them: sabers, pistols, guns, which residents can get at a cheap price. The tone of the posters was no longer as playful as in Chigirin's previous conversations. Pierre thought about these posters. Obviously, that terrible thundercloud, which he called with all the forces of his soul and which at the same time aroused involuntary horror in him, - obviously, this cloud was approaching.","The first said that the rumor about Count Rastopchin forbidding people to leave Moscow was false and that, on the contrary, Count Rastopchin was glad that ladies and merchants' wives were leaving. “There will be less fear, less gossip,” said the poster, “but I answer with my life that the villain will never be in Moscow.” These words showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would be in Moscow.

"Крестьяне говорят, что поздней весной дует холодный ветер, потому что почка дуба развертывается, и действительно, всякую весну дует холодный ветер, когда развертывается дуб. Но хотя причина дующего при развертыванье дуба холодного ветра мне неизвестна, я не могу согласиться с крестьянами в том, что причина холодного ветра есть раэвертыванье почки дуба, потому только, что сила ветра находится вне влияний почки. Я вижу только совпадение тех условий, которые бывают во всяком жизненном явлении, и вижу, что, сколько бы и как бы подробно я ни наблюдал стрелку часов, клапан и колеса паровоза и почку дуба, я не узнаю причину благовеста, движения паровоза и весеннего ветра. Для этого я должен изменить совершенно свою точку наблюдения и изучать законы движения пара, колокола и ветра. То же должна сделать история. И попытки этого уже были сделаны.","The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oak bud unfolds, and indeed, every spring a cold wind blows when the oak unfolds.
