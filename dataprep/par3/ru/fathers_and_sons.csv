"– Я эфтим хочу доказать, милостивый государь (Павел Петрович, когда сердился, с намерением говорил: «эфтим» и «эфто», хотя очень хорошо знал, что подобных слов грамматика не допускает. В этой причуде сказывался остаток преданий Александровского времени. Тогдашние тузы в редких случаях, когда говорили на родном языке, употребляли одни – эфто, другие – эхто: мы, мол, коренные русаки, и в то же время мы вельможи, которым позволяется пренебрегать школьными правилами), я эфтим хочу доказать, что без чувства собственного достоинства, без уважения к самому себе, – а в аристократе эти чувства развиты, – нет никакого прочного основания общественному… bien public…[44] общественному зданию. Личность, милостивый государь, – вот главное; человеческая личность должна быть крепка, как скала, ибо на ней все строится. Я очень хорошо знаю, например, что вы изволите находить смешными мои привычки, мой туалет, мою опрятность, наконец, но это все проистекает из чувства самоуважения, из чувства долга, да-с, да-с, долга. Я живу в деревне, в глуши, но я не роняю себя, я уважаю в себе человека.","- I want to prove it, my dear sir (Pavel Petrovich, when he was angry, with the intention of saying: ""eftim"" and ""efto"", although he knew very well that grammar does not allow such words. in rare cases, when they spoke their native language, some people used - efto, others - ehto: we are, they say, indigenous hares, and at the same time we are nobles who are allowed to disregard school rules), I want to prove eftim that without a sense of our own dignity, without respect for oneself - and in the aristocrat these feelings are developed - there is no solid foundation for a public ... bien public ... [44] public building. Personality, my dear sir, is the main thing; the human personality must be strong as a rock, for everything is built on it. I know very well, for example, that you deign to find my habits, my toilet, my tidiness, at last, funny, but it all stems from a sense of self-respect, from a sense of duty, yes, yes, duty. I live in a village, in the wilderness, but I do not drop myself, I respect the person in myself.","""I am seeking to prove this,"" replied Paul Petrovitch. "" That without a certain sense of personal dignity, without a sense of self-respect (both of which senses are inborn in the true aristocrat), the social edifice, the bien public, cannot rest upon a durable basis. It is personality that matters, my dear sir: and the human personality requires to be as firm as a rock, in that there rests upon it the entire structure of society. For example, I know that you ridicule my customs, my dress, my fastidious tastes. Yet do those very things proceed from that sense of duty—yes, of duty, I repeat—to which I have just alluded. In other words, I may live in the depths of the country, yet I do not let myself go. For I respect in myself the man.""","'I am tryin' to prove by that, sir' (when Pavel Petrovitch was angry he intentionally clipped his words in this way, though, of course, he knew very well that such forms are not strictly grammatical. In this fashionable whim could be discerned a survival of the habits of the times of Alexander. The exquisites of those days, on the rare occasions when they spoke their own language, made use of such slipshod forms; as much as to say, 'We, of course, are born Russians, at the same time we are great swells, who are at liberty to neglect the rules of scholars'); 'I am tryin' to prove by that, sir, that without the sense of personal dignity, without self-respect—and these two sentiments are well developed in the aristocrat—there is no secure foundation for the social ... bien public ... the social fabric. Personal character, sir—that is the chief thing; a man's personal character must be firm as a rock, since everything is built on it. I am very well aware, for instance, that you are pleased to consider my habits, my dress, my refinements, in fact, ridiculous; but all that proceeds from a sense of self-respect, from a sense of duty—yes, indeed, of duty. I live in the country, in the wilds, but I will not lower myself. I respect the dignity of man in myself.'","‘By thert, my dear sir, I want to demonstrate,’ (Pavel Petrovich when he got angry deliberately mispronounced that in an affected way although he knew very well that proper usage didn’t admit it. This idiosyncrasy was the remnant of traditions going back to the time of Alexander I. The great men of the day, on the rare occasions when they spoke their mother tongue, would use such corruptions of language to show we are Russians through and through, at the same time we are noblemen who are licensed to ignore school rules) ‘ by thert I want to demonstrate that, without a sense of one’s own dignity, without self-respect – and in the aristocrat these feelings are highly developed – there is no solid foundation for the public… for the bien public,6 for the edifice of society. Character, my dear sir, is the key; man’s character must be firm as a rock, because on it everything is built. I know very well, for example, that you see fit to ridicule my habits, my clothes, even my personal fastidiousness – but all this comes from a sense of self-respect, from a sense of duty, yes, sir, yes, duty. I live in the country, in the back of beyond, but I don’t let myself go, I have respect for the human being I am.’"
"– Да так же. Например, я: я придерживаюсь отрицательного направления – в силу ощущения. Мне приятно отрицать, мой мозг так устроен – и баста! Отчего мне нравится химия?

"В то время в петербургском свете изредка появлялась женщина, которую не забыли до сих пор, княгиня Р. У ней был благовоспитанный и приличный, но глуповатый муж и не было детей. Она внезапно уезжала за границу, внезапно возвращалась в Россию, вообще вела странную жизнь. Она слыла за легкомысленную кокетку, с увлечением предавалась всякого рода удовольствиям, танцевала до упаду, хохотала и шутила с молодыми людьми, которых принимала перед обедом в полумраке гостиной, а по ночам плакала и молилась, не находила нигде покою и часто до самого утра металась по комнате, тоскливо ломая руки, или сидела, вся бледная и холодная, над Псалтырем. День наставал, и она снова превращалась в светскую даму, снова выезжала, смеялась, болтала и точно бросалась навстречу всему, что могло доставить ей малейшее развлечение. Она была удивительно сложена; ее коса золотого цвета и тяжелая, как золото, падала ниже колен, но красавицей ее никто бы не назвал; во всем ее лице только и было хорошего, что глаза, и даже не самые глаза – они были невелики и серы, – но взгляд их, быстрый и глубокий, беспечный до удали и задумчивый до уныния, – загадочный взгляд. Что-то необычайное светилось в нем, даже тогда, когда язык ее лепетал самые пустые речи. Одевалась она изысканно. Павел Петрович встретил ее на одном бале, протанцевал с ней мазурку, в течение которой она не сказала ни одного путного слова, и влюбился в нее страстно. Привыкший к победам, он и тут скоро достиг своей цели; но легкость торжества не охладила его. Напротив: он еще мучительнее, еще крепче привязался к этой женщине, в которой, даже тогда, когда она отдавалась безвозвратно, все еще как будто оставалось что-то заветное и недоступное, куда никто не мог проникнуть. Что гнездилось в этой душе – бог весть! Казалось, она находилась во власти каких-то тайных, для нее самой неведомых сил; они играли ею, как хотели; ее небольшой ум не мог сладить с их прихотью. Все ее поведение представляло ряд несообразностей; единственные письма, которые могли бы возбудить справедливые подозрения ее мужа, она написала к человеку почти ей чужому, а любовь ее отзывалась печалью: она уже не смеялась и не шутила с тем, кого избирала, и слушала его и глядела на него с недоумением. Иногда, большею частью внезапно, это недоумение переходило в холодный ужас; лицо ее принимало выражение мертвенное и дикое; она запиралась у себя в спальне, и горничная ее могла слышать, припав ухом к замку, ее глухие рыдания. Не раз, возвращаясь к себе домой после нежного свидания, Кирсанов чувствовал на сердце ту разрывающую и горькую досаду, которая поднимается в сердце после окончательной неудачи. «Чего же хочу я еще?» – спрашивал он себя, а сердце все ныло. Он однажды подарил ей кольцо с вырезанным на камне сфинксом.","At that time, a woman appeared occasionally in St. Petersburg society, who had not been forgotten until now, Princess R. She had a well-bred and decent, but stupid husband and had no children. She suddenly went abroad, suddenly returned to Russia, generally led a strange life. She was reputed for a frivolous coquette, enthusiastically indulged in all kinds of pleasures, danced until she fell, laughed and joked with young people whom she received before dinner in the semi-darkness of the living room, and at night she cried and prayed, did not find peace anywhere, and often rushed about until the morning. room, wringing her hands sadly, or sitting, all pale and cold, over the Psalter. Day was tempting, and she again turned into a lady of the world, rode out again, laughed, chatted and as if rushed towards everything that could give her the slightest amusement. She was amazingly built; her braid was golden in color and heavy as gold fell below her knees, but no one would call her a beauty; in her whole face there was nothing but good that her eyes, and not even the eyes themselves — they were small and gray — but their gaze, quick and deep, careless to the point of daring and pensive to the point of despondency, was a mysterious glance. Something extraordinary shone in him, even when her tongue babbled the most empty speeches. She dressed exquisitely. Pavel Petrovich met her at a ball, danced a mazurka with her, during which she did not say a single sensible word, and fell in love with her passionately. Accustomed to victories, he soon achieved his goal here too; but the lightness of the triumph did not cool him. On the contrary: he became even more painful, even more firmly attached to this woman, in whom, even when she surrendered herself irrevocably, as if there was still something cherished and inaccessible, where no one could penetrate. What was nesting in this soul - God knows! It seemed that she was in the grip of some secret, for her most unknown forces; they played it as they wanted; her little mind could not cope with their whims. All her behavior was a series of incongruities; The only letters that could arouse the just suspicions of her husband, she wrote to a man who was almost a stranger to her, and her love responded with sorrow: she no longer laughed and did not joke with the one whom she chose, but listened to him and looked at him with bewilderment. Sometimes, for the most part suddenly, this bewilderment turned into cold terror; her face took on an expression of death and wildness; she locked herself in her bedroom, and the maid could hear her, leaning her ear to the lock, her muffled sobs. More than once, returning to his home after a tender meeting, Kirsanov felt in his heart that tearing and bitter vexation that rises in his heart after a final failure. ""What more do I want?"" He asked himself, but his heart ached. He once gave her a ring with a sphinx carved into the stone.","""Among the society of St. Petersburg of that period there was accustomed to appear, and to disappear, at irregular intervals a certain Princess R. whose memory survives to this day. Though wedded to a highly placed and very presentable (albeit slightly stupid) husband, she had no children, and spent her time between making unexpected visits abroad and unexpected returns to Russia. In short, she led a very curious life, and the world in general accounted her a coquette, in that she devoted herself to every sort of pleasure, and danced at balls until she could dance no more, and laughed and jested with young men whom she received before dinner in the half-light of a darkened drawing-room. Yet, strangely enough, as the night advanced she would fall to weeping and praying and wringing her hands, and, unable to rest, would pace her room until break of day, or sit huddled, pale and cold, over the Psalter. But no sooner would daylight have appeared than she would once more become a woman of the world, and drive, and laugh, and chatter, and fling herself upon anything which seemed to offer any sort of distraction. Also, her power to charm was extraordinary; for though no one could have called her a beauty (seeing that the one good feature of her face lay in her eyes—and even then it was not the small, grey eyes themselves which attracted, but the glance which they emitted), she had hair of the colour and weight of gold which reached to her knees. That glance!—it was a glance which could be careless to the point of daring or meditative to the point of melancholy; a glance so enigmatical that, even when her tongue was lisping fatuous nonsense, there gleamed in her aspect something intangible and out of the common. Finally, she dressed with exquisite taste. ""This woman Paul Petrovitch met at a ball; and at it he danced a mazurka with her. Yet, though, during the dance, she uttered not a single word of sense, he straightway fell in love with her, and, being a man accustomed to conquests, attained his end in this case also. Yet, strangely enough, the facility of his triumph in no way chilled him, but led him on to become more and more resolutely, more and more painfully, attached, and that though she was a woman in whom, even after she had made the great surrender, there still remained something as immutably veiled, as radically intangible, as before—something which no one had yet succeeded in penetrating. What was in that soul God alone knows. Almost would it seem as though she were subservient to a mysterious force of which the existence was absolutely unknown to her, but which sported with her as it willed, and whose whims her mentality was powerless to control. At all events, her conduct constituted a series of inconsistencies, and even the few letters which she wrote to Paul Petrovitch—missives which would undoubtedly have aroused her husband's suspicions had he seen them—were written to a man who was practically a stranger to her. And in time her love began to be succeeded by fits of despondency; she ceased to smile and jest with the lover whom she had selected, and looked at him, and listened to his voice, with reluctance. In fact, there were moments—for the most part, unexpected moments—when this reluctance bordered upon chill horror, and her face assumed a wild, corpse-like expression, and she would shut herself up in her bedroom, whence her maid, with ear glued to the keyhole, would hear issue sounds as of dull, hopeless sobbing. Paul Petrovitch himself frequently found that, when returning home after one of these tender interviews, there was naught within his breast save the bitter, galling sensation which comes of final and irrevocable failure. ' What more could I want?' he would say to himself in his bewilderment; yet always he spoke with an aching heart. ""It happened that on one occasion he gave her a ring having a stone carved in the figure of the Sphinx.","At that time, there was sometimes seen in Petersburg society a woman who has even yet not been forgotten. Princess R——. She had a well-educated, well-bred, but rather stupid husband, and no children. She used suddenly to go abroad, and suddenly return to Russia, and led an eccentric life in general. She had the reputation of being a frivolous coquette, abandoned herself eagerly to every sort of pleasure, danced to exhaustion, laughed and jested with young men, whom she received in the dim light of her drawing-room before dinner; while at night she wept and prayed, found no peace in anything, and often paced her room till morning, wringing her hands in anguish, or sat, pale and chill, over a psalter. Day came, and she was transformed again into a grand lady; again she went out, laughed, chattered, and simply flung herself headlong into anything which could afford her the slightest distraction. She was marvellously well-proportioned, her hair coloured like gold and heavy as gold hung below her knees, but no one would have called her a beauty; in her whole face the only good point was her eyes, and even her eyes were not good—they were grey, and not large—but their glance was swift and deep, unconcerned to the point of audacity, and thoughtful to the point of melancholy—an enigmatic glance. There was a light of something extraordinary in them, even while her tongue was lisping the emptiest of inanities. She dressed with elaborate care. Pavel Petrovitch met her at a ball, danced a mazurka with her, in the course of which she did not utter a single rational word, and fell passionately in love with her. Being accustomed to make conquests, in this instance, too, he soon attained his object, but his easy success did not damp his ardour. On the contrary, he was in still more torturing, still closer bondage to this woman, in whom, even at the very moment when she surrendered herself utterly, there seemed always something still mysterious and unattainable, to which none could penetrate. What was hidden in that soul—God knows! It seemed as though she were in the power of mysterious forces, incomprehensible even to herself; they seemed to play on her at will; her intellect was not powerful enough to master their caprices. Her whole behaviour presented a series of inconsistencies; the only letters which could have awakened her husband's just suspicions, she wrote to a man who was almost a stranger to her, whilst her love had always an element of melancholy; with a man she had chosen as a lover, she ceased to laugh and to jest, she listened to him, and gazed at him with a look of bewilderment. Sometimes, for the most part suddenly, this bewilderment passed into chill horror; her face took a wild, death-like expression; she locked herself up in her bedroom, and her maid, putting her ear to the keyhole, could hear her smothered sobs. More than once, as he went home after a tender interview, Kirsanov felt within him that heartrending, bitter vexation which follows on a total failure. 'What more do I want?' he asked himself, while his heart was heavy. He once gave her a ring with a sphinx engraved on the stone.","At that time there occasionally used to appear in Petersburg society a woman who is remembered to this day, Princess R. She had a husband, well educated and respectable if a bit of a fool; they had no children. She would suddenly go off abroad and as suddenly come back to Russia; she generally led an odd life. She had the reputation of being a giddy flirt, gave herself enthusiastically to all kinds of pleasures, danced till she dropped, laughed and joked with the young men to whom she was at home before dinner in the dim light of her drawing room. But at night she would weep and pray – she could find no peace anywhere and often used to walk up and down her room till morning, wringing her hands in misery, or she would sit, all pale and chilled, over her prayer book. Day broke, and again she was transformed into the society lady, again she would go out, laugh, chatter and virtually throw herself at anything that could afford her the slightest distraction. Her body was amazing; her plait of hair, golden in colour and heavy as gold, fell below her knees; but no one would call her a beauty; her face’s only good feature was her eyes, and not really her actual eyes – which were small and grey – but their gaze, swift and deep, carefree to foolhardiness and pensive to desperation, their enigmatic gaze. Something unusual shone there even when her tongue was babbling the most vacuous of speeches. She dressed exquisitely. Pavel Petrovich met her at a ball, danced with her the whole mazurka, during which she uttered not a single word of sense, and fell passionately in love with her. Accustomed to conquests, here too he quickly achieved his goal; but the ease of his triumph did not cool his ardour. On the contrary: he became ever more painfully, ever more strongly attracted to this woman, who, even at the moment when she irrevocably surrendered herself, kept secret and inaccessible a place where none could penetrate. What lay enshrined in that soul – God knows! She seemed at the mercy of some secret powers, powers she herself was unaware of; they played with her as they chose; her small mind could not cope with their whims. Her whole behaviour displayed a series of contradictions; the only letters which could have aroused her husband’s justifiable suspicion she wrote to a man who was practically a stranger, and her love showed itself as melancholy; she didn’t really laugh and joke with the man she had chosen, whom she would listen to and watch with bewilderment. Sometimes, usually quite suddenly, that bewilderment became cold terror; her face assumed a deathly, wild expression; she would lock herself in her bedroom, and her maid, putting her ear to the keyhole, could hear her muffled sobs. Several times, returning home after a lovers’ meeting, Kirsanov felt in his heart that shattering and bitter disappointment that rises in the heart after a decisive failure. ‘What more do I want?’ he asked himself, but his heart went on aching. Once he gave her a ring with a sphinx engraved on its stone."
"До самого вечера и в течение всего следующего дня Василий Иванович придирался ко всем возможным предлогам, чтобы входить в комнату сына, и хотя он не только не упоминал об его ране, но даже старался говорить о самых посторонних предметах, однако он так настойчиво заглядывал ему в глаза и так тревожно наблюдал за ним, что Базаров потерял терпение и погрозился уехать. Василий Иванович дал ему слово не беспокоиться, тем более что и Арина Власьевна, от которой он, разумеется, все скрыл, начинала приставать к нему, зачем он не спит и что с ним такое подеялось? Целых два дня он крепился, хотя вид сына, на которого он все посматривал украдкой, ему очень не нравился… но на третий день за обедом не выдержал. Базаров сидел потупившись и не касался ни до одного блюда.","Until the very evening and throughout the next day, Vasily Ivanovich found fault with all possible excuses to enter his son's room, and although he not only did not mention his wound, but even tried to talk about the most extraneous subjects, he so persistently looked into him eyes and so anxiously watched him that Bazarov lost patience and threatened to leave. Vasily Ivanovich gave him his word not to worry, especially since Arina Vlasyevna, from whom he, of course, hid everything, began to pester him, why was he not sleeping and what had happened to him? For two whole days he strengthened himself, although the sight of his son, at whom he kept glancing furtively, he did not like very much ... but on the third day at dinner he could not stand it. Bazarov sat looking down and did not touch a single dish.","Then he left the room. Throughout that evening and the next few days Vasili Ivanitch kept making every possible excuse to enter his son's room; and though he never actually referred to the wound—he even strove to confine his conversation to purely extraneous subjects—his observation of his son remained so persistent, his solicitude so marked, that at length Bazarov, losing patience, bade him begone. Of course Vasili Ivanitch promised not to repeat the intrusion; and as a matter of fact he kept this promise the more religiously in that Arina Vlasievna (who had had the matter carefully concealed from her) was beginning to scent something in the wind, and to press for reasons why, during the previous night, her husband had never once closed his eyes. Accordingly, for the next two days Vasili Ivanitch faithfully observed the undertaking he had given; and that although the covert observation of his son's looks which he maintained showed them to be growing by no means to his liking: but on the third day, during dinner, Vasili Ivanitch could bear it no more, for Bazarov was sitting with his eyes lowered and his plate empty.","Up till late that evening, and all the following day, Vassily Ivanovitch kept catching at every possible excuse to go into his son's room; and though far from referring to the cut—he even tried to talk about the most irrelevant subjects —he looked so persistently into his face, and watched him in such trepidation, that Bazarov lost patience and threatened to go away. Vassily Ivanovitch gave him a promise not to bother him, the more readily as Arina Vlasyevna, from whom, of course, he kept it all secret, was beginning to worry him as to why he did not sleep, and what had come over him. For two whole days he held himself in, though he did not at all like the look of his son, whom he kept watching stealthily, ... but on the third day, at dinner, he could bear it no longer. Bazarov sat with downcast looks, and had not touched a single dish.","Till that evening and in the course of the next day Vasily Ivanovich picked on every excuse to go into his son’s room, and, though he not only didn’t mention his cut but even made an effort to speak about wholly extraneous subjects, he nonetheless looked so fixedly into his eyes and observed him so nervously that Bazarov lost patience and threatened to leave. Vasily Ivanovich gave him his word not to worry, especially since Arina Vlasyevna, from whom of course he concealed everything, was beginning to nag him why he wasn’t sleeping and what was the matter with him. He held out for two whole days although he very much didn’t like his son’s look – he watched him furtively all the time… but on the third day at dinner he couldn’t contain himself any more. Bazarov was sitting with his head slumped and hadn’t touched a single dish."

"За ужином разговаривали мало. Особенно Базаров почти ничего не говорил, но ел много. Николай Петрович рассказывал разные случаи из своей, как он выражался, фермерской жизни, толковал о предстоящих правительственных мерах, о комитетах, о депутатах, о необходимости заводить машины и т.д. Павел Петрович медленно похаживал взад и вперед по столовой (он никогда не ужинал), изредка отхлебывая из рюмки, наполненной красным вином, и еще реже произнося какое-нибудь замечание или, скорее, восклицание, вроде «а! эге! гм!». Аркадий сообщил несколько петербургских новостей, но он ощущал небольшую неловкость, ту неловкость, которая обыкновенно овладевает молодым человеком, когда он только что перестал быть ребенком и возвратился в место, где привыкли видеть и считать его ребенком. Он без нужды растягивал свою речь, избегал слова «папаша» и даже раз заменил его словом «отец», произнесенным, правда, сквозь зубы; с излишнею развязностью налил себе в стакан гораздо больше вина, чем самому хотелось, и выпил все вино. Прокофьич не спускал с него глаз и только губами пожевывал. После ужина все тотчас разошлись.","Little was said at supper. Especially Bazarov said almost nothing, but he ate a lot. Nikolai Petrovich told various incidents from his, as he put it, farming life, talked about the upcoming government measures, about committees, about deputies, about the need to start cars, etc. Pavel Petrovich slowly paced up and down the dining room (he never dined), occasionally sipping from a glass filled with red wine, and even less often uttering a remark or, rather, an exclamation, like “ah! ege! hm! "" Arkady reported several Petersburg news, but he felt a little awkward, that awkwardness that usually takes possession of a young man when he had just ceased to be a child and returned to the place where they were used to seeing and considering him a child. He unnecessarily stretched out his speech, avoided the word ""father"" and even once replaced it with the word ""father"", pronounced, however, through his teeth; with undue swagger, he poured into his glass much more wine than he himself would have liked, and drank all the wine. Prokofich did not take his eyes off him and only chewed with his lips. After supper they all dispersed at once.","At supper little was said. In particular did Bazarov scarcely speak, though he ate heartily; and only Nikolai Petrovitch proved garrulous as he related various incidents in what he termed his ""agricultural life,"" and gossiped of forthcoming administrative measures, committees, deputations, the need of introducing machinery, and other such topics. For his part, Paul Petrovitch paced the room (he never took supper), and sipped a glassful of red wine, and occasionally interjected some such remark—rather, exclamation—as ""Ah!"" or ""Oh, ho!"" or ""H'm!"" Arkady's contribution consisted of a little St. Petersburg gossip, even though, throughout, he was conscious of a touch of that awkwardness which overtakes a young man when, just ceased to be a boy, he returns to the spot where hitherto he has ranked as a mere child. In other words, he drawled his phrases unnecessarily, carefully avoided the use of the term ""Papasha,""[2] and, once, even went so far as to substitute for it the term ""Otety""[3]—though, true , he pronounced it with some difficulty. Lastly, in his excessive desire to seem at his ease, he helped himself to more wine than was good for him, and tasted some of every brand. Meanwhile Prokofitch chewed his lips, and never removed his eyes from his young master. Supper over, the company dispersed.","At supper there was little conversation.

"– Ага! родственное чувство заговорило, – спокойно промолвил Базаров. – Я заметил: оно очень упорно держится в людях. От всего готов отказаться человек, со всяким предрассудком расстанется; но сознаться, что, например, брат, который чужие платки крадет, вор, – это свыше его сил. Да и в самом деле: мой брат, мой – и не гений… возможно ли это?","- Aha! a kindred feeling spoke up, ”Bazarov said calmly. - I noticed: it is very stubborn in people.

And indeed: my brother, mine - and not a genius ... is it possible?","""Have done!"" shouted Arkady. ""Therein I detect the tie of blood,"" said Bazarov calmly. ""It is a very stubborn factor, I have noticed, in some people.

You see, the difficulty lies in the word 'my.' Is not that so?""","'Aha! family feeling spoke there,' Bazarov commented coolly. ' I've noticed how obstinately it sticks to people. A man's ready to give up everything and break with every prejudice; but to admit that his brother, for instance, who steals handkerchiefs, is a thief—that's too much for him. And when one comes to think of it: my brother, mine—and no genius ... that's an idea no one can swallow.'","‘Aha! Family feeling speaks,’ Bazarov said calmly. ‘I’ve noticed it’s very persistent in people. A man is ready to give up everything, to renounce every prejudice, but to admit, e.g., that his brother, who steals people’s handkerchiefs, is a thief – is quite beyond him. That’s what it is: my brother, mine – isn’t a genius. How can that be?’"

"Как ни владела собою Одинцова, как ни стояла выше всяких предрассудков, но и ей было неловко, когда она явилась в столовую к обеду. Впрочем, он прошел довольно благополучно. Порфирий Платоныч приехал, рассказал разные анекдоты; он только что вернулся из города. Между прочим, он сообщил, что губернатор, Бурдалу, приказал своим чиновникам по особым поручениям носить шпоры, на случай если он пошлет их куда-нибудь, для скорости, верхом. Аркадий вполголоса рассуждал с Катей и дипломатически прислуживался княжне. Базаров упорно и угрюмо молчал. Одинцова раза два – прямо, не украдкой – посмотрела на его лицо, строгое и желчное, с опущенными глазами, с отпечатком презрительной решимости в каждой черте, и подумала: «Нет… нет… нет…» После обеда она со всем обществом отправилась в сад и, видя, что Базаров желает заговорить с нею, сделала несколько шагов в сторону и остановилась. Он приблизился к ней, но и тут не поднял глаз и глухо промолвил:","No matter how self-controlled Odintsova was, no matter how she stood above all prejudices, she too was embarrassed when she appeared in the dining room for dinner. However, it went pretty well. Porfiry Platonitch came, told various anecdotes; he just got back from town. Incidentally, he reported that the governor, Burdalu, had ordered his special-duty officials to wear spurs in case he sent them somewhere, for speed, on horseback. Arkady talked in an undertone with Katya and diplomatically served the princess. Bazarov was stubborn and sullenly silent. Odintsova two times - directly, not furtively - looked at his face, stern and bilious, with downcast eyes, with an imprint of contemptuous determination in every line, and thought: ""No ... no ... no ..."" After dinner, she went to the garden with the whole company and, seeing that Bazarov wished to speak to her, she took a few steps aside and stopped. He approached her, but even then he did not raise his eyes and said in a dull voice:","In spite of her self-command, in spite of her superiority to convention, Madame Odintsov could not but feel a little uncomfortable when she entered the dining-room for the evening meal. Nevertheless the meal passed off without incident, and after it Porphyri Platonitch came in, and related various anecdotes on the strength of a recent visit to the neighbouring town—among other things, a story to the effect that Governor ""Bardeloue"" had commanded his whole staff of officials to wear spurs, in order that, if need be, he could dispatch them on their errands on horseback! Meanwhile, Arkady talked in an undertone to Katia, and also paid diplomatic attention to the Princess; while Bazarov maintained such an obstinate, gloomy silence that Madame, glancing at him (as she did twice, and openly, not covertly), thought to herself, as she scanned his stern, forbidding face, downcast eyes, and all-pervading expression of rigid contempt: ""No, no! Again, no!"" Dinner over, she conducted her guests into the garden, and, perceiving that Bazarov desired a word with her, walked aside a little, halted, and waited for him. Approaching with his eyes on the ground, he said in a dull way:","Great as was Madame Odintsov's self-control, and superior as she was to every kind of prejudice, she felt awkward when she went into the dining-room to dinner. The meal went off fairly successfully, however. Porfiry Platonovitch made his appearance and told various anecdotes; he had just come back from the town. Among other things, he informed them that the governor had ordered his secretaries on special commissions to wear spurs, in case he might send them off anywhere for greater speed on horseback. Arkady talked in an undertone to Katya, and diplomatically attended to the princess's wants. Bazarov maintained a grim and obstinate silence. Madame Odintsov looked at him twice, not stealthily, but straight in the face, which was bilious and forbidding, with downcast eyes, and contemptuous determination stamped on every feature, and thought: 'No ... no ... no.' ... After dinner, she went with the whole company into the garden, and seeing that Bazarov wanted to speak to her, she took a few steps to one side and stopped. He went up to her, but even then did not raise his eyes, and said hoarsely—","For all Anna Sergeyevna’s self-control, for all her being above prejudice, she still felt awkward when she came into the dining room for dinner.

Arkady had a discussion with Katya in a low voice and paid diplomatic court to the princess. Bazarov maintained a stubborn and gloomy silence.

If we have the chance to do something, well and good, but if we don’t, then we can be thankful we did without all the pointless chatter about it beforehand.’"

"На следующее утро Анна Сергеевна тотчас после завтрака отправилась ботанизировать с Базаровым и возвратилась перед самым обедом; Аркадий никуда не отлучался и провел около часа с Катей. Ему не было скучно с нею, она сама вызвалась повторить ему вчерашнюю сонату; но когда Одинцова возвратилась наконец, когда он увидал ее – сердце в нем мгновенно сжалось… Она шла по саду несколько усталою походкой; щеки ее алели, и глаза светились ярче обыкновенного под соломенною круглою шляпой. Она вертела в пальцах тонкий стебелек полевого цветка, легкая мантилья спустилась ей на локти, и широкие серые ленты шляпы прильнули к ее груди. Базаров шел сзади ее, самоуверенно и небрежно, как всегда, но выражение его лица, хотя веселое и даже ласковое, не понравилось Аркадию. Пробормотав сквозь зубы: «Здравствуй!» – Базаров отправился к себе в комнату, а Одинцова рассеянно пожала Аркадию руку и тоже прошла мимо его.","The next morning Anna Sergeevna immediately after breakfast went to botanize with Bazarov and returned just before dinner; Arkady did not leave anywhere and spent about an hour with Katya. He was not bored with her, she herself volunteered to repeat to him yesterday's sonata; but when Odintsova returned at last, when he saw her, his heart instantly sank ... She walked through the garden with a somewhat weary gait; her cheeks were red, and her eyes shone brighter than usual under a round straw hat. She twirled the thin stalk of a wildflower in her fingers, a light mantilla fell on her elbows, and the wide gray ribbons of her hat clung to her bosom. Bazarov walked behind her, self-confident and careless, as always, but the expression on his face, although cheerful and even affectionate, did not like Arkady. Muttering through clenched teeth: ""Hello!"" Bazarov went to his room, while Odintsova absentmindedly shook Arkady's hand and also walked past him.","When breakfast was over next morning, she set forth upon the botanising expedition with Bazarov; to return home just before luncheon time. Meanwhile Arkady did not leave the house, but spent an hour with Katia, nor found the time wearisome, seeing that of her own accord Katia volunteered to repeat the Sonata. Yet the instant that his eyes beheld Madame Odintsov returning his heart leapt within him. She was crossing the garden with a slightly tired step, but with her cheeks rosy of hue, her eyes shining under her round straw hat with even greater brilliancy than usual, and her fingers twirling between them the stalk of some field flower. Also, her light mantilla had slipped to her shoulders, and the broad ribands of her hat were floating over her bosom. Behind her walked Bazarov with his usual air of superciliousness and self-assurance, while on his face there was an expression cheerful, and even good-humoured. Yet somehow, Arkady did not like that expression. Muttering ""Good-morning,"" Bazarov passed towards his room, while Madame Odintsov accorded the young man a negligent handshake—then similarly continued her way.","The following morning Anna Sergyevna went off botanising with Bazarov directly after lunch, and returned just before dinner; Arkady did not go off anywhere, and spent about an hour with Katya. He was not bored with her; she offered of herself to repeat the sonata of the day before; but when Madame Odintsov came back at last, when he caught sight of her, he felt an instantaneous pang at his heart. She came through the garden with a rather tired step; her cheeks were glowing and her eyes shining more brightly than usual under her round straw hat. She was twirling in her fingers the thin stalk of a wildflower, a light mantle had slipped down to her elbows, and the wide gray ribbons of her hat were clinging to her bosom. Bazarov walked behind her, self-confident and careless as usual, but the expression of his face, cheerful and even friendly as it was, did not please Arkady. Muttering between his teeth, 'Good-morning!' Bazarov went away to his room, while Madame Odintsov shook Arkady's hand abstractedly, and also walked past him.","The next morning Anna Sergeyevna and Bazarov went off botanizing immediately after breakfast and returned just before dinner. Arkady didn’t go anywhere and spent an hour or so with Katya. He wasn’t bored with her, and she herself volunteered to play yesterday’s sonata again. But when Odintsova came back, his heart tightened for a moment… She walked through the garden with slightly weary steps, her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes shone more than usual from under her round straw hat. She was turning round in her fingers the stem of a wild flower, a light shawl had slipped down to her elbows, and the broad grey ribbons of her hat lay on her breast. Bazarov walked behind her confidently and easily, as usual, but Arkady didn’t like the expression on his face – though it was cheerful, even affectionate. Muttering ‘Good day!’ Bazarov went off to his room, and Anna Sergeyevna distractedly shook Arkady’s hand and also walked on past him."

"Катя повела Аркадия в сад. Встреча с нею показалась ему особенно счастливым предзнаменованием; он обрадовался ей, словно родной. Все так отлично устроилось: ни дворецкого, ни доклада.

"Слуга, из чувства приличия, а может быть, и не желая остаться под барским глазом, зашел под ворота и закурил трубку. Николай Петрович поник головой и начал глядеть на ветхие ступеньки крылечка: крупный пестрый цыпленок степенно расхаживал по ним, крепко стуча своими большими желтыми ногами; запачканная кошка недружелюбно посматривала на него, жеманно прикорнув на перила. Солнце пекло; из полутемных сеней постоялого дворика несло запахом теплого ржаного хлеба. Замечтался наш Николай Петрович. «Сын… кандидат… Аркаша…» – беспрестанно вертелось у него в голове; он пытался думать о чем-нибудь другом, и опять возвращались те же мысли. Вспомнилась ему покойница-жена… «Не дождалась!» – шепнул он уныло… Толстый сизый голубь прилетел на дорогу и поспешно отправился пить в лужицу возле колодца. Николай Петрович стал глядеть на него, а ухо его уже ловило стук приближающихся колес…","The servant, out of a sense of decency, and perhaps not wanting to remain under the master's eye, went under the gate and lit his pipe. Nikolai Petrovich bowed his head and began to gaze at the dilapidated steps of the porch: a large, variegated chicken was gradually paced along them, knocking hard with its large yellow legs; the soiled cat looked at him unfriendly, cuddly nestling on the railing. The sun was hot; the smell of warm rye bread smelled from the half-dark passage of the inn. Our Nikolai Petrovich was dreaming. ""Son ... candidate ... Arkasha ..."" - was constantly spinning in his head; he tried to think of something else, and again the same thoughts came back. He remembered his dead wife ... ""I didn't wait!"" - he whispered sadly ... A fat dove flew onto the road and hastily went to drink in a puddle near the well. Nikolai Petrovich began to look at him, and his ear was already catching the sound of approaching wheels ...","Presently either a sense of decency or (more probably) a certain disinclination to remain immediately under his master's eye led the servant to withdraw to the entrance gates, and there to light a pipe. Nikolai Petrovitch, however, continued sitting with head bent, and his eyes contemplating the ancient steps of the verandah, up which a stout speckled hen was tap-tapping its way on a pair of splayed yellow legs, and thereby causing an untidy, but fastidious-looking, cat to regard it from the balustrade with marked disapproval. Meanwhile the sun beat fiercely down, and from the darkened interior of a neighbouring granary came a smell as of hot rye straw. Nikolai Petrovitch sank into a reverie. ""My son Arkady a graduate!""—the words kept passing and repassing through his mind. Again and again he tried to think of something else, but always the same thought returned to him. Until eventually he reverted to the memory of his dead wife. ""Would that she were still with me!"" was his yearning reflection. Presently a fat blue pigeon alighted upon the roadway, and fell to taking a hasty drink from a pool beside the well. And almost at the instant that the spectacle of the bird caught Nikolai Petrovitch's eye, his ear caught the sound of approaching wheels.","The servant, from a feeling of propriety, and perhaps, too, not anxious to remain under the master's eye, had gone to the gate, and was smoking a pipe. Nikolai Petrovitch bent his head, and began staring at the crumbling steps; a big mottled fowl walked sedately towards him, treading firmly with its great yellow legs; a muddy cat gave him an unfriendly look, twisting herself coyly round the railing. The sun was scorching; from the half-dark passage of the posting station came an odour of hot rye-bread. Nikolai Petrovitch fell to dreaming. ' My son ... a graduate ... Arkasha ...' were the ideas that continually came round again and again in his head; he tried to think of something else, and again the same thoughts returned. He remembered his dead wife.... ' She did not live to see it!' he murmured sadly. A plump, dark-blue pigeon flew into the road, and hurriedly went to drink in a puddle near the well. Nikolai Petrovitch began looking at it, but his ear had already caught the sound of approaching wheels.","The manservant, out of a feeling of propriety but maybe also not wishing to remain under his master’s eye, went out through the gates and lit a pipe. Nikolay Petrovich bent his head and began to study the dilapidated steps of the porch.

A smell of warm rye bread came from the half-lit entrance of the little inn. Our Nikolay Petrovich fell into a reverie. ‘My son… a graduate… Arkasha…’ were the thoughts that went through his head.

Yet not for the sake of testing her, nor of seeing what might possibly come of it, had he mentioned his purposed departure (never at any time did he indulge in ""scheming""). Rather, the reason was that, earlier that morning, he had had an interview with his father's steward, Timotheitch, a rough, but quick-witted, old fellow who, in past days, had acted as his nurse, and had now presented himself—with tousled, flaxen hair, red, weather-beaten face, watery, sunken eyes, short, stout jacket of grey-blue cloth, leathern girdle, and tarred boots—at Nikolsköe.","One day walking in the garden with her, he suddenly announced, in a surly voice, that he intended going to his father's place very soon.... She turned white, as though something had given her a pang, and such a pang, that she wondered and pondered long after, what could be the meaning of it. Bazarov had spoken of his departure with no idea of putting her to the test, of seeing what would come of it; he never 'fabricated.' On the morning of that day he had an interview with his father's bailiff, who had taken care of him when he was a child, Timofeitch. This Timofeitch, a little old man of much experience and astuteness, with faded yellow hair, a weather-beaten red face, and tiny tear-drops in his shrunken eyes, unexpectedly appeared before Bazarov, in his shortish overcoat of stout greyish-blue cloth, girt with a strip of leather, and in tarred boots.","One day, as they were walking in the garden, he suddenly announced in a glum voice that he was going to leave and go to his father’s village… She went pale as if she’d been stabbed in the heart – so painfully that she was surprised and for a long time afterwards thought about what that might mean. Bazarov hadn’t made this announcement to test her and see what happened. He never played games. That morning he had seen Timofeich, his father’s bailiff who had looked after him as a child, a shrewd and agile old man with faded yellow hair, a weather-beaten red face and screwed-up, running eyes. Timofeich had unexpectedly appeared before Bazarov in his short jacket of thick grey-blue cloth, belted with a bit of strap, and tarred boots."

"«Зачем же он меня не спрашивает, почему я еду? и так же внезапно, как и он? – подумал Аркадий. – В самом деле, зачем я еду и зачем он едет?» – продолжал он свои размышления. Он не мог отвечать удовлетворительно на собственный вопрос, а сердце его наполнялось чем-то едким. Он чувствовал, что тяжело ему будет расстаться с этою жизнью, к которой он так привык; но и оставаться одному было как-то странно. «Что-то у них произошло, – рассуждал он сам с собою, – зачем же я буду торчать перед нею после отъезда? я ей окончательно надоем; я и последнее потеряю». Он начал представлять себе Анну Сергеевну, потом другие черты понемногу проступили сквозь красивый облик молодой вдовы.","“Why doesn't he ask me why I'm going? and as suddenly as he is? Thought Arkady. ""Indeed, why am I going and why is he going?"" - he continued his reflections. He could not answer his own question satisfactorily, and his heart was filled with something caustic. He felt that it would be difficult for him to part with this life to which he was so accustomed; but being alone was somehow strange. “Something happened to them,” he reasoned to himself, “why am I going to hang around in front of her after leaving? I'm finally tired of her; I’ll lose the last one too. ” He began to imagine Anna Sergeevna, then other features gradually emerged through the beautiful appearance of the young widow.","""Why does he not ask me the reason of my departure—a departure as sudden as his?"" reflected Arkady. ""Why is either of us departing, for that matter?"" As he continued to reflect he realised that, while unable to return a satisfactory answer to the question propounded, he seemed to have got a heartache somehow, to be feeling that he would find it hard to part with the life at Nikolsköe to which he was grown so accustomed. Yet he could not remain there alone. That would be worse still. ""Between him and her there is something in the wind,"" he reflected. ""That being so, what would my sticking here avail after he had gone? I should weary Anna Sergievna, and lose my last chance of pleasing her."" Then he began to draw a mental picture of the lady whom he had just named: until there cut across the fair presentment of the young widow another set of features.","'Why doesn't he ask me why I am going, and just as suddenly as he?' thought Arkady. ' In reality, why am I going, and why is he going?' he pursued his reflections. He could find no satisfactory answer to his own question, though his heart was filled with some bitter feeling. He felt it would be hard to part from this life to which he had grown so accustomed; but for him to remain alone would be rather odd. ' Something has passed between them,' he reasoned to himself; 'what good would it be for me to hang on after he's gone? She's utterly sick of me; I'm losing the last that remained to me.' He began to imagine Anna Sergyevna to himself, then other features gradually eclipsed the lovely image of the young widow.","‘Why doesn’t he ask me why I am going?’ Arkady thought. ‘And just as suddenly as he is. Really, why am I going, and why is he?’ he went on in his thoughts. He couldn’t find a satisfactory answer to his own question, and his heart was full of a kind of bitterness. He felt it would be difficult for him to leave this way of life to which he’d become so accustomed; but for him to stay on his own was a bit odd. ‘Something must have happened between them,’ he said to himself. ‘What’s the point of my hanging around her after he’s gone? I’ll really get on her nerves, and I’ll lose everything else.’ He began to visualize Anna Sergeyevna; then gradually another face eclipsed the beautiful features of the young widow."

"И он посмотрел кругом, как бы желая понять, как можно не сочувствовать природе. Уже вечерело; солнце скрылось за небольшую осиновую рощу, лежавшую в полверсте от сада: тень от нее без конца тянулась через неподвижные поля. Мужичок ехал рысцой на белой лошадке по темной узкой дорожке вдоль самой рощи: он весь был ясно виден, весь до заплаты на плече, даром что ехал в тени; приятно отчетливо мелькали ноги лошадки. Солнечные лучи с своей стороны забирались в рощу и, пробиваясь сквозь чащу, обливали стволы осин таким теплым светом, что они становились похожи на стволы сосен, а листва их почти синела и над нею поднималось бледно-голубое небо, чуть обрумяненное зарей. Ласточки летали высоко; ветер совсем замер; запоздалые пчелы лениво и сонливо жужжали в цветах сирени; мошки толклись столбом над одинокою, далеко протянутою веткою. «Как хорошо, боже мой!» – подумал Николай Петрович, и любимые стихи пришли было ему на уста; он вспомнил Аркадия, «Stoff und Kraft» – и умолк, но продолжал сидеть, продолжал предаваться горестной и отрадной игре одиноких дум. Он любил помечтать; деревенская жизнь развила в нем эту способность. Давно ли он так же мечтал, поджидая сына на постоялом дворике, а с тех пор уже произошла перемена, уже определились, тогда еще неясные, отношения… и как! Представилась ему опять покойница жена, но не такою, какою он ее знал в течение многих лет, не домовитою, доброю хозяйкою, а молодою девушкой с тонким станом, невинно-пытливым взглядом и туго закрученною косой над детскою шейкой. Вспомнил он, как он увидал ее в первый раз. Он был тогда еще студентом. Он встретил ее на лестнице квартиры, в которой он жил, и, нечаянно толкнув ее, обернулся, хотел извиниться и только мог пробормотать: «Pardon, monsieur»,[52] а она наклонила голову, усмехнулась и вдруг как будто испугалась и побежала, а на повороте лестницы быстро взглянула на него, приняла серьезный вид и покраснела. А потом первые робкие посещения, полуслова, полуулыбки, и недоумение, и грусть, и порывы, и, наконец, эта задыхающаяся радость… Куда это все умчалось? Она стала его женой, он был счастлив, как немногие на земле… «Но, – думал он, – те сладостные, первые мгновенья, отчего бы не жить им вечною, неумирающею жизнью?»","And he looked around, as if wishing to understand how it is possible not to sympathize with nature. It was already evening; the sun disappeared behind a small aspen grove that lay half a mile from the garden: its shadow stretched endlessly across the motionless fields. The peasant rode at a trot on a white horse along a dark narrow path along the grove itself: he was clearly visible, all the way up to the patch on his shoulder, even though he was riding in the shade; the horse's legs flashed pleasantly distinctly. The sun's rays, for their part, climbed into the grove and, making their way through the thicket, poured the trunks of the aspens with such a warm light that they became like the trunks of pine trees, and their foliage was almost blue, and a pale blue sky rose above it, slightly browned by the dawn. The swallows flew high; the wind has completely stopped; belated bees buzzed lazily and sleepily in the lilac flowers; midges pounded in a pillar over a lonely, far-out branch. ""How good, my God!"" Thought Nikolai Petrovich, and his favorite verses came to his lips; he remembered Arkady, ""Stoff und Kraft"" - and fell silent, but continued to sit, continued to indulge in the woeful and gratifying play of lonely thoughts. He loved to dream; village life developed this ability in him. How long has he dreamed the same way, waiting for his son at the inn, and since then there has already been a change, the relationship has already been decided, then still unclear ... and how! He again introduced himself to the deceased wife, but not as he had known her for many years, not as a homely, kind mistress, but as a young girl with a slender figure, an innocently inquiring look and a tightly twisted braid over a child's neck. He remembered the first time he saw her. He was still a student then. He met her on the stairs of the apartment in which he lived, and, accidentally pushing her, turned around, wanted to apologize and could only mutter: ""Pardon, monsieur,"" [52] and she bowed her head, grinned and suddenly seemed frightened and ran, and at the turn of the stairs she quickly looked at him, assumed a serious air and blushed. And then the first timid visits, half-words, half-smiles, and bewilderment, and sadness, and impulses, and, finally, this breathless joy ... Where did it all disappear? She became his wife, he was happy, like few on earth ... ""But, - he thought, - those sweet, first moments, why shouldn't he live an eternal, undying life?""","And he gazed around as though he were trying to understand how any one could be out of sympathy with the natural world. Evening was just closing in, and the sun sinking behind a small aspen copse which, situated half a verst from the garden, was trailing long shadows over the motionless fields. Along the narrow, dark track beside the copse a peasant on a white pony was trotting; and though the pair were overshadowed by the trees, the rider was as clearly visible, even to a patch on his shoulder, as the twinkling legs of his steed. Piercing the tangled aspens, the sun's beams were bathing the trunks in so brilliant a glow that trunks and beams were one bright mass, and only the foliage on the boughs above formed a dusky blur against the lighter tints of the flame-coloured sky. Overhead bats were whirling; the wind had sunk to rest; a few late-homing bees were buzzing somnolently, sluggishly amid the lilac blossoms; and a pillared swarm of gnats was dancing over a projecting bough. ""O God, how fair!"" was Nikolai's involuntary thought as his lips breathed a favourite couplet. Suddenly he remembered Arkady and Stoff und Kraft; and though he continued to sit where he was, he quoted poetry no more, but surrendered his mind wholly to the play of his lonely, irregular, mournful thoughts. At all times he was a man fond of dreaming; and to this tendency his life in the country had added confirmation. To think of what only a short while ago he had been dreaming as he waited for his son on the post-house verandah! For since that hour a change had come about, and in the vague relations between himself and his son there had dawned a more definite phase. Next, he saw before him his dead wife. Yet he saw her, not as she had appeared to him during the later years of her life— that is to say, as a kindly, thrifty châtelaine—but as a young girl slim of figure and innocently inquiring of eye. Yes, there flitted before his vision a picture only of neatly plaited tresses falling over a childish neck. And he thought of his first meeting with her when, as a student, he had encountered her on the staircase leading to his suite of rooms. He remembered how, having accidentally brushed against her, he had stopped to apologise, but had only succeeded in muttering ""Pardon, monsieur""; where-upon she had bowed, and smiled, and fled as in sudden alarm—but only to turn, the next moment, at the bend of the staircase, to look swiftly back, and then, as swiftly, to blush, and assume a more demure demeanour. Ah, those first timid meetings, those half-spoken words, those bashful smiles, those alternate fits of rapture and despair, that courtship that was destined to be crowned with swooning joy! Whither was it all fled? True, she had become his wife, and had conferred upon him such happiness as falls to the lot of few men on earth; but ever the thought recurred to him, and recurred again: ""Why could those days of sweetness not have lasted for ever, so that we might have lived a life which should never have known death?""","And he looked round, as though trying to understand how it was possible to have no feeling for nature. It was already evening; the sun was hidden behind a small copse of aspens which lay a quarter of a mile from the garden; its shadow stretched indefinitely across the still fields. A peasant on a white nag went at a trot along the dark, narrow path close beside the copse; his whole figure was clearly visible even to the patch on his shoulder, in spite of his being in the shade; the horse's hoofs flew along bravely. The sun's rays from the farther side fell full on the copse, and piercing through its thickets, threw such a warm light on the aspen trunks that they looked like pines, and their leaves were almost a dark blue, while above them rose a pale blue sky, faintly tinged by the glow of sunset. The swallows flew high; the wind had quite died away, belated bees hummed slowly and drowsily among the lilac blossom; a swarm of midges hung like a cloud over a solitary branch which stood out against the sky. ' How beautiful, my God!' thought Nikolai Petrovitch, and his favourite verses were almost on his lips; he remembered Arkady's Stoff und Kraft—and was silent, but still he sat there, still he gave himself up to the sorrowful consolation of solitary thought. He was fond of dreaming; his country life had developed the tendency in him. How short a time ago, he had been dreaming like this, waiting for his son at the posting station, and what a change already since that day; their relations that were then undefined, were defined now—and how defined! Again his dead wife came back to his imagination, but not as he had known her for many years, not as the good domestic housewife, but as a young girl with a slim figure, innocently inquiring eyes, and a tight twist of hair on her childish neck. He remembered how he had seen her for the first time. He was still a student then. He had met her on the staircase of his lodgings, and, jostling by accident against her, he tried to apologise, and could only mutter, 'Pardon, monsieur,' while she bowed, smiled, and suddenly seemed frightened, and ran away, though at the bend of the staircase she had glanced rapidly at him, assumed a serious air, and blushed. Afterwards, the first timid visits, the half-words, the half-smiles, and embarrassment; and melancholy, and yearnings, and at last that breathing rapture.... Where had it all vanished? She had been his wife, he had been happy as few on earth are happy.... ' But,' he mused, 'these sweet first moments, why could one not live an eternal, undying life in them?'","And he looked around him as if trying to understand how it was possible not to have a feeling for nature. Evening was now coming on. The sun had gone behind a small aspen wood which lay a quarter of a mile from his garden and cast its seemingly unending shadow over the motionless fields. A peasant was trotting on his white horse down a narrow, dark track which ran by the wood; although he was riding in shade, his whole figure was clearly visible down to a patch on his shoulder; his horse’s legs moved with a brisk regularity that was pleasing to the eye. For their part the sun’s rays went into the wood and, penetrating the undergrowth, bathed the trunks of the aspens in such a warm light that they looked like the trunks of fir trees; their foliage went almost dark blue while above them rose the azure sky tinged pink by the sunset. Swallows were flying high; the wind had dropped; lingering bees lazily, sleepily buzzed on the lilac blooms; a column of moths danced above a single protruding branch. ‘My God, how beautiful it is!’ thought Nikolay Petrovich, and some favourite lines of poetry were about to spring to his lips when he remembered Arkady and Stoff und Kraft and fell silent. He continued to sit there and continued to indulge in the pleasurable, melancholy sport of solitary reverie. He liked to dream – living in the country had developed that propensity in him. It was not so long ago that he was dreaming like this while waiting for his son at the inn, but since then a change had happened, relationships that weren’t quite clear had now been defined… so very clearly! He thought again of his dead wife, but not as he had known her for many years, a good and careful housewife, but as a girl with a slender waist, an innocently curious gaze and tightly plaited hair above a child’s neck. He remembered seeing her for the first time. He was then still a student. He met her on the stairs of the apartment where he was living. He bumped into her by accident, turned round to apologize and could only mumble ‘Pardon , monsieur’;1 she bowed her head, smiled and ran off as if she was frightened; then at the turn of the stairs, she gave him a quick look, put on a serious face and blushed. And then his first shy visits, the half words, half smiles, the doubts and sorrow and outbursts, and finally the breathless happiness… Where had all that gone? She became his wife, he was happy as few men on earth are… ‘ But why,’ he thought, ‘couldn’t those first sweet moments last for ever and never die?’"

Rather, comfort him as you would comfort a child, and also be kind to my mother. Two such mortals as them you will not find in all your great world—no, not though you search for them with a candle by daylight.... Russia needs me, indeed! Evidently she does not need me. Whom, then, does she need? She needs shoemakers, tailors, butchers.... What does a butcher sell? He sells meat, does he not?... I think that I am wandering—I seem to see before me a forest....""","'You will forget me,' he began again; 'the dead's no companion for the living.

People like them aren't to be found in your great world if you look by daylight with a candle.... I was needed by Russia.... No, it's clear, I wasn't needed. And who is needed?

There's a forest here ...'","‘You will forget me,’ he began again, ‘a dead man is no friend for the living. My father will say to you, what a man Russia is losing… That’s nonsense but don’t disillusion the old man. Anything to keep a child happy… you know. And be kind to my mother. You won’t find people like them in your big world even with a torch by daylight… Russia needs me… No, she clearly doesn’t. And who is needed? A cobbler is needed, a tailor is needed, a butcher… he sells meat… a butcher… Wait, I’m getting confused… There’s forest…’"

"– По-моему, – возразил Базаров, – Рафаэль гроша медного не стоит, да и они не лучше его.","“In my opinion,” objected Bazarov, “Raphael is not worth a dime, and they are no better than him.","""Like those artists,"" said Bazarov, ""I consider Raphael to be worth not a copper groat. And as for the artists themselves, I appraise them at about a similar sum.""","'To my mind,' retorted Bazarov, 'Raphael's not worth a brass farthing; and they're no better than he.'","‘I think,’ Bazarov objected, ‘that Raphael isn’t worth a brass farthing, and that they are no better than him.’"
"Базаров с Аркадием уехали на другой день. С утра уже все приуныло в доме; у Анфисушки посуда из рук валилась; даже Федька недоумевал и кончил тем, что снял сапоги. Василий Иванович суетился больше чем когда-либо: он видимо храбрился, громко говорил и стучал ногами, но лицо его осунулось, и взгляды постоянно скользили мимо сына. Арина Власьевна тихо плакала; она совсем бы растерялась и не совладела бы с собой, если бы муж рано утром целые два часа ее не уговаривал. Когда же Базаров, после неоднократных обещаний вернуться никак не позже месяца, вырвался наконец из удерживавших его объятий и сел в тарантас; когда лошади тронулись, и колокольчик зазвенел, и колеса завертелись, – и вот уже глядеть вслед было незачем, и пыль улеглась, и Тимофеич, весь сгорбленный и шатаясь на ходу, поплелся назад в свою каморку; когда старички остались одни в своем, тоже как будто внезапно съежившемся и подряхлевшем доме, – Василий Иванович, еще за несколько мгновений молодцевато махавший платком на крыльце, опустился на стул и уронил голову на грудь. «Бросил, бросил нас, – залепетал он, – бросил; скучно ему стало с нами. Один, как перст теперь, один!» – повторил он несколько раз и каждый раз выносил вперед свою руку с отделенным указательным пальцем. Тогда Арина Власьевна приблизилась к нему и, прислонив свою седую голову к его седой голове, сказала: «Что делать, Вася! Сын – отрезанный ломоть. Он, что сокол: захотел – прилетел, захотел – улетел; а мы с тобой, как опенки на дупле, сидим рядком и ни с места. Только я останусь для тебя навек неизменно, как и ты для меня».","Bazarov and Arkady left the next day. In the morning, everything in the house was already gloomy; Anfisushka's dishes were falling out of her hands; even Fedka was perplexed and ended up taking off his boots. Vasily Ivanovich fussed more than ever: he apparently was brave, spoke loudly and knocked his feet, but his face grew thin and his gazes constantly slipped past his son. Arina Vlasyevna was crying softly; she would have been completely at a loss and would not have mastered herself if her husband had not persuaded her for two whole hours early in the morning. When Bazarov, after repeated promises to return no later than a month, finally broke free from the embrace that held him and sat down in a tarantass; when the horses began to move, and the bell rang and the wheels spun, and now there was no need to look after them, and the dust had settled, and Timofeich, all hunched over and staggering as he walked, trudged back to his little room; when the old men were left alone in their house, which also seemed to be suddenly shrinking and decrepit, - Vasily Ivanovich, for a few moments more bravely waving his handkerchief on the porch, sank into a chair and dropped his head on his chest. “He threw it, threw us,” he muttered, “threw it; he became bored with us. One, like a finger now, one! "" - he repeated several times and each time brought forward his hand with a separated index finger. Then Arina Vlasyevna approached him and, leaning her gray head against his gray head, said: “What to do, Vasya! The son is a sliced hunk. He is like a falcon: he wanted - he flew, he wanted - he flew away; and you and I, like mushrooms in a tree trunk, are sitting side by side and not moving. Only I will remain unchanged for you forever, as you are for me. ""","Next day, therefore, Arkady and Bazarov departed. From earliest morn an air of woe pervaded the household. Anfisushka let fall some crockery, and Thedika's perturbation ended in his taking off his shoes. As for Vasili Ivanitch, he fussed about, and made a brave show—he talked in loud tones, and stamped his feet upon the floor as he walked; but his face had suddenly fallen in, and his glance could not meet that of his son. Meanwhile Arina Vlasievna indulged in quiet weeping. Indeed, but for the fact that her husband had spent two hours that morning in comforting her, she would have broken down completely, and lost all self-control. But at last, when, after reiterated promises to return within, at most, a month, Bazarov had freed himself from the arms which sought to detain him, and entered the tarantass; when the horses had started, and their collar-bow had begun to tinkle, and the wheels to revolve; when to gaze after the vehicle any longer had become useless, and the dust had subsided, and Timotheitch, bent and tottering, had crawled back into his pantry; when the old couple found themselves alone in a house which seemed suddenly to have grown as dishevelled and as decrepit as they—then, ah, then did Vasili Ivanitch desist from his brief show of waving his handkerchief in the verandah, and sink into a chair, and drop his head upon his breast. ""He has gone for ever, he has gone for ever,"" he muttered. "" He has gone because he found the life here tedious, and once more I am as lonely as the sand of the desert!"" These words he kept repeating again and again; and, each time that he did so, he raised his hand, and pointed into the distance. But presently Arina Vlasievna approached him, and, pressing her grey head to his, said: ""Never mind, my Vasia. True, our son has broken away from us; he is like a falcon —he has flown hither, he has flown thither, as he willed: but you and I, like lichen in a hollow tree, are still side by side, we are not parted.... And ever I shall be the same to you, as you will be the same to me.""","Bazarov and Arkady set off the next day. From early morning all was dejection in the house; Anfisushka let the tray slip out of her hands; even Fedka was bewildered, and was reduced to taking off his boots. Vassily Ivanitch was more fussy than ever; he was obviously trying to put a good face on it, talked loudly, and stamped with his feet, but his face looked haggard, and his eyes were continually avoiding his son. Arina Vlasyevna was crying quietly; she was utterly crushed, and could not have controlled herself at all if her husband had not spent two whole hours early in the morning exhorting her. When Bazarov, after repeated promises to come back certainly not later than in a month's time, tore himself at last from the embraces detaining him, and took his seat in the coach; when the horses had started, the bell was ringing, and the wheels were turning round, and when it was no longer any good to look after them, and the dust had settled, and Timofeitch, all bent and tottering as he walked, had crept back to his little room; when the old people were left alone in their little house, which seemed suddenly to have grown shrunken and decrepit too, Vassily Ivanovitch, after a few more moments of hearty waving of his handkerchief on the steps, sank into a chair, and his head dropped on to his breast. ' He has cast us off; he has forsaken us,' he faltered; 'forsaken us; he was dull with us. Alone, alone!' he repeated several times. Then Arina Vlasyevna went up to him, and, leaning her grey head against his grey head, said, 'There's no help for it, Vasya! A son is a separate piece cut off. He's like the falcon that flies home and flies away at his pleasure; while you and I are like funguses in the hollow of a tree, we sit side by side, and don't move from our place. Only I am left you unchanged for ever, as you for me.'","Bazarov and Arkady left the next day. From the morning on a gloom came over everyone. Anfisushka dropped dishes. Even Fedka was thrown by events and ended up by taking off his boots. Vasily Ivanovich fussed about more than ever. He was clearly trying to be brave, talking in a loud voice and stamping his feet, but he had a long face and kept avoiding his son’s eyes. Arina Vlasyevna cried gently. She would have completely gone to pieces and lost control if early in the morning her husband hadn’t lectured her for a whole two hours. When Bazarov, after repeated promises to come back no later than in a month’s time, finally tore himself from her clinging embraces and got into the tarantas; when the horses started and the harness bell rang and the wheels began to turn; when there was no longer any point in looking after them, and the dust had settled, and Timofeich had scuttled back into his little room, all hunched and stumbling as he went; when the old people were alone in their house which also seemed suddenly to have become shrunken and dilapidated – Vasily Ivanovich, who a few moments before had been bravely waving his handkerchief on the porch, fell into a chair and dropped his head. ‘He’s, he’s deserted us,’ he stammered, ‘deserted us. He got bored here with us. I’m all alone in the world, like this finger, all alone!’ he repeated several times and each time held out his hand in front of him, sticking out his index finger. Then Arina Vlasyevna came next to him and, laying her grey head by his, said, ‘What can we do, Vasya! Our son has left the nest. Like a falcon he came to us when he wanted to, and when he wanted to he flew off. And you and I sit side by side and can’t move, like mushrooms on a hollow tree. Only I’ll be your true one for ever and you’ll be mine.’"

After all, my brother jumps here!","He does not even understand himself.""

"Петр вернулся к коляске и вручил ему вместе с коробочкой толстую черную сигарку, которую Аркадий немедленно закурил, распространяя вокруг себя такой крепкий и кислый запах заматерелого табаку, что Николай Петрович, отроду не куривший, поневоле, хотя незаметно, чтобы не обидеть сына, отворачивал нос.","Pyotr returned to the carriage and handed him, along with the box, a thick black cigar, which Arkady immediately lit up, spreading such a strong and sour smell of hardened tobacco around him that Nikolai Petrovich, who had never smoked by birth, involuntarily, although imperceptibly, so as not to offend his son, turned his nose away ...","The result was that when Peter returned to the koliaska he handed Arkady not only the matchbox, but also a fat black cigar. This Arkady lit at leisure, and then proceeded to diffuse around him so strong and acrid an odour of tobacco that Nikolai Petrovitch (a non-smoker from birth) found himself forced to avert his nose (though he did this covertly, for fear of offending his son).","Piotr returned to the carriage, and handed him with the match-box a thick black cigar, which Arkady began to smoke promptly, diffusing about him such a strong and pungent odour of cheap tobacco, that Nikolai Petrovitch, who had never been a smoker from his youth up, was forced to turn away his head, as imperceptibly as he could for fear of wounding his son.","Pyotr came back to the carriage and handed him the box and a fat black cigar, which Arkady at once lit.

"Трудно передать словами, какою перепелкой влетел в комнату молодой прогрессист. Решившись, с свойственною ему назойливостью, поехать в деревню к женщине, которую он едва знал, которая никогда его не приглашала, но у которой, по собранным сведениям, гостили такие умные и близкие ему люди, он все-таки робел до мозга костей и, вместо того чтобы произнести заранее затверженные извинения и приветствия, пробормотал какую-то дрянь, что Евдоксия, дескать, Кукшина прислала его узнать о здоровье Анны Сергеевны и что Аркадий Николаевич тоже ему всегда отзывался с величайшею похвалой… На этом слове он запнулся и потерялся до того, что сел на собственную шляпу. Однако, так как никто его не прогнал и Анна Сергеевна даже представила его тетке и сестре, он скоро оправился и затрещал на славу. Появление пошлости бывает часто полезно в жизни: оно ослабляет слишком высоко настроенные струны, отрезвляет самоуверенные или самозабывчивые чувства, напоминая им свое близкое родство с ними. С прибытием Ситникова все стало как-то тупее – и проще; все даже поужинали плотней и разошлись спать получасом раньше обыкновенного.","It is difficult to convey in words what kind of quail the young progressist flew into the room with. Having decided, with his characteristic importunity, to go to the village to a woman whom he barely knew, who had never invited him, but with whom, according to the collected information, such clever and close people were staying, he was still shy to the marrow of his bones and, instead of uttering apologies and greetings in advance, he muttered some rubbish that Evdoksia, they say, Kukshina sent him to inquire about Anna Sergeevna's health and that Arkady Nikolayevich, too, always responded to him with the greatest praise ... At this word he stumbled and was lost before that sat on his own hat. However, since no one drove him away and Anna Sergeevna even introduced him to her aunt and sister, he soon recovered and began to crackle to glory. The appearance of vulgarity is often useful in life: it weakens strings that are too high-tuned, sobering self-confident or self-forgetful feelings, reminding them of their close relationship with them. With the arrival of Sitnikov, everything became somehow dumber — and simpler; everybody even had a better supper and went to bed half an hour earlier than usual.","To describe the craven fashion in which the young Progressive entered the room would be impossible. Although, with characteristic importunity, he had decided to repair to the residence of a lady with whom he was barely acquainted, and who had not accorded him an invitation (his pretext for such presumption being that, according to information received, she happened to be entertaining guests who were both intellectual and ""very intimate"" with himself), he had since felt his courage ebb to the marrow of his bones, and now, instead of proffering all the excuses and compliments which he had prepared in advance, blurted out some ridiculous story to the effect that Evdoksia Kukshin had sent him to inquire after the health of Anna Sergievna, and that Arkady Nikolaievitch had always spoken of him in terms of the highest respect. But at this point he began to stammer, and so lost his head as to sit down upon his own hat! No one bade him depart, however, and Anna Sergievna even went so far as to present him to her aunt and sister. Accordingly it was not long before he recovered his equanimity, and shone forth with his accustomed brilliancy. Often the appearance of the paltry represents a convenient phenomenon in life, since it relaxes over-taut strings, and sobers natures prone to conceit and self-assurance by reminding them of their kinship with the newcomer. Thus Sitnikov's arrival caused everything to become duller and a trifle more futile, but also rendered things simpler, and enabled the company to partake of supper with a better appetite, and to part for the night half an hour earlier than usual.","It is difficult to do justice in words to the strange figure cut by the young apostle of progress as he fluttered into the room. Though, with his characteristic impudence, he had made up his mind to go into the country to visit a woman whom he hardly knew, who had never invited him; but with whom, according to information he had gathered, such talented and intimate friends were staying, he was nevertheless trembling to the marrow of his bones; and instead of bringing out the apologies and compliments he had learned by heart beforehand, he muttered some absurdity about Evdoksya Kukshin having sent him to inquire after Anna Sergyevna's health, and Arkady Nikolaevitch's too, having always spoken to him in the highest terms.... At this point he faltered and lost his presence of mind so completely that he sat down on his own hat. However, since no one turned him out, and Anna Sergyevna even presented him to her aunt and her sister, he soon recovered himself and began to chatter volubly. The introduction of the commonplace is often an advantage in life; it relieves over-strained tension, and sobers too self-confident or self-sacrificing emotions by recalling its close kinship with them. With Sitnikov's appearance everything became somehow duller and simpler; they all even ate a more solid supper, and retired to bed half-an-hour earlier than usual.","It is difficult to find the words to describe the flying entrance of the young progressive. Having decided with his customary bravado to go to the country and visit a woman he barely knew, who had never invited him, but who according to his intelligence had staying with her these clever friends of his, he was scared witless all the same; instead of producing ready-prepared excuses and greetings, he mumbled out some rubbish about Yevdoksiya Kukshina having sent him to inquire about Anna Sergeyevna’s health, and also about Arkady Nikolayevich having always talked to him about her in such glowing terms… At this point he stumbled and got so confused that he sat down on his own hat. However, since no one showed him the door and since Anna Sergeyevna introduced him to her aunt and sister, he soon recovered himself and chattered away for all he was worth. The appearance of vulgarity often serves a purpose in life: it reduces the tension in strings that are drawn too tight and calms down feelings that are overly confident or forgetful, reminding them how closely related vulgarity is to them. With Sitnikov’s coming everything somehow became cruder – and simpler. Everyone even had more appetite for supper and went off to bed half an hour earlier than usual."

"– По непринужденности обращения, – заметил Аркадию Базаров, – и по игривости оборотов речи ты можешь судить, что мужики у моего отца не слишком притеснены.

Иная барышня только оттого и слывет умною, что умно вздыхает; а твоя за себя постоит, да и так постоит, что и тебя в руки заберет, – ну, да это так и следует. – Он захлопнул крышку и приподнялся с полу. – А теперь повторяю тебе на прощанье… потому что обманываться нечего: мы прощаемся навсегда, и ты сам это чувствуешь… ты поступил умно; для нашей горькой, терпкой, бобыльной жизни ты не создан. В тебе нет ни дерзости, ни злости, а есть молодая смелость да молодой задор; для нашего дела это не годится. Ваш брат дворянин дальше благородного смирения или благородного кипения дойти не может, а это пустяки. Вы, например, не деретесь – и уж воображаете себя молодцами, – а мы драться хотим. Да что! Наша пыль тебе глаза выест, наша грязь тебя замарает, да ты и не дорос до нас, ты невольно любуешься собою, тебе приятно самого себя бранить; а нам это скучно – нам других подавай! нам других ломать надо! Ты славный малый; но ты все-таки мякенький, либеральный барич – э волату, как выражается мой родитель.","- Eh, dear friend! - said Bazarov, - how do you put it! You see what I am doing: there is an empty space in the suitcase, and I am putting hay there; so it is in our life suitcase; whatever they stuffed it, as long as there is no emptiness. Do not be offended, please: you probably remember what I always thought of Katerina Sergeevna. A certain young lady is reputed to be clever only because she sighs cleverly; and yours will stand up for itself, and even so it will stand that it will take you into its hands - well, this is how it should be. He slammed the lid shut and lifted himself off the floor. - And now I repeat to you goodbye ... because there is nothing to be deceived: we say goodbye forever, and you yourself feel it ... you acted wisely; you are not created for our bitter, tart, booby life. In you there is neither insolence nor anger, but there is young courage and young enthusiasm; this is not good for our business. Your brother, a nobleman, cannot go beyond noble humility or noble boil, and this is nothing. You, for example, do not fight - and you already imagine yourself to be fine fellows - but we want to fight. What is it! Our dust will eat your eyes, our dirt will stain you, but you have not grown up to us, you involuntarily admire yourself, it is pleasant for you to scold yourself; but we are bored - give us others! we need to break others! You are a nice guy; but you are still a little, liberal barich - eh volatu, as my parent puts it.","For when you say 'It is an excellent course to take,' you dissemble, as well as waste your time, seeing that I am well aware of your views on marriage."" ""Merely my way of expressing myself. You see what I am doing at this moment. In my trunk is a vacant space. I am packing it with straw. And the same with life's trunk. To avoid leaving empty spaces therein we pad the interstices. You need not be offended. You cannot fail to remember what I really think of Katerina Sergievna. While some maidens earn cheap reputations by merely smiling at right moments, your inamorata can show more—indeed, so much more that soon you will be (and very properly) under her thumb."" Slapping down the lid of the trunk, Bazarov rose from the floor. ""Now, farewell,"" he said. ""No, I will not deceive you: we are parting for ever, and you know it. In my opinion you have acted wisely, for you were not meant to live the hard, bitter, reckless life of Nihilism—you lack at once the necessary coolness and the necessary venom. But this is not to say that in you there is not a due measure of youthful spirit. What I mean is that that asset alone is not sufficient for the work. The dvorianin is powerless to progress beyond either well-bred effervescence or well-bred humility: and both sentiments are futile. For example, you have not yet been blooded, yet already you think yourself a man: whereas the two chief conditions of our existence are battle and bloodshed. Yes, the dust from our heels hurts your eyes, and the grime on our bodies makes you feel dirty. In other words, although you derive a certain gratification from indulging in self-criticism, and think no small beer of yourself, you have failed to grow to our stature. To us such things are vanities. Tools' of an altogether different kind are what we need for the task. Consequently I repeat that, though a fine young fellow enough, you are also just a little-minded, so-called 'liberal-minded' baritch[1]—what my father calls a 'product of evolution.'""","'Ah, my dear fellow,' said Bazarov, 'how you talk! You see what I'm doing; there seems to be an empty space in the box, and I am putting hay in; that's how it is in the box of our life; we would stuff it up with anything rather than have a void. Don't be offended, please; you remember, no doubt, the opinion I have always had of Katerina Sergyevna. Many a young lady's called clever simply because she can sigh cleverly; but yours can hold her own, and, indeed, she'll hold it so well that she'll have you under her thumb—to be sure, though , that's quite as it ought to be.' He slammed the lid to, and got up from the floor. ' And now, I say again, good-bye, for it's useless to deceive ourselves—we are parting for good, and you know that yourself ... you have acted sensibly; you're not made for our bitter, rough, lonely existence. There's no dash, no hate in you, but you've the daring of youth and the fire of youth. Your sort, you gentry, can never get beyond refined submission or refined indignation, and that's no good. You won't fight—and yet you fancy yourselves gallant chaps— but we mean to fight. Oh well! Our dust would get into your eyes, our mud would bespatter you, but yet you're not up to our level , you're admiring yourselves unconsciously, you like to abuse yourselves; but we're sick of that—we want something else! we want to smash other people! You're a capital fellow; but you're a sugary, liberal snob for all that— ay volla-too, as my parent is fond of saying.'","‘Oh, my good friend!’ said Bazarov. ‘What a way of speaking! You see what I am doing – there’s some empty space left in my trunk, and I pack hay in there. So it is in our trunk of life: whatever we pack it with, don’t leave any empty space. Please don’t take offence. You probably don’t remember what was always my view of Katerina Sergeyevna. Some young ladies have the reputation of being intelligent because they sigh intelligently, but yours will stand up for herself, and in doing so she’ll take you in hand too – and that’s how it should be.’ He slammed shut the lid of the trunk and got up from the floor. ‘ And now in saying goodbye I’m going to say it again… because there’s no point in deceiving ourselves: we’re saying goodbye for good, and you sense that yourself… you have acted intelligently, you’re not made for this hard, bitter, solitary life of ours. You don’t have audacity or anger in you – you have the courage and the fervour of youth, but they’re not up to our task. You aristocratic lot can’t get beyond noble resignation or noble ardour – that’s just nonsense. You don’t fight, for example – and you think yourselves fine fellows – but we do want to fight. We will too! The dust we make will blind you, our dirt will soil you – we’ve grown up and you haven’t, you’re wrapped up in yourself without realizing it, you enjoy criticizing yourself – but we find that boring. Give us some others! We need others to bring down! You’re a nice fellow, but you’re still a soft little gentleman’s son – e volatu,1 as my good father says.’"
"– Нет! – говорил он на следующий день Аркадию, – уеду отсюда завтра. Скучно; работать хочется, а здесь нельзя. Отправлюсь опять к вам в деревню; я же там все свои препараты оставил. У вас, по крайней мере, запереться можно. А то здесь отец мне твердит: «Мой кабинет к твоим услугам – никто тебе мешать не будет»; а сам от меня ни на шаг. Да и совестно как-то от него запираться. Ну и мать тоже. Я слышу, как она вздыхает за стеной, а выйдешь к ней – и сказать ей нечего.","- Not! - he said the next day to Arkady, - I'll leave here tomorrow. Boring; I want to work, but here I can't. I will go back to your village again; I left all my preparations there. You, at least, can be locked up. And here my father keeps repeating to me: ""My office is at your service - no one will interfere with you""; and he himself is not a step away from me. And I am ashamed to somehow shut myself up from him. Well, mother too. I can hear her sighing behind the wall, and when you go out to her, she has nothing to say.","Next day he said to Arkady: ""To-morrow I must depart. The place wearies me, for I wish to work, and it is impossible to do so here. I will come to your place, I think, for all my chemical preparations are there. Moreover, one can at least lock one's door at your place; whereas here, though my father keeps saying, 'My study is entirely at your disposal, and no one shall disturb you,' he himself is never absent for a moment. And, for that matter, I should be ashamed to lock him outside, or my mother either. Sometimes I can hear her groaning in the next room. Yet no sooner do I go out to her than I find that I have not a word to say.""","'No!' he said to Arkady the next day. I'm off from here to-morrow. I'm bored; I want to work, but I can't work here. I will come to your place again; I've left all my apparatus there too. In your house one can at any rate shut oneself up. While here my father repeats to me, ""My study is at your disposal—nobody shall interfere with you,"" and all the time he himself is never a yard away. And I'm ashamed somehow to shut myself away from him. It's the same thing too with mother. I hear her sighing the other side of the wall, and if one goes in to her, one's nothing to say to her.'","Bazarov shrugged his shoulders. ‘No,’ he said the next day to Arkady, ‘I’m leaving here tomorrow. It’s so dull. I want to work but here I can’t. I’ll go again to your place. I’ve left all my experimental stuff there. At least in your house I can shut my door, whereas here my father keeps on saying to me, “My study is at your service – no one is going to bother you,” but he himself sticks to me like glue. And I feel a bit ashamed of shutting the door on him. My mother’s the same. I can hear her sighing on the other side of the wall, but if I go out to her, I haven’t anything to say to her.’"

"– Точно так-с; но я полагаю, что вы такого же мнения об аристократах, как и об аристократишках. Я считаю долгом объявить вам, что я этого мнения не разделяю. Смею сказать, меня все знают за человека либерального и любящего прогресс; но именно потому я уважаю аристократов – настоящих. Вспомните, милостивый государь (при этих словах Базаров поднял глаза на Павла Петровича), вспомните, милостивый государь, – повторил он с ожесточением, – английских аристократов.

Аристократия дала свободу Англии и поддерживает ее.","- Exactly so, sir; but I suppose you are of the same opinion of aristocrats as of aristocrats.

Remember, my dear sir (at these words Bazarov raised his eyes to Pavel Petrovich), remember, my dear sir, - he repeated with bitterness, - the English aristocrats.

Well, I may remark that your opinion is not mine. And to that I would add that, while I myself possess a reputation for Liberal and progressive views , I possess that reputation for the very reason that I can respect real aristocrats. For instance, my dear sir"" (the latter term was so heatedly uttered that Bazarov raised his eyebrows), ""for instance, my dear sir, take the aristocracy of England. While yielding upon their rights not an iota, they yet know how to respect the rights of others. While demanding fulfilment of obligations due to themselves, they yet fulfil their own obligations. And for those reasons it is to her aristocratic caste that England stands indebted for her freedom. It is because the English aristocratic caste itself supports that freedom.""","Precisely so; but I imagine you have the same opinion of aristocrats as of aristocratic snobs. I think it my duty to inform you that I do not share that opinion.

Kindly remember, sir' (at these words Bazarov lifted his eyes and looked at Pavel Petrovitch), 'kindly remember, sir,' he repeated, with acrimony—'the English aristocracy. They do not abate one iota of their rights, and for that reason they respect the rights of others; they demand the performance of what is due to them, and for that reason they perform their own duties. The aristocracy has given freedom to England, and maintains it for her.'","But I assume that you have the same opinion of aristocrats as you have of aristocratic trash.

"Так размышлял Аркадий… а пока он размышлял, весна брала свое. Все кругом золотисто зеленело, все широко и мягко волновалось и лоснилось под тихим дыханием теплого ветерка, все – деревья, кусты и травы; повсюду нескончаемыми звонкими струйками заливались жаворонки; чибисы то кричали, виясь над низменными лугами, то молча перебегали по кочкам; красиво чернея в нежной зелени еще низких яровых хлебов, гуляли грачи; они пропадали во ржи, уже слегка побелевшей, лишь изредка выказывались их головы в дымчатых ее волнах. Аркадий глядел, глядел, и, понемногу ослабевая, исчезали его размышления… Он сбросил с себя шинель и так весело, таким молоденьким мальчиком посмотрел на отца, что тот опять его обнял.","So Arkady pondered ... and while he pondered, spring took its toll. Everything around was golden green, everything was wide and softly agitated and shiny under the quiet breath of a warm breeze, everything — trees, bushes and grasses; larks poured in endless sonorous trickles everywhere; lapwings were shouting, hovering over the low-lying meadows, then silently running over the bumps; rooks walked beautifully in the tender green of the still low spring breads; they disappeared in the rye, already slightly white, only occasionally did their heads appear in its smoky waves. Arkady looked, looked, and, gradually weakening, his thoughts disappeared ... He threw off his greatcoat and looked at his father so cheerfully, as a young boy, that he hugged him again.","Thus Arkady. Yet, even as the thought passed through his mind, Spring seemed once more to regain possession of her kingdom, and everything around him grew golden-green, and trees, shrubs, and herbage started to wave and glimmer under the soft, warm breath of the vernal zephyrs, and larks took to pouring out their souls in endless, ringing strains, and siskins, circling high over sunken ponds, uttered their cry, then skimmed the hillocks in silence, and handsome black rooks stalked among the tender green of the short corn-shoots, or settled among the pale-white, smokelike ripples of the young rye, whence at intervals they protruded their heads. Arkady gazed and gazed; and gradually, as he did so, his late thoughts grew dimmer and disappeared, and, throwing off his travelling-cloak, he peered so joyously, with such a boyish air, into his father's face that Nikolai Petrovitch bestowed upon him yet another embrace.","Such were Arkady's reflections; ... but even as he reflected, the spring regained its sway. All around was golden green, all—trees, bushes, grass—shone and stirred gently in wide waves under the soft breath of the warm wind; from all sides flooded the endless trilling music of the larks; the peewits were calling as they hovered over the low-lying meadows, or noiselessly ran over the tussocks of grass; the rooks strutted among the half-grown short spring-corn, standing out black against its tender green; they disappeared in the already whitening rye, only from time to time their heads peeped out amid its grey waves. Arkady gazed and gazed, and his reflections grew slowly fainter and passed away.... He flung off his cloak and turned to his father, with a face so bright and boyish, that the latter gave him another hug.","Those were Arkady’s reflections… and while he was thinking, spring was coming into its own. Everything around was green and gold, everything gently and lavishly rippled and glistened in the quiet breath of a warm breeze, every single plant – trees, bushes and grass. Everywhere larks burst into an endless flow of song. Lapwings cried circling above the low-lying fields or silently ran through the tussocky grass. The cranes made beautiful specks of black as they walked through the tender green of the young spring corn. They disappeared in the rye, now just brushed with white, and from time to time only their heads showed above its rippling haze. Arkady looked and looked, and his thoughts gradually became feeble and vanished… He threw off his overcoat and looked at his father so cheerfully, so much like a little boy that Nikolay Petrovich again gave him a hug."

""Well, well!"" eventually said Bazarov. ""I have laid a hand upon the tow-rope, so it ill becomes me to complain of its weight. As we are here to inspect the local lions, let us inspect them."" To the young men the Governor accorded a civil enough welcome, but neither bade them be seated nor set the example himself. A man in a perpetual hurry and ferment, he, on rising in the morning, was accustomed to don a tight uniform and stiff collar, and then to give himself up to such an orgy of orders-giving that he never finished a single meal. As the result, he was known throughout the province as ""Bardeloue""—in reference, be it said, not to the great French preacher,[4] but to burda, fermented liquor. After inviting Arkady and Bazarov to the coming ball, the Governor, two minutes later, repeated the invitation as though he had never given it; while likewise he mistook the pair for brothers, and addressed them throughout as ""the Messieurs Kaiserov.""","He found Bazarov at the tavern where they were staying, and was a long while persuading him to go with him to the Governor's. ' Well, there's no help for it,' said Bazarov at last. ' It's no good doing things by halves. We came to look at the gentry; let's look at them!' The Governor received the young men affably, but he did not ask them to sit down, nor did he sit down himself. He was in an everlasting fuss and hurry; in the morning he used to put on a tight uniform and an excessively stiff cravat; he never ate or drank enough; he was for ever making arrangements. He invited Kirsanov and Bazarov to his ball, and within a few minutes invited them a second time, regarding them as brothers, and calling them Kisarov.","He found Bazarov at the inn where they were staying and spent a long time persuading him to go to the governor’s. ‘It can’t be helped,’ Bazarov said finally. ‘I’ve started something and I have to carry it through! We came to look at the gentry – so let’s do that!’ The governor received the young men affably but he didn’t ask them to sit down nor did he sit himself. He was always in a hurry and bustling about. In the morning he put on his close-fitting uniform and a very tightly tied cravat, he didn’t give himself time to finish food or drink, he was always ‘the man in charge’. In the province he had the nickname of Bourdaloue9 – the reference wasn’t to the famous French preacher but to burdá, hogwash. He invited Arkady and Bazarov to his ball and two minutes later invited them a second time, thinking now they were brothers and calling them Kaysarov."

"– То есть, говоря без аллегорий, к этой палке? – хладнокровно заметил Базаров. – Это совершенно справедливо. Вам нисколько не нужно оскорблять меня. Оно же и не совсем безопасно. Вы можете остаться джентльменом… Принимаю ваш вызов тоже по-джентльменски.","- That is, speaking without allegories, to this stick? Bazarov remarked coolly. - This is completely fair. You don't need to offend me in the least. It is also not entirely safe. You can remain a gentleman ... I accept your challenge in a gentlemanly way too.","""In other words, and speaking without metaphor, to that cane?"" said Bazarov in a tone of supreme indifference. ""Well, that is fair enough. Further insults are not needed—nor would you have found the offering of them altogether free from danger. Pray, therefore, remain a gentleman. It is as one that I accept your challenge.""","'That means, speaking without metaphor, to that stick?' Bazarov remarked coolly. ' That is precisely correct. It's quite unnecessary for you to insult me. Indeed, it would not be a perfectly safe proceeding. You can remain a gentleman.... I accept your challenge, too, like a gentleman.'","‘Meaning that cane, speaking bluntly?’ Bazarov said coolly. ‘ That’s quite fair. There’s absolutely no need for you to insult me. That wouldn’t be wholly free of risk. You can remain a gentleman… I accept your challenge too in a gentlemanly spirit.’"
"– Город как город, – хладнокровно заметил Базаров.","“A city is like a city,” remarked Bazarov coolly.","""The town is what a town always is,"" remarked Bazarov indifferently.","'The town's like every town,' Bazarov remarked coolly.","‘It’s just a town,’ said Bazarov coolly."
"– Да я полагаю, – ответил Базаров тоже со смехом, хотя ему вовсе не было весело и нисколько не хотелось смеяться, так же как и ей, – я полагаю, следует благословить молодых людей. Партия во всех отношениях хорошая; состояние у Кирсанова изрядное, он один сын у отца, да и отец добрый малый, прекословить не будет.","“Yes, I suppose,” Bazarov replied with a laugh, too, although he was not at all cheerful and did not want to laugh at all, just as she did. “I suppose the young people should be blessed. The party is good in all respects; Kirsanov has a fair fortune, he is one son of his father, and his father is a good fellow, he will not contradict.","""I presume""—he also was smiling, although he was feeling as wholly out of spirits, as little inclined towards gaiety, as she was—""I presume that we have no choice but to bestow our blessing upon the young couple. In every respect it would be a good match, for his father has a nice little property, Arkady is the only son, and the father is too easy-going to be likely to raise any difficulty.""","'Well, I suppose,' answered Bazarov, also with a laugh, though he felt anything but cheerful, and had no more inclination to laugh than she had; 'I suppose you ought to give the young people your blessing. It's a good match in every respect; Kirsanov's position is passable, he's the only son, and his father's a good-natured fellow, he won't try to thwart him.'","‘Well, I think,’ said Bazarov, also laughing, although he didn’t feel at all cheerful and, like her, didn’t feel like laughing at all, ‘I think one should give the young people a blessing. It’s a good match in every respect. Kirsanov is not badly off, he’s his father’s only son, and the father’s a good fellow, he won’t object.’"
"Места, по которым они проезжали, не могли назваться живописными. Поля, все поля тянулись вплоть до самого небосклона, то слегка вздымаясь, то опускаясь снова; кое-где виднелись небольшие леса и, усеянные редким и низким кустарником, вились овраги, напоминая глазу их собственное изображение на старинных планах екатерининского времени. Попадались и речки с обрытыми берегами, и крошечные пруды с худыми плотинами, и деревеньки с низкими избенками под темными, часто до половины разметанными крышами, и покривившиеся молотильные сарайчики с плетенными из хвороста стенами и зевающими воротищами[10] возле опустелых гумен, и церкви, то кирпичные с отвалившеюся кое-где штукатуркой, то деревянные с наклонившимися крестами и разоренными кладбищами. Сердце Аркадия понемногу сжималось. Как нарочно, мужички встречались все обтерханные, на плохих клячонках; как нищие в лохмотьях, стояли придорожные ракиты с ободранною корой и обломанными ветвями; исхудалые, шершавые, словно обглоданные, коровы жадно щипали траву по канавам. Казалось, они только что вырвались из чьих-то грозных, смертоносных когтей – и, вызванный жалким видом обессиленных животных, среди весеннего красного дня, вставал белый призрак безотрадной, бесконечной зимы с ее метелями, морозами и снегами… «Нет, – подумал Аркадий, – небогатый край этот, не поражает он ни довольством, ни трудолюбием; нельзя, нельзя ему так остаться, преобразования необходимы… но как их исполнить, как приступить?..»","The places they passed through could not be called picturesque. Fields, all fields stretched right up to the sky, now slightly rising, now falling again; here and there small forests could be seen and, dotted with rare and low bushes, ravines curled up, reminding the eye of their own image on the old plans of Catherine's time. There were rivers with open banks, and tiny ponds with thin dams, and villages with low huts under dark, often half-swept roofs, and crooked threshing sheds with wicker walls and yawning collars [10] near the empty gomen, and churches, now brick with plaster that has fallen off in some places, now wooden with leaning crosses and ruined cemeteries. Arkady's heart was squeezing a little. As if on purpose, the peasants met, all worn out, on bad nags; like beggars in rags stood the roadside rakitas with peeled bark and broken branches; emaciated, rough, as if gnawed, the cows greedily nibbled the grass in the ditches. It seemed that they had just escaped from someone's formidable, deadly claws - and, caused by the pitiful sight of exhausted animals, in the middle of a red spring day, a white ghost of a bleak, endless winter with its blizzards, frosts and snows arose ... “No,” thought Arkady, - this land is not rich, it does not amaze with either contentment or diligence; it is impossible, it is impossible for him to stay like that, transformations are necessary ... but how to execute them, how to start? .. ""","The scenery which the party were traversing could not have been called picturesque, for, with slight undulations, only fields, fields, and again fields, stretched to the very horizon. True, a few patches of copse were visible, but the ditches, with their borderings of low, sparse brushwood, recalled the antique land-measurement of Katherine's day. Also, streams ran pent between abruptly sloping banks, hamlets with dwarfed huts (of which the blackened roofs were, for the most part, cracked in half) stood cheek by jowl with crazy grinding-byres of plaited willow, empty threshing-floors had their gates sagging, and from churches of wood or of brick which stood amid dilapidated graveyards the stucco was peeling, and the crosses were threatening at any moment to fall. As he gazed at the scene Arkady's heart contracted. Moreover, the peasants encountered on the road looked ragged, and were riding sorry nags, while the laburnum trees which stood ranged like miserable beggars by the roadside had their bark hanging in strips, and their boughs shattered. Lastly, the lean, mud-encrusted cows which could be seen hungrily cropping the herbage in the ditches were so ""staring"" of coat that the animals might just have been rescued from the talons of some terrible, death-dealing monster; and as one gazed at those weak, pitiful beasts, almost one could fancy that one saw uprisen from amid the beauty of spring, the pale phantoms of Winter—its storms and its frost and its snow. ""Evidently this is not a rich district,"" reflected Arkady. "" Rather, it is a district which gives one the impression neither of abundance nor of hard work. Yet can it be left as it is? No! Education is what we need. But how is that education to be administered, or, for that matter, to be introduced?""","The country through which they were driving could not be called picturesque. Fields upon fields stretched all along to the very horizon, now sloping gently upwards, then dropping down again; in some places woods were to be seen, and winding ravines, planted with low, scanty bushes, recalling vividly the representation of them on the old-fashioned maps of the times of Catherine. They came upon little streams too with hollow banks; and tiny lakes with narrow dykes; and little villages, with low hovels under dark and often tumble-down roofs, and slanting barns with walls woven of brushwood and gaping doorways beside neglected threshing-floors; and churches, some brick-built, with stucco peeling off in patches, others wooden, with crosses fallen askew, and overgrown grave-yards. Slowly Arkady's heart sunk. To complete the picture, the peasants they met were all in tatters and on the sorriest little nags; the willows, with their trunks stripped of bark, and broken branches, stood like ragged beggars along the roadside; cows lean and shaggy and looking pinched up by hunger, were greedily tearing at the grass along the ditches. They looked as though they had just been snatched out of the murderous clutches of some threatening monster; and the piteous state of the weak, starved beasts in the midst of the lovely spring day, called up, like a white phantom, the endless, comfortless winter with its storms, and frosts, and snows.... ' No,' thought Arkady, 'this is not a rich country; it does not impress one by plenty or industry; it can't, it can't go on like this, reforms are absolutely necessary ... but how is one to carry them out, how is one to begin?'","The country through which they were driving could hardly be called picturesque. Fields, nothing but fields, rolled gently up and down, stretching to the horizon. Here and there they could see small woods and winding gullies, covered with sparse, low-growing bushes, which looked just the way they are shown on old maps from the time of Catherine the Great.7 They passed streams with crumbling banks and tiny ponds with broken dams. There were little villages of low huts beneath dark roofs, with thatch often half gone, and crooked threshing barns with walls of woven wattle and gaping doors, next to empty threshing floors. There were churches, brick ones with plaster peeling here and there, wooden ones with crosses askew and ruined cemeteries. Arkady’s heart slowly sank. As if it had been planned, all the peasants they passed were dressed in rags and riding wretched little horses. The willows by the road stood like tattered beggars, with torn bark and broken branches. Emaciated, rough-skinned cows, all bone, hungrily munched the grass in the ditches; they looked as if they’d just been torn from the murderous claws of some awesome beast. And on that beautiful spring day the pitiful sight of these exhausted animals called up the spectre of unending, cheerless winter with its blizzards and frosts and snow… ‘No,’ thought Arkady, ‘this country is poor, it doesn’t have either prosperity or industry. It mustn’t, mustn’t remain like this, changes are essential… but how are we to achieve them, where do we begin?…’"

"– Вы меня совершенно осчастливили, – промолвил он, не переставая улыбаться, – я должен вам сказать, что я… боготворю моего сына; о моей старухе я уже не говорю: известно – мать! Но я не смею при нем выказывать свои чувства, потому что он этого не любит. Он враг всех излияний; многие его даже осуждают за такую твердость его нрава и видят в ней признак гордости или бесчувствия; но подобных ему людей не приходится мерить обыкновенным аршином, не правда ли? Да вот, например: другой на его месте тянул бы да тянул с своих родителей; а у нас, поверите ли? он отроду лишней копейки не взял, ей-богу!","“You have made me completely happy,” he said, not ceasing to smile, “I must tell you that I… idolize my son; I'm not even talking about my old woman: you know - mother!

Well, for example: another in his place would have pulled and pulled from his parents; and with us, will you believe it? he didn’t take an extra penny from his life, by God!","""You have indeed cheered my heart!"" he exclaimed, still smiling. ""I simply idolise my son! But while my dear old wife is able to stand on rather a different footing with Evgenii—she is his mother, you know— I myself dare not express my whole feelings in his presence, for the reason that he dislikes such things, and is opposed to any manifestations of emotion. For the same reason some folk accuse him of hardness of heart and pride and insensibility; but men like Evgenii cannot be measured by ordinary standards, can they? For example, any one but he would have gone on acting as a drag upon his parents; but, would you believe it? never once since his birth has he asked us for a kopeck more than he absolutely needed! There, by God!""","You have made me perfectly happy,' he said, never ceasing to smile. ' I ought to tell you, I ... idolise my son; my old wife I won't speak of—we all know what mothers are!—but I dare not show my feelings before him, because he doesn't like it. He is averse to every kind of demonstration of feeling; many people even find fault with him for such firmness of character, and regard it as a proof of pride or lack of feeling, but men like him ought not to be judged by the common standard, ought they? And here, for example, many another fellow in his place would have been a constant drag on his parents; but he, would you believe it? has never from the day he was born taken a farthing more than he could help, that's God's truth!'","‘You have made me completely happy,’ he said, still smiling. ‘I must tell you that I… worship my son. I won’t mention my old lady – of course she has a mother’s feelings! But I don’t dare to speak out what I feel in front of him because he doesn’t like that. He is the enemy of all emotional talk. There are many who criticize him for hardness and see in that a sign of pride and insensitivity; but people like him can’t be measured by the normal rule, can they? For example, someone else in his situation would have gone on taking from his parents. But can you imagine, he hasn’t taken a spare penny from us in his life, as God’s my witness!’"

"Проводив Аркадия с насмешливым сожалением и дав ему понять, что он нисколько не обманывается насчет настоящей цели его поездки, Базаров уединился окончательно: на него нашла лихорадка работы. С Павлом Петровичем он уже не спорил, тем более что тот в его присутствии принимал чересчур аристократический вид и выражал свои мнения более звуками, чем словами. Только однажды Павел Петрович пустился было в состязание с нигилистом по поводу модного в то время вопроса о правах остзейских дворян,[135] но сам вдруг остановился, промолвив с холодною вежливостью:","After seeing Arkady off with mocking regret and letting him know that he was not in the least deceived about the real purpose of his trip, Bazarov retired completely: a fever of work found him. He no longer argued with Pavel Petrovich, especially since in his presence he assumed an overly aristocratic air and expressed his opinions more with sounds than words. Only once did Pavel Petrovich go into a contest with a nihilist over the then fashionable question of the rights of the Eastsee nobles, [135] but he suddenly stopped himself, saying with cold politeness:","After speeding Arkady on his way with satirical expressions of regret (as well as giving him to understand that the satirist laboured under no delusions as to the object of the young man's journey), Bazarov withdrew into complete seclusion, since a perfect fever for work had come upon him. Nor did he quarrel any longer with Paul Petrovitch, and the less so since the latter had now come to adopt an exclusively aristocratic attitude, and to express his sentiments only in monosyllables, not in words. Once, and once only, did he allow himself to engage in a controversy with Bazarov over the then current question of the rights of the dvoriané. But suddenly he checked himself, and said with an air of cold politeness:","Having seen Arkady off with ironical compassion, and given him to understand that he was not in the least deceived as to the real object of his journey, Bazarov shut himself up in complete solitude; he was overtaken by a fever for work. He did not dispute now with Pavel Petrovitch, especially as the latter assumed an excessively aristocratic demeanour in his presence, and expressed his opinions more in inarticulate sounds than in words. Only on one occasion Pavel Petrovitch fell into a controversy with the nihilist on the subject of the question then much discussed of the rights of the nobles of the Baltic province; but suddenly he stopped of his own accord, remarking with chilly politeness, 'However, we cannot understand one another; I, at least, have not the honour of understanding you.'","Bazarov saw Arkady off with a sarcastic expression of regret, letting him know that he wasn’t at all deceived about the true purpose of his trip. Bazarov then removed himself completely – he was overcome by a fever for work. He no longer argued with Pavel Petrovich, especially since the latter assumed in his presence an exaggeratedly aristocratic expression and gave vent to his opinions with sounds more than with words. Just once Pavel Petrovich was on the point of crossing swords with the ‘nihilist’ on the subject of the then fashionable question of the rights of the Baltic barons1 but he stopped himself, pronouncing with cool politeness:"

"Завтрак продолжался долго. За первою бутылкой шампанского последовала другая, третья и даже четвертая… Евдоксия болтала без умолку; Ситников ей вторил. Много толковали они о том, что такое брак – предрассудок или преступление, и какие родятся люди – одинаковые или нет? и в чем, собственно, состоит индивидуальность? Дело дошло наконец до того, что Евдоксия, вся красная от выпитого вина и стуча плоскими ногтями по клавишам расстроенного фортепьяно, принялась петь сиплым голосом сперва цыганские песни, потом романс Сеймур-Шиффа «Дремлет сонная Гранада», а Ситников повязал голову шарфом и представлял замиравшего любовника при словах:","The breakfast took a long time. The first bottle of champagne was followed by another, a third and even a fourth ... Eudoxia chatted incessantly; Sitnikov echoed her. They talked a lot about what marriage is - a prejudice or a crime, and what kind of people will be born - the same or not? and what exactly is individuality? It finally came to the point that Evdoksya, all red from drunk wine and banging with flat nails on the keys of an upset piano, began to sing in a hoarse voice, first gypsy songs, then Seymour-Schiff's romance ""Sleepy Granada Dormant"", and Sitnikov tied his head with a scarf and represented lover at the words:","The luncheon proved a lengthy affair, for to the first bottle of champagne there succeeded a second, and to the latter a third, and to that a fourth. Meanwhile Evdoksia kept up an unceasing flow of chatter, and received effective assistance from Sitnikov. In particular did the pair discuss the nature of marriage (""the outcome of prejudice and vice""), the question whether people are born ""single,"" and the consistency of ""individuality."" Then Evdoksia seated herself at the piano, and, red in the face with wine which she had drunk, clattered her flat finger-nails upon the keys, and essayed hoarsely to sing, first of all some gipsy ditties, and then the ballad, ""Dreaming Granada lies asleep""; while, throwing a scarf over his head to represent the dying lover, Sitnikov joined her at the words ""Your lips meet mine in a burning kiss.""","The lunch dragged on a long while. The first bottle of champagne was followed by another, a third, and even a fourth.... Evdoksya chattered without pause; Sitnikov seconded her. They had much discussion upon the question whether marriage was a prejudice or a crime, and whether men were born equal or not, and precisely what individuality consists in. Things came at last to Evdoksya, flushed from the wine she had drunk, tapping with her flat finger-tips on the keys of a discordant piano, and beginning to sing in a hoarse voice, first gipsy songs, and then Seymour Schiff's song, 'Granada lies slumbering'; while Sitnikov tied a scarf round his head, and represented the dying lover at the words—","Lunch went on for a long time. The first bottle of champagne was followed by a second, a third and even a fourth… Yevdoksiya spouted without drawing breath. Sitnikov kept up with her. They talked a lot: is marriage a prejudice or a crime; are all people born the same, or not; what exactly is personality. It all ended with Yevdoksiya, red in the face from the wine she had drunk, striking the keys of an out-of-tune piano with her stumpy nails. She started singing in a hoarse voice, first gipsy songs, then Seymour Schiff’s romance ‘Drowsy Granada slumbers’.15 And Sitnikov wrapped a scarf round his head and acted the dumbstruck lover as she sang:"

But, in such a case, what is one to do? Evidently the younger generation know more than we do.""","'Yes,' he said, without looking at any one; 'it's a misfortune to live five years in the country like this, far from mighty intellects!

"До завтрака оставалось около часа; росистое утро уже сменялось горячим днем. Лицо Аркадия сохраняло вчерашнее выражение, Катя имела вид озабоченный. Сестра ее тотчас после чаю позвала ее к себе в кабинет и, предварительно приласкав ее, что всегда немного пугало Катю, посоветовала ей быть осторожней в своем поведении с Аркадием, а особенно избегать уединенных бесед с ним, будто бы замеченных и теткой, и всем домом. Кроме того, уже накануне вечером Анна Сергеевна была не в духе; да и сама Катя чувствовала смущение, точно сознавала вину за собою. Уступая просьбе Аркадия, она себе сказала, что это в последний раз.","There was about an hour before breakfast; the dewy morning was already giving way to a hot day. Arkady's face retained the expression of yesterday, Katya looked preoccupied. Her sister immediately after tea called her into her study and, after caressing her, which always frightened Katya a little, advised her to be more careful in her behavior with Arkady, and especially to avoid private conversations with him, as if noticed by her aunt and the whole house. ... Besides, Anna Sergeevna had already been in a bad mood the night before; and even Katya herself felt embarrassed, as if she was conscious of her own guilt. Yielding to Arkady's request, she told herself that this was the last time.","Though an hour was still wanting to luncheon time, the dew and the freshness of the morning had already given place to the sultriness and the aridity of noontide. Arkady's face yet bore the expression of yesterday, but Katia's features were stamped with one, rather, of depression. This was because after breakfast her sister had called her into the boudoir, and to some of those blandishments which always alarmed the girl had added a word of advice that Katia should observe more caution in her converse with Arkady, and, above all things, avoid such solitary tête-à-têtes with him as appeared to have aroused the attention of the household in general, and of the Princess in particular. Since the previous evening Anna Sergievna had been out of humour; and inasmuch as Katia's conscience was not wholly clear of responsibility in the matter, she had intimated, when yielding to Arkady's request, that it must be for the last time.","There was about an hour still to lunch-time; the dewy morning had already given place to a sultry day. Arkady's face retained the expression of the preceding day; Katya had a preoccupied look. Her sister had, directly after their morning tea, called her into her room, and after some preliminary caresses, which always scared Katya a little, she had advised her to be more guarded in her behaviour with Arkady, and especially to avoid solitary talks with him, as likely to attract the notice of her aunt and all the household. Besides this, even the previous evening Anna Sergyevna had not been herself; and Katya herself had felt ill at ease, as though she were conscious of some fault in herself. As she yielded to Arkady's entreaties, she said to herself that it was for the last time.","There was still about an hour before luncheon; the heat of the day had already succeeded the dew of morning. Arkady’s face had kept its expression of the previous day; Katya looked anxious. Immediately after tea her sister had called her into her study and, after a caress, which always scared Katya, had advised her to be more careful in her behaviour with Arkady and particularly to avoid conversations with him alone, which had apparently been remarked by their aunt and the whole household. Moreover, the previous evening Anna Sergeyevna had been in a bad mood, and Katya herself had felt awkward as if she were acknowledging guilt. Acceding to Arkady’s request, she told herself it was for the last time."

You find fault with my attitude, but how do you know that I have got it by chance, that it's not a product of that very national spirit, in the name of which you wage war on it?'","‘What of that, if they deserve contempt!

"" Yes, let me go and explain to her why she need not shun me.""","'In that case I will go to her,' cried Arkady, with a fresh rush of magnanimous feeling, and he jumped up from his seat.

"Одинцова не изъявила особенного удивления, когда на другой день Аркадий сказал ей, что уезжает с Базаровым; она казалась рассеянною и усталою. Катя молча и серьезно посмотрела на него, княжна даже перекрестилась под своею шалью, так что он не мог этого не заметить; зато Ситников совершенно переполошился. Он только что сошел к завтраку в новом щегольском, на этот раз не славянофильском, наряде; накануне он удивил приставленного к нему человека множеством навезенного им белья, и вдруг его товарищи его покидают! Он немножко посеменил ногами, пометался, как гонный заяц на опушке леса, – и внезапно, почти с испугом, почти с криком объявил, что и он намерен уехать. Одинцова не стала его удерживать.","Odintsova expressed no particular surprise when the next day Arkady told her that he was leaving with Bazarov; she seemed absent-minded and tired. Katya silently and seriously looked at him, the princess even crossed herself under her shawl, so that he could not help but notice; on the other hand, Sitnikov was completely alarmed. He had just gone to breakfast in a new dandy, this time not Slavophil, attire; the day before, he surprised the man assigned to him with a lot of linen brought by him, and suddenly his comrades leave him! He sowed a little with his legs, darted about like a chasing hare at the edge of the forest - and suddenly, almost with fright, almost with a cry, announced that he also intended to leave. Odintsova did not stop him.","No particular astonishment was evinced by Madame Odintsov when, on the following day, Arkady informed her that it was his intention to accompany Bazarov. Rather, she looked distraught and weary. Katia glanced at him gravely and in silence, and the Princess went so far as to cross herself under her shawl—a precaution against the young men observing the gesture. Sitnikov too was dumbfounded at having just entered the breakfast-room in a new and most elegant suit (this time not of ""Slavophil"" cut, not to mention the fact that he had also had the pleasure of amazing his temporary valet with the multitude of his shirts), only to find himself confronted with the prospect of being deserted by his comrades! He shuffled and wriggled like a hare driven to the edge of a covert, and blurted out, almost in panic-stricken fashion, that he too had a great mind to depart. Nor did Madame Odintsov make any great effort to dissuade him.","Madame Odintsov expressed no special surprise when Arkady told her the next day that he was going with Bazarov; she seemed tired and absorbed. Katya looked at him silently and seriously; the princess went so far as to cross herself under her shawl so that he could not help noticing it. Sitnikov, on the other hand, was completely disconcerted. He had only just come in to lunch in a new and fashionable get-up, not on this occasion of a Slavophil cut; the evening before he had astonished the man told off to wait on him by the amount of linen he had brought with him, and now all of a sudden his comrades were deserting him! He took a few tiny steps, doubled back like a hunted hare at the edge of a copse, and abruptly, almost with dismay, almost with a wail, announced that he proposed going too. Madame Odintsov did not attempt to detain him.","Anna Sergeyevna expressed no particular surprise when Arkady told her the next day that he was leaving with Bazarov. She seemed distracted and tired. Katya silently gave him a serious look, the princess even crossed herself1 underneath her shawl in such a way that he couldn’t but notice it. But Sitnikov was thrown into a panic. He had just come down to breakfast in a new outfit (not a Slavophile one this time). The previous day he had astonished the manservant assigned to him by the quantities of linen he had brought with him. Now his friends were abandoning him!

"Николай Петрович позвонил и закричал: «Дуняша!» Но вместо Дуняши на террасу вышла сама Фенечка. Это была молодая женщина лет двадцати трех, вся беленькая и мягкая, с темными волосами и глазами, с красными, детски-пухлявыми губками и нежными ручками. На ней было опрятное ситцевое платье; голубая новая косынка легко лежала на ее круглых плечах. Она несла большую чашку какао и, поставив ее перед Павлом Петровичем, вся застыдилась: горячая кровь разлилась алою волной под тонкою кожицей ее миловидного лица. Она опустила глаза и остановилась у стола, слегка опираясь на самые кончики пальцев. Казалось, ей и совестно было, что она пришла, и в то же время она как будто чувствовала, что имела право прийти.","Nikolai Petrovich called and shouted: ""Dunyasha!"" But instead of Dunyasha, Fenechka herself came out onto the terrace. She was a young woman of about twenty-three, all white and soft, with dark hair and eyes, with red, plump childish lips and delicate hands. She was wearing a neat chintz dress; a blue new kerchief lay lightly on her round shoulders. She carried a large cup of cocoa and, placing it in front of Pavel Petrovich, was all ashamed: hot blood poured out in a red wave under the thin skin of her pretty face. She lowered her eyes and stood at the table, leaning lightly on the very tips of her fingers. It seemed that she was ashamed that she had come, and at the same time she seemed to feel that she had the right to come.","Nikolai Petrovitch did as requested, and also shouted for Duniasha; but, instead of the latter, there issued on to the terrace Thenichka in person.

Also, she was clad in a clean cotton gown, a new blue kerchief was thrown lightly over her rounded shoulders, and she was carrying in front of her a large cup of cocoa. Shyly she placed the latter before Paul Petrovitch, while a warm, rosy current of blood suffused the exquisite skin of her comely face, and then she remained standing by the table, with lowered eyes and the tips of her fingers touching its surface. Yet, though she looked as though she were regretting having come, she looked as though she felt that she had a right to be there.","Nikolai Petrovitch rang the bell and called, 'Dunyasha!' But instead of Dunyasha, Fenitchka herself came on to the terrace.

She wore a neat print dress; a new blue kerchief lay lightly on her plump shoulders. She carried a large cup of cocoa, and setting it down before Pavel Petrovitch, she was overwhelmed with confusion: the hot blood rushed in a wave of crimson over the delicate skin of her pretty face. She dropped her eyes, and stood at the table, leaning a little on the very tips of her fingers. It seemed as though she were ashamed of having come in, and at the same time felt that she had a right to come.","Nikolay Petrovich rang and called ‘Dunyasha!’ But instead of Dunyasha Fenechka herself came out on the terrace.

"Прошло шесть месяцев. Стояла белая зима с жестокою тишиной безоблачных морозов, плотным, скрипучим снегом, розовым инеем на деревьях, бледно-изумрудным небом, шапками дыма над трубами, клубами пара из мгновенно раскрытых дверей, свежими, словно укушенными лицами людей и хлопотливым бегом продрогших лошадок. Январский день уже приближался к концу; вечерний холод еще сильнее стискивал недвижимый воздух, и быстро гасла кровавая заря. В окнах марьинского дома зажигались огни; Прокофьич, в черном фраке и белых перчатках, с особенною торжественностию накрывал стол на семь приборов. Неделю тому назад, в небольшой приходской церкви, тихо и почти без свидетелей, состоялись две свадьбы: Аркадия с Катей и Николая Петровича с Фенечкой; а в самый тот день Николай Петрович давал прощальный обед своему брату, который отправлялся по делам в Москву. Анна Сергеевна уехала туда же тотчас после свадьбы, щедро наделив молодых.","Six months have passed. It was a white winter with the cruel silence of cloudless frosts, dense, creaky snow, pink frost on the trees, a pale emerald sky, puffs of smoke over the chimneys, puffs of steam from instantly opened doors, fresh, as if bitten, faces of people and the busy running of chilled horses. The January day was already drawing to a close; the evening chill squeezed the motionless air even more, and the bloody dawn was quickly extinguished. Lights were lit in the windows of the Maryinsky house; Prokofich, in a black dress coat and white gloves, was laying the table for seven dishes with particular solemnity. A week ago, in a small parish church, quietly and almost without witnesses, two weddings took place: Arkady with Katya and Nikolai Petrovich with Fenechka; and on that very day Nikolai Petrovich was giving a farewell dinner to his brother, who was on his way to Moscow on business. Anna Sergeevna went there immediately after the wedding, generously endowing the young.","Since that time six months have passed, and there has fallen upon the country a ""white"" winter—a winter of clear, keen, motionless frosts, of deep, crackling snow, of pink-rimed trees, of pale-emerald heavens, of smoke-capped chimneys, of puffs of vapour from momentarily opened doors, of faces fresh and hard-bitten, of horses galloping headlong to thaw their frozen limbs. It is now the close of a January day, and the increasing chill of evening is nipping the still air in an ever-tightening vice as the sun sinks downward into a sea of red. But in the windows of Marino there are lights burning, and Prokofitch, vested in a black tail-coat, a pair of white gloves, and a peculiar atmosphere of solemnity, is laying the table with seven covers. This is because a week ago there were solemnised in the tiny church of the parish—solemnised quietly, almost without a witness—two sets of nuptials: the nuptials of Arkady and Katia and those of Nikolai Petrovitch and Thenichka. And to-day Nikolai Petrovitch is offering his brother a farewell dinner, for the reason that Paul is on the point of departing for Moscow, whither Anna Sergievna has already removed after bestowing upon the younger of the two couples a handsome dowry.","Six months had passed by.

A January day was drawing to its close; the cold evening was more keen than ever in the motionless air, and a lurid sunset was rapidly dying away. There were lights burning in the windows of the house at Maryino; Prokofitch in a black frockcoat and white gloves, with a special solemnity, laid the table for seven. A week before in the small parish church two weddings had taken place quietly, and almost without witnesses—Arkady and Katya's, and Nikolai Petrovitch and Fenitchka's; and on this day Nikolai Petrovitch was giving a farewell dinner to his brother, who was going away to Moscow on business.

"Узнав об отъезде Базарова, Павел Петрович пожелал его видеть и пожал ему руку. Но Базаров и тут остался холоден как лед; он понимал, что Павлу Петровичу хотелось повеликодушничать. С Фенечкой ему не удалось проститься: он только переглянулся с нею из окна. Ее лицо показалось ему печальным. «Пропадет, пожалуй! – сказал он про себя… – Ну, выдерется как-нибудь!» Зато Петр расчувствовался до того, что плакал у него на плече, пока Базаров не охладил его вопросом: «Не на мокром ли месте у него глаза?», а Дуняша принуждена была убежать в рощу, чтобы скрыть свое волнение. Виновник всего этого горя взобрался на телегу, закурил сигару, и когда на четвертой версте, при повороте дороги, в последний раз предстала его глазам развернутая в одну линию кирсановская усадьба с своим новым господским домом, он только сплюнул и, пробормотав: «Барчуки проклятые», плотнее завернулся в шинель.","Upon learning of Bazarov's departure, Pavel Petrovich wished to see him and shook his hand. But even here Bazarov remained as cold as ice; he understood that Pavel Petrovich wanted to be magnanimous. He did not manage to say goodbye to Fenichka: he only exchanged glances with her from the window. Her face seemed sad to him. “Will be lost, perhaps! - he said to himself ... - Well, he'll get out somehow! "" But Peter was so deeply moved that he wept on his shoulder, until Bazarov chilled him with a question: ""Are his eyes on a wet spot?"" And Dunyasha was forced to run away into the grove to hide her excitement. The culprit of all this grief climbed onto the cart, lit a cigar, and when, at the fourth verst, at a turn in the road, the Kirsanov estate with its new manor house unfolded in one line appeared to his eyes for the last time, he just spat and, muttering: ""Damned Barchuks"" , wrapped himself tighter in his overcoat.","Paul Petrovitch, too, as soon as he heard that Bazarov was on the point of departing, expressed a desire to see him, and to shake hands with him. Yet Bazarov remained as cold as ice, for well he knew that Paul Petrovitch's only aim was to make a show of ""magnanimity,"" while to Thenichka he did not say good-bye at all—he merely exchanged with her a glance as she peeped from one of the windows. Her face looked to him careworn. ""Before long she will either trip or elope,"" he reflected. On the other hand, Peter was so moved at the prospect of parting with his patron that he wept on the latter's shoulder until his transports were cooled with the question: ""Surely your eyes are not made of water?"" while Duniasha's emotion was such that she had to take refuge in a thicket. Meanwhile the cause of all this grief mounted the travelling-cart, and lit a cigar; and even when he had travelled four versts, and reached a spot where a turn in the road brought the Kirsanov farm into line with the new manor-house, he merely expectorated some tobacco juice, and muttered, as he wrapped himself closer in his cloak: ""The cursed tomnoddies!""","When he heard of Bazarov's going, Pavel Petrovitch expressed a desire to see him, and shook his hand. But even then he remained as cold as ice; he realised that Pavel Petrovitch wanted to play the magnanimous. He did not succeed in saying good-bye to Fenitchka; he only exchanged glances with her at the window. Her face struck him as looking dejected. ' She'll come to grief, perhaps,' he said to himself.... ' But who knows? she'll pull through somehow, I dare say!' Piotr, however, was so overcome that he wept on his shoulder, till Bazarov damped him by asking if he'd a constant supply laid on in his eyes; while Dunyasha was obliged to run away into the wood to hide her emotion. The originator of all this woe got into a light cart, smoked a cigar, and when at the third mile, at the bend in the road, the Kirsanovs' farm, with its new house, could be seen in a long line, he merely spat, and muttering, 'Cursed snobs!' wrapped himself closer in his cloak.","When he heard of Bazarov’s coming departure, Pavel Petrovich said that he wanted to see him and shook hands. But on this occasion too Bazarov appeared cold as ice. He realized that Pavel Petrovich wanted to appear a little magnanimous. He didn’t manage to say goodbye to Fenechka: he just caught her eye through a window. He thought her face looked sad. ‘ That’ll surely pass!’ he said to himself. ‘She’ll somehow get over it!’ But Pyotr was so moved that he cried on his shoulder till Bazarov put him off with the chilly question ‘Do your eyes run?’ And Dunyasha was obliged to dash off to the wood in order to hide her emotion. The perpetrator of all this grief got into the carriage and lit up a cigar, and when after a couple of miles at a turn in the road the extended line of the Kirsanovs’ manor buildings with the new mansion appeared to him for the last time, he just spat and, muttering ‘Bloody gents!’ , he wrapped himself deeper in his overcoat."

Ну-с, вот я и отправился к «отцам», – так заключил Базаров, – и на дороге завернул сюда… чтобы все это передать, сказал бы я, если б я не почитал бесполезную ложь – глупостью. Нет, я завернул сюда – черт знает зачем. Видишь ли, человеку иногда полезно взять себя за хохол да выдернуть себя вон, как редьку из гряды; это я совершил на днях… Но мне захотелось взглянуть еще раз на то, с чем я расстался, на ту гряду, где я сидел.","“Yes, brother,” he said, “that's what it means to live with the feudal lords.

No, I turned in here - the devil knows why. You see, it is sometimes useful for a person to take himself by the crest and pull himself out like a radish from a ridge; I did this the other day ...

Should one's lot be cast among them, inevitably one gets drawn into their knightly tourneys. Being on my way to my parents' place, I have turned aside to But no; I will not be guilty of a foolish and useless lie. The real reason why I have turned aside is that—oh, the devil only knows why! Times there are when a man ought to take himself by the scruff of the neck, and uproot himself like a radish from a garden border. That is what I did when I was last here. But, since, a longing has come upon me to take just another peep at all that I then forsook—to view once more the border where I used to grow.""","'Yes, my dear fellow,' he commented, 'you see what comes of living with feudal personages.

No, I turned in here—the devil only knows why. You see , it's sometimes a good thing for a man to take himself by the scruff of the neck and pull himself up, like a radish out of its bed; that's what I've been doing of late.... But I wanted to have one more look at what I'm giving up, at the bed where I've been planted.'","‘Yes, my friend,’ he said, ‘that’s what comes of living with feudal barons.

Also, she blushed without ceasing, and drew her breath with a fluttering respiration.","When Katya spoke, she had a very charming smile, sweet, timid, and candid, and looked up from under her eyebrows with a sort of humorous severity.

"Прощаясь с матерью, он поцеловал ее в лоб, а она обняла его и за спиной, украдкой, его благословила трижды. Василий Иванович проводил Аркадия в его комнату и пожелал ему «такого благодатного отдохновения, какое и я вкушал в наши счастливые лета». И действительно, Аркадию отлично спалось в своем предбаннике: в нем пахло мятой, и два сверчка вперебивку усыпительно трещали за печкой. Василий Иванович отправился от Аркадия в свой кабинет и, прикорнув на диване в ногах у сына, собирался было поболтать с ним, но Базаров тотчас его отослал, говоря, что ему спать хочется, а сам не заснул до утра. Широко раскрыв глаза, он злобно глядел в темноту: воспоминания детства не имели власти над ним, да к тому ж он еще не успел отделаться от последних горьких впечатлений. Арина Власьевна сперва помолилась всласть, потом долго-долго беседовала с Анфисушкой, которая, став как вкопанная перед барыней и вперив в нее свой единственный глаз, передавала ей таинственным шепотом все свои замечания и соображения насчет Евгения Васильевича. У старушки от радости, от вина, от сигарочного дыма совсем закружилась голова; муж заговорил было с ней и махнул рукою.","Saying goodbye to his mother, he kissed her on the forehead, and she hugged him and behind his back, stealthily, she blessed him three times. Vasily Ivanovich escorted Arkady to his room and wished him ""such a blessed rest as I enjoyed in our happy years."" And indeed, Arkady slept well in his dressing room: it smelled of mint, and two crickets were jerking sleepily behind the stove. Vasily Ivanovich left Arkady for his study and, nestling on the sofa at his son's feet, was about to chat with him, but Bazarov immediately sent him away, saying that he wanted to sleep, but he did not fall asleep until morning. Eyes wide open, he gazed angrily into the darkness: childhood memories had no power over him, and besides, he had not yet had time to get rid of the last bitter impressions. Arina Vlasyevna first prayed to her heart's content, then for a long, long time talked with Anfisushka, who, standing rooted to the spot in front of the lady and gazing at her with her only eye, conveyed to her in a mysterious whisper all her comments and considerations about Evgeny Vasilyevich. The old woman was completely dizzy from joy, from wine, from cigar smoke; the husband started to speak to her and waved his hand.","Upon which the son said ""Good night"" to his mother, and kissed her on the forehead, while she bestowed upon him a threefold embrace and (covertly) a blessing; while Vasili Ivanitch conducted Arkady to his room, and wished him ""such God-given rest as I myself used to enjoy during the happier years of my life."" And certainly Arkady slept splendidly in the mint-scented annexe to the bathroom, where the only sound to be heard was that of a cricket chirping lustily against a rival from behind the stove. Meanwhile, on leaving Arkady, Vasili Ivanitch repaired to the study, where, squatting at the foot of the sofa, he was about to enter into a discursive conversation with his son when the latter dismissed him, on the plea that he desired, rather, to go to sleep. Yet never once did Bazarov close his eyes that night, but lay staring into the darkness, since his memories of childhood had less power to move him than had the remembrance of the bitter experience through which he had recently passed. For her part, Arina Vlasievna said her prayers with an overflowing heart, and then indulged in a long talk with Anfisushka; who, planted like a block before her mistress, with her solitary eye fixed upon the latter, communicated in a mysterious whisper her opinions and prognostications on the subject of Evgenii Vasilitch. Finally Arina Vlasievna's pleasurable emotion, coupled with the wine and the tobacco smoke, so caused the old lady's head to start whirling that, when her husband came to bed, he found himself obliged to moderate her exuberance with a gesture.","As he said good-night to his mother, he kissed her on the forehead, while she embraced him, and stealthily behind his back she gave him her blessing three times. Vassily Ivanovitch conducted Arkady to his room, and wished him 'as refreshing repose as I enjoyed at your happy years.' And Arkady did as a fact sleep excellently in his bath-house; there was a smell of mint in it, and two crickets behind the stove rivalled each other in their drowsy chirping. Vassily Ivanovitch went from Arkady's room to his study, and perching on the sofa at his son's feet, he was looking forward to having a chat with him; but Bazarov at once sent him away, saying he was sleepy, and did not fall asleep till morning. With wide open eyes he stared vindictively into the darkness; the memories of childhood had no power over him; and besides, he had not yet had time to get rid of the impression of his recent bitter emotions. Arina Vlasyevna first prayed to her heart's content, then she had a long, long conversation with Anfisushka, who stood stock-still before her mistress, and fixing her solitary eye upon her, communicated in a mysterious whisper all her observations and conjectures in regard to Yevgeny Vassilyevitch. The old lady's head was giddy with happiness and wine and tobacco smoke; her husband tried to talk to her, but with a wave of his hand gave it up in despair.","Saying goodnight to his mother, Bazarov kissed her on the forehead, and she embraced him and surreptitiously, behind his back, made the sign of the cross over him three times. Vasily Ivanovich took Arkady to his room and wished him ‘that health-giving repose I used to enjoy at your happy age’. And indeed Arkady slept very well in his changing room: it smelt of mint, and two crickets chirped soporifically to each other behind the stove. Vasily Ivanovich left Arkady to go to his study. He curled up on the couch at his son’s feet and was going to chat to him; however, Bazarov immediately asked him to go, saying he was sleepy, but he didn’t sleep till dawn. Eyes wide open, he stared angrily into the darkness: childhood memories had no power over him while he hadn’t yet had time to be free of his recent bitter experiences. Arina Vlasyevna first prayed her fill, then she talked for a long, long time to Anfisushka, who, standing stock-still before her mistress and fixing her single eye on her, communicated to her all her own observations and thoughts about Yevgeny Vasilyevich.

"Анна Сергеевна Одинцова родилась от Сергея Николаевича Локтева, известного красавца, афериста и игрока, который, продержавшись и прошумев лет пятнадцать в Петербурге и в Москве, кончил тем, что проигрался в прах и принужден был поселиться в деревне, где, впрочем, скоро умер, оставив крошечное состояние двум своим дочерям, Анне – двадцати и Катерине – двенадцати лет. Мать их, из обедневшего рода князей Х……, скончалась в Петербурге, когда муж ее находился еще в полной силе. Положение Анны после смерти отца было очень тяжело. Блестящее воспитание, полученное ею в Петербурге, не подготовило ее к перенесению забот по хозяйству и по дому, – к глухому деревенскому житью. Она не знала никого решительно в целом околотке, и посоветоваться ей было не с кем. Отец ее старался избегать сношений с соседями; он их презирал, и они его презирали, каждый по-своему. Она, однако, не потеряла головы и немедленно выписала к себе сестру своей матери, княжну Авдотью Степановну Х……ю, злую и чванную старуху, которая, поселившись у племянницы в доме, забрала себе все лучшие комнаты, ворчала и брюзжала с утра до вечера и даже по саду гуляла не иначе как в сопровождении единственного своего крепостного человека, угрюмого лакея в изношенной гороховой ливрее с голубым позументом и в треуголке. Анна терпеливо выносила все причуды тетки, исподволь занималась воспитанием сестры и, казалось, уже примирилась с мыслию увянуть в глуши… Но судьба сулила ей другое. Ее случайно увидел некто Одинцов, очень богатый человек лет сорока шести, чудак, ипохондрик,[85] пухлый, тяжелый и кислый, впрочем не глупый и не злой; влюбился в нее и предложил ей руку. Она согласилась быть его женой, – а он пожил с ней лет шесть и, умирая, упрочил за ней все свое состояние. Анна Сергеевна около года после его смерти не выезжала из деревни; потом отправилась вместе с сестрой за границу, но побывала только в Германии; соскучилась и вернулась на жительство в свое любезное Никольское, отстоявшее верст сорок от города ***. Там у ней был великолепный, отлично убранный дом, прекрасный сад с оранжереями: покойный Одинцов ни в чем себе не отказывал. В город Анна Сергеевна являлась очень редко, большею частью по делам, и то ненадолго. Ее не любили в губернии, ужасно кричали по поводу ее брака с Одинцовым, рассказывали про нее всевозможные небылицы, уверяли, что она помогала отцу в его шулерских проделках, что и за границу она ездила недаром, а из необходимости скрыть несчастные последствия… «Вы понимаете чего?» – договаривали негодующие рассказчики. «Прошла через огонь и воду», – говорили о ней; а известный губернский остряк обыкновенно прибавлял: «И через медные трубы». Все эти толки доходили до нее, но она пропускала их мимо ушей: характер у нее был свободный и довольно решительный.","Anna Sergeevna Odintsova was born from Sergei Nikolayevich Loktev, a famous handsome man, a swindler and a gambler who, after holding out and rustling for fifteen years in St. Petersburg and Moscow, ended up losing himself to dust and was forced to settle in the village, where, however, he soon died, leaving a tiny fortune to his two daughters, Anna - twenty and Katerina - twelve years old. Their mother, from an impoverished family of princes X ... ..., died in St. Petersburg, when her husband was still in full strength. Anna's position after her father's death was very difficult. The brilliant upbringing she received in St. Petersburg did not prepare her for the transfer of worries about the household and around the house - to a deaf country life. She did not know anyone in the whole neighborhood, and she had no one to consult with. Her father tried to avoid intercourse with neighbors; he despised them, and they despised him, each in his own way. She, however, did not lose her head and immediately wrote to her mother's sister, Princess Avdotya Stepanovna X ... ... yu, an angry and arrogant old woman, who, settling with her niece in the house, took all the best rooms for herself, grumbled and grumbled from morning to evening and she even walked around the garden accompanied by her only serf, a sullen lackey in a worn-out pea livery with a blue braid and a cocked hat. Anna patiently endured all the whims of her aunt, gradually engaged in raising her sister and, it seemed, had already come to terms with the idea of fading into the wilderness ... But fate promised her something else. She was accidentally seen by a certain Odintsov, a very rich man of about forty-six, an eccentric, hypochondriac, [85] plump, heavy and sour, but not stupid or evil; fell in love with her and offered her his hand. She agreed to be his wife, and he lived with her for six years and, dying, consolidated his entire fortune behind her. Anna Sergeevna did not leave the village for about a year after his death; then she went abroad with her sister, but only visited Germany; missed it and returned to live in her dear Nikolskoe, which was about forty versts from the city ***. There she had a magnificent, well-decorated house, a beautiful garden with greenhouses: the late Odintsov did not deny himself anything. Anna Sergeevna came to the city very rarely, mostly on business, and then only for a short time. They didn’t love her in the province, they shouted terribly about her marriage to Odintsov, told all sorts of tales about her, assured her that she had helped her father in his cheating tricks, that she had gone abroad for a reason, and out of the need to hide the unfortunate consequences ... “You understand what?"" - the indignant storytellers were saying. “I went through fire and water,” they said about her; and the well-known provincial wit usually added: ""And through copper pipes."" All these rumors reached her, but she ignored them: her character was free and rather decisive.","Anna Sergievna Odintsov had had for father one Sergei Nikolaievitch Loktev, a well-known gambler, speculator, and beau. After fifteen years of flaunting it in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and dissipating his whole substance, he had been forced to retire to the country, where soon afterwards he had died and left to his daughter Anna (aged twenty) and his daughter Katerina (aged twelve) only a small joint competence. As for the girls' mother (who had come of the impoverished house of the Princes X.), she had expired during the heyday of her husband's career in St. Petersburg. Anna's position after her father's death was therefore a very difficult one, for the brilliant education which she had received in the capital had in no way fitted her for the care of a household and an estate, nor yet for the endurance of a life in the country. Moreover, she possessed not a single acquaintance in that country neighbourhood, nor any one to whom to turn for advice, since her father had done his best to avoid associating with his neighbours, in that he had despised them as much as they, in their several ways, had despised him. Howbeit, Anna kept her head, and straightway sent for her mother's sister, the Princess Avdotia Stepanovna X., who, a malicious, presuming old woman, annexed, on the day of her arrival, all the best rooms in the house, raged and stormed from morning till night, and even declined to walk in the garden unless she could be accompanied by her only serf, a sullen-looking lacquey who wore a faded green livery, a blue collar, and a three-cornered hat. Nevertheless Anna put up with these tantrums of her aunt's, superintended the education of her sister, and resigned herself to the idea of living in seclusion for the rest of her life. But fate had ordained otherwise. That is to say, a certain Odintsov—a rich, bloated, unwieldy, soured, semi-imbecile hypochondriac of forty-six who was, nevertheless, neither stupid nor cruel—happened to see her, and became so enamoured that he offered her marriage: and to this proposal she consented. For six years the pair lived together, before the husband died, leaving her all his property. The following year she spent in the country; after which she went abroad with her sister—but only as far as Germany, since she quickly wearied of foreign parts, and was only too thankful to return to her beloved Nikolsköe, which lay some forty versts from the provincial town of ——. At Nikolsköe she had at her disposal a splendid, tastefully furnished mansion, a beautiful garden, and a range of orangeries (the late Odintsov having denied himself in nothing); but inasmuch as she made but rare appearances in the town, and then only on flying visits connected with business, the provincial gentry conceived a grudge against her, and took to gossiping of her marriage with Odintsov, and relating such impossible tales as that she had assisted her father in his nefarious schemes, that she had had her reasons for going abroad, and that certain unfortunate results of that tour had had to be concealed. ""I tell you,"" the ardent retailer of such fables would say, ""that she has been through the mill right enough."" Eventually these rumours reached her ears, but she ignored them altogether, since her nature was at once bold and independent.","Anna Sergyevna Odintsov was the daughter of Sergay Nikolaevitch Loktev, notorious for his personal beauty, his speculations, and his gambling propensities, who after cutting a figure and making a sensation for fifteen years in Petersburg and Moscow, finished by ruining himself completely at cards, and was forced to retire to the country, where, however, he soon after died, leaving a very small property to his two daughters—Anna, a girl of twenty, and Katya, a child of twelve. Their mother, who came of an impoverished line of princes—the H——s— had died at Petersburg when her husband was in his heydey. Anna's position after her father's death was very difficult. The brilliant education she had received in Petersburg had not fitted her for putting up with the cares of domestic life and economy,—for an obscure existence in the country. She knew positively no one in the whole neighbourhood, and there was no one she could consult. Her father had tried to avoid all contact with the neighbours; he despised them in his way, and they despised him in theirs. She did not lose her head, however, and promptly sent for a sister of her mother's Princess Avdotya Stepanovna H——, a spiteful and arrogant old lady, who, on installing herself in her niece's house, appropriated all the best rooms for her own use, scolded and grumbled from morning till night, and would not go a walk even in the garden unattended by her one serf, a surly footman in a threadbare pea-green livery with light blue trimming and a three-cornered hat. Anna put up patiently with all her aunt's whims, gradually set to work on her sister's education, and was, it seemed, already getting reconciled to the idea of wasting her life in the wilds.... But destiny had decreed another fate for her. She chanced to be seen by Odintsov, a very wealthy man of forty-six, an eccentric hypochondriac, stout, heavy, and sour, but not stupid, and not ill-natured; he fell in love with her, and offered her his hand. She consented to become his wife, and he lived six years with her, and on his death settled all his property upon her. Anna Sergyevna remained in the country for nearly a year after his death; then she went abroad with her sister, but only stopped in Germany; she got tired of it, and came back to live at her favourite Nikolskoe, which was nearly thirty miles from the town of X——. There she had a magnificent, splendidly furnished house and a beautiful garden, with conservatories; her late husband had spared no expense to gratify his fancies. Anna Sergyevna went very rarely to the town, generally only on business, and even then she did not stay long. She was not liked in the province; there had been a fearful outcry at her marriage with Odintsov, all sorts of fictions were told about her; it was asserted that she had helped her father in his cardsharping tricks, and even that she had gone abroad for excellent reasons, that it had been necessary to conceal the lamentable consequences ... 'You understand?' the indignant gossips would wind up. ' She has gone through the fire,' was said of her; to which a noted provincial wit usually added: ' And through all the other elements?' All this talk reached her; but she turned a deaf ear to it; there was much independence and a good deal of determination in her character.","Anna Sergeyevna Odintsova was the daughter of Sergey Nikolayevich Loktev, a man celebrated for his speculations, his gambling and his looks, who, after maintaining a very public existence in St Petersburg and Moscow for about fifteen years, finally lost everything at the tables and had to go to live in the country, where he soon died. He left a minute inheritance to his two daughters, Anna, who was twenty, and Katerina, who was twelve. Their mother, who came from the impoverished princely family of Kh–, had died in St Petersburg while her husband was still going strong. Anna’s situation after her father’s death was very hard. Her brilliant Petersburg education hadn’t prepared her for coping with estate and domestic chores, or for the boredom of country life. She knew absolutely no one in the whole neighbourhood, and she had no one from whom to take advice. Her father had tried to avoid contact with the neighbours; he despised them and they despised him, each in their own way. However, she didn’t lose her head and at once wrote and sent for her mother’s sister, Princess Avdotya Stepanovna Kh–ya, a proud and ill-tempered old woman who, as soon as she had settled in her niece’s house, took all the best rooms for herself. She groused and grumbled from morning till night and even on her walks in the garden she was always accompanied by her only serf, a glum footman in a worn pea-green livery with blue braid and a tricorne hat. Anna patiently put up with all her aunt’s caprices, occupied herself in the meantime with her sister’s education and seemed to have already reconciled herself to the thought of fading away in the depths of the country… But fate had decreed for her otherwise. She happened to catch the eye of one Odintsov, a very wealthy man of forty-six or so, an eccentric and hypochondriac, fat, heavy and depressive, but for all that far from stupid and a good man. He fell in love with her and offered her his hand. She consented to be his wife – and he lived with her for about six years and, dying, left her all his fortune. Anna Sergeyevna didn’t leave the estate for about a year after his death; then she and her sister went off abroad. But she went only to Germany. She missed home and came back to live in her beloved Nikolskoye, which was about twenty-five miles from the town of ***. There she had a magnificent, richly furnished house and a beautiful garden with hothouses: her late husband had denied himself nothing. Anna Sergeyevna went to the town very seldom, mostly on business and then only for short visits. She wasn’t liked in the province; her marriage to Odintsov had given rise to a terrible amount of talk; people told all manner of silly stories about her, averring that she had helped her father in his swindles, that she had gone abroad for a very good reason, out of the necessity of concealing the unfortunate consequences of… ‘ You know what of, don’t you?’ the indignant gossips would conclude. It was said of her, ‘She’s been through fire and water’; and a famous wit in the province would usually add, ‘And through copper piping too.’ All these rumours reached her, but she let them flow past her: she was a free spirit and quite strong-minded."
"Но ни Катя, ни Аркадий ее даже не поняли. Они ее дичились; невольно подслушанный разговор не выходил у них из головы. Впрочем, Анна Сергеевна скоро успокоила их; и это было ей нетрудно: она успокоилась сама.","But neither Katya nor Arkady even understood her. They were shy of her; the involuntarily overheard conversation did not leave their heads. However, Anna Sergeevna soon reassured them; and it was not difficult for her: she calmed down herself.","once she asked of Arkady and Katia: but neither of the pair understood her meaning. Moreover, they were fighting a little shy of her, since they could not altogether forget the conversation which they had involuntarily overheard; but in time Anna Sergievna succeeded in overcoming also this timidity, and found the task the more easy to perform in that she had succeeded also in overcoming her disappointment.

Глядя на нее, он только подумал: «А ведь недурно играет эта барышня, и сама она недурна».","Arkady was particularly struck by the last part of the sonata, the part in which, in the midst of the captivating gaiety of the carefree melody, sudden outbursts of such sad, almost tragic grief arise ... But the thoughts aroused in him by the sounds of Mozart were not related to Katya. Looking at her, he only thought: ""But this young lady is not playing badly, and she herself is not bad.""","Arkady also felt moved by the closing portion of the Sonata—the portion where the charming, careless gaiety of the melody gives place to sudden bursts of mournful, almost tragic lamentation. Yet the thoughts which Mozart's strains aroused in him bore no relation to Katia. He merely looked at her now and then, and reflected: ""She plays well; nor is she bad-looking.""","Arkady was particularly struck by the last part of the sonata, the part in which, in the midst of the bewitching gaiety of the careless melody, the pangs of such mournful, almost tragic suffering, suddenly break in.... But the ideas stirred in him by Mozart's music had no reference to Katya. Looking at her, he simply thought, 'Well, that young lady doesn't play badly, and she's not bad-looking either.'","The last part of the sonata made a particular impression on Arkady, the part where, amidst the enchanting gaiety of the light-hearted melody, there is a surge of such anguished, almost tragic grief… But his thoughts occasioned by the sounds of Mozart were not of Katya.

"– Анна Сергеевна, – поторопился сказать Базаров, – прежде всего я должен вас успокоить. Перед вами смертный, который сам давно опомнился и надеется, что и другие забыли его глупости. Я уезжаю надолго, и согласитесь, хоть я и не мягкое существо, но мне было бы невесело унести с собою мысль, что вы вспоминаете обо мне с отвращением.","“Anna Sergeevna,” Bazarov hastened to say, “first of all I must reassure you. Before you is a mortal who himself has long since come to his senses and hopes that others have forgotten his stupidity. I am leaving for a long time, and you must admit that although I am not a soft creature, it would be sad for me to carry with me the thought that you remember me with disgust.","""To begin with,"" Bazarov hastened to say, ""allow me to reassure you. You see before you a corpse which has long returned to its senses, and is also not destitute of hope that others have forgotten its folly. I am unlikely to see you again for an extended period, but, though (as you know) I am not given to sentiment, I feel that I should like to bear away with me the thought that my image still fills your mind with aversion.""","'Anna Sergyevna,' Bazarov hastened to say, 'before everything else I must set your mind at rest. Before you is a poor mortal, who has come to his senses long ago, and hopes other people too have forgotten his follies. I am going away for a long while; and though, as you will allow, I'm by no means a very soft creature, it would be anything but cheerful for me to carry away with me the idea that you remember me with repugnance.'","‘Anna Sergeyevna,’ Bazarov said hurriedly, ‘first I must give you some reassurance. Before you is a mortal who long ago came to his senses and hopes that others too have forgotten his folly. I am going away for a long time, and you must agree that, though I’m no soft creature, it would be depressing for me to take away with me the thought that you remember me with disgust.’"
"Базаров поморщился. В маленькой и невзрачной фигурке эманципированной женщины не было ничего безобразного; но выражение ее лица неприятно действовало на зрителя. Невольно хотелось спросить у ней: «Что ты, голодна? Или скучаешь? Или робеешь? Чего ты пружишься?» И у ней, как у Ситникова, вечно скребло на душе. Она говорила и двигалась очень развязно и в то же время неловко: она, очевидно, сама себя считала за добродушное и простое существо, и между тем что бы она ни делала, вам постоянно казалось, что она именно это-то и не хотела сделать; все у ней выходило, как дети говорят, – нарочно, то есть не просто, не естественно.","Bazarov winced. There was nothing ugly in the small and inconspicuous figure of the emancipated woman; but the expression on her face had an unpleasant effect on the viewer. Involuntarily I wanted to ask her: “What are you, hungry? Or do you miss? Or are you shy? Why are you springing? "" And like Sitnikov's, her soul was always scratching. She spoke and moved very casually and at the same time awkwardly: she obviously considered herself to be a good-natured and simple creature, and meanwhile, whatever she did, it always seemed to you that this was exactly what she did not want to do; everything turned out for her, as the children say - on purpose, that is, not simply, not naturally.","That said, she pressed his hand even as she had done Sitnikov's. Bazarov frowned, for though the plain, insignificant features of the emancipated lady contained nothing actually to repel, there was something in their mien which produced upon the beholder the sort of unpleasant impression which might have inclined him to ask her: ""Are you hungry, or bored, or afraid? At all events, what is it you want?"" Also, like Sitnikov, she kept pawing the air as she spoke, and her every word, her every gesture, revealed such a lack of control as at times amounted to sheer awkwardness. In short, though she conceived herself to be just a simple, good-hearted creature, her bearing was of the kind to lead the beholder to reflect that, no matter what she did, it was not what she had intended to do, and that everything was done (to use the children's term) "" on purpose""—that is to say, non-simply and non-naturally.","Bazarov scowled. There was nothing repulsive in the little plain person of the emancipated woman; but the expression of her face produced a disagreeable effect on the spectator. One felt impelled to ask her, 'What's the matter; are you hungry? Or bored? Or shy? What are you in a fidget about?' Both she and Sitnikov had always the same uneasy air. She was extremely unconstrained, and at the same time awkward; she obviously regarded herself as a good-natured, simple creature, and all the while, whatever she did, it always struck one that it was not just what she wanted to do; everything with her seemed, as children say, done on purpose, that's to say, not simply, not naturally.","Bazarov frowned. Though there was nothing especially repellent in the emancipated woman’s plain little figure, the expression of her face made an unpleasant impression on the viewer. It made you want to ask her, ‘What’s the matter with you? Are you hungry? Or bored? Or shy? Why are you so tense?’ Something inside was always nagging away at her, as it was with Sitnikov. Her speech and her movements were very fluent and at the same time clumsy. She clearly thought of herself as a good-natured and simple being, but, whatever she might be doing, she always seemed to want to be doing something else. Everything about her came over as ‘done on purpose’, as children say – i.e. as affected and artificial. ‘Yes, yes, I know you, Bazarov,’ she repeated."

"– Несчастный! – возопил Павел Петрович; он решительно не был в состоянии крепиться долее, – хоть бы ты подумал, что в России ты поддерживаешь твоею пошлою сентенцией![46] Нет, это может ангела из терпения вывести! Сила! И в диком калмыке и в монголе есть сила – да на что нам она? Нам дорога цивилизация, да-с, да-с, милостивый государь; нам дороги ее плоды. И не говорите мне, что эти плоды ничтожны: последний пачкун, ип barbouilleur,[47] тапёр, которому дают пять копеек за вечер, и те полезнее вас, потому что они представители цивилизации, а не грубой монгольской силы! Вы воображаете себя передовыми людьми, а вам только в калмыцкой кибитке сидеть! Сила! Да вспомните, наконец, господа сильные, что вас всего четыре человека с половиною, а тех – миллионы, которые не позволят вам попирать ногами свои священнейшие верования, которые раздавят вас!","- Unhappy! - cried Pavel Petrovich; he decidedly was not able to hold on any longer - even if you thought that in Russia you support with your vulgar maxim! [46] No, it can lead an angel out of patience! Power! And in the wild Kalmyk and in the Mongol there is power - but what do we need it for? Civilization is dear to us, yes, yes, sir, sir; its fruits are dear to us. And do not tell me that these fruits are insignificant: the last pacifier, un barbouilleur, [47] a pianist who is given five kopecks a night, and those are more useful than you, because they are representatives of civilization, not brute Mongolian power! You imagine yourself to be advanced people, and you only have to sit in a Kalmyk carriage! Power! Yes, remember, finally, gentlemen, that there are only four of you and a half, and there are millions of those who will not allow you to trample under your feet your most sacred beliefs, which will crush you!","""Fool!"" gasped Paul Petrovitch. Evidently he could contain himself no longer. "" Have you ever considered what you are maintaining with your miserable creed? Even an angel would lose patience! ' A force,' forsooth! You might as well say that the wild Kalmuck, or the barbaric Mongol, represents a force. What boots such a force? Civilisation and its fruits are what we value. And do not tell me that those fruits are to be overlooked, seeing that even the meanest barbouilleur,[3] the meanest piano-player who ever earned five kopecks a night, is of more use to society than you. For men of that kind at least stand for culture rather than for some rude, Mongolian propelling-power. Yes, you may look upon yourselves as 'the coming race,' yet you are fit but to sit in a Kalmuck shanty. ' A force,' forsooth! Good and 'forceful' sirs, I beg to tell you that you number but four men and a boy, whereas those others number millions, and are folk of the kind who will not permit such as you to trample upon their sacred beliefs, but will first trample upon your worthy selves.""","'Unhappy boy!' wailed Pavel Petrovitch, he was positively incapable of maintaining his firm demeanour any longer. ' If you could only realise what it is you are doing for your country. No; it's enough to try the patience of an angel! Force! There's force in the savage Kalmuck, in the Mongolian; but what is it to us? What is precious to us is civilisation; yes, yes, sir, its fruits are precious to us. And don't tell me those fruits are worthless; the poorest dauber, un barbouilleur, the man who plays dance music for five farthings an evening, is of more use than you, because they are the representatives of civilisation, and not of brute Mongolian force! You fancy yourselves advanced people, and all the while you are only fit for the Kalmuck's hovel! Force! And recollect, you forcible gentlemen, that you're only four men and a half, and the others are millions, who won't let you trample their sacred traditions under foot, who will crush you and walk over you!'","cried Pavel Petrovich, quite unable to contain himself any longer. ‘If you’d only think what you are supporting in Russia with your second-rate phrase! No, it would try the patience of an angel! A force! There is a force in a savage Kalmuck and in a Mongol – but why do we need it? Civilization is our road, yes, yes, sir, it is. We value the fruits she bears. And don’t tell me those fruits are worthless. The humblest dauber, un barbouilleur,8 the cheap pianist who gets five kopecks for an evening, they all bring more benefit than you do, because they are representatives of civilization and not of crude Mongol force! You imagine yourselves to be advanced – only to sit in a Kalmuck cart! A force! And lastly, do remember this, you men of force – there are just four and a half of you, but the rest are millions strong. They won’t let you trample their most hallowed beliefs underfoot.

"Павел Петрович Кирсанов воспитывался сперва дома, так же как и младший брат его Николай, потом в Пажеском корпусе.[31] Он с детства отличался замечательною красотой; к тому же он был самоуверен, немного насмешлив и как-то забавно желчен – он не мог не нравиться. Он начал появляться всюду, как только вышел в офицеры. Его носили на руках, и он сам себя баловал, даже дурачился, даже ломался; но и это к нему шло. Женщины от него с ума сходили, мужчины называли его фатом и втайне завидовали ему. Он жил, как уже сказано, на одной квартире с братом, которого любил искренно, хотя нисколько на него не походил. Николай Петрович прихрамывал, черты имел маленькие, приятные, но несколько грустные, небольшие черные глаза и мягкие жидкие волосы; он охотно ленился, но и читал охотно, и боялся общества. Павел Петрович ни одного вечера не проводил дома, славился смелостию и ловкостию (он ввел было гимнастику в моду между светскою молодежью) и прочел всего пять-шесть французских книг. На двадцать восьмом году от роду он уже был капитаном; блестящая карьера ожидала его. Вдруг все изменилось.","Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov was brought up first at home, just like his younger brother Nikolai, then in the Corps of Pages.

He began to appear everywhere as soon as he became an officer. He was carried in his arms, and he spoiled himself, even played the fool, even broke; but it also went to him. Women went crazy with him, men called him a veil and secretly envied him. He lived, as already mentioned, in the same apartment with his brother, whom he loved sincerely, although he did not at all resemble him. Nikolai Petrovich limped, his features were small, pleasant, but somewhat sad, small black eyes and soft liquid hair; he was willingly lazy, but he also read willingly, and was afraid of society. Pavel Petrovich did not spend a single evening at home, was famous for his courage and dexterity (he introduced gymnastics into fashion among secular youth) and read only five or six French books. At the twenty-eighth year of age, he was already a captain; a brilliant career awaited him. Suddenly everything changed.","""Like his brother, Paul Petrovitch Kirsanov received his early education at home, and entered the Imperial Corps of Pages. Distinguished from boyhood for his good looks, he had, in addition, a nature of the self-confident, quizzical, amusingly sarcastic type which never fails to please. As soon, therefore, as he had received his officer's commission, he began to go everywhere in society, to set the pace, to amuse himself, to play the rake, and to squander his money. Yet these things somehow consorted well with his personality, and women went nearly mad over him, while men called him 'Fate,' and secretly detested him. Meanwhile he rented a flat with his brother, for whom, in spite of their dissimilarity, he had a genuine affection. The dissimilarity in question lay, among other things, in the fact that, while Nikolai Petrovitch halted, had small, kindly, rather melancholy features and narrow black eyes, and was of a disposition prone to reading omnivorously, to bestirring himself but little, and to feeling nervous when attending social functions, Paul Petrovitch never spent a single evening at home, but was renowned for his physical dexterity and daring (he it was who made gymnastics the rage among the gilded youth of his day), and read, at most, five or six French novels. Indeed, by the time that he reached his twenty-eighth year Paul had risen to be a captain, and before him there seemed to lie a brilliant career; but everything suddenly underwent a change, as shall be related forthwith.","Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov was educated first at home, like his younger brother, and afterwards in the Corps of Pages. From childhood he was distinguished by remarkable beauty; moreover he was self-confident, somewhat ironical, and had a rather biting humour; he could not fail to please.

He was much admired in society, and he indulged every whim, even every caprice and every folly, and gave himself airs, but that too was attractive in him.

He lived, as has been related already, in the same apartments as his brother, whom he loved sincerely, though he was not at all like him. Nikolai Petrovitch was a little lame, he had small, pleasing features of a rather melancholy cast, small, black eyes, and thin, soft hair; he liked being lazy, but he also liked reading, and was timid in society.

"Павлу Петровичу скоро полегчило; но в постели пришлось ему пролежать около недели. Он переносил свой, как он выражался, плен довольно терпеливо, только уж очень возился с туалетом и все приказывал курить одеколоном. Николай Петрович читал ему журналы, Фенечка ему прислуживала по-прежнему, приносила бульон, лимонад, яйца всмятку, чай; но тайный ужас овладевал ею каждый раз, когда она входила в его комнату. Неожиданный поступок Павла Петровича запугал всех людей в доме, а ее больше всех; один Прокофьич не смутился и толковал, что и в его время господа дирывались, «только благородные господа между собою, а этаких прощелыг они бы за грубость на конюшне отодрать велели».","Pavel Petrovich soon felt better; but he had to lie in bed for about a week. He endured his, as he put it, captivity rather patiently, only he was very busy with the toilet and ordered everyone to smoke cologne. Nikolai Petrovich read magazines to him, Fenechka served him as before, brought broth, lemonade, soft-boiled eggs, tea; but a secret terror seized her every time she entered his room. Pavel Petrovich's unexpected act intimidated all the people in the house, and her more than anyone else; only Prokofich was not embarrassed and interpreted that even in his time the gentlemen were fighting, ""only noble gentlemen among themselves, and they would have been forgiven for being rude in the stable to rip them off.""","Thenceforth Paul Petrovitch began to mend, but still was ordered to keep his bed for another week. What he called his ""imprisonment"" he bore with very fair patience, although he remained fussy in the matter of his toilet, and constantly had himself sprinkled with eau-de-Cologne. Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovitch read aloud to him the newspapers, and Thenichka served him with soup, lemonade, scrambled eggs, and tea. Yet she never entered the room without feeling a mysterious nervousness come over her. Paul Petrovitch's unexpected behaviour had frightened every one in the house, but her it had frightened most of all. Only old Prokofitch seemed undismayed at the occurrence, and kept asserting that, in his day, ""the gentry used to bore holes in one another right enough, but only the gentry.

Pavel Petrovitch's unexpected action had alarmed every one in the house, and her more than any one; Prokofitch was the only person not agitated by it; he discoursed upon how gentlemen in his day used to fight, but only with real gentlemen; low curs like that they used to order a horsewhipping in the stable for their insolence.","Pavel Petrovich soon felt better, but he had to stay in bed for about a week.

"Ровно в три часа все собрались к столу. Митю поместили тут же; у него уже появилась нянюшка в глазетовом кокошнике. Павел Петрович восседал между Катей и Фенечкой; «мужья» пристроились возле своих жен. Знакомцы наши изменились в последнее время: все как будто похорошели и возмужали; один Павел Петрович похудел, что, впрочем, придавало еще больше изящества и грансеньйорства его выразительным чертам… Да и Фенечка стала другая. В свежем шелковом платье, с широкою бархатною наколкой на волосах, с золотою цепочкой на шее, она сидела почтительно-неподвижно, почтительно к самой себе, ко всему, что ее окружало, и так улыбалась, как будто хотела сказать: «Вы меня извините, я не виновата». И не она одна – другие все улыбались и тоже как будто извинялись; всем было немножко неловко, немножко грустно и в сущности очень хорошо. Каждый прислуживал другому с забавною предупредительностию, точно все согласились разыграть какую-то простодушную комедию. Катя была спокойнее всех: она доверчиво посматривала вокруг себя, и можно было заметить, что Николай Петрович успел уже полюбить ее без памяти. Перед концом обеда он встал и, взяв бокал в руки, обратился к Павлу Петровичу.","At exactly three o'clock, everyone gathered at the table. Mitya was placed right there; he already had a nanny in a big headdress. Pavel Petrovich sat between Katya and Fenechka; ""Husbands"" settled down next to their wives. Our acquaintances have changed recently: everyone seemed to be prettier and matured; Pavel Petrovich alone lost weight, which, incidentally, made his expressive features even more graceful and grand-seigneur ... Yes, and Fenechka became different. In a fresh silk dress, with a wide velvet headdress on her hair, with a gold chain around her neck, she sat respectfully motionless, respectfully towards herself, towards everything that surrounded her, and smiled as if she wanted to say: “Excuse me, I’m not to blame. ” And she was not alone - the others all smiled and also seemed to apologize; everyone was a little awkward, a little sad and, in fact, very good. Each served the other with an amusing courtesy, as if all had agreed to play some kind of simple-minded comedy. Katya was the calmer of all: she looked around her trustingly, and one could notice that Nikolai Petrovich had already managed to fall in love with her without memory. Before the end of dinner, he got up and, taking the glass in his hands, turned to Pavel Petrovich.","At three o'clock precisely the company gathers around the board. Mitia too is present with his niania (in nurse's cap), while Paul Petrovitch is seated between Katia and Thenichka, and the bridegrooms are ranged one on either side of their newly-wedded spouses. A change has taken place in our old acquaintances since last we saw them—they have improved, as regards the younger ones, both in appearance and in sedateness of demeanour. Only Paul Petrovitch looks thinner; though the circumstance imparts, if anything, an added touch of refinement and ""grand-seignorishness"" to his always expressive features. Thenichka, in particular, is a different person from what she was. Clad in a brand-new silken gown, and wearing a broad velvet band over her hair and a necklace around her throat, she holds herself with an immovable dignity, yet also with an immovable deference towards her surroundings. And meanwhile she smiles, as much as to say: ""Pardon me, but I am not responsible for this""; while the others respond with similar smiles, as though they too would be glad to excuse themselves for their share in the proceedings. Yet the fact that on every one present sits a touch of gravity and embarrassment becomes the company no less than do their other characteristics. Everywhere, too, there is to be seen such an anxious solicitude for mutual wants that the company could seem unanimously to be playing some simple-minded comedy; and though, of the guests, the quietest is Katia, it is plain, from her confidence of bearing, that, as a daughter-in-law, she has found favour in the eyes of Nikaiai Petrovitch. At length the meal comes to an end, and Nikolai, rising and grasping a wine-glass, addresses Paul Petrovitch:","Precisely at three o'clock they all gathered about the table. Mitya was placed there too; with him appeared a nurse in a cap of glazed brocade. Pavel Petrovitch took his seat between Katya and Fenitchka; the 'husbands' took their places beside their wives. Our friends had changed of late; they all seemed to have grown stronger and better looking; only Pavel Petrovitch was thinner, which gave even more of an elegant and 'grand seigneur' air to his expressive features.... And Fenitchka too was different. In a fresh silk gown, with a wide velvet head-dress on her hair, with a gold chain round her neck, she sat with deprecating immobility, respectful towards herself and everything surrounding her, and smiled as though she would say, 'I beg your pardon; I'm not to blame.' And not she alone—all the others smiled, and also seemed apologetic; they were all a little awkward, a little sorry, and in reality very happy. They all helped one another with humorous attentiveness, as though they had all agreed to rehearse a sort of artless farce. Katya was the most composed of all; she looked confidently about her, and it could be seen that Nikolai Petrovitch was already devotedly fond of her. At the end of dinner he got up, and, his glass in his hand, turned to Pavel Petrovitch.","They all came to the table at exactly three o’clock. A place had also been laid there for Mitya, who had already acquired a nursemaid in a brocade kokoshnik.1 Pavel Petrovich took his seat between Katya and Fenechka. The ‘bridegrooms’ were placed on either side of their wives. Our friends have changed recently: they have all gained in looks and in maturity. Only Pavel Petrovich has become thinner; that incidentally has given his expressive features even more of the elegant look of a grand seigneur2… Fenechka too has changed. In a new silk dress, with a broad velvet snood over her hair and a gold chain round her neck, she sits calmly, with a sense of respect towards herself and towards all around her, and with a smile on her lips as if she would say, ‘I’m sorry, it’s not my doing.’ And she wasn’t the only one smiling – the others also all smiled apologetically. Everyone felt a little awkward, a little sad but, if truth be told, in a very good mood. Everyone looked after their neighbours with comic attentiveness as if they had all agreed to play out some artless comedy. Katya said less than anyone. She looked trustingly around her, and it was obvious that she had already completely won the heart of Nikolay Petrovich. Before the end of the meal he rose and, taking a glass in his hand, turned to Pavel Petrovich."
"– Пойдемте, матушка, в самом деле, – промолвил Базаров и повел в дом ослабевшую старушку. Усадив ее в покойное кресло, он еще раз наскоро обнялся с отцом и представил ему Аркадия.","“Come on, mother, in fact,” said Bazarov, and led the weakened old woman into the house. Having made her sit down in a quiet armchair, he hastily embraced his father once again and introduced him to Arkady.","""Yes, yes, dear mother; let us go indoors,"" said Bazarov. Leading the shaking old lady into the house, he seated her in a cosy chair, bestowed upon his father another hurried embrace, and then presented Arkady.","'Let's come in, mother, really,' said Bazarov, and he led the enfeebled old woman into the house. Putting her into a comfortable armchair, he once more hurriedly embraced his father and introduced Arkady to him.","‘Come on, Mother, really,’ said Bazarov and led the exhausted old woman into the house. Having put her into a comfortable chair, he again gave his father a quick hug and introduced Arkady to him."
"Катя не спеша перевела свои глаза на сестру (изящно, даже изысканно одетая, она стояла на дорожке и кончиком раскрытого зонтика шевелила уши Фифи) и не спеша промолвила:","Katya slowly turned her eyes to her sister (gracefully, even exquisitely dressed, she stood on the path and wiggled Fifi's ears with the tip of an open umbrella) and slowly said:","Katia slowly raised her eyes to her sister (tastefully, and even showily, dressed, the latter was standing on the path, and engaged in stirring Fin's ears with the point of an open parasol), and as slowly replied:","Katya slowly raised her eyes to her sister (elegantly, even elaborately dressed, she was standing in the path and tickling Fifi's ears with the tip of her open parasol), and slowly replied, 'Yes, I'm alone.'","Katya slowly raised her eyes to her sister. Elegantly, even exquisitely dressed, she was standing on the path and tickling Fifi’s ears with the tip of her open parasol."
"– Я надеюсь, что никакой истории не выйдет, Евгений Васильич… Мне очень жаль, что ваше пребывание в моем доме получило такое… такой конец. Мне это тем огорчительнее, что Аркадий…","- I hope that no story will come out, Evgeny Vasilich ... I am very sorry that your stay in my house received such ... such an end. This is all the more upsetting to me that Arkady ...","""I hope that nothing will occur. Indeed, my one regret is that your stay in my house should have—should have terminated in such a fashion. And I am the more grieved in that Arkady—-""","'I hope there will be no fuss, Yevgeny Vassilyitch.... I am very sorry your stay in my house should have such a ... such an end. It is the more distressing to me through Arkady's ...'","‘I hope no story comes out, Yevgeny Vasilyich… I’m very sorry that your stay in my house has had such a… such an end. I feel the worse that Arkady…’"

"– Да, надо почиститься, – отвечал Аркадий и направился было к дверям, но в это мгновение вошел в гостиную человек среднего роста, одетый в темный английский сьют,[12] модный низенький галстух и лаковые полусапожки, Павел Петрович Кирсанов. На вид ему было лет сорок пять: его коротко остриженные седые волосы отливали темным блеском, как новое серебро; лицо его, желчное, но без морщин, необыкновенно правильное и чистое, словно выведенное тонким и легким резцом, являло следы красоты замечательной: особенно хороши были светлые, черные, продолговатые глаза. Весь облик Аркадиева дяди, изящный и породистый, сохранил юношескую стройность и то стремление вверх, прочь от земли, которое большею частью исчезает после двадцатых годов.","“Yes, we need to clean up,” answered Arkady and was about to go to the door, but at that moment a man of average height, dressed in a dark English suite, [12] a fashionable low tie and lacquered ankle boots, Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov entered the living room. He looked about forty-five years old: his short-cropped gray hair gleamed with a dark sheen, like new silver; his face, bilious, but without wrinkles, unusually regular and clean, as if drawn with a thin and light incisor, showed traces of remarkable beauty: his light, black, oblong eyes were especially good. The whole appearance of Arkadiev's uncle, graceful and thoroughbred, retained youthful harmony and that striving upward, away from the earth, which for the most part disappears after the twenties.","At that moment it opened to admit a man of medium height who was dressed in a dark English suit, a fashionably low collar, and a pair of patent leather boots. This was Paul Petrovitch Kirsanov. Although forty-five, he had close-cropped grey hair of the sheen of new silver, and his sallow, unwrinkled face was as clear-cut and regular of outline as though carved with a light, fine chisel. Still retaining traces of remarkable comeliness, his bright, black, oblong eyes had a peculiar attraction, and his every well-bred, refined feature showed that symmetry of youth, that air of superiority to the rest of the world which usually disappears when once the twenties have been passed.","'Yes, I must wash,' answered Arkady, and was just moving towards the door, but at that instant there came into the drawing-room a man of medium height, dressed in a dark English suit, a fashionable low cravat, and kid shoes, Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov. He looked about forty-five: his close-cropped, grey hair shone with a dark lustre, like new silver; his face, yellow but free from wrinkles, was exceptionally regular and pure in line, as though carved by a light and delicate chisel, and showed traces of remarkable beauty; specially fine were his clear, black, almond-shaped eyes. The whole person of Arkady's uncle, with its aristocratic elegance, had preserved the gracefulness of youth and that air of striving upwards, away from earth, which for the most part is lost after the twenties are past.","‘Yes, I must clean myself up,’ Arkady answered and moved towards the door. But at that moment a man came into the drawing room. He was of medium height and wore a dark English suit, a fashionable low-cut cravat and patent leather boots. It was Pavel Petrovich Kirsanov. He looked about forty-five. His short-cut grey hair shone with the dark sheen of new silver.1 His features, while revealing irritability, were unlined; they were exceptionally regular and clean-cut, as if chiselled with delicate, light strokes, and showed the remains of remarkable good looks. His brilliant, dark, elongated eyes were particularly fine. Arkady’s uncle’s whole way of holding himself displayed elegance and breeding; he had kept a young man’s grace and that upright carriage, standing very straight, which usually disappears after thirty."
"– Знаешь ли что? – говорил в ту же ночь Базаров Аркадию. – Мне в голову пришла великолепная мысль. Твой отец сказывал сегодня, что он получил приглашение от этого вашего знатного родственника. Твой отец не поедет; махнем-ка мы с тобой в ***; ведь этот господин и тебя зовет. Вишь, какая сделалась здесь погода; а мы прокатимся, город посмотрим. Поболтаемся дней пять-шесть, и баста!","- Do you know what? Bazarov said to Arkady that very night. “A great idea came to my mind. Your father said today that he received an invitation from this distinguished relative of yours. Your father will not go; let’s wave you and me at ***; because this gentleman is calling you too. See what the weather has become here; and we'll take a ride, we'll see the city. Let's chat for five or six days, and that's it!","""I tell you what,"" Bazarov said to Arkady the same night. ""A splendid idea has come into my head. You know that to-day your father said that a certain eminent relation had sent him an invitation which he had no intention of accepting. Well, how would it be if you and I were to accept it, seeing that you too have been included in the honour? The weather has turned beautiful, and we might drive over and look at the town, and thus, incidentally, secure a few days' uninterrupted talk together.""","'Do you know what?' Bazarov was saying to Arkady the same night. ' I've got a splendid idea. Your father was saying to-day that he'd had an invitation from your illustrious relative. Your father's not going; let us be off to X——; you know the worthy man invites you too. You see what fine weather it is; we'll stroll about and look at the town. We'll have five or six days' outing, and enjoy ourselves.'","‘Do you know what?’ Bazarov said to Arkady that same evening. ‘I’ve had a splendid idea. Your father was saying today he’d had an invitation from that grand relative of yours. Your father isn’t going. Why don’t you and I slip away to *** – he was asking you as well. The weather here’s turned pretty bad, but we can have a nice trip and look at the town. We’ll get five or six days’ fun, and that’s it!’"
– Вы счастливее меня.,- You are happier than me.,"""Then you have the advantage of me,"" he said.",You are more fortunate than I am.',‘You’re more fortunate than me.’
"– Спустите штору и сядьте, – промолвила Одинцова, – мне хочется поболтать с вами перед вашим отъездом. Расскажите мне что-нибудь о самом себе; вы никогда о себе не говорите.","“Draw the curtains and sit down,” said Odintsova, “I would like to chat with you before you leave. Tell me something about yourself; you never talk about yourself.","""Also, please pull down the blind, and then resume your seat. I wish to have a little further talk with you before you go. Tell me something about yourself—a person to whom, by the way, you never refer.""","'Draw the blind and sit down,' said Madame Odintsov; 'I want to have a talk with you before you go away. Tell me something about yourself; you never talk about yourself.'","‘Pull down the blind and sit down,’ said Anna Sergeyevna. ‘I want to chat to you before you go. Tell me something about yourself.

"Между тем Николай Петрович тоже проснулся и отправился к Аркадию, которого застал одетым. Отец и сын вышли на террасу, под навес маркизы; возле перил, на столе, между большими букетами сирени, уже кипел самовар. Явилась девочка, та самая, которая накануне первая встретила приезжих на крыльце, и тонким голосом проговорила:","Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovich also woke up and went to Arkady, whom he found dressed. Father and son went out onto the terrace, under the awning of the marquise; by the railing, on the table, between large bouquets of lilacs, a samovar was already boiling. A girl appeared, the one who had first met the newcomers on the porch the day before, and said in a thin voice:","Nikolai Petrovitch too had left his bed, and, on going to visit Arkady, found him fully dressed; wherefore father and son proceeded to repair to the terrace, and there seated themselves under the shade of the awning. Amid nosegays of lilac, a tea-urn was simmering on a table by the balustrade, and presently there appeared upon the scene also the damsel who, on the previous night, had met the arrivals on the verandah. She announced in shrill tones:","Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovitch too had waked up, and gone in to see Arkady, whom he found dressed. The father and son went out on to the terrace under the shelter of the awning; near the balustrade, on the table, among great bunches of lilacs, the samovar was already boiling. A little girl came up, the same who had been the first to meet them at the steps on their arrival the evening before. In a shrill voice she said—","Meanwhile Nikolay Petrovich too had woken and went in to Arkady, whom he found dressed. Father and son went out on to the terrace covered by an awning.

I don't hate anybody,' observed Arkady, after a moment's thought.","‘That’s odd! I don’t loathe anyone,’ Arkady said, having thought a moment."
"– Нисколько, – ответил Аркадий.","""Not at all,"" answered Arkady.","""By no means,"" replied Arkady with alacrity.","'Oh, not at all,' answered Arkady.","‘Not at all,’ answered Arkady."

"Но Аркадий был прав. Анна Сергеевна пожелала повидаться с Базаровым и пригласила его к себе через дворецкого. Базаров переоделся, прежде чем пошел к ней: оказалось, что он уложил свое новое платье так, что оно было у него под рукою.",But Arkady was right.

Bazarov changed his clothes before going to her: it turned out that he had arranged his new dress so that it was under his hand.,"But Arkady proved to be right, for Anna Sergievna really desired to see Bazarov, and, through the butler, sent him word to that effect. After tidying his costume, therefore, and tucking his new great-coat under his arm (in readiness to depart as soon as the interview should be concluded), he went downstairs, and was received, not in the room where he had unexpectedly disclosed his passion, but in the drawing-room.","But Arkady was right.

"Однажды – дело было утром – Павел Петрович хорошо себя чувствовал и перешел с постели на диван, а Николай Петрович, осведомившись об его здоровье, отлучился на гумно.

Павел Петрович ее удержал.","One day - it was in the morning - Pavel Petrovich was feeling well and moved out of bed to the sofa, and Nikolai Petrovich, inquiring about his health, went to the threshing floor.

"Время (дело известное) летит иногда птицей, иногда ползет червяком; но человеку бывает особенно хорошо тогда, когда он даже не замечает – скоро ли, тихо ли оно проходит. Аркадий и Базаров именно таким образом провели дней пятнадцать у Одинцовой. Этому отчасти способствовал порядок, который она завела у себя в доме и в жизни. Она строго его придерживалась и заставляла других ему покоряться. Все в течение дня совершалось в известную пору. Утром, ровно в восемь часов, все общество собиралось к чаю; от чая до завтрака всякий делал что хотел, сама хозяйка занималась с приказчиком (имение было на оброке), с дворецким, с главною ключницей. Перед обедом общество опять сходилось для беседы или для чтения; вечер посвящался прогулке, картам, музыке; в половине одиннадцатого Анна Сергеевна уходила к себе в комнату, отдавала приказания на следующий день и ложилась спать. Базарову не нравилась эта размеренная, несколько торжественная правильность ежедневной жизни; «как по рельсам катишься», – уверял он: ливрейные лакеи, чинные дворецкие оскорбляли его демократическое чувство. Он находил, что уж если на то пошло, так обедать следовало бы по-английски, во фраках и в белых галстухах. Он однажды объяснился об этом с Анной Сергеевной. Она так себя держала, что каждый человек, не обинуясь, высказывал перед ней свои мнения. Она выслушала его и промолвила: «С вашей точки зрения, вы правы, и, может быть, в этом случае я – барыня; но в деревне нельзя жить беспорядочно, скука одолеет», – и продолжала делать по-своему. Базаров ворчал; но и ему и Аркадию оттого и жилось так легко у Одинцовой, что все в ее доме «катилось как по рельсам». Со всем тем в обоих молодых людях, с первых же дней их пребывания в Никольском, произошла перемена. В Базарове, к которому Анна Сергеевна очевидно благоволила, хотя редко с ним соглашалась, стала проявляться небывалая прежде тревога: он легко раздражался, говорил нехотя, глядел сердито и не мог усидеть на месте, словно что его подмывало; а Аркадий, который окончательно сам с собой решил, что влюблен в Одинцову, начал предаваться тихому унынию. Впрочем, это уныние не мешало ему сблизиться с Катей; оно даже помогло ему войти с нею в ласковые, приятельские отношения. «Меня она не ценит! Пусть!.. А вот доброе существо меня не отвергает», – думал он, и сердце его снова вкушало сладость великодушных ощущений. Катя смутно понимала, что он искал какого-то утешения в ее обществе, и не отказывала ни ему, ни себе в невинном удовольствии полустыдливой, полудоверчивой дружбы. В присутствии Анны Сергеевны они не разговаривали между собою: Катя всегда сжималась под зорким взглядом сестры, а Аркадий, как оно и следует влюбленному человеку, вблизи своего предмета уже не мог обращать внимание ни на что другое; но хорошо ему было с одной Катей. Он чувствовал, что не в силах занять Одинцову; он робел и терялся, когда оставался с ней наедине; и она не знала, что ему сказать: он был слишком для нее молод. Напротив, с Катей Аркадий был как дома; он обращался с ней снисходительно, не мешал ей высказывать впечатления, возбужденные в ней музыкой, чтением повестей, стихов и прочими пустяками, сам не замечая или не сознавая, что эти пустяки и его занимали. С своей стороны, Катя не мешала ему грустить. Аркадию было хорошо с Катей, Одинцовой – с Базаровым, а потому обыкновенно случалось так: обе парочки, побыв немного вместе, расходились каждая в свою сторону, особенно во время прогулок. Катя обожала природу, и Аркадий ее любил, хоть и не смел признаться в этом; Одинцова была к ней довольно равнодушна, так же как и Базаров. Почти постоянное разъединение наших приятелей не осталось без последствий: отношения между ними стали меняться. Базаров перестал говорить с Аркадием об Одинцовой, перестал даже бранить ее «аристократические замашки»; правда, Катю он хвалил по-прежнему и только советовал умерять в ней сентиментальные наклонности, но похвалы его были торопливы, советы сухи, и вообще он с Аркадием беседовал гораздо меньше прежнего… он как будто избегал, как будто стыдился его…","Time (a well-known thing) sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a worm; but it is especially good for a person when he does not even notice whether it is soon, whether it is quietly passing away. Arkady and Bazarov spent about fifteen days at Madame Odintsov's in this way. This was partly due to the order that she brought in her home and life. She adhered strictly to him and forced others to submit to him. Everything during the day was accomplished at a certain time. In the morning, exactly at eight o'clock, the whole party gathered for tea; from tea to breakfast, everyone did what he wanted, the hostess herself was busy with the clerk (the estate was on rent), with the butler, with the chief housekeeper. Before dinner the company again converged for conversation or for reading; the evening was dedicated to walking, maps, music; at half-past ten Anna Sergeevna went to her room, gave orders the next day and went to bed. Bazarov did not like this measured, somewhat solemn correctness of daily life; “As you roll on rails,” he assured: livery lackeys, dignified butlers insulted his democratic feeling. He thought that, for that matter, it ought to have dined in English, in tailcoats and white ties. He once explained this to Anna Sergeevna. She behaved herself in such a way that each person, without offense, expressed their opinions in front of her. She listened to him and said: “From your point of view, you are right, and perhaps in this case I am a lady; but one cannot live in disorder in a village, boredom will prevail ”, - and continued to do in her own way. Bazarov grumbled; but that is why it was so easy for him and Arkady at Madame Odintsova's, that everything in her house ""rolled like on rails."" With all this, in both young people, from the very first days of their stay in Nikolskoye, there was a change. In Bazarov, to whom Anna Sergeyevna obviously favored, although she rarely agreed with him, an unprecedented anxiety began to appear: he easily got irritated, spoke reluctantly, looked angrily and could not sit still, as if something was tempting him; and Arkady, who finally decided with himself that he was in love with Odintsov, began to indulge in quiet despondency. However, this despondency did not prevent him from getting closer to Katya; it even helped him to enter into an affectionate, friendly relationship with her. “She doesn't appreciate me! Let it! .. But a kind being does not reject me, ”he thought, and his heart again tasted the sweetness of generous sensations. Katya vaguely understood that he was looking for some kind of consolation in her company, and did not deny either him or herself the innocent pleasure of a half-shy, half-trusting friendship. In the presence of Anna Sergeevna they did not speak to each other: Katya always shrank under the watchful gaze of her sister, and Arkady, as it should be for a man in love, near his object could no longer pay attention to anything else; but he felt good with Katya alone. He felt that he could not occupy Madame Odintsov; he was shy and lost when he was alone with her; and she did not know what to say to him: he was too young for her. On the contrary, with Katya, Arkady was at home; he treated her condescendingly, did not prevent her from expressing the impressions aroused in her by music, reading stories, poems and other trifles, himself not noticing or not realizing that these trifles also occupied him. For her part, Katya did not prevent him from being sad. Arkady felt good with Katya, Odintsova with Bazarov, and therefore it usually happened like this: both couples, after spending a little time together, each parted in its own direction, especially during walks. Katya adored nature, and Arkady loved her, although he did not dare to admit it; Odintsova was rather indifferent to her, as was Bazarov. The almost constant separation of our friends did not remain without consequences: the relationship between them began to change. Bazarov stopped talking with Arkady about Madame Odintsova, he even stopped scolding her ""aristocratic manners""; True, he praised Katya as before and only advised her to moderate sentimental inclinations in her, but his praises were hasty, his advice was dry, and in general he talked to Arkady much less than before ... he seemed to avoid, as if he was ashamed of him ...","As we know, time either flies like a bird or crawls like a snail. Thus a man is in best case when he fails to notice either the rapidity or the slowness of its flight. Similarly did Bazarov and Arkady spend their fortnight at Madame Odintsov's. Of this another contributory cause was the fact that alike in her household and in her daily life she maintained a régime to which she herself strictly adhered, and to which she constrained others to adhere; so that the daily domestic round accomplished itself according to a fixed programme. At eight o'clock the company would assemble for breakfast; whereafter, until luncheon time, individuals could do whatsoever they chose (the hostess herself devoting her attention to her steward—she administered her estate on the obrok or tithes system—her household servants, and her head housekeeper). Next, before dinner, the company would reassemble for conversation or for reading aloud; and the rest of the evening would be devoted to a walk, to cards, or to music. Lastly, at half-past ten Anna Sergievna would withdraw to her room, issue her orders for the following day, and retire to bed. But to Bazarov this measured, slightly formal regularity was not wholly agreeable. "" Somehow it reminds one of running on a pair of rails,"" he used to declare; while so much did the sight of liveried lacqueys and graded serfs offend his democratic instincts that once he averred that one might as well dine in the English fashion outright, and wear white ties and black tail-coats. These views he expressed to Anna Sergievna (something in her always led men to lay bare their opinions in her presence); and, after she had heard him out, she said: ""From your point of view, the matter is as you say, and perhaps I play the fine lady too much; but in the country one cannot live anyhow; such a course always leads one to grow slovenly."" So she continued her régime as before. Yet, though Bazarov grumbled, he and Arkady found that to that very formality they owed the fact that everything in the establishment ""ran as on rails. "" In passing it may be mentioned that between the two young men there had taken place a change which dated from the day of their arrival at Nikolsköe, and manifested itself, as regards Bazarov (for whom Anna Sergievna evidently entertained a liking, though seldom did she agree with his dicta), in the form of an unwonted captiousness which led him easily to lose his temper, to speak always with reluctance, to glare about him, and to be as unable to sit still as though mines had been exploding beneath his seat. As for Arkady (now come finally to the conclusion that he was in love with Madame Odintsov), the change manifested itself, rather, in his falling a prey to a melancholy which in no way prevented him from making friends with Katia, and even helped him to maintain with her kindly and cordial relations. ""Whereas Madame cares nothing for me,"" he would reflect, ""this good-hearted creature does not give me the cold shoulder."" And these reflections would cause his heart to taste once more the sensuous joy of ""magnanimity."" Dimly Katia herself divined that her society afforded him a sort of comfort; wherefore she saw no reason to deny either him or herself the pleasure of this innocent, half-diffident, half-trustful camaraderie. True, in the presence, and under the keen eye, of the elder sister (who always caused Katia to retire precipitately into her shell) the pair never exchanged a single word (indeed, as a man in love, Arkady could not well have paid attention to any one but the object of his adoration while in the latter's vicinity); but as soon as he found himself alone with Katia he began, to a certain degree, really to enjoy himself. That is to say, whereas he knew himself to be incompetent to interest Madame (seeing that whenever he found himself alone with her he blushed and lost his head, while she, on her side, did not know what to say to him, so jejune was his mind as compared with her own), in Katia's presence he felt perfectly at home, and could treat her with condescension, and let her expound to him the impressions which she derived from music and the reading of tales, poems, and other ""trifles."" Nor did he notice, nor would he have consented to recognise had he noticed, the fact that those same ""trifles"" interested him as much as they did Katia. At the same time, the latter in no way acted as a clog upon his melancholy; wherefore, just as Madame was at her ease with Bazarov, so the young man was at his with Katia, and, after a short period of joint converse, the two couples would usually diverge. This happened especially during walks, and the more readily in that, whereas Katia adored nature, and Arkady too loved it (though he would never have admitted the fact), to Madame and Bazarov the charms of the natural world represented more or less a matter of indifference. Hardly need I add that from this constant separation between Arkady and Bazarov there flowed inevitable results which brought about in the relations of the pair a gradual change. That is to say, Bazarov ceased to discourse on Madame Odintsov—he ceased even to censure her for her ""aristocratic manners""; and while, with regard to Katia, he sang her praises as usual (at the same time advising the placing of a check upon her sentimental tendencies), he took to uttering these encomiums only in a half-hearted and a perfunctory way, and, in general, to lecturing his pupil less than he had formerly done. Rather, he seemed to avoid him, to feel in some way uncomfortable in his presence.","Time, it is well known, sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a worm; but man is wont to be particularly happy when he does not even notice whether it passes quickly or slowly. It was in that way Arkady and Bazarov spent a fortnight at Madame Odintsov's. The good order she had established in her house and in her life partly contributed to this result. She adhered strictly to this order herself, and forced others to submit to it. Everything during the day was done at a fixed time. In the morning, precisely at eight o'clock, all the party assembled for tea; from morning-tea till lunch-time every one did what he pleased, the hostess herself was engaged with her bailiff (the estate was on the rent-system), her steward, and her head housekeeper. Before dinner the party met again for conversation or reading; the evening was devoted to walking, cards, and music; at half-past ten Anna Sergyevna retired to her own room, gave her orders for the following day, and went to bed. Bazarov did not like this measured, somewhat ostentatious punctuality in daily life, 'like moving along rails,' he pronounced it to be; the footmen in livery, the decorous stewards, offended his democratic sentiments. He declared that if one went so far, one might as well dine in the English style at once—in tail-coats and white ties. He once spoke plainly upon the subject to Anna Sergyevna. Her attitude was such that no one hesitated to speak his mind freely before her. She heard him out; and then her comment was, 'From your point of view, you are right—and perhaps, in that respect, I am too much of a lady; but there's no living in the country without order, one would be devoured by ennui,' and she continued to go her own way. Bazarov grumbled, but the very reason life was so easy for him and Arkady at Madame Odintsov's was that everything in the house 'moved on rails.' For all that, a change had taken place in both the young men since the first days of their stay at Nikolskoe. Bazarov, in whom Anna Sergyevna was obviously interested, though she seldom agreed with him, began to show signs of an unrest, unprecedented in him; he was easily put out of temper, and unwilling to talk, he looked irritated, and could not sit still in one place, just as though he were possessed by some secret longing; while Arkady, who had made up his mind conclusively that he was in love with Madame Odintsov, had begun to yield to a gentle melancholy. This melancholy did not, however, prevent him from becoming friendly with Katya; it even impelled him to get into friendly, affectionate terms with her. ' She does not appreciate me? So be it!... But here is a good creature, who does not repulse me,' he thought, and his heart again knew the sweetness of magnanimous emotions. Katya vaguely realised that he was seeking a sort of consolation in her company, and did not deny him or herself the innocent pleasure of a half-shy, half-confidential friendship. They did not talk to each other in Anna Sergyevna's presence; Katya always shrank into herself under her sister's sharp eyes; while Arkady, as befits a man in love, could pay attention to nothing else when near the object of his passion; but he was happy with Katya alone. He was conscious that he did not possess the power to interest Madame Odintsov; he was shy and at a loss when he was left alone with her, and she did not know what to say to him, he was too young for her. With Katya, on the other hand, Arkady felt at home; he treated her condescendingly, encouraged her to express the impressions made on her by music, reading novels, verses, and other such trifles, without noticing or realising that these trifles were what interested him too. Katya, on her side, did not try to drive away melancholy. Arkady was at his ease with Katya, Madame Odintsov with Bazarov, and thus it usually came to pass that the two couples, after being a little while together, went off on their separate ways, especially during the walks. Katya adored nature, and Arkady loved it, though he did not dare to acknowledge it ; Madame Odintsov was, like Bazarov, rather indifferent to the beauties of nature. The almost continual separation of the two friends was not without its consequences; the relations between them began to change. Bazarov gave up talking to Arkady about Madame Odintsov, gave up even abusing her 'aristocratic ways'; Katya, it is true, he praised as before, and only advised him to restrain her sentimental tendencies, but his praises were hurried, his advice dry, and in general he talked less to Arkady than before ... he seemed to avoid him, seemed ill at ease with him.","It’s a known fact that time sometimes flies like a bird and sometimes creeps along like a worm. But it’s best for a man if he doesn’t notice whether it’s passing quickly or slowly. That’s how Arkady and Bazarov spent a fortnight at Odintsova’s. It was partly helped by the order she had established in the house and in her life. She maintained it rigidly and made others observe it. Everything during the day took place at a known time. In the morning, at eight precisely, the whole company gathered for tea. From tea till lunch everyone did what he wanted while the hostess was busy with her steward (the estate was run on a quit-rent basis), her butler and her head housekeeper. Before dinner the company assembled again to talk or read. The evenings were given over to walking, cards and music. At half past ten Anna Sergeyevna withdrew to her room, gave her orders for the following day and went to bed. Bazarov didn’t like this measured, slightly formal regularity of everyday life; he claimed, ‘It’s as if you were going along on rails’: liveried footmen and dignified butlers offended his democratic sensibility. He found that if things had gone that far, they might as well sit down to dinner like the English, in white tie and tails. He once had it out with Anna Sergeyevna on this subject. Her way of behaving was such that anyone would be quite open about what they thought in front of her. She heard him out and said, ‘From your point of view you are right – and maybe in this case I am playing the grand lady. But one can’t live in the country without order; otherwise one would be overcome by boredom.’ And she went on acting in her own way. Bazarov grumbled, but the reason that he and Arkady had such a comfortable time at Odintsova’s was because everything in her house ‘went along as if it was on rails’. With all this a change took place in both young men from the very first days of their stay at Nikolskoye. Bazarov, whom Anna Sergeyevna clearly liked though she seldom agreed with him, felt a sense of disquiet he hadn’t had before: he was easily irritated, was reluctant to talk, looked angrily about him and couldn’t sit still, as if something were nagging him. And Arkady, who had finally decided he was in love with Anna Sergeyevna, began to indulge in quiet despair. However, this despair didn’t prevent him from becoming close to Katya: it even helped him to be on affectionate and friendly terms with her. ‘ She doesn’t appreciate me! So that’s that!… But here is a kind being who doesn’t reject me,’ he thought, and his heart again tasted the pleasure of high-minded generosity. Katya dimly felt he was seeking some kind of solace in her company, and didn’t deny either him or herself the innocent pleasure of a friendship that was both timid and trusting. In front of Anna Sergeyevna they didn’t speak to one another: Katya always shrank under her sister’s sharp eyes, and Arkady – as is right for a man in love – when he was near the object of his love, couldn’t pay attention to anything else. But he was at ease with Katya on her own. He felt it was beyond his power to engage Anna Sergeyevna’s interest; he was shy and became flustered when he was alone with her; and she didn’t know what to say to him; he was too young for her. On the other hand with Katya Arkady felt at home; he was indulgent with her and didn’t stop her sharing with him what she had learnt from music, reading novels, poetry and other nonsense, without himself noticing or acknowledging that this nonsense interested him. For her part Katya didn’t stop his melancholy pose. Arkady felt good in Katya’s company, and Anna Sergeyevna in Bazarov’s, and so it usually happened that after a short time together both couples would go off by themselves, especially during their walks. Katya adored nature, and Arkady liked nature too although he didn’t dare admit it. Anna Sergeyevna was fairly indifferent to nature, like Bazarov. Since now our friends were apart almost the whole time, that too had consequences: their relationship started to change. Bazarov stopped talking to Arkady about Odintsova, he even stopped criticizing her ‘aristocratic little ways’. It’s true he continued to praise Katya and only advised Arkady to control her tendency towards sentimentality, but his praise was cursory and his advice stiff. In general he chatted to Arkady much less than before… as if he were avoiding him, were ashamed of him…"

"Фенечка опять засмеялась и даже руками всплеснула, до того ей показалось забавным желание Базарова. Она смеялась и в то же время чувствовала себя польщенною. Базаров пристально смотрел на нее.","Fenechka laughed again and even threw up her hands, so much so she thought Bazarov's desire was amusing. She laughed and at the same time felt flattered. Bazarov gazed at her intently.","She burst into a peal of laughter, and clapped her hands with delight at the request. Yet the laughter was accompanied with a certain sense of relief. Bazarov eyed her.","Fenitchka laughed again, and even clapped her hands, so amusing Bazarov's request seemed to her. She laughed, and at the same time felt flattered. Bazarov was looking intently at her.",Fenechka again burst out laughing and even gestured with her hands. She found Bazarov’s wish so funny. She laughed and at the same time felt herself flattered. Bazarov looked fixedly at her.
"Это случилось в начале 48-го года, в то самое время, когда Николай Петрович, лишившись жены, приезжал в Петербург. Павел Петрович почти не видался с братом с тех пор, как тот поселился в деревне: свадьба Николая Петровича совпала с самыми первыми днями знакомства Павла Петровича с княгиней. Вернувшись из-за границы, он отправился к нему с намерением погостить у него месяца два, полюбоваться его счастием, но выжил у него одну только неделю. Различие в положении обоих братьев было слишком велико. В 48-м году это различие уменьшилось: Николай Петрович потерял жену, Павел Петрович потерял свои воспоминания; после смерти княгини он старался не думать о ней. Но у Николая оставалось чувство правильно проведенной жизни, сын вырастал на его глазах; Павел, напротив, одинокий холостяк, вступал в то смутное, сумеречное время, время сожалений, похожих на надежды, надежд, похожих на сожаления, когда молодость прошла, а старость еще не настала.","This happened at the beginning of 1948, at the very time when Nikolai Petrovich, having lost his wife, came to Petersburg. Pavel Petrovich hardly saw his brother since he settled in the village: Nikolai Petrovich's wedding coincided with the very first days of Pavel Petrovich's acquaintance with the princess. Returning from abroad, he went to him with the intention of staying with him for two months, to admire his happiness, but survived with him only one week. The difference in the position of the two brothers was too great. In 1948 this difference diminished: Nikolai Petrovich lost his wife, Pavel Petrovich lost his memories; after the death of the princess, he tried not to think about her. But Nicholas still had a sense of a well-spent life, his son was growing up in front of his eyes; Pavel, on the other hand, a lonely bachelor, entered that troubled, twilight time, a time of regrets similar to hopes, hopes similar to regrets, when youth had passed and old age had not yet arrived.","""These things took place just at the time (early in '48) when Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife, and removed to St. Petersburg; and since, also, the period of Nikolai's marriage had coincided with the earlier days of Paul's acquaintance with the Princess, Paul had not seen his brother since the day when the latter had settled in the country. True, on returning from abroad, Paul had paid Nikolai a visit with the intention of staying with him for a couple of months, as a congratulatory compliment on his happiness; but the visit had lasted a week only, since the difference in the position of the two brothers had been too great, and even now, though that difference had diminished somewhat, owing to the fact that Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife, and Paul Petrovitch his memories (after the Princess's death he made it his rule to try and forget her)—even now, I say, there existed the difference that, whereas Nikolai Petrovitch could look back upon a life well spent, and had a son rising to manhood, Paul Petrovitch was still a lonely bachelor, and, moreover, entering upon that dim, murky period when regrets come to resemble hopes, and hopes are beginning to resemble regrets, and youth is fled, and old age is fast approaching.","This happened at the beginning of the year 1848, at the very time when Nikolai Petrovitch came to Petersburg, after the loss of his wife. Pavel Petrovitch had scarcely seen his brother since the latter had settled in the country; the marriage of Nikolai Petrovitch had coincided with the very first days of Pavel Petrovitch's acquaintance with the princess. When he came back from abroad, he had gone to him with the intention of staying a couple of months with him, in sympathetic enjoyment of his happiness, but he had only succeeded in standing a week of it. The difference in the positions of the two brothers was too great. In 1848, this difference had grown less; Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife, Pavel Petrovitch had lost his memories; after the death of the princess he tried not to think of her. But to Nikolai, there remained the sense of a well-spent life, his son was growing up under his eyes; Pavel, on the contrary, a solitary bachelor, was entering upon that indefinite twilight period of regrets that are akin to hopes, and hopes that are akin to regrets, when youth is over, while old age has not yet come.","This happened in 1848, at the very time when Nikolay Petrovich, having lost his wife, was coming to St Petersburg. Pavel Petrovich had hardly seen his brother since he’d been living in the country: Nikolay Petrovich’s marriage coincided with the very first days of Pavel Petrovich’s relationship with the princess. When he came back from abroad, Pavel Petrovich went to his brother’s with the intention of staying with him a couple of months, to enjoy his happiness, but he only lasted a week with him. The difference in the two brothers’ situation was too great. In 1848 this difference became less: Nikolay Petrovich had lost his wife, Pavel Petrovich had lost his memories; after the princess’s death he tried not to think of her.

Pavel on the other hand was a lonely bachelor and was coming to that troubled twilight time, a time of regrets that resemble hopes, of hopes that resemble regrets, when youth is past but old age has not yet come."

"Полчаса спустя Николай Петрович отправился в сад, в свою любимую беседку. На него нашли грустные думы. Впервые он ясно сознал свое разъединение с сыном; он предчувствовал, что с каждым днем оно будет становиться все больше и больше. Стало быть, напрасно он, бывало, зимою в Петербурге по целым дням просиживал над новейшими сочинениями; напрасно прислушивался к разговорам молодых людей; напрасно радовался, когда ему удавалось вставить и свое слово в их кипучие речи. «Брат говорит, что мы правы, – думал он, – и, отложив всякое самолюбие в сторону, мне самому кажется, что они дальше от истины, нежели мы, а в то же время я чувствую, что за ними есть что-то, чего мы не имеем, какое-то преимущество над нами… Молодость? Нет: не одна только молодость. Не в том ли состоит это преимущество, что в них меньше следов барства, чем в нас?»","Half an hour later Nikolai Petrovich went to the garden, to his favorite arbor. Sad thoughts found him. For the first time, he was clearly aware of his separation from his son; he had a presentiment that every day it would become more and more. Consequently, it was in vain that he used to sit for whole days in Petersburg in winter over the newest works; in vain he listened to the conversations of young people; in vain he rejoiced when he managed to insert his own word into their ebullient speeches. “My brother says that we are right,” he thought, “and putting all self-esteem aside, it seems to me that they are further from the truth than we are, and at the same time I feel that there is something behind them, what we do not have, some advantage over us ... Youth? No: not only youth. Isn't this advantage that they have less traces of lordship than us? ""","Half an hour later Nikolai Petrovitch sought his favourite arbour. Despondent thoughts were thronging through his brain, for the rift between himself and his son was only too evident. Also, he knew that that rift would widen from day to day. For nothing had he spent whole days, during those winters in St. Petersburg, in the perusal of modern works! For nothing had he listened to the young men's discourses! For nothing had he been delighted when he had been able to interpolate a word into their tempestuous debates! ""My brother says that we are more in the right than they,"" he reflected. "" And certainly I too can say without vanity that I believe these young fellows to stand at a greater distance from the truth than ourselves. Yet also I believe that they have in them something which we lack—something which gives them an advantage over us. What is that something? Is it youth? No, it is not youth alone. Is it that there hovers about them less of the barin than hovers about ourselves? Possibly!""","Half an hour later Nikolai Petrovitch went into the garden to his favourite arbour. He was overtaken by melancholy thoughts. For the first time he realised clearly the distance between him and his son; he foresaw that every day it would grow wider and wider. In vain, then, had he spent whole days sometimes in the winter at Petersburg over the newest books; in vain had he listened to the talk of the young men; in vain had he rejoiced when he succeeded in putting in his word too in their heated discussions. ' My brother says we are right,' he thought, 'and apart from all vanity, I do think myself that they are further from the truth than we are, though at the same time I feel there is something behind them we have not got, some superiority over us.... Is it youth? No; not only youth. Doesn't their superiority consist in there being fewer traces of the slaveowner in them than in us?'","Half an hour later Nikolay Petrovich went into the garden, to his favourite arbour. His thoughts were gloomy. For the first time he recognized how far he and his son had grown apart. He foresaw that with every day the distance between them would become greater and greater. So there had been no point in his having spent whole days during those winters in St Petersburg poring over the most recent publications; no point in his listening carefully to the conversations of the young; no point in his pleasure at getting a word in during their heated discussions. ‘My brother says we are right,’ he thought, ‘and setting all vanity aside , I do myself think they are further from the truth than we are, but at the same time I feel they have something which we don’t, some advantage over us… Youth?

"Павел Петрович остался один и на этот раз с особенным вниманием оглянулся кругом. Небольшая, низенькая комнатка, в которой он находился, была очень чиста и уютна. В ней пахло недавно выкрашенным полом, ромашкой и мелиссой. Вдоль стен стояли стулья с задками в виде лир; они были куплены еще покойником генералом в Польше, во время похода; в одном углу возвышалась кроватка под кисейным пологом, рядом с кованым сундуком с круглою крышкой. В противоположном углу горела лампадка перед большим темным образом Николая чудотворца; крошечное фарфоровое яичко на красной ленте висело на груди святого, прицепленное к сиянию; на окнах банки с прошлогодним вареньем, тщательно завязанные, сквозили зеленым светом; на бумажных их крышках сама Фенечка написала крупными буквами «кружовник»; Николай Петрович любил особенно это варенье. Под потолком, на длинном шнурке, висела клетка с короткохвостым чижом; он беспрестанно чирикал и прыгал, и клетка беспрестанно качалась и дрожала: конопляные зерна с легким стуком падали на пол. В простенке, над небольшим комодом, висели довольно плохие фотографические портреты Николая Петровича в разных положениях, сделанные заезжим художником; тут же висела фотография самой Фенечки, совершенно не удавшаяся: какое-то безглазое лицо напряженно улыбалось в темной рамочке, – больше ничего нельзя было разобрать; а над Фенечкой – Ермолов,[36] в бурке, грозно хмурился на отдаленные Кавказские горы из-под шелкового башмачка для булавок, падавшего ему на самый лоб.","Pavel Petrovich was left alone and this time looked around with particular attention. The small, low room he was in was very clean and comfortable. It smelled of freshly painted floors, chamomile and lemon balm. Along the walls were chairs with lyre-shaped backs; they were bought by a deceased general in Poland, during a campaign; in one corner stood a crib under a muslin canopy, next to a wrought-iron chest with a round lid. In the opposite corner a lamp burned in front of a large dark image of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker; a tiny porcelain egg on a red ribbon hung on the saint's chest, attached to the radiance; on the windows, jars of last year's jam, carefully tied, shone with green light; on their paper covers, Fenichka herself wrote in large letters ""circlet""; Nikolai Petrovich especially loved this jam. A cage with a short-tailed siskin hung from the ceiling on a long cord; he chirped and jumped incessantly, and the cage incessantly swayed and trembled: the hemp seeds fell to the floor with a light thud. In the pier, above a small chest of drawers, hung rather poor photographic portraits of Nikolai Petrovich in different positions, made by a visiting artist; right there hung a photograph of Fenichka herself, which was completely unsuccessful: some eyeless face was smiling intensely in a dark frame — nothing else could be made out; and over Fenechka - Ermolov, [36] in a burka, menacingly frowned at the distant Caucasus mountains from under a silk shoe for pins that fell on his forehead.","Left alone, Paul looked about him with keen attention. The small, low room in which he was waiting was clean and comfortable, and redolent of balm, camomile, and furniture polish. Against the walls stood straight-backed, lyre-shaped chairs which the late General had purchased during the period of the Polish campaign; in one corner stood a bedstead under a muslin coverlet, with, flanking it, a large, iron-clamped, convex-lidded chest; in the opposite corner burnt a lamp before a massive, smoke-blackened ikon of Saint Nikolai the Miracle Worker—the Saint's halo suspended by a red riband, and a tiny china egg resting on his breast; on the window-sills were ranged some carefully sealed jars of last year's jam, which filtered the light to green, and of which the parchment covers were inscribed, in Thenichka's large handwriting, ""Gooseberry""—a jam of which Nikolai Petrovitch was particularly fond; from the ceiling hung, by a long cord, a cage containing a short-tailed siskin which kept up such a perpetual twittering and hopping that its cage rocked to and fro as it sang, and stray hemp seeds came pattering lightly to the floor; on the wall space above a small chest of drawers hung a few poorly executed photographs of Nikolai Petrovitch in various attitudes (the work of a travelling photographer); alongside these photographs hung a very unsuccessful one of Thenichka herself, since it revealed nothing but an eyeless face peering painfully from a dark frame; and, lastly, above the portrait of Thenichka hung a picture of Ermolov in a big cloak and a portentous frown—the latter directed principally towards a distant mountain range of the Caucasus, while over the forehead of the portrait dangled a silken pincushion in the shape of a shoe.","Pavel Petrovitch was left alone, and he looked round this time with special attention. The small low-pitched room in which he found himself was very clean and snug. It smelt of the freshly painted floor and of camomile. Along the walls stood chairs with lyre-shaped backs, bought by the late general on his campaign in Poland; in one corner was a little bedstead under a muslin canopy beside an iron-clamped chest with a convex lid. In the opposite corner a little lamp was burning before a big dark picture of St. Nikolai the wonder-worker; a tiny porcelain egg hung by a red ribbon from the protruding gold halo down to the saint's breast ; by the windows greenish glass jars of last year's jam carefully tied down could be seen; on their paper covers Fenitchka herself had written in big letters 'Gooseberry'; Nikolai Petrovitch was particularly fond of that preserve. On a long cord from the ceiling a cage hung with a short-tailed siskin in it; he was constantly chirping and hopping about, the cage was constantly shaking and swinging, while hempseeds fell with a light tap on to the floor. On the wall just above a small chest of drawers hung some rather bad photographs of Nikolai Petrovitch in various attitudes, taken by an itinerant photographer; there too hung a photograph of Fenitchka herself, which was an absolute failure; it was an eyeless face wearing a forced smile, in a dingy frame, nothing more could be made out; while above Fenitchka, General Yermolov, in a Circassian cloak, scowled menacingly upon the Caucasian mountains in the distance, from beneath a little silk shoe for pins which fell right on to his brows.","Pavel Petrovich was alone and this time he looked round with particular attention. The small, low-ceilinged room in which he was standing was very clean and comfortable. It smelt of new varnish on the floor, of camomile and lemon balm. Chairs with lyre-shaped backs stood along the walls; they had been bought by the late general in Poland, during the campaign against Napoleon. In one corner rose a bed under a muslin curtain, next to an iron-bound trunk with a domed lid. In the opposite corner a lamp was burning in front of a big dark icon of St Nicholas the Thaumaturge;3 a tiny china egg hung on the saint’s breast, attached to his halo by a red ribbon. On the window-sills stood glass jars of last year’s jam, green and translucent, and carefully sealed; Fenechka herself had written ‘goozberry’ in big letters on their paper covers; it was Nikolay Petrovich’s favourite jam. A cage with a short-tailed siskin hung from the ceiling; the bird never stopped hopping and twittering, and the cage never stopped shaking and trembling; seeds of hemp pattered on the floor. Between the windows, above a small chest of drawers, hung some rather poor photographic portraits of Nikolay Petrovich in various poses, taken by an itinerant photographer; there too hung a photograph of Fenechka herself, which was extremely unsuccessful: a face with no eyes giving a strained smile in a dark frame – that was all one could make out. Above Fenechka, Yermolov4 in a Circassian cloak was frowning menacingly at the distant mountains of the Caucasus, glaring from under a silk pin-holder that had slipped right down his forehead."

In fact, though she confined herself, in the drawing-room or the dining-room, to sulking, she resorted, when alone with her maid in the bedroom, to abuse of Arkady and Bazarov which made her cap and her false front fairly dance on her head. These things, of course, Madame Odintsov knew.","On the evening of the same day, Madame Odintsov was sitting in her own room with Bazarov, while Arkady walked up and down the hall listening to Katya's playing.

"– Э-э! да ты, я вижу, точно, намерен пойти по стопам дядюшки. Как бы этот идиот порадовался, если б услышал тебя!","- Uh! Yes, you, I see, definitely intend to follow in the footsteps of your uncle. How happy this idiot would be if he heard you!","I perceive you still to be minded to follow in your uncle's footsteps. How the idiot would have rejoiced if he could have heard you!""","you really do intend, I see, to walk in your uncle's footsteps. How pleased that worthy imbecile would have been if he had heard you!'",‘Hey! I see you are really set on following in your uncle’s footsteps. How pleased that idiot would be if he heard you!’
"Утро было славное, свежее; маленькие пестрые тучки стояли барашками на бледно-ясной лазури; мелкая роса высыпала на листьях и травах, блистала серебром на паутинках; влажная, темная земля, казалось, еще хранила румяный след зари; со всего неба сыпались песни жаворонков. Базаров дошел до рощи, присел в тени на опушку и только тогда открыл Петру, какой он ждал от него услуги. Образованный лакей перепугался насмерть; но Базаров успокоил его уверением, что ему другого нечего будет делать, как только стоять в отдалении да глядеть, и что ответственности он не подвергается никакой. «А между тем, – прибавил он, – подумай, какая предстоит тебе важная роль!» Петр развел руками, потупился и, весь зеленый, прислонился к березе.","The morning was glorious, fresh; small motley clouds stood like lambs on the pale clear azure; fine dew poured out on the leaves and grasses, shone silver on the cobwebs; the damp, dark earth, it seemed, still retained the ruddy trail of dawn; songs of larks rained down from all over the sky. Bazarov reached the grove, sat down in the shade on the edge of the forest, and only then revealed to Peter what kind of service he expected from him. The educated footman was terrified to death; but Bazarov reassured him with the assurance that he would have nothing else to do but stand at a distance and gaze, and that he was not subject to any responsibility. ""Meanwhile,"" he added, ""think what an important role you have!"" Peter threw up his hands, looked down and, all green, leaned against the birch.","The morning was fine and fresh, and though a few wisps of cloud were trailing across the pale-blue transparency of the zenith, a light dew had coated the grass and foliage with drops, and was shining like silver on spiders' webs. The steaming earth seemed still to be seeking to detain the roseate traces of dawn in her embrace; but presently every quarter of the sky became lit up, and resounded again to the songs of larks. Bazarov walked straight ahead until he reached the copse—then seated himself at the shadowy edge of the trees, and explained to Peter the services which he looked to the latter to perform; upon which the ""cultured"" menial came near to fainting, and was calmed only with an assurance that he would but have to stand at a distance, as a looker-on, and that in no case would responsibility attach to his person. ""And think,"" Bazarov concluded, ""in what an important rôle you are about to figure!"" But Peter, extending his hands deprecatingly, only turned up his eyes, became green in the face, and went and leant against a birch tree.","It was a lovely, fresh morning; tiny flecked clouds hovered overhead in little curls of foam on the pale clear blue; a fine dew lay in drops on the leaves and grass, and sparkled like silver on the spiders' webs; the damp, dark earth seemed still to keep traces of the rosy dawn; from the whole sky the songs of larks came pouring in showers. Bazarov walked as far as the copse, sat down in the shade at its edge, and only then disclosed to Piotr the nature of the service he expected of him. The refined valet was mortally alarmed; but Bazarov soothed him by the assurance that he would have nothing to do but stand at a distance and look on, and that he would not incur any sort of responsibility. ' And meantime,' he added, 'only think what an important part you have to play!' Piotr threw up his hands, looked down, and leaned against a birch-tree, looking green with terror.","It was a lovely fresh morning. The pale, clear azure of the sky was dappled with little fleecy clouds. A light dew had fallen on the leaves and grass and shone silver on the spider webs. The moist, dark earth seemed to hold the rosy traces of sunrise. The whole sky rang with the song of larks. Bazarov went as far as the wood, sat down at its edge and only then disclosed to Pyotr the service he required of him. The well-trained servant was mortally scared, but Bazarov calmed him with the assurance that he had nothing to do but to stand at a distance and watch, and that he wasn’t exposed to any responsibility. ‘ And then,’ he added,’ just think what an important role you’ll have!’ Pyotr made a gesture with his hands, lowered his eyes and leant against a birch tree, looking green."
"Аркадий ощущал на сердце некоторую робость, когда при первых звуках мазурки он усаживался возле своей дамы и, готовясь вступить в разговор, только проводил рукой по волосам и не находил ни единого слова. Но он робел и волновался недолго; спокойствие Одинцовой сообщилось и ему: четверти часа не прошло, как уж он свободно рассказывал о своем отце, дяде, о жизни в Петербурге и в деревне. Одинцова слушала его с вежливым участием, слегка раскрывая и закрывая веер; болтовня его прерывалась, когда ее выбирали кавалеры; Ситников, между прочим, пригласил ее два раза. Она возвращалась, садилась снова, брала веер, и даже грудь ее не дышала быстрее, а Аркадий опять принимался болтать, весь проникнутый счастием находиться в ее близости, говорить с ней, глядя в ее глаза, в ее прекрасный лоб, во все ее милое, важное и умное лицо. Сама она говорила мало, но знание жизни сказывалось в ее словах; по иным ее замечаниям Аркадий заключил, что эта молодая женщина уже успела перечувствовать и передумать многое…","Arkady felt a certain shyness in his heart when, at the first sounds of the mazurka, he sat down next to his lady and, preparing to enter into a conversation, only ran his hand through his hair and did not find a single word. But he was shy and worried not for long; Madame Odintsova's calmness communicated to him too: less than a quarter of an hour had passed, he was already talking freely about his father, uncle, about life in Petersburg and in the countryside. Madame Odintsov listened to him with polite sympathy, slightly opening and closing her fan; his chatter was interrupted when she was chosen by her gentlemen; Sitnikov, by the way, invited her twice. She came back, sat down again, took the fan, and even her chest did not breathe faster, and Arkady again began to chat, all imbued with happiness to be in her closeness, talking to her, looking into her eyes, into her beautiful forehead, into all her dear, important and intelligent person. She herself spoke little, but the knowledge of life was reflected in her words; according to her other comments, Arkady concluded that this young woman had already managed to feel and change her mind a lot ...","Nevertheless, when the strains of the mazurka struck up, and, reseating himself beside his partner, he prepared to enter into conversation with her, he felt a distinct touch of diffidence. Nor, though he kept passing his hand over his hair, could he find a word to say. However, this timidity, this state of agitation, did not last long, for soon her calmness infected him, and within a quarter of an hour he was talking to her of his father, his uncle, and life in St. Petersburg and the country. For her part, she listened with kindly interest, while gently opening and closing her fan. Thus only at moments when other cavaliers came to ask her for dances (Sitnikov did this twice) did Arkady's chatter become interrupted; and whenever she returned to her place, to reseat herself with her bosom heaving not a whit more rapidly than it had done before, he would plunge into renewed conversation, so delighted was he at the fact that he had found some one to sympathise with him, to whom he could talk, at whose beautiful eyes and forehead and gentle, refined, intellectual features he could gaze at leisure. She herself said little, but her every word showed a knowledge of life which pointed to the fact that already this young woman had thought and felt much.","Arkady felt some timidity in his heart when at the first sounds of the mazurka he began to sit it out beside his partner; he had prepared to enter into a conversation with her, but he only passed his hand through his hair, and could not find a single word to say.

Madame Odintsov listened to him with courteous sympathy, slightly opening and closing her fan; his talk was broken off when partners came for her; Sitnikov, among others, twice asked her. She came back, sat down again, took up her fan, and her bosom did not even heave more rapidly, while Arkady fell to chattering again, filled through and through by the happiness of being near her, talking to her, looking at her eyes, her lovely brow, all her sweet, dignified, clever face. She said little, but her words showed a knowledge of life; from some of her observations Arkady gathered that this young woman had already felt and thought much....","When the first sounds of the mazurka struck up and Arkady sat down beside his partner, he felt a bit shy inside himself and, as he tried to make conversation, he just stroked his hair and couldn’t come up with a single word.

In less than a quarter of an hour he was freely talking about his father, his uncle, life in St Petersburg and in the country. Odintsova listened to him with polite interest, slightly opening and closing her fan. His talk was interrupted when her partners called her out. (Sitnikov asked her twice.) She came back, sat down again and took up her fan, not even out of breath, and Arkady resumed his chatter, full of the happiness of being near her, of talking to her, looking into her eyes, at her noble brow, at her whole attractive, serious and intelligent face.

From a number of her remarks Arkady concluded that this young woman had managed to acquire a great deal of experience in her emotions and her thoughts…"

"Зовут его Николаем Петровичем Кирсановым. У него в пятнадцати верстах от постоялого дворика хорошее имение в двести душ, или, как он выражается с тех пор, как размежевался с крестьянами и завел «ферму», – в две тысячи десятин земли. Отец его, боевой генерал 1812 года, полуграмотный, грубый, но не злой русский человек, всю жизнь свою тянул лямку, командовал сперва бригадой, потом дивизией и постоянно жил в провинции, где в силу своего чина играл довольно значительную роль. Николай Петрович родился на юге России, подобно старшему своему брату Павлу, о котором речь впереди, и воспитывался до четырнадцатилетнего возраста дома, окруженный дешевыми гувернерами, развязными, но подобострастными адъютантами и прочими полковыми и штабными личностями. Родительница его, из фамилии Колязиных, в девицах Agathe, а в генеральшах Агафоклея Кузьминишна Кирсанова, принадлежала к числу «матушек-командирш», носила пышные чепцы и шумные шелковые платья, в церкви подходила первая ко кресту, говорила громко и много, допускала детей утром к ручке, на ночь их благословляла, – словом, жила в свое удовольствие. В качестве генеральского сына Николай Петрович – хотя не только не отличался храбростью, но даже заслужил прозвище трусишки – должен был, подобно брату Павлу, поступить в военную службу; но он переломил себе ногу в самый тот день, когда уже прибыло известие об его определении, и, пролежав два месяца в постели, на всю жизнь остался «хроменьким». Отец махнул на него рукой и пустил его по штатской. Он повез его в Петербург, как только ему минул восемнадцатый год, и поместил его в университет. Кстати, брат его о ту пору вышел офицером в гвардейский полк. Молодые люди стали жить вдвоем, на одной квартире, под отдаленным надзором двоюродного дяди с материнской стороны, Ильи Колязина, важного чиновника. Отец их вернулся к своей дивизии и к своей супруге и лишь изредка присылал сыновьям большие четвертушки серой бумаги, испещренные размашистым писарским почерком. На конце этих четвертушек красовались старательно окруженные «выкрутасами» слова: «Пиотр Кирсаноф, генерал-майор». В 1835 году Николай Петрович вышел из университета кандидатом,[1] и в том же году генерал Кирсанов, уволенный в отставку за неудачный смотр, приехал в Петербург с женою на житье. Он нанял было дом у Таврического сада и записался в Английский клуб,[2] но внезапно умер от удара. Агафоклея Кузьминишна скоро за ним последовала: она не могла привыкнуть к глухой столичной жизни; тоска отставного существованья ее загрызла. Между тем Николай Петрович успел, еще при жизни родителей и к немалому их огорчению, влюбиться в дочку чиновника Преполовенского, бывшего хозяина его квартиры, миловидную и, как говорится, развитую девицу: она в журналах читала серьезные статьи в отделе «Наук». Он женился на ней, как только минул срок траура, и, покинув министерство уделов, куда по протекции отец его записал, блаженствовал со своею Машей сперва на даче около Лесного института, потом в городе, в маленькой и хорошенькой квартире, с чистою лестницей и холодноватою гостиной, наконец – в деревне, где он поселился окончательно и где у него в скором времени родился сын Аркадий. Супруги жили очень хорошо и тихо: они почти никогда не расставались, читали вместе, играли в четыре руки на фортепьяно, пели дуэты; она сажала цветы и наблюдала за птичным двором, он изредка ездил на охоту и занимался хозяйством, а Аркадий рос да рос – тоже хорошо и тихо. Десять лет прошло как сон. В 47-м году жена Кирсанова скончалась. Он едва вынес этот удар, поседел в несколько недель; собрался было за границу, чтобы хотя немного рассеяться… но тут настал 48-й год.[3] Он поневоле вернулся в деревню и после довольно продолжительного бездействия занялся хозяйственными преобразованиями. В 55-м году он повез сына в университет; прожил с ним три зимы в Петербурге, почти никуда не выходя и стараясь заводить знакомства с молодыми товарищами Аркадия. На последнюю зиму он приехать не мог, – и вот мы видим его в мае месяце 1859 года, уже совсем седого, пухленького и немного сгорбленного: он ждет сына, получившего, как некогда он сам, звание кандидата.","His name is Nikolai Petrovich Kirsanov. He has a good estate fifteen miles from the inn, two hundred souls, or, as he puts it since he dissociated himself from the peasants and started a ""farm,"" - two thousand acres of land. His father, a military general in 1812, a semi-literate, rude, but not evil Russian man, pulled the strap all his life, commanded first a brigade, then a division and constantly lived in the provinces, where, due to his rank, he played a rather significant role. Nikolai Petrovich was born in the south of Russia, like his elder brother Pavel, about whom we will speak later, and was brought up until the age of fourteen at home, surrounded by cheap governors, cheeky but obsequious adjutants and other regimental and staff personalities. His parent, from the surname of the Kolyazins, in the girls Agathe, and in the generals of Agafoklei Kuzminishna Kirsanova, belonged to the number of ""mothers-commanders"", wore lush caps and noisy silk dresses, in church she was the first to approach the cross, spoke loudly and a lot, allowed children in the morning to the pen, blessed them at night - in a word, she lived for her own pleasure. As a general's son, Nikolai Petrovich - although not only did not differ in courage, but even earned the nickname of a coward - had to, like his brother Pavel, enter the military service; but he broke his leg on the very day when the news of his appointment had already arrived, and, after lying in bed for two months, remained ""lame"" for the rest of his life. Father waved his hand at him and sent him into civilian clothes. He took him to Petersburg as soon as he passed the eighteenth year, and placed him at the university. By the way, about that time, his brother came out as an officer in the guards regiment. Young people began to live together, in the same apartment, under the remote supervision of a great-uncle on the maternal side, Ilya Kolyazin, an important official. Their father returned to his division and to his wife, and only occasionally sent his sons large quarters of gray paper, mottled with sweeping clerical handwriting. At the end of these quarters were the words diligently surrounded by ""freaks"": ""Piotr Kirsanof, Major General."" In 1835 Nikolai Petrovich left the university as a candidate, [1] and in the same year General Kirsanov, dismissed for an unsuccessful review, came to St. Petersburg with his wife to live. He rented a house near the Tauride Garden and enrolled in the English Club, [2] but died suddenly of a stroke. Agafoklea Kuzminishna soon followed him: she could not get used to the deaf metropolitan life; the longing of a retired existence gnawed at her. Meanwhile, Nikolai Petrovich managed, while his parents were still alive and much to their chagrin, to fall in love with the daughter of the official Prepolovensky, the former owner of his apartment, a pretty and, as they say, developed girl: she read serious articles in the Science department in magazines. He married her as soon as the period of mourning had passed, and, having left the ministry of estates, where, through patronage, his father wrote him down, he was blissful with his Masha, first at the dacha near the Forestry Institute, then in the city, in a small and pretty apartment, with clean stairs and coldish living room, finally - in the village, where he finally settled and where his son Arkady was soon born. The couple lived very well and quietly: they almost never parted, read together, played four hands on the piano, sang duets; she planted flowers and watched the poultry yard, he occasionally went hunting and did the housekeeping, and Arkady grew and grew - also good and quiet. Ten years passed like a dream. In 1947, Kirsanov's wife died. He barely endured this blow, turned gray in a few weeks; he was about to go abroad, in order to dissipate at least a little ... but then came the 48th year. [3] He reluctantly returned to the village and, after a rather long inactivity, took up economic reforms. In 55, he took his son to the university; lived with him for three winters in Petersburg, almost never leaving and trying to make acquaintances with Arkady's young comrades. He could not come for the last winter, and so we see him in the month of May 1859, already completely gray-haired, plump and a little hunched over: he is waiting for a son, who, as he himself had once received, the title of candidate.","His name was Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov, and he owned ( some fifteen versts from the posting-house) a respectable little property of about two hundred souls (or, as, after that he had apportioned his peasantry allotments, and set up a ""farm ,"" he himself expressed it, a property ""of two thousand desiatini""[2]). His father, one of the generals of 1812, had spent his life exclusively in military service as the commander, first of a brigade, and then of a division; and always he had been quartered in the provinces, where his rank had enabled him to cut a not inconspicuous figure. As for Nikolai Petrovitch himself, he was born in Southern Russia (as also was his elder brother, Paul—of whom presently), and, until his fourteenth year, received his education amid a circle of hard-up governors, free-and-easy aides-de-camp, and sundry staff and regimental officers. His mother came of the family of the Koliazins, and, known in maidenhood as Agathe, and subsequently as Agathoklea Kuzminishna Kirsanov, belonged to the type of ""officer's lady. "" That is to say, she wore pompous mobcaps and rustling silk dresses, was always the first to approach the cross in church, talked volubly and in a loud tone, of set practice admitted her sons to kiss her hand in the morning, and never failed to bless them before retiring to rest at night. In short, she lived the life which suited her. As the son of a general, Nikolai Petrovitch was bound—though he evinced no particular bravery, and might even have seemed a coward—to follow his brother Paul's example by entering the army; but unfortunately, owing to the fact that, on the very day when there arrived the news of his commission, he happened to break his leg, it befell that, after two months in bed, he rose to his feet a permanently lamed man. When his father had finished wringing his hands over the mischance, he sent his son to acquire a civilian education; whence it came about that Nikolai, at eighteen, found himself a student at the University of St. Petersburg. At the same period his brother obtained a commission in one of the regiments of Guards; and, that being so, their father apportioned the two young men a joint establishment, and placed it under the more or less detached supervision of Ilya Koliazin, their maternal uncle and a leading tchinovnik.[3] That done, the father returned to his division and his wife, and only at rare intervals sent his sons sheets of grey foolscap (scrawled and re-scrawled in flamboyant calligraphy) to which there was appended, amid a bower of laborious flourishes, the signature ""Piotr Kirsanov, Major-General."" In the year 1835 Nikolai Petrovitch obtained his university degree; and in the same year General Kirsanov was retired for incompetence at a review, and decided to transfer his quarters to St. Petersburg. Unfortunately, just as he was on the point both of renting a house near the Tavritchesky Gardens and of being enrolled as a member of the English Club, a stroke put an end to his career, and Agathoklea Kuzminishna followed him soon afterwards, since never had she succeeded in taking to the dull life of the capital, but always had hankered after the old provincial existence. Already during his parents' lifetime, and to their no small vexation, Nikolai Petrovitch had contrived to fall in love with the daughter of a certain tchinovnik named Prepolovensky, the landlord of his flat; and since the maiden was not only comely, but one of the type known as ""advanced"" (that is to say, she perused an occasional ""Science"" article in one newspaper or another), he married her out of hand as soon as the term of mourning was ended, and, abandoning the Ministry of Provincial Affairs to which, through his father's influence, he had been posted, embarked upon connubial felicity in a villa adjoining the Institute of Forestry. Thence, after a while, the couple removed to a diminutive, but in every way respectable, flat which could boast of a spotless vestibule and an icy-cold drawing-room; and thence, again, they migrated to the country, where they settled for good, and where, in due time, they had born to them a son Arkady. The existence of husband and wife was one of perfect comfort and tranquillity. Almost never were they parted from one another, they read together, they played the piano together, and they sang duets. Also, she would garden or superintend the poultry-yard, and he would set forth a-hunting, or see to the management of the estate. Meanwhile Arkady led an existence of equal calm and comfort, and grew, and waxed fat; until, in 1847, when ten years had been passed in this idyllic fashion, Kirsanov's wife breathed her last. The blow proved almost more than the husband could bear—so much so that his head turned grey in a few weeks. Yet, though he sought distraction for his thoughts by going abroad, he felt constrained, in the following year, to return home, where, after a prolonged period of inaction, he took up the subject of Industrial Reform. Next, in 1855, he sent his son to the University of St. Petersburg, and, for the same reason, spent the following three winters in the capital, where he seldom went out, but spent the greater part of his time in endeavouring to fraternise with his son's youthful acquaintances. The fourth winter, however, he was prevented by various circumstances from spending in St. Petersburg; and thus in the May of 1859 we see him—grey-headed, dusty, a trifle bent, and wholly middle-aged—awaiting his son's home-coming after the elevation of the latter (in Nikolai's own footsteps) to the dignity of a graduate.","His name was Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov. He had, twelve miles from the posting station, a fine property of two hundred souls, or, as he expressed it—since he had arranged the division of his land with the peasants, and started 'a farm'—of nearly five thousand acres. His father, a general in the army, who served in 1812, a coarse, half-educated, but not ill-natured man, a typical Russian, had been in harness all his life, first in command of a brigade, and then of a division, and lived constantly in the provinces, where, by virtue of his rank, he played a fairly important part. Nikolai Petrovitch was born in the south of Russia like his elder brother, Pavel, of whom more hereafter. He was educated at home till he was fourteen, surrounded by cheap tutors, free-and-easy but toadying adjutants, and all the usual regimental and staff set. His mother, one of the Kolyazin family, as a girl called Agathe, but as a general's wife Agathokleya Kuzminishna Kirsanov, was one of those military ladies who take their full share of the duties and dignities of office. She wore gorgeous caps and rustling silk dresses; in church she was the first to advance to the cross; she talked a great deal in a loud voice, let her children kiss her hand in the morning, and gave them her blessing at night— in fact, she got everything out of life she could. Nikolai Petrovitch, as a general's son—though so far from being distinguished by courage that he even deserved to be called 'a funk'—was intended, like his brother Pavel, to enter the army; but he broke his leg on the very day when the news of his commission came, and, after being two months in bed, retained a slight limp to the end of his days. His father gave him up as a bad job, and let him go into the civil service. He took him to Petersburg directly he was eighteen, and placed him in the university. His brother happened about the same time to be made an officer in the Guards. The young men started living together in one set of rooms, under the remote supervision of a cousin on their mother's side, Ilya Kolyazin, an official of high rank. Their father returned to his division and his wife, and only rarely sent his sons large sheets of grey paper, scrawled over in a bold clerkly hand. At the bottom of these sheets stood in letters, enclosed carefully in scroll-work, the words, 'Piotr Kirsanov, General-Major.' In 1835 Nikolai Petrovitch left the university, a graduate, and in the same year General Kirsanov was put on to the retired list after an unsuccessful review, and came to Petersburg with his wife to live. He was about to take a house in the Tavrichesky Gardens, and had joined the English club, but he died suddenly of an apoplectic fit. Agathokleya Kuzminishna soon followed him; she could not accustom herself to a dull life in the capital; she was consumed by the ennui of existence away from the regiment. Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovitch had already, in his parents' lifetime and to their no slight chagrin, had time to fall in love with the daughter of his landlord, a petty official, Prepolovensky. She was a pretty and, as it is called, 'advanced' girl; she used to read the serious articles in the 'Science' column of the journals. He married her directly the term of mourning was over; and leaving the civil service in which his father had by favour procured him a post, was perfectly blissful with his Masha, first in a country villa near the Lyesny Institute, afterwards in town in a pretty little flat with a clean staircase and a draughty drawing-room, and then in the country, where he settled finally, and where in a short time a son, Arkady, was born to him. The young couple lived very happily and peacefully; they were scarcely ever apart; they read together, sang and played duets together on the piano; she tended her flowers and looked after the poultry-yard; he sometimes went hunting, and busied himself with the estate, while Arkady grew and grew in the same happy and peaceful way. Ten years passed like a dream. In 1847 Kirsanov's wife died. He almost succumbed to this blow; in a few weeks his hair was grey; he was getting ready to go abroad, if possible to distract his mind ... but then came the year 1848. He returned unwillingly to the country, and, after a rather prolonged period of inactivity, began to take an interest in improvements in the management of his land. In 1855 he brought his son to the university; he spent three winters with him in Petersburg, hardly going out anywhere, and trying to make acquaintance with Arkady's young companions. The last winter he had not been able to go, and here we have him in the May of 1859, already quite grey, stoutish, and rather bent, waiting for his son, who had just taken his degree, as once he had taken it himself.","His name is Nikolay Petrovich Kirsanov. Ten miles from that little inn he has a decent property of 200 souls,2 or, as he now puts it since he settled the boundaries with the peasants and started a modern ‘farm’, of 5,000 acres of land. His father, a general and a veteran of the War of 1812,3 a semi-literate Russian type, coarse-grained but decent, had served in the army all his life. He commanded first a brigade, then a division, and had always lived in the provinces, where by virtue of his rank he played a fairly important role. Nikolay Petrovich was born in the south of Russia, like his elder brother Pavel, of whom we shall speak later, and till the age of fourteen he was educated at home, surrounded by ill-paid tutors, easy-going but obsequious adjutants and other regimental and staff personnel. His mother, née Kolyazin, as a girl had been known as Agathe4 but when she became the general’s lady, as Agafokleya Kuzminishna Kirsanova. She could be classed as a ‘barracks matriarch’. She wore splendid caps and rustling silk gowns; in church she was first to go up and kiss the cross; she spoke loudly and a great deal , in the mornings she gave her children her hand to kiss, and at night she blessed them – in short, she did exactly as she pleased. As a general’s son Nikolay Petrovich was destined for the army, like his brother Pavel – although not only was he far from being a hero, he even had the reputation of being ‘a bit of a softy’. But he broke his leg on the very day the news of his commission arrived. He spent two months lying in bed and for the rest of his life he had a ‘bad leg’. His father gave up on him and let him follow a civilian career. He took him to St Petersburg as soon as he was eighteen and enrolled him in the university. At the same time his brother happened to get his commission in a Guards regiment. The young men began sharing an apartment, under the distant supervision of a cousin on their mother’s side, Ilya Kolyazin, a senior civil servant. Their father returned to his army division and his spouse, and only occasionally sent his sons large sheets of grey paper scrawled in his bold clerk’s hand, the last sheet graced by the words ‘Piotr Kirsanov, Major-General’, laboriously surrounded by flourishes. In 1835 Nikolay Petrovich left university with a degree, and in the same year General Kirsanov, who had been forced into retirement after a poor performance by his troops on review, came with his wife to live in St Petersburg. He intended to rent a house near the Tauride Garden and had put his name down for the English Club, but he suddenly died of a stroke. Agafokleya Kuzminishna soon followed him. She could not get used to an obscure life in the capital. The boredom of a pensioned existence consumed her. Meanwhile Nikolay Petrovich, while his parents were still alive and to their considerable chagrin, had managed to fall in love with the daughter of Prepolovensky, a minor civil servant who was his former landlord. She was a pretty young lady, and a ‘cultured’ one too: meaning that she read the serious articles in the ‘Science’ section of the reviews. He married her as soon as the period of mourning for his parents was over. He left the Ministry of Crown Lands – where his father had got him a position through connections – and led a life of bliss with his Masha, first in a dacha5 near the Forestry Institute, then in the city, in a small and attractive apartment with clean stairs and a chilly drawing room, and eventually in the country, where he finally settled, and where after a short time he had a son, Arkady. The couple lived very happily and quietly: they were almost never parted, they read together, sang and played duets on the piano. She planted flowers and looked after the poultry yard, he occasionally went shooting and looked after the estate, and Arkady grew and grew – also happily and quietly. Ten years passed like a dream. In 1847 Kirsanov’s wife died. He was hardly able to bear that blow, and his hair went grey in a few weeks. He was planning to go abroad for a little distraction… but then came 1848.6 He had no choice but to go back to the country and after a rather long period of doing nothing he occupied himself with introducing changes on his estate. In 1855 he took his son to university and spent three winters with him in St Petersburg, hardly ever going out and trying to get to know Arkady’s young classmates. The final winter he couldn’t go to Petersburg – and so we see him now in May 1859, completely grey-haired , a little plump and slightly bent: he is waiting for his son, who has just got his master’s degree as he had once done himself."

"– А! вот вы куда забрались! – раздался в это мгновение голос Василия Ивановича, и старый штаб-лекарь предстал перед молодыми людьми, облеченный в домоделанный полотняный пиджак и с соломенною, тоже домоделанною, шляпой на голове. – Я вас искал, искал… Но вы отличное выбрали место и прекрасному предаетесь занятию.

Do you know - there is some special meaning in this!","""This, then, is where you have got to!"" cried Vasili Ivanitch from behind them as, vested in a home-made cotton pea-jacket and a home-made straw hat, the old military doctor suddenly confronted the pair. ""I have been searching for you everywhere, and certainly you have chosen a capital spot, and are engaged also in a capital occupation—in the occupation of lying on the earth and gazing at the heavens. For my part, I believe that such an occupation can have its uses.""","'Ah! so this is where you have got to!' the voice of Vassily Ivanovitch was heard saying at that instant, and the old army-doctor appeared before the young men, garbed in a home-made linen pea-jacket, with a straw hat, also home-made, on his head.

"Он встречался с ней большею частью по утрам рано, в саду или на дворе; в комнату к ней он не захаживал, и она всего раз подошла к его двери, чтобы спросить его – купать ли ей Митю или нет? Она не только доверялась ему, не только его не боялась, она при нем держалась вольнее и развязнее, чем при самом Николае Петровиче. Трудно сказать, отчего это происходило; может быть, оттого, что она бессознательно чувствовала в Базарове отсутствие всего дворянского, всего того высшего, что и привлекает и пугает. В ее глазах он и доктор был отличный, и человек простой. Не стесняясь его присутствием, она возилась с своим ребенком и однажды, когда у ней вдруг закружилась и заболела голова, из его рук приняла ложку лекарства. При Николае Петровиче она как будто чуждалась Базарова: она это делала не из хитрости, а из какого-то чувства приличия. Павла Петровича она боялась больше, чем когда-либо; он с некоторых пор стал наблюдать за нею и неожиданно появлялся, словно из земли вырастал за ее спиною в своем сьюте, с неподвижным зорким лицом и руками в карманах. «Так тебя холодом и обдаст», – жаловалась Фенечка Дуняше, а та в ответ ей вздыхала и думала о другом «бесчувственном» человеке. Базаров, сам того не подозревая, сделался жестоким тираном ее души.","He met her for the most part in the early mornings, in the garden or in the yard; he did not come to her room, and she only once went to his door to ask him - should she bathe Mitya or not? She not only trusted him, not only was not afraid of him, she behaved more freely and cheekily with him than under Nikolai Petrovich himself. It is difficult to say why this happened; perhaps because she unconsciously felt in Bazarov the absence of everything that was noble, of all that higher that both attracts and frightens. In her eyes, he was both an excellent doctor and a simple man. Not embarrassed by his presence, she fiddled with her child and once, when she suddenly felt dizzy and had a headache, she took a spoonful of medicine from his hands. Under Nikolai Petrovich, she seemed to shy away from Bazarov: she did this not out of cunning, but out of some sense of decency. She feared Pavel Petrovich more than ever; for some time now he began to observe her and suddenly appeared, as if he were sprouting out of the earth behind her in his suite, with a motionless watchful face and hands in his pockets. “So it’ll give you cold,” Fenechka complained to Dunyasha, who sighed in response and thought of another “insensitive” person. Bazarov, without knowing it, became a cruel tyrant of her soul.","Mostly he encountered her in the early mornings, when she was walking in the garden or the courtyard; but never did he enter her room, nor did she ever come to his door, save once, for the purpose of asking him to help her with Mitia's bath. And she not only trusted Bazarov; she also held him in no awe, and allowed herself more freedom in his presence than she did in that of Nikolai Petrovitch himself. The reason is difficult to determine. Perhaps it was the fact that unconsciously she detected in Bazarov none of the dvorianin element, none of that superiority which at once attracts and repels; the young Nihilist, to her, was just a clever doctor, and no more. At all events, she was so free from shyness in his presence that she would dandle her child unabashed, and, on one occasion, when seized with a headache, went so far as to accept at his hands a spoonful of medicine. True, in Nikolai Petrovitch's presence she seemed to shun Bazarov; but this was done more out of a sense of decorum than through subtlety. As for Paul Petrovitch, she feared him as much as ever, for he had taken to watching her with a keen, steady eye, and to making his appearance behind her as though his figure, clad in its inevitable English suit, and posed in its usual attitude of hands in trousers pockets, had suddenly sprung from the floor. ""Whenever I see him I feel cold all over,"" once she complained to Duniasha; whereupon that maiden's thoughts reverted longingly to another ""unfeeling"" individual who had, all unwittingly, come to be ""the cruel tyrant"" of her heart.","He used to meet her for the most part early in the morning, in the garden, or the farmyard; he never used to go to her room to see her, and she had only once been to his door to inquire—ought she to let Mitya have his bath or not? It was not only that she confided in him, that she was not afraid of him —she was positively freer and more at her ease in her behaviour with him than with Nikolai Petrovitch himself. It is hard to say how it came about; perhaps it was because she unconsciously felt the absence in Bazarov of all gentility, of all that superiority which at once attracts and overawes. In her eyes he was both an excellent doctor and a simple man. She looked after her baby without constraint in his presence; and once when she was suddenly attacked with giddiness and headache—she took a spoonful of medicine from his hand. Before Nikolai Petrovitch she kept, as it were, at a distance from Bazarov; she acted in this way not from hypocrisy, but from a kind of feeling of propriety. Pavel Petrovitch she was more afraid of than ever; for some time he had begun to watch her, and would suddenly make his appearance, as though he sprang out of the earth behind her back, in his English suit, with his immovable vigilant face, and his hands in his pockets. ' It's like a bucket of cold water on one,' Fenitchka complained to Dunyasha, and the latter sighed in response, and thought of another 'heartless' man. Bazarov, without the least suspicion of the fact, had become the cruel tyrant of her heart.","They usually met in the mornings, early, in the garden or the farmyard. He didn’t go into her room, and she only once went to his door to ask him whether she should bath Mitya or not. Not only did she trust him, not only did she have no fear of him , she behaved with him more freely and more easily than with Nikolay Petrovich himself. It’s difficult to say why this happened. Maybe because she unconsciously sensed in Bazarov the absence of anything aristocratic or superior, which can be both attractive and alarming. He was in her eyes both an excellent doctor and a straightforward man. His presence while she looked after her baby didn’t make her nervous and once, when she suddenly felt giddy and a headache coming on, she accepted a spoonful of medicine from him. In front of Nikolay Petrovich she seemed to avoid Bazarov: she did this not out of guile but from some kind of feeling of propriety. She was more frightened of Pavel Petrovich than ever. For some time he had started to watch her, and he used to turn up unexpectedly as if he had sprung out of the ground behind her back in his ‘suit’, with his sharp-eyed, immobile features and his hands in his pockets. ‘It makes a shiver go down your spine,’ Fenechka complained to Dunyasha, who in response sighed and thought of another ‘unfeeling’ man. Bazarov, without suspecting it, had become the cruel tyrant of her soul."
"– Нет, седьмой; как можно! – Ребенок опять засмеялся, уставился на сундук и вдруг схватил свою мать всею пятерней за нос и за губы. – Баловник, – проговорила Фенечка, не отодвигая лица от его пальцев.","- No, seventh; as you can! The child laughed again, stared at the chest and suddenly grabbed his mother with all his hands by the nose and lips. ""A balovnik,"" said Fenechka, without moving her face from his fingers.","""No, seven."" Here the infant crowed, fixed his eyes upon the chest in the corner, and suddenly closed his five tiny fingers upon his mother's mouth and nose. ""The little rascal!"" she said, without, however, freeing her features from his grasp.","'No, seven; what an idea!' The baby chuckled again, stared at the chest, and suddenly caught hold of his mother's nose and mouth with all his five little fingers. ' Saucy mite,' said Fenitchka, not drawing her face away.","‘No, of course it’s seven!’ The baby laughed again, stared at the trunk and suddenly grabbed at his mother’s nose and lips with his whole hand. ‘ Naughty boy,’ said Fenechka, without moving her face away from his grasp."

You don't even know how to talk to him.","With a sort of indolent hauteur Bazarov replied: ""With his own hand did my grandfather guide the plough. Ask, therefore, of your favourite peasant which of us two—you or myself—he rates most truly as his countryman. Why, you do not know even how to speak to him!""","'My grandfather ploughed the land,' answered Bazarov with haughty pride.

"– Да кто его презирает? – возразил Базаров. – А я все-таки скажу, что человек, который всю свою жизнь поставил на карту женской любви и, когда ему эту карту убили, раскис и опустился до того, что ни на что не стал способен, этакой человек – не мужчина, не самец. Ты говоришь, что он несчастлив: тебе лучше знать; но дурь из него не вся вышла. Я уверен, что он не шутя воображает себя дельным человеком, потому что читает Галиньяшку и раз в месяц избавит мужика от экзекуции.","- Who despises him? Objected Bazarov. - But I still say that a man who all his life has put on the card of female love and, when this card was killed to him, became limp and sank to the point that he was not capable of anything, such a person is not a man, not a male ... You say that he is unhappy: you know better; but not all the nonsense came out of him. I am sure that he does not jokingly imagine himself to be a sensible person, because he reads Galinyashka and once a month will save the peasant from execution.","""Who is despising him?"" exclaimed Bazarov. "" All that I say is that a man who has staked his whole upon a woman's love, and, on losing the throw, has turned crusty, and let himself drift to such an extent as to become good for nothing—I say that such a man is not a man, a male creature at all. He is unhappy, you say; and certainly you know him better than I do; but it is clear also that he has not yet cleansed himself of the fool. In other words, certain am I that, just because he occasionally reads Galignani, and because, once a month, he saves a peasant from distress for debt, he believes himself really to be a man of action.""","'And who does despise him?' retorted Bazarov. ' Still, I must say that a fellow who stakes his whole life on one card—a woman's love—and when that card fails, turns sour, and lets himself go till he's fit for nothing, is not a man, but a male. You say he's unhappy; you ought to know best; to be sure, he's not got rid of all his fads. I'm convinced that he solemnly imagines himself a superior creature because he reads that wretched Galignani, and once a month saves a peasant from a flogging.'","‘Who is despising him?’ Bazarov countered. ‘But I’ll still say that an individual who has staked his whole life on the card of a woman’s love, who, when he’s lost that card, collapses and lets himself go so he’s no good for anything, isn’t a man, isn’t a male. You say he’s unhappy: you know best; but all the nonsense hasn’t been knocked out of him. I am certain he seriously imagines himself to be an intelligent man because he reads old Galignani6 and once a month gets a peasant off a flogging.’"

Only my father was certainly not expecting me to be “apprised” of this, as they say. He was very embarrassed, and now on top of that I’m going to hurt him… It doesn’t matter! He’ll get over it.’"
