"Я, разумеется, все рассказал ему, все с самого начала, и рассказывал, может быть, около часу. Да и как могло быть иначе; я жаждал говорить еще давеча. Я начал с самой первой нашей встречи, тогда у князя, по ее приезде из Москвы; потом рассказал, как все это шло постепенно. Я не пропустил ничего, да и не мог пропустить: он сам наводил, он угадывал, он подсказывал. Мгновениями мне казалось, что происходит что-то фантастическое, что он где-нибудь там сидел или стоял за дверьми, каждый раз, во все эти два месяца: он знал вперед каждый мой жест, каждое мое чувство. Я ощущал необъятное наслаждение в этой исповеди ему, потому что видел в нем такую задушевную мягкость, такую глубокую психологическую тонкость, такую удивительную способность угадывать с четверть слова. Он выслушивал нежно, как женщина. Главное, он сумел сделать так, что я ничего не стыдился; иногда он вдруг останавливал меня на какой-нибудь подробности; часто останавливал и нервно повторял: «Не забывай мелочей, главное – не забывай мелочей, чем мельче черта, тем иногда она важнее». И в этом роде он несколько раз перебивал меня. О, разумеется, я начал сначала свысока, к ней свысока, но быстро свел на истину. Я искренно рассказал ему, что готов был бросаться целовать то место на полу, где стояла ее нога. Всего краше, всего светлее было то, что он в высшей степени понял, что «можно страдать страхом по документу» и в то же время оставаться чистым и безупречным существом, каким она сегодня передо мной открылась. Он в высшей степени понял слово «студент». Но когда я уже оканчивал, то заметил, что сквозь добрую улыбку его начало по временам проскакивать что-то уж слишком нетерпеливое в его взгляде, что-то как бы рассеянное и резкое. Когда я дошел до «документа», то подумал про себя: «Сказать ему настоящую правду или не сказать?» – и не сказал, несмотря на весь мой восторг. Это я отмечаю здесь для памяти на всю мою жизнь. Я ему объяснил дело так же, как и ей, то есть Крафтом. Глаза его загорелись. Странная складка мелькнула на лбу, очень мрачная складка.","Of course, I told him everything, everything from the very beginning, and told him maybe about an hour. And how could it be otherwise; I longed to speak even earlier. I began with our very first meeting, then at the prince's, upon her arrival from Moscow; then he told how it all went gradually. I didn’t miss anything, and I couldn’t miss it: he pointed, he guessed, he prompted. For a moment it seemed to me that something fantastic was happening, that he was sitting somewhere or standing outside the door, every time, during all these two months: he knew in advance my every gesture, my every feeling. I felt an immense pleasure in this confession to him, because I saw in him such sincere gentleness, such deep psychological subtlety, such an amazing ability to guess a quarter of a word. He listened tenderly like a woman. Most importantly, he managed to make sure that I was not ashamed of anything; sometimes he suddenly stopped me at some detail; often stopped and nervously repeated: ""Do not forget the little things, the main thing is not to forget the little things, the smaller the trait, the sometimes it is more important."" And in this way he interrupted me several times. Oh, of course, I started at first condescendingly, condescendingly towards her, but quickly reduced to the truth. I sincerely told him that I was ready to rush to kiss the place on the floor where her foot stood. The most beautiful, brightest of all was that he understood to the highest degree that “it is possible to suffer from fear according to the document” and at the same time remain a pure and flawless being, as she revealed to me today. He understood the word ""student"" to the highest degree. But when I was already finishing, I noticed that through his kind smile, something began to slip from time to time something too impatient in his look, something as if absent-minded and sharp. When I got to the “document,” I thought to myself, “Should I tell him the real truth or not?” - and did not say, despite all my delight. This I mark here for the memory of my whole life. I explained the matter to him in the same way as to her, that is, by Kraft. His eyes lit up. A strange wrinkle flickered across his forehead, a very gloomy wrinkle.","Of course I told him everything from beginning to end. I talked nonstop for a whole hour, and no wonder since I'd been longing to talk about it all day. I started from the first time I'd met her at her father's, the old Prince Sokolsky, when she'd just arrived in Moscow. Then I told him how gradually things had developed. I didn't leave out anything; I couldn't have, for he himself led me on by his questions to tell him everything; he even guessed much and at times actually prompted me. Now and then I had a strange feeling that there was something uncanny about him: it was as though he'd been eavesdropping behind the door wherever I'd been during the past two months: he knew instinctively everything I felt and thought. I derived boundless delight from confessing to him because I found in him such intimate gentleness combined with a profound psychological understanding and a mysterious gift for knowing what I was going to say before I uttered the first word. He could listen with the tender attention of a woman. Above all, he succeeded in putting me so much at ease that nothing embarrassed me any more. Now and then he stopped me to make me repeat some detail, saying: 'Leave nothing out, I want every tiniest detail; the tinier it is, the more important it may turn out to be."" He interrupted me several times to tell me words to that effect. Oh, of course, at first I began speaking of her in a casual tone, but soon enough I dropped the pose. I reached the point where I told him in all candor that I had impulses to throw myself on the ground and kiss the spot where her foot had rested. The greatest and most glorious thing was his absolute understanding of her being so frightfully worried about the document without that preventing her from being the pure and irreproachable woman she had revealed herself to be earlier that day. He understood very well what she meant by saying that we talked to each other like ""fellow students."" As my story was drawing to an end, however, I noticed that under his kindly smile was now an impatient twitch and a vague air of absent-mindedness and impatience. When I came to the actual whereabouts of the ""document,"" I hesitated whether to tell him the whole truth or not, and finally, despite my state of exaltation, I didn't tell him. I'm recording this fact here so that I may remember it as long as I live. I gave him the same version I'd given her— I mean about Kraft destroying the letter. His eyes glowed then. A strange frown appeared on his brow, a very grim and ominous frown.","I told him all there was to tell, of course, everything from the very beginning, and it took me perhaps an hour telling it. And indeed how could I have helped telling him? I had been dying to talk of it that afternoon. I began with our very first meeting at the old prince's on the day she arrived from Moscow; then I described how it had all come about by degrees. I left nothing out, and indeed I could not have left anything out; he led me on, he guessed what was coming and prompted me. At moments it seemed to me that something fantastic was happening, that he must have been sitting or standing behind the door, for those two months; he knew beforehand every gesture I made, every feeling I had felt. I derived infinite enjoyment from this confession to him, for I found in him such intimate softness, such deep psychological subtlety, such a marvellous faculty for guessing what I meant from half a word. He listened as tenderly as a woman. And above all he knew how to save me from feeling ashamed; at times he stopped me at some detail; often when he stopped me he repeated nervously: "" Don't forget details; the great thing is, not to forget any details; the more minute a point is, the more important it may sometimes be."" And he interrupted me several times with words to that effect. Oh, of course I began at first in a tone of superiority, superiority to her, but I quickly dropped into sincerity. I told him honestly that I was ready to kiss the spot on the floor where her foot had rested. The most beautiful and glorious thing was that he absolutely understood that she might ""be suffering from terror over the letter"" and yet remain the pure and irreproachable being she had revealed herself to be. He absolutely realized what was meant by the word ""student."" But when I was near the end of my story I noticed that behind his good-natured smile there were signs in his face from time to time of some impatience, some abruptness and preoccupation; when I came to the letter, I thought to myself: ""Shall I tell him the exact truth or not?"" and I did not tell it, in spite of my enthusiasm. I note this here that I may remember it all my life. I explained to him, as I had done to her, that it had been destroyed by Kraft. His eyes began to glow; a strange line, a line of deep gloom was visible on his forehead."

"Я действительно был в некотором беспокойстве. Конечно, я не привык к обществу, даже к какому бы ни было. В гимназии я с товарищами был на ты, но ни с кем почти не был товарищем, я сделал себе угол и жил в углу. Но не это смущало меня. На всякий случай я дал себе слово не входить в споры и говорить только самое необходимое, так чтоб никто не мог обо мне ничего заключить; главное – не спорить.","I really was in some anxiety. Of course, I'm not used to society, even to any kind. In the gymnasium, I was on friendly terms with my comrades, but I was hardly a comrade with anyone, I made myself a corner and lived in a corner. But that wasn't what bothered me. Just in case, I made a promise to myself not to enter into disputes and to say only the most necessary, so that no one could conclude anything about me; the main thing is not to argue.","It's true that I did feel rather uneasy. Of course, I was in general unaccustomed to the company of people, whoever they were. Even at school, I had to overcome disgust and force myself to chat familiarly with my classmates and I certainly never became really close with any of them. I built myself a shell and stayed inside it. But that was not what was bothering me right now. To be on the safe side, I decided to stay out of arguments, to say as little as possible, so that no one could say anything about me, but, above all, not to get involved in the discussion.","I certainly was in some uneasiness. I was, of course, not accustomed to society of any kind. At school I had been on familiar terms with my schoolfellows, but I was scarcely friends with anyone; I made a little corner for myself and lived in it. But this was not what disturbed me. In any case I vowed not to let myself be drawn into argument and to say nothing beyond what was necessary, so that no one could draw any conclusions about me; above all—to avoid argument."
"Было, я думаю, около половины одиннадцатого, когда я, возбужденный и, сколько помню, как-то странно рассеянный, но с окончательным решением в сердце, добрел до своей квартиры. Я не торопился, я знал уже, как поступлю. И вдруг, едва только я вступил в наш коридор, как точас же понял, что стряслась новая беда и произошло необыкновенное усложнение дела: старый князь, только что привезенный из Царского Села, находился в нашей квартире, а при нем была Анна Андреевна!","It was, I think, about half-past ten when I, excited and, as far as I remember, somehow strangely absent-minded, but with a final decision in my heart, made my way to my apartment.

"Но ведь оказывается, что этот человек – лишь мечта моя, мечта с детских лет. Это я сам его таким выдумал, а на деле оказался другой, упавший столь ниже моей фантазии. Я приехал к человеку чистому, а не к этому. И к чему я влюбился в него, раз навсегда, в ту маленькую минутку, как увидел его когда-то, бывши ребенком? Это «навсегда» должно исчезнуть. Я когда-нибудь, если место найдется, опишу эту первую встречу нашу: это пустейший анекдот, из которого ровно ничего не выходит. Но у меня вышла целая пирамида. Я начал эту пирамиду еще под детским одеялом, когда, засыпая, мог плакать и мечтать – о чем? – сам не знаю. О том, что меня оставили? О том, что меня мучат? Но мучили меня лишь немножко, всего только два года, в пансионе Тушара, в который он меня тогда сунул и уехал навсегда. Потом меня никто не мучил; даже напротив, я сам гордо смотрел на товарищей. Да и терпеть я не могу этого ноющего по себе сиротства! Ничего нет омерзительнее роли, когда сироты, незаконнорожденные, все эти выброшенные и вообще вся эта дрянь, к которым я нисколько вот-таки не имею жалости, вдруг торжественно воздвигаются перед публикой и начинают жалобно, но наставительно завывать: «Вот, дескать, как поступили с нами!» Я бы сек этих сирот. Никто-то не поймет из этой гнусной казенщины, что в десять раз ему благороднее смолчать, а не выть и не удостоивать жаловаться. А коли начал удостоивать, то так тебе, сыну любви, и надо. Вот моя мысль!","But it turns out that this person is just my dream, a dream from my childhood. It was I who invented him like that, but in fact it turned out to be another one, which fell so far below my imagination. I came to a pure man, not to this one. And why did I fall in love with him, once for all, in that little moment when I saw him once, when I was a child? This ""forever"" should disappear. Someday, if there is a place, I will describe this first meeting of ours: this is the most empty anecdote, from which absolutely nothing comes out. But I got a whole pyramid. I started this pyramid under the baby blanket, when, falling asleep, I could cry and dream - about what? - I don't know myself. About leaving me? About what hurts me? But they tormented me only a little, only two years, in the boarding school Touchara, into which he then put me and left forever. Then no one tormented me; on the contrary, I myself proudly looked at my comrades. Yes, and I can’t stand this aching orphanhood! There is nothing more disgusting than a role, when orphans, illegitimate, all those thrown out and in general all this rubbish, for which I have no pity at all, suddenly solemnly rise up in front of the public and begin to plaintively, but didactically howl: “Here, they say, how they did with us!"" I would sec these orphans. No one will understand from this vile bureaucracy that it is ten times nobler for him to remain silent, and not to howl and not deign to complain. And if he began to honor, then so be it to you, the son of love. Here is my thought!","But now it looked as if this man were nothing but a figment of my imagination that had been in me since childhood. I had invented him myself and now the real man could not possibly match that imaginary being. I'd come here to find a man with a noble soul, not what I'd found. And why did I have to fall in love with him so irrevocably during that brief moment I'd seen him as a child? No, it mustn't be ""irrevocably""! Sometime, if I have an opportunity, I'll describe that first meeting, which was really nothing much and from which it is difficult to make out anything. But in my imagination it grew into a whole pyramid. I started building that pyramid under the blanket of my little boy's bed before I fell asleep at night, during the moments when I was free to dream up things and cry. Why cry? I don't know myself. Perhaps because they had got rid of me? Because I was being oppressed? But I felt oppressed only for two years while I was at Touchard's school, and even then only slightly oppressed. Later, there was no one to oppress me and, if anything, it was I who treated other boys with contempt. Besides, I loathe that poor-dear-little-abandoned-orphan stuff. There's nothing more nauseating than orphans, illegitimate children, foundlings, and all that human jetsam in general, for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever, being solemnly held up to the public eye and simpering plaintively, albeit persistently, ""Look what was done to us! "" I'd like to whip those orphans! None of that sickening lot will ever understand that it would be ten times more dignified for them to keep their traps shut and not pay society the high tribute of asking for its sympathy. But once they've paid this tribute, I say to them: ""You've asked for it, you bastards, so it serves you right. "" That's what I think about it.","But it turned out that this man was only a dream, the dream of my childhood. I had invented him myself, and in reality he was a different man who fell far below my imagination. I had come to find a genuine man, not a man like this. And why had I fallen in love with him once and for ever in that brief moment when I saw him as a child? That ""for ever"" must vanish. Some time, if I have space for it, I will describe that meeting, the most futile incident leading up to nothing. But I had built it up into a pyramid. I had begun building that pyramid as I lay in my little bed, when, falling asleep, I could dream and weep—what for I cannot tell. Because I had been abandoned? Because I was tormented? But I was only tormented a little, and only for two years at Touchard's, the school into which he thrust me before leaving me for ever. Afterwards no one tormented me; quite the contrary; I looked scornfully at my schoolfellows. And I can't endure the self-pity of the forlorn. There is no rôle more revolting than that of the orphan, the illegitimate, the outcast and all such wretched creatures, for whom I never feel any pity when they solemnly parade before the public and begin piteously but insistently whining of how they have been treated. I could beat them all! Will none of the filthy, conventional herd understand that it would be ten times as creditable to hold their tongues, not to whine and not to DEIGN to complain! And if he does deign he deserves his fate, the bastard. That's my view!"

"А пока я жил с ними на одной квартире, работал и едва удерживался от грубостей. Даже и не удерживался. Прожив уже месяц, я с каждым днем убеждался, что за окончательными разъяснениями ни за что не мог обратиться к нему. Гордый человек прямо стал передо мной загадкой, оскорбившей меня до глубины. Он был со мною даже мил и шутил, но я скорее хотел ссоры, чем таких шуток. Все разговоры мои с ним носили всегда какую-то в себе двусмысленность, то есть попросту какую-то странную насмешку с его стороны. Он с самого начала встретил меня из Москвы несерьезно. Я никак не мог понять, для чего он это сделал. Правда, он достиг того, что остался передо мною непроницаем; но сам я не унизился бы до просьб о серьезности со мной с его стороны. К тому же у него были какие-то удивительные и неотразимые приемы, с которыми я не знал что делать. Короче, со мной он обращался как с самым зеленым подростком, чего я почти не мог перенести, хотя и знал, что так будет. Вследствие того я сам перестал говорить серьезно и ждал; даже почти совсем перестал говорить. Ждал я одного лица, с приездом которого в Петербург мог окончательно узнать истину; в этом была моя последняя надежда. Во всяком случае приготовился порвать окончательно и уже принял все меры. Мать мне жаль было, но… «или он, или я» – вот что я хотел предложить ей и сестре моей. Даже день у меня был назначен; а пока я ходил на службу.","In the meantime, I lived with them in the same apartment, worked and could hardly resist being rude. Didn't even hold back. Having lived for a month now, I became convinced every day that I could never turn to him for final explanations. The proud man directly became a riddle before me, insulting me to the depths. He was even nice to me and joked, but I rather wanted a quarrel than such jokes. All my conversations with him always carried some kind of ambiguity in themselves, that is, simply some kind of strange mockery on his part. From the very beginning he met me from Moscow frivolously. I couldn't understand why he did it. True, he achieved the fact that he remained impenetrable before me; but I myself would not stoop to asking him to be serious with me. In addition, he had some amazing and irresistible tricks with which I did not know what to do. In short, he treated me like the greenest teenager, which I almost could not bear, although I knew that it would be so. As a result, I myself stopped talking seriously and waited; even stopped speaking altogether. I was waiting for one person, with whose arrival in Petersburg I could finally learn the truth; this was my last hope. In any case, he prepared to break completely and had already taken all measures. I felt sorry for my mother, but ... ""either he or I"" - that's what I wanted to offer her and my sister. I even had a day appointed; while I went to work.","In the meantime, I lived in their house, worked, and tried not to be too rude to them, although I certainly didn't try too hard. Nevertheless, after having lived there for a month, I felt less than ever prepared to demand a full explanation of him. That proud man remained a complete enigma to me, and that offended me no end. Actually, if anything, he was rather friendly with me and often said amusing and witty things, while I'd have preferred to his pleasant banter some nasty remark that would have brought about a confrontation. There was an ambiguous overtone to all our conversations, or perhaps I should simply say that in a peculiar way he was making fun of me. From the day I arrived from Moscow, he never took me seriously. I could never understand why. True, thanks to that attitude, he remained inscrutable to me since I couldn't possibly humiliate myself by begging him to take me seriously. On top of that, he could say and do things so unexpected and disarming that they left me quite at a loss. To make a long story short, he treated me as if I were a completely immature adolescent, something I could hardly bear, although I'd anticipated that that was how he'd treat me. As a result, I stopped talking to him seriously myself, and soon I almost stopped talking to him altogether. I waited. What I was waiting for was a person whose arrival in Petersburg might finally enable me to learn the whole truth. That was my last hope. In any case, I was ready to break off with them at any moment and had prepared everything for that eventuality. I was sorry to leave Mother, but it was ""either him or me,"" as I planned to put it to her and to my sister. I'd even fixed the day when I'd leave. In the meantime I went to work every morning.","And meanwhile I was living in the same flat with him, working, and scarcely refraining from being rude. In fact I did not refrain. After spending a month with him I became more convinced every day that I could not possibly appeal to him for a full explanation. This man in his pride remained an enigma to me, while he wounded me deeply. He was positively charming to me, and jested with me, but I should have liked quarrels better than such jests. There was a certain note of ambiguity about all my conversations with him, or more simply, a strange irony on his part. From our first meeting, on my arrival from Moscow, he did not treat me seriously. I never could make out why he took up this line. It is true that by this means he succeeded in remaining impenetrable, but I would not have humbled myself so far as to ask him to treat me seriously. Besides, he had certain wonderful and irresistible ways which I did not know how to deal with. In short he behaved to me as though I were the greenest of raw youths, which I was hardly able to endure, though I knew it would be so. I, too, gave up talking seriously in consequence, and waited; in fact, I almost gave up talking altogether. I waited for a person on whose arrival in Petersburg I might finally learn the truth; that was my last hope. In any case I prepared myself for a final rupture, and had already taken all necessary measures. I was sorry for my mother but—""either him or me ,"" that was the choice I meant to offer her and my sister. I had even fixed on the day; and meanwhile I went to my work."

"Мне мелькнуло вдруг тогда словцо Татьяны Павловны о Версилове: «Пошел бы на Николаевскую дорогу и положил бы голову на рельсы: там бы ему ее и оттяпали». Эта мысль на мгновение овладела всеми моими чувствами, но я мигом и с болью прогнал ее: «Положить голову на рельсы и умереть, а завтра скажут: это оттого он сделал, что украл, сделал от стыда, – нет, ни за что!» И вот в это мгновение, помню, я ощутил вдруг один миг страшной злобы. «Что ж? – пронеслось в уме моем, – оправдаться уж никак нельзя, начать новую жизнь тоже невозможно, а потому – покориться, стать лакеем, собакой, козявкой, доносчиком, настоящим уже доносчиком, а самому потихоньку приготовляться и когда-нибудь – все вдруг взорвать на воздух, все уничтожить, всех, и виноватых и невиноватых, и тут вдруг все узнают, что это – тот самый, которого назвали вором… а там уж и убить себя».","Suddenly Tatyana Pavlovna's saying about Versilov flashed through my mind: ""I would go to the Nikolayevsky road and put my head on the rails: there they would chop it off for him."" This thought for a moment took possession of all my feelings, but I instantly and with pain drove it away: ""Put your head on the rails and die, and tomorrow they will say: it was because he stole, did it out of shame - no, not for anything!"" And at that moment, I remember, I suddenly felt one moment of terrible anger. ""Well? - it flashed through my mind - it’s impossible to justify yourself, it’s also impossible to start a new life, and therefore - to submit, to become a lackey, a dog, a goat, an informer, a real informer, and slowly prepare yourself and someday - all of a sudden blow everything up into the air , to destroy everything, everyone, both the guilty and the innocent, and then suddenly everyone will find out that this is the same one who was called a thief ... and then kill yourself.","I had suddenly recalled Tatyana Prutkov's words when she'd said that Versilov might just as well go to the Nikolaevsky Railroad, lay his head on the tracks, and let the wheels of a train cut it off for him. For a moment that idea took complete possession of my thoughts and feelings, but very quickly I chased it away: ""If I lay my head on the railroad track, tomorrow they'd say I did it because I'd stolen and was ashamed of it. No, no, nothing will force me to do that!"" And it was precisely during that moment that I felt a sudden flash of immense bitterness. "" Well,"" the idea flitted through my mind, "" since I can no longer prove my innocence and since I cannot just turn a page and start a new life, the right course for me is to resign myself and become a lackey, a dog, a bug, a stool pigeon, a real informer, that is, while at the same time I'll get ready secretly. . . . And when the time comes suddenly to blow up everything, wipe out both the guilty and the innocent, then they'll suddenly learn that it was done by the man who had been branded a thief. . . . Well, and then I could kill myself.""","I suddenly recalled Tatyana Pavlovna's saying about Versilov: ""He'd better have gone at night to the Nikolaevsky Railway and have laid his head on the rails—they'd have cut it off for him."" For a moment that idea took possession of all my feelings, but I instantly drove it away with a pang at my heart: "" If I lay my head on the rails and die, they'll say to-morrow he did it because he stole the money, he did it from shame—no, for nothing in the world!"" And at that instant I remember I experienced a sudden flash of fearful anger. ""To clear my character is impossible,"" floated through my mind, ""to begin a new life is impossible too, and so I must submit, become a lackey, a dog, an insect, an informer, a real informer, while I secretly prepare myself, and one day suddenly blow it all up into the air, annihilate everything and every one, guilty and innocent alike, so that they will all know that this was the man they had all called a thief … and then kill myself."""

"– Ни с места! – завопил он, рассвирепев от плевка, схватив ее за плечо и показывая револьвер, – разумеется для одной лишь острастки. – Она вскрикнула и опустилась на диван. Я ринулся в комнату; но в ту же минуту из двери в коридор выбежал и Версилов. (Он там стоял и выжидал.) Не успел я мигнуть, как он выхватил револьвер у Ламберта и из всей силы ударил его револьвером по голове. Ламберт зашатался и упал без чувств; кровь хлынула из его головы на ковер.","- Don `t move! he yelled, furious with spitting, grabbing her by the shoulder and showing her a revolver - of course, for one reason only. She screamed and sank onto the couch. I rushed into the room; but at the same moment Versilov also ran out of the door into the corridor. (He stood there and waited.) Before I could blink, he snatched the revolver from Lambert and hit him on the head with all his might. Lambert staggered and fell unconscious; blood gushed from his head onto the carpet.","""Don't move! Stay right where you are!"" he roared. Her spitting in his face had made him mad with rage. He seized her by the shoulder, pointing the gun at her (obviously just for the effect). She let out a cry and sank back onto the sofa. I leaped out of my hiding place. . . . But that very same second I saw Versilov burst out from behind the door leading into the passage. Before I could blink an eye, the gun was in his hand and Lambert was swaying and falling unconscious as Versilov struck him on the head with it. Blood gushed from Lambert's head onto the rug.","""Don't stir!"" he yelled, furious at her spitting at him, clutching her by the shoulder, and showing her the revolver—simply, of course, to frighten her. She uttered a shriek and sank on the sofa. I burst into the room; but, at the same instant, Versilov ran in at the other door. (He had been standing outside the door waiting.) In a flash he had snatched the revolver from Lambert, and with all his might hit him on the head with it. Lambert staggered and fell senseless; the blood streamed from his head upon the carpet."

"Вскочив в спальню и наткнувшись на кровать, я тотчас заметил, что есть дверь из спальни в кухню, стало быть был исход из беды и можно было убежать совсем, но – о ужас! – дверь была заперта на замок, а в щелке ключа не было. В отчаянии я опустился на кровать; мне ясно представилось, что, стало быть, я теперь буду подслушивать, а уже по первым фразам, по первым звукам разговора я догадался, что разговор их секретный и щекотливый. О, конечно, честный и благородный человек должен был встать, даже и теперь, выйти и громко сказать: «Я здесь, подождите!» – и, несмотря на смешное положение свое, пройти мимо; но я не встал и не вышел; не посмел, подлейшим образом струсил.","Jumping into the bedroom and bumping into the bed, I immediately noticed that there was a door from the bedroom to the kitchen, so there was a way out of trouble and it was possible to run away completely, but - oh horror! The door was locked, and there was no key in the crack. In desperation, I sank onto the bed; I clearly imagined that, therefore, I would now eavesdrop, and already from the first phrases, from the first sounds of the conversation, I guessed that their conversation was secret and ticklish. Oh, of course, an honest and noble person should have stood up, even now, to come out and say loudly: ""I'm here, wait!"" - and, despite his ridiculous position, pass by; but I didn't get up and go out; he did not dare, he was frightened in the meanest way.","As I jumped into the bedroom and stumbled against the bed, I noticed to my relief that there was a door connecting that room with the kitchen, which meant that there was, after all, a possible escape for me. But when I tried to open it, I found to my horror that the door was locked and there was no key. Hopelessly I sank onto the bed. I knew now that I'd be forced to overhear a private conversation, which, from the few words I'd already taken in, was obviously a very secret one dealing with matters of a very delicate nature. Oh, I know only too well that a self-respecting and honorable man would have come out of hiding, even if only at the last moment, and warned them in a loud voice: ""Wait, I'm here!"" and, however ridiculous his position may have seemed to them, he would have got up and walked out right past them. But I didn't get up and I didn't walk out. I didn't have the courage. I chose the most despicable alternative.","After rushing into the bedroom and knocking against the bed, I noticed at once that there was a door leading from the bedroom into the kitchen, and so there was a way out of my horrible position, and I could make my escape but— oh, horror! the door was locked, and there was no key in it. I sank on the bed in despair; I realized that I should overhear their talk, and from the first sentence, from the first sound of their conversation, I guessed that they were discussing delicate and private matters. Oh, of course, a straightforward and honourable man should even then have got up, come out, said aloud, ""I'm here, stop!"" and, in spite of his ridiculous position, walked past them; but I did not get up, and did not come out ; I didn't dare, I was in a most despicable funk."

"На другой день я вышел из дому, хоть и в десять часов дня, но изо всех сил постарался уйти потихоньку, не простившись и не сказавшись; так сказать, ускользнул. Для чего так сделал – не знаю, но если б даже мама подглядела, что я выхожу, и заговорила со мной, то я бы ответил ей какой-нибудь злостью. Когда я очутился на улице и дохнул уличного холодного воздуху, то так и вздрогнул от сильнейшего ощущения – почти животного и которое я назвал бы плотоядным. Для чего я шел, куда я шел? Это было совершенно неопределенно и в то же время плотоядно. И страшно мне было и радостно – все вместе.","The next day I left the house, although at ten o'clock in the afternoon, but I did my best to leave quietly, without saying goodbye or saying; so to speak, slipped away. I don’t know why I did this, but even if my mother saw that I was leaving and spoke to me, I would answer her with some kind of anger. When I found myself on the street and breathed the cold street air, I shuddered from the strongest sensation - almost animal and which I would call carnivorous. Why did I go, where did I go? It was completely vague and at the same time carnivorous. And I was scared and happy - all together.","Although I didn't manage to leave the house before ten the following morning, I did my best to slip out unnoticed, without taking leave of anyone. I'm not sure why I wanted it that way, but I knew that if even Mother had seen me and said something I'd only have growled rudely at her. When I stepped out into the street and took in a chestful of cool fresh air, I shuddered all over with animal delight, I would even describe it as carnivorous. Where was I off to? For what purpose? It was all quite vague, but still I had that carnivorous feeling. I was frightened and joyful all at once.","Next day I went out of the house at ten o'clock in the morning, doing my utmost to steal out quietly without taking leave or saying anything.

"– Мы все наши двадцать лет, с твоею матерью, совершенно прожили молча, – начал он свою болтовню (в высшей степени выделанно и ненатурально), – и все, что было у нас, так и произошло молча. Главным характером всего двадцатилетия связи нашей было – безмолвие. Я думаю, мы даже ни разу не поссорились. Правда, я часто отлучался и оставлял ее одну, но кончалось тем, что всегда приезжал обратно. Nous revenons toujours,[37] и это уж такое основное свойство мужчин; у них это от великодушия. Если бы дело брака зависело от одних женщин – ни одного бы брака не уцелело. Смирение, безответность, приниженность и в то же время твердость, сила, настоящая сила – вот характер твоей матери. Заметь, что это лучшая из всех женщин, каких я встречал на свете. А что в ней сила есть – это я засвидетельствую: видал же я, как эта сила ее питала. Там, где касается, я не скажу убеждений – правильных убеждений тут быть не может, – но того, что считается у них убеждением, а стало быть, по-ихнему, и святым, там просто хоть на муки. Ну, а сам можешь заключить: похож ли я на мучителя? Вот почему я и предпочел почти во всем замолчать, а не потому только, что это легче, и, признаюсь, не раскаиваюсь. Таким образом, все обошлось само собою широко и гуманно, так что я себе даже никакой хвалы не приписываю. Скажу кстати, в скобках, что почему-то подозреваю, что она никогда не верила в мою гуманность, а потому всегда трепетала; но, трепеща, в то же время не поддалась ни на какую культуру. Они как-то это умеют, а мы тут чего-то не понимаем, и вообще они умеют лучше нашего обделывать свои дела. Они могут продолжать жить по-своему в самых ненатуральных для них положениях и в самых не ихних положениях оставаться совершенно самими собой. Мы так не умеем.","“All of our twenty years, with your mother, have lived completely in silence,” he began his chatter (in the highest degree of dressed up and unnatural), “and everything that we had happened in silence. The main character of the entire twenty years of our connection was silence. I don't think we even had a fight. True, I often went away and left her alone, but I always ended up coming back. Nous revenons toujours,[37] and this is such a basic quality of men; they have it out of generosity. If the matter of marriage depended on women alone, not a single marriage would have survived. Humility, irresponsibility, humiliation and at the same time firmness, strength, real strength - this is the character of your mother. Note that this is the best of all the women that I have met in the world. And that there is strength in her - I will testify: I saw how this strength nourished her. Where it concerns, I will not say convictions - there can be no correct convictions here - but what is considered by them as a conviction, and therefore, in their opinion, holy, is simply there even for torment. Well, you yourself can conclude: do I look like a tormentor? That is why I preferred to keep quiet about almost everything, and not just because it is easier, and, I confess, I do not repent. In this way, everything turned out by itself widely and humanely, so that I don’t even ascribe any praise to myself. I will say by the way, in parentheses, that for some reason I suspect that she never believed in my humanity, and therefore always trembled; but, trembling, at the same time did not succumb to any culture. They somehow know how, but we don’t understand something here, and in general they know how to handle their affairs better than we do. They can continue to live in their own way in the most unnatural positions for them, and in the most unnatural positions for them, remain completely themselves. We can't do that.","""The twenty years your mother and I have lived together have been spent in silence,"" he started off in an affected, unnatural tone, ""and all that passed between us happened without words. The main feature of our twenty-year union has been silence. I don't even believe that we ever quarreled. I often went off alone, leaving her behind, but I always came back in the end. Nous revenons toujours—that is typical of men and comes from their magnanimity. If marriage depended oh women alone, no marriage would last. Humility, meekness, self-deprecation, combined with firmness, strength—yes, real strength—all these make up your mother's character. Let me tell you, she's the best of all the women I've met in my life. As to her strength, I can testify to that, for I saw how that strength sustained her. When it comes, for instance, to standing up for her convictions—I'm not talking, of course, about convictions based on reason which she couldn't have, but rather of the things she holds sacred—she'd face torture for them. And since I'm not much of a torturer, as you can probably gather, I usually preferred to keep quiet. So the reason for my forbearance was not just that it was easier to say nothing, and, I must say, I'm not sorry I didn't interfere. Broadmindedness and tolerance was the easiest way under the circumstances, so I don't claim any credit. I'll say parenthetically, though, that she never trusted my tolerance and lived in fear and trembling. But, in fear and trembling as she was, she still firmly rejected whatever civilizing influence she happened to be exposed to. Humble people know how to reject things and, in general, they're better than we are at getting whatever they're after. They manage to live their lives out under the most unfavorable circumstances and remain true to themselves even when everything around them has become completely unfamiliar and strange. We could never do that.""","""Your mother and I have spent these twenty years together in silence,"" he began, prattling on (it was utterly affected and unnatural), ""and all that passed between us took place in silence. The chief characteristic of our twenty years' connection has been its—dumbness. I believe we have never once quarrelled. It is true I have often gone away and left her alone, but it has always ended in my coming back. Nous revenons toujours; indeed, it's a fundamental characteristic of men; it's due to their magnanimity. If marriage depended on women alone, not a single marriage would last. Meekness, submissiveness, self-abasement, and at the same time firmness, strength, real strength, that's your mother's character. Take note, that she's the best of all the women I've met in my life. And that she has strength I can bear witness: I have seen how that strength has supported her. When it's a matter, I won't say of convictions—convictions are out of the question— but what they look upon as convictions, and so, to their thinking, sacred, she is ready to face torture. Well, I leave you to judge, whether I am much like a torturer. That's why I have preferred to remain silent about almost everything, and not simply because it was more convenient, and I confess I don't regret it. In this way our life has gone on of itself on broad and humane lines, so that indeed I take no credit to myself for it. I must say by the way in parenthesis, that for some reason she never believed in my humanity, and so was always in a tremor; but, though she has trembled, she has never given in to any advanced ideas. They are so good at that, while we never understand that sort of thing, and in fact they are much better at managing things for themselves than we are. They are able to go on living their own lives in positions most unnatural to them, and in positions most strange to them they remain always the same. But we can't do that."""

"Большая часть его денег находилась в обороте. Он, уже после болезни, вошел участником в одну большую акционерную компанию, впрочем очень солидную. И хоть дела вели другие, но он тоже очень интересовался, посещал собрания акционеров, выбран был в члены-учредители, заседал в советах, говорил длинные речи, опровергал, шумел, и, очевидно, с удовольствием. Говорить речи ему очень понравилось: по крайней мере все могли видеть его ум. И вообще он ужасно как полюбил даже в самой интимной частной жизни вставлять в свой разговор особенно глубокомысленные вещи или бонмо; я это слишком понимаю. В доме, внизу, было устроено вроде домашней конторы, и один чиновник вел дела, счеты и книги, а вместе с тем и управлял домом. Этого чиновника, служившего, кроме того, на казенном месте, и одного было бы совершенно достаточно; но, по желанию самого князя, прибавили и меня, будто бы на помощь чиновнику; но я тотчас же был переведен в кабинет и часто, даже для виду, не имел пред собою занятий, ни бумаг, ни книг.","Most of his money was in circulation. He, already after his illness, became a participant in one large joint-stock company, however, a very solid one. And although others were doing business, he was also very interested, attended meetings of shareholders, was elected a founding member, sat on boards, spoke long speeches, refuted, made noise, and, obviously, with pleasure. He really enjoyed making speeches: at least everyone could see his mind. And in general, he terribly loved, even in the most intimate private life, to insert into his conversation especially profound things or bonmos; I understand it too much. In the house below, it was arranged like a home office, and one official kept affairs, accounts and books, and at the same time managed the house. This official, who, in addition, served in a state place, and one would be completely enough; but, at the request of the prince himself, they added me, as if to help the official; but I was immediately transferred to the study and often, even for appearances, had no studies before me, no papers, no books.","Most of his capital was invested. Even since his recovery, he had become a partner in a large joint-stock company, a very well-established one, as a matter of fact. And although he was not a member of the board of directors, he followed the operations of the company with great interest, attended the shareholders' meetings, was elected a founding member, made long speeches, opposed motions, made noise, and obviously had a marvelous time. He particularly liked speaking in public because it enabled everyone to judge his intelligence and sanity. And gradually he acquired, even in private conversation, the taste for profound sayings and bon mots, which I can very well understand. On the ground floor of his house he had set up something like a business office with a clerk to attend to the accounts, keep the books, and also manage the house. This clerk could cope quite adequately with these tasks, even though he worked only part time since he was also employed in a government department. Nevertheless, in compliance with Prince Sokolsky's express wishes, I was officially appointed to assist that clerk. But in no time I was transferred to the prince's private study upstairs and often sat there without any accounts or ledgers in front of me to keep up appearances.","The greater part of his money was invested.

He was very fond of making speeches: every one could judge of his brain anyway. And in general he developed a great fancy for introducing profound reflections and bon mots in his conversation, even in the intimacy of private life. I quite understand it.

"И вот прямо скажу: понять не могу до сих пор, каким это образом тогда Оля, такая недоверчивая, с первого почти слова начала его слушать? Пуще всего обеих нас привлекло тогда, что был у него такой серьезный вид, строгий даже, говорит тихо, обстоятельно и все так вежливо, – куды вежливо, почтительно даже, – а меж тем никакого такого исканья в нем не видно: прямо видно, что пришел человек от чистого сердца. «Я, говорит, ваше объявление в газете прочел, вы, говорит, не так, сударыня, его написали, так что даже повредить себе тем самым можете». И стал он объяснять, признаться, не поняла я, про арифметику тут что-то, только Оля, смотрю, покраснела и вся словно оживилась, слушает, в разговор вступила так охотно (да и умный же человек, должно быть!), слышу, даже благодарит его. Расспросил ее про все так обстоятельно, и видно, что в Москве подолгу живал, и директрису гимназии, оказалось, лично знает. «Уроки я вам, говорит, найду непременно, потому что я со многими здесь знаком и многих влиятельных даже лиц просить могу, так что если даже пожелаете постоянного места, то и то можно иметь в виду… а покамест простите, говорит, меня за один прямой к вам вопрос: не могу ли я сейчас быть вам чем полезным? Не я вам, говорит, а вы мне, напротив, тем самым сделаете удовольствие, коли допустите пользу оказать вам какую ни есть. Пусть это будет, говорит, за вами долг, и как только получите место, то в самое короткое время можете со мной поквитаться. Я же, верьте чести моей, если б сам когда потом впал в такую же нужду, а вы, напротив, были бы всем обеспечены, – то прямо бы к вам пришел за малою помощью, жену бы и дочь мою прислал» …То есть не припомню я вам всех его слов, только я тут прослезилась, потому вижу, и у Оли вздрогнули от благодарности губки: «Если и принимаю, – отвечает она ему, – то потому, что доверяюсь честному и гуманному человеку, который бы мог быть моим отцом»… Прекрасно она тут так сказала ему, коротко и благородно: «гуманному, говорит, человеку». Он тотчас встал: «Непременно, непременно, говорит, доставлю вам уроки и место; с сего же дня займусь, потому что вы к тому совсем достаточный имеете аттестат»… А я и забыла сказать, что он с самого начала, как вошел, все ее документы из гимназии осмотрел, показала она ему, и сам ее в разных предметах экзаменовал… «Ведь он меня, маменька, – говорит мне потом Оля, – из предметов экзаменовал, и какой он, говорит, умный, в кои-то веки с таким развитым и образованным человеком поговоришь»… И вся-то она так и сияет. Деньги шестьдесят рублей на столе лежат: «Уберите, говорит, маменька: место получим, первым долгом как можно скорей отдадим, докажем, что мы честные, а что мы деликатные, то он уже видел это». Потом помолчала, вижу, так она глубоко дышит: «Знаете, – говорит вдруг мне, – маменька, кабы мы были грубые, то мы бы от него, может, по гордости нашей, и не приняли, а что мы теперь приняли, то тем самым только деликатность нашу доказали ему, что во всем ему доверяем, как почтенному седому человеку, не правда ли?» Я сначала не так поняла да говорю: «Почему, Оля, от благородного и богатого человека благодеяния не принять, коли он сверх того доброй души человек?» Нахмурилась она на меня: «Нет, говорит, маменька, это не то, не благодеяние нужно, а „гуманность“ его, говорит, дорога. А деньги так даже лучше бы было нам и совсем не брать, маменька: коли уж он место обещался достать, то и того достаточно… хоть мы и нуждаемся». – «Ну, говорю, Оля, нужды-то наши таковы, что отказаться никак нельзя», – усмехнулась даже я. Ну, рада я про себя, только она мне через час и ввернула:","And I’ll say frankly: I still can’t understand how Olya, so incredulous, began to listen to him from the first almost word? What attracted us both most of all then was that he had such a serious look, even stern, that he spoke quietly, in detail, and everything was so polite - where polite, respectful even - and meanwhile, no such searching is visible in him: it is directly visible that a man came from a pure heart. “I, he says, read your ad in the newspaper, you, he says, is not right, madam, you wrote it, so you can even hurt yourself by doing so.” And he began to explain, to confess, I didn’t understand, there’s something about arithmetic, only Olya, I look, blushed and seemed to perk up, listens, entered into a conversation so willingly (and a smart person, it must be!), I hear, even thanks him. I asked her about everything in such detail, and it is clear that he lived in Moscow for a long time, and it turned out that he personally knew the headmistress of the gymnasium. “I will certainly find lessons for you, he says, because I am familiar with many people here and I can even ask many influential people, so even if you wish for a permanent position, then you can keep that in mind ... but for now, forgive me, he says, for one direct question to you: can I be of some help to you now? It’s not I you, he says, but you, on the contrary, will please me, if you allow any benefit to be rendered to you. Let it be, he says, your duty, and as soon as you get a place, you can get even with me in the shortest possible time. But I, believe my honor, if I myself later fell into the same need, and you, on the contrary, were provided with everything, then I would come directly to you for little help, I would send my wife and daughter ”... That is, not I’ll remember all his words to you, only I shed a tear here, because I see, and Olya’s lips shuddered with gratitude: “If I accept,” she answers him, “it’s because I trust an honest and humane person who could be my father ""... It was wonderful that she said this to him, briefly and nobly:"" to a humane, she says, to a man. He immediately got up: “Certainly, certainly, he says, I will bring you lessons and a place; I’ll get busy from this very day, because you have a completely sufficient certificate for that ”... And I forgot to say that from the very beginning, as he entered, he examined all her documents from the gymnasium, she showed him, and he himself examined her in various subjects ... “After all, he me, mama,” Olya tells me later, “examined me from the subjects, and what he, he says, is smart, for once you will talk with such a developed and educated person” ... And all she shines like that. The money is sixty rubles on the table: “Take it away, mother says: we’ll get a place, we’ll pay off the first debt as soon as possible, we’ll prove that we are honest, and that we are delicate, he has already seen this.” Then she paused, I see how she breathes deeply: “You know,” she suddenly says to me, “mother, if we were rude, then we would not have accepted him, maybe, due to our pride, and what we now accepted, then only our delicacy proved to him that we trust him in everything, as a respectable gray-haired man, isn’t it? At first, I misunderstood and said: “Why, Olya, can’t you accept a good deed from a noble and rich person, if he is a man of a good soul, moreover?” She frowned at me: “No,” she says, mother, this is not what is needed, not a beneficence, but his “humanity”, she says, is dear. And it would be even better for us not to take money at all, mother: if he promised to get a place, then that’s enough ... even though we need it. “Well, I say, Olya, our needs are such that it’s impossible to refuse,” even I chuckled. Well, I'm glad to myself, only she told me an hour later:","""And now let me tell you this: I still cannot understand why Olga, usually so distrustful of people, listened to him almost from the moment he started talking. What impressed us both at the time was his serious, even stern air, the quiet, effective way he had of expressing himself, while always remaining courteous or, even more than that, considerate toward us without any possible ulterior motive. It was evident that he'd come to see us with the purest intentions. "" 'I have read your advertisement in the paper, ma'am, and I thought I ought to tell you that it wasn't worded properly, that, the way it is, it might even attract undesirable responses.' And he started explaining why. I admit I couldn't follow everything he said, especially what he said about the arithmetic, but Olga went quite red in the face and answered him and sort of livened up as they spoke. She talked to him willingly (he sounded so intelligent!) and I even heard, to my great surprise, her thanking him for coming. He questioned her with interest about our life, and it turned out he'd lived in Moscow for a long time and knew well the principal of the high school Olga had gone to. "" I'll find lessons for you here,' he said. 'I'm sure there'll be no problem because I know many people in Petersburg, and some of them are even quite influential. So even if you were interested in a permanent position, I have no doubt that one could be found too. . . . But in the meantime,' he said, 'you must forgive me if I ask you a blunt question : Isn't there anything I could do for you right now? If so, it would be I who'd be obliged to you. Let it be a loan,' he said, 'and you'll pay it back in no time after you start working. I give you my word of honor that if I ever find myself in dire need one day when you're well off, I'll send my wife or my daughter to you to ask for a small loan. . . .' ""Well, I can't remember everything he said, but I couldn't hold back my tears the moment I noticed that Olga's lips were trembling from gratitude too. "" 'If I accept your offer,' she said to him, 'it's only because I trust an honorable and kind man who could have been my father. . . .' ""She put it very well and it came out so dignified when she called him an honorable and kind man! ""He got up immediately: I'll find you lessons, you can rest assured of that. I'll get busy on it right away, it won't be difficult at all. You're a perfectly qualified teacher. . . .' ""Ah, yes, I forgot to tell you that earlier he had asked to see Olga's graduation certificate and had even tested her a little in arithmetic and other subjects. ' He examined me, Mother, in every subject,' Olga said to me later; 'he's such a well-educated and intelligent man! One doesn't often have the opportunity to talk to one like him!' She was all radiant now. ' Put this money away, Mother,' she said about the sixty rubles he had left on the table. ' We'll pay him back first thing when I get a job and he'll see that we're as honest as we are proud, which he already understood.' She remained silent for a moment and sighed. ' You know, Mother,' she said after a while, 'if we'd been ordinary, unrefined people, we might have rejected his offer out of false pride, but, by accepting the loan, we have proved our refinement to him, since it shows we trust him implicitly as an honorable, gray-haired man. Don't you agree, Mother?' ""I didn't quite understand her at first. ' Why shouldn't one accept help from an honorable and rich man if, on top of everything else, he also happens to be kind, Olga?' ""'No, Mother,' she said, and frowned, 'it's not his kindness it's his human understanding that I appreciate. As to his money, I'd really have preferred it if he hadn't offered it to us and perhaps we'd better do without it : it's good enough to know that he's promised to get me a job. I think that would be best, although we do need money. . . .' "" 'Well, you know, Olga, our situation is pretty desperate and I don't think we can afford to refuse the money.' I even laughed a little. Things were looking up now, I thought, but before an hour had passed Olga said to me:","And I must say I can't understand, even now, how Olya, who was always so mistrustful, was ready to listen to him almost at the first word. What attracted us both more than anything was that he had such a grave, almost stern air; he spoke gently, impressively, and so politely—more than politely, respectfully even—and yet at the same time he showed no sign of trying to make up to us: it was plain to see he had come with a pure heart. ' I read your advertisement in the paper,' said he. ' You did not word it suitably, madam, and you may damage your prospects by that.' And he began explaining—I must own I did not understand—something about arithmetic, but I saw that Olya flushed and seemed to brighten up altogether. She listened and talked readily (and, to be sure, he must be a clever man!); I heard her even thank him. He questioned her so minutely about everything, and it seemed that he had lived a long time in Moscow, and it turned out that he knew the head mistress of the high school. ' I will be sure to find you lessons,' said he, 'for I know a great many people here, and I can, in fact, apply to many influential people, so that if you would prefer a permanent situation we might look out for that… . Meanwhile,' said he, 'forgive me one direct question: can I be of some use to you at once? It will be your doing me a favour, not my doing you one,' said he, 'if you will allow me to be of use to you in any way. Let it be a loan,' said he, 'and as soon as you have a situation, in a very short time, you will be able to repay me. Believe me, on my honour,' said he, 'if ever I were to come to poverty and you had plenty of everything I would come straight to you for some little help. I would send my wife and daughter' … at least, I don't remember all his words, only I was moved to tears, for I saw that Olya's lips were trembling with gratitude too. ' If I take it,' she answered him, 'it is because I trust an honourable and humane man, who might have been my father… .' That was very well said by her, briefly and with dignity. ' A humane man,' said she. He stood up at once: 'I will get you lessons and a situation without fail. I will set to work this very day, for you have quite a satisfactory diploma too… .' I forgot to say that he looked through all her school certificates when he first came in; she showed them to him, and he examined her in several subjects… . ' You see, he examined me, mamma,' Olya said to me afterwards, 'and what a clever man he is,' she said; 'it is not often one speaks to such a well-educated, cultured man… .' And she was quite radiant. The money—sixty roubles, lay on the table: ' Take it, mamma,' said she; 'when I get a situation we will pay it back as soon as possible. We will show that we are honest and that we have delicacy: he has seen that already, though.' Then she paused. I saw her draw a deep breath. ' Do you know, mamma,' she said to me suddenly, 'if we had been coarse we should perhaps have refused to take it through pride, but by taking it now we only show our delicacy of feeling and that we trust him completely, out of respect for his grey hair, don't we?' At first I did not quite understand: ' But why, Olya, not accept the benevolence a wealthy and honourable man if he has a good heart too?' She scowled at me. ' No, mamma,' she said, 'that's not it; I don't want benevolence, but his humanity is precious. And it would have been better really not to have taken the money at all, since he has promised to get me a situation; that's enough … though we are in need.' ' Well, Olya,' said I, 'our need is so great that we could not have refused it.' I actually laughed. Well, I was pleased, but an hour later she turned to me: 'Don't spend that money yet, mamma,' said she resolutely. '"

"– Ты все узнаешь, – сказал он, с задумчивою улыбкой, – и, уж конечно, я, что надо, не потаю от тебя, потому что затем тебя и привел; но теперь пока это все отложим. Видишь, друг мой, я давно уже знал, что у нас есть дети, уже с детства задумывающиеся над своей семьей, оскорбленные неблагообразием отцов своих и среды своей. Я наметил этих задумывающихся еще с моей школы и заключил тогда, что все это потому, что они слишком рано завидуют. Заметь, однако, что я и сам был из задумывающихся детей, но… извини, мой милый, я удивительно как рассеян. Я хотел только выразить, как постоянно я боялся здесь за тебя почти все это время. Я всегда воображал тебя одним из тех маленьких, но сознающих свою даровитость и уединяющихся существ. Я тоже, как и ты, никогда не любил товарищей. Беда этим существам, оставленным на одни свои силы и грезы и с страстной, слишком ранней и почти мстительной жаждой благообразия, именно – «мстительной». Но довольно, милый: я опять уклонился… Я еще прежде, чем начал любить тебя, уже воображал тебя и твои уединенные, одичавшие мечты… Но довольно; я, собственно, забыл, о чем стал говорить. Впрочем, все же надо было это высказать. А прежде, прежде что бы я мог тебе сказать? Теперь я вижу твой взгляд на мне и знаю, что на меня смотрит мой сын, а я ведь даже вчера еще не мог поверить, что буду когда-нибудь, как сегодня, сидеть и говорить с моим мальчиком.","“You will know everything,” he said, with a thoughtful smile, “and, of course, I won’t hide from you what is necessary, because then I brought you; but for now let's put it all aside. You see, my friend, I have known for a long time that we have children who have been thinking about their family since childhood, offended by the ugliness of their fathers and their environment. I identified these thinkers from my school and concluded then that it was all because they envied too early. Note, however, that I myself was one of the thinking children, but ... excuse me, my dear, I'm surprisingly absent-minded. I just wanted to express how constantly I was afraid here for you almost all this time. I've always imagined you as one of those small, but self-conscious and reclusive creatures. I, like you, have never loved my comrades. The trouble is for these beings, left to their own strength and dreams and with a passionate, too early and almost vengeful thirst for goodness, namely, “vengeful”. But enough, my dear: I evaded again... Even before I began to love you, I was already imagining you and your solitary, wild dreams... But enough; I actually forgot what I was talking about. However, it still needed to be said. Before, before, what could I tell you? Now I see your eyes on me and I know that my son is looking at me, and even yesterday I still could not believe that I would someday, like today, sit and talk with my boy.","""You'll learn about it in time,"" he said with a faraway smile, ""and you may rest assured that I'll tell you everything you need to know because that's why I brought you here. I won't keep anything secret from you. But, just now, that can wait. You see, my friend, I've known for a long time that there are children who, from their very early years, brood about their parents and feel insulted by the ugly behavior of their fathers and the moral ugliness of their environment. I discovered such brooding children back in my own school days and I decided they were like that because they were prematurely envious. . . . But perhaps I decided that because I myself was a brooding child. . . . Forgive me, my boy, I keep wandering off the subject. . . . What I was trying to say was that I was worrying almost constantly about you during all that time. I'd always imagined you were one of those young creatures who are aware of their rich endowments and who try to withdraw into themselves. Just like you, at school, I never liked other boys. So I know how hard life is for those young creatures left to their own resources and daydreams and possessed by a passionate, precocious, and almost vengeful longing for 'beauty,' yes, vengeful. But now I've slipped off the subject once more. Even before I got to love you, I imagined your solitary, wild daydreams. . . . Ah, I forgot again what I was going to say. Still, I had to tell you that too. . . . But what could I possibly have said to you before it happened? Now I can feel your eyes on me and I know that it's my son who's looking at me. But only yesterday I couldn't believe that one day I'd be sitting and talking with my own son.","""You shall know all about it,"" he said, with a dreamy smile, ""and, of course, I shall not conceal from you anything you ought to know; for that's what I brought you here for; but let us put that off for a time. You see, my dear boy, I knew long ago that there are children who brood from their earliest years over their family through being humiliated by the unseemliness of their surroundings and of their parents' lives. I noticed these brooding natures while I was still at school, and I concluded then that it all came from their being prematurely envious. Though I was myself a brooding child, yet … excuse me, my dear, I'm wonderfully absent-minded. I only meant to say that almost all this time I have been continually uneasy about you. I always imagined you one of those little creatures doomed to solitude, though conscious of being gifted. Like you, I was never fond of my schoolfellows. It is sad for those natures who are flung back on their own resources and dreams, especially when they have a passionate, premature and almost vindictive longing for 'seemliness'—yes, 'vindictive.' But enough, dear boy, I'm wandering from the point. Before I had begun to love you, I was picturing you and your solitary wild dreams… . But enough; I've actually forgotten what I had begun to speak about. But all this had to be said, however. But what could I have said to you before? Now I see your eyes looking at me, and I feel it's my SON looking at me. Why, even yesterday I could not have believed that I should ever be sitting and talking to my boy as I am to-day."""
"И вдруг он склонил свою хорошенькую головку мне на плечо и – заплакал. Мне стало очень, очень его жалко.

"Я – кончивший курс гимназист, а теперь мне уже двадцать первый год. Фамилия моя Долгорукий, а юридический отец мой – Макар Иванов Долгорукий, бывший дворовый господ Версиловых. Таким образом, я – законнорожденный, хотя я, в высшей степени, незаконный сын, и происхождение мое не подвержено ни малейшему сомнению. Дело произошло таким образом: двадцать два года назад помещик Версилов (это-то и есть мой отец), двадцати пяти лет, посетил свое имение в Тульской губернии. Я предполагаю, что в это время он был еще чем-то весьма безличным. Любопытно, что этот человек, столь поразивший меня с самого детства, имевший такое капитальное влияние на склад всей души моей и даже, может быть, еще надолго заразивший собою все мое будущее, этот человек даже и теперь в чрезвычайно многом остается для меня совершенною загадкой. Но, собственно, об этом после. Этого так не расскажешь. Этим человеком и без того будет наполнена вся тетрадь моя.","I am a high school student who has completed the course, and now I am already twenty-one years old. My surname is Dolgoruky, and my legal father is Makar Ivanov Dolgoruky, a former yard lord of the Versilovs. Thus, I am a legitimate son, although I am an illegitimate son in the highest degree, and my origin is not subject to the slightest doubt. It happened in this way: twenty-two years ago, the landowner Versilov (this is my father), twenty-five years old, visited his estate in the Tula province. I guess at this time he was still something quite impersonal. It is curious that this man, who so struck me from my very childhood, who had such a capital influence on the warehouse of my whole soul, and even, perhaps, infected my whole future with himself for a long time to come, this man even now in extremely many ways remains a complete mystery to me. But, actually, more about that later. You don't say it like that. This person will already fill my entire notebook.","I'm a high-school graduate and I'm nineteen. My name is Dolgoruky and my legal father is Makar Ivanovich Dolgoruky, a former serf on the Versilov estate. That makes me legitimate, although in fact, of course, I'm as illegitimate as they come without there being the slightest doubt about my origin. This is how it happened. Some twenty years ago a twenty-five-year-old landowner named Versilov (my real father) went to spend some time on his estate in Tula Province. I don't imagine that at that early date he was the striking personality he is today. It seems rather strange that this man, who has made such a strong impression on me ever since I first set eyes on him, who has molded my very way of thinking, and who has probably affected the course of my life for a long time to come, should be, to this day, in many ways a complete enigma to me. But I'll come back to that later, for it's impossible to explain what I mean at this point. Besides, I'll have a lot to say about him as I go on with my story.","I have passed the leaving examination at the grammar school, and now I am in my twenty-first year. My surname is Dolgoruky, and my legal father is Makar Ivanov Dolgoruky, formerly a serf in the household of the Versilovs. In this way I am a legitimate son, although I am, as a matter of fact, conspicuously illegitimate, and there is not the faintest doubt about my origin. The facts are as follows. Twenty-two years ago Versilov (that is my father), being twenty-five years old, visited his estate in the province of Tula. I imagine that at that time his character was still quite unformed. It is curious that this man who, even in my childhood, made such an impression upon me, who had such a crucial influence on the whole bent of my mind, and who perhaps has even cast his shadow over the whole of my future, still remains, even now, a complete enigma to me in many respects. Of this, more particulars later. There is no describing him straight off. My whole manuscript will be full of this man, anyway."

"Только что он, давеча, прочел это письмо, как вдруг ощутил в себе самое неожиданное явление: в первый раз, в эти роковые два года, он не почувствовал ни малейшей к ней ненависти и ни малейшего сотрясения, подобно тому как недавно еще «сошел с ума» при одном только слухе о Бьоринге. «Напротив, я ей послал благословение от всего сердца», – проговорил он мне с глубоким чувством. Я выслушал эти слова с восхищением. Значит, все, что было в нем страсти, муки, исчезло разом, само собою, как сон, как двухлетнее наваждение. Еще не веря себе, он поспешил было давеча к маме – и что же: он вошел именно в ту минуту, когда она стала свободною и завещавший ее ему вчера старик умер.

Немного спустя он бросился искать меня – и эту столь скорую мысль его обо мне я никогда не забуду.","He had just read this letter just now, when he suddenly felt in himself the most unexpected phenomenon: for the first time, in these fateful two years, he did not feel the slightest hatred for her and not the slightest concussion, just as he had recently ""departed from mind"" at the mere rumor of Björing. “On the contrary, I sent her a blessing from the bottom of my heart,” he said to me with deep feeling. I listened to these words with admiration. This means that everything that was in him of passion, torment, disappeared at once, of itself, like a dream, like a two-year obsession. Still not believing himself, he hurried this very evening to his mother - and what happened: he entered at the very moment when she became free and the old man who bequeathed her to him yesterday died. It was these two coincidences that shook his soul. A little later, he rushed to look for me - and I will never forget this so quick thought of him about me.","When he'd read the letter upon receiving it earlier that day, he'd suddenly realized with surprise that, for the first time in those two turbulent years, he did not feel any hatred for her, nor anything like the shock that had all but driven him out of his mind when he'd first heard about Bjoring. "" As a matter of fact, I sent her my best wishes and my blessings with complete sincerity,"" he told me with deep feeling. I registered his words with elation. This meant that all the passions and torments that had been inhabiting him until then had vanished, like a two-year-long obsessive dream. Still unable to believe altogether in his liberation, he rushed to see Mother and arrived at the house precisely at the moment she too became free, when the old man who had bequeathed her to him died. And it was the coincidence of these two events that had shaken him to his very foundations. Shortly after that, he'd gone out to look for me, and I'll never forget that he thought of me so soon.","As soon as he had read the letter that day, he was aware of a new sensation: for the first time in those fatal two years he felt not the slightest hatred for her, or the slightest shock of emotion, such as had ""driven him out of his mind"" at a mere rumour of Büring. ""On the contrary, I sent her my blessing, with perfect sincerity,"" he told me, with deep feeling. I heard these words with ecstasy. Then all the passion and agony that had possessed him had vanished all at once of itself, like a dream, like an obsession that had lasted two years. Hardly yet able to believe in himself he hastened to mother's and—arrived at the very moment when she was set free by the death of the old man who had bequeathed her to him. The coincidence of these two events had deeply stirred his soul. Not long afterwards he rushed to find me—and that immediate thought of me I shall never forget."

"Так мечтая и весь закопавшись в фантазию, я и не заметил, что дошел наконец до дому, то есть до маминой квартиры. Даже не заметил, как вошел в квартиру; но только что я вступил в нашу крошечную переднюю, как уже сразу понял, что у нас произошло нечто необычайное. В комнатах говорили громко, вскрикивали, а мама, слышно было, плакала. В дверях меня чуть не сбила с ног Лукерья, стремительно пробежавшая из комнаты Макара Ивановича в кухню. Я сбросил шубу и вошел к Макару Ивановичу, потому что там все столпились.","So dreaming and all digging into fantasy, I did not notice that I had finally reached the house, that is, my mother's apartment. I didn't even notice how I entered the apartment; but as soon as I stepped into our tiny antechamber, I immediately realized that something extraordinary had happened to us. They were talking loudly in the rooms, screaming, and my mother could be heard crying.

"Заметь себе, друг мой, странность: всякий француз может служить не только своей Франции, но даже и человечеству, единственно под тем лишь условием, что останется наиболее французом; равно – англичанин и немец. Один лишь русский, даже в наше время, то есть гораздо еще раньше, чем будет подведен всеобщий итог, получил уже способность становиться наиболее русским именно лишь тогда, когда он наиболее европеец. Это и есть самое существенное национальное различие наше от всех, и у нас на этот счет – как нигде. Я во Франции – француз, с немцем – немец, с древним греком – грек и тем самым наиболее русский. Тем самым я – настоящий русский и наиболее служу для России, ибо выставляю ее главную мысль. Я – пионер этой мысли. Я тогда эмигрировал, но разве я покинул Россию? Нет, я продолжал ей служить. Пусть бы я и ничего не сделал в Европе, пусть я ехал только скитаться (да я и знал, что еду только скитаться), но довольно и того, что я ехал с моею мыслью и с моим сознанием. Я повез туда мою русскую тоску. О, не одна только тогдашняя кровь меня так испугала, и даже не Тюильри, а все, что должно последовать. Им еще долго суждено драться, потому что они – еще слишком немцы и слишком французы и не кончили свое дело еще в этих ролях. А до тех пор мне жаль разрушения. Русскому Европа так же драгоценна, как Россия: каждый камень в ней мил и дорог. Европа так же была отечеством нашим, как и Россия. О, более! Нельзя более любить Россию, чем люблю ее я, но я никогда не упрекал себя за то, что Венеция, Рим, Париж, сокровища их наук и искусств, вся история их – мне милей, чем Россия. О, русским дороги эти старые чужие камни, эти чудеса старого Божьего мира, эти осколки святых чудес; и даже это нам дороже, чем им самим! У них теперь другие мысли и другие чувства, и они перестали дорожить старыми камнями… Там консерватор всего только борется за существование; да и петролейщик лезет лишь из-за права на кусок. Одна Россия живет не для себя, а для мысли, и согласись, мой друг, знаменательный факт, что вот уже почти столетие, как Россия живет решительно не для себя, а для одной лишь Европы! А им? О, им суждены страшные муки прежде, чем достигнуть царствия Божия.","Note to yourself, my friend, the strangeness: every Frenchman can serve not only his France, but even humanity, only on the condition that he remains the most French; equally - English and German. Only a Russian, even in our time, that is, much earlier than the general result will be summed up, has already acquired the ability to become the most Russian precisely when he is the most European. This is the most essential national difference between us and everyone else, and in this respect we are like nowhere else. In France I am a Frenchman, with a German I am a German, with an ancient Greek I am a Greek and thus most Russian. Thus, I am a real Russian and serve Russia the most, for I present its main idea. I am the pioneer of this idea. I then emigrated, but did I leave Russia? No, I continued to serve her. Even if I didn’t do anything in Europe, even if I went only to wander (and I knew that I was going only to wander), but it’s enough that I went with my thought and with my consciousness. I took my Russian melancholy there. Oh, not only the blood of that time scared me so much, and not even the Tuileries, but everything that should follow. They are destined to fight for a long time yet, because they are still too German and too French and have not yet finished their work in these roles. Until then, I'm sorry for the destruction. To the Russian, Europe is as precious as Russia: every stone in it is sweet and dear. Europe has also been our fatherland, just like Russia. Oh more! It is impossible to love Russia more than I love her, but I have never reproached myself for the fact that Venice, Rome, Paris, the treasures of their sciences and arts, their whole history are dearer to me than Russia. Oh, these old foreign stones are dear to Russians, these miracles of the old God's world, these fragments of holy miracles; and even that is dearer to us than to them! They now have other thoughts and other feelings, and they have ceased to value old stones ... There, the conservative is only fighting for existence; and the petroleum worker climbs only because of the right to a piece. Russia alone lives not for itself, but for thought, and you must admit, my friend, it is a significant fact that for almost a century now Russia has been living decisively not for itself, but for Europe alone! What about them? Oh, they are destined for terrible torments before reaching the kingdom of God.","""It's a strange fact, my boy: in order to serve mankind as a whole, and even just France for that matter, a Frenchman must remain thoroughly French. And the same goes for an Englishman or a German. Only a Russian—even as of today, that is, long before the existence of the ideal of universality—can reach his utmost Russian essence solely when he also feels completely European. And this is the most important difference between us and all the others, for we are different from the rest. In France I'm a Frenchman; with a German I'm a German; and faced with an ancient Greek, I would feel like a Hellene. And this way I, a true Russian, am serving Russia best by incarnating her basic idea. I'm a pioneer of that Russian idea. Yes, I emigrated, but did that really mean that I deserted Russia? No, I went on serving her. Even if I did nothing in Europe but roam around (and I knew that was all I was going to do), the fact that I carried with me my Russian idea and my Russian view of the world was a sufficient contribution in itself. ""I bore within me my Russian anguish about Europe. Oh, it wasn't just the blood that was being shed at that time that depressed me, nor the burning of the Tuileries, but rather all the things that were to follow. Those nations are doomed to go on fighting for years to come because they're still too German and too French and they haven't yet finished playing these roles. But, in the meantime, I'm sad about the destruction that's going on. To a Russian, Europe is just as dear as Russia and every stone there is precious to him. Europe has always been our homeland as much as Russia. In a way, even more so! I believe no one loves Russia more than I do, but I've never felt guilty for feeling that Venice, Rome, and Paris—with all their treasures of art and human achievement, with all their history—are dearer to me than Russia. Oh, how dear are those ancient foreign stones, those marvels of God's world, those relics of holy miracles to the Russians! Indeed, they are dearer to us than to them, the natives of those lands. Their thoughts and feelings are no longer the same and they no longer treasure their own ancient stones. . . . Over there, the conservative merely fights back to preserve his existence while the revolutionary incendiary acts only in the name of his right to his share. Of all the countries in the world, only Russia exists not just for her own sake but for the idea she embodies, and I want you to note, my dear boy, that, for almost a century now, Russia has lived not for herself alone but for Europe as a whole! And the other nations? The rest of them are doomed to go through dreadful ordeals before they gain the Kingdom of God.""","""Take note, my dear, of a strange fact: every Frenchman can serve not only his France, but humanity, only on condition that he remains French to the utmost possible degree, and it's the same for the Englishman and the German. Only to the Russian, even in our day, has been vouchsafed the capacity to become most of all Russian only when he is most European, and this is true even in our day, that is, long before the millennium has been reached. That is the most essential difference between us Russians and all the rest, and in that respect the position in Russia is as nowhere else. I am in France a Frenchman, with a German I am a German, with the ancient Greeks I am a Greek, and by that very fact I am most typically a Russian. By that very fact I am a true Russian, and am most truly serving Russia, for I am bringing out her leading idea. I am a pioneer of that idea. I was an emigrant then, but had I forsaken Russia? No, I was still serving her. What though I did nothing in Europe, what if I only went there as a wanderer (indeed, I know that was so) it was enough that I went there with my thought and my consciousness. I carried thither my Russian melancholy. Oh, it was not only the bloodshed in those days that appalled me, and it was not the Tuileries, but all that was bound to follow it. They are doomed to strife for a long time yet, because they are still too German and too French, and have not yet finished struggling in those national characters. And I regret the destruction that must come before they have finished. To the Russian, Europe is as precious as Russia: every stone in her is cherished and dear. Europe is as much our fatherland as Russia. Oh, even more so. No one could love Russia more than I do, but I never reproached myself that Venice, Rome, Paris, the treasures of their arts and sciences, their whole history, are dearer to me than Russia.

There the conservative struggles only for existence; and the vitriol-thrower is only fighting for a crust of bread. Only Russia lives not for herself, but for an idea, and, you must admit, my dear, the remarkable fact that for almost the last hundred years Russia has lived absolutely not for herself, but only for the other States of Europe!

"Прибыв на место, я прошел в углубление двора обозначенного в объявлении дома и вошел в квартиру госпожи Лебрехт. Квартира состояла из прихожей и четырех небольших, невысоких комнат. В первой комнате из прихожей стояла толпа, человек даже до тридцати; из них наполовину торгующихся, а другие, по виду их, были или любопытные, или любители, или подосланные от Лебрехт; были и купцы, и жиды, зарившиеся на золотые вещи, и несколько человек из одетых «чисто». Даже физиономии иных из этих господ врезались в моей памяти. В комнате направо, в открытых дверях, как раз между дверцами, вдвинут был стол, так что в ту комнату войти было нельзя: там лежали описанные и продаваемые вещи. Налево была другая комната, но двери в нее были притворены, хотя и отпирались поминутно на маленькую щелку, в которую, видно было, кто-то выглядывал – должно быть, из многочисленного семейства госпожи Лебрехт, которой, естественно, в это время было очень стыдно. За столом между дверями, лицом к публике, сидел на стуле господин судебный пристав, при знаке, и производил распродажу вещей. Я застал уже дело почти в половине; как вошел – протеснился к самому столу. Продавались бронзовые подсвечники. Я стал глядеть.","Arriving at the place, I went into the deepening of the courtyard of the house indicated in the advertisement and entered the apartment of Mrs. Lebrecht. The apartment consisted of an entrance hall and four small, low rooms. In the first room there was a crowd from the hallway, even up to thirty people; of them half-bargained, while others, by their appearance, were either curious, or lovers, or sent from Lebrecht; there were merchants, and Jews who coveted gold things, and a few people dressed “cleanly”. Even the faces of some of these gentlemen are engraved in my memory. In the room to the right, in the open doors, just between the doors, a table was pushed in, so that it was impossible to enter that room: there were things described and sold. To the left was another room, but the doors to it were closed, although they were constantly unlocked by a small crack, into which, it was clear, someone was looking out - must be from the large family of Mrs. Lebrecht, who, naturally, at that time was very ashamed . At a table between the doors, facing the public, the bailiff sat on a chair, at a sign, and made a sale of things. I found it almost halfway through; as he entered, he made his way to the table itself. Sold bronze candlesticks. I began to look.","I arrived at the address, entered the yard, and, following the instructions in the advertisement, found Mrs. Lebrecht's apartment.

There were a few merchants, some Jews eying gold items, and a few members of the well-dressed class. Some of all those faces remain engraved in my memory. In the doorway leading to the room on the right was a table which barred access to that room: the items listed for sale lay on that table. The door leading to the room on the left was closed, although someone inside kept opening it a crack and peeping out, probably a member of Mrs. Lebrecht's numerous family, who naturally enough must have felt very embarrassed by the proceedings. At the table in the doorway sat a man who, judging by his badge, must have been a court official, and he conducted the auction. When I arrived, the auction was half over.

"Я рассуждал так: дело с письмом о наследстве есть дело совести, и я, выбирая Васина в судьи, тем самым выказываю ему всю глубину моего уважения, что, уж конечно, должно было ему польстить. Разумеется, я и взаправду был озабочен этим письмом и действительно убежден в необходимости третейского решения; но подозреваю, однако, что и тогда уже мог бы вывернуться из затруднения без всякой посторонней помощи. И главное, сам знал про это; именно: стоило только отдать письмо самому Версилову из рук в руки, а что он там захочет, пусть так и делает: вот решение. Ставить же самого себя высшим судьей и решителем в деле такого сорта было даже совсем неправильно. Устраняя себя передачею письма из рук в руки, и именно молча, я уж тем самым тотчас бы выиграл, поставив себя в высшее над Версиловым положение, ибо, отказавшись, насколько это касается меня, от всех выгод по наследству (потому что мне, как сыну Версилова, уж конечно, что-нибудь перепало бы из этих денег, не сейчас, так потом), я сохранил бы за собою навеки высший нравственный взгляд на будущий поступок Версилова. Упрекнуть же меня за то, что я погубил князей, опять-таки никто бы не мог, потому что документ не имел решающего юридического значения. Все это я обдумал и совершенно уяснил себе, сидя в пустой комнате Васина, и мне даже вдруг пришло в голову, что пришел я к Васину, столь жаждая от него совета, как поступить, – единственно с тою целью, чтобы он увидал при этом, какой я сам благороднейший и бескорыстнейший человек, а стало быть, чтоб и отмстить ему тем самым за вчерашнее мое перед ним принижение.","I reasoned as follows: dealing with a letter of inheritance is a matter of conscience, and by choosing Vasin as a judge, I thereby show him the full depth of my respect, which, of course, should have flattered him. Of course, I was really concerned about this letter and really convinced of the need for an arbitration award; but I suspect, however, that even then I could wriggle out of the difficulty without any outside help. And most importantly, he himself knew about it; namely: one had only to give the letter to Versilov himself from hand to hand, and let him do what he wanted there: that was the solution. To put himself as the supreme judge and decider in a case of this kind was even completely wrong. Eliminating myself by passing the letter from hand to hand, and precisely silently, I would have thereby immediately gained by placing myself in a position higher than Versilov, for, having renounced, as far as it concerns me, all benefits by inheritance (because I, as a son Versilov, of course, something would have come from this money, if not now, then later), I would have retained forever the highest moral outlook on Versilov's future act. Again, no one could reproach me for having ruined the princes, because the document had no decisive legal significance. I thought all this over and completely clarified it to myself, sitting in Vassin's empty room, and it even suddenly occurred to me that I had come to Vassin, so eager for advice from him on what to do - with the sole purpose that he would see in this, what a most noble and disinterested person I am, and therefore, in order to avenge myself on him for my humiliation before him yesterday.","My reasoning went like this: the letter about the inheritance that I had in my possession was a matter of conscience; by entrusting to Vasin's judgment the decision as to what I should do about it , I was showing him how deeply I respected him, which was bound to flatter him. It was true, of course, that I had been worrying about that letter and had felt the need for an impartial opinion, but I admit that I already felt I could cope with the dilemma without any outside help. The best solution, I thought, was simply to give Versilov the letter and let him decide for himself. It was definitely improper for me to set myself up as a judge in this business. By handing the letter over to Versilov without comment, I would remove myself from the position of judge and thereby place myself in a position of superiority over Versilov, since I'd be renouncing any possible benefits myself, being, after all, Versilov's son and thus likely to inherit some of that money one day. That way I felt I would always be able to look upon whatever Versilov decided to do with lofty detachment. On the other hand, no one would be able to accuse me of having been the cause of the Sokolskys' ruin since the letter had no decisive legal force. I thought all that out while waiting for Vasin in his room. Indeed, what I had to do seemed clear to me now and I realized I'd really come to Vasin's not for advice but to show him what a noble and disinterested man I was and thus get even with him for my previous day's humiliation.","I reasoned that the matter of the letter was a question of conscience, and in choosing Vassin to decide it I was showing him the deepest respect, which no doubt must be flattering to him. Of course, I was really worried by this letter and was genuinely persuaded of the necessity of an outside opinion; but I suspect that I could have got out of my difficulty without any outside help. And what is more I was aware of that myself; I had only to give the letter to Versilov, to put it into his hands and then let him do what he liked with it—that would have settled it. To set myself up as judge, as arbitrator in a matter of this sort was indeed utterly irregular. By confining myself to handing over the letter, especially in silence, I should have scored at once, putting myself into a position of superiority over Versilov. For renouncing all the advantages of the inheritance as far as I was concerned (for some part of it would have been sure, sooner or later, to have fallen to me as Versilov's son), I should have secured for ever a superior moral attitude in regard to Versilov's future action. Nobody, on the other hand, could reproach me for ruining the Sokolskys, since the document had no decisive legal value. All this I thought over and made perfectly clear to myself, sitting in Vassin's empty room, and it even occurred to me suddenly that I had come to Vassin's, so thirsting for his advice how to act, simply to show him what a generous and irreproachable person I was, and so to avenge myself for my humiliation before him the previous evening."

"Он ласково смотрел мне в глаза, и мне видимо было, что он меня чуть не лучше всех любит, но я мигом и невольно заметил, что лицо его хоть и было веселое, но что болезнь сделала-таки в ночь успехи. Доктор перед тем только что весьма серьезно осмотрел его. Я узнал потом, что этот доктор (вот тот самый молодой человек, с которым я поссорился и который с самого прибытия Макара Ивановича лечил его) весьма внимательно относился к пациенту и – не умею я только говорить их медицинским языком – предполагал в нем целое осложнение разных болезней. Макар Иванович, как я с первого взгляда заметил, состоял уже с ним в теснейших приятельских отношениях; мне это в тот же миг не понравилось; а впрочем, и я, конечно, был очень скверен в ту минуту.","He looked kindly into my eyes, and it was evident to me that he loved me almost the best of all, but I instantly and involuntarily noticed that his face, although it was cheerful, but that the illness did make progress that night. The doctor had just examined him very seriously. I later found out that this doctor (this is the same young man with whom I had quarreled and who had been treating him from the very arrival of Makar Ivanovich) was very attentive to the patient and - I just can’t speak their medical language - assumed in him a whole complication of various diseases. Makar Ivanovich, as I noticed at first glance, was already on the closest friendly terms with him; I did not like it at the same moment; however, I, of course, was very nasty at that moment.","He looked warmly into my eyes and I thought that perhaps he liked me best of anyone there. But then I noticed that, although his face was cheerful, his state had obviously deteriorated during the night. Just before I'd come in, the doctor had given him a pretty thorough examination. Later I learned that the doctor, (the same young doctor with whom I'd quarreled), who had been attending Makar very devotedly ever since his arrival, had now diagnosed all sorts of complications resulting from his original complaints, but I won't try to repeat it all in medical jargon. By the way, I was struck at once by the friendly familiarity with which Makar and the doctor talked to each other, and it didn't please me at all. But then, in the mood I was in, nothing would have pleased me.","He looked into my face caressingly, and I saw that perhaps he liked me best of them all, but I could not help seeing instantly that, though his face was cheerful, his illness had made progress in the night. The doctor had only just been examining him very seriously. I learned afterwards that the doctor (the same young man with whom I had quarrelled had been treating Makar Ivanovitch ever since he arrived) had been very attentive to the patient and had diagnosed a complication of various diseases in him—but I don't know their medical terms. Makar Ivanovitch, as I observed from the first glance, was on the warmest, friendliest terms with him; I disliked that at that instant; but I was of course in a very bad mood at the moment."

"Пока я говорил, запыхавшись и торопясь, он взял письмо в руки и, держа его в левой руке на отлете, внимательно следил за мной. Когда я объявил о самоубийстве Крафта, я с особым вниманием всмотрелся в его лицо, чтоб увидеть эффект. И что же? – известие не произвело ни малейшего впечатления: даже хоть бы брови поднял! Напротив, видя, что я остановился, вытащил свой лорнет, никогда не оставлявший его и висевший на черной ленте, поднес письмо к свечке и, взглянув на подпись, пристально стал разбирать его. Не могу выразить, как я был даже обижен этим высокомерным бесчувствием. Он очень хорошо должен был знать Крафта; к тому же все-таки такое необыкновенное известие! Наконец, мне, натурально, хотелось, чтоб оно производило эффект. Подождав с полминуты и зная, что письмо длинно, я повернулся и вышел.

On the contrary, seeing that I had stopped, he pulled out his lorgnette, which never left it and hung on a black ribbon, raised the letter to the candle, and, looking at the signature, began to examine it intently. I cannot express how offended I was by this arrogant lack of feeling. He must have known Kraft very well; besides, all the same, such unusual news! Finally, I naturally wanted it to have an effect. After waiting for half a minute and knowing that the letter was long, I turned and left. My suitcase had been ready for a long time, only a few things remained to be hidden in a bundle.

When I stopped talking, he took his lorgnette which was tied to a black ribbon that he always had on him, went over to the candle, and, after glancing at the signature, started to decipher the letter itself. I cannot even convey how offended I was by this disdainful indifference. He must have known Kraft quite well and, besides, a suicide is unusual enough! Also, of course, I'd been eager for the news to produce an effect on him. I waited for perhaps half a minute but, knowing that it would take him much longer than that to read the letter to the end, I walked out of the living room and went up to my garret. My suitcase was packed, and all I had to do was make a bundle of the few remaining things that didn't fit in. I was thinking of Mother and how I hadn't spoken to her just now. I was ready to leave within ten minutes but, just as I was about to go out and find a cab, my sister came in.","While I was speaking with breathless haste he took the letter and, holding it lightly poised in his left hand, watched me attentively.

If he had even raised an eyebrow! On the contrary, seeing that I had paused, he drew out his eyeglasses, which he always had about him hanging on a black ribbon, carried the letter to the candle and, glancing at the signature, began carefully examining it. I can't express how mortified I was at this supercilious callousness. He must have known Kraft very well: it was, in any case, such an extraordinary piece of news! Besides, I naturally desired it to produce an effect. Knowing that the letter was long, I turned, after waiting, and went out. My trunk had been packed long ago, I had only to stuff a few things into my bag. I thought of my mother and that I had not gone up to speak to her. Ten minutes later, when I had finished my preparations and was meaning to go for a cab, my sister walked into my attic."

Именно не давить надо было Лизу укором, а встретить радостью и поздравлением новое прекрасное чувство, которое несомненно должно было в ней зародиться. Но, вместо всех этих чувств, я вдруг встал и начал, твердо отчеканивая слова:","And she kissed her, I don't know why, but that was the way it had to be done; so that I almost rushed to kiss Tatyana Pavlovna myself. Precisely, it was necessary not to press Liza with reproach, but to meet with joy and congratulations a new wonderful feeling, which undoubtedly should have arisen in her. But, instead of all these feelings, I suddenly got up and began, firmly rapping out the words:","And she herself kissed Lisa. I don't really know why she felt she had to kiss Lisa, but I was sure it was the right thing to do. In fact, I almost rushed toward Mrs. Prutkov myself to kiss her. Her instinct had told her that it would have been completely wrong to crush Lisa further with reproaches at that moment and it was much better to acknowledge the stirrings of a new feeling that must have been born in the poor girl. But instead of saying what I thought, I got up and, articulating my words with utmost deliberation, declared:","And she kissed the girl, I don't know why, but it seemed exactly the right thing to do; so that I almost rushed to kiss Tatyana Pavlovna myself. What was fitting was not to overwhelm Liza with reproach, but to welcome with joy and congratulation the new feeling that must certainly have sprung up in her.

"Я ей болтал в этом роде все время, пока мы взбирались к нам. Читатель, вероятно, замечает, что я себя не очень щажу и отлично, где надо, аттестую: я хочу выучиться говорить правду. Версилов был дома. Я вошел не сбросив пальто, она тоже. Одета она была ужасно жидко: на темном платьишке болтался сверху лоскуточек чего-то, долженствовавший изображать плащ или мантилью; на голове у ней была старая, облупленная шляпка-матроска, очень ее не красившая. Когда мы вошли в залу, мать сидела на своем обычном месте за работой, а сестра вышла поглядеть из своей комнаты и остановилась в дверях. Версилов, по обыкновению, ничего не делал и поднялся нам навстречу; он уставился на меня строгим, вопросительным взглядом.","I was talking to her like that the whole time we were climbing up to us. The reader will probably notice that I do not spare myself very much and I certify perfectly where necessary: I want to learn to tell the truth. Versilov was at home. I entered without taking off my coat, and so did she. She was dressed terribly fluidly: a piece of something dangled on top of a dark dress, supposed to represent a cloak or mantilla; on her head was an old, peeling sailor hat, which did not look very pretty. When we entered the hall, the mother was sitting in her usual place at work, and the sister came out of her room to look and stood in the doorway. Versilov, as usual, did nothing and got up to meet us; he stared at me with a stern, questioning look.","I kept blabbering on like that until we reached the cottage. The reader will, of course, notice that I'm not sparing myself anything, although I do give myself credit when it is due. I want to train myself to stick to the truth. Versilov was at home. Once inside, I didn't even bother to take off my overcoat. She too kept her coat on, a rather shabby one, on top of which she had tied an odd piece of material as a scarf, and on her head was something that looked like a rain hat, old and battered, which certainly didn't help her looks any. In the living room, my mother was sitting in her usual place and sewing. My sister had come out of her room to see who had arrived and was now standing in the doorway. Versilov, who had been doing nothing as usual, got up from his chair and looked at me questioningly and reprovingly.","I babbled on like this while we were making our way to the lodge. The reader will, no doubt, observe that I don't spare myself much, though I give myself a good character on occasion; I want to train myself to tell the truth. Versilov was at home. I went in without taking off my overcoat; she did the same. Her clothes were dreadfully thin: over a wretched gown of some dark colour was hung a rag that did duty for a cloak or mantle; on her head she wore an old and frayed sailor-hat, which was very unbecoming. When we went into the room my mother was sitting at her usual place at work, and my sister came out of her room to see who it was, and was standing in the doorway. Versilov, as usual, was doing nothing, and he got up to meet us. He looked at me intently with a stern and inquiring gaze."

Я, может быть, лично и других идей, и захочу служить человечеству, и буду, и, может быть, в десять раз больше буду, чем все проповедники; но только я хочу, чтобы с меня этого никто не смел требовать, заставлять меня, как господина Крафта; моя полная свобода, если я даже и пальца не подыму.

"Действительно, было некоторое сходство с внутренностью гроба, и я даже подивился, как он верно с одного слова определил. Каморка была узкая и длинная; с высоты плеча моего, не более, начинался угол стены и крыши, конец которой я мог достать ладонью. Версилов, в первую минуту, бессознательно держал себя сгорбившись, боясь задеть головой о потолок, однако не задел и кончил тем, что довольно спокойно уселся на моем диване, на котором была уже постлана моя постель. Что до меня, я не садился и смотрел на него в глубочайшем удивлении.","Indeed, there was some resemblance to the inside of the coffin, and I even marveled at how he correctly identified it from one word. The closet was narrow and long; from the height of my shoulder, no more, began the corner of the wall and the roof, the end of which I could reach with my palm. Versilov, for the first minute, unconsciously kept himself hunched over, afraid to hit his head on the ceiling, but he did not, and ended up sitting rather calmly on my sofa, on which my bed had already been made. As for me, I did not sit down and looked at him in the deepest astonishment.","And, indeed, there was a certain resemblance to the inside of a coffin; I was quite impressed by the aptness of his comparison. It was a narrow box of a room and the ceiling sloped up from about the height of my shoulder on one side to the opposite end where I could still put the palm of my hand flat on the ceiling. At first Versilov instinctively held his head between his shoulders so as not to hit the ceiling, but he soon realized that there was headroom where he stood; he relaxed and sat down on the sofa, now looking quite at ease; it didn't seem to bother him at all that my bed had already been made up. I remained standing and was staring at him in deep wonderment.","It really had a resemblance to the inside of a coffin, and I positively admired the way he had described it in one word. It was a long narrow box of a room, the ceiling sloped away from the wall at the height of my shoulder, and the top of it was within easy reach of my hand. Versilov unconsciously stood stooping, afraid of hitting his head against the ceiling; he did not knock it, however, and, finally more or less reassured, he seated himself on the sofa, where my bed had already been made up. But I did not sit down, I looked at him in the greatest amazement."

"Я уступчив и мелочен только в мелочах, но в главном не уступлю никогда. В мелочах же, в каких-нибудь светских приемах, со мной Бог знает что можно сделать, и я всегда проклинаю в себе эту черту. Из какого-то смердящего добродушия я иногда бывал готов поддакивать даже какому-нибудь светскому фату, единственно обольщенный его вежливостью, или ввязывался в спор с дураком, что всего непростительнее. Все это от невыдержки и оттого, что вырос в углу. Уходишь злой и клянешься, что завтра это уже не повторится, но завтра опять то же самое. Вот почему меня принимали иногда чуть не за шестнадцатилетнего. Но вместо приобретения выдержки я и теперь предпочитаю закупориться еще больше в угол, хотя бы в самом мизантропическом виде: «Пусть я неловок, но – прощайте!» Я это говорю серьезно и навсегда. Впрочем, вовсе не по поводу князя это пишу, и даже не по поводу тогдашнего разговора.","I am compliant and petty only in small things, but in the main I will never yield. In small things, in some secular receptions, God knows what can be done with me, and I always curse this trait in myself. Out of some kind of stinking good nature, I was sometimes ready to assent even to some secular veil, only seduced by his politeness, or got involved in an argument with a fool, which is most unforgivable. All this from lack of endurance and because he grew up in a corner. You leave angry and swear that tomorrow it will not happen again, but tomorrow it will be the same again. That is why I was sometimes mistaken for being almost sixteen years old. But instead of acquiring restraint, even now I prefer to clog even more into a corner, at least in the most misanthropic form: “Let me be awkward, but - goodbye!” I say this seriously and forever. However, I am not writing this at all about the prince, and not even about the conversation at that time.","I'm accommodating enough to yield on unimportant things, but I'll never give way on a point that matters. When it comes to trifles, such as social conventions and the like, I'm willing to go out of my way God knows how far, but I always loathe myself for being like that. It is because of this sickening wishy-washiness of mine that I can kowtow to any smug well-dressed gentleman, if only he deigns to address me politely. Otherwise, I am liable to get into a violent argument with some moron, which is even worse. All that, I suppose, comes from lack of self-control, because I've grown up in seclusion, hiding in my corner. After letting myself go like that, I always leave furious and promise myself that I'll never be caught at it again, but the next day I get caught once more. This even causes people sometimes to take me for . . . for a sixteen-year-old! But instead of acquiring self-control, even now I'd rather withdraw even deeper into my corner, however misanthropic that may seem to others, and snarl: "" All right, I know I'm awkward, but I don't care, good-bye! "" I mean it and I say it once and for all. But what I've written just now has nothing to do with the old prince or with our conversation that day.","I am ready to give way and be trivial only about trifles. I never give way in things that are really important. In trifles, in little matters of etiquette, you can do anything you like with me, and I curse this peculiarity in myself. From a sort of putrid good nature I've sometimes been ready to knuckle under to some fashionable snob, simply flattered by his affability, or I've let myself be drawn into argument with a fool, which is more unpardonable than anything. All this is due to lack of self- control, and to my having grown up in seclusion, but next day it would be the same thing again: that's why I was sometimes taken for a boy of sixteen. But instead of gaining self-control I prefer even now to bottle myself up more tightly than ever in my shell— ""I may be clumsy—but good-bye!""—however misanthropic that may seem. I say that seriously and for good. But I don't write this with reference to the prince or even with reference to that conversation."
"– Выйдите из узкости вашей идеи, – не слушал ничего Тихомиров. – Если Россия только материал для более благородных племен, то почему же ей и не послужить таким материалом? Это – роль довольно еще благовидная. Почему не успокоиться на этой идее ввиду расширения задачи? Человечество накануне своего перерождения, которое уже началось. Предстоящую задачу отрицают только слепые. Оставьте Россию, если вы в ней разуверились, и работайте для будущего, – для будущего еще неизвестного народа, но который составится из всего человечества, без разбора племен. И без того Россия умерла бы когда-нибудь; народы, даже самые даровитые, живут всего по полторы, много по две тысячи лет; не все ли тут равно: две тысячи или двести лет? Римляне не прожили и полутора тысяч лет в живом виде и обратились тоже в материал. Их давно нет, но они оставили идею, и она вошла элементом дальнейшего в судьбы человечества. Как же можно сказать человеку, что нечего делать? Я представить не могу положения, чтоб когда-нибудь было нечего делать! Делайте для человечества и об остальном не заботьтесь. Дела так много, что недостанет жизни, если внимательно оглянуться.","“Get out of the narrowness of your idea,” Tikhomirov did not listen to anything. - If Russia is only material for more noble tribes, then why shouldn't it serve as such material? This is a rather plausible role. Why not rest on this idea in view of the expansion of the task? Humanity is on the eve of its rebirth, which has already begun. The task ahead is denied only by the blind. Leave Russia if you have lost faith in it, and work for the future, for the future of a still unknown people, but which will be made up of all mankind, without discrimination of tribes. And without that, Russia would have died someday; peoples, even the most gifted, live only one and a half, many two thousand years; is it not all the same here: two thousand or two hundred years? The Romans did not live even one and a half thousand years in a living form and also turned into material. They have been gone for a long time, but they left the idea, and it became an element of the future in the fate of mankind. How can you tell a person that there is nothing to do? I can't imagine the situation, so that someday there was nothing to do! Do for humanity and don't worry about the rest. There is so much to do that there is not enough life, if you look closely.","""Let's try to get beyond your narrow premise,"" shouted Tikhomirov, who was ignoring what the others said. ""If Russia is really the material for nobler nations, what's wrong with being such material? It's still a pretty respectable role. Why shouldn't we broaden the whole problem and content ourselves with that role? Mankind is today on the eve of its regeneration, which, in fact, has already started. The problem facing us now can only be missed by those who are blind. So, if you are disappointed in Russia, forget it and work for the future, still unknown nation that will be built out of all mankind without regard for race. Even without that, Russia was bound to die one day. Even the most gifted nations survive for, say, fifteen hundred years, at best two thousand. The Romans didn't last for even fifteen hundred years and were turned into raw material. Rome hasn't existed for a long time now, but she left behind an idea that became a component part of mankind's future growth. So how can anyone tell a man that there's no point in him doing anything? I can't even visualize a situation where people will have nothing to do! Just work for mankind and stop worrying about the rest. If you look hard enough for what to do, your life won't last long enough for you to do it!""","""Take a wider view of your idea,"" cried Tihomirov, heeding nothing. ""If Russia is only the material for nobler races why shouldn't she serve as such material? It's a sufficiently attractive part for her to play. Why not accept the idea calmly, considering how it enlarges the task? Humanity is on the eve of its regeneration, which is already beginning. None but the blind deny the task before us. Let Russia alone, if you've lost faith in her, and work for the future, for the future unknown people that will be formed of all humanity without distinction of race. Russia would perish some time, anyway; even the most gifted peoples exist for fifteen hundred or at the most two thousand years. Isn't it all the same whether it's two thousand or two hundred? The Romans did not last fifteen hundred years as a vital force, they too have turned into material. They ceased to exist long ago, but they've left an idea, and it has become an element in the future of mankind. How can one tell a man there's nothing to be done? I can't conceive of a position in which there ever could be nothing to do! Work for humanity and don't trouble about the rest. There's so much to do that life isn't long enough if you look into it more closely."""

I only wanted to drop a hint and see from his face, from his eyes, whether he knew anything about ""shares.

I did not answer his question "" what shares,"" I was silent; and it was worth noting that he did not pursue the subject either."

"Квартира эта состояла из трех комнат. Та, в которой все, по обыкновению, сидели, серединная комната, или гостиная, была у нас довольно большая и почти приличная. В ней все же были мягкие красные диваны, очень, впрочем, истертые (Версилов не терпел чехлов), кой-какие ковры, несколько столов и ненужных столиков. Затем, направо, находилась комната Версилова, тесная и узкая, в одно окно; в ней стоял жалкий письменный стол, на котором валялось несколько неупотребляемых книг и забытых бумаг, а перед столом не менее жалкое мягкое кресло, со сломанной и поднявшейся вверх углом пружиной, от которой часто стонал Версилов и бранился. В этом же кабинете, на мягком и тоже истасканном диване, стлали ему и спать; он ненавидел этот свой кабинет и, кажется, ничего в нем не делал, а предпочитал сидеть праздно в гостиной по целым часам. Налево из гостиной была точно такая же комнатка, в ней спали мать и сестра. В гостиную входили из коридора, который оканчивался входом в кухню, где жила кухарка Лукерья, и когда стряпала, то чадила пригорелым маслом на всю квартиру немилосердно. Бывали минуты, когда Версилов громко проклинал свою жизнь и участь из-за этого кухонного чада, и в этом одном я ему вполне сочувствовал; я тоже ненавижу эти запахи, хотя они и не проникали ко мне: я жил вверху в светелке, под крышей, куда подымался по чрезвычайно крутой и скрипучей лесенке. Там у меня было достопримечательного – полукруглое окно, ужасно низкий потолок, клеенчатый диван, на котором Лукерья к ночи постилала мне простыню и клала подушку, а прочей мебели лишь два предмета – простейший тесовый стол и дырявый плетеный стул.","This apartment consisted of three rooms. The one in which everyone, as usual, sat, the middle room, or drawing room, was quite large and almost decent. It still contained soft red sofas, very worn, however (Versilov did not tolerate slipcovers), some carpets, several tables and unnecessary tables. Then, to the right, was Versilov's room, cramped and narrow, with one window; there was a miserable writing-table on which lay several unused books and forgotten papers, and in front of the table was a no less miserable easy chair, with a spring broken and raised up at the corner, from which Versilov often groaned and scolded. In the same study, on a soft and also worn sofa, they made him sleep; he hated this office of his and, it seems, did nothing in it, but preferred to sit idly in the drawing-room for whole hours. To the left of the living room was exactly the same room, in which mother and sister slept. The living room was entered from a corridor that ended in the entrance to the kitchen, where the cook Lukerya lived, and when she cooked, she mercilessly smoked the whole apartment with burnt oil. There were moments when Versilov loudly cursed his life and fate because of this kitchen fumes, and in this one thing I fully sympathized with him; I also hate these smells, although they did not penetrate me: I lived upstairs in a room, under a roof, where I climbed an extremely steep and creaky ladder. I had something remarkable there - a semicircular window, a terribly low ceiling, an oilcloth sofa, on which Lukerya spread a sheet for me at night and laid a pillow, and there were only two other pieces of furniture - a simple wooden table and a holey wicker chair.","Our cottage consisted of three rooms: the living room, where we usually gathered, was quite spacious and almost presentable, with its soft red sofas and armchairs, comfortable although well worn (Versilov couldn't stand slipcovers on furniture), with a few decent rugs, and a set of tables of various sizes, some of which were quite useless. The door on the right as one entered led to Versilov's narrow room, which had one window. It had a ramshackle desk strewn with dusty books and abandoned papers. Next to this desk was an equally wretched-looking armchair, with a spring sticking up in one corner that got in Versilov's way when he sat down and made him swear. It was on the old, threadbare sofa in this room that Versilov's bed was made up at night. Versilov hated this room that he referred to as his ""study,"" and I don't think he ever did any work in there, for he mostly sat idly in the living room for hours on end. The door on the left led to another room of exactly the same size that was shared by my mother and sister. From the living room, a passage led to the kitchen where old Lukeria lived and cooked, and one could tell when she was cooking because the whole place reeked of burned fat. That stench sometimes made Versilov swear aloud and curse his existence, and on that point I fully sympathized with him because I too hate bad smells, even though they couldn't get all the way to my attic under the eaves, which I reached by very steep and shaky steps. The only things worth mentioning about that garret were a semicircular window, a very low slanting ceiling, and an oilcloth-covered sofa, on which at night Lukeria spread sheets and put a pillow for me to sleep. The rest of my furnishings consisted of two items: a plain wooden table and a ramshackle wicker chair.","The flat consisted of three rooms. The room in which we usually sat, the middle room or drawing-room, was fairly large and almost presentable. In it were soft, red armchairs and a sofa, very much the worse for wear, however (Versilov could not endure covers on furniture); there were rugs of a sort and several tables, including some useless little ones. On the right was Versilov's room, cramped and narrow with one window; it was furnished with a wretched-looking writing-table covered with unused books and crumpled papers, and an equally wretched-looking easy chair with a broken spring that stuck up in one corner and often made Versilov groan and swear. On an equally threadbare sofa in this room he used to sleep. He hated this study of his, and I believe he never did anything in it; he preferred sitting idle for hours together in the drawing-room. On the left of the drawing-room there was another room of the same sort in which my mother and sister slept. The drawing-room was entered from the passage at the end of which was the kitchen, where the cook, Lukerya, lived, and when she cooked, she ruthlessly filled the whole flat with the smell of burnt fat. There were moments when Versilov cursed his life and fate aloud on account of the smell from the kitchen, and in that one matter I sympathized with him fully; I hated that smell, too, though it did not penetrate to my room: I lived upstairs in an attic under the roof, to which I climbed by a very steep and shaky ladder. The only things worth mentioning in it were a semicircular window, a low-pitched ceiling, a sofa covered with American leather on which at night Lukerya spread sheets and put a pillow for me. The rest of the furniture consisted of two articles, a perfectly plain deal table and a wooden rush-bottomed chair."
"– Без сомнения, – прервал я горячо. – Некто Васин говорит, что в поступке его с этим письмом и с отказом от наследства заключается «пьедестал»… По-моему, такие вещи не делаются для показу, а соответствуют чему-то основному, внутреннему.","""No doubt,"" I interrupted hotly. - Someone Vasin says that in his act with this letter and with the refusal of the inheritance lies a ""pedestal"" ...

""You know, there's a man called Vasin who claims that, by renouncing his right to the inheritance, Versilov was trying, as Vasin puts it, to 'erect a pedestal to himself.'

"Конечно, у меня вдруг являлся отец, которого никогда прежде не было. Эта мысль пьянила меня и при сборах в Москве, и в вагоне. Что отец – это бы еще ничего, и нежностей я не любил, но человек этот меня знать не хотел и унизил, тогда как я мечтал о нем все эти годы взасос (если можно так о мечте выразиться). Каждая мечта моя, с самого детства, отзывалась им: витала около него, сводилась на него в окончательном результате. Я не знаю, ненавидел или любил я его, но он наполнял собою все мое будущее, все расчеты мои на жизнь, – и это случилось само собою, это шло вместе с ростом.","Of course, I suddenly had a father who had never been before. This thought intoxicated me both at the training camp in Moscow and in the carriage. That a father would be nothing, and I didn’t like tenderness, but this man didn’t want to know me and humiliated me, while I dreamed about him all these years passionately (if I can put it that way about a dream). Every dream of mine, from my very childhood, resonated with them: hovering around him, converging on him in the final result. I don't know whether I hated or loved him, but he filled my whole future with himself, all my plans for life - and this happened by itself, it went along with growth.","It is true I suddenly had a father, a feeling I had never experienced before. I felt quite elated by that thought while preparing for my journey and in the train that carried me from Moscow to Petersburg. It was not just that he was my father—I didn't go in much for that kind of sentimental stuff anyway—but he was the man who had humiliated me and had refused to have anything to do with me during all those years when I had been breathlessly feeding on daydreams about him, if it is possible to apply such words to daydreams. From my childhood on, every daydream I had was lighted by his presence, was spun around him, and finally converged on his person. I don't know whether I loved him or hated him, but in my thoughts his shadow dominated my future life and all the plans I had for it. And this happened by itself; it grew as I grew.","To be sure, a father, something I had never had before, had appeared upon the scene. This thought intoxicated me as I made my preparations in Moscow and sat in the railway carriage. That he was my father would be nothing. I was not fond of sentimentality, but this man had humiliated me and had not cared to know me, while all those years I had been chewing away at my dreams of him, if one may use such an expression. From my childhood upward, my dreams were all coloured by him; all hovered about him as the final goal. I don't know whether I hated him or loved him; but his figure dominated the future and all my schemes of life. And this happened of itself. It grew up with me."

"– Довольно, я с вами совершенно согласен и настолько верю в ваш ум, что вполне надеюсь, вы перестанете слишком уж долго распекать меня. Вы так любите меру; а между тем есть мера всему, даже и внезапной любви вашей к моей матери. Лучше вот что: если вы решились ко мне зайти и у меня просидеть четверть часа или полчаса (я все еще не знаю для чего, ну, положим, для спокойствия матери) – и, сверх того, с такой охотой со мной говорите, несмотря на то что произошло внизу, то расскажите уж мне лучше про моего отца – вот про этого Макара Иванова, странника. Я именно от вас бы хотел услыхать о нем; я спросить вас давно намеревался. Расставаясь, и, может быть, надолго, я бы очень хотел от вас же получить ответ и еще на вопрос: неужели в целые эти двадцать лет вы не могли подействовать на предрассудки моей матери, а теперь так даже и сестры, настолько, чтоб рассеять своим цивилизующим влиянием первоначальный мрак окружавшей ее среды? О, я не про чистоту ее говорю! Она и без того всегда была бесконечно выше вас нравственно, извините, но… это лишь бесконечно высший мертвец. Живет лишь один Версилов, а все остальное кругом него и все с ним связанное прозябает под тем непременным условием, чтоб иметь честь питать его своими силами, своими живыми соками. Но ведь была же и она когда-то живая? Ведь вы что-нибудь полюбили же в ней? Ведь была же и она когда-то женщиной?","“That’s enough, I completely agree with you and have such confidence in your mind that I quite hope you will stop scolding me for too long. You love measure so much; and meanwhile there is a measure for everything, even your sudden love for my mother. This is better: if you decide to come to me and sit with me for a quarter of an hour or half an hour (I still don’t know why, well, let’s say, for my mother’s peace of mind) - and, moreover, talk to me with such a willingness, despite what happened below, then tell me better about my father - that's about this Makar Ivanov, a wanderer. It is from you that I would like to hear about it; I have been meaning to ask you for a long time. Parting, and perhaps for a long time, I would very much like to receive an answer from you and another question: could it be that in these whole twenty years you could not have influenced the prejudices of my mother, and now even my sister, so much as to dispel her civilizing influence the original darkness of its environment? Oh, I'm not talking about her purity! She has always been infinitely higher morally than you, excuse me, but ... this is only an infinitely higher dead man. Only Versilov lives, and everything else around him and everything connected with him vegetates under that indispensable condition to have the honor of nourishing him with his own strength, with his living juices. But was she ever alive? Is there anything you love about her? Was she once a woman?","""That's enough now, you have thoroughly convinced me and I have such a high regard for your intelligence that I hope you won't keep slicing me open with it for too long. You who are so concerned with a sense of proportion, let me point out to you that your sudden love for my mother strikes me as rather out of proportion. Now I'll tell you what you'd better do: since you've decided to spend a quarter or half an hour with me—I still don't know why you came, but let's assume it was for the sake of Mother's peace of mind—and since you seem to enjoy conversing with me despite what happened downstairs, I'd rather you talked to me about my father, Makar Dolgo-ruky, the pilgrim. I've wanted to ask you about him for a long time, as I'm particularly interested in what you think of him. Also, before we part, I would like very much to hear your answer to this question: how is it that, in the twenty years you have spent with my mother, your civilizing influence has not succeeded in dispelling the dark superstitious beliefs she brought with her from her primitive environment? Yes, and my sister is not free of them either. Oh, I'm not talking about my mother's respectability, for she's always been infinitely higher than you in the moral sense, but she is—if you don't mind my saying so—only a morally superior corpse because Versilov alone is alive and all the people around him are there only for the privilege of having him feed on their life juices. But she too must have been alive once, mustn't she? Surely she must've had something in her that attracted you? She must have been a woman once?""","""Enough, I entirely agree with you, and I have enough faith in your intelligence to hope that you won't go on rating at me too long for it. You are so fond of moderation; and yet there's a moderation in all things, even in your sudden love for my mother. I'll tell you what would be better: since you have gone so far as to come up and see me and mean to spend a quarter of an hour or half an hour with me (I still don't know what for, we'll assume for my mother's peace of mind), and what's more, in spite of the scene downstairs, seem so eager to talk to me, you had better tell me about my father— tell me about Makar Ivanovitch the pilgrim. I want to hear from you about him: I have been intending to ask you for some time past. Now that we are parting perhaps for a long time, I should very much like to get from you an answer to another question: has it really been impossible for you during these twenty years to affect my mother's traditional ideas—and now my sister's, too—so as to dissipate by your civilizing influence the primitive darkness of her environment? Oh, I am not speaking of the purity of her nature. She's infinitely nobler than you, morally anyway, excuse my saying so … but she's only an infinitely noble corpse. Versilov is the only one living, everything else about him and everything connected with him exists only on the express condition of having the honour to nourish him with its force, its living sap. But I suppose she, too, was once alive, wasn't she? I suppose you loved something in her, didn't you? I suppose she was once a woman?"""

Even if you had honourable intentions I don't want your charity. Not a word, not a word! Oh, how glad I am that I have unmasked you now before your women! Curse you!"""

"– Ну что он знает, твой Александр Семеныч, – улыбнулся Макар Иванович, – милый он человек, а и не более. Полноте, други, али думаете, что я помирать боюсь? Было у меня сегодня, после утренней молитвы, такое в сердце чувство, что уж более отсюда не выйду; сказано было. Ну и что же, да будет благословенно имя Господне; только на вас еще на всех наглядеться хочется. И Иов многострадальный, глядя на новых своих детушек, утешался, а забыл ли прежних, и мог ли забыть их – невозможно сие! Только с годами печаль как бы с радостью вместе смешивается, в воздыхание светлое преобразуется. Так-то в мире: всякая душа и испытуема и утешена. Положил я, детки, вам словечко сказать одно, небольшое, – продолжал он с тихой, прекрасной улыбкой, которую я никогда не забуду, и обратился вдруг ко мне: – Ты, милый, церкви святой ревнуй, и аще позовет время – и умри за нее; да подожди, не пугайся, не сейчас, – усмехнулся он. – Теперь ты, может быть, о сем и не думаешь, потом, может, подумаешь. Только вот что еще: что благое делать замыслишь, то делай для Бога, а не зависти ради. Дела же своего твердо держись и не сдавай через всякое малодушие; делай же постепенно, не бросаясь и не кидаясь; ну, вот и все, что тебе надо. Разве только молитву приучайся творить ежедневно и неуклонно. Я это так только, авось когда припомнишь. Хотел было я и вам, Андрей Петрович, сударь, кой-что сказать, да Бог и без меня ваше сердце найдет. Да и давно уж мы с вами о сем прекратили, с тек пор как сия стрела сердце мое пронзила. Ныне же, отходя, лишь напомню… о чем тогда пообещали…","- Well, what does he know, your Alexander Semenych, - smiled Makar Ivanovich, - he is a nice person, and nothing more. Come on, friends, do you think that I'm afraid to die? Today, after morning prayer, I had such a feeling in my heart that I would not leave here again; was said. So what, blessed be the name of the Lord; I just want to look at all of you. And Job, the long-suffering, looking at his new children, consoled himself, but did he forget the former ones, and could he forget them - this is impossible! Only over the years, sadness, as it were, mixes together with joy, transforms into a sigh of light. So it is in the world: every soul is tested and comforted. I put a word to you, children, to say one word, a small one, - he continued with a quiet, beautiful smile, which I will never forget, and suddenly turned to me: her; wait, don’t be scared, not now,” he chuckled. “Now you may not think about it, but later you may think about it. But here's another thing: whatever good you plan to do, do it for God, and not for the sake of envy. Hold fast to your deeds and do not give up through any cowardice; do it gradually, without rushing or rushing; well, that's all you need. Unless you learn to pray daily and steadily. I'm just like that, maybe when you remember. I wanted to say something to you too, Andrey Petrovich, sir, but God will find your heart even without me. Yes, and we stopped talking about this a long time ago, since this arrow pierced my heart. Now, departing, I will only remind you… what they promised then…","""Ah, what does he know, your doctor?"" Makar said, and smiled. "" He's a nice man, but that's all he is. Don't be like that, my friends, for you don't really think I'm afraid to die, do you? After I said my prayers this morning, I had a feeling that I'd never leave this room again, and I know I won't. So why not, and may the name of our Lord be blessed. My only wish is to have my fill of looking at you all. The long-suffering Job was comforted by looking on his new children. You don't believe that he could have forgotten his dead children, do you? No, he couldn't, for that's impossible! But, with time, grief diminishes as it gets mixed with joy and then you can breathe freely again. That's how it is in this world: every soul is tried and is consoled. I have decided to say a few words to you, my children,"" he said with a quiet and radiant smile that I will never forget and then, to my surprise, he addressed me personally: ""You, my boy, you must always stand up for our Holy Church and if you're called upon one day to do it, die for her. . . . No, no, don't get alarmed , that's not for a long time yet!"" he laughed silently. ""You may not be thinking much about these things yet, but later perhaps you will. . . . And I also wanted to say this to you too: if you decide to do a good thing, do it not out of envy but for God. And you must be firm and stick to what you've decided is right; don't give up out of weakness; be steady in your effort and don't throw yourself first this way and then that way. . . . Well, that's all I wanted to say to you, except perhaps that you should try to get into the habit of praying every day. . . . Well, just in case you should remember. . . ."" Then he turned to Versilov: ""I wanted to say a few things to you too, sir, but I'm sure God will find the way to your heart without my help. Anyway, it's a long time since we stopped talking about these things, the two of us, ever since that arrow pierced my heart. So now, as I'm leaving, I'd only like to remind you of your promise. . . .""","""Why, what does he know, your Alexandr Semyonovitch—he's a dear man and nothing more. Give over, friends, do you think that I'm afraid to die? After my morning prayer to-day I had the feeling in my heart that I should never go out again from here; it was told me. Well, what of it, blessed be the name of the Lord. Yet I have a longing to be looking upon all of you still. Job, after all his sufferings, was comforted looking upon his new children, and forgot the children that were gone—it is impossible! Only with the years the sorrow is mingled with the joy and turned to sighs of gladness. So it is in the world. Every soul is tried and is comforted. I thought, children, to say one little word to you,"" he went on with a gentle, exquisite smile which I shall never forget, and he turned to me, ""be zealous for the Holy Church, my dear, and if the time calls for it—die for her; but wait a bit, don't be frightened, it won't be at once,"" he added, laughing. "" Now perhaps you don't think of it, afterwards you will think of it. And something more. Any good thing you bethink yourself to do, do it for the sake of God and not for envy. Stand firmly to your cause, and do not give way through any sort of cowardice ; act steadily, neither rushing nor turning about; well, that is all I want to tell you. Only accustom yourself to pray daily and unceasingly. I say this now, maybe you'll remember it. I should like to say something to you, too, Andrey Petrovitch, sir, but God will find your heart without my words. And for long years we have ceased to speak of that, ever since that arrow pierced my heart. Now that I am departing I would only remind you of what you promised then… ."""
"Он только что умер, за минуту какую-нибудь до моего прихода. За десять минут он еще чувствовал себя как всегда. С ним была тогда одна Лиза; она сидела у него и рассказывала ему о своем горе, а он, как вчера, гладил ее по голове. Вдруг он весь затрепетал (рассказывала Лиза), хотел было привстать, хотел было вскрикнуть и молча стал падать на левую сторону. «Разрыв сердца!» – говорил Версилов. Лиза закричала на весь дом, и вот тут-то они все и сбежались – и все это за минуту какую-нибудь до моего прихода.","He had just died, a minute or so before I arrived. Ten minutes later, he still felt like he always did. Liza was alone with him then; she sat with him and told him about her grief, and he, like yesterday, stroked her head. Suddenly he began to tremble all over (Lisa told), he wanted to get up, he wanted to scream, and silently began to fall on his left side. ""Heartbreak!"" Versilov said. Lisa screamed at the whole house, and it was then that they all came running - and all this some minute before my arrival.","He had died just a minute or so before I'd come in, but only ten minutes before he'd been his usual self. Only Lisa had been in the room at the time. She had been sitting next to him, telling him about her troubles, and, as on the previous day, he had been listening to her, gently stroking her head. But suddenly, Lisa told us, he had begun to shiver, tried to get up, made an effort to say something, but instead had started slipping to the left in silence. (Versilov said that it was a heart attack.) Lisa had let out a scream that had resounded all over the house and everybody had come running. As I said, it had all happened perhaps one minute before I'd entered the house.","He had only just died, one minute before I arrived. Only ten minutes before he had felt just as usual.

"– У меня был в прежнем пансионишке, у Тушара, еще до гимназии, один товарищ, Ламберт. Он все меня бил, потому что был больше чем тремя годами старше, а я ему служил и сапоги снимал. Когда он ездил на конфирмацию, то к нему приехал аббат Риго поздравить с первым причастием, и оба кинулись в слезах друг другу на шею, и аббат Риго стал его ужасно прижимать к своей груди, с разными жестами. Я тоже плакал и очень завидовал. Когда у него умер отец, он вышел, и я два года его не видал, а через два года встретил на улице. Он сказал, что ко мне придет. Я уже был в гимназии и жил у Николая Семеновича. Он пришел поутру, показал мне пятьсот рублей и велел с собой ехать. Хоть он и бил меня два года назад, а всегда во мне нуждался, не для одних сапог; он все мне пересказывал. Он сказал, что деньги утащил сегодня у матери из шкатулки, подделав ключ, потому что деньги от отца все его, по закону, и что она не смеет не давать, а что вчера к нему приходил аббат Риго увещевать – вошел, стал над ним и стал хныкать, изображать ужас и поднимать руки к небу, «а я вынул нож и сказал, что я его зарежу» (он выговаривал: загхэжу). Мы поехали на Кузнецкий. Дорогой он мне сообщил, что его мать в сношениях с аббатом Риго, и что он это заметил, и что он на все плюет, и что все, что они говорят про причастие, – вздор. Он еще много говорил, а я боялся. На Кузнецком он купил двухствольное ружье, ягдташ, готовых патронов, манежный хлыст и потом еще фунт конфет. Мы поехали за город стрелять и дорогою встретили птицелова с клетками; Ламберт купил у него канарейку. В роще он канарейку выпустил, так как она не может далеко улететь после клетки, и стал стрелять в нее, но не попал. Он в первый раз стрелял в жизни, а ружье давно хотел купить, еще у Тушара, и мы давно уже о ружье мечтали. Он точно захлебывался. Волосы у него были черные ужасно, лицо белое и румяное, как на маске, нос длинный, с горбом, как у французов, зубы белые, глаза черные. Он привязал канарейку ниткой к сучку и из двух стволов, в упор, на вершок расстояния, дал по ней два залпа, и она разлетелась на сто перушков. Потом мы воротились, заехали в гостиницу, взяли номер, стали есть и пить шампанское; пришла дама… Я, помню, был очень поражен тем, как пышно она была одета, в зеленом шелковом платье. Тут я все это и увидел… про что вам говорил… Потом, когда мы стали опять пить, он стал ее дразнить и ругать; она сидела без платья; он отнял платье, и когда она стала браниться и просить платье, чтоб одеться, он начал ее изо всей силы хлестать по голым плечам хлыстом. Я встал, схватил его за волосы, и так ловко, что с одного раза бросил на пол. Он схватил вилку и ткнул меня в ляжку. Тут на крик вбежали люди, а я успел убежать. С тех пор мне мерзко вспомнить о наготе; поверьте, была красавица.","- I had a friend, Lambert, in my old boarding school, at Touchard's, even before the gymnasium. He kept beating me, because he was more than three years older, and I served him and took off my boots. When he went to his confirmation, Abbé Rigaud came to congratulate him on his first communion, and both threw themselves on each other's necks in tears, and Abbé Rigaud began to press him terribly to his chest, with various gestures. I also cried and was very jealous. When his father died, he went out, and I did not see him for two years, and two years later I met him on the street. He said he would come to me. I was already in the gymnasium and lived with Nikolai Semenovich. He came in the morning, showed me five hundred rubles and ordered me to go with him. Even though he beat me two years ago, he always needed me, not just for boots; he told me everything. He said that today he stole the money from his mother from the casket, having forged the key, because the money from his father is all his, according to the law, and that she does not dare not give it away, and that yesterday Abbé Rigaud came to him to exhort him - he entered, stood over him and began to whimper, pretend horror and raise his hands to the sky, “and I took out a knife and said that I would stab him” (he said: zagkhezhu). We went to Kuznetsky. On the way, he told me that his mother was in relations with Abbé Rigaud, and that he had noticed this, and that he didn't care about anything, and that everything they said about communion was nonsense. He talked a lot more, but I was afraid. At Kuznetsky he bought a double-barreled gun, a game bag, ready-made cartridges, a riding-whip, and then another pound of sweets. We went out of town to shoot, and on the way we met a bird-catcher with cages; Lambert bought a canary from him. In the grove, he released the canary, since it cannot fly far after the cage, and began to shoot at it, but did not hit. He shot for the first time in his life, and he had long wanted to buy a gun, even from Touchard, and we had long dreamed of a gun. He was definitely choking. His hair was terribly black, his face was white and ruddy, like on a mask, his nose was long and humpy, like that of the French, his teeth were white, his eyes were black. He tied the canary with a thread to a knot and from two trunks, point-blank, a verst of distance, fired two volleys at it, and it scattered into a hundred feathers. Then we returned, drove into a hotel, took a room, began to eat and drink champagne; a lady came ... I remember being very struck by how splendidly she was dressed, in a green silk dress. Then I saw all this ... what I told you about ... Then, when we began to drink again, he began to tease and scold her; she sat without a dress; he took away the dress, and when she began to scold and ask for a dress to put on, he began to whip her with all his might on her bare shoulders with a whip. I got up, grabbed him by the hair, and so deftly that at one time I threw him to the floor. He grabbed a fork and poked me in the thigh. Then people ran in to scream, and I managed to escape. Since then, I hate to think about nudity; Believe me, she was beautiful.","""In Touchard's school, where I went before high school, there was a boy called Lambert. He beat me because he was three years older than me and made me wait on him, pull off his boots and all. When he was going to be confirmed, a priest called Abbe Rigaud came to congratulate him. With wild gestures, they threw themselves into each other's arms, burst into tears, and the abbe pressed Lambert desperately to his breast. I burst into tears too and was very envious of them. . . . Later, when his father died, Lambert left the school, and I hadn't seen him for two years when I met him in the street one day. He said he'd come and see me. By that time, I was already in high school and living at Nikolai Semyonovich's. He came the next morning, showed me five hundred rubles in a big bill, and told me to follow him. Although he'd been beating me up until two years before, he'd always been dependent on me. I don't mean just for pulling off his boots and things like that. He needed someone to confide in, and that was me. And now he told me that he'd stolen the money that very morning out of his mother's strong box, which he'd opened with a copy of the key he'd had made. He explained to me that all the money there was legally his since it had come from his father, and that his mother had no right to refuse to give it to him. ""The day before Abbe Rigaud had come to lecture him about his behavior: he walked into the room, planted himself in front of Lambert, and proceeded to whimper, throwing his arms in the air, making all sorts of disgusted faces, and reproaching him for his ways. ' So,' Lambert said, 'I pulled out a knife and told him that I'd cut his throat for him' (Only he really said th-gh-oat for, being a Frenchman, that's how he pronounced his r's). Then he drove toward Kuznetsky Bridge, and on the way there he told me that he'd found out his mother was having an affair with Abbe Rigaud, that he didn't give a damn really, but that it showed that everything they said about the sacraments was hogwash. He told me many others things and I was quite frightened. On Kuznetsky Bridge, Lambert went shopping. He bought himself a double-barreled shotgun, a game bag, cartridges, a riding whip, and a pound of candy. Then we drove out of the city gates to do some shooting, and on our way we met a bird catcher with bird cages. Lambert bought a canary off him. When we got to a wood Lambert, reckoning that after having been caged for some time a bird wouldn't be able to fly very far, let the canary out and started shooting at it. Still he missed every time. He was firing a shotgun for the first time in his life, although he'd been longing to have a gun even back in our days at Touchard's; in fact, we both had. He seemed out of breath with excitement. His hair was awfully black; his complexion was fair; his cheeks were red as though they had been painted on a mask; his nose was long with a hump in it, the kind many Frenchmen have; his teeth were very white and his eyes black. He finally got hold of the bird, tied it to a branch with a piece of string, and, from an inch or so away, blasted at it out of both barrels. The bird disintegrated into hundreds of feathers. Then we drove back to town, took a room in a hotel, ordered some food and champagne. ""Then a lady arrived. ... I still remember how impressed I was by how gorgeously she was dressed in green silk. And finally I saw all that. . . you know, what we were talking about just now. . . . When we started drinking again, Lambert began to bait the woman and insult her. Since she was sitting without her dress on, he snatched it up. She became annoyed, asked him to give it back to her, said she wanted to get dressed now. Then he took his riding crop and started lashing at her bare shoulders. I got up, grabbed him by the hair, and twisted him so that he fell to the floor. He snatched up a fork and stuck it into my leg. We must have made a lot of noise, for people forced their way into our room. In the general uproar I managed to escape. ... So, since that time, the thought of a naked woman turns my stomach, although I believe that woman was beautiful.""","""In the little boarding school I was at before I went to the grammar school, there was a boy called Lambert. He was always thrashing me, for he was three years older than I was, and I used to wait on him, and take off his boots. When he was going to be confirmed an abbé, called Rigaud, came to congratulate him on his first communion, and they dissolved in tears on each other's necks, and the abbé hugged him tightly to his bosom. I shed tears, too, and felt very envious. He left school when his father died, and for two years I saw nothing of him. Then I met him in the street. He said he would come and see me. By that time I was at the grammar school and living at Nikolay Semyonovitch's. He came in the morning, showed me five hundred roubles, and told me to go with him. Though he had thrashed me two years before, he had always wanted my company, not simply to take off his boots, but because he liked to tell me things. He told me that he had taken the money that day out of his mother's desk, to which he had made a false key, for legally all his father's money was his, and so much the worse for her if she wouldn't give it to him. He said that the Abbé Rigaud had been to lecture him the day before, that he'd come in, stood over him, begun whimpering, and described all sorts of horrors, lifting up his hands to heaven. "" And I pulled out a knife and told him I'd cut his throat"" (he pronounced it 'thr-r-roat'). We went to Kuznetsky Street. On the way he informed me that his mother was the abbé's mistress, and that he'd found it out, and he didn't care a hang for anything, and that all they said about the sacrament was rubbish. He said a great deal more, and I felt frightened. In Kuznetsky Street he bought a double-barrelled gun, a game bag, cartridges, a riding-whip, and afterwards a pound of sweets. We were going out into the country to shoot, and on the way we met a bird-catcher with cages of birds. Lambert bought a canary from him. In a wood he let the canary go, as it couldn't fly far after being in the cage, and began shooting at it, but did not hit it. It was the first time in his life he had fired off a gun, but he had wanted to buy a gun years before; at Touchard's even we were dreaming of one. He was almost choking with excitement. His hair was black, awfully black, his face was white and red, like a mask, he had a long aquiline nose, such as are common with Frenchmen, white teeth and black eyes. He tied the canary by a thread to a branch, and an inch away fired off both barrels, and the bird was blown into a hundred feathers. Then we returned, drove to an hotel, took a room, and began eating, and drinking champagne; a lady came in… . I remember being awfully impressed by her being so splendidly dressed; she wore a green silk dress. It was then I saw … all that I told you about… . Afterwards, when we had begun drinking, he began taunting and abusing her; she was sitting with nothing on, he took away her clothes and when she began scolding and asking for her clothes to dress again, he began with all his might beating her with the riding-whip on her bare shoulders. I got up, seized him by the hair, and so neatly that I threw him on the ground at once. He snatched up a fork and stuck it in my leg. Hearing the outcry, people ran in, and I had time to run away. Ever since then it's disgusted me to think of nakedness; and, believe me, she was a beauty."""
"И не напрасно приснился отрок. Только что Максим Иванович о сем изрек, почти, так сказать, в самую ту минуту приключилось с новорожденным нечто: вдруг захворал. И болело дитя восемь дней, молились неустанно, и докторов призывали, и выписали из Москвы самого первого доктора по чугунке.

The doctor arrived and got angry. “I, he says, is the very first doctor, all of Moscow is waiting for me.” Prescribed drops and left hastily. He took away eight hundred rubles. And the baby died in the evening.","And it was not for nothing that the boy had come to him. The moment Maxim had spoken, the newborn babe became sick. The sickness lasted eight days.

""I'm the greatest doctor in Moscow,"" he said, ""so what do you mean by sending for me for such a trifling thing when all Moscow is waiting for me?"" He prescribed some drops, charged them eight hundred rubles, and left in a great hurry. That same evening the baby died.","The boy had not come to him in his dream for nothing.

"Я просидел один, обдумывая часа полтора; не обдумывая, впрочем, а лишь задумавшись. Хоть я был и смущен, но зато нимало не удивлен. Я даже ждал еще пуще чего-нибудь, еще больших чудес. «Может, они теперь уж и натворили их», – подумал я. Я твердо и давно был уверен, еще дома, что машина у них заведена и в полном ходу. «Меня только им недостает, вот что», – подумал я опять, с каким-то раздражительным и приятным самодовольством. Что они ждут меня изо всех сил и что-то в моей квартире затевают устроить – было ясно как день. «Уж не свадьбу ли старого князя? на него целая облава. Только позволю ли я, господа, вот что-с?» – заключил я опять с надменным удовольствием.","I sat alone, thinking for an hour and a half; not thinking, however, but only thinking. Although I was embarrassed, I was not in the least surprised. I was even expecting something even greater, even greater miracles. “Perhaps they have already done them,” I thought. I was firmly and for a long time convinced, even at home, that their car was running and in full swing. “The only thing they lack is me, that’s what,” I thought again, with a kind of irritable and pleasant self-satisfaction. That they were waiting for me with all their might and that they were planning to arrange something in my apartment was clear as day. “Is it the wedding of the old prince? there's a whole spree on him. But will I allow it, gentlemen, is that it?” I concluded again with haughty pleasure.","Left alone, I sat down to think it all over and I sat without moving for an hour and a half. Only, instead of making sense out of what I'd just learned, I got lost in my thoughts. I felt confused but not in the least surprised. As a matter of fact, I was expecting even stranger things to happen. Perhaps they've already pulled off something, I thought. For quite some time, I'd had the feeling that the machinery of their plot had been set in motion and I thought that by now it must be in full swing. ""All they've been waiting for is me!"" flashed through my mind, accompanied by a feeling of peculiar, rather pleasant irritation mixed with conceit. The fact that they were waiting for me and that they were planning to organize something or other in my apartment was clear as day. Could it be, by any chance, the marriage of old Prince Nikolai? Well, would I oblige those ladies and gentlemen?

Though I was perplexed I was not in the least surprised. I even expected to hear something more, other marvels. "" Perhaps they have already hatched them,"" I thought.

""They're only waiting for me,"" I thought again with a sort of irritable and pleasant self-satisfaction. That they were eagerly awaiting me, and were scheming to carry out some plan at my lodging was clear as day. ""The old prince's wedding, can it be? He's surrounded by a regular network of intrigue.

"Когда я выдумал «мою идею» (а в красном-то каленье она и состоит), я стал себя пробовать: способен ли я на монастырь и на схимничество? С этою целью я целый первый месяц ел только один хлеб с водой. Черного хлеба выходило не более двух с половиною фунтов ежедневно. Чтобы исполнить это, я должен был обманывать умного Николая Семеновича и желавшую мне добра Марью Ивановну. Я настоял на том, к ее огорчению и к некоторому недоумению деликатнейшего Николая Семеновича, чтобы обед приносили в мою комнату. Там я просто истреблял его: суп выливал в окно в крапиву или в одно другое место, говядину – или кидал в окно собаке, или, завернув в бумагу, клал в карман и выносил потом вон, ну и все прочее. Так как хлеба к обеду подавали гораздо менее двух с половиной фунтов, то потихоньку хлеб прикупал от себя. Я этот месяц выдержал, может быть только несколько расстроил желудок; но с следующего месяца я прибавил к хлебу суп, а утром и вечером по стакану чаю – и, уверяю вас, так провел год в совершенном здоровье и довольстве, а нравственно – в упоении и в непрерывном тайном восхищении. Я не только не жалел о кушаньях, но был в восторге. По окончании года, убедившись, что я в состоянии выдержать какой угодно пост, я стал есть, как и они, и перешел обедать с ними вместе. Не удовлетворившись этой пробой, я сделал и вторую: на карманные расходы мои, кроме содержания, уплачиваемого Николаю Семеновичу, мне полагалось ежемесячно по пяти рублей. Я положил из них тратить лишь половину. Это было очень трудное испытание, но через два с лишком года, при приезде в Петербург, у меня в кармане, кроме других денег, было семьдесят рублей, накопленных единственно из этого сбережения. Результат двух этих опытов был для меня громадный: я узнал положительно, что могу настолько хотеть, что достигну моей цели, а в этом, повторяю, вся «моя идея»; дальнейшее – все пустяки.","When I came up with “my idea” (and it is red-hot), I began to test myself: am I capable of a monastery and scheming? To this end, for the first month I ate only one bread and water. Black bread came out no more than two and a half pounds daily. To do this, I had to deceive the intelligent Nikolai Semyonovich and Marya Ivanovna, who wished me well. I insisted, to her chagrin and to some bewilderment of the most delicate Nikolai Semyonovich, that dinner be brought to my room. There I simply exterminated it: I poured soup out the window into nettles or some other place, beef - or threw it out the window to the dog, or wrapped it in paper, put it in my pocket and then took it out, and everything else. Since bread for dinner was served much less than two and a half pounds, I slowly bought bread from myself. I survived this month, perhaps only upset my stomach a little; but from the next month I added soup to the bread, and in the morning and in the evening a glass of tea - and, I assure you, I spent the year in perfect health and contentment, and morally - in ecstasy and in continuous secret admiration. Not only did I not regret the food, but I was delighted. At the end of the year, having convinced myself that I was able to endure any kind of fast, I began to eat like them, and went to dine with them. Not satisfied with this test, I made a second one: for my pocket expenses, in addition to the maintenance paid to Nikolai Semenovich, I was supposed to pay five rubles a month. I set out to spend only half of them. It was a very difficult test, but more than two years later, when I arrived in St. Petersburg, in my pocket, besides other money, I had seventy rubles accumulated solely from this savings. The result of these two experiments was enormous for me: I learned positively that I can want so much that I will achieve my goal, and this, I repeat, is the whole “my idea”; What follows is all nonsense.","When my ""idea"" occurred to me (it consists in keeping oneself constantly in a state of white heat), I started testing myself : Was I capable of monastic life, or asceticism? To find the answer, I lived for a whole month on nothing but bread and water, about two and a half pounds of rye bread a day, to be precise. I had to do it without the knowledge of Nikolai Semyonovich, who was an intelligent man, and of his wife Maria, who was very concerned with my welfare. I insisted on being allowed to eat alone in my room, which saddened Maria greatly and perplexed the tactful Nikolai. Then I disposed of my dinner by throwing the soup either out the window into the nettles or you know where and feeding the meat to the dog or, wrapping it up in paper, smuggling it out in my pocket and flingling it far away from the house. Since they gave me considerably less bread than I required, I secretly bought more bread. I stuck that month out, suffering nothing worse than an upset stomach in the process. The following month I added a little soup to my diet and allowed myself to drink one cup of tea in the morning and another in the evening. I kept this up for a whole year. Well, let me assure you, I felt very healthy and pleased with life; morally, it gave me a great boost and it was a constant secret satisfaction to me. Not only did I not long for the food I was refusing myself, but I even felt happy not to have it. After a year, when I was convinced that I could stand being deprived of all sorts of food, I resumed having dinner with Maria and Nikolai. But that was not the only test I put myself through. I tested myself by deciding not to spend more than half of the five rubles pocket money that I received every month (my board was paid directly to Nikolai). That was a very hard test, but I passed it too and thus accumulated seventy rubles in just over two years, which, along with some other money, was what I had in my pocket when I arrived in Petersburg. The results of these two tests were tremendously important to me, for I had found out that I could definitely want strongly enough, that I would reach my goal. So this is my whole idea, for the rest is just details.","When I thought of my ""idea"" and it was forged in white heat, I began asking myself—am I capable of asceticism? With this object, for the whole of the first month I took bread and water, not more than two and a half pounds of black bread a day. To do this I was obliged to deceive Nikolay Semyonovitch who was clever, and Marie Ivanovna who was anxious for my welfare. Though I wounded her and somewhat surprised Nikolay Semyonovitch who was a man of great delicacy, I insisted on having my dinner brought to my room. There I simply got rid of it. I poured the soup out of window on to the nettles or elsewhere, the meat I either flung out of window to a dog, or wrapping it up in paper put it in my pocket and threw it away after, and so on. As the bread given me for dinner was much less than two and a half pounds I bought bread on the sly. I stood this for a month perhaps, only upsetting my stomach a little, but the next month I added soup to the bread and drank a glass of tea morning and evening, and I assure you I passed a year like that in perfect health and content, as well as in a moral ecstasy and perpetual secret delight. Far from regretting the dainties I missed, I was overjoyed. At the end of the year, having convinced myself I was capable of standing any fast, however severe, I began eating as they did, and went back to dine with them. Not satisfied with this experiment I made a second; apart from the sum paid to Nikolay Semyonovitch for my board I was allowed five roubles a month for pocket money. I resolved to spend only half. This was a very great trial, but after at most two years I had in my pocket by the time I went to Petersburg seventy roubles saved entirely in this way, besides other money. The result of these two experiments was of vast importance to me: I had learnt positively that I could so will a thing as to attain my objects, and that I repeat is the essence of ""my idea""—the rest is all nonsense."

"Я только потерял время. Выйдя, я тотчас пустился отыскивать квартиру; но я был рассеян, пробродил несколько часов по улицам и хоть зашел в пять или шесть квартир от жильцов, но уверен, что мимо двадцати прошел, не заметив их. К еще пущей досаде, я и не воображал, что нанимать квартиры так трудно. Везде комнаты, как васинская, и даже гораздо хуже, а цены огромные, то есть не по моему расчету. Я прямо требовал угла, чтоб только повернуться, и мне презрительно давали знать, что в таком случае надо идти «в углы». Кроме того, везде множество странных жильцов, с которыми я уж по одному виду их не мог бы ужиться рядом; даже заплатил бы, чтоб не жить рядом. Какие-то господа без сюртуков, в одних жилетах, с растрепанными бородами, развязные и любопытные. В одной крошечной комнате сидело их человек десять за картами и за пивом, а рядом мне предлагали комнату. В других местах я сам на расспросы хозяев отвечал так нелепо, что на меня глядели с удивлением, а в одной квартире так даже поссорился. Впрочем, не описывать же всех этих ничтожностей; я только хочу сказать, что, устав ужасно, я поел чего-то в одной кухмистерской, уже почти когда смерклось. У меня разрешилось окончательно, что я пойду, отдам сейчас сам и один Версилову письмо о наследстве (без всяких объяснений), захвачу сверху мои вещи в чемодан и узел и перееду на ночь хоть в гостиницу. В конце Обуховского проспекта, у Триумфальных ворот, я знал, есть постоялые дворы, где можно достать даже особую комнатку за тридцать копеек; на одну ночь я решился пожертвовать, только чтоб не ночевать у Версилова. И вот, проходя уже мимо Технологического института, мне вдруг почему-то вздумалось зайти к Татьяне Павловне, которая жила тут же напротив Технологического. Собственно, предлогом зайти было все то же письмо о наследстве, но непреодолимое мое побуждение зайти, конечно, имело другие причины, которых я, впрочем, не сумею и теперь разъяснить: тут была какая-то путаница в уме о «грудном ребенке», «об исключениях, входящих в общее правило». Хотелось ли мне рассказать, или порисоваться, или подраться, или даже заплакать – не знаю, только я поднялся к Татьяне Павловне. Я был у ней доселе всего лишь один раз, в начале моего приезда из Москвы, по какому-то поручению от матери, и помню: зайдя и передав порученное, ушел через минуту, даже и не присев, а она и не попросила.","I just lost time. Coming out, I immediately set off to look for an apartment; but I was distracted, wandered for several hours through the streets, and although I went into five or six apartments from the tenants, I am sure that I passed twenty without noticing them. To my greater annoyance, I had no idea that renting an apartment was so difficult. Everywhere rooms are like Vasya's, and even much worse, and the prices are huge, that is, not according to my calculation. I directly demanded a corner just to turn around, and they contemptuously let me know that in such a case I had to go ""to the corners."" Besides, there are a lot of strange tenants everywhere, with whom, by their very appearance, I could not get along side by side; I would even pay not to live next door. Some gentlemen without frock coats, in nothing but waistcoats, with disheveled beards, cheeky and inquisitive. In one tiny room, about ten of them were sitting at cards and drinking beer, and next to me they offered me a room. In other places, I myself answered the questions of the owners so absurdly that they looked at me with surprise, and in one apartment I even quarreled. However, do not describe all these insignificances; I just want to say that, being terribly tired, I ate something in a kitchen shop, almost when it was already dark. I finally resolved that I would go, give myself and one to Versilov a letter of inheritance (without any explanation), grab my things from above in a suitcase and a bundle, and move to a hotel for the night. At the end of Obukhovsky Prospekt, near the Triumphal Gates, I knew there were inns where you could even get a special room for thirty kopecks; for one night I decided to sacrifice, only so as not to spend the night at Versilov's. And now, already passing by the Technological Institute, for some reason I suddenly decided to go to Tatyana Pavlovna, who lived right there opposite the Technological Institute. Actually, the same letter about the inheritance was the pretext to come in, but my irresistible impulse to come in, of course, had other reasons, which, however, I will not be able to explain even now: there was some kind of confusion in the mind about the “baby”, “ on exceptions to the general rule. Whether I wanted to tell, or show off, or fight, or even cry - I don’t know, only I went up to Tatyana Pavlovna. I have been to her only once so far, at the beginning of my arrival from Moscow, on some instructions from my mother, and I remember: having entered and handed over the commissioned, I left a minute later, without even sitting down, and she did not ask.","It had all been just a waste of time and when I left I knew I'd better quickly find a room. But I couldn't concentrate and, after having wandered around the streets for a few hours and entered five or six apartments with ""rooms to let,"" I found nothing suitable and I'm sure I must have passed a score of such signs without noticing them. The fact that it turned out to be much harder to find a lodging than I had imagined added further to my annoyance. The rooms I saw were at best like Vasin's, often much worse, but the rent was enormous, far above what I was prepared to pay. I asked for a corner with just enough room to turn round in and they told me scornfully that if that's what I was looking for I'd have a better chance in a flophouse. Moreover, I caught sight here and there of some peculiar-looking lodgers with whom I'd have hated to live under the same roof, so much so, in fact, that I'd have paid not to live near them. There were some characters walking around in vests and shirt sleeves, with disheveled beards, nosy and ill-mannered. In one apartment, I saw about ten such characters sitting in a tiny room drinking beer and playing cards, while the landlady was trying to rent me the room next door. In other places, I gave such absurd answers to the landladies' questions that they stared at me in surprise and in one particular place it even finished in an unpleasant scene. I'm certainly not going to describe this squalid search in great detail, but I'll just say that it made me feel terribly tired and, as it was already getting dark, I entered a small cafe to get something to eat. I definitely decided to go straight back and give Versilov the letter about the inheritance without any explanation; I'd pack my belongings in my suitcase, make a bundle out of the rest, and move to a hotel for the night. I knew that there were some inns at the far end of Obukhov Avenue near the Gate of Triumph where you could get a single room for thirty kopeks and I decided to sacrifice that sum rather than spend one more night under Versilov's roof. But then, as I was passing the Technological Institute, I remembered that Mrs. Prutkov lived just across the street and for some reason I decided to drop in on her. The most tangible reason for my visit was, of course, that letter again, but my sudden overwhelming impulse to go and see her must have been due to other causes that I still cannot quite explain—they had to do with the obscure remarks I'd just heard about a certain baby and about certain exceptions becoming the rule. ... I don't know whether I was driven by a need to get something off my chest, to show off my noble feelings, to have a fight with her, or perhaps even to have a good cry in her presence, but for whatever reason I went up to Tatyana Prutkov's. I'd been to Mrs. Prutkov's only once before. It was soon after my arrival from Moscow and I'd gone there on an errand for my mother. I'd just stayed for a minute and left without even sitting down. Indeed, she hadn't asked me to.","I had merely wasted my time. On coming out I set to work at once to look for lodgings; but I was preoccupied. I wandered about the streets for several hours, and, though I went into five or six flats with rooms to let, I am sure I passed by twenty without noticing them. To increase my vexation I found it far more difficult to get a lodging than I had imagined. Everywhere there were rooms like Vassin's, or a great deal worse, while the rent was enormous, that is, not what I had reckoned upon. I asked for nothing more than a ""corner"" where I could turn round, and I was informed contemptuously that if that was what I wanted, I must go where rooms were let ""in corners. "" Moreover, I found everywhere numbers of strange lodgers, in whose proximity I could not have lived; in fact, I would have paid anything not to have to live in their proximity. There were queer gentlemen in their waistcoats without their coats, who had dishevelled beards, and were inquisitive and free-and-easy in their manners. In one tiny room there were about a dozen such sitting over cards and beer, and I was offered the next room. In another place I answered the landlady's inquiries so absurdly that they looked at me in surprise, and in one flat I actually began quarrelling with the people. However, I won't describe these dismal details; I only felt that I was awfully tired. I had something to eat in a cookshop when it was almost dark. I finally decided that I would go and give Versilov the letter concerning the will, with no one else present (making no explanation), that I would go upstairs, pack my things in my trunk and bag, and go for the night, if need be, to an hotel. At the end of the Obuhovsky Prospect, at the Gate of Triumph, I knew there was an inn where one could get a room to oneself for thirty kopecks; I resolved for one night to sacrifice that sum, rather than sleep at Versilov's. And as I was passing the Institute of Technology, the notion suddenly struck me to call on Tatyana Pavlovna, who lived just opposite the institute. My pretext for going in was this same letter about the will, but my overwhelming impulse to go in was due to some other cause, which I cannot to this day explain. My mind was in a turmoil, brooding over ""the baby,"" the ""exceptions that pass into rules. "" I had a longing to tell some one, or to make a scene, or to fight, or even to have a cry—I can't tell which, but I went up to Tatyana Pavlovna's. I had only been there once before, with some message from my mother, soon after I came from Moscow, and I remember I went in, gave my message, and went out a minute later, without sitting down, and indeed she did not ask me to."

Apparently, instead of obtaining the information she wanted, she had received a rude answer, for she came down the steps of the shop seething with impatient anger.","This interview followed under strange and exceptional circumstances.

No, you don't appreciate that he brought you to the university and that through him you got your rights. The boys, you see, they teased him, so he swore to take revenge on humanity ... You are such a bastard!","""Ah, now I can see through you once and for all!"" Mrs. Prutkov exclaimed, jumping up from her seat with such suddenness that she took me completely by surprise. ""Not only did you have a flunkey's mentality then, you still have a flunkey's mentality today, the soul of a true lackey! I wonder why Andrei didn't place you as an apprentice to a bootmaker! That would've been doing you a favor—at least you'd have learned a trade. Who could've asked more of him? Your father, Makar Dolgoruky, begged and even demanded that his children be left in the social class where they belonged and not be pushed above their natural station in life. Why, you don't even appreciate that Andrei gave you the opportunity to study all the way to the doors of the university and that, thanks to him, you have all the privileges and advantages of a gentleman. But the little boys teased you and you swore to wreak vengeance on humankind. . . . No, you're an ungrateful little beast, that's what you are!""","It was from that moment that I realized that besides being a lackey, I was a coward, too, and my real development began!"" ""Well, I see through you once and for all from this minute,"" cried Tatyana Pavlovna, jumping up from her seat, and so suddenly, that I was utterly unprepared for it; ""yes, you were not only a lackey then, you are a lackey now; you've the soul of a lackey! Why should not Andrey Petrovitch have apprenticed you to a shoemaker? it would have been an act of charity to have taught you a trade! Who would have expected more than that of him? Your father, Makar Ivanovitch, asked— in fact, he insisted—that you, his children, should not be brought up to be above your station. Why, you think nothing of his having educated you for the university, and that through him you have received class rights. The little rascals teased him, to be sure, so he has sworn to avenge himself on humanity… . You scoundrel!"""

"– Торопишься? Да неужели же я недостаточно опоздал, по-твоему! Тебе ли, тебе ли, Лиза, мне так говорить? – увлекся я наконец полным негодованием. – А сколько я вынес позору, и как этот князь должен был меня презирать! О, мне теперь все ясно, и вся эта картина передо мной: он вполне вообразил, что я уже давно догадался о его связи с тобой, но молчу или даже подымаю нос и похваляюсь «честью» – вот что он даже мог обо мне подумать! И за сестру, за позор сестры беру деньги! Вот что ему было омерзительно видеть, и я его оправдываю вполне: каждый день видать и принимать подлеца, потому что он – ей брат, да еще говорит о чести… это сердце иссохнет, хоть бы и его сердце! И ты все это допустила, ты не предупредила меня! Он до того презирал меня, что говорил обо мне Стебелькову и сам сказал мне вчера, что хотел нас обоих с Версиловым выгнать. А Стебельков-то! «Анна Андреевна ведь – такая же вам сестрица, как и Лизавета Макаровна», да еще кричит мне вслед: «Мои деньги лучше». А я-то, я-то нахально разваливался у него на диванах и лез, как ровня, к его знакомым, черт бы их взял! И ты все это допустила! Пожалуй, и Дарзан теперь знает, судя по крайней мере по тону его вчера вечером… Все, все знают, кроме меня!","– Are you in a hurry? Am I not late enough, in your opinion! Do you, do you, Liza, should I say so? I finally got carried away with complete indignation. - And how much shame I endured, and how this prince should have despised me! Oh, everything is clear to me now, and this whole picture is in front of me: he quite imagined that I had long guessed about his connection with you, but I am silent or even raise my nose and boast of “honor” - that’s what he even could think of me! And for my sister, for the disgrace of my sister, I take money! This is what he was disgusted to see, and I fully justify him: to see and accept a scoundrel every day, because he is her brother, and he also speaks of honor ... this heart will dry up, even if his heart too! And you let it all happen, you didn't warn me! He despised me so much that he spoke about me to Stebelkov and himself told me yesterday that he wanted to drive both of us and Versilov out. And Stebelkov something! “Anna Andreevna, after all, is the same sister to you as Lizaveta Makarovna,” and she even shouts after me: “My money is better.” And I, I impudently lounged on his sofas and climbed, like an equal, to his acquaintances, damn them! And you allowed it all! Perhaps even Darzan now knows, judging at least by his tone last night... Everyone, everyone knows, except me!","But you seem to be in a great hurry to deliberately hurt yourself."" ""You say I'm in a hurry? So you don't think I'm rather late in finding out? Is it really right for you, Lisa, to say that to me? "" I was gradually giving way completely to my indignation. ""Can you imagine how much ignominy I've had to bear and how much that prince of yours must despise me now? You know, he was absolutely sure that I'd been aware of your affair with him for a long time but that I was saying nothing and turning up my nose at him so as to be able to hold forth to him about honor. And he even imagined that I was capable of accepting his money in payment for your disgrace! And if he found it sickening, I can hardly blame him! How else could he feel about a fellow whom he receives only because he's her brother and who keeps talking to him about honor? That would be enough to turn anyone's stomach! And you allowed all that to happen; you never even thought of warning me! He despised me so much that he even told Stebelkov that I was accepting money from him, and last night to my face he declared that he couldn't wait for the day when he'd be able to kick Versilov and me out of his house. And then even Stebelkov reminded me that, after all, Anna was as much a sister to me as Lisa and that his money was better than Sergei's. . . . And all that time I was insolently sprawling on Sergei's sofa, playing at being his equal, trying to be familiar with his lousy friends! Well, it was you, you, who allowed all that to happen! I suppose that Darzan knows now, at least judging from his tone last night. . . . Oh, everybody must know it except for me!""","""Too great a hurry? Why, do you think I've not been slow enough! Is it for you, Liza, to say that to me?"" I cried, completely carried away by indignation at last. "" And what shame I've endured, and how that prince must despise me! It's all clear to me now, and I can see it all like a picture : he quite imagined that I had guessed long ago what his relation was to you, but that I held my tongue or even turned up my nose while I bragged of 'my honour'— that's what he may well have thought of me! And that I have been taking his money for my sister, for my sister's shame! It was that he loathed so, and I think he was quite right, too; to have every day to welcome a scoundrel because he was her brother, and then to talk of honour … it would turn any heart to stone, even his! And you allowed it all, you did not warn me! He despised me so utterly that he talked of me to Stebelkov, and told me yesterday that he longed to get rid of us both, Versilov and me. And Stebelkov too! ' Anna Andreyevna is as much your sister as Lizaveta Makarovna,' and then he shouted after me, 'My money's better than his.' And I, I insolently lolled on HIS sofa, and forced myself on his acquaintances as though I were an equal, damn them! And you allowed all that!

"Но если ждал меня Ламберт, то еще пуще, может быть, ждала меня Анна Андреевна. Прямо скажу: Ламберт отчасти мог быть и прав, готовясь ей изменить, и вина была на ее стороне. Несмотря на несомненное их соглашение (в какой форме, не знаю, но в котором не сомневаюсь), – Анна Андреевна до самой последней минуты была с ним не вполне откровенна. Не раскрылась на всю распашку. Она намекнула ему на все согласия с своей стороны и на все обещания – но только лишь намекнула; выслушала, может быть, весь его план до подробностей, но одобрила лишь молчанием. Я имею твердые данные так заключить, а причина всему та, что – ждала меня. Она лучше хотела иметь дело со мной, чем с мерзавцем Ламбертом, – вот несомненный для меня факт! Это я понимаю; но ошибка ее состояла в том, что это понял наконец и Ламберт. А ему слишком было бы невыгодно, если б она, мимо его, выманила у меня документ и вошла бы со мной в соглашение. К тому же в то время он уже был уверен в крепости «дела». Другой бы на его месте трусил и все бы еще сомневался; но Ламберт был молод, дерзок, с нетерпеливейшей жаждой наживы, мало знал людей и несомненно предполагал их всех подлыми; такой усумниться не мог, тем более что уже выпытал у Анны Андреевны все главнейшие подтверждения.","But if Lambert was waiting for me, then Anna Andreyevna, perhaps even more, was waiting for me. Frankly, Lambert could be partly right in preparing to cheat on her, and the fault was on her side. Despite their undoubted agreement (in what form, I don’t know, but which I have no doubt), Anna Andreevna was not completely frank with him until the very last minute. Didn't open all the way. She hinted to him of all the consents on her part and of all the promises - but only only a hint; listened, perhaps, to his whole plan to the details, but approved only in silence. I have solid data to conclude so, and the reason for everything is that it was waiting for me. She wanted to do business with me rather than with the scoundrel Lambert - that's an undoubted fact for me! I understand it; but her mistake was that Lambert understood this at last. And it would be too unprofitable for him if she, bypassing him, lured the document from me and entered into an agreement with me. In addition, at that time he was already confident in the strength of the “case”. Another would have been cowardly in his place and still doubted; but Lambert was young, impudent, with the most impatient greed for gain, knew little of people, and doubtless assumed them all vile; he could not doubt such a thing, all the more so since he had already extorted from Anna Andreevna all the main confirmations.","But, however anxiously Lambert may have been waiting for me, Anna's anxiety must have been even greater. I can safely say that Lambert may have had good reason to prepare an alternative plan to betray her, and it was perhaps really her fault. Despite their obvious agreement (I don't know exactly in what form, but there is no doubt whatsoever that they had an agreement), Anna was never completely open with him up to the very last moment. She never really laid all her cards on the table. She hinted that she was willing to go along with all his suggestions, leading him to believe that she was promising him what he was asking for, but it was only an implied agreement: she listened to what he had to say but offered him nothing but an approving silence. I have good evidence for this, and the reason for her behavior was that she was waiting for me. To be sure, she would rather deal with me than with a rogue like Lambert. I understood that, but the trouble was that Lambert finally understood it too. It wouldn't have suited his plans at all if, bypassing him, she made a deal directly with me and persuaded me to give her the letter, especially since Lambert had become quite convinced of the ""soundness of the business."" Another man might still have had misgivings and hesitated, but Lambert was young, impetuous, impatient for gain, and had little understanding of human nature, since to him everybody was just a plain scoundrel. A man like him could have no doubts, especially since his talk with Anna had confirmed all the information he already had and all his hopes were based on that information.","But however eagerly Lambert may have been expecting me, Anna Andreyevna perhaps was awaiting me even more eagerly. I must say frankly that Lambert was to some extent right in his reckoning when he contemplated throwing her over, and it was her own fault. In spite of the agreement that no doubt existed between them (in what form I don't know, but I have no doubt about it), Anna Andreyevna up to the very last moment was not fully open with him. She did not lay all her cards on the table. She hinted at complete agreement on her part and at all sorts of promises—but she confined herself to hints. She listened perhaps to his whole plan in detail; but she only approved in silence. I have good evidence for this conclusion, and the reason of it all was THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME. She would rather have had to do with me than with the rascally Lambert —that's a fact I have no doubt of. That I understand; but her mistake was in letting Lambert at last understand it. And it would not have suited him at all, if passing him by she had enticed the letter out of me and entered into a compact with me. Moreover, at that time he had complete confidence in the ""soundness of the job""; another man in his place would have had fears and still have been uncertain; but Lambert was young, insolent, and filled with impatient greed for gain; he knew little of human nature, and confidently assumed that all were scoundrels. Such a man could have no doubts, especially as he had already observed all sorts of traits in Anna Andreyevna which supported his belief."

"Я прибежал к Ламберту. О, как ни желал бы я придать логический вид и отыскать хоть малейший здравый смысл в моих поступках в тот вечер и во всю ту ночь, но даже и теперь, когда могу уже все сообразить, я никак не в силах представить дело в надлежащей ясной связи. Тут было чувство или, лучше сказать, целый хаос чувств, среди которых я, естественно, должен был заблудиться. Правда, тут было одно главнейшее чувство, меня подавлявшее и над всем командовавшее, но… признаваться ли в нем? Тем более что я не уверен…","I ran to Lambert. Oh, how much I would like to put a logical look and find even the slightest common sense in my actions that evening and all that night, but even now, when I can already figure everything out, I can’t put the matter in proper clear connection. .

True, there was one most important feeling here, which suppressed me and commanded everything, but ... should I admit it? Especially since I'm not sure...","I ran all the way to Lambert's. Oh, I'd have so liked to give an appearance of logic and discover be it only a trace of common sense in my behavior throughout that evening and night! But, alas, even today I cannot offer a clear, understandable explanation of my conduct. I was guided by feelings, or a whole raft of chaotic feelings, in which naturally enough I couldn't fail to get lost. True, there was a dominant feeling among these that exerted tremendous pressure on me in propelling me in one direction. . . . But need I really confess that, especially since I'm not even absolutely certain . . . ?","I ran to Lambert. Oh, how I should have liked to give a show of logic to my behaviour, and to find some trace of common sense in my actions that evening and all that night; but even now, when I can reflect on it all, I am utterly unable to present my conduct in any clear and logical connection. It was a case of feeling, or rather a perfect chaos of feelings, in the midst of which I was naturally bound to go astray. It is true there was one dominant feeling, which mastered me completely and overwhelmed all the others, but … need I confess to it? Especially as I am not certain… ."

"Сам он очень молчал, сидел напротив меня и, сильно наклонившись ко мне, слушал не отрываясь; порой улыбался длинной, долгой улыбкой, скалил зубы и прищуривал глаза, как бы усиленно соображая и желая угадать. Я сохранил ясное воспоминание лишь о том, что когда рассказывал ему о «документе», то никак не мог понятливо выразиться и толком связать рассказ, и по лицу его слишком видел, что он никак не может понять меня, но что ему очень бы хотелось понять, так что даже он рискнул остановить меня вопросом, что было опасно, потому что я тотчас, чуть перебивали меня, сам перебивал тему и забывал, о чем говорил. Сколько времени мы просидели и проговорили так – я не знаю и даже сообразить не могу. Он вдруг встал и позвал Альфонсину:","He himself was very silent, sat opposite me and, leaning heavily towards me, listened without stopping; sometimes he smiled a long, long smile, bared his teeth and screwed up his eyes, as if thinking hard and wanting to guess. I retained a clear memory only of the fact that when I told him about the “document”, I could not express myself intelligibly and plainly connect the story, and I saw too much from his face that he could not understand me at all, but that he would very much like to understand so that even he risked stopping me with a question, which was dangerous, because I immediately interrupted me a little, interrupted the topic myself and forgot what I was talking about. How long we sat and talked like this - I don’t know and I can’t even figure it out. He suddenly got up and called to Alfonsina:","He sat facing me, his head bent in my direction, and listened practically without moving. Now and then a broad, slow smile would uncover his flashing teeth and he would half close his eyes as if trying hard to follow me or to work something out. I have kept a clear recollection only of the moment when I started telling him about that letter-document. I couldn't find the right words to convey it all so he would understand, and I could tell by his expression that he couldn't grasp what I was saying but that he was very eager to, so eager, in fact, that he ventured to interrupt me with a question, which was very risky since an interruption was likely to make me forget altogether what I had been talking about and start me off on another subject. How long we sat like that , with me talking and him listening, I have no idea and couldn't even guess, but at one point he suddenly got up and called Alphonsine.","He was very silent himself, he sat facing me and bending close down to me, listened without moving; at times he smiled, a broad slow smile, showing his teeth, and screwing up his eyes as though reflecting intensely and trying to guess something.

How long we sat and talked like this I don't know and cannot even imagine. He suddenly got up and called to Alphonsine."

"Вбежал я к Ламберту, разумеется, вне себя. Я даже испугал было его и Альфонсинку. Я всегда замечал, что даже самые забулдыжные, самые потерянные французы чрезмерно привержены в своем домашнем быту к некоторого рода буржуазному порядку, к некоторого рода самому прозаическому, обыденно-обрядному образу раз навсегда заведенной жизни. Впрочем, Ламберт очень скоро понял, что нечто случилось, и пришел в восторг, видя наконец меня у себя, обладая наконец мною. А он об этом только и думал, день и ночь, эти дни! О, как я ему был нужен! И вот, когда уже он потерял всю надежду, я вдруг являюсь сам, да еще в таком безумии – именно в том виде, в каком ему было надо.","I ran to Lambert, besides myself, of course. I even scared him and Alfonsin. I have always noticed that even the most delusional, the most lost Frenchmen are excessively attached in their domestic life to a kind of bourgeois order, to a kind of the most prosaic, ordinary-ceremonial image of a once-for-all wound up life. However, Lambert very soon realized that something had happened, and was delighted to see me at last, possessing me at last. And he only thought about it, day and night, these days! Oh, how he needed me! And now, when he has already lost all hope, I suddenly appear myself, and even in such madness - exactly in the form in which he needed.","Obviously I was in quite a state when I reached Lambert's. I even frightened them both, him and Alphonsine. I've often noticed that even the most dissolute of Frenchmen are excessively addicted to their bourgeois routine when it comes to their domestic life, to a sort of daily, dull ritual of life established once and for all. Lambert, however, soon recovered, realized that this was a lucky break for him, that finally he had me there, in his lair, at his mercy! Oh, he hadn't thought of anything else throughout the past few days! He needed me desperately! And now, when he'd practically lost all hope of getting hold of me, here I was suddenly turning up of my own accord, moreover in a quite abnormal state. What more could he want?","I ran to Lambert, beside myself of course. I positively scared Alphonsine and him for the first minute.

Lambert quickly realised, however, that something had happened, and was delighted that I had come to him at last, and that I was IN HIS CLUTCHES. He had been thinking of nothing else day and night!

"Татьяна Павловна, подхватив меня, посадила на извозчика и привезла к себе, немедленно приказала самовар и сама отмыла и отчистила меня у себя в кухне. В кухне же громко сказала мне, что в половине двенадцатого к ней будет сама Катерина Николаевна – как еще давеча они условились обе – для свидания со мной. Вот тут-то и услышала Марья. Через несколько минут она подала самовар, а еще через две минуты, когда Татьяна Павловна вдруг ее кликнула, она не отозвалась: оказалось, что она зачем-то вышла. Это я прошу очень заметить читателя; было же тогда, я полагаю, без четверти десять часов. Хоть Татьяна Павловна и рассердилась на ее исчезновение без спросу, но подумала лишь, что она вышла в лавочку, и тут же пока забыла об этом. Да и не до того нам было; мы говорили без умолку, потому что было о чем, так что я, например, на исчезновение Марьи совсем почти и не обратил внимания; прошу читателя и это запомнить.","Tatyana Pavlovna, picking me up, put me in a cab and brought me to her, immediately ordered a samovar and washed and cleaned me herself in her kitchen. In the kitchen, she told me loudly that at half past eleven Katerina Nikolaevna herself would come to her - as they had both agreed just now - to meet with me. That's when Mary heard it. A few minutes later she brought the samovar, and two minutes later, when Tatyana Pavlovna suddenly called her name, she did not answer: it turned out that she had gone out for some reason. This I ask the reader to notice very much; it was then, I believe, a quarter to ten o'clock. Although Tatyana Pavlovna was angry at her disappearance without asking, she only thought that she had gone into the shop, and immediately forgot about it for the time being. Yes, and not before we were; we talked incessantly, because there was something to talk about, so that, for example, I hardly paid any attention to the disappearance of Marya; I ask the reader to remember this.","Mrs. Prutkov pushed me into a cab, took me to her place, ordered her Finnish maid to light the samovar, took me to her kitchen, and herself scrubbed my face and brushed my clothes. In the kitchen, she announced loudly that Katerina would be there at eleven-thirty to meet me, as the two of them had agreed. Maria, the maid, overheard that and a few minutes later brought in the samovar. But, when a little later Mrs. Prutkov called her, the Finn didn't answer: it turned out she'd gone out for some reason. The maid's failure to answer is important; the reader must remember it. It happened, I believe, at quarter to ten. Mrs. Prutkov, although irritated at the maid's silence, decided she must have gone out to buy something and forgot all about her. Besides, she had other things on her mind since we kept talking all the time with all we had to say to each other. I, for my part, hardly paid any attention at all to Maria's absence (reader, please note this too).","Tatyana Pavlovna pounced on me, put me in a sledge, and took me home with her, she immediately ordered the samovar, and washed and brushed me herself in the kitchen.

A few minutes later she brought in the samovar, and two minutes later, when Tatyana Pavlovna called her, she did not answer; it appeared that she had gone out for something. I beg the reader to make special note of this; it was about a quarter to ten I believe. Though Tatyana Pavlovna was angry at her disappearance without asking leave, she only thought she had gone out to the shop, and immediately forgot about it. And, indeed, we had no thoughts to spare for it, we talked away without ceasing, for we had plenty to talk about, so that I, at least, scarcely noticed Marya's disappearance; I beg the reader to make a note of that."

"Наутро я постарался встать как можно раньше. Обыкновенно у нас поднимались около восьми часов, то есть я, мать и сестра; Версилов нежился до половины десятого. Аккуратно в половине девятого мать приносила мне кофей. Но на этот раз я, не дождавшись кофею, улизнул из дому ровно в восемь часов. У меня еще с вечера составился общий план действий на весь этот день. В этом плане, несмотря на страстную решимость немедленно приступить к выполнению, я уже чувствовал, было чрезвычайно много нетвердого и неопределенного в самых важных пунктах; вот почему почти всю ночь я был как в полусне, точно бредил, видел ужасно много снов и почти ни разу не заснул как следует. Несмотря на то, поднялся бодрее и свежее, чем когда-нибудь. С матерью же я особенно не хотел повстречаться. Я не мог заговорить с нею иначе как на известную тему и боялся отвлечь себя от предпринятых целей каким-нибудь новым и неожиданным впечатлением.","In the morning I tried to get up as early as possible. We usually got up at about eight o'clock, that is, I, mother and sister; Versilov basked until half-past ten. Accurately at half past eight, my mother brought me coffee. But this time, without waiting for coffee, I sneaked out of the house at exactly eight o'clock. I had a general plan of action for the whole day since the evening. In this regard, in spite of the passionate determination to immediately begin implementation, I already felt that there was an extremely large amount of inconsistency and indeterminacy in the most important points; which is why I was half asleep most of the night, as if delirious, had an awful lot of dreams, and almost never fell asleep properly. Despite having risen more vigorously and fresher than ever. I didn't particularly want to meet my mother. I could not speak to her except on a certain topic, and was afraid to divert myself from the goals I had undertaken by some new and unexpected impression.","The following morning I got up as early as I could. Usually we— that is, my mother, my sister, and I—would get up around eight, while Versilov lingered in bed until half past nine or so. Punctually at eight-thirty, my mother would bring my breakfast up to my room. But this morning I didn't wait for it and slipped out of the house before eight. I had prepared a plan of action for the day. But despite my eagerness to go ahead with my plan, I was aware that many important points in it were still unclear in my mind; and this uncertainty had caused me to spend the night in a state halfway between sleep and wakefulness, thinking, losing the train of my thought, slipping into innumerable dreams, and never succeeding in sinking deeper into proper sleep for any length of time. In the morning, however, I felt more refreshed and energetic than ever. I was particularly anxious to avoid meeting Mother. I knew that if I saw her, I'd have to talk to her on a certain subject, and I was afraid that that conversation might somehow spoil my mood and divert me from the goals I had now set for myself.","I tried to get up as early as possible in the morning. As a rule we, that is my mother, my sister and I, used to get up about eight o'clock. Versilov used to lie comfortably in bed till half-past nine. Punctually at half-past eight my mother used to bring me up my coffee. But this time I slipped out of the house at eight o'clock without waiting for it. I had the day before mapped out roughly my plan of action for the whole of this day. In spite of my passionate resolve to carry out this plan I felt that there was a very great deal of it that was uncertain and indefinite in its most essential points. That was why I lay all night in a sort of half-waking state; I had an immense number of dreams, as though I were light-headed, and I hardly fell asleep properly all night. In spite of that I got up feeling fresher and more confident than usual. I was particularly anxious not to meet my mother. I could not have avoided speaking to her on a certain subject, and I was afraid of being distracted from the objects I was pursuing by some new and unexpected impression."
"Я обещал ему, что помолюсь, чувствуя, что обещанием этим доставлю ему чрезмерное удовольствие. И действительно, радость засияла в его лице; но спешу прибавить, что в подобных случаях он никогда не относился ко мне свысока, то есть вроде как бы старец к какому-нибудь подростку; напротив, весьма часто любил самого меня слушать, даже заслушивался, на разные темы, полагая, что имеет дело, хоть и с «вьюношем», как он выражался в высоком слоге (он очень хорошо знал, что надо выговаривать «юноша», а не «вьюнош»), но понимая вместе и то, что этот «вьюнош» безмерно выше его по образованию. Любил он, например, очень часто говорить о пустынножительстве и ставил «пустыню» несравненно выше «странствий». Я горячо возражал ему, напирая на эгоизм этих людей, бросающих мир и пользу, которую бы могли принести человечеству, единственно для эгоистической идеи своего спасения. Он сначала не понимал, подозреваю даже, что и совсем не понял; но пустыню очень защищал: «Сначала жалко себя, конечно (то есть когда поселишься в пустыне), – ну а потом каждый день все больше радуешься, а потом уже и Бога узришь». Тут я развил перед ним полную картину полезной деятельности ученого, медика или вообще друга человечества в мире и привел его в сущий восторг, потому что и сам говорил горячо; он поминутно поддакивал мне: «Так, милый, так, благослови тебя Бог, по истине мыслишь»; но когда я кончил, он все-таки не совсем согласился: «Так-то оно так, – вздохнул он глубоко, – да много ли таких, что выдержат и не развлекутся? Деньги хоть не Бог, а все же полбога – великое искушение; а тут и женский пол, а тут и самомнение и зависть. Вот дело-то великое и забудут, а займутся маленьким. То ли в пустыне? В пустыне человек укрепляет себя даже на всякий подвиг. Друг! Да и что в мире? – воскликнул он с чрезмерным чувством. – Не одна ли токмо мечта? Возьми песочку да посей на камушке; когда желт песочек у тебя на камушке том взойдет, тогда и мечта твоя в мире сбудется, – вот как у нас говорится. То ли у Христа: „Поди и раздай твое богатство и стань всем слуга“. И станешь богат паче прежнего в бессчетно раз; ибо не пищею только, не платьями ценными, не гордостью и не завистью счастлив будешь, а умножившеюся бессчетно любовью. Уж не малое богатство, не сто тысяч, не миллион, а целый мир приобретешь! Ныне без сытости собираем и с безумием расточаем, а тогда не будет ни сирот, ни нищих, ибо все мои, все родные, всех приобрел, всех до единого купил! Ныне не в редкость, что и самый богатый и знатный к числу дней своих равнодушен, и сам уж не знает, какую забаву выдумать; тогда же дни и часы твои умножатся как бы в тысячу раз, ибо ни единой минутки потерять не захочешь, а каждую в веселии сердца ощутишь. Тогда и премудрость приобретешь не из единых книг токмо, а будешь с самим Богом лицом к лицу; и воссияет земля паче солнца, и не будет ни печали, ни воздыхания, а лишь единый бесценный рай…»","I promised him that I would pray, feeling that with this promise I would give him excessive pleasure. Indeed, joy shone in his face; but I hasten to add that in such cases he never treated me haughtily, that is, like an old man to some teenager; on the contrary, he very often liked to listen to me himself, even listened to me, on various topics, believing that he was dealing, albeit with a “young man,” as he expressed it in a high style (he knew very well that one should pronounce “young man”, and not ""Vyunosh""), but understanding at the same time that this ""Vyunosh"" is immeasurably higher than his education. He liked, for example, very often to talk about hermitage and put ""desert"" incomparably higher than ""wanderings."" I objected ardently to him, pointing out the selfishness of these people, who give up the world and the good that they could bring to mankind, solely for the selfish idea of their salvation. He did not understand at first, I suspect that he did not understand at all; but he defended the desert very much: “At first you feel sorry for yourself, of course (that is, when you settle in the desert), - well, then every day you rejoice more and more, and then you will see God.” Here I developed before him a complete picture of the useful activity of a scientist, a physician, or in general a friend of mankind in the world, and brought him into sheer delight, because I myself spoke passionately; he continually assented to me: “So, dear, so, God bless you, you think in truth”; but when I finished, he still did not quite agree: “That’s how it is,” he sighed deeply, “but how many of them can endure and not have fun? Money though not God, but still half a god is a great temptation; and here is the female sex, and here is self-conceit and envy. Here is something great and they will forget, and they will take care of the small. Is it in the desert? In the wilderness, a person strengthens himself even for every feat. Friend! And what in the world? he exclaimed with excessive feeling. - Isn't it just a dream? Take sand and sow on a pebble; when the yellow sand rises on your pebble, then your dream will come true in the world - that's how we say. Or in Christ: ""Go and distribute your wealth and become a servant to everyone."" And you will become richer than before in countless times; for you will be happy not only with food, not with valuable dresses, not with pride and envy, but with love that has multiplied innumerably. You will gain not a small wealth, not a hundred thousand, not a million, but the whole world! Now we collect without satiety and squander with madness, and then there will be no orphans, no beggars, for all of mine, all relatives, I have acquired everyone, bought every single one! Nowadays it is not uncommon that even the richest and noblest is indifferent to the number of his days, and he himself no longer knows what kind of fun to invent; then your days and hours will be multiplied, as it were, a thousand times, for you will not want to lose a single minute, but you will feel each one in the joy of your heart. Then you will acquire wisdom not only from single books, but you will be face to face with God Himself; and the earth will shine brighter than the sun, and there will be no sorrow, no sighing, but only one priceless paradise ... ""","I promised him I'd pray, feeling this would please him. And, indeed, he beamed with pleasure. But I hasten to note that he never spoke in a lecturing tone, never sounded like a sage talking to an immature youth. Not in the least. In fact, he was interested in what I had to say and at times listened eagerly as I held forth on all sorts of subjects; for, although I was just a ""young'un"" (as he said even though he was perfectly aware that the proper word was ""youth""), he always remembered that this particular ""young'un"" was incomparably better educated than himself. One thing he was very fond of talking about was ""life in the wilderness,"" for to him living all alone in the wild was far superior to wandering around the country. I hotly disagreed, arguing that hermits were really egoists who had fled their worldly responsibilities and, instead of trying to be useful to their fellow men, selfishly sought only their own salvation. At first he couldn't see what I meant; indeed, I suspect he didn't understand what I was talking about and he just went on defending the advantages of being a hermit. ""Of course,"" he said, ""at first you feel sorry for yourself in being all alone, I mean in the beginning. But with every day that goes by, you're more and more pleased you're alone, and in the end you feel you're in the presence of God."" Then I drew for him as complete a picture as I could of all the useful things a learned man, a doctor, or anyone devoting his life to the service of mankind could, accomplish. I spoke with such eloquence that he became quite enthusiastic and repeatedly expressed his approval: "" That's right, my boy, God bless you, it's great the way you can understand these things!"" When I finished, though, he still didn't seem quite convinced. ""That's all very well,"" he said, dragging out his words and sighing deeply, but how many people are there who'd stick to their duties without going astray? A man may not look upon money as his god, but money can easily become a kind of half-god and is so often a mighty temptation. And then there're other temptations: women and vanity and envy. So a man may forget the great cause and try to satisfy all these little cravings. But when he's alone in the wild, it's different, for there he can harden himself and be ready for any sacrifice. Besides, my dear boy, what is there in man's world?"" he said with intense feeling. ""Isn't it just a dream? It's as if men were trying to sow by spreading sand on rocky ground; only when the yellow sand sprouts will that dream of theirs come true. We have a saying like that in our part of the country. What Christ said was, 'Go and give all you have to the poor and become the servant of all men,' for if you do you'll become a thousand times richer because your happiness won't be made just of good food, rich clothes, satisfied vanity, and appeased envy; instead, it will be built on love, love multiplied by love without end. And then you will gain not just riches, not just hundreds of thousands or a million, but it will be the whole world that you will gainl Today we amass material things without ever satisfying our greed and then we madly squander all we have amassed. But a day will come when there will be no orphans, no beggars, everyone will be like one of my own family, everyone will be my brother, and that is when I will have gained everything and everyone! Today even some of the richest and mightiest of men care nothing about how long they have been given to live because they too can no longer think up ways to spend their hours; but one day man's hours will be multiplied a thousandfold, for he will not want to lose one single moment of his life as he will live every one of them in the gaiety of his heart. And then his wisdom will come not out of books but from living in the presence of God, and our Earth will glow brighter than the sun and there will be no sadness, no sighs will be heard, and the whole world will be paradise.""","I promised him I would pray, feeling that I was giving him immense pleasure by this promise. And his face did, in fact, beam with joy; but I hasten to add that in such cases he did not take up a superior attitude to me, as a monk speaking to a raw youth; on the contrary, he very often liked listening to me. He was never weary in fact of hearing me talk on various subjects, realizing that though a ""youth"" I was immeasurably superior to him in education. He was very fond, for instance, of talking of the life of hermits in the desert, and thought of the ""desert"" as something far above ""pilgrimage. "" I hotly opposed him, laying stress on the egoism of these people, who had abandoned the world and all the services they might have rendered mankind, simply with the egoistic idea of their own salvation. At first he didn't quite understand; I suspect, indeed, he didn't understand at all, but he zealously defended the ""desert."" ""At first, of course, one grieves (that is when first one goes to dwell in the desert), but then each day one is more glad at heart, and at last one looks upon the face of God."" Then I drew a picture to him of the useful activity in the world of the man of science, the doctor, or any friend of humanity, and roused him to real enthusiasm, for I spoke with warmth; he kept eagerly assenting to my words, ""That's so, dear, that's so! God bless you, your thoughts are true."" But when I had finished he did not seem to agree entirely. ""To be sure, to be sure,"" he sighed deeply, ""but are there many who hold fast and are not led astray? Though money be not their God, yet it is a demi-god—a great temptation, and then there's the female sex, and then doubt and envy. And so they will forget their great work, and will be absorbed in little things. But in the desert a man strengthens himself for every great deed. My dear, what is there in the world?"" he exclaimed with intense feeling. "" But is it only a dream? Take a grain of sand and sow it on a stone; when that yellow grain of sand of yours on the stone springs up, then your dream will come true in the world. That's a saying of ours. Very different from Christ's 'Go and give all that thou hast to the poor and become the servant of all.' Then thou wilt be a thousandfold richer than ever before; for not by bread alone, not by rich garments, not by pride, not by envy, wilt thou be happy, but by love multiplied immeasurably. Not a little riches, not a hundred-thousand, not a million, but the whole world wilt thou gain! Now we gather and have not enough and squander senselessly, but then there will be no orphans nor beggars , for all will be my people, all will be akin. I have gained all, I have bought all, every one! Now it is no uncommon thing for the rich and powerful to care nothing for the length of their days, and to be at a loss to invent a pastime; then thy days and thy hours will be multiplied a thousandfold, for thou wilt grudge the loss of a single minute, and wilt rejoice in every minute in gaiety of heart. Then thou wilt attain wisdom, not from books alone, but wilt be face to face with God Himself; and the earth will shine more brightly than the sun, and there shall be no more sorrow nor sighing, nothing but one priceless Paradise… ."""

"В том-то и «идея» моя, в том-то и сила ее, что деньги – это единственный путь, который приводит на первое место даже ничтожество. Я, может быть, и не ничтожество, но я, например, знаю, по зеркалу, что моя наружность мне вредит, потому что лицо мое ординарно. Но будь я богат, как Ротшильд, – кто будет справляться с лицом моим и не тысячи ли женщин, только свистни, налетят ко мне с своими красотами? Я даже уверен, что они сами, совершенно искренно, станут считать меня под конец красавцем. Я, может быть, и умен. Но будь я семи пядей во лбу, непременно тут же найдется в обществе человек в восемь пядей во лбу – и я погиб. Между тем, будь я Ротшильдом, разве этот умник в восемь пядей будет что-нибудь подле меня значить? Да ему и говорить не дадут подле меня! Я, может быть, остроумен; но вот подле меня Талейран, Пирон – и я затемнен, а чуть я Ротшильд – где Пирон, да может быть, где и Талейран? Деньги, конечно, есть деспотическое могущество, но в то же время и высочайшее равенство, и в этом вся главная их сила. Деньги сравнивают все неравенства. Все это я решил еще в Москве.","That is my “idea”, that is its strength, that money is the only way that brings even a nonentity to the first place. I may not be a nonentity, but, for example, I know from a mirror that my appearance harms me, because my face is ordinary. But if I were rich, like Rothschild, who would cope with my face, and wouldn't thousands of women, just whistle, fly to me with their beauties? I am even sure that they themselves, quite sincerely, will consider me handsome in the end. I may be smart. But if I were seven spans in my forehead, there would certainly be in society a man with eight spans in my forehead - and I was lost. Meanwhile, if I were a Rothschild, would this eight-span wise guy mean anything beside me? And they won't let him talk next to me! I may be witty; but beside me Talleyrand, Piron - and I am darkened, and just a little I am Rothschild - where is Piron, and perhaps where is Talleyrand? Money, of course, is a despotic power, but at the same time it is the highest equality, and this is their main strength. Money compares all inequalities. I decided all this back in Moscow.","So the whole point of my ""idea"" is that money is the only road that can take a man to the top spot, the only force that can propel him there, even if he's a mediocrity. I, for instance, may not necessarily be a mediocrity, but when I look at my face in a mirror, I realize that my quite ordinary face is definitely a handicap. But if I were as rich as Rothschild, who would stop to look at my face? And if I just whistled, wouldn't thousands of women come rushing to offer me their charms? Indeed, I'm absolutely convinced that in the end they would sincerely think that I was the handsomest of men. I suppose I'm quite intelligent. But even if my brain power were ten times that of an average man, I'm sure there'd always be someone around whose brain power was eleven times the average, and what would become of me then? But if I were Rothschild, that fellow with the brain to the eleventh power would be no competition to me, for they wouldn't even give him a chance to open his mouth when I was around. I may be witty, but if a Talleyrand or a Piron[11] came along, my wit would appear dull in comparison with theirs. But if I were Rothschild, where would Piron or even Talleyrand be if they tried to outshine me? Money confers despotic power upon a man, but at the same time it is the greatest equalizer and that's where its main force lies: money eradicates all inequalities. I worked all that out while I was still in Moscow.","That is the point of my idea, that is the force of it, that money is the one means by which the humblest nonentity may rise to the FOREMOST PLACE. I may not be a nonentity, but I know from the looking-glass that my exterior does not do me justice, for my face is commonplace. But if I were as rich as Rothschild, who would find fault with my face? And wouldn't thousands of women be ready to fly to me with all their charms if I whistled to them? I am sure that they would honestly consider me good-looking. Suppose I am clever. But were I as wise as Solomon some one would be found wiser still, and I should be done for. But if I were a Rothschild what would that wise man be beside me? Why, they would not let him say a word beside me! I may be witty, but with Talleyrand or Piron I'm thrown into the shade; but if I were Rothschild, where would Piron be, and where Talleyrand even, perhaps? Money is, of course, despotic power, and at the same time it is the greatest leveller, and that is its chief power. Money levels all inequality. I settled all that in Moscow."

Сердце мое застучало.","- Well, if this beauty pays attention to him, despite the fact that he is so insignificant, stands in the corner and is angry because he is “small”, and suddenly prefers him to the whole crowd of admirers surrounding her, what then?

"Я кончил «идею». Если описал пошло, поверхностно – виноват я, а не «идея». Я уже предупредил, что простейшие идеи понимаются всех труднее; теперь прибавлю, что и излагаются труднее, тем более что я описывал «идею» еще в прежнем виде. Есть и обратный закон для идей: идеи пошлые, скорые – понимаются необыкновенно быстро, и непременно толпой, непременно всей улицей; мало того, считаются величайшими и гениальнейшими, но – лишь в день своего появления. Дешевое не прочно. Быстрое понимание – лишь признак пошлости понимаемого. Идея Бисмарка стала вмиг гениальною, а сам Бисмарк – гением; но именно подозрительна эта быстрота: я жду Бисмарка через десять лет, и увидим тогда, что останется от его идеи, а может быть, и от самого господина канцлера. Эту в высшей степени постороннюю и не подходящую к делу заметку я вставляю, конечно, не для сравнения, а тоже для памяти. (Разъяснение для слишком уж грубого читателя.)","I finished the idea. If I described it vulgarly, superficially, I am to blame, not the “idea”. I have already warned that the simplest ideas are the most difficult to understand; now I will add that it is more difficult to present it, especially since I have described the ""idea"" in its former form. There is also an inverse law for ideas: vulgar, fast ideas are understood unusually quickly, and certainly by the crowd, certainly by the whole street; not only are they considered the greatest and most brilliant, but only on the day of their appearance. Cheap is not durable. Quick understanding is only a sign of the vulgarity of what is being understood. Bismarck's idea became instantly brilliant, and Bismarck himself became a genius; but it is precisely this rapidity that is suspicious: I am waiting for Bismarck in ten years, and then we will see what remains of his idea, and perhaps even of the Chancellor himself. I insert this extremely extraneous and irrelevant note, of course, not for comparison, but also for memory. (An explanation for the overly rude reader.)","That's enough about my ""idea. "" If my explanation sounds commonplace und skimpy, the fault is not with my ""idea"" but with me. As I said earlier, the simpler an idea, the harder it is to grasp, and now I can add that the simpler an idea, the harder it also is to explain. What made it even harder for me was that I was trying to describe it in its original, primitive form. The corollary to that rule is that the more commonplace and ready-made ideas are, the more readily they are picked up, always by the whole populace, street by street, and the more quickly they are acclaimed as great, tremendous, and inspired, but these ideas only last a day. Cheap things don't last long and quick understanding by the crowd is a sign of cheapness. Bismarck's idea was at once acclaimed as a stroke of genius and Bismarck was hailed as a genius himself, and it's precisely that speed of recognition that makes me suspicious of the idea's true value. I'd like to defer judgment for ten years and see what's left of Bismarck's idea then or, for that matter, of Herr Chancellor himself. I've brought in this highly extraneous observation obviously not to suggest a comparison of ""ideas"" but simply for the record. (This explanation is for the particularly ignorant reader.)","I've finished with my idea. If my account of it has been commonplace and superficial it is I that am to blame and not the idea. I have already pointed out that the simplest ideas are always the most difficult to understand. Now I will add that they are also the most difficult to explain; moreover, I have described my ""idea"" in its earliest phase. The converse is the rule with ideas: commonplace and shallow ideas are extraordinarily quickly understood, and are invariably understood by the crowd, by the whole street. What is more, they are regarded as very great, and as the ideas of genius, but only for the day of their appearance. The cheap never wears. For a thing to be quickly understood is only a sign of its commonplaceness. Bismarck's idea was received as a stroke of genius instantly, and Bismarck himself was looked on as a genius, but the very rapidity of its reception was suspicious. Wait for ten years, and then we shall see what remains of the idea and of Bismarck himself. I introduce this extremely irrelevant observation, of course, not for the sake of comparison, but also for the sake of remembering it. (An explanation for the too unmannerly reader.)"

"Вы в этой мысли увидите, конечно, одно нахальство, насилие, торжество ничтожества над талантами. Согласен, что мысль эта дерзка (а потому сладостна). Но пусть, пусть: вы думаете, я желал тогда могущества, чтоб непременно давить, мстить? В том-то и дело, что так непременно поступила бы ординарность. Мало того, я уверен, что тысячи талантов и умников, столь возвышающихся, если б вдруг навалить на них ротшильдские миллионы, тут же не выдержали бы и поступили бы как самая пошлая ординарность и давили бы пуще всех. Моя идея не та. Я денег не боюсь; они меня не придавят и давить не заставят.","You will see in this thought, of course, one impudence, violence, the triumph of insignificance over talents. I agree that this idea is bold (and therefore sweet). But let it, let it: do you think I wanted power then, so that I would certainly crush, take revenge? The fact of the matter is that the ordinary would certainly do so. Moreover, I am sure that thousands of talented and smart people, who are so towering, if Rothschild millions were suddenly piled on them, they would immediately break down and act like the most vulgar ordinary and would put pressure on them more than anyone else. My idea is not the same. I'm not afraid of money; they won’t press me and they won’t force me to press.","You may see in this way of thinking just presumptuousness, a wish to impose oneself by force, a way for mediocrity to triumph over talent. I concede that my idea is presumptuous, but that's precisely what makes it so sweet to me. But do you really imagine that I thirst for power just to start throwing my weight around, to punish others for what I've had to bear? Why, that's the way a mediocrity would behave. Actually, I'm sure that thousands of talented and outstandingly clever people would crush everybody and smash everything in their way if they suddenly came into possession of Rothschild's millions, just like unimaginative mediocrities. But that's not true in my case: I'm not afraid of money—money will never crush me or force me to crush anybody.","You will see, of course, in this idea nothing but insolence, violence, the triumph of the nonentity over the talented. I admit that it is an impudent idea (and for that reason a sweet one). But let it pass: you imagine that I desire power to be able to crush, to avenge myself. That is just the point, that that is how the commonplace would behave. What is more, I'm convinced that thousands of the wise and talented who are so exalted, if the Rothschilds' millions suddenly fell to their lot could not resist behaving like the most vulgar and commonplace, and would be more oppressive than any. My idea is quite different. I'm not afraid of money. It won't crush me and it won't make me crush others."

Глава четвертая,Chapter Four,Chapter 4,Chapter 4
"День был чрезвычайно ясный; стору у Макара Ивановича не поднимали обыкновенно во весь день, по приказанию доктора; но на окне была не стора, а занавеска, так что самый верх окна был все-таки не закрыт; это потому, что старик тяготился, не видя совсем, при прежней сторе, солнца. И вот как раз мы досидели до того момента, когда солнечный луч вдруг прямо ударил в лицо Макара Ивановича. За разговором он не обратил сначала внимания, но машинально, во время речи, несколько раз отклонял в сторону голову, потому что яркий луч сильно беспокоил и раздражал его больные глаза. Мама, стоявшая подле него, уже несколько раз взглядывала на окно с беспокойством; просто надо бы было чем-нибудь заслонить окно совсем, но, чтоб не помешать разговору, она вздумала попробовать оттащить скамеечку, на которой сидел Макар Иванович, вправо в сторону: всего-то надо было подвинуть вершка на три, много на четверть. Она уже несколько раз наклонялась и схватывалась за скамейку, но оттащить не могла; скамейка, с сидящим на ней Макаром Ивановичем, не трогалась. Чувствуя ее усилия, но в жару разговора, совсем бессознательно, Макар Иванович несколько раз пробовал было приподняться, но ноги его не слушались. Мама, однако, все-таки продолжала напрягаться и дергать, и вот наконец все это ужасно озлило Лизу. Мне запомнилось несколько ее сверкающих, раздраженных взглядов, но только я, в первое мгновение, не знал, чему приписать их, да вдобавок был отвлечен разговором. И вот вдруг резко послышался ее почти окрик на Макара Ивановича:","The day was extremely clear; Makar Ivanovich's desk was usually not raised all day, by order of the doctor; but there was not a side on the window, but a curtain, so that the very top of the window was still not closed; this is because the old man was weary, not seeing the sun at all, with the old side. And just like that, we sat until the moment when a sunbeam suddenly hit Makar Ivanovich in the face. At first he did not pay attention to the conversation, but mechanically, during the speech, several times tilted his head to the side, because the bright beam greatly disturbed and irritated his sore eyes. Mama, who was standing beside him, had already glanced at the window several times with concern; it would simply have been necessary to block the window completely with something, but in order not to interfere with the conversation, she took it into her head to try to drag the stool on which Makar Ivanovich was sitting to the right side: all she had to do was move an inch three, maybe a quarter. She had already bent over and grabbed the bench several times, but could not pull it off; the bench, with Makar Ivanovich sitting on it, did not move. Feeling her efforts, but in the heat of the conversation, quite unconsciously, Makar Ivanovich tried several times to get up, but his legs would not obey. Mom, however, still continued to strain and pull, and finally all this terribly angered Lisa. I remember several of her sparkling, irritated glances, but I, at first, did not know what to attribute them to, and besides, I was distracted by the conversation. And suddenly she heard her almost shouting sharply at Makar Ivanovich:","It was an extremely bright day. The blind on the window in Makar's room, which had been kept down for many days on the doctor's orders, had been replaced by a curtain that did not extend all the way to the top of the window. This had been done because the old man had felt miserable not being able to see the sun at all. And now the moment had arrived when the sunbeam fell directly on Makar's face. He hadn't noticed it at first while he was speaking and had turned his head aside to avoid the glare that hurt his inflamed eyes. Mother, who stood next to him, kept casting worried glances at the window. The most obvious thing to do, of course, would have been to pull down the blind but, reluctant to interrupt the conversation, she tried instead to pull the bench on which Makar was sitting a little to the right—a mere matter of a few inches. Several times I noticed her bending down and tugging at the bench, but under Makar's weight it wouldn't budge. Apparently aware of her efforts but still continuing to talk, Makar made a few instinctive attempts to raise himself from the bench, but his legs wouldn't obey him. And so Mother went on trying to pull the bench out of the sun with him on it. In the end this provoked an annoyed outburst from Lisa. I vaguely remember having noticed a few of her irritated glances without understanding the reason for them. Besides, I was too absorbed in what was being said. And then suddenly I heard Lisa's shrill voice saying to Makar: ""Can't you raise yourself a bit, for heaven's sake!","It was a very bright day; by the doctor's orders Makar Ivanovitch's blind was as a rule not drawn up all day; but there was a curtain over the window now, instead of the blind, so that the upper part of the window was not covered; this was because the old man was miserable at not seeing the sun at all when he had the blind, and as we were sitting there the sun's rays fell suddenly full upon Makar Ivanovitch's face. At first, absorbed in conversation, he took no notice of it, but mechanically as he talked he several times turned his head on one side, because the bright sunlight hurt and irritated his bad eyes. Mother, standing beside him, glanced several times uneasily towards the window; all that was wanted was to screen the window completely with something, but to avoid interrupting the conversation she thought it better to try and move the bench on which Makar Ivanovitch was sitting a little to the right. It did not need to be moved more than six or at the most eight inches. She had bent down several times and taken hold of the bench, but could not move it; the bench with Makar Ivanovitch sitting on it would not move. Feeling her efforts unconsciously, in the heat of conversation, Makar Ivanovitch several times tried to get up, but his legs would not obey him. But mother went on straining all her strength to move it, and at last all this exasperated Liza horribly. I noticed several angry irritated looks from her, but for the first moment I did not know to what to ascribe them, besides I was carried away by the conversation. And I suddenly heard her almost shout sharply to Makar Ivanovitch:"
– Да ты врешь!..,"- Yes, you're lying! ..","Wait!""","""What nonsense you're talking."""
"Все это, конечно, я наговорил в какую-то как бы похвалу моей матери, а между тем уже заявил, что о ней, тогдашней, не знал вовсе. Мало того, я именно знаю всю непроходимость той среды и тех жалких понятий, в которых она зачерствела с детства и в которых осталась потом на всю жизнь. Тем не менее беда совершилась. Кстати, надо поправиться: улетев в облака, я забыл об факте, который, напротив, надо бы выставить прежде всего, а именно: началось у них прямо сбеды. (Я надеюсь, что читатель не до такой степени будет ломаться, чтоб не понять сразу, об чем я хочу сказать.) Одним словом, началось у них именно по-помещичьи, несмотря на то что была обойдена mademoiselle Сапожкова. Но тут уже я вступлюсь и заранее объявляю, что вовсе себе не противоречу. Ибо об чем, о Господи, об чем мог говорить в то время такой человек, как Версилов, с такою особою, как моя мать, даже и в случае самой неотразимой любви? Я слышал от развратных людей, что весьма часто мужчина, с женщиной сходясь, начинает совершенно молча, что, конечно, верх чудовищности и тошноты; тем не менее Версилов, если б и хотел, то не мог бы, кажется, иначе начать с моею матерью. Неужели же начать было объяснять ей «Полиньку Сакс»? Да и сверх того, им было вовсе не до русской литературы; напротив, по его же словам (он как-то раз расходился), они прятались по углам, поджидали друг друга на лестницах, отскакивали как мячики, с красными лицами, если кто проходил, и «тиран помещик» трепетал последней поломойки, несмотря на все свое крепостное право. Но хоть и по-помещичьи началось, а вышло так, да не так, и, в сущности, все-таки ничего объяснить нельзя. Даже мраку больше. Уж одни размеры, в которые развилась их любовь, составляют загадку, потому что первое условие таких, как Версилов, – это тотчас же бросить, если достигнута цель. Не то, однако же, вышло. Согрешить с миловидной дворовой вертушкой (а моя мать не была вертушкой) развратному «молодому щенку» (а они были все развратны, все до единого – и прогрессисты и ретрограды) – не только возможно, но и неминуемо, особенно взяв романическое его положение молодого вдовца и его бездельничанье. Но полюбить на всю жизнь – это слишком. Не ручаюсь, что он любил ее, но что он таскал ее за собою всю жизнь – это верно.","All this, of course, I said in some kind of praise of my mother, but meanwhile I already declared that I did not know at all about her then. Moreover, I know exactly how impenetrable that environment and those miserable concepts in which she became stale from childhood and in which she later remained for the rest of her life. However, the trouble happened. By the way, I need to get better: having flown into the clouds, I forgot about the fact, which, on the contrary, should be put forward first of all, namely: they started to have a real trouble. (I hope that the reader will not break down to such an extent that he does not immediately understand what I want to say.) In a word, they began in the landowner's way, despite the fact that Mademoiselle Sapozhkova was bypassed. But here I will intervene and announce in advance that I do not contradict myself at all. For what, O Lord, could such a person as Versilov talk about at that time with such a special person as my mother, even in the case of the most irresistible love? I have heard from depraved people that very often a man, on meeting a woman, begins in complete silence, which, of course, is the height of monstrosity and nausea; nevertheless, Versilov, even if he wanted to, he could not, it seems, have begun otherwise with my mother. Was it really possible to begin to explain to her ""Polinka Sachs""? And besides, they had no time for Russian literature at all; on the contrary, in his own words (he once parted ways), they hid in the corners, waited for each other on the stairs, bounced off like balls, with red faces, if anyone passed, and the “tyrant landowner” trembled at the last scrubber, despite all his serfdom. But although it began in a landowner's way, it turned out like this, but not like that, and, in essence, nothing can be explained. Even more darkness. Already the dimensions into which their love has developed are a mystery, because the first condition of such as Versilov is to quit immediately if the goal is achieved. Not that, however, it turned out. To sin with a pretty yard turntable (and my mother was not a turntable) to a depraved ""young puppy"" (and they were all depraved, every single one - both progressives and retrogrades) - is not only possible, but also inevitable, especially taking his romantic position as a young widower and his idleness. But falling in love for life is too much. I can't vouch that he loved her, but that he dragged her along with him all his life - that's true.","It may look as if I've written all this to defend my mother's reputation, which may seem strange since, as I said before, I knew nothing whatsoever of her as she was then. Besides, I was well aware of the hopeless confinement of her early childhood and the degrading notions in which she had been steeped and which clung to her all her life. Still, the fact must be recognized—the disgraceful thing did happen. But I must put something straight. I have let my feelings run away with me and have left out something that should have been mentioned first, namely, that it all started with the disgrace. (I hope the reader won't be so hypocritical as to pretend he can't imagine what I mean by disgrace.) Yes, although Miss Sapozhkov was passed over, it all began from Versilov's use of his droit de seigneur. But here I'll stand up for myself and insist that there's no inconsistency in what I say. Because what could a man like Versilov possibly have to say to a girl like my mother, even if he had felt an overpowering love for her? I've heard depraved people say that men and women may just meet and start the whole thing in complete silence, which, of course, I consider an unspeakable monstrosity. Nevertheless, I can't see how else Versilov could've started with my mother, even if he had wanted to. Could one imagine him starting with a literary analysis of Polinka Sachs? As a matter of fact, they had much more urgent things to worry about than excursions into Russian literature. From what I gathered from Versilov directly when he let himself go once, they used to hide in corners, wait for each other on the stairs, bounce away from each other red-faced when someone went by; and many a time the ""tyrannical landowner"" would tremble at the sight of any lowly servant scrubbing the floors despite all his seignorial rights! But, although it all started as the usual thing for a landowner, it was that and yet not really that, and after all I have said I see that I can't explain anything at all. In fact, it seems even more mysterious now. Just the length of their affair is quite puzzling because, with men like Versilov, the rule is to discard the object as soon as the objective has been attained. But that was not what happened. To sin with a pretty, playful serf girl (my mother was not playful) was not only natural but well-nigh inevitable for a depraved ""young dog"" (and every landowner was depraved, whether liberal or reactionary), particularly in Versilov's case with the idle life he led and the romantic figure he cut as a young widower and all that. But to love someone for life—that was too much. So, while I cannot guarantee that he loved her, it is a fact that he has been dragging her along with him ever since.","I have said all this, of course, as it were to the credit of my mother. But I have explained already that I knew nothing whatever of her as she was then. What is more, I know the rigidity of her environment, and the pitiful ideas in which she had become set from her childhood and to which she remained enslaved for the rest of her life. The misfortune happened, nevertheless. I must correct myself, by the way. Letting my fancy run away with me, I have forgotten the fact which I ought to have stated first of all, that is, that the misfortune happened at the very outset (I hope that the reader will not be too squeamish to understand at once what I mean). In fact, it began with his exercising his seignorial rights, although Mlle. Sapozhkov was passed over. But here, in self-defence, I must declare at once that I am not contradicting myself. For—good Lord!—what could a man like Versilov have talked about at that date with a person like my mother even if he had felt the most overwhelming love for her? I have heard from depraved people that men and women very often come together without a word being uttered, which is, of course, the last extreme of monstrous loathsomeness. Nevertheless, I do not see how Versilov could have begun differently with my mother if he had wanted to. Could he have begun by expounding ""Polinka Sachs"" to her? And besides, they had no thoughts to spare for Russian literature; on the contrary, from what he said (he let himself go once), they used to hide in corners, wait for each other on the stairs, fly apart like bouncing balls, with flushed cheeks if anyone passed by, and the ""tyrant slave-owner"" trembled before the lowest scrubbing-maid, in spite of his seignorial rights. And although it was at first an affair of master and servant, it was that and yet not that, and after all, there is no really explaining it. In fact, the more you go into it the more obscure it seems. The very depth and duration of their love makes it more mysterious , for it is a leading characteristic of such men as Versilov to abandon as soon as their object is attained. That did not happen, though. To transgress with an attractive, giddy flirt who was his serf (and my mother was not a flirt) was not only possible but inevitable for a depraved young puppy (and they were all depraved, every one of them, the progressives as well as the reactionaries), especially considering his romantic position as a young widower and his having nothing to do. But to love her all his life is too much. I cannot guarantee that he did love her, but he has dragged her about with him all his life—that's certain."

Чтоб удобнее обдумать, я прилег на постель Васина так, как был, одетый и в сапогах, на минутку, совсем без намерения спать – и вдруг заснул, даже не помню, как и случилось.

To think things over more comfortably, I lay down on Vasin's bed. I was dressed, boots and all, and intended to lie down just for a few minutes. But, without knowing when it happened, I fell asleep. I slept for four hours. Nobody waked me.","He broke off and frowned disagreeably. At seven o'clock he went out again; he still had a great deal to do. I was left at last entirely alone.

"Я проснулся утром часов в восемь, мигом запер мою дверь, сел к окну и стал думать. Так просидел до десяти часов. Служанка два раза стучалась ко мне, но я прогонял ее. Наконец, уже в одиннадцатом часу, опять постучались. Я было закричал опять, но это была Лиза. С нею вошла и служанка, принесла мне кофей и расположилась затоплять печку. Прогнать служанку было невозможно, и все время, пока Фекла накладывала дров и раздувала огонь, я все ходил большими шагами по моей маленькой комнате, не начиная разговора и даже стараясь не глядеть на Лизу.

"Правда, несмотря на обожание Катерины Николаевны, в нем всегда коренилось самое искреннее и глубочайшее неверие в ее нравственные достоинства. Я наверно думаю, что он так и ждал тогда за дверью ее унижения перед Ламбертом. Но хотел ли он того, если даже и ждал? Опять-таки повторяю: я твердо верю, что он ничего не хотел и даже не рассуждал. Ему просто хотелось быть тут, выскочить потом, сказать ей что-нибудь, а может быть – может быть, и оскорбить, может быть, и убить ее… Все могло случиться тогда; но только, придя с Ламбертом, он ничего не знал из того, что случится. Прибавлю, что револьвер был Ламбертов, а сам он пришел безоружный. Увидя же ее гордое достоинство, а главное, не стерпев подлеца Ламберта, грозившего ей, он выскочил – и уж затем потерял рассудок. Хотел ли он ее застрелить в то мгновение? По-моему, сам не знал того, но наверно бы застрелил, если б мы не оттолкнули его руку.","True, despite the adoration of Katerina Nikolaevna, the most sincere and deepest disbelief in her moral virtues was always rooted in him. I probably think that he was just waiting outside the door for her humiliation before Lambert. But did he want it, even if he expected it? Again, I repeat: I firmly believe that he did not want anything and did not even reason. He just wanted to be there, jump out later, tell her something, and maybe - maybe insult her, maybe kill her ... Everything could happen then; but only, having come with Lambert, he knew nothing of what would happen. I will add that the revolver was Lambertov, and he himself came unarmed. Seeing her proud dignity, and most importantly, unable to endure the scoundrel Lambert, who threatened her, he jumped out - and only then lost his mind. Did he want to shoot her at that moment? I don't think he knew it himself, but he probably would have shot him if we hadn't pushed his hand away.","It is a fact that, for all his passion lor Katerina, Versilov had always been highly skeptical of her moral qualities. I'm convinced that, while he was standing in the passage during her exchange with Lambert, he fully expected her to accept Lambert's disgraceful demands. But did he want her to accept them? As I said, I'm convinced he wanted nothing, he wasn't even thinking: he just felt he had to be there, perhaps to leap out of hiding, say something to her, maybe insult her, and perhaps . . . perhaps kill her. Anything could happen, but when he first arrived in Lambert's company he had no idea of what it was going to be. I also want to emphasize the fact that the gun belonged to Lambert while Versilov himself came unarmed. It was when he saw her dignified pride in the face of Lambert's insulting threats that he couldn't restrain himself and rushed in. It was only after that that he ran amok. Did he really want to shoot her at that moment? I don't believe he knew himself, but I suppose he'd have shot her if we hadn't interfered.","It is true that in spite of his adoration for Katerina Nikolaevna, he had a deep-rooted and perfectly genuine disbelief in her moral qualities. I really believe that he waited outside the door then, to see her humiliated before Lambert. But did he desire it, if even he waited for it? Again I repeat: I firmly believe that he had no desire, no intention even. He simply wanted to be there, to rush in afterwards, to say something, perhaps to insult, perhaps even to kill her… . Anything might happen then; but when he came with Lambert he had no idea what would happen. I may add that the revolver was Lambert's and that he himself came unarmed. Seeing her proud dignity, and above all, exasperated by Lambert's blackguardliness in threatening her, he dashed in—and only then went mad. Did he mean to shoot her at that instant? In my opinion he did not know what he was doing, but he certainly would have shot her if we had not thrust aside his hand."
"– Ах да, – произнес он голосом светского человека, и как бы вдруг припомнив, – ах да! Тот вечер… Я слышал… Ну как ваше здоровье и как вы теперь сами после всего этого, Аркадий Макарович?.. Но, однако, перейдем к главному. Я, видите ли, собственно преследую три цели; три задачи передо мной, и я…","“Ah, yes,” he said in the voice of a man of the world, and as if suddenly remembering, “oh, yes!” That evening ... I heard ... Well, how is your health and how are you now after all this, Arkady Makarovich? .. But, however, let's move on to the main thing. I, you see, actually pursue three goals; three tasks in front of me, and I ...","""Ah, yes, of course,"" he said, turning at once into a gentleman of the best society trying to remember something that had slipped his mind.

"Вот человек, однако! Я говорю про Версилова. Он, он только и был всему причиной – и что же: на него одного я тогда не злился. Не одна его манера со мной меня подкупила. Я думаю, мы тогда взаимно почувствовали, что обязаны друг другу многими объяснениями… и что именно потому всего лучше никогда не объясняться. Чрезвычайно приятно, когда в подобных положениях жизни натолкнешься на умного человека! Я уже сообщал во второй части моего рассказа, забегая вперед, что он очень кратко и ясно передал мне о письме ко мне арестованного князя, о Зерщикове, о его объяснении в мою пользу и проч., и проч. Так как я решился молчать, то сделал ему, со всею сухостью, лишь два-три самых кратких вопроса; он ответил на них ясно и точно, но совершенно без лишних слов и, что всего лучше, без лишних чувств. Лишних-то чувств я тогда и боялся.","Here's a man though! I'm talking about Versilov. He, he was the only reason for everything - and what: I wasn’t angry at him alone then. Not only his manner with me bribed me. I think we then mutually felt that we owe each other many explanations ... and that it is precisely for this reason that it is best never to explain. It is extremely pleasant when in such situations of life you come across an intelligent person! I already reported in the second part of my story, looking ahead, that he very briefly and clearly conveyed to me about the letter to me from the arrested prince, about Zershchikov, about his explanation in my favor, and so on and so forth. Since I decided to keep silent, I asked him, with all dryness, only two or three of the most brief questions; he answered them clearly and precisely, but completely without superfluous words and, best of all, without superfluous feelings. I was afraid of superfluous feelings then.","Ah, what a man! I'm talking of Versilov. He was the one who was responsible for everything that had happened to me, but somehow I didn't feel resentful toward him. And it was not just the way he treated me that won me over. I believe it was because at that point we both felt there were many things we should explain to each other . . . and because of that, the best course was for us never to explain anything. It's awfully pleasant at junctures in life such as the one I was going through to deal with an intelligent person! As I've already mentioned, Versilov had told me briefly about the letter to me from Sergei, who was now in jail, about Zershikov's rehabilitation of my honor, and all the rest. Since I had resolved not to talk, I only asked him a couple of very short questions that he answered clearly and precisely without one unnecessary word and, what was even more valuable, without injecting into his answers any unnecessary feeling. For it was unsolic-itated feelings that I was most afraid of.","He was a man, though! I am speaking of Versilov. He, he was the sole cause of it all, and, strange to say, he was the only one towards whom I did not feel resentful. It was not only his manner to me that won me over. I imagine that we felt at that time that we owed each other many explanations … and for that very reason it would be our best course never to explain. It's extremely pleasant in such situations to have to do with a man of intelligence: I have mentioned already, in the second part of my story, that he told me briefly and clearly of Prince Sergay's letter to me about Zerstchikov, about what he, Prince Sergay, had said to the latter, and so on. As I had made up my mind to keep quiet, I only asked him two or three brief questions; he answered them clearly and exactly but entirely without superfluous words and, what was best of all, without feeling. I was afraid of superfluous feeling at that time."
"Не могу выразить, как сжалось у меня сердце, когда я остался один: точно я отрезал живьем собственный кусок мяса! Для чего я так вдруг разозлился и для чего так обидел его – так усиленно и нарочно, – я бы не мог теперь рассказать, конечно и тогда тоже. И как он побледнел! И что же: эта бледность, может быть, была выражением самого искреннего и чистого чувства и самой глубокой горести, а не злости и не обиды. Мне всегда казалось, что бывали минуты, когда он очень любил меня. Почему, почему не верить мне теперь этому, тем более что уже так многое совершенно объяснено теперь?","I cannot express how my heart sank when I was left alone: it was as if I had cut off my own piece of meat alive! Why I suddenly got angry and why I offended him so intensely and on purpose - I could not tell now, of course, then too. And how pale he was! And what: this pallor, perhaps, was an expression of the most sincere and pure feeling and the deepest sorrow, and not anger and not resentment. It always seemed to me that there were moments when he loved me very much. Why, why not believe me now, especially since so much has already been completely explained now?","I cannot describe how my heart contracted when I was left alone in my room—it was as if I'd cut off a part of my living flesh! Why did I turn so vicious , why did I have to offend him so cruelly and calculatingly? I couldn't possibly explain it either then or even now. And he had turned so pale! Perhaps that paleness reflected the most sincere and the purest feelings, the deepest sorrow rather than anger aroused by my insults. I'd always thought there were moments when he really loved me. Why couldn't I believe it now, especially since so much of what I hadn't understood had become clear to me now?","I can't express how my heart ached when I was left alone; it was as though I had cut off a piece of my own living flesh! Why I had so suddenly lost my temper, and why I had so insulted him—so persistently and intentionally— I couldn't say now; nor could I at the time, of course. And how pale he had turned! And who knows, perhaps that paleness was the expression of the truest and purest feeling and the deepest sorrow, and not of anger or of offence. I always fancied that there had been a moment when he really loved me. Why, why could I not believe that now, especially when so much had been made clear?"
"– Да я, собственно, из чувства меры: не стоило такого треску, и нарушена была мера.

For a whole month he was silent, getting ready, and suddenly - nothing!","""It offends my sense of proportion: if that was all, you shouldn't have made such a production out of it.

Why should it bother me if people pushed me out of their way in the street or if I had to keep jumping aside into the gutter and just managed not to wind up under horses' hooves or carriage wheels? The knowledge that I was Rothschild would make even that experience pleasant. And I'd know that if I wanted, I'd be able to have a better dinner than anyone else that night because I had the best cook in the world, and the awareness of it would be enough for me. So if I ate just a ham sandwich, the knowledge of what I could have had if I chose to would satisfy my palate. I even feel this way now.","If I only have power, I argued, I should have no need to use it. I assure you that of my own free will I should take the lowest seat everywhere. If I were a Rothschild, I would go about in an old overcoat with an umbrella. What should I care if I were jostled in the crowd, if I had to skip through the mud to avoid being run over? The consciousness that I was myself, a Rothschild, would even amuse me at the moment. I should know I could have a dinner better than anyone, that I could have the best cook in the world, it would be enough for me to know it. I would eat a piece of bread and ham and be satisfied with the consciousness of it. I think so even now."

"И вдруг, помню, мне стало ужасно омерзительно вспоминать… и досадно и тошно, и на них и на себя. Я в чем-то упрекал себя и старался думать о другом. «Почему у меня нет ни малейшего негодования на Версилова за историю с соседкой?» – пришло мне вдруг в голову. С моей стороны, я твердо был убежден, что он сыграл тут любовную роль и приходил с тем, чтоб повеселиться, но собственно это не возмущало меня. Мне даже казалось, что иначе его и представить нельзя, и хоть я и в самом деле был рад, что его осрамили, но не винил его. Мне не то было важно; мне важно было то, что он так озлобленно посмотрел на меня, когда я вошел с соседкой, так посмотрел, как никогда. «Наконец-то и он посмотрел на меня серьезно!» – подумал я с замиранием сердца. О, если б я не любил его, я бы не обрадовался так его ненависти!","And suddenly, I remember, it became terribly disgusting to remember ... and annoying and sickening, both at them and at myself. I reproached myself for something and tried to think of something else. ""Why don't I have the slightest resentment against Versilov for the affair with my neighbor?"" - it suddenly occurred to me. For my part, I was firmly convinced that he played here a love role and came in order to have fun, but this did not really resent me. It even seemed to me that it was impossible to imagine him otherwise, and although I really was glad that he was shamed, I did not blame him. It didn't matter to me; What mattered to me was that he looked at me so angrily when I entered with a neighbor, he looked like never before. “Finally, he looked at me seriously!” I thought with a sinking heart. Oh, if I did not love him, I would not rejoice so much in his hatred!","Then suddenly I felt unbearably disgusted at trying to reconstruct the scene; I felt sick and angry, both with them and with myself. There was something wrong with me, I decided, and tried to think of something else. I suddenly thought: Why wasn't I in the least indignant with Versilov for the way he'd behaved with the girl next door? I was quite convinced that he'd gone to her intending to take advantage of her distress and have himself a good time. But it didn't arouse my indignation. I thought that no one could expect anything else of him and, although I was glad he'd been exposed and put to shame, I didn't feel in the least outraged. What bothered me was not what he'd tried to do but the way he'd looked at me with cold hatred when I'd come in with the girl. And, as nry heart missed a beat, I thought: ""Now, at last, he looks at me without affectation."" Ah, if I hadn't loved him, I wouldn't have been so overjoyed by his hatred!","And suddenly, I remember, I felt horribly disgusted at the recollection … and sick and angry both at them and at myself. I reproached myself and tried to think of something else. ""Why did I not feel the slightest indignation with Versilov for the incident with the girl in the next room? "" it suddenly occurred to me to wonder. For my part, I was firmly convinced that he had had amorous designs and had come to amuse himself, but I was not particularly indignant at this. It seemed to me, indeed, that one could not have conceived of his behaving differently, and although I really was glad he had been put to shame, yet I did not blame him. It was not that which seemed important to me; what was important was the exasperation with which he had looked at me when I came in with the girl, the way he had looked at me as he had never done before. ""At last he has looked at me SERIOUSLY,"" I thought, with a flutter at my heart. Ah, if I had not loved him I should not have been so overjoyed at his hatred!"

"О, прочь это низкое воспоминание! Проклятый сон! Клянусь, что до этого мерзостного сна не было в моем уме даже хоть чего-нибудь похожего на эту позорную мысль! Даже невольной какой-нибудь в этом роде мечты не было (хотя я и хранил «документ» зашитым в кармане и хватался иногда за карман с странной усмешкой). Откудова же это все явилось совсем готовое? Это оттого, что во мне была душа паука! Это значит, что все уже давно зародилось и лежало в развратном сердце моем, в желании моем лежало, но сердце еще стыдилось наяву, и ум не смел еще представить что-нибудь подобное сознательно. А во сне душа сама все представила и выложила, что было в сердце, в совершенной точности и в самой полной картине и – в пророческой форме. И неужели это я им хотел доказать, выбегая поутру от Макара Ивановича? Но довольно: до времени ничего об этом! Этот сон, мне приснившийся, есть одно из самых странных приключений моей жизни.","Oh, away with this low memory! Damn dream! I swear that before this vile dream there was not even anything like this shameful thought in my mind! There was not even an involuntary dream of this kind (although I kept the “document” sewn up in my pocket and sometimes clutched at my pocket with a strange smile). Where did all this come from, ready-made? It's because I had the soul of a spider in me! This means that everything was born long ago and lay in my depraved heart, lay in my desire, but my heart was still ashamed in reality, and my mind had not yet dared to imagine anything like that consciously. And in a dream, the soul itself presented everything and laid out what was in the heart, in perfect accuracy and in the most complete picture and - in a prophetic form. And is it really that I wanted to prove to them, running out in the morning from Makar Ivanovich? But enough: until the time, nothing about it! This dream I had is one of the strangest adventures of my life.","Oh, be gone, vile memory! Evil vision! I swear that, until I had that filthy dream, there was nothing on my mind even remotely connected with that disgraceful thought. I never even had any such unconscious wish (although I did keep the document sewn into the lining of my pocket and I sometimes touched that pocket with a peculiar little grin). So how could it have come to me, complete with all the details, as it did? The answer must be that I had the soul of a spider. All this must have been hatched long before and been stored in my perverted heart; it was all part of my desire, although my heart was still too ashamed of it during my waking hours and my brain still did not dare to formulate consciously anything of the sort. But, in my sleep, my soul had shown and explained exactly what was hidden inside me; it had given a complete, absolutely accurate picture and, what is more, in a prophetic form. And could it be that this was what I'd wanted to prove to them that morning when I'd rushed out of Makar's room? But enough of this for the time being. I'll only say that this dream is one of the strangest things that has happened to me in all my life.","Oh, away with that vile memory? Accursed dream! I swear that until that loathsome dream nothing like that shameful idea had ever been in my mind. There had never been even an unconscious dream of the sort (though I had kept the ""letter"" sewn up in my pocket, and I sometimes gripped my pocket with a strange smile). How was it all this came to me so complete? It was because I had the soul of a spider! It shows that all this had long ago been hatching in my corrupt heart, and lay latent in my desires, but my waking heart was still ashamed, and my mind dared not consciously picture anything of the sort. But in sleep the soul presented and laid bare all that was hidden in the heart, with the utmost accuracy, in a complete picture and in prophetic form. And was THAT what I had threatened to SHOW them, when I had run out of Makar Ivanovitch's room that morning? But enough: for the time no more of this! That dream is one of the strangest things that has happened in my life."

"Сделаю предисловие: читатель, может быть, ужаснется откровенности моей исповеди и простодушно спросит себя: как это не краснел сочинитель? Отвечу, я пишу не для издания; читателя же, вероятно, буду иметь разве через десять лет, когда все уже до такой степени обозначится, пройдет и докажется, что краснеть уж нечего будет. А потому, если я иногда обращаюсь в записках к читателю, то это только прием. Мой читатель – лицо фантастическое.","I will make a preface: the reader, perhaps, will be horrified by the frankness of my confession and ingenuously ask himself: how did the writer not blush? I will answer, I do not write for publication; I will probably only have a reader in ten years, when everything will have become so clear, will pass, and it will prove that there will be nothing to blush. And therefore, if I sometimes turn to the reader in notes, then this is only a device. My reader is a fantastic person.","The reader may be shocked at the frankness of my confession and wonder how I could write these things without blushing. The answer is that I'm not writing this for publication and do not expect anyone to read it before ten years or so, by which time everything will be viewed from a sufficient distance, will be settled, and my point adequately demonstrated, so there will no longer be anything for me to blush about. Therefore, if I address myself to the reader now and again, it's only a narrative device. My reader is a purely imaginary character.","Let me tell the reader, he will perhaps be horrified at the candour of my confession, and in the simplicity of his heart will wonder how the author could help blushing: but my answer is that I'm not writing for publication, and I may not have a reader for ten years, and by that time everything will be so thoroughly past, settled and defined that there will be no need to blush. And so, if I sometimes in my autobiography appeal to my reader it is simply a form of expression. My reader is an imaginary figure."

"Дергачев был среднего роста, широкоплеч, сильный брюнет с большой бородой; во взгляде его видна была сметливость и во всем сдержанность, некоторая беспрерывная осторожность; хоть он больше молчал, но очевидно управлял разговором. Физиономия Васина не очень поразила меня, хоть я слышал о нем как о чрезмерно умном: белокурый, с светло-серыми большими глазами, лицо очень открытое, но в то же время в нем что-то было как бы излишне твердое; предчувствовалось мало сообщительности, но взгляд решительно умный, умнее дергачевского, глубже, – умнее всех в комнате; впрочем, может быть, я теперь все преувеличиваю. Из остальных я припоминаю всего только два лица из всей этой молодежи: одного высокого смуглого человека, с черными бакенами, много говорившего, лет двадцати семи, какого-то учителя или вроде того, и еще молодого парня моих лет, в русской поддевке, – лицо со складкой, молчаливое, из прислушивающихся. Он и оказался потом из крестьян.","Dergachev was of medium height, broad-shouldered, strong-haired, with a large beard; sharpness and restraint in everything, a certain uninterrupted caution were visible in his look; although he was more silent, he obviously controlled the conversation. Vasin's physiognomy did not really strike me, although I had heard of him as excessively intelligent: fair-haired, with large light gray eyes, his face was very open, but at the same time there was something, as it were, excessively hard in it; little sociability was foreseen, but a decidedly intelligent look, smarter than Dergachev's, deeper, smarter than anyone in the room; However, I may be exaggerating now. Of the rest, I remember only two faces from all this youth: one tall, swarthy man, with black whiskers, who talked a lot, about twenty-seven, some kind of teacher or something like that, and another young guy of my age, in a Russian coat - a face wrinkled, silent, listening. He later turned out to be a peasant.","Dergachev was a dark-haired, bearded man of average height, powerfully built, and broad-shouldered. His eye was quick, his behavior reserved, and he seemed to be constantly on guard. Although he probably said less than the others, it was obvious that it was he who directed the conversation. Vasin's face didn't really strike me particularly, although he had the reputation of being a remarkably intelligent man. His hair was fair; his light gray eyes were large; his face seemed very open, although I felt that there was also something needlessly hard about it. One could guess that he was not a very communicative man, but I thought he did look extraordinarily intelligent, more intelligent than Dergachev, with a deeper and more penetrating intelligence than that of any person in the room. Besides these three, I can only remember two faces, one belonging to a tall twenty-seven-year-old man with black sideburns, a teacher or something, who spoke with great volubility, and a young fellow, my age perhaps, with a peculiar frown, who wore a Russian peasant's coat and mostly listened, saying little. And, as it turned out, he did come from a family of peasants.","Dergatchev was a strong, broad-shouldered, dark-complexioned man of medium height, with a big beard. His eyes showed acuteness, habitual reserve, and a certain incessant watchfulness; though he was for the most part silent, he evidently controlled the conversation. Vassin's face did not impress me much, though I had heard of him as extraordinarily intelligent: he had fair hair, large light grey eyes, and a very open face. But at the same time there was something, as it were, too hard in it; one had a presentiment that he would not be communicative, but he looked undeniably clever, cleverer than Dergatchev, of a more profound intellect—cleverer than anyone in the room. But perhaps I am exaggerating. Of the other young men I only recall two; one a tall, dark man of twenty-seven, with black whiskers, who talked a great deal, a teacher or something of the sort; the other was a fellow of my own age, with good lines in his face, wearing a Russian tunic without sleeves. He was silent, and listened attentively. He turned out afterwards to be a peasant."

"Незадолго до французской революции явился в Париже некто Лоу и затеял один, в принципе гениальный, проект (который потом на деле ужасно лопнул). Весь Париж взволновался; акции Лоу покупались нарасхват, до давки. В дом, в котором была открыта подписка, сыпались деньги со всего Парижа как из мешка; но и дома наконец недостало: публика толпилась на улице – всех званий, состояний, возрастов; буржуа, дворяне, дети их, графини, маркизы, публичные женщины – все сбилось в одну яростную, полусумасшедшую массу укушенных бешеной собакой; чины, предрассудки породы и гордости, даже честь и доброе имя – все стопталось в одной грязи; всем жертвовали (даже женщины), чтобы добыть несколько акций. Подписка перешла наконец на улицу, но негде было писать. Тут одному горбуну предложили уступить на время свой горб, в виде стола для подписки на нем акций. Горбун согласился – можно представить, за какую цену! Некоторое время спустя (очень малое) все обанкрутилось, все лопнуло, вся идея полетела к черту, и акции потеряли всякую цену. Кто ж выиграл? Один горбун, именно потому, что брал не акции, а наличные луидоры. Ну-с, я вот и есть тот самый горбун! У меня достало же силы не есть и из копеек скопить семьдесят два рубля; достанет и настолько, чтобы и в самом вихре горячки, всех охватившей, удержаться и предпочесть верные деньги большим. Я мелочен лишь в мелочах, но в великом – нет. На малое терпение у меня часто недоставало характера, даже и после зарождения «идеи», а на большое – всегда достанет. Когда мне мать подавала утром, перед тем как мне идти на службу, простылый кофей, я сердился и грубил ей, а между тем я был тот самый человек, который прожил весь месяц только на хлебе и на воде.","Shortly before the French Revolution, a certain Lowe appeared in Paris and started one, in principle, brilliant, project (which then, in fact, terribly burst). All Paris was agitated; Lowe's shares were buying like hot cakes, before the stampede. Money poured into the house where the subscription was opened from all over Paris as if from a sack; but the house was finally lacking: the public crowded in the street - of all ranks, conditions, ages; bourgeois, nobles, their children, countesses, marchionesses, public women - all merged into one furious, half-mad mass of those bitten by a mad dog; rank, prejudices of breed and pride, even honor and a good name - everything was trampled in one dirt; everyone sacrificed (even women) to get a few shares. The subscription finally went out into the street, but there was nowhere to write. Then one hunchback was offered to give up his hump for a while, in the form of a table for subscribing shares on it. The hunchback agreed - you can imagine at what price! Some time later (very little) everything went bust, everything went bust, the whole idea went to hell, and the stock lost all value. Who won? One hunchback, precisely because he did not take shares, but cash louis. Well, sir, I am that very hunchback! I had enough strength not to eat and to save seventy-two rubles from kopecks; it will get enough and so that even in the very whirlwind of fever that has engulfed everyone, to hold on and prefer true money to more. I am petty only in small things, but in the great - no. I often lacked character for a little patience, even after the birth of an “idea”, but for a big one, I always had enough. When my mother served me in the morning, before I went to work, cold coffee, I got angry and rude to her, and yet I was the same person who lived the whole month only on bread and water.","A short time before the French Revolution, there appeared in Paris a man called John Law who thought up a brilliant financial operation (which later blew up with a frightful bang). All Paris was in an uproar. Everyone was after Law's shares: people practically fought to get hold of them. The company that had issued the shares was raking in huge sums of money, but even so the offices couldn't handle the mad demand; people of all ages and walks of life thronged the surrounding streets; bourgeois, noblemen, their children, countesses, marquises, and prostitutes—all melted into a furious, crazy crowd, as if they'd all been bitten by rabid dogs. Rank, class, pride, sense of honor, and simple decency were all trampled in the mud; men and women were ready to sacrifice anything just to get hold of a few shares. They started buying shares in the street and when there was nothing else to write on, they asked a hunchback whether he wouldn't rent out his back as a table. He agreed, and you can imagine at what a price! Soon, indeed very soon after that, it all blew up in their faces, proved a complete flop, and the shares became worthless. Only one person wound up the winner. Who? The hunchback, of course. Why? Because he was paid not in shares but in hard cash. Well, I'm just like that hunchback. I had enough will power to abstain from eating and to save seventy-two rubles by putting aside one kopek at a time. And I reckon I'll have enough will power also to content myself with a sure profit in the middle of a general mad rush for huge future windfalls. But I'm so petty only in small matters; when it comes to big ventures, I'm different. Even after my ""idea"" was born, I often gave in on small things that required only a little patience but never on things that really mattered—I always had enough patience for them! When, in the morning before I left for my job, my mother gave me coffee that was not hot enough, I grew angry and was rude to her, although I was the same man who'd gone a whole month only on bread and water.","Not long before the French Revolution there was a man called Law in Paris who invented of himself a scheme what was theoretically magnificent but which came utterly to grief in practice afterwards. All Paris was in excitement. Law's shares were bought up at once before allotment. Money from all parts of Paris poured as from a sack into the house where the shares were subscribed. But the house was not enough at last, the public thronged the street, people of all callings, all classes, all ages: bourgeois, noblemen, their children, countesses, marquises, prostitutes, were all struggling in one infuriated, half-crazy, rabid mob. Rank, the prejudices of birth and pride, even honour and good name were all trampled in the same mire; all, even women, were ready to sacrifice anyone to gain a few shares. The list at last was passed down into the streets, but there was nothing to write on. Then it was suggested to a hunchback that he should lend his back for the time as a table on which people could sign their names for shares. The hunchback agreed—one can fancy at what a price. Some time (a very short time) after, they were all bankrupt, the whole thing went smash, the whole idea was exploded and the shares were worth nothing. Who got the best of it? Why, the hunchback, because he did not take shares but louis-d'or in cash. Well, I am that hunchback! I had strength of will enough not to eat, and to save seventy-two roubles out of my kopecks; I shall have strength enough to restrain myself and prefer a safe profit to a large one, even when every one around me is carried away by a fever of excitement. I am trivial only about trifles, not in what is important. I have often lacked fortitude for enduring little things ever since the inception of my idea, but for enduring big things I shall always have enough. When in the morning my mother gave me cold coffee before I set out to work, I was angry and rude to her, and yet I was the same person who had lived a whole month on bread and water."

"Она же, увидав Версилова, побледнела вдруг как полотно; несколько мгновений смотрела на него неподвижно, в невыразимом ужасе, и вдруг упала в обморок. Он бросился к ней. Все это теперь передо мной как бы мелькает. Я помню, как с испугом увидел я тогда его красное, почти багровое лицо и налившиеся кровью глаза. Думаю, что он хоть и заметил меня в комнате, но меня как бы не узнал. Он схватил ее, бесчувственную, с неимоверною силою поднял ее к себе на руки, как перышко, и бессмысленно стал носить ее по комнате, как ребенка. Комната была крошечная, но он слонялся из угла в угол, видимо не понимая, зачем это делает. В один какой-нибудь миг он лишился тогда рассудка. Он все смотрел на ее лицо. Я бежал за ним и, главное, боялся револьвера, который он так и забыл в своей правой руке и держал его возле самой ее головы. Но он оттолкнул меня раз локтем, другой раз ногой. Я хотел было крикнуть Тришатову, но боялся раздражить сумасшедшего. Наконец я вдруг раздвинул портьеру и стал умолять его положить ее на кровать. Он подошел и положил, а сам стал над нею, пристально с минуту смотрел ей в лицо и вдруг, нагнувшись, поцеловал ее два раза в ее бледные губы. О, я понял наконец, что это был человек уже совершенно вне себя. Вдруг он замахнулся на нее револьвером, но, как бы догадавшись, обернул револьвер и навел его ей в лицо. Я мгновенно, изо всей силы, схватил его за руку и закричал Тришатову. Помню: мы оба боролись с ним, но он успел вырвать свою руку и выстрелить в себя. Он хотел застрелить ее, а потом себя. Но когда мы не дали ее, то уткнул револьвер себе прямо в сердце, но я успел оттолкнуть его руку кверху, и пуля попала ему в плечо. В это мгновение с криком ворвалась Татьяна Павловна; но он уже лежал на ковре без чувств, рядом с Ламбертом.","She, seeing Versilov, suddenly turned pale as a sheet; She looked at him motionless for a few moments, in inexpressible horror, and suddenly fell into a swoon. He rushed towards her. All this is now flashing before me. I remember how with fright I then saw his red, almost purple face and bloodshot eyes. I think that although he noticed me in the room, he did not seem to recognize me. He grabbed her, unconscious, with incredible strength lifted her into his arms like a feather, and senselessly began to carry her around the room like a child. The room was tiny, but he wandered from corner to corner, apparently not understanding why he was doing it. In one moment, he lost his mind then. He kept looking at her face. I ran after him and, most importantly, was afraid of the revolver, which he forgot in his right hand and held it near her head. But he pushed me away once with his elbow, another time with his foot. I wanted to call out to Trishatov, but I was afraid to irritate the madman. Finally, I suddenly parted the curtain and began to beg him to put it on the bed. He went up and laid it down, and he himself stood over her, looked intently into her face for a minute, and suddenly, bending down, kissed her twice on her pale lips. Oh, I finally realized that this was a man already completely beside himself. Suddenly he swung a revolver at her, but, as if guessing, turned the revolver around and pointed it at her face. I instantly, with all my strength, grabbed his hand and shouted to Trishatov. I remember: we both fought with him, but he managed to pull out his hand and shoot himself. He wanted to shoot her and then himself. But when we did not give it, he stuck the revolver right into his heart, but I managed to push his hand up, and the bullet hit him in the shoulder. At that moment Tatyana Pavlovna rushed in with a cry; but he was already lying unconscious on the carpet, next to Lambert.","When she saw Versilov, Katerina went deathly pale. For a few seconds she stared at him and then, her face contorted in undescribable horror, she fainted. He rushed toward her. I can still see it all as though flashing before my eyes. I remember my fright upon seeing his dark red, almost purple face and his bloodshot eyes. He must have seen me, but he didn't appear to register my presence or recognize me. He picked up the unconscious Katerina as if she weighed nothing; he held her in his arms the way a nurse holds a baby and, carrying her, started pacing senselessly up and down the room. In that rather small room, he moved from corner to corner with surprising speed, obviously not knowing what he was doing. I'm sure that during those secondshis mind was quite blank. His eyes never left her face. I was trotting be-hind him , for I was afraid of the gun he was still clutching in his right hand; he'd forgotten all about it, and it was awfully close to her head. But when I got too near him, he pushed me away with his elbow, and when I tried again, he kicked me. I thought of calling Trishatov, but I was afraid it might cause the madman to go berserk. In the end I pulled aside the curtain that screened off Mrs. Prutkov's bedroom and started pleading with him to put Katerina down on the bed. To my surprise, he did just that and stood over her, still looking into her face for perhaps a whole minute. Then he bent over her, quickly kissed her pale lips, and then kissed her once more. By that time I could see clearly that he was no longer himself. Suddenly the gun flashed through the air: he'd swung at her with it. But he broke his motion in mid-air. Something seemed to have dawned on him: he turned the gun and pointed it at her face. I seized his hand and shouted for help. Trishatov came running in and the two of us tried to disarm him. But he succeeded in shaking us off and, as soon as his right hand was free, he turned the gun on himself and pressed the trigger. Probably he'd intended to shoot her first and then shoot himself, but since we'd interfered with his original plan, he'd pointed the gun at his heart. . . . Still, at the last moment I somehow succeeded in pushing his hand upward and the bullet hit him in the shoulder. . . . Just then, Mrs. Prutkov rushed in screaming at the top of her voice.","She saw Versilov, turned suddenly as white as a sheet, gazed at him for some moments immovable with indescribable horror, and fell into a swoon. He rushed to her. It all flashes before my eyes as I write. I remember with what terror I saw his flushed almost purple face and his bloodshot eyes. I believe that though he saw me in the room he did not recognise me. He caught her as she fell unconscious, and with amazing ease lifted her up in his arms, as though she were a feather, and began aimlessly carrying her about the room like a baby. It was a tiny room, but he paced to and fro from corner to corner, evidently with no idea why he was doing so. In one instant he had lost his reason. He kept gazing at her, at her face. I ran after him; what I was most afraid of was the revolver, which he seemed to have forgotten in his right hand, and was holding close to her head. But he pushed me away, once with his elbow, and the second time with his foot. I wanted to shout to Trishatov, but I was afraid of irritating the madman. At last I drew back the curtain and began entreating him to put her on the bed. He went up and laid her down on it, stood over her, and gazed at her face; and, suddenly bending down, kissed her twice on her pale lips.

I instantly seized his arm and shouted to Trishatov. I remember we both struggled with him, but he succeeded in pulling away his arm and firing at himself. He would have shot her and then himself, but since we would not let him get at her, he pressed the revolver against his heart; I succeeded, however, in pushing his arm upwards, and the bullet struck him in the shoulder. At that instant Tatyana Pavlovna burst into the room shrieking; but he was already lying senseless on the carpet beside Lambert."
"Я остановил извозчика и перескочил к Тришатову. До сих пор не понимаю, каким образом я мог так вдруг решиться, но я вдруг поверил и вдруг решился. Альфонсинка завопила ужасно, но мы ее бросили, и уж не знаю, поворотила ли она за нами или отправилась домой, но уж я ее больше не видал.","I stopped the cab and jumped over to Trishatov. I still do not understand how I could suddenly decide, but I suddenly believed and suddenly decided. Alfonsin screamed terribly, but we left her, and I don’t know if she turned after us or went home, but I didn’t see her again.","I stopped my cab, got out, and jumped into Trishatov's. I still don't know why I accepted unquestioningly what he told me. I made up my mind at once. Alphonsine screamed and squealed desperately, but we paid no attention to her, and I'm not sure whether she turned her cab around to follow us or drove on home. I never saw her again.","I stopped the driver and jumped out to join Trishatov. To this day I don't know how I could make up my mind so quickly, but I believed him at once, and made up my mind.

"Он учился в университете, но поступил в гвардию, в кавалерийский полк. Женился на Фанариотовой и вышел в отставку. Ездил за границу и, воротясь, жил в Москве в светских удовольствиях. По смерти жены прибыл в деревню; тут эпизод с моей матерью. Потом долго жил где-то на юге. В войну с Европой поступил опять в военную службу, но в Крым не попал и все время в деле не был. По окончании войны, выйдя в отставку, ездил за границу, и даже с моею матерью, которую, впрочем, оставил в Кенигсберге. Бедная рассказывала иногда с каким-то ужасом и качая головой, как она прожила тогда целые полгода, одна-одинешенька, с маленькой дочерью, не зная языка, точно в лесу, а под конец и без денег. Тогда приехала за нею Татьяна Павловна и отвезла ее назад, куда-то в Нижегородскую губернию. Потом Версилов вступил в мировые посредники первого призыва и, говорят, прекрасно исполнял свое дело; но вскоре кинул его и в Петербурге стал заниматься ведением разных частных гражданских исков. Андроников всегда высоко ставил его способности, очень уважал его и говорил лишь, что не понимает его характера. Потом Версилов и это бросил и опять уехал за границу, и уже на долгий срок, на несколько лет. Затем начались особенно близкие связи с стариком князем Сокольским. Во все это время денежные средства его изменялись раза два-три радикально: то совсем впадал в нищету, то опять вдруг богател и подымался.","He studied at the university, but entered the guard, in the cavalry regiment. He married Fanariotova and retired. Traveled abroad and, returning, lived in Moscow in secular pleasures. Upon the death of his wife, he arrived in the village; Here's an episode with my mother. Then he lived somewhere in the south for a long time. In the war with Europe, he again entered military service, but did not get to the Crimea and was not in business all the time. At the end of the war, having retired, he went abroad, and even with my mother, whom, however, he left in Konigsberg. The poor woman sometimes told with some kind of horror and shaking her head how she then lived for half a year, alone, with her little daughter, not knowing the language, as if in a forest, and in the end without money. Then Tatyana Pavlovna came for her and took her back, somewhere in the Nizhny Novgorod province. Then Versilov joined the world mediators of the first call and, they say, did his job perfectly; but soon he abandoned him and in St. Petersburg began to conduct various private civil suits. Andronikov always highly valued his abilities, respected him very much and said only that he did not understand his character. Then Versilov gave that up too and went abroad again, and this time for a long time, for several years. Then began especially close ties with the old man Prince Sokolsky. During all this time, his money changed radically two or three times: either he completely fell into poverty, then again he suddenly became rich and rose.","Versilov studied at the university but then joined a cavalry regiment of the Guards. When he married Miss Fanariotov, he resigned his commission. He traveled abroad extensively and when he returned to Moscow he led a gay social life. After the death of his wife, he went to his country estate where he had that affair with my mother. Then he lived for a long time somewhere in Southern Russia. During the Crimean War, he rejoined the Army but never saw action, indeed, never even reached the Crimea. After the war, he again resigned from the Army and went abroad. He took my mother with him but left her in Konigsberg. The poor thing told me with a strange bewilderment, helplessly shaking her head, how she had spent six whole months there alone with her tiny daughter, without speaking the language, feeling like a babe in the woods, and how in the end she had even run out of money. Finally Mrs. Prutkov had appeared, taken her back to Russia, and there whisked her off to some place near Nizhny-Novgorod. After the emancipation of the serfs, Versilov served as an arbitrator of claims between former serfs and their landlords and, I understand, he performed his duties very well. Soon, however, he resigned, moved to Petersburg, and became a counsel for parties involved in private lawsuits. Andronikov always praised his legal talents very highly, had a tremendous respect for his intelligence although, as he admitted, he could never really understand the man. Then Versilov dropped that too and went abroad again, this time for several years. This was when his close relations with the old Prince Sokolsky began. During that time his financial situation underwent two or three radical changes: he'd go completely broke, then suddenly bounce back and be rich again. Ah, why not, after all?","He studied at the university but went into a cavalry regiment of the guards. He married Mlle. Fanariotov and retired from the army.

They were all, at the time, on the Rhine, at some spa, all drinking the waters. Katerina Nikolaevna's husband was by then almost dying, he had, at any rate, been given up by the doctors. She made an impression on him at the first meeting, as it were cast a sort of spell upon him. It was a case of fate. It's remarkable that recalling it and writing it down now, I don't remember that he once used the word ""love"" in connection with her, or spoke of ""being in love. "" The word ""fate"" I remember."

"– Ce Тушар вошел с письмом в руке, подошел к нашему большому дубовому столу, за которым мы все шестеро что-то зубрили, крепко схватил меня за плечо, поднял со стула и велел захватить мои тетрадки. «Твое место не здесь, а там», – указал он мне крошечную комнатку налево из передней, где стоял простой стол, плетеный стул и клеенчатый диван – точь-в-точь как теперь у меня наверху в светелке. Я перешел с удивлением и очень оробев: никогда еще со мной грубо не обходились. Через полчаса, когда Тушар вышел из классной, я стал переглядываться с товарищами и пересмеиваться; конечно, они надо мною смеялись, но я о том не догадывался и думал, что мы смеемся оттого, что нам весело. Тут как раз налетел Тушар, схватил меня за вихор и давай таскать. «Ты не смеешь сидеть с благородными детьми, ты подлого происхождения и все равно что лакей!» И он пребольно ударил меня по моей пухлой румяной щеке. Ему это тотчас же понравилось, и он ударил меня во второй и в третий раз. Я плакал навзрыд, я был страшно удивлен. Целый час я сидел, закрывшись руками, и плакал-плакал. Произошло что-то такое, чего я ни за что не понимал. Не понимаю, как человек не злой, как Тушар, иностранец, и даже столь радовавшийся освобождению русских крестьян, мог бить такого глупого ребенка, как я. Впрочем, я был только удивлен, а не оскорблен; я еще не умел оскорбляться.

I went over with surprise and very shy: I have never been treated rudely. Half an hour later, when Touchard came out of the classroom, I began to exchange glances with my comrades and laugh; Of course, they laughed at me, but I had no idea of that and thought that we were laughing because we were having fun. Just then Tushar swooped in, grabbed me by the tuft and started dragging me. “You dare not sit with noble children, you are of vile origin and are like a lackey!” And he hit me painfully on my plump ruddy cheek. He immediately liked it and hit me a second and a third time. I wept bitterly, I was terribly surprised. For a whole hour I sat with my hands over my head and wept and wept. Something happened that I never understood. I don't understand how a person not evil like Tushar, a foreigner, and even so happy about the liberation of the Russian peasants, could beat such a stupid child like me. However, I was only surprised, not offended; I haven't gotten offended yet. It seemed to me that I had done something wrong, but when I corrected myself, they would forgive me and we would all suddenly become cheerful again, we would go to play in the yard and live in the best possible way.","""Well, that Touchard follow walked in with a letter in his hand, went up to the big oak table at which all six of us were sitting doing our homework, grabbed me by the shoulder, lifted me from my seat, and told me to pick up all my books and follow him.

I was both very surprised and very frightened, for I had never yet been treated so roughly. Later, when Touchard left the classroom, I returned there and exchanged glances with the other boys. They began to laugh and I laughed too, thinking that we were all laughing because it was funny. It never occurred to me then that they were laughing at me. But suddenly Touchard burst into the room, seized me by the hair, and started dragging me all over the place. '""You have no right to sit with respectable children! You are of disgraceful origin—you're as low as a flunkey!' And he slapped my rosy, round cheeks resoundingly. It hurt. But he obviously liked the way it felt slapping me, for he slapped me again and then again. I cried and sobbed. I was completely bewildered. For a whole hour afterward, I sat weeping with my face buried in my hands. I couldn't understand what had happened and I still don't understand how a man like Touchard, who was not particularly ferocious, who although a foreigner was so pleased about the emancipation of the Russian serfs, could enjoy beating a stupid child like me. Actually I was surprised rather than offended, for I didn't yet know what being offended was. I thought I must've done something wrong but that I'd mend my ways somehow and would be forgiven.

I went into it in amazement, very much downcast; I had never been roughly treated before. Half an hour later when Touchard had gone out of the schoolroom, I began to exchange glances and smiles with my schoolfellows; they, of course, were laughing at me; but I had no suspicion of it and thought we were laughing because we were merry. At that moment Touchard darted in, seized me by the forelock, and dragged me about. ""'Don't you dare sit with gentlemanly boys, you are a child of low origin and no better than a lackey.' ""And he gave me a stinging blow on my chubby, rosy cheek. He must have enjoyed doing so and he struck me a second time, and a third. I cried violently and was terribly astonished. For a whole hour I sat with my face hidden in my hands crying and crying. Something had happened which was utterly beyond my comprehension. I don't understand how a man, not of spiteful character, a foreigner like Touchard, who rejoiced at the emancipation of the Russian peasants, could have beaten a foolish child like me. I was only amazed, not resentful, however. I had not yet learnt to resent an insult. It seemed to me that I had somehow been naughty, that when I was good again I should be forgiven, and that we should all be merry again at once, that we should go out to play in the yard and live happy ever after."""

"Он примолк, но намереваясь продолжать все с тою же тихою и степенною улыбкою. Есть простодушие, которое доверяется всем и каждому, не подозревая насмешки. Такие люди всегда ограниченны, ибо готовы выложить из сердца все самое драгоценное пред первым встречным. Но в Макаре Ивановиче, мне казалось, было что-то другое и что-то другое движет его говорить, а не одна только невинность простодушия: как бы выглядывал пропагандист. Я с удовольствием поймал некоторую, как бы даже лукавую усмешку, обращенную им к доктору, а может быть, и к Версилову. Разговор был, очевидно, продолжением их прежних споров за неделю; но в нем, к несчастью, проскочило опять то самое роковое словцо, которое так наэлектризовало меня вчера и свело меня на одну выходку, о которой я до сих пор сожалею.","He fell silent, but intending to continue with the same quiet and sedate smile. There is an innocence that trusts everyone and everyone, not suspecting ridicule. Such people are always limited, because they are ready to lay out from their hearts all the most precious before the first comer. But in Makar Ivanovich, it seemed to me, there was something else, and something else motivated him to speak, and not only the innocence of innocence: as if a propagandist looked out. I caught with pleasure a certain, as it were, sly grin, addressed by him to the doctor, and perhaps also to Versilov. The conversation was apparently a continuation of their previous discussions of the week; but, unfortunately, that same fatal word slipped through it again, which so electrified me yesterday and led me to one trick, which I still regret.","He stopped, although he seemed to want to go on talking; the same serene smile still played on his lips. There are simple and unaffected souls who trust everybody and are not aware of the ridiculous. Such people are of limited intelligence because they're eager to reveal to any comer their most sacred secrets. But I felt there was something other than just childlike trustingness that prompted Makar to talk: there was something of a preacher in him. I detected with glee a sly little smile he darted at the doctor or perhaps even at Versilov. This conversation was probably the continuation of a discussion they'd been having all week. Unfortunately, the fatal phrase, which had electrified me so much the day before, slipped in again and this time triggered an outburst in me that I regret to this day.","He paused, though he meant to go on, still with the same gentle sedate smile. There are simple souls who put complete trust in every, one, and have no suspicion of mockery. Such people are always of limited intelligence, for they are always ready to display all that is precious in their hearts to every newcomer. But in Makar Ivanovitch I fancied there was something else, and the impulse that led him to speak was different, and not only the innocence of simplicity: one caught glimpses as it were of the missionary in him. I even caught, with pleasure, some sly glances he bent upon the doctor, and even perhaps on Versilov. The conversation was evidently a continuation of a previous discussion between them the week before, but unluckily the fatal phrase which had so electrified me the day before cropped up in it again, and led me to an outburst which I regret to this day."
"– Неприлично… Хе! – и он вдруг засмеялся. – Я понимаю, понимаю, что вам неприлично, но… мешать не будете? – подмигнул он; но в этом подмигивании было уж что-то столь нахальное, даже насмешливое, низкое! Именно он во мне предполагал какую-то низость и на эту низость рассчитывал… Это ясно было, но я никак не понимал, в чем дело.","– Indecent… Heh! and he suddenly laughed. - I understand, I understand that it is indecent for you, but ... you won’t interfere? he winked; but there was something so insolent, even mocking, base in that wink! It was he who assumed some baseness in me and counted on this baseness ... It was clear, but I did not understand what was the matter.","""You said 'indiscreet'!"" he burst out laughing. ""I understand that it would be an indiscretion on your part. ... So, then, you won't interfere, will you?"" He winked at me and now there was something quite intolerably arrogant in his wink, something mocking, and also conniving. He obviously assumed that I was ready to do something very low and despicable and he was basing his hopes on that. That much was obvious, but I couldn't think of what it could be.","""Unseemly … Ha!"" and he suddenly laughed. ""I understand, I understand, that it would be unseemly of you, but you won't interfere?"" he winked; but in that wink there was something so insolent, so low and even jeering: evidently he was assuming some meanness on my part and was reckoning upon it; that was clear, but I hadn't a notion what was meant."

I'd suddenly grasped for the first time what it would really be like for Lisa to spend the rest of her life with this maniac. He glanced at me, got up, took a few steps across the room, about-faced, resumed his seat, and again held his head between his hands.","""Sergay Petrovitch, surely you won't sacrifice her by taking her away with you!

"Итак, что до чувств и отношений моих к Лизе, то все, что было наружу, была лишь напускная, ревнивая ложь с обеих сторон, но никогда мы оба не любили друг друга сильнее, как в это время. Прибавлю еще, что к Макару Ивановичу, с самого появления его у нас, Лиза, после первого удивления и любопытства, стала почему-то относиться почти пренебрежительно, даже высокомерно. Она как бы нарочно не обращала на него ни малейшего внимания.","And so, as far as my feelings and relations with Lisa, everything that came out was only a feigned, jealous lie on both sides, but we both never loved each other more than at that time. I will also add that, from the very moment he appeared with us, Liza, after the first surprise and curiosity, for some reason began to treat Makar Ivanovich almost contemptuously, even arrogantly. She didn't seem to pay any attention to him.","And so the feelings I showed toward Lisa and our mutual relations were only an affected coolness, a pretended family rivalry, when in reality we had never loved each other more. Let me note too that, after her first surprise and curiosity about Makar's presence in the house, Lisa somehow began to treat him almost condescendingly, I might even say scornfully. Often she simply ignored him.","And so, as regards my feeling and my attitude towards Liza, any external change there was was only simulated, a jealous deception on both sides, but we had never loved each other more than at that time. I must add, too, that though Liza showed surprise and interest when Makar Ivanovitch first arrived, she had since for some reason begun to treat him almost disdainfully, even contemptuously. She seemed intentionally to take not the slightest notice of him."

"Ужасно поражен был и я. Я сообразил, что это, вероятно, та самая молодая женщина прокричала, которая давеча убежала в таком волнении. Но каким же образом и тут Версилов? Вдруг раздался опять давешний визг, неистовый, визг озверевшего от гнева человека, которому чего-то не дают или которого от чего-то удерживают. Разница с давешним была лишь та, что крики и взвизги продолжались еще дольше. Слышалась борьба, какие-то слова, частые, быстрые: «Не хочу, не хочу, отдайте, сейчас отдайте!» – или что-то в этом роде – не могу совершенно припомнить. Затем, как и давеча, кто-то стремительно бросился к дверям и отворил их. Обе соседки выскочили в коридор, одна, как и давеча, очевидно удерживая другую. Стебельков, уже давно вскочивший с дивана и с наслаждением прислушивавшийся, так и сиганул к дверям и тотчас преоткровенно выскочил в коридор прямо к соседкам. Разумеется, я тоже подбежал к дверям. Но его появление в коридоре было ведром холодной воды: соседки быстро скрылись и с шумом захлопнули за собою дверь. Стебельков прыгнул было за ними, но приостановился, подняв палец, улыбаясь и соображая; на этот раз в улыбке его я разглядел что-то чрезвычайно скверное, темное и зловещее. Увидав хозяйку, стоявшую опять у своих дверей, он скорыми цыпочками побежал к ней через коридор; прошушукав с нею минуты две и, конечно, получив сведения, он уже осанисто и решительно воротился в комнату, взял со стола свой цилиндр, мельком взглянулся в зеркало, взъерошил волосы и с самоуверенным достоинством, даже не поглядев на меня, отправился к соседкам. Мгновение он прислушивался у двери, подставив ухо и победительно подмигивая через коридор хозяйке, которая грозила ему пальцем и покачивала головой, как бы выговаривая: «Ох шалун, шалун!» Наконец с решительным, но деликатнейшим видом, даже как бы сгорбившись от деликатности, постучал костями пальцев к соседкам. Послышался голос:","I was terribly surprised too. I realized that it was probably the same young woman who had run away in such agitation the other day. But how is Versilov here, too? Suddenly there was again the screeching of the past, a frantic screeching of a man brutalized with anger, to whom something is not being given or who is being held back from something. The only difference from the previous one was that the screams and screams continued even longer. There was a struggle, some words, frequent, quick: “I don’t want, I don’t want, give it back, give it back now!” - or something like that - I can't quite remember. Then, as before, someone rushed to the door and opened it. Both neighbors jumped out into the corridor, one, as before, obviously holding the other. Stebelkov, who had long since jumped up from the sofa and listened with pleasure, rushed to the door and at once frankly ran out into the corridor straight to the neighbors. Of course, I also ran to the door. But his appearance in the corridor was a bucket of cold water: the neighbors quickly disappeared and slammed the door behind them with a noise. Stebelkov was about to jump after them, but he paused, raising his finger, smiling and pondering; this time in his smile I saw something extremely nasty, dark and ominous. Seeing the hostess, who was again standing at her door, he quickly ran to her on tiptoe through the corridor; after whispering with her for about two minutes and, of course, having received information, he already dignifiedly and resolutely returned to the room, took his top hat from the table, glanced briefly in the mirror, tousled his hair and with self-confident dignity, without even looking at me, went to the neighbors. For a moment he listened at the door, his ear out and winking victoriously across the corridor to the hostess, who shook her finger at him and shook her head, as if saying: ""Oh, rascal, rascal!"" Finally, with a resolute but most delicate look, even as if hunched over from delicacy, he tapped the bones of his fingers to the neighbors. A voice was heard:","I was completely dumbfounded. It must have been the voice of the girl who had rushed out of the room before and run downstairs, I thought. But how could Versilov be involved here too? Then I heard that wild, animal-like shriek again—someone seemed to be trying frantically to do or get something and was being forcibly prevented. Now the shrieking lasted longer than the first time. There were sounds suggesting a struggle and the panting words "" No, no, I don't want to. . . . Give it back . . . give it back at once. . . ."" or something to that effect, I don't remember exactly. Then, like the first time, someone dashed toward the door and flung it open. The two women rushed into the passage just as they had before, one trying to restrain the other. Stebelkov, who had been on his feet since the noise began and had been blissfully eavesdropping, unabashedly burst out of the room into the passage. Of course, I followed him to the door. But the sight of Stebelkov apparently had the effect of a bucket of cold water on the two women because they both rushed back into their room, slamming the door behind them. Stebelkov was on the point of following them but thought better of it, stopped short, raised one finger, and grinned, obviously having thought of something. And this time I detected something evil, vicious, and sinister in that grin of his. The landlady again appeared at the end of the corridor and Stebelkov quickly ran to her on tiptoe. They had a whispered exchange that lasted for a couple of minutes, after which, probably having received the necessary information, he walked back, this time with an air of ponderous dignity. He came into the room, picked up his top hat, glanced at the mirror, ran his fingers through his hair, and, without even turning his head in my direction, went out into the corridor and stopped by the door to the room of the two women. He held his ear close to the door, winking triumphantly at the landlady, who was shaking her finger coyly at him as if to say: ""Oh, you're so naughty, so terribly naughty!"" Finally, with an air of determination, very tactful determination of course—he even seemed to shrink from tactfulness—he rapped lightly on the door with his knuckles. A voice from inside asked ""Who's there?"" and Stebelkov answered in a dignified, loud, and clear voice:","I too was tremendously struck. I reflected that the speaker was probably the same young girl who had run down the stairs in such excitement. But how did Versilov come to be mixed up in this too? Suddenly there came again the same shriek, the furious shriek of some one savage with anger, who has been prevented from getting or doing something. The only difference was that the cries and shrieks were more prolonged than before. There were sounds of a struggle, a torrent of words , ""I won't, I won't,"" ""Give it up, give it up at once!"" or something of the sort, I don't remember exactly. Then, just as before, some one rushed to the door and opened it. Both the people in the room rushed out into the passage, one just as before, trying to restrain the other. Stebelkov, who had leapt up from the sofa, and been listening with relish, fairly flew to the door, and with extreme lack of ceremony dashed into the passage straight upon the two. I too, of course, ran to the door. But his appearance in the passage acted like a pail of cold water. The two women vanished instantly, and shut the door with a slam. Stebelkov was on the point of dashing after them, but he stopped short, held up his finger with a smile, and stood considering. This time I detected in his smile something nasty, evil and malignant. Seeing the landlady, who was again standing in her doorway, he ran quickly across the passage to her on tiptoe; after whispering to her for a minute or two, and no doubt receiving information, he came back to the room, resuming his air of ponderous dignity, picked up his top-hat from the table, looked at himself in the looking-glass as he passed, ruffled up his hair, and with self-complacent dignity went to the next door without even a glance in my direction. For an instant he held his ear to the door, listening, then winked triumphantly across the passage to the landlady, who shook her finger and wagged her head at him, as though to say, ""Och, naughty man, naughty man!"" Finally with an air of resolute, even of shrinking delicacy, he knocked with his knuckles at the door. A voice asked:"

"Из моего бреда, вранья, лепета, восторгов и проч. он узнал, во-первых, почти все фамилии в точности, и даже иные адресы. Во-вторых, составил довольно приблизительное понятие о значении этих лиц (старого князя, ее, Бьоринга, Анны Андреевны и даже Версилова); третье: узнал, что я оскорблен и грожусь отмстить, и, наконец, четвертое, главнейшее: узнал, что существует такой документ, таинственный и спрятанный, такое письмо, которое если показать полусумасшедшему старику князю, то он, прочтя его и узнав, что собственная дочь считает его сумасшедшим и уже «советовалась с юристами» о том, как бы его засадить, – или сойдет с ума окончательно, или прогонит ее из дому и лишит наследства, или женится на одной mademoiselle Версиловой, на которой уже хочет жениться и чего ему не позволяют. Одним словом, Ламберт очень многое понял; без сомнения, ужасно много оставалось темного, но шантажный искусник все-таки попал на верный след. Когда я убежал потом от Альфонсины, он немедленно разыскал мой адрес (самым простым средством: в адресном столе); потом немедленно сделал надлежащие справки, из коих узнал, что все эти лица, о которых я ему врал, существуют действительно. Тогда он прямо приступил к первому шагу.","From my delirium, lies, babble, delights, and so on. he learned, firstly, almost all the names exactly, and even other addresses. Secondly, he made up a rather approximate concept of the significance of these persons (the old prince, her, Bjoring, Anna Andreevna, and even Versilov); third: I found out that I was offended and threatened to take revenge, and, finally, the fourth, most important thing: I found out that there was such a document, mysterious and hidden, such a letter, his daughter thinks he is crazy and has already “consulted with lawyers” about how to plant him - either she will go completely crazy, or drive her out of the house and deprive her of her inheritance, or marry one mademoiselle Versilova, whom she already wants to marry and what to him do not allow. In a word, Lambert understood a great deal; no doubt, there was an awful lot of darkness left, but the blackmailing master nevertheless got on the right track. When I later ran away from Alfonsina, he immediately sought out my address (by the simplest means: in the address table); then he immediately made the proper inquiries, from which he learned that all these persons, about whom I had lied to him, really exist. Then he went straight to the first step.","From my ravings, disconnected utterances, mutterings, and exclamations, Lambert learned all the exact names, family names, and even sometimes the addresses he needed. Then he managed to get a rough idea of the connections between the persons involved (the old prince, her, Bjoring, Anna, and Versilov). Also, he gathered that I wanted to avenge the insults I'd suffered. And finally, most important of all, he knew now of the existence of a certain document, a secret letter, hidden away somewhere, which, if shown to the crazy old prince, would reveal to him that his own daughter considered him abnormal and had already discussed with her attorneys how to put him out to pasture. That would either drive the old man really insane, or make him turn his daughter out of his house and cut her out of his will, or finally prompt him to marry Miss Anna Versilov, whom he wanted to marry but was restrained from by his family's opposition. To make a long story short, Lambert had understood plenty. And although many fine points still escaped him, this apprentice blackmailer was on the right track. That was why, after my escape from Alphonsine's custody, he didn't have much difficulty in finding me (he simply asked for Versi-lov's address at the Registry Office). Then he also made the necessary inquiries to check whether all the persons whose names I had tossed around in my babbling really existed. They did. After that, he quickly made his first move.","From my deliriums, my ravings, my mutterings, my transports, and so on, he learned, to begin with, almost all the surnames correctly, and even some addresses. And, secondly, he was able to get a fairly correct idea of the consequence of the persons concerned (the old prince, HER, Büring, Anna Andreyevna, and even Versilov); thirdly, he learned that I had been insulted and was threatening revenge; and lastly, and chiefly, that there was in existence a mysterious, hidden document, a letter, such, that if it were shown to a half-crazy old prince he would learn that his own daughter thought him a lunatic and was already consulting lawyers to get him locked up—and would either go quite mad, or would turn her out of the house, and leave her out of his will, or would marry a certain Mme. Versilov whom he already wanted to marry, and was being prevented from marrying. In short, Lambert understood a great deal; no doubt a great deal still remained obscure, but the expert blackmailer had anyway dropped on a trustworthy scent. When I ran away afterwards from Alphonsine he promptly found out my address (in the simplest possible way, by going to the address bureau); and then immediately made the necessary inquiries, from which he discovered that all these persons about whom I had babbled to him did actually exist. Then he promptly took the first step."

"Предложить измену несчастному потому, что этот несчастный «не стоит» ее, и, главное, предложить это беременной от этого несчастного женщине, – вот ум этих людей! Я называю это страшною теоретичностью и совершенным незнанием жизни, происходящим от безмерного самолюбия. И вдобавок ко всему, Лиза самым ясным образом разглядела, что он даже гордился своим поступком, хотя бы потому, например, что знал уже о ее беременности. Со слезами негодования она поспешила к князю, и тот, – тот даже перещеголял Васина: кажется бы, мог убедиться после рассказа, что уже ревновать теперь нечего; но тут-то он и сошел с ума. Впрочем, ревнивые все таковы!

And on top of that, Lisa saw in the clearest way that he was even proud of his act, if only because, for example, he already knew about her pregnancy. With tears of indignation, she hurried to the prince, and he - he even outdid Vasin: it would seem that after the story he could be convinced that there was nothing to be jealous of now; but then he went mad. However, everyone is jealous! He made her a terrible scene and insulted her so that she decided to break off all relations with him immediately.","To suggest to a woman that she betray a man down on his luck just because he's a poor wretch and doesn't deserve her affection and then offer to marry her when she's carrying the child of that wretch—that's how the brain of these intelligent people operates! This comes from absolute reliance on one's own theorizing, combined with a total failure to understand what life means and, I maintain, with an infinite conceit. And, on top of all that, Lisa was sure that he was very proud of his performance, if only because he knew perfectly well that she was pregnant. Straight from Vasin, with tears still in her eyes, Lisa rushed to Sergei's prison; but there Sergei hurt her even more than Vasin. Somehow now, when seemingly Sergei had no reason left for jealousy, he went raving mad. But this is how jealousy is. Sergei made a dreadful scene and insulted her so horribly that Lisa almost made up her mind to break with him for good and never see him again.","To suggest deserting a man in misfortune because that man was ""unworthy of her,"" and above all to suggest it to a woman who was with child by that very man—there you have the mind of these people! I call this being dreadfully theoretical and knowing nothing whatever of life, and put it down to a prodigious conceit. And what's more, Liza saw quite clearly that he was actually proud of his action, because he knew of her condition. With tears of indignation she hurried off to Prince Sergay, and he positively surpassed Vassin. One would have thought that after what she told him he might have been convinced that he had no cause for jealousy; but he became perfectly frantic. But jealous people are always like that! He made a fearful scene and insulted her so outrageously that she almost resolved to break off all relations with him."
Глава шестая,Chapter Six,Chapter 6,Chapter 6
"И, уж конечно, это был фатум. Он не захотел его, «не захотел любить». Не знаю, смогу ли передать это ясно; но только вся душа его была возмущена именно от факта, что с ним это могло случиться. Все-де, что было в нем свободного, разом уничтожалось пред этой встречей, и человек навеки приковывался к женщине, которой совсем до него не было дела. Он не пожелал этого рабства страсти. Скажу теперь прямо: Катерина Николаевна есть редкий тип светской женщины – тип, которого в этом кругу, может быть, и не бывает. Это – тип простой и прямодушной женщины в высшей степени. Я слышал, то есть я знаю наверно, что тем-то она и была неотразима в свете, когда в нем появлялась (она почасту удалялась из него совсем). Версилов, разумеется, не поверил тогда, при первой встрече с нею, что она – такая, а именно поверил обратному, то есть что она – притворщица и иезуитка. Здесь приведу, забегая вперед, ее собственное суждение о нем: она утверждала, что он и не мог о ней подумать иначе, «потому что идеалист, стукнувшись лбом об действительность, всегда, прежде других, наклонен предположить всякую мерзость». Я не знаю, справедливо ли это вообще об идеалистах, но о нем, конечно, было справедливо вполне. Впишу здесь, пожалуй, и собственное мое суждение, мелькнувшее у меня в уме, пока я тогда его слушал: я подумал, что любил он маму более, так сказать, гуманною и общечеловеческою любовью, чем простою любовью, которою вообще любят женщин, и чуть только встретил женщину, которую полюбил этою простою любовью, то тотчас же и не захотел этой любви – вероятнее всего с непривычки. Впрочем, может быть, это – мысль неверная; ему я, конечно, не высказал. Было бы неделикатно; да и клянусь, он был в таком состоянии, что его почти надо было щадить: он был взволнован; в иных местах рассказа иногда просто обрывал и молчал по нескольку минут, расхаживая с злым лицом по комнате.","And, of course, it was fate. He did not want him, ""did not want to love."" I don't know if I can convey it clearly; but only his whole soul was indignant precisely at the fact that this could happen to him. Everything that was free in him was immediately destroyed before this meeting, and the man was forever chained to a woman who did not care about him at all. He did not want this slavery of passion. Now I will say frankly: Katerina Nikolaevna is a rare type of secular woman - a type that, perhaps, does not exist in this circle. This is the type of a simple and straightforward woman in the highest degree. I have heard, that is, I know for sure, that it was precisely for this reason that she was irresistible in the world when she appeared in it (she often left it completely). Versilov, of course, did not believe then, at the first meeting with her, that she was like that, namely, he believed the opposite, that is, that she was a pretender and a Jesuit. Here I will give, looking ahead, her own judgment about him: she claimed that he could not have thought of her otherwise, “because the idealist, having bumped his forehead against reality, always, before others, is inclined to suggest all sorts of abominations.” I don't know if this is true of the idealists at all, but it certainly was true of him. I will write here, perhaps, my own judgment, which flashed through my mind while I was listening to him then: I thought that he loved my mother more, so to speak, with a humane and universal love than with the simple love that women generally love, and a little As soon as he met a woman whom he loved with this simple love, he immediately did not want this love - most likely out of habit. However, perhaps this is an incorrect idea; Of course, I didn't tell him. It would be indelicate; and I swear, he was in such a state that he almost had to be spared: he was agitated; in other parts of the story, sometimes he simply interrupted and was silent for several minutes, pacing around the room with an angry face.","And certainly it was fate. It was not his choice, he did not want to love. I'm not sure I can make it clear, but his whole being was outraged that such a thing could have happened to him. All the freedom he'd had before he met her was destroyed and he was chained to a woman who had no particular interest in him. He did not choose to be a slave to his passion. I'll say plainly: Katerina is a rare species of aristocratic woman, a species so rare that perhaps it no longer exists in high society: a completely straightforward and natural woman. I've heard it said about her and I know myself that this is what made her so irresistible in society, that is, on the occasions when she chose to appear there (because she stayed away from society for long periods at a time). Of course, after their first meeting, Versilov refused to believe that she was all that; indeed, he suspected just the opposite, namely, that she was a hypocrite and a Jesuit. Here, anticipating, I will quote what she herself said about that judgment of his: ""He couldn't help thinking the way he did. Like every idealist, as soon as he knocks his head against reality, he assumes at once that there's some horrid trick behind it. "" Well, I don't know whether her words really apply to all idealists, but I'm sure they fit him perfectly. I may also add here the thought that flashed through my head while I was listening to him: I assumed that he loved Mother with the abstract, humanitarian love that one feels for mankind as a whole rather than with the simple love that a man must feel for a woman; so that the moment he met a woman for whom he felt that simple love, he refused to recognize it, probably partly from lack of experience. But perhaps I was wrong and, of course, I didn't express any opinion. It would have been indiscreet to start with. Besides, he was so wound up that I had to be careful not to hurt him now: his agitation was so violent that, at certain points in his narrative, he suddenly stopped and remained silent for several minutes, pacing the room with a spiteful expression on his face.","And, of course, it was fate. He did NOT CHOOSE it, ""he did not want to love her. "" I don't know whether I can give a clear account of it, but his whole soul was in revolt at the fact that this could have happened to him. Everything in him that was free was annihilated by this meeting. And the man was fettered for life to a woman who had really nothing to do with him. He did not desire this slavery of passion. To state the fact plainly, Katerina Nikolaevna is a type rare amongst society women—a type perhaps unique in that circle. That is, she is an extremely good-natured and straightforward woman. I've heard, indeed I know for a fact that this was what made her irresistible in the fashionable world whenever she made her appearance in it. (She used at times to withdraw into complete seclusion.) Versilov did not believe, of course, when he first met her, that she was like that; in fact, he believed she was the exact opposite, that she was a hypocrite and a Jesuit. At this point I will anticipate by quoting her own criticism of him: she declared that he could not help thinking what he did of her ""because an idealist always runs his head against reality and is more inclined than other people to assume anything horrid."" I don't know if this is true of idealists in general, but it was entirely true of him, no doubt. I may perhaps add here my own judgment, which flashed across my mind while I was listening to him then: I thought that he loved mother, more so to say with the humane love one feels for all mankind, than with the simple love with which women are loved as a rule, and that as soon as he met a woman whom he began to love with that simple love, he at once turned against that love—most probably because the feeling was new to him. Perhaps, though, this idea is incorrect; I did not of course utter it to him. It would have been indelicate, and he really was in such a condition that it was almost necessary to spare him: he was agitated; at some points in his story he simply broke off, and was silent for some moments, walking about the room with a vindictive face."

"Да, эта последняя мысль вырвалась у меня тогда, и я даже не заметил ее. Вот какие мысли, последовательно одна за другой, пронеслись тогда в моей голове, и я был чистосердечен тогда с собой: я не лукавил, не обманывал сам себя; и если чего не осмыслил тогда в ту минуту, то потому лишь, что ума недостало, а не из иезуитства пред самим собой.","Yes, this last thought escaped me then, and I did not even notice it. These are the thoughts, successively one after another, then flashed through my head, and I was sincere with myself then: I did not dissemble, I did not deceive myself; and if he didn’t comprehend something then at that moment, it was only because he lacked intelligence, and not out of Jesuitism before himself.","Yes, that last thought sprang up in my mind by itself, without my noticing it almost. So this was the sequence of thoughts that passed through my head since I was completely sincere with myself. I didn't deceive myself, didn't try to make things different from what they were, and if there was something I failed to take in at that moment, it was simply from lack of brains and not from hypocritical self-deception.","That last thought rose spontaneously in my mind and I did not even remark it. Such were the thoughts that floated through my mind one after another, and I was straightforward with myself; I did not cheat or deceive myself; and if there was anything I did not understand at that moment, it was not from sophistry with myself but only from lack of brains."
"Она ушла. Главное, я понял, что тут тон изменяется: они со мной начинали говорить грубо. Ясно было, что это – опять секрет; секреты накоплялись с каждым шагом, с каждым часом. В первый раз молодой Версилов приезжал с сестрой, с Анной Андреевной, когда я был болен; про это я слишком хорошо помнил, равно и то, что Анна Андреевна уже закинула мне вчера удивительное словечко, что, может быть, старый князь остановится на моей квартире… но все это было так сбито и так уродливо, что я почти ничего не мог на этот счет придумать. Хлопнув себя по лбу и даже не присев отдохнуть, я побежал к Анне Андреевне: ее не оказалось дома, а от швейцара получил ответ, что «поехали в Царское; завтра только разве около этого времени будут».","She left. The main thing, I realized that here the tone changes: they began to speak rudely to me. It was clear that this was again a secret; secrets accumulated with every step, with every hour. The first time young Versilov came with his sister, Anna Andreyevna, was when I was ill; I remembered this all too well, as well as the fact that Anna Andreevna had already thrown a surprising word at me yesterday, that perhaps the old prince would stop at my apartment ... but it was all so confused and so ugly that I could hardly do anything at all. come up with this account. Slapping my forehead and not even sitting down to rest, I ran to Anna Andreevna: she was not at home, and from the porter I received the answer that “we went to Tsarskoye; Tomorrow, only perhaps around this time will be.","She left. I realized now that she'd spoken to me in a different tone. They were no longer as polite with me as before. There was obviously some reason for it, a new mystery. Ah, those mysteries! They were piling up and up. The young Versilov had first come with his sister Anna during my illness. That I knew only too well. Also, I remembered what Anna had made me understand the day before to my great surprise—namely, that the old prince might make use of my apartment to get married. But it was all so strange and incongruous that I didn't even know what to think of it. I slapped my forehead and, without even sitting down for a short rest, I started off for Anna's. There, the hall porter told me that Miss Versilov had gone to Tsarskoe and wouldn't be back before ""perhaps this time tomorrow at the earliest.""","She went away. The chief thing I gathered was the change of tone. They had begun to be rude to me. It was clear that this was another secret; secrets were accumulating with every step, with every hour. For the first time young Versilov had come with his sister, with Anna Andreyevna, when I was ill; I remember that perfectly, as well as Anna Andreyevna's amazing words the day before, that, perhaps, the old prince would stay at my rooms… . But all this was so mixed up and so monstrous that I could scarcely gather anything from it. Clapping my hands to my forehead, and not even sitting down to rest, I ran to Anna Andreyevna's; it appeared that she was not at home, and I received from the porter the information that ""she had gone to Tsarskoe; and might, perhaps, not be back till about this time to-morrow."""

"Одел его Максим Иванович как барчонка, и учителя нанял, и с того самого часу за книгу засадил; и так дошло, что и с глаз его не спускает, все при себе. Чуть мальчик зазевается, он уж и кричит: «За книгу! учись: я тебя человеком сделать хочу». А мальчик хилый, с того самого разу, после побоев-то, кашлять стал. «У меня ль не житье! – дивится Максим Иванович, – у матери босой бегал, корки жевал, чего ж он еще пуще прежнего хил?» А учитель и говорит: «Всякому мальчику, говорит, надо и порезвиться, не все учиться; ему моцион необходим», и вывел ему все резоном. Максим Иванович подумал: «Это ты правду говоришь». А был тот учитель Петр Степанович, царство ему небесное, как бы словно юродивый; пил уж оченно, так даже, что и слишком, и по тому самому его давно уже от всякого места отставили и жил по городу все одно что милостыней, а ума был великого и в науках тверд. «Мне бы не здесь быть, – сам говорил про себя, – мне в университете профессором только быть, а здесь я в грязь погружен и „самые одежды мои возгнушались мною“. Сел Максим Иванович и кричит мальчику: „Резвись!“ – а тот перед ним еле дышит. И до того дошло, что самого голосу его ребенок не мог снести – так весь и затрепещется. А Максим-то Иванович все пуще удивляется: „Ни он такой, ни он этакой; я его из грязи взял, в драдедам одел; на нем полсапожки матерчатые, рубашка с вышивкой, как генеральского сына держу, чего ж он ко мне не привержен? Чего как волчонок молчит?“ И хоть давно уж все перестали удивляться на Максима Ивановича, но тут опять задивились: из себя вышел человек; к этакому малому ребенку пристал, отступиться не может. „Жив не желаю быть, а характер в нем искореню. Меня отец его, на смертном одре, уже святого причастья вкусив, проклинал; это у него отцовский характер“. И ведь даже ни разу лозы не употребил (с того разу боялся). Запугал он его, вот что. Без лозы запугал.","Maxim Ivanovich dressed him up like a young lady, and hired a teacher, and from that very hour put him to work for a book; and so it came to him that he didn’t take his eyes off him, everything was with him. As soon as the boy gapes, he already shouts: “For the book! learn: I want to make you a man. And the boy is frail, from that very time, after the beatings, he began to cough. “I don’t have a life! - Maxim Ivanovich marvels, - he ran barefoot at his mother, chewed crusts, why is he even more frail than ever? And the teacher says: “Every boy, he says, needs to frolic, not everyone needs to study; he needs exercise, ”and brought him everything for a reason. Maxim Ivanovich thought: ""You are telling the truth."" And there was that teacher Pyotr Stepanovich, the kingdom of heaven to him, as if he were a holy fool; he drank very much, even to the point of drinking too much, and for that very reason he had long been set aside from any place and lived around the city all the same as almsgiving, and he had a great mind and was firm in the sciences. “I wouldn’t be here,” he said to himself, “I only have to be a professor at the university, but here I am immersed in mud and“ my very clothes despised me. Maxim Ivanovich sat down and shouted to the boy: “Play!” - and the boy was barely breathing in front of him. And it came to such a point that the child could not bear his own voice - so he would tremble all over. And Maxim Ivanovich is more and more surprised: “Neither he is, nor he is such; I took him out of the mud, dressed him in dreadlocks; he is wearing half boots made of cloth, an embroidered shirt, like I hold a general's son, why is he not attached to me? Why is the wolf cub silent?' And although everyone had long ceased to be surprised at Maxim Ivanovich, they were surprised again: the man lost his temper; he has stuck to such a small child, he cannot back down. “I don’t want to be alive, but I will eradicate the character in it. His father, on his deathbed, having already tasted the holy communion, cursed me; It's his father's character."" And after all, he never even used vines (he was afraid from that time). He scared him, that's what. Intimidated without a vine.","Maxim had the boy dressed up like a little gentleman; he hired a teacher for him, and from that time on watched over the boy's studies himself. Whenever the boy would take his nose out of his books for a second, he would be sure to hear Maxim shouting: ""Hey, boy, read your book! Study! I want to make an educated man out of you!"" The boy, who had always been delicate, coughed a lot since the flogging. ""Why should he grow even weaker than before?"" Maxim wondered. ""Why, at his mother's he had to run around barefoot and live on stale bread! What better life could he wish for than in my house?"" ""But,"" the boy's teacher said, ""a boy needs to play; he can't just study all the time, he has to have exercise too."" And he made Maxim see reason. ""Makes sense, what you say,"" Maxim agreed. That teacher's name was Peter Stepanovich—may he rest in peace! — and he was in a way like one of those simple-minded village holy men. For one thing, he drank too much, so much, in fact, that he hadn't been able to get a job any more and had to live on handouts before Maxim had hired him. But he was really a very learned man and had brains. "" This is no place for me,"" he thought to himself. ""It's in a university that I belong, as a professor. For here Fve sunk so deep into the mud that my own clothes are ashamed of me."" And so, one day, Maxim came in, sat down, looked at the boy, and suddenly barked at him: ""All right, play now!"" But the boy just stared at him, hardly able to breathe from fright. For it had got to the point where the boy would start trembling all over whenever he heard Maxim's voice. This time Maxim was really puzzled: ""It's no use, he's no good. I pulled him out of the filth he was living in. I put expensive clothes on his back; I bought him an embroidered shirt and nice leather shoes for his feet, and I'm treating him as if he was the son of a general, but I see he still isn't grateful. Why must he act like a little wolf cub? Why won't he talk to me?"" And although the townsfolk had by then grown used to Maxim's ways, he still managed to surprise them once again: they couldn't see how a man could get worked up like that over a little boy. He wouldn't leave the child in peace. ""I don't care if it kills me,"" he said, ""but I'll break that boy! His father cursed me as he lay dying, even after he'd taken the last sacraments, and this boy is just like his father."" And although, mind you, he never once used the rod on the child—he was afraid after what had happened—he could frighten the wits out of him all the same, even without a rod.","Maxim Ivanovitch dressed him like a little gentleman, and hired a teacher for him, and sat him at his book from that hour forward; and it came to his never leaving him out of his sight, always keeping him with him. The boy could scarcely begin to yawn before he'd shout at him, ""Mind your book! Study! I want to make a man of you."" And the boy was frail; ever since the time of that beating he'd had a cough. "" As though we didn't live well in my house!"" said Maxim Ivanovitch, wondering; ""at his mother's he used to run barefoot and gnaw crusts; why is he more puny than before?"" And the teacher said, "" Every boy,"" says he, ""needs to play about, not to be studying all the time; he needs exercise,"" and he explained it all to him reasonably. Maxim Ivanovitch reflected. ""That's true,"" he said. And that teacher's name was Pyotr Stepanovitch; the Kingdom of Heaven be his! He was almost like a crazy saint, he drank much, too much indeed, and that was the reason he had been turned out of so many places, and he lived in the town on alms one may say, but he was of great intelligence and strong in science. ""This is not the place for me,"" he thought to himself, ""I ought to be a professor in the university; here I'm buried in the mud, my very garments loathe me."" Maxim Ivanovitch sits and shouts to the child, ""Play!"" and he scarcely dares to breathe before him. And it came to such a pass that the boy could not hear the sound of his voice without trembling all over. And Maxim Ivanovitch wondered more and more. "" He's neither one thing nor the other; I picked him out of the mud, I dressed him in drap de dames with little boots of good material, he has embroidered shirts like a general's son, why has he not grown attached to me? Why is he as dumb as a little wolf?"" And though people had long given up being surprised at Maxim Ivanovitch, they began to be surprised at him again—the man was beside himself: he pestered the little child and would never let him alone. ""As sure as I'm alive I'll root up his character. His father cursed me on his deathbed after he'd taken the last sacrament. It's his father's character."" And yet he didn't once use the birch to him (after that time he was afraid to). He frightened him, that's what he did. He frightened him without a birch."
"– Гм. – Он подмигнул и сделал рукой какой-то жест, вероятно долженствовавший обозначать что-то очень торжествующее и победоносное; затем весьма солидно и спокойно вынул из кармана газету, очевидно только что купленную, развернул и стал читать в последней странице, по-видимому оставив меня в совершенном покое. Минут пять он не глядел на меня.","- Hm. He winked and made a gesture with his hand, probably meant to signify something very triumphant and victorious; then, very solidly and calmly, he took out a newspaper from his pocket, obviously just bought, opened it and began to read in the last page, apparently leaving me in complete peace.

"Что же до характера моей матери, то до восемнадцати лет Татьяна Павловна продержала ее при себе, несмотря на настояния приказчика отдать в Москву в ученье, и дала ей некоторое воспитание, то есть научила шить, кроить, ходить с девичьими манерами и даже слегка читать. Писать моя мать никогда не умела сносно. В глазах ее этот брак с Макаром Ивановым был давно уже делом решенным, и все, что тогда с нею произошло, она нашла превосходным и самым лучшим; под венец пошла с самым спокойным видом, какой только можно иметь в таких случаях, так что сама уж Татьяна Павловна назвала ее тогда рыбой. Все это о тогдашнем характере матери я слышал от самой же Татьяны Павловны. Версилов приехал в деревню ровно полгода спустя после этой свадьбы.","As for my mother's character, until the age of eighteen Tatyana Pavlovna kept her with her, despite the insistence of the clerk to send her to Moscow for apprenticeship, and gave her some education, that is, taught her to sew, cut, walk with girlish manners and even read a little. My mother was never good at writing. In her eyes, this marriage to Makar Ivanov had long since been decided, and everything that happened to her then she found excellent and the best; she went down the aisle with the calmest air one can have on such occasions, so that Tatyana Pavlovna herself then called her a fish. I heard all this about the then character of my mother from Tatyana Pavlovna herself. Versilov arrived in the village exactly six months after this wedding.","As to my mother, Mrs. Prutkov overruled the clerk in charge of Ver-silov's serfs who wanted to send her to Moscow as an apprentice. She kept her in her house until the age of eighteen and taught her a few things—that is, sewing, making clothes, ladylike deportment, and even a little reading. My mother never learned to write passably. She looked upon her marriage to Makar Dolgoruky as something settled long ago and believed that whatever happened to her was the best that could happen and was just wonderful. And on her wedding day she was as calm a bride as anyone had ever seen, so that even Mrs. Prutkov described her as a ""fish. "" All this about my mother's character at that time was told to me by Mrs. Prutkov herself. It was six months after the wedding that Versilov arrived at the estate.","As for my mother, Tatyana Pavlovna had kept her till the age of eighteen in her house, although the steward had urged that the girl should be sent to Moscow to be trained.

She looked upon this marriage with Makar Ivanovitch as something settled long ago, and everything that happened to her in those days she considered very good and all for the best. She went to her wedding looking as unmoved as anyone could on such an occasion, so much so that even Tatyana Pavlovna called her a fish.

"Помню (так как я помню все это утро до мелочи), что между нами произошла тогда прегадкая, по своей реальной правде, сцена. Он меня сперва не понял, долго смотрел и не понимал, про какие это деньги я говорю. Естественно, что он и не воображал, что я получаю жалованье, – да и за что? Правда, он стал уверять потом, что забыл, и, когда догадался, мигом стал вынимать пятьдесят рублей, но заторопился и даже закраснелся. Видя, в чем дело, я встал и резко заявил, что не могу теперь принять деньги, что мне сообщили о жалованье, очевидно, ошибочно или обманом, чтоб я не отказался от места, и что я слишком теперь понимаю, что мне не за что получать, потому что никакой службы не было. Князь испугался и стал уверять, что я ужасно много служил, что я буду еще больше служить и что пятьдесят рублей так ничтожно, что он мне, напротив, еще прибавит, потому что он обязан, и что он сам рядился с Татьяной Павловной, но «непростительно все позабыл». Я вспыхнул и окончательно объявил, что мне низко получать жалованье за скандальные рассказы о том, как я провожал два хвоста к институтам, что я не потешать его нанялся, а заниматься делом, а когда дела нет, то надо покончить и т. д., и т. д. Я и представить не мог, чтобы можно было так испугаться, как он, после этих слов моих. Разумеется, покончили тем, что я перестал возражать, а он всучил-таки мне пятьдесят рублей: до сих пор вспоминаю с краской в лице, что их принял! На свете всегда подлостью оканчивается, и, что хуже всего, он тогда сумел-таки почти доказать мне, что я заслужил неоспоримо, а я имел глупость поверить, и притом как-то решительно невозможно было не взять.","I remember (because I remember all that morning to the smallest detail) that between us there was then a preposterous, in its real truth, scene. At first he did not understand me, he looked for a long time and did not understand what kind of money I was talking about. Naturally, he did not imagine that I was receiving a salary - and for what? True, he began to assure later that he had forgotten, and when he guessed it, he instantly began to take out fifty rubles, but he hurried and even blushed. Seeing what was the matter, I got up and sharply declared that I could not accept the money now, that they had told me about my salary, obviously erroneously or by deceit, so that I would not refuse the place, and that I understood now too well that I had nothing to receive because there was no service. The prince was frightened and began to assure me that I had served terribly much, that I would serve even more and that fifty rubles was so insignificant, that, on the contrary, he would add to me, because he was obliged, and that he himself dressed up with Tatyana Pavlovna, but “ unforgivably forgot everything."" I flared up and finally announced that it was low for me to receive a salary for scandalous stories about how I accompanied two tails to the institutes, that I was not hired to amuse him, but to do business, and when there is no business, then I need to finish it, etc., etc. I could not even imagine that one could be as frightened as he was after these words of mine. Of course, I ended up ceasing to object, and he handed me fifty rubles: I still remember with a blush in my face that I accepted them! The world always ends in meanness, and, worst of all, he then managed to almost prove to me that I deserved it undeniably, and I was stupid enough to believe, and, moreover, it was somehow absolutely impossible not to take it.","I remember the disgusting scene that followed in every realistic detail, as I remember everything that happened that morning. At first he didn't understand and kept staring at me blankly—he didn't know what money I was talking about. Evidently he had no idea that I was to be paid a salary, and, indeed, one may wonder what I could possibly be paid for. It's true that when he recovered, he tried to assure me that he had simply forgotten about it and, very red-faced, started fishing bills out of his pocket. I realized everything now. I stood up and said cuttingly that, under these circumstances, I could not accept any money from him, that I'd probably been either deliberately or unintentionally led to believe by my family that a salary was to be paid to me so that I wouldn't turn the job down at once; however, I appreciated perfectly well now that no salary should be forthcoming since I had done nothing here to earn it. The prince became very agitated and tried to convince me that I had been rendering him incredibly important services, that he needed me to render him even more important ones, indeed, that fifty rubles was nowhere near enough to pay for them, that he planned to give me a raise because he felt he owed it to me, that he himself had made the original arrangements with Mrs. Prutkov, but that they had completely slipped his mind, oh, quite unforgivably. I felt the blood rushing to my head and declared with finality that I'd feel it degrading to be paid a salary for telling him bits of gossip like the one about my following the two train-dragging ladies for miles, that when I was hired I was under the impression that my duties would not be those of a court jester but to attend to serious business and that since there was no business to attend to, we must put an end to this, and so on and so forth. But I never imagined that what I said could cause him to look so terrified. It goes without saying that, in the end, he managed to slip me those fifty rubles and I dropped my objections to staying in his employ. I blush to this day every time I remember accepting those fifty rubles! Everything in the world seems to end in some disgraceful compromise and what I feel most humiliating is that he almost managed to convince me then that I had an indisputable right to the money, and I was stupid enough to believe him. Besides, I couldn't really refuse—it was somehow quite out of the question.","I remember (for I remember every detail of that morning) that there followed between us then a scene most disgusting in its realistic truth. For the first minute he did not understand me, stared at me for some time without understanding what money I was talking about. It was natural that he should not realize I was receiving a salary— and indeed , why should I? It is true that he proceeded to assure me afterwards that he had forgotten, and when he grasped the meaning of my words, he instantly began taking out fifty roubles, but he was flustered and turned crimson. Seeing how things stood, I got up and abruptly announced that I could not take the money now, that in what I had been told about a salary they had made a mistake, or deceived me to induce me to accept the situation, and that I saw only too well now, that I did nothing to earn one, for I had no duties to perform. The prince was alarmed and began assuring me that I was of the greatest use to him, that I should be still more useful to him in the future, and that fifty roubles was so little that he should certainly add to it, for he was bound to do so, and that he had made the arrangement himself with Tatyana Pavlovna, but had ""unpardonably forgotten it. "" I flushed crimson and declared resolutely that it was degrading for me to receive a salary for telling scandalous stories of how I had followed two draggle-tails to the 'institutions,' that I had not been engaged to amuse him but to do work, and that if there was no work I must stop it, and so on, and so on. I could never have imagined that anyone could have been so scared as he was by my words. Of course it ended in my ceasing to protest, and his somehow pressing the fifty roubles into my hand: to this day I recall with a blush that I took it. Everything in the world always ends in meanness, and what was worst of all, he somehow succeeded in almost proving to me that I had unmistakably earned the money, and I was so stupid as to believe it, and so it was absolutely impossible to avoid taking it."

Есть очень досадные люди на свете.","I asked him to leave me alone, dissuaded by a headache. He instantly satisfied me, without even finishing the sentence, and not only without the slightest touchiness, but almost with pleasure, mysteriously waving his hand and as if pronouncing: “I understand, sir, I understand,” and at least he didn’t say this, but he left the room went out on tiptoe, gave himself this pleasure.

He immediately fell in with my request, even breaking off in the middle of a sentence, and not only without the slightest sign of huffiness, but almost with pleasure, waving his hand mysteriously, as though to say, ""I understand, I understand,"" and though he did not actually say this he could not resist the satisfaction of walking out of the room on tiptoe.

"Мне скажут: все это мечты, вы не знаете улицы, и вас с первого шага надуют. Но я имею волю и характер, а уличная наука есть наука, как и всякая, она дается упорству, вниманию и способностям. В гимназии я до самого седьмого класса был из первых, я был очень хорош в математике. Ну можно ли до такой кумирной степени превозносить опыт и уличную науку, чтобы непременно предсказывать неудачу! Это всегда только те говорят, которые никогда никакого опыта ни в чем не делали, никакой жизни не начинали и прозябали на готовом. «Один расшиб нос, так непременно и другой расшибет его». Нет, не расшибу. У меня характер, и при внимании я всему выучусь. Ну есть ли возможность представить себе, что при беспрерывном упорстве, при беспрерывной зоркости взгляда и беспрерывном обдумывании и расчете, при беспредельной деятельности и беготне, вы не дойдете наконец до знания, как ежедневно нажить лишний двугривенный? Главное, я порешил никогда не бить на максимум барыша, а всегда быть спокойным. Там, дальше, уже нажив тысячу и другую, я бы, конечно, и невольно вышел из факторства и уличного перекупства. Мне, конечно, слишком мало еще известны биржа, акции, банкирское дело и все прочее. Но, взамен того, мне известно как пять моих пальцев, что все эти биржи и банкирства я узнаю и изучу в свое время, как никто другой, и что наука эта явится совершенно просто, потому только, что до этого дойдет дело. Ума, что ли, тут так много надо? Что за Соломонова такая премудрость! Был бы только характер; уменье, ловкость, знание придут сами собою. Только бы не переставалось «хотеть».","They will tell me: all these are dreams, you do not know the streets, and you will be fooled from the first step. But I have will and character, and street science is a science, like any other, it is given to perseverance, attention and abilities. In the gymnasium, I was one of the first until the seventh grade, I was very good at mathematics. Well, is it possible to exalt experience and street science to such an idol level in order to certainly predict failure! This is always said only by those who have never had any experience in anything, have never begun any life and vegetate on the ready. “One broke his nose, so the other will certainly break it.” No, I won't break it. I have a character, and with attention I will learn everything. Well, is it possible to imagine that with unceasing perseverance, with uninterrupted vigilance of the eye and incessant reflection and calculation, with boundless activity and running around, you will not finally reach the knowledge of how to amass an extra two-kopeck piece every day? The main thing is that I decided never to beat the maximum profit, but always be calm. There, further, having already made a thousand and another, I would, of course, unwittingly get out of factoring and street buying. Of course, I still know too little about the stock exchange, stocks, banking and everything else. But, in return, I know like my five fingers that I will learn and study all these stock exchanges and banking in due time, like no one else, and that this science will appear quite simply, only because it comes to this. Uma, is there so much needed here? What kind of Solomon's wisdom! There would be only character; skill, dexterity, knowledge will come by themselves. Just don't stop wanting.","You may object that this is all pipe dreams, that I know nothing about the streets, and that on the very first day they'll make a fool out of me. My answer is that I have character and will, and that the science of survival in the streets is a science like any other and can, therefore, be mastered by anyone with enough perseverance, concentration, and ability. At high school I was just about at the top of my class until my third year and I was especially good at math. So I don't think there's any justification to making a fetish out of experience, presenting the science of survival in the street as an insurmountable difficulty and predicting my failure on those grounds. That's only what people say who have never tried anything, who have never even started to live, and who have grown stiff from sitting motionless amidst things as they found them. ""Somebody tried that before and got a bloody nose,"" they reason, ""so if somebody else tries it, he'll get his nose bloodied too."" But I won't, not me! I have will power and, if I concentrate hard enough, I can learn anything. Do you really imagine that a man, endowed with relentless energy, who's always on the alert, who's always thinking and calculating, who's always on the go, watching for an opportunity, that such a man won't acquire enough know-how to earn every day, say, twenty kopeks more than he spends on his upkeep? Above all, I resolved never to go all out for a maximum immediate gain, but always to remain cool. Later, of course, after I'd saved a thousand or two, I'd graduate from secondhand dealing and street peddling. Right now I still know too little about the stock exchange, shares, the banking business, and the whole world of high finance. But what I do know, as well as I know I have fingers on each hand, is that, when the time comes, I'll learn everything about the stock exchange, banking, and all that, and I'll get a clearer picture of it than anybody else simply because I'll have reached a point when I'll have to master that science too. Why, it doesn't take all that much intelligence to master these things; you don't have to have Solomon's wisdom. All it takes is will power; the grasp, the skill, and the know-how will come by themselves. Everything will be all right as long as the desire is there.","I shall be told that ""all this is a dream, you don't know the streets, and you'll be taken in at the first step."" But I have will and character, and the science of the streets is a science like any other: persistence, attention and capacity can conquer it. In the grammar school right up to the seventh form I was one of the first; I was very good at mathematics. Why, can one possibly exaggerate the value of experience and knowledge of the streets to such a fantastic pitch as to predict my failure for certain? That is only what people say who have never made an experiment in anything, have never begun any sort of life, but have grown stiff in second-hand stagnation. "" One man breaks his nose, so another must break his."" No, I won't break mine. I have character and if I pay attention I can learn anything. But is it possible to imagine that with constant persistence, with incessant vigilance, and continual calculation and reflection, with perpetual activity and alertness one could fail to find out how to make twenty kopecks to spare every day? Above all I resolved not to struggle for the maximum profit, but always to keep calm. As time went on after heaping up one or two thousand I should, of course, naturally rise above second-hand dealing and street trading. I know, of course, far too little as yet about the stock exchange, about shares, banking and all that sort of thing. But to make up for that I know, as I know I have five fingers on my hand, that I should learn all the stock exchange and banking business as well as anyone else, and that the subject would turn out to be perfectly simple, because one is brought to it by practice. What need is there of the wisdom of Solomon so long as one has character; efficiency, skill and knowledge come of themselves. If only one does not leave off ""willing."""
"Когда я выговорил про даму, что «она была прекрасна собою, как вы», то я тут схитрил: я сделал вид, что у меня вырвалось нечаянно, так что как будто я и не заметил; я очень знал, что такая «вырвавшаяся» похвала оценится выше женщиной, чем какой угодно вылощенный комплимент.

Yes, and I invented this lady: I didn’t know any in Moscow; I only want to praise Anna Andreevna and please her.","When I mentioned the Moscow lady who was ""almost as beautiful"" as Anna, I tried to make it sound as if these words had slipped unthinkingly from my lips, assuming that such a ""spontaneous"" compliment would be more appreciated by a woman than carefully thought-up praise.

So there was a point in my having invented that ""Moscow lady,"" for it goes without saying that she never really existed.","When I said of this Moscow lady that ""she was as handsome as you "" I was not quite ingenuous.

And though Anna Andreyevna might flush, I knew that it pleased her.

"И вышел. Я остался один; ходил по комнате и думал. Странно, он мне и нравился и ужасно не нравился. Было что-то такое, чего бы я и сам не сумел назвать, но что-то отталкивающее. «Если он ни капли не смеется надо мной, то, без сомнения, он ужасно прямодушен; но если б он надо мной смеялся, то… может быть, казался бы мне тогда умнее…» – странно как-то подумал я. Я подошел к столу и еще раз прочел письмо к Версилову. Завлекшись, даже забыл о времени, и когда очнулся, то вдруг заметил, что князева минутка, бесспорно, продолжается уже целую четверть часа. Это меня немножко взволновало; я еще раз прошелся взад и вперед, наконец взял шляпу и, помню, решился выйти, с тем чтоб, встретив кого-нибудь, послать за князем, а когда он придет, то прямо проститься с ним, уверив, что у меня дела и ждать больше не могу. Мне казалось, что так будет всего приличнее, потому что меня капельку мучила мысль, что он, оставляя меня так надолго, поступает со мной небрежно.","And left. I was left alone; walked around the room and thought. Strange, I liked him and disliked him terribly. There was something that I could not name myself, but something repulsive. “If he does not laugh at me a bit, then, no doubt, he is terribly straightforward; but if he had laughed at me, then… perhaps he would have seemed smarter to me then…” I somehow thought strangely. I went up to the table and read the letter to Versilov once more. Enticed, he even forgot about the time, and when he woke up, he suddenly noticed that the prince's minute, no doubt, had been going on for a whole quarter of an hour. This excited me a little; I walked back and forth again, finally took my hat and, I remember, decided to go out, so that, having met someone, send for the prince, and when he came, then directly say goodbye to him, assuring me that I had business and wait I can not anymore. It seemed to me that this would be the most proper thing, because I was a little tormented by the thought that he, leaving me for so long, was treating me carelessly.","He went out and, left alone, I paced the room, thinking. Strangely enough, I both liked and intensely disliked this man. There was something in him that strongly repelled me, but I couldn't put my finger on it. ""If he doesn't find me in the least ridiculous, he must be quite guileless; but if he's laughing at me, then . . . then I'd find him more intelligent,"" was the odd conclusion I finally came to. I went to the desk, reread Versilov's note, and again got lost in my thoughts. Suddenly I realized that Sergei's ""moment"" must have lasted a quarter of an hour already. I got worried, I walked up and down the room once more; then I picked up my hat and was about to walk out, expecting to meet a servant in the passage, send him to tell his master I was leaving, and when Sergei came, say good-by to him immediately because I could not wait any longer. I thought that, under the circumstances, this would be the most dignified thing to do, as I felt he was taking me too much for granted in making me wait such a long time.","And he went out. I was left alone; I walked up and down the room, thinking. Strange to say, he attracted me and at the same time repelled me intensely. There was something in him for which I could not find a name, though it was very repellent. ""If he isn't laughing at me he certainly must be very guileless, but if he has been laughing at me then … perhaps I should think him cleverer… . "" I thought rather oddly. I went up to the table, and read the letter to Versilov once more. In my abstraction I didn't notice the time, but when I roused myself I found that the prince's minute had lasted at least a quarter of an hour. This disturbed me a little; I walked up and down once more, at last I took my hat and decided, I remember, to go out to try and find some one to send to Prince Sergay, and when he came, to say good-bye to him at once, declaring that I had work to do and could stay no longer. I fancied that that would be the most suitable thing to do, for I was rather tormented by the idea that he was treating me very casually in leaving me so long."

I rise and look: a man in a rich bearskin coat, in a sable hat, with black eyes, with jet-black dandy whiskers, with a hooked nose, with white teeth bared at me, white, ruddy, face like a mask.

He had black eyes and dashing pitch-black sideburns; his gleaming white teeth were bared as he grinned at me from under his aquiline nose; his complexion was pink and white and made his face look like a mask. . . . Then he leaned very low over me and I could see the steam spurting out of his mouth with every breath.","It was bright daylight, and the snow on the wall was glistening with hoarfrost… .

"Он жил в маленькой квартире, в две комнаты, совершенным особняком, а в настоящую минуту, только что воротившись, был даже и без прислуги. Чемодан был хоть и раскрыт, но не убран, вещи валялись на стульях, а на столе, перед диваном, разложены были: саквояж, дорожная шкатулка, револьвер и проч. Войдя, Крафт был в чрезвычайной задумчивости, как бы забыв обо мне вовсе; он, может быть, и не заметил, что я с ним не разговаривал дорогой. Он тотчас же что-то принялся искать, но, взглянув мимоходом в зеркало, остановился и целую минуту пристально рассматривал свое лицо. Я хоть и заметил эту особенность (а потом слишком все припомнил), но я был грустен и очень смущен. Я был не в силах сосредоточиться. Одно мгновение мне вдруг захотелось взять и уйти и так оставить все дела навсегда. Да и что такое были все эти дела в сущности? Не одной ли напускной на себя заботой? Я приходил в отчаяние, что трачу мою энергию, может быть, на недостойные пустяки из одной чувствительности, тогда как сам имею перед собой энергическую задачу. А между тем неспособность моя к серьезному делу очевидно обозначалась, ввиду того, что случилось у Дергачева.","He lived in a small two-room apartment, a perfect mansion, and at the present moment, having just returned, was even without a servant. Although the suitcase was open, it was not removed, things were lying on the chairs, and on the table, in front of the sofa, were laid out: a bag, a travel box, a revolver, and so on. Entering, Kraft was in extreme thoughtfulness, as if forgetting about me altogether; perhaps he didn't even notice that I didn't talk to him on the way. He immediately began to look for something, but, glancing casually in the mirror, he stopped and for a whole minute studied his face intently. Although I noticed this feature (and then remembered everything too much), I was sad and very embarrassed. I was unable to concentrate. For a moment, I suddenly wanted to take it and leave, and so leave all things forever. And what were all these things in essence? Isn't it just a pretense of concern? I came to despair that I was wasting my energy, perhaps, on unworthy trifles from mere sensitivity, while I myself had an energetic task before me. Meanwhile, my incapacity for a serious matter was evidently indicated in view of what had happened at Dergachev's.","Kraft had a small two-room apartment in Petersburg and, as he had just returned to the city, he was all alone in it, without even a servant. His trunk stood there half unpacked with his belongings strewn around on chairs and on the table; next to the sofa lay a small traveling bag, a briefcase, a revolver, and various other items. As we entered, Kraft was so completely absorbed in his thoughts that he seemed to have forgotten all about me. Come to think of it, he probably hadn't even noticed that I hadn't said a word to him on the way. He started searching for something right away, but when, passing in front of a mirror, he caught sight of his reflection, he stopped and for a full minute stared at his own face. Although this did strike me as rather peculiar (and later I thought about it a great deal), at the moment I was too preoccupied and too ill at ease to concentrate on anything. Indeed, there was a moment when I thought of getting out of there and forgetting about the whole business. And, anyway, what was this really all about? Hadn't I imagined all the things that tormented me so? The distressing thought came to me that I might be wasting my time on sentimental trifles when I should have been dealing with a difficult and grave problem. Besides, my inability to cope with serious matters had already been demonstrated by my behavior at Dergachev's.","He lived in a little flat of two rooms quite apart from the rest of the house, and at the moment, having only just returned, he had no servant. His trunk stood open, not yet unpacked. His belongings lay about on the chairs, and were spread out on the table in front of the sofa: his travelling bag, his cashbox, his revolver and so on. As we went in, Kraft seemed lost in thought, as though he had altogether forgotten me. He had perhaps not noticed that I had not spoken to him on the way. He began looking for something at once, but happening to catch a glimpse of himself in the looking-glass he stood still for a full minute gazing at his own face. Though I noticed this peculiar action, and recalled it all afterwards, I was depressed and disturbed. I was not feeling equal to concentrating my mind. For a moment I had a sudden impulse to go straight away and to give it all up for ever. And after all what did all these things amount to in reality? Was it not simply an unnecessary worry I had taken upon myself? I sank into despair at the thought that I was wasting so much energy perhaps on worthless trifles from mere sentimentality, while I had facing me a task that called for all my powers. And meanwhile my incapacity for any real work was clearly obvious from what had happened at Dergatchev's."

"Я прямо, но очень хладнокровно спросил его, для чего ему это нужно? И вот до сих пор не могу понять, каким образом до такой степени может доходить наивность иного человека, по-видимому не глупого и «делового», как определил его Васин? Он совершенно прямо объяснил мне, что у Дергачева, по подозрениям его, «наверно что-нибудь из запрещенного, из запрещенного строго, а потому, исследовав, я бы мог составить тем для себя некоторую выгоду». И он, улыбаясь, подмигнул мне левым глазом.","I bluntly, but very coolly, asked him why he needed it? And I still can’t understand how the naivety of another person, apparently not stupid and “businesslike”, as Vasin defined him, can reach such a degree? He quite frankly explained to me that, according to his suspicions, Dergachev had “probably something from the forbidden, from the strictly forbidden, and therefore, by researching, I could make some profit for myself.” And he, smiling, winked at me with his left eye.",""" he said. I asked him then point blank, but in a very detached tone, why he wanted to be introduced to Dergachev, and to this day I cannot understand how a man who doesn't seem to be a fool and whom Vasin described to me as a shrewd businessman could be so naive! For Ste-belkov told me quite unashamedly that he suspected that ""some forbidden, strictly forbidden, activities"" must be taking place at Dergachev's and that therefore, if I found out something about these activities, I could work myself into ""an advantageous position."" And he winked his left eye at me.","I asked him point-blank, and with great coolness, why he wanted it? And to this day I can't understand such a degree of simplicity in a man who was apparently no fool, and who was a ""business man,"" as Vassin had said of him!

And with a grin he winked at me with his left eye."
"Просить жалованья мне и потому было досадно, что я уже положил отказаться от должности, предчувствуя, что принужден буду удалиться и отсюда, по неминуемым обстоятельствам. Проснувшись в то утро и одеваясь у себя наверху в каморке, я почувствовал, что у меня забилось сердце, и хоть я плевался, но, входя в дом князя, я снова почувствовал то же волнение: в это утро должна была прибыть сюда та особа, женщина, от прибытия которой я ждал разъяснения всего, что меня мучило! Это именно была дочь князя, та генеральша Ахмакова, молодая вдова, о которой я уже говорил и которая была в жестокой вражде с Версиловым. Наконец я написал это имя! Ее я, конечно, никогда не видал, да и представить не мог, как буду с ней говорить, и буду ли; но мне представлялось (может быть, и на достаточных основаниях), что с ее приездом рассеется и мрак, окружавший в моих глазах Версилова. Твердым я оставаться не мог: было ужасно досадно, что с первого же шагу я так малодушен и неловок; было ужасно любопытно, а главное, противно, – целых три впечатления. Я помню весь тот день наизусть!","It was annoying for me to ask for a salary, and therefore I had already decided to give up my post, foreseeing that I would be forced to leave this place too, due to unavoidable circumstances. Waking up that morning and getting dressed in my closet upstairs, I felt my heart pounding, and although I spat, but, entering the prince’s house, I again felt the same excitement: this morning that person was supposed to arrive here, woman, from whose arrival I expected an explanation of everything that tormented me! It was precisely the prince's daughter, that general's wife Akhmakova, the young widow of whom I have already spoken and who was in a fierce enmity with Versilov. Finally I wrote this name! Of course, I never saw her, and I could not even imagine how I would talk to her, and whether I would; but it seemed to me (perhaps on sufficient grounds) that with her arrival the darkness that surrounded Versilov in my eyes would also dissipate. I could not remain firm: it was terribly annoying that from the very first step I was so cowardly and awkward; I was terribly curious, and most importantly, disgusting - three whole impressions. I remember that whole day by heart!","It annoyed me also to ask for my salary because I had decided to give up my job, expecting that I'd have to leave the house through unavoidable circumstances. When I got up that morning and was dressing in my little garret, my heart pounded wildly in my chest. I tried to dismiss my excitement scornfully, but it only increased as I entered Prince Sokolsky's house: that was the morning when the person for whom I had been waiting was supposed to arrive , that woman whose presence could provide the answers to all my questions, I mean the prince's daughter, the young widow of General Akhmakov, whom I mentioned before and who was now engaged in a bitter feud with Versilov. At last I've been able to force myself to write down that name! I had, of course, never seen her before and I couldn't imagine how I'd talk to her, if I were to talk to her at all. However, I felt, perhaps for good reason, that with her arrival some of the mystery Versilov presented to me would be cleared up. But, try as hard as I would, I couldn't remain detached. I was furious with myself for showing such weakness and awkwardness from the outset; I felt overcome by curiosity and even more by disgust—all at the same time. I still remember, detail by detail, everything about that day!","It was annoying to me to have to ask for my salary because I had already decided to give up my situation, foreseeing that I should be obliged through unavoidable circumstances to go away.

That morning there was expected a woman, whose presence I was reckoning upon for the explanation of all that was tormenting me! This was the prince's daughter, the young widow of General Ahmakov, of whom I have spoken already and who was bitterly hostile to Versilov. At last I have written that name!

"Месяц назад, то есть за месяц до девятнадцатого сентября, я, в Москве, порешил отказаться от них всех и уйти в свою идею уже окончательно. Я так и прописываю это слово: «уйти в свою идею», потому что это выражение может обозначить почти всю мою главную мысль – то самое, для чего я живу на свете. Что это за «своя идея», об этом слишком много будет потом. В уединении мечтательной и многолетней моей московской жизни она создалась у меня еще с шестого класса гимназии и с тех пор, может быть, ни на миг не оставляла меня. Она поглотила всю мою жизнь. Я и до нее жил в мечтах, жил с самого детства в мечтательном царстве известного оттенка; но с появлением этой главной и все поглотившей во мне идеи мечты мои скрепились и разом отлились в известную форму: из глупых сделались разумными. Гимназия мечтам не мешала; не помешала и идее. Прибавлю, однако, что я кончил гимназический курс в последнем году плохо, тогда как до седьмого класса всегда был из первых, а случилось это вследствие той же идеи, вследствие вывода, может быть ложного, который я из нее вывел. Таким образом, не гимназия помешала идее, а идея помешала гимназии, помешала и университету. Кончив гимназию, я тотчас же вознамерился не только порвать со всеми радикально, но если надо, то со всем даже миром, несмотря на то что мне был тогда всего только двадцатый год. Я написал кому следует, через кого следует в Петербург, чтобы меня окончательно оставили в покое, денег на содержание мое больше не присылали и, если возможно, чтоб забыли меня вовсе (то есть, разумеется, в случае, если меня сколько-нибудь помнили), и, наконец, что в университет я «ни за что» не поступлю. Дилемма стояла передо мной неотразимая: или университет и дальнейшее образование, или отдалить немедленное приложение «идеи» к делу еще на четыре года; я бестрепетно стал за идею, ибо был математически убежден. Версилов, отец мой, которого я видел всего только раз в моей жизни, на миг, когда мне было всего десять лет (и который в один этот миг успел поразить меня), Версилов, в ответ на мое письмо, не ему, впрочем, посланное, сам вызвал меня в Петербург собственноручным письмом, обещая частное место. Этот вызов человека, сухого и гордого, ко мне высокомерного и небрежного и который до сих пор, родив меня и бросив в люди, не только не знал меня вовсе, но даже в этом никогда не раскаивался (кто знает, может быть, о самом существовании моем имел понятие смутное и неточное, так как оказалось потом, что и деньги не он платил за содержание мое в Москве, а другие), вызов этого человека, говорю я, так вдруг обо мне вспомнившего и удостоившего собственноручным письмом, – этот вызов, прельстив меня, решил мою участь. Странно, мне, между прочим, понравилось в его письмеце (одна маленькая страничка малого формата), что он ни слова не упомянул об университете, не просил меня переменить решение, не укорял, что не хочу учиться, – словом, не выставлял никаких родительских финтифлюшек в этом роде, как это бывает по обыкновению, а между тем это-то и было худо с его стороны в том смысле, что еще пуще обозначало его ко мне небрежность. Я решился ехать еще и потому, что это вовсе не мешало моей главной мечте. «Посмотрю, что будет, – рассуждал я, – во всяком случае я связываюсь с ними только на время, может быть, на самое малое. Но чуть увижу, что этот шаг, хотя бы и условный и малый, все-таки отдалит меня от главного, то тотчас же с ними порву, брошу все и уйду в свою скорлупу». Именно в скорлупу! «Спрячусь в нее, как черепаха»; сравнение это очень мне нравилось. «Я буду не один, – продолжал я раскидывать, ходя как угорелый все эти последние дни в Москве, – никогда теперь уже не буду один, как в столько ужасных лет до сих пор: со мной будет моя идея, которой я никогда не изменю, даже и в том случае, если б они мне все там понравились, и дали мне счастье, и я прожил бы с ними хоть десять лет!» Вот это-то впечатление, замечу вперед, вот именно эта-то двойственность планов и целей моих, определившаяся еще в Москве и которая не оставляла меня ни на один миг в Петербурге (ибо не знаю, был ли такой день в Петербурге, который бы я не ставил впереди моим окончательным сроком, чтобы порвать с ними и удалиться), – эта двойственность, говорю я, и была, кажется, одною из главнейших причин многих моих неосторожностей, наделанных в году, многих мерзостей, многих даже низостей и, уж разумеется, глупостей.","A month ago, that is, a month before the nineteenth of September, I, in Moscow, decided to abandon them all and go completely into my idea. This is how I write this word: “go into my idea”, because this expression can designate almost my entire main idea - the very thing for which I live in the world. What is this “own idea”, there will be too much about this later. In the solitude of my dreamy and many years of my Moscow life, it was created by me from the sixth grade of the gymnasium and since then, perhaps, has not left me for a moment. She took over my whole life. Even before her I lived in dreams, lived from childhood in a dreamy realm of a certain shade; but with the appearance of this main and all-consuming idea in me, my dreams were held together and at once cast into a certain form: from stupid they became reasonable. The gymnasium did not interfere with dreams; did not interfere with the idea. I will add, however, that I finished the gymnasium course in the last year badly, whereas until the seventh grade I was always among the first, and this happened as a result of the same idea, as a result of the conclusion, perhaps false, that I drew from it. Thus, it was not the gymnasium that interfered with the idea, but the idea that interfered with the gymnasium, it also interfered with the university. After graduating from high school, I immediately set out not only to break with everyone radically, but, if necessary, with the whole world, even, despite the fact that I was then only twenty years old. I wrote to whom I should, through whom I should go to Petersburg, so that they would finally leave me alone, no more money was sent for my maintenance, and, if possible, that they would forget me at all (that is, of course, if they remembered me at all) , and, finally, that I will not enter the university ""for nothing"". The dilemma faced me was irresistible: either the university and further education, or postpone the immediate application of the ""idea"" to the case for another four years; I fearlessly supported the idea, for I was mathematically convinced. Versilov, my father, whom I saw only once in my life, for a moment when I was only ten years old (and who at that moment managed to amaze me), Versilov, in response to my letter, which, however, was not sent to him , himself called me to Petersburg by handwritten letter, promising a private place. This challenge of a man, dry and proud, arrogant and careless towards me, and who until now, having given birth to me and thrown into the people, not only did not know me at all, but even never repented of this (who knows, perhaps, about the very existence I had a vague and inaccurate concept, since it turned out later that it was not he who paid money for my maintenance in Moscow, but others), the challenge of this man, I say, who so suddenly remembered me and honored me with a handwritten letter, - this challenge, seducing me, decided my fate. Strange, by the way, I liked in his letter (one small page of a small format) that he didn’t mention a word about the university, didn’t ask me to change my mind, didn’t reproach that I didn’t want to study, in a word, he didn’t put up any parental tricks in this way, as is usually the case, but meanwhile it was bad on his part in the sense that it signified his negligence towards me even more. I decided to go also because it did not interfere with my main dream at all. “I'll see what happens,” I reasoned, “in any case, I contact them only for a while, maybe at the very least. But as soon as I see that this step, even if it is conditional and small, will still alienate me from the main thing, then I will immediately break with them, give up everything and go into my shell. Right in the shell! ""I'll hide in it like a turtle""; I really liked this comparison. “I will not be alone,” I continued to scatter, walking like a madman all these last days in Moscow, “I will never be alone now, as in so many terrible years so far: my idea will be with me, which I will never change, even if they all liked me there, and gave me happiness, and I would have lived with them for at least ten years! This is the impression, I will note in advance, this is precisely this duality of my plans and goals, which was determined back in Moscow and which did not leave me for a single moment in Petersburg (for I don’t know if there was such a day in Petersburg that I would did not put ahead of my final deadline to break with them and retire) - this duality, I say, was, it seems, one of the main reasons for many of my indiscretions done in the year, many abominations, many even basenesses and, of course, nonsense.","A month earlier, that is, one month before September 19, while I was in Moscow, I made up my mind to break off with them all for good and to devote myself entirely to my idea. I have used the phrase ""devote myself to my idea"" because it expresses my main purpose in life. What this idea of mine actually is, I will have lots to say about later. During the days of my dreamy Moscow loneliness the seed of the ""idea"" appeared in my mind while I was still in the second year of high school and has never left me since. Everything else in my life became subordinated to it. Even before it got hold of me, indeed from my earliest childhood, I'd always lived in a dream world, colored by a certain special light, but, after this great and all-absorbing idea came to me, my daydreams acquired a certain unity, took on a well-defined shape, and, instead of being crazy, became rational. School, which had not interfered with my dreams, did not interfere with my idea either. I must note that I graduated from school with rather poor marks, although, until the grade before last, I'd regularly been one of the top students in my class. This drop in performance was also due in part to that idea, or perhaps, to be more precise, to the conclusions I drew from it, even if they may have been false conclusions. So it was not school that interfered with the idea, but the idea that interfered with school, and perhaps also with the university. After graduating from high school, I immediately decided to break off completely with my family and, indeed, if the circumstances required it, with the entire world, although I was not even nineteen at the time. I informed my family in Petersburg in writing through the proper channels that I wanted to be left alone once and for all, requesting that they stop sending me my allowance, that indeed they forget me for good (that is, if they ever remembered me), and finally that there was nothing in the world that would make me enter the university. I was faced with the inescapable choice: to continue my education or to put my idea into practice instead of putting it off for another four years. Without hesitation, I opted for the idea, for I thought I had mathematical proof that it would work. I hadn't seen my father, Versilov, since I was ten, although during that brief encounter he had managed to leave an indelible impression upon me. And now, despite the fact that my letter hadn't been addressed to him personally, he answered me himself, in his own hand. He asked me to come to Petersburg, promising to get me a job there. My pride was greatly flattered by this letter from that cold and haughty man, who, after bringing me into the world and packing me off to live with strangers, took no interest in me and never even gave a thought to the idea that he might have wronged me. (Possibly he was only dimly and intermittently aware of my existence because, as it turned out, it was not actually he who was paying for my upkeep in Moscow.) And now, by filling me with pride, that letter determined the future course of my life. It may sound paradoxical too that what I liked most about the letter (just a small sheet of note paper) was the fact that there was no mention of my entering the university, no attempt to persuade me to reconsider my decision and to complete my education; in short, he did not indulge in all those paternal pretty phrases that are used in such cases. I liked that, although it obviously showed him in a bad light, proving once more his lack of interest in me. So I decided to go to Petersburg. Besides, it didn't interfere with my main goal. ""I'll see what comes of it,"" I said to myself. "" In any case I'll have only a temporary contact with them, and perhaps a very short one at that. But if I see that this move, as ordinary and minor as it is, takes me further from my main goal, I'll break off with them, leave everything, and withdraw into my shell. Yes, my shell, exactly that—I'll hide inside it like a tortoise! "" I loved that comparison. ""I won't be alone,"" I kept ruminating, darting back and forth like one possessed during those last days in Moscow. ""I'll never again be alone as I've been all these awful years. I'll always have my idea at my side! I'll never betray it! Not even if I become fond of them, even if I'm happy living near them, even if I stay with them for ten years!"" Let me anticipate here and say that it was precisely this ambivalence about my plans and my goals, all of which took shape in Moscow and remained with me in Petersburg (for I don't know whether a day passed without my setting a final limit when I would break off my relations with them and leave), this ambivalence, as I was saying, that was probably one of the main reasons for the indiscretions, villainies, nastiness, and, of course, blunders I have been guilty of during the past year.","A month earlier, that is a month before the 19th of September, I had made up my mind in Moscow to renounce them all, and to retire into my own idea, finally. I record that expression ""retire into my own idea"" because that expression may explain my leading motive, my object in life. What that ""idea"" of mine is, of that there will be only too much said later. In the solitary years of my dreamy life in Moscow it sprang up in my mind before I had left the sixth form of the grammar school, and from that time perhaps never left me for an instant. It absorbed my whole existence. Till then I had lived in dreams; from my childhood upwards I have lived in the world of dreams, always of a certain colour. But after this great and all-absorbing idea turned up, my dreams gained in force, took a definite shape; and became rational instead of foolish. School did not hinder my dreams, and it did not hinder the idea either. I must add, however, that I came out badly in the leaving exam, though I had always been one of the first in all the forms up to the seventh, and this was a result of that same idea, a result of a false deduction from it perhaps. So it was not school work that hindered the idea, but the idea that hindered school work, and it hindered university work too. When I left school I intended at once not only to cut myself off from my family completely, but from all the world if necessary, though I was only nineteen at the time. I wrote through a suitable person to tell them to leave me entirely alone, not to send me any more money for my maintenance, and, if possible, to forget me altogether (that is if they ever did remember me), and finally ""nothing would induce"" me to enter the university. An alternative presented itself from which there was no escaping: to refuse to enter the university and go on with my education, or to defer putting my idea into practice for another four years. I went for the idea without faltering, for I was absolutely resolved about it. In answer to my letter, which had not been addressed to him, Versilov, my father, whom I had only seen once for a moment when I was a boy of ten (though even in that moment he made a great impression upon me), summoned me to Petersburg in a letter written in his own hand, promising me a private situation. This cold, proud man, careless and disdainful of me, after bringing me into the world and packing me off to strangers, knew nothing of me at all and had never even regretted his conduct; who knows, perhaps he had only a vague and confused idea of my existence, for it appeared afterwards that the money for my maintenance in Moscow had not been furnished by him but by other people. Yet the summons of this man who so suddenly remembered me and deigned to write to me with his own hand, by flattering me, decided my fate. Strange to say, what pleased me in his note (one tiny sheet of paper) was that he said not a word about the university, did not ask me to change my mind, did not blame me for not wanting to continue my studies, did not, in fact, trot out any parental flourishes of the kind usual in such cases, and yet this was wrong of him since it betrayed more than anything his lack of interest in me. I resolved to go, the more readily because it would not hinder my great idea. ""I'll see what will come of it,"" I argued, ""in any case I shall associate with them only for a time; possibly a very short time. But as soon as I see that this step, tentative and trifling as it is, is keeping me from the GREAT OBJECT, I shall break off with them, throw up everything and retreat into my shell."" Yes, into my shell! ""I shall hide in it like a tortoise."" This comparison pleased me very much. ""I shall not be alone,"" I went on musing, as I walked about Moscow those last days like one possessed. ""I shall never be alone as I have been for so many awful years till now; I shall have my idea to which I will never be false, even if I like them all there, and they make me happy, and I live with them for ten years! "" It was, I may remark beforehand, just that impression, that is, just the twofold nature of the plans and objects definitely formed before leaving Moscow, and never out of my mind for one instant in Petersburg (for I hardly think there was a day in Petersburg which I had not fixed on beforehand as the final date for breaking off with them and going away) , it was this, I say, that was, I believe, one of the chief causes of many of the indiscretions I have been guilty of during this year, many nasty things, many even low things, and stupid ones of course."
"А пока я все еще продолжал занимать мою квартиренку, занимать, но не жить в ней; там лежал мой чемодан, сак и иные вещи; главная же резиденция моя была у князя Сергея Сокольского. Я у него сидел, я у него и спал, и так по целым даже неделям… Как это случилось, об этом сейчас, а пока скажу об этой моей квартиренке. Она уже была мне дорога: сюда ко мне пришел Версилов, сам, в первый раз после тогдашней ссоры, и потом приходил много раз. Повторяю, это время было страшным позором, но и огромным счастьем… Да и все тогда так удавалось и так улыбалось! «И к чему все эти прежние хмурости, – думал я в иные упоительные минуты, – к чему эти старые больные надрывы, мое одинокое и угрюмое детство, мои глупые мечты под одеялом, клятвы, расчеты и даже „идея“? Я все это напредставил и выдумал, а оказывается, что в мире совсем не то; мне вот так радостно и легко: у меня отец – Версилов, у меня друг – князь Сережа, у меня и еще»… но об еще – оставим. Увы, все делалось во имя любви, великодушия, чести, а потом оказалось безобразным, нахальным, бесчестным.","In the meantime, I still continued to occupy my apartment, to occupy, but not to live in it; there lay my suitcase, sack and other things; my main residence was with Prince Sergei Sokolsky. I sat with him, I slept with him, and so on even for whole weeks ... How it happened, about this now, but for now I'll tell you about this apartment of mine. She was already dear to me: Versilov himself came to me here for the first time after that quarrel, and then came back many times. I repeat, this time was a terrible shame, but also a great happiness ... Yes, and everything then worked out so well and smiled so much! “And why all these former glooms,” I thought in certain delightful moments, “why these old sick tears, my lonely and gloomy childhood, my stupid dreams under the covers, oaths, calculations, and even an “idea”? I imagined and invented all this, but it turns out that the world is not at all the same; I feel so joyful and light: my father is Versilov, I have a friend, Prince Seryozha, I have one more thing ”... but let’s leave about more. Alas, everything was done in the name of love, generosity, honor, and then it turned out to be ugly, impudent, dishonorable.","Meanwhile I kept on renting the same small room, although I didn't really live there. It was just a place to keep my suitcase, my bag, and various other belongings. I actually lived at Sergei Sokolsky's: I spent days on end there; I slept there for whole weeks. I'll explain how this came to pass in a moment, but first I must say a few words about the room I rented. It meant a lot to me because Versilov came there on his own initiative to see me after our quarrel and then returned many times. Yes, I repeat, this period was one of great disgrace but also of great happiness. . . . Yes, everything seemed to be working out so well; everything seemed so full of promise! ""What was all that former gloom about?"" I mused during a blissful moment. "" Why all that morbid self-laceration? "" My lonely, disconsolate childhood, my silly dreaming under a blanket, my vows, my plans, and even my ""idea"" had all receded somewhere into the background. Perhaps I had invented all that, made up an imaginary world, while in reality it was not like that at all: life was easy and full of joy and I had a father—Versilov—and a friend—Sergei—and also . . . But we'll leave that ""also"" for later. Alas, while everything seemed to be founded on love, generosity, and honor, it turned out later to be hideous, shameless, and false.","And meanwhile I kept on the same humble lodging; I kept it on but I didn't live in it; there I kept my trunk, my bag, and my various properties. But I really lived with Prince Sergay. I spent my days there and I slept there at night. And this went on for weeks… . How this came to pass I'll tell in a minute, but meanwhile I will describe my little lodging. It was already dear to me. Versilov had come to see me there of himself, first of all after our quarrel, and often subsequently. I repeat, this was a period of shame but of great happiness… . Yes, and everything at that time was so successful and so smiling. "" And what was all that depression in the past about? "" I wondered in some ecstatic moments, ""why those old painful self-lacerations, my solitary and gloomy childhood, my foolish dreams under my quilt, my vows, my calculations, even my 'idea'? I imagined and invented all that, and it turns out that the world's not like that at all; see how happy and gay I am: I have a father—Versilov; I have a friend— Prince Sergay; I have besides … but that 'besides' we'll leave."" Alas, it was all done in the name of love, magnanimity, honour, and afterwards it turned out hideous, shameless and ignominious."

"Преимущественно мы говорили о двух отвлеченных предметах – о Боге и бытии его, то есть существует он или нет, и об женщинах. Князь был очень религиозен и чувствителен.

К идее этой я был довольно равнодушен, говоря вообще, но все-таки мы очень завлекались оба и всегда искренно. Вообще все эти разговоры, даже и теперь, вспоминаю с приятностью. Но всего милее ему было поболтать о женщинах, и так как я, по нелюбви моей к разговорам на эту тему, не мог быть хорошим собеседником, то он иногда даже огорчался.","Mostly we talked about two abstract subjects - about God and his existence, that is, whether he exists or not, and about women.

I was rather indifferent to this idea, speaking in general, but still we were both very much attracted and always sincerely.

But the sweetest thing for him was to chat about women, and since, due to my dislike for talking on this topic, I could not be a good conversationalist, he sometimes even got upset.","Our most frequent topics of conversation were God and His existence — that is, whether God exists or not—and then women.

"Версилов как бы боялся за мои отношения к Макару Ивановичу, то есть не доверял ни моему уму, ни такту, а потому чрезвычайно был доволен потом, когда разглядел, что и я умею иногда понять, как надо отнестись к человеку совершенно иных понятий и воззрений, одним словом, умею быть, когда надо, и уступчивым и широким. Признаюсь тоже (не унижая себя, я думаю), что в этом существе из народа я нашел и нечто совершенно для меня новое относительно иных чувств и воззрений, нечто мне не известное, нечто гораздо более ясное и утешительное, чем как я сам понимал эти вещи прежде. Тем не менее возможности не было не выходить иногда просто из себя от иных решительных предрассудков, которым он веровал с самым возмутительным спокойствием и непоколебимостью.

I also confess (without humiliating myself, I think) that in this being of the people I also found something completely new for me in relation to other feelings and views, something unknown to me, something much clearer and more comforting than how I myself understood these things. before. Nevertheless, it was impossible not to sometimes simply lose his temper with other resolute prejudices, which he believed with the most outrageous calmness and unshakableness. But here, of course, only his lack of education was to blame; his soul was quite well organized, and even so, that I have not yet seen anything better of this kind in people.","Versilov had apparently been worried about how I would behave toward Makar; that is, he didn't have too much trust in my intelligence and my tact.

I'll also admit (I believe without lowering myself) that, in this man from the common people, I'd discovered feelings and views that were completely new to me and that shed a much more serene and joyful light on the world. And yet there were times when I could not help losing my temper when faced with certain obvious superstitions which he accepted unquestioningly with the most unabashed simplicity. But that, of course, was only due to his lack of education because, spiritually, his mind was rather well ordered. In fact, I've never met anyone superior to him in that respect.","Versilov seemed to be afraid of my attitude to Makar Ivanovitch, that is he distrusted my intelligence and my tact, and he was therefore particularly pleased afterwards when he discerned that I knew how to behave with a man of quite different ideas and conceptions, could, in fact, be broad-minded and make allowances. I must confess, too (and I don't think it's humiliating to do so), that in this man of the people I found something absolutely new to me in regard to certain feelings and conceptions, something I had known nothing of, something far more serene and consolatory than my own previous ideas on those subjects. It was none the less impossible sometimes to keep from being impatient at some positive superstitions in which he believed with the most revolting placidity and steadfastness. But this, of course, was only due to his lack of education; his soul was rather happily constructed, so much so that I have never met a man superior in that respect."

"Это был один важный гость, с аксельбантами и вензелем, господин лет не более тридцати, великосветской и какой-то строгой наружности. Предварю читателя, что князь Сергей Петрович к высшему петербургскому свету все еще не принадлежал настоящим образом, несмотря на все страстное желание свое (о желании я знал), а потому он ужасно должен был ценить такое посещение. Знакомство это, как мне известно было, только что завязалось, после больших стараний князя; гость отдавал теперь визит, но, к несчастию, накрыл хозяина врасплох. Я видел, с каким мучением и с каким потерянным взглядом обернулся было князь на миг к Стебелькову; но Стебельков вынес взгляд как ни в чем не бывало и, нисколько не думая стушевываться, развязно сел на диван и начал рукой ерошить свои волосы, вероятно в знак независимости. Он сделал даже какую-то важную мину, одним словом, решительно был невозможен. Что до меня, разумеется, я и тогда уже умел себя держать и, конечно, не осрамил бы никого, но каково же было мое изумление, когда я поймал тот же потерянный, жалкий и злобный взгляд князя и на мне: он стыдился, стало быть, нас обоих и меня равнял с Стебельковым. Эта идея привела меня в бешенство; я разлегся еще больше и стал перебирать книгу с таким видом, как будто до меня ничего не касается. Напротив, Стебельков выпучил глаза, выгнулся вперед и начал вслушиваться в их разговор, полагая, вероятно, что это и вежливо и любезно. Гость раз-другой глянул на Стебелькова; впрочем, и на меня тоже.","It was one important guest, with aiguillettes and a monogram, a gentleman no more than thirty years old, of high society and some kind of strict appearance. I will preface the reader that Prince Sergei Petrovich still did not really belong to the highest Petersburg society, despite all his passionate desire (I knew about the desire), and therefore he must have terribly valued such a visit. This acquaintance, as I knew, had just begun, after the great efforts of the prince; the guest was now giving away a visit, but, unfortunately, took the host by surprise. I saw with what torment and with what lost glance the prince turned for a moment to Stebelkov; but Stebelkov endured his gaze as though nothing had happened, and, not in the least thinking of fading into the background, he sat down cheekily on the sofa and began to ruffle his hair with his hand, probably as a sign of independence. He even made some important mine, in a word, he was decidedly impossible. As for me, of course, even then I already knew how to behave and, of course, would not disgrace anyone, but what was my amazement when I caught the same lost, pitiful and malicious look of the prince on me: he was ashamed, therefore , both of us and me were equated with Stebelkov. This idea infuriated me; I lay down even more and began to sort through the book as if nothing touched me. On the contrary, Stebelkov bulged his eyes, leaned forward and began to listen in on their conversation, probably believing that this was both polite and amiable. The guest glanced at Stebelkov once or twice; however, for me too.","He must have been an important visitor as he was wearing all sorts of distinguished decorations and a family crest. He moved with the ease of a member of high society and looked extremely dignified, although he couldn't have been more than thirty. I must note here that Prince Sergei still hadn't been completely accepted by Petersburg society, despite his ardent ambitions (of which I was aware), and therefore he must have been highly pleased with this visit. As far as I could make out, they had become acquainted only recently, as a result of great efforts on Sergei's part. This was a return visit, which unfortunately had caught him rather off-balance. I saw the painful look Sergei gave to Stebelkov, who, however, did not seem in the least perturbed by it and, instead of leaving discreetly, sat down unabashedly on the sofa and started to ruffle his hair with both his hands, perhaps to emphasize his independence. He even assumed a pompously important air. In fact, he was absolutely unpresentable. I, on the other hand, even then knew how to behave and certainly wouldn't have disgraced anyone. That is why I was unpleasantly surprised when I caught Prince Sergei's pained and angry look directed at me as well: it showed that he was ashamed of me too, that he was putting me and Stebelkov on the same; footing. This realization drove me wild with indignation, so I sprawled myself out even more insolently on the sofa and started turning the pages of the book to make it clear that I didn't give a damn about any of them. Stebelkov, however, probably believing that it was the correct and polite thing to do, leaned forward and began to listen intently, his eyes almost popping out, to the conversation between Sergei and the visitor, who glanced in bewilderment at Stebelkov a couple of times. Actually, he also glanced once or twice in my direction.","It was a visitor of great consequence, with shoulder-knots and a family crest. He was a gentleman not over thirty, of high rank, and of a severe appearance. I may remark that Prince Sergay did not yet really belong to the highest circles in Petersburg, in spite of his passionate desire to do so (I was aware of this desire), and so he must have been glad to see a visitor like this. The acquaintance had, as I knew, only been formed through great efforts on the part of Prince Sergay. The guest was returning Prince Sergay's visit, and unhappily came upon him at the wrong moment. I saw Prince Sergay look at Stebelkov with an agonized and hopeless expression; but Stebelkov encountered his eyes as though nothing whatever were the matter, and without the faintest idea of effacing himself, sat down on the sofa with a free-and-easy air and began passing his hand through his hair, probably to display his independence. He even assumed an important countenance, in fact he was utterly impossible. As for me, I knew, of course, how to behave, decently even then, and should never have disgraced anyone; but what was my amazement when I caught on Prince Sergay's face the same hopeless, miserable and vindictive look directed at me : he was ashamed of us both then, and put me on a level with Stebelkov. That idea drove me to fury. I lolled even more at my ease, and began turning over the leaves of the book, as though the position were no concern of mine. Stebelkov, on the contrary, bent forward open-eyed to listen to their conversation, probably supposing that this was a polite and affable thing to do. The visitor glanced once or twice at Stebelkov, and at me too, indeed."

"Я воротился домой в ужасно возбужденном и, не знаю почему, в ужасно веселом состоянии духа, хотя в очень смутном. Но я боялся анализировать и всеми силами старался развлечься. Тотчас же я пошел к хозяйке: действительно, между мужем и ею шел страшный разрыв. Это была очень чахоточная чиновница, может быть и добрая, но, как все чахоточные, чрезвычайно капризная. Я тотчас их начал мирить, сходил к жильцу, очень грубому, рябому дураку, чрезвычайно самолюбивому чиновнику, служившему в одном банке, Червякову, которого я очень сам не любил, но с которым жил, однако же, ладно, потому что имел низость часто подтрунивать вместе с ним над Петром Ипполитовичем. Я тотчас уговорил его не переезжать, да он и сам не решился бы в самом-то деле переехать. Кончилось тем, что хозяйку я успокоил окончательно и, сверх того, сумел отлично поправить ей под головой подушку. «Никогда-то вот не сумеет этак Петр Ипполитович», – злорадно заключила она. Затем возился на кухне с ее горчишниками и собственноручно изготовил ей два превосходных горчишника. Бедный Петр Ипполитович только смотрел на меня и завидовал, но я ему не дал и прикоснуться и был награжден буквально слезами ее благодарности. И вот, помню, мне вдруг это все надоело, и я вдруг догадался, что я вовсе не по доброте души ухаживал за больной, а так, по чему-то, по чему-то совсем другому.","I returned home in a terribly excited and, I don't know why, in a terribly cheerful state of mind, although in a very vague one. But I was afraid to analyze and tried my best to have fun. I immediately went to the hostess: indeed, there was a terrible rupture between her husband and her. She was a very consumptive official, maybe kind, but, like all consumptives, extremely capricious. I immediately began to reconcile them, went to the tenant, a very rude, pockmarked fool, an extremely conceited official who worked in one bank, Chervyakov, whom I myself did not like very much, but with whom I lived, however, all right, because I had the meanness to often tease together with him over Pyotr Ippolitovich. I immediately persuaded him not to move, and he himself would not have dared to actually move. In the end, I finally calmed the hostess and, moreover, managed to perfectly adjust the pillow under her head. “Pyotr Ippolitovich will never be able to do that,” she concluded gloatingly. Then he busied himself with her mustard plasters in the kitchen and made two excellent mustard plasters for her with his own hands. Poor Pyotr Ippolitovich only looked at me and envied me, but I did not even let him touch me and was literally rewarded with tears of her gratitude. And so, I remember, I suddenly got tired of all this, and I suddenly realized that I was not at all caring for the patient out of the kindness of my soul, but so, for something, for something completely different.","I arrived home in a highly excited and—I don't know why—exuberantly gay, albeit very confused, state. But I was afraid to analyze it and tried hard to distract myself and think of something else. So I went to my landlady's room. It turned out that she really had had a frightful row with her husband. She was in an advanced state of consumption and, like all consumptives, had quite an erratic temper, although otherwise she'd probably have been a good-natured woman. I immediately started reconciling them. I went to the other lodger, an ill-mannered, pockmarked fool named Chervyakov, who was employed in a bank and whom I greatly disliked, although we got along fine because I was despicable enough to join him in taunting our landlord. I easily persuaded him not to move out as he had threatened, for I'm sure he would never have made up his mind to move out anyway. So in the end I succeeded in calming the landlady down completely and I even straightened the pillow under her head. ""My husband could never have handled everything the way you did,"" was her final irritated comment. Then I went to the kitchen and prepared two tremendous mustard plasters for her. My poor landlord was watching me with obvious envy but I didn't allow him to help and was rewarded by his tears of gratitude. But then, I remember, I became tired of it all as if it had suddenly occurred to me that I wasn't looking after the poor invalid out of sheer kindness but for some quite different reason.","I returned home in great excitement, and—I don't know why—in a very cheerful, though confused state of mind. But I was afraid of analysing my feelings and did my utmost to distract my mind. I went in at once to see my landlady: it turned out that a terrible quarrel really had taken place between her husband and her. She was in advanced consumption, and though, perhaps, she was a good- natured woman, like all consumptives she was of uncertain temper. I began trying to reconcile them at once; I went to the lodger, who was a very vain little bank clerk, called, Tchervyak, a coarse pock-marked fool. I disliked him very much, but I got on with him quite well, for I often was so mean as to join him in turning Pyotr Ippolitovitch into ridicule. I at once persuaded him to keep on the lodgings, and indeed he would not in any case have really gone so far as to move. It ended in my reassuring the landlady completely, and even succeeding in very deftly putting a pillow under her head: "" Pyotr Ippolitovitch would never have known how to do it,"" she commented malignantly. Then I busied myself in the kitchen preparing mustard plasters for her and succeeded in making two capital ones with my own hand. Poor Pyotr Ippolitovitch looked on envious, but I did not allow him to touch them, and was rewarded by liberal tears of gratitude from the lady. I remember I suddenly felt sick of it all, and suddenly realized that I was not looking after the invalid from kindness at all, but from something else, some very different motive."
"Я просто удивился на такой прием. Я решительно предполагал, что он будет хитрить, а он со мной так прямо, так по-мальчишнически прямо начал.

"Да, я сумрачен, я беспрерывно закрываюсь. Я часто желаю выйти из общества. Я, может быть, и буду делать добро людям, но часто не вижу ни малейшей причины им делать добро. И совсем люди не так прекрасны, чтоб о них так заботиться. Зачем они не подходят прямо и откровенно и к чему я непременно сам и первый обязан к ним лезть? – вот о чем я себя спрашивал. Я существо благодарное и доказал это уже сотнею дурачеств. Я мигом бы отвечал откровенному откровенностью и тотчас же стал бы любить его. Так я и делал; но все они тотчас же меня надували и с насмешкой от меня закрывались. Самый открытый из всех был Ламберт, очень бивший меня в детстве; но и тот – лишь открытый подлец и разбойник; да и тут открытость его лишь из глупости. Вот мои мысли, когда я приехал в Петербург.","Yes, I am gloomy, I am constantly closed. I often wish to withdraw from society. I may be doing good to people, but often I do not see the slightest reason for them to do good. And quite people are not so beautiful to take care of them like that. Why don't they approach them directly and frankly, and why am I bound to go to them first and foremost? - that's what I asked myself. I am a grateful being, and I have already proved this by a hundred foolishness. I would instantly respond to the frank with frankness and immediately begin to love him. So I did; but all of them immediately deceived me and with a mockery closed themselves off from me. The most open of all was Lambert, who beat me a lot as a child; but even that one is only an open scoundrel and a robber; and here his openness is only out of stupidity. Here are my thoughts when I arrived in St. Petersburg.","Yes, I'm gloomy and I always clam up in the presence of people. Perhaps I shall help people someday, but, as a rule, I can't think of any reason why I should. There's really nothing so marvelous about people to bother much about them. Why don't they come to me frankly and openly? Why should I always be expected to make the first move? That's what I ask myself. I'm a responsive person and I've proved it a hundred times by getting caught like a fool. I respond at once to frankness with frankness and become fond of someone who is open with me. And every time I react like that, they immediately take advantage of me and then reject me with a smirk. The most sincere of them all was Lambert, who beat me mercilessly when we were boys, but then he was just an unabashed thug and bully and his sincerity came mostly from his lack of imagination. Such was my state of mind when I arrived in Petersburg.","Yes, I am a gloomy person; I'm always shutting myself up. I often love to walk out of a room full of people. I may perhaps do people a kindness, but often I cannot see the slightest reason for doing them a kindness. People are not such splendid creatures that they are worth taking much trouble about. Why can't they approach me openly and directly, why must I always be forced to make the first overtures? That is the question I asked myself. I am a grateful creature, and have shown it by a hundred imbecilities. If some one were frank with me, I should instantly respond with frankness and begin to love them at once. And so I have done, but they have all deceived me promptly, and have withdrawn from me with a sneer.

"То, что пробило уже три часа, меня беспокоило. «Если мне дано свидание, то как же я опаздываю на свидание», – думал я. Мелькали тоже глупые вопросы, вроде таких: «Что мне теперь лучше, смелость или робость?» Но все это только мелькало, потому что в сердце было главное, и такое, что я определить не мог. Накануне сказано было так: «Завтра я в три часа буду у Татьяны Павловны» – вот и все. Но, во-первых, я и у ней, в ее комнате, всегда был принят наедине, и она могла сказать мне все что угодно, и не переселяясь к Татьяне Павловне; стало быть, зачем же назначать другое место у Татьяны Павловны? И опять вопрос: Татьяна Павловна будет дома или не дома? Если это – свидание, то, значит, Татьяны Павловны не будет дома. А как этого достигнуть, не объяснив всего заранее Татьяне Павловне? Значит, и Татьяна Павловна в секрете? Эта мысль казалась мне дикою и как-то нецеломудренною, почти грубою.","The fact that it was already three o'clock disturbed me. “If I am given a date, then how am I late for a date,” I thought. Stupid questions also flashed by, such as: “What is better for me now, courage or timidity?” But all this only flashed, because in the heart there was the main thing, and such that I could not determine. The day before, it was said: “Tomorrow at three o'clock I will be at Tatyana Pavlovna's” - that's all. But, in the first place, I was always received by her, in her room, alone, and she could tell me anything she liked without moving in with Tatyana Pavlovna; so why appoint another place with Tatyana Pavlovna? And again the question: will Tatyana Pavlovna be at home or not at home? If this is a date, then Tatyana Pavlovna will not be at home. And how can this be achieved without explaining everything to Tatyana Pavlovna in advance? So Tatyana Pavlovna is also a secret? This thought seemed to me wild and somehow unchaste, almost rude.","The fact that it was already past three o'clock worried me somewhat. ""How can I not be there at the time she fixed? "" I kept repeating to myself. I also asked myself such foolish questions as ""What is better under the circumstances—boldness or timidity?""

All she'd actually said to me the previous evening was: ""I'll be at Mrs. Prutkov's tomorrow at three. "" That was all. But then she'd received me before in her own place, without anybody else present, and she obviously could have said anything she wanted without having to meet me at Mrs. Prutkov's for that purpose. Also, I had no idea whether Mrs. Prutkov would be at home or not. If it was a tryst, then she wouldn't be there. But how could she arrange that without explaining to Mrs. Prutkov in advance why she needed her apartment? Did that mean that Mrs. Prutkov was in on the secret too? This seemed most unlikely to me. It would have been rather indecent, quite shocking, in fact.","The fact that it had already struck three troubled me: ""If an interview has been granted me, how can I possibly be late for it,"" I thought. Foolish questions crossed my mind, too, such as: ""Which was my better course now, boldness or timidity?"" But all this only flashed through my mind because I had something of real value in my heart, which I could not have defined. What had been said the evening before was this: ""To-morrow at three o'clock I shall be at Tatyana Pavlovna's,"" that was all. But in the first place, she always received me alone in her own room, and she could have said anything she liked to me there, without going to Tatyana Pavlovna's for the purpose; so why have appointed another place of meeting? And another question was: would Tatyana Pavlovna be at home or not? If it were a tryst then Tatyana Pavlovna would not be at home. And how could this have been arranged without telling Tatyana Pavlovna beforehand? Then was Tatyana Pavlovna in the secret? This idea seemed to me wild, and in a way indelicate, almost coarse."

"– Ламберт, – перебил я, задыхаясь и торопясь и поневоле несколько декламируя, – если я остановился с тобою, то единственно затем, чтобы навсегда с тобою покончить. Я уже говорил тебе вчера, но ты все не понимаешь. Ламберт, ты – ребенок и глуп, как француз. Ты все думаешь, что ты как у Тушара и что я так же глуп, как у Тушара… Но я не так же глуп, как у Тушара… Я вчера был пьян, но не от вина, а потому, что был и без того возбужден; а если я поддакивал тому, что ты молол, то потому, что я хитрил, чтоб выведать твои мысли. Я тебя обманывал, а ты обрадовался и поверил и молол. Знай, что жениться на ней, это – такой вздор, которому гимназист приготовительного класса не поверит. Можно ли подумать, чтоб я поверил? а ты поверил! Ты потому поверил, что ты не принят в высшем обществе и ничего не знаешь, как у них в высшем свете делается. Это не так просто у них в высшем свете делается, и это невозможно, чтоб так просто – взяла да и вышла замуж… Теперь скажу тебе ясно, чего тебе хочется: тебе хочется зазвать меня, чтоб опоить и чтоб я выдал тебе документ и пошел с тобою на какое-то мошенничество против Катерины Николаевны! Так врешь же! не приду к тебе никогда, и знай тоже, что завтра же или уж непременно послезавтра бумага эта будет в ее собственных руках, потому что документ этот принадлежит ей, потому что ею написан, и я сам передам ей лично, и, если хочешь знать где, так знай, что через Татьяну Павловну, ее знакомую, в квартире Татьяны Павловны, при Татьяне Павловне передам и за документ не возьму с нее ничего… А теперь от меня – марш навсегда, не то… не то, Ламберт, я обойдусь не столь учтиво…","“Lambert,” I interrupted, panting and hurrying, and reluctantly declaiming a little, “if I stopped with you, it was only to end you forever. I already told you yesterday, but you don't understand everything. Lambert, you are a child and stupid as a Frenchman. You keep thinking that you are like Touchard's and that I'm just as stupid as Touchard's... But I'm not as stupid as Touchard's... I was drunk yesterday, but not from wine, but because I was already excited ; and if I assented to what you were talking about, it was because I was cunning to find out your thoughts. I deceived you, but you rejoiced and believed and prayed. Know that marrying her is such nonsense that a preparatory schoolboy will not believe. Can you think that I believe? and you believed! You believed because you are not accepted in high society and do not know anything about how they do it in high society. It’s not so easy for them in high society, and it’s impossible for it to be so simple - she took it and got married ... Now I’ll tell you clearly what you want: you want to call me to get drunk and so that I give you a document and go with you for some kind of fraud against Katerina Nikolaevna! So you're lying! I will never come to you, and also know that tomorrow, or certainly the day after tomorrow, this paper will be in her own hands, because this document belongs to her, because she wrote it, and I myself will hand it over to her personally, and if you want to know where , so know that through Tatyana Pavlovna, her acquaintance, in Tatyana Pavlovna’s apartment, in Tatyana Pavlovna’s presence, I will hand it over and I won’t take anything from her for a document ...

"" I was in a terrible hurry and had difficulty in controlling my breathing. Nevertheless I detected something theatrical in my own tone. ""I told you yesterday, although you still don't seem to understand, that you've never grown up, Lambert, you stupid Frenchie. You still imagine that things are just the same between us as they were at Touchard's and that I'm still as naive as I was then. I wasn't drunk last night, it was not the wine. I had my own reason to feel excited and if I pretended to agree with you it was just a strategem on my part—to find out what you had on your mind. I was leading you on and you were taken in and poured it all out. Now let me tell you this: your attempt to convince me that you could make Katerina marry me was a stupid piece of nonsense that even a schoolboy would never take seriously. It was quite unlikely that I'd fall for it. But you did. And you could only believe such nonsense because you've never had any contact with high society and have no idea what they think and how they feel. Things are not done so simply there and it's absolutely impossible for a woman like her to just say: yes, fine, marry me off to him. Now I'll tell you what you're after: you want to get hold of me, make me drunk, get that document away from me, try to blackmail Mrs. Akhmakov on your own. Well, you're just letting your imagination run away with you, Lambert. I'm not going anywhere with you, and you may as well know that by tomorrow or at the latest the day after tomorrow the document will be in Mrs. Akhmakov's hands: it is her property because she wrote it. I will give it to her myself and, if you want to know where, I can tell you: it will take place at the apartment of a friend of hers, one Mrs. Prutkov, and in the presence of that same Mrs. Prutkov. I will give Mrs. Akhmakov the document without asking her for anything in exchange. And now, off with you, and don't ever come near me again. Otherwise, Lambert, you won't get away with it as easily as this time.""","""Lambert,"" I interrupted hurriedly, breathing hard and unconsciously declaiming a little. ""I am only stopping with you now to finish with you for good. I told you yesterday, but you still won't understand. Lambert, you're a baby and as stupid as a Frenchman. You persist in thinking that it's the same as it was at Touchard's, and that I'm as stupid as at Touchard's… . But I'm not so silly as I was at Touchard's… . I was drunk yesterday, but not from wine, but because I was excited; and if I seemed to agree with the stuff you talked, it was because I pretended, so as to find out what you were driving at. I deceived you, and you were delighted and believed it and went on talking nonsense. Let me tell you that marrying her is such nonsense that it wouldn't take in a schoolboy in the first form. How could you imagine I should believe it? Did you believe it? You believed it because you have never been in aristocratic society, and don't know how things are done among decent people. Things aren't done so simply in aristocratic society, and it's not possible for her so simply to go and get married… . Now I will tell you plainly what it is you want: you mean to entice me, so as to make me drunk, and to get me to give up the document, and to join you in some scoundrelly plot against Katerina Nikolaevna! So I tell you it's nonsense! I'll never come to you. And you may as well know that to-morrow or the day after that letter will be in her own hands, for it belongs to her, for it was written by her, and I'll give it to her myself, and if you care to know where, I can tell you that through Tatyana Pavlovna, her friend, I shall give it at Tatyana Pavlovna's, and in Tatyana Pavlovna's presence, and I'll take nothing from her for giving it her.

"Так говорю, как судья, и знаю, что я виновен. В том вихре, в котором я тогда закружился, я хоть был и один, без руководителя и советника, но, клянусь, и тогда уже сам сознавал свое падение, а потому неизвиним. А между тем все эти два месяца я был почти счастлив – зачем почти? Я был слишком счастлив! И даже до того, что сознание позора, мелькавшее минутами (частыми минутами!), от которого содрогалась душа моя, – это-то сознание – поверят ли? – пьянило меня еще более: «А что ж, падать так падать; да не упаду же, выеду! У меня звезда!» Я шел по тоненькому мостику из щепок, без перил, над пропастью, и мне весело было, что я так иду; даже заглядывал в пропасть. Был риск и было весело. А «идея»? «Идея» – потом, идея ждала; все, что было, – «было лишь уклонением в сторону»: «почему ж не повеселить себя?» Вот тем-то и скверна «моя идея», повторю еще раз, что допускает решительно все уклонения; была бы она не так тверда и радикальна, то я бы, может быть, и побоялся уклониться.","So I speak as a judge, and I know that I am guilty. In that whirlwind in which I then swirled, even though I was alone, without a leader or adviser, I swear, even then I myself was already aware of my fall, and therefore I am inexcusable. And yet all these two months I was almost happy - why almost? I was too happy! And even to the point that the consciousness of shame, which flickered for minutes (frequent minutes!), from which my soul trembled, is this consciousness - will they believe it? - it intoxicated me even more: “Well, fall so fall; I won't fall, I'll leave! I have a star! I was walking along a thin bridge of chips, without a railing, over an abyss, and it was fun for me that I was walking like that; even looked into the abyss.

Even though I was caught in a whirlpool and had no one to turn to for guidance and advice, I was fully conscious of my downfall and therefore cannot be excused. Nevertheless, I was almost happy during those two months. . . . Why did I say ""almost""? If anything, my happiness was excessive because the awareness of degradation that descended on me at certain moments (very frequent moments!) and that made me shudder inwardly—would you believe it?—intoxicated me all the more with joy! ""If I must descend so low,"" I felt, ""why not go down to rock bottom? I'm sure I won't lose my footing and I'll climb out of the pit. I was born under a lucky star!"" Or it was as if I were walking on a flimsy plank over a precipice, enjoying the very absence of guardrails and experiencing a special pleasure in glancing down into the abyss. It was risky and it was exhilarating. As to my ""idea,"" it could wait, I'd attend to it later; this was just a detour, and why shouldn't I have a little fun now and then? Well, as I said, that was precisely the weak point of my ""idea"": it allowed all sorts of detours. If it hadn't been so rigid and radical, I might not have dared to deviate from it at all.","I speak as a judge and I know that I was guilty. Even in the whirl in which I was caught up, and though I was alone without a guide or counsellor, I was, I swear, conscious of my downfall, and so there's no excuse for me.

And so happy—would it be believed—that the consciousness of my degradation, of which I had glimpses at moments (frequent moments!) and which made me shudder in my inmost soul, only intoxicated me the more. ""What do I care if I'm fallen! And I won't fall, I'll get out of it! I have a lucky star!

"– Слово «честь» значит долг, – говорил он (я передаю лишь смысл и сколько запомню). – Когда в государстве господствует главенствующее сословие, тогда крепка земля. Главенствующее сословие всегда имеет свою честь и свое исповедание чести, которое может быть и неправильным, но всегда почти служит связью и крепит землю; полезно нравственно, но более политически. Но терпят рабы, то есть все не принадлежащие к сословию. Чтоб не терпели – сравниваются в правах. Так у нас и сделано, и это прекрасно. Но по всем опытам, везде доселе (в Европе то есть) при уравнениях прав происходило понижение чувства чести, а стало быть, и долга. Эгоизм заменял собою прежнюю скрепляющую идею, и все распадалось на свободу лиц. Освобожденные, оставаясь без скрепляющей мысли, до того теряли под конец всякую высшую связь, что даже полученную свободу свою переставали отстаивать. Но русский тип дворянства никогда не походил на европейский. Наше дворянство и теперь, потеряв права, могло бы оставаться высшим сословием, в виде хранителя чести, света, науки и высшей идеи и, что главное, не замыкаясь уже в отдельную касту, что было бы смертью идеи. Напротив, ворота в сословие отворены у нас уже слишком издавна; теперь же пришло время их отворить окончательно. Пусть всякий подвиг чести, науки и доблести даст у нас право всякому примкнуть к верхнему разряду людей. Таким образом, сословие само собою обращается лишь в собрание лучших людей, в смысле буквальном и истинном, а не в прежнем смысле привилегированной касты. В этом новом или, лучше, обновленном виде могло бы удержаться сословие.","- The word ""honor"" means duty, - he said (I convey only the meaning and how much I remember). - When the dominant class dominates the state, then the land is strong. The ruling estate always has its own honor and its own confession of honor, which may be wrong, but almost always serves as a bond and strengthens the earth; useful morally, but more politically. But the slaves endure, that is, all those who do not belong to the estate. So as not to be tolerated - they are compared in rights. That's how we did it, and it's great. But according to all experiments, everywhere hitherto (in Europe, that is) with the equalization of rights, there has been a decrease in the sense of honor, and, consequently, of duty. Egoism replaced the old bonding idea, and everything fell apart into the freedom of individuals. The liberated, left without a bonding thought, lost all higher connection in the end to such an extent that they ceased to defend even the freedom they had received. But the Russian type of nobility never resembled the European one. Our nobility even now, having lost their rights, could remain the highest class, in the form of the guardian of honor, light, science and the highest idea, and, most importantly, without being locked into a separate caste, which would be the death of the idea. On the contrary, the gates to the estate have been opened with us for too long; now it's time to open them completely. Let every feat of honor, science and valor give us the right to join the upper rank of people. Thus, the class itself turns only into an assembly of the best people, in the literal and true sense, and not in the former sense of a privileged caste. In this new or, better, renewed form, the class could hold on.","""The word honor means duty,"" Versilov was saying (I can only try to reconstruct the meaning of what he said from memory). ""As long as a country is governed by a ruling caste, the nation is strong. The ruling caste always has a sense of honor and a code of honor, which may sometimes be unreasonable but which always serves as a bond for the nation and strengthens it. It is useful morally and, even more so, politically. It is the slaves— that is, all those who do not belong to the ruling caste—who must bear the burden. To make it easier for them, they are given equal rights. That's what was done in Russia and it's very good. But all available experience—that is, Europe's experience-teaches us that whenever all citizens are granted equal rights, there is a general weakening of the sense of honor and, therefore, of the feeling of duty. Selfishness displaces the old unifying principle, and the whole system breaks up into a multitude of individuals, each with a full set of civil rights. Then the emancipated individuals, left without the old unifying principle, also lose all connecting links with one another so that they even stop defending their newly acquired civil rights. ""The Russian aristocracy, however, has never resembled its European counterpart: Even now after it has lost its special privileges, the Russian aristocracy has been able to retain its superior status as the repository of honor, enlightenment, learning, and lofty ideals without becoming, as before, an inaccessible caste, which would have meant the end of the unifying principle. On the contrary, the doors of entry into this caste, which have been barely open for a long time in Russia, must now be opened wide once and for all. Let every feat of honor, learning, and heroism confer upon any citizen the right to join the ranks of our ruling caste. Then that caste will become, in the true meaning of the word, a national elite and not just a privileged caste as before. It is in this new altered form that the caste system can be retained.""","""The word honour means duty,"" he said (I only give the sense as far as I remember it); ""when the upper class rules in a state the country is strong. The upper class always has its sense of honour, and its code of honour, which may be imperfect but almost always serves as a bond and strengthens the country; an advantage morally and still more politically. But the slaves, that is all those not belonging to the ruling class, suffer. They are given equal rights to prevent their suffering. That's what has been done with us, and it's an excellent thing. But in all experience so far (in Europe that is to say) a weakening of the sense of honour and duty has followed the establishment of equal rights. Egoism has replaced the old consolidating principle and the whole system has been shattered on the rock of personal freedom. The emancipated masses, left with no sustaining principle, have ended by losing all sense of cohesion, till they have given up defending the liberties they have gained. But the Russian type of aristocrat has never been like the European nobility. Our nobility, even now that it has lost its privileges, might remain the leading class as the upholders of honour, enlightenment, science, and higher culture, and, what is of the greatest importance, without cutting themselves off into a separate caste, which would be the death of the idea. On the contrary, the entrance to this class has been thrown open long ago among us, and now the time has come to open it completely. Let every honourable and valiant action, every great achievement in science enable a man to gain the ranks of the highest class. In that way the class is automatically transformed into an assembly of the best people in a true and literal sense, not in the sense in which it was said of the privileged caste in the past. In this new, or rather renewed form, the class might be retained."""

"Вопросов я наставил много, но есть один самый важный, который, замечу, я не осмелился прямо задать моей матери, несмотря на то что так близко сошелся с нею прошлого года и, сверх того, как грубый и неблагодарный щенок, считающий, что перед ним виноваты, не церемонился с нею вовсе. Вопрос следующий: как она-то могла, она сама, уже бывшая полгода в браке, да еще придавленная всеми понятиями о законности брака, придавленная, как бессильная муха, она, уважавшая своего Макара Ивановича не меньше чем какого-то Бога, как она-то могла, в какие-нибудь две недели, дойти до такого греха? Ведь не развратная же женщина была моя мать? Напротив, скажу теперь вперед, что быть более чистой душой, и так потом во всю жизнь, даже трудно себе и представить. Объяснить разве можно тем, что сделала она не помня себя, то есть не в том смысле, как уверяют теперь адвокаты про своих убийц и воров, а под тем сильным впечатлением, которое, при известном простодушии жертвы, овладевает фатально и трагически. Почем знать, может быть, она полюбила до смерти… фасон его платья, парижский пробор волос, его французский выговор, именно французский, в котором она не понимала ни звука, тот романс, который он спел за фортепьяно, полюбила нечто никогда не виданное и не слыханное (а он был очень красив собою), и уж заодно полюбила, прямо до изнеможения, всего его, с фасонами и романсами. Я слышал, что с дворовыми девушками это иногда случалось во времена крепостного права, да еще с самыми честными. Я это понимаю, и подлец тот, который объяснит это лишь одним только крепостным правом и «приниженностью»! Итак, мог же, стало быть, этот молодой человек иметь в себе столько самой прямой и обольстительной силы, чтобы привлечь такое чистое до тех пор существо и, главное, такое совершенно разнородное с собою существо, совершенно из другого мира и из другой земли, и на такую явную гибель? Что на гибель – это-то и мать моя, надеюсь, понимала всю жизнь; только разве когда шла, то не думала о гибели вовсе; но так всегда у этих «беззащитных»: и знают, что гибель, а лезут.","I raised many questions, but there is one most important one, which, I note, I did not dare to directly ask my mother, despite the fact that I got along so close with her last year and, moreover, like a rude and ungrateful puppy who considers that in front of him guilty, did not stand on ceremony with her at all. The question is: how could she, she herself, who had already been married for half a year, and even crushed by all the notions of the legality of marriage, crushed like a powerless fly, she, who respected her Makar Ivanovich no less than some kind of God, like she - then could, in some two weeks, come to such a sin? After all, my mother was not a depraved woman, was she? On the contrary, I will now say in advance that it is even difficult to imagine being a purer soul, and so on throughout life. Is it possible to explain by what she did without remembering herself, that is, not in the sense that lawyers now assure about their murderers and thieves, but under that strong impression, which, with the known innocence of the victim, takes over fatally and tragically. Who knows, maybe she loved to death ... the style of his dress, the Parisian parting of his hair, his French accent, namely French, in which she did not understand a sound, that romance that he sang at the piano, fell in love with something never seen and not heard (and he was very handsome), and at the same time she fell in love, right to exhaustion, all of him, with styles and romances. I heard that this sometimes happened to yard girls during the days of serfdom, and even with the most honest ones. I understand this, and he is a scoundrel who will explain this only by serfdom and ""humiliation""! So, then, could this young man have so much of the most direct and seductive power in himself to attract such a pure until then being, and, most importantly, such a completely heterogeneous being, completely from another world and from another earth, and to such an obvious death? That to death is something my mother, I hope, understood all her life; except that when she walked, she did not think about death at all; but this is always the case with these ""defenseless"" ones: they know that death, but they climb.","I asked my mother lots of questions, but I didn't dare ask her the most important one. Despite the fact that we drew very close to each other during the past year, and although I was an ungrateful and ill-mannered puppy, full of self-pity ""for having been wronged,"" and didn't feel I had to spare her feelings, I didn't ask her that important question, and want you to take note of that fact. The question is this: how could she, after six months of married life, inculcated as she was with all the notions about the sanctity of marriage, she, a poor downtrodden girl, weak as a fly, worshiping her Makar like a sort of god, how could she, within the short space of two weeks, bring herself to commit such a sin? For whatever one may say about my mother, she was certainly not a depraved woman! Indeed, let me say now, it would be hard to imagine a purer and more innocent creature than she was then and has remained all her life. It would perhaps be possible to explain her behavior by assuming that she didn't know what she was doing. I don't mean that in the sense used by defense councils in court to excuse thieves and murderers, but in the sense that she was overwhelmed by an emotion, which may have a tragic and fatal effect on a simple and sensitive person. Who knows, perhaps she fell in love until her dying day with the cut of his coat, with his hair parted in the Parisian style, with his perfect French—yes, French, of which she couldn't understand one word—with the romance he sang while accompanying himself at the piano. Yes, she could have fallen in love with a man such as she never knew existed before and had certainly never seen (besides, he was very handsome), fallen in love at once, desperately, totally, with his elegant manners, with his singing, with everything about him. I understand that this used to happen to serf girls in the days of serfdom and sometimes even to the most virtuous among them. I can see that very well and he who puts it all down to the humiliating position of serf girls deserves only scorn! Yet it's strange to think that a man like that should have had in him in his young years such a direct and irresistible power of fascination to sweep off her feet and drive to perdition a girl who was so pure and who was as different from him as a creature of another species from another world. That it was her perdition, my mother must have understood soon enough, although when she first went to him I doubt that she even gave it a thought. But that's just the way these ""defenseless"" creatures are—they may feel it's the end of them, but they still go ahead regardless.","I put a great many questions to my mother, but there is one, most important, which, I may remark, I did not venture to ask her directly, though I got on such familiar terms with her last year; and, what is more, like a coarse, ungrateful puppy, considering she had wronged me, I did not spare her feelings at all. This was the question: how she after six months of marriage, crushed by her ideas of the sanctity of wedlock, crushed like some helpless fly, respecting her Makar Ivanovitch as though he had been a god—how she could have brought herself in about a fortnight to such a sin? Was my mother a depraved woman, perhaps? On the contrary, I may say now at once that it is difficult to imagine anyone more pure- hearted than she was then and has been all her life. The explanation may be, perhaps, that she scarcely knew what she was doing (I don't mean in the sense in which lawyers nowadays urge this in defence of their thieves and murderers), but was carried away by a violent emotion, which sometimes gains a fatal and tragic ascendancy when the victim is of a certain degree of simplicity. There is no telling: perhaps she fell madly in love with … the cut of his clothes, the Parisian style in which he parted his hair, his French accent—yes, French, though she didn't understand a word of it—the song he sang at the piano; she fell in love with something she had never seen or heard of (and he was very handsome), and fell in love with him straight away, once for all, hopelessly, fell in love with him altogether—manners, song, and all. I have heard that this did sometimes happen to peasant girls in the days of serfdom, and to the most virtuous, too. I understand this, and the man is a scoundrel who puts it down to nothing but servility. And so perhaps this young man may have had enough direct power of fascination to attract a creature who had till then been so pure and who was of a different species, of an utterly different world, and to lead her on to such evident ruin. That it was to her ruin my mother, I hope, realized all her life; only probably when she went to it she did not think of ruin at all; but that is how it always is with these ""defenceless"" creatures , they know it is ruin"
"Его глаза сверкали – это я ясно помню. В лице его я не заметил чего-нибудь вроде чистой жалости, слез – плакали лишь мама, Лиза да Лукерья. Напротив, и это я очень хорошо запомнил, в лице его поражало какое-то необыкновенное возбуждение, почти восторг. Я побежал за Татьяной Павловной.","His eyes sparkled - I clearly remember that. In his face, I did not notice anything like pure pity, tears - only my mother, Liza and Lukerya, were crying. On the contrary, and I remember this very well, his face was struck by some unusual excitement, almost delight. I ran after Tatyana Pavlovna.","I remember clearly how his eyes shone. There was no trace of real compassion in his expression. His eyes were completely dry. Mother, Lisa, and Lukeria were crying. Indeed, what struck me was the extraordinary agitation, almost elation, reflected in Versilov's features. So I rushed out to fetch Tatyana Prutkov.","His eyes were shining. I remember that clearly. I did not notice in his face anything like simple pity, anything like tears. The others, mother, Liza, and Lukerya, were crying.

"И надо ему отдать справедливость: до времени он себя выдержал, несмотря на горячность. Он не являлся ко мне на дом во время болезни – раз только приходил и виделся с Версиловым; он не тревожил, не пугал меня, сохранил передо мной ко дню и часу моего выхода вид самой полной независимости. Насчет же того, что я мог передать, или сообщить, или уничтожить документ, то в этом он был спокоен. Из моих слов у него он мог заключить, как я сам дорожу тайной и как боюсь, чтобы кто не узнал про документ. А что я приду к нему первому, а не к кому другому, в первый же день по выздоровлении, то и в этом он не сомневался нимало: Настасья Егоровна приходила ко мне отчасти по его приказанию, и он знал, что любопытство и страх уже возбуждены, то я не выдержу… Да к тому же он взял все меры, мог знать даже день моего выхода, так что я никак не мог от него отвернуться, если б даже захотел того.","And we must do him justice: for the time being, he endured himself, despite his vehemence. He did not come to my house during my illness - once he only came and saw Versilov; he did not disturb, did not frighten me, he kept in front of me by the day and hour of my departure the appearance of the most complete independence. As for the fact that I could transfer, or communicate, or destroy the document, then in this he was calm. From my words with him, he could conclude how much I myself cherish the secret and how I fear that someone would not find out about the document. And that I would come to him first, and not to anyone else, on the very first day after my recovery, then he did not doubt it at all: Nastasya Yegorovna came to me partly on his orders, and he knew that curiosity and fear were already aroused , then I can’t stand it ... And besides, he took all measures, he could even know the day of my release, so I could not turn away from him, even if I wanted to.","In fairness to him I must say that, despite his natural impulsiveness and hot temper, he managed to control himself until the very last moment. After he had spoken to Versilov, he never came back to the house during my illness; he did not bother me, did not try to frighten me, and maintained a completely disinterested attitude toward me. As to the possibilities of my destroying, giving away, or using the letter myself in the meantime, he ruled these out completely. From my own words he had gathered how much I valued the letter and how afraid I was that someone might take it away from me. Also, he had no doubts that it would be to him and to no one else that I would go the day I was strong enough to leave the house: Daria had come to see me partly on his orders, so he knew that my curiosity and my fears had already been aroused and reckoned that I wouldn't be able to hold out. . . . Besides, he had taken care of every detail and knew what day I was to be allowed out of the house. So he felt sure that I couldn't possibly avoid him, even if I decided to.","And I must do him the justice to say that he knew how to restrain himself till the time came, in spite of his hasty temper. He did not come to see me all the while I was ill, he only came once to the house and saw Versilov; he did not worry or frighten me, he kept up an attitude of complete independence as regards me till the day and hour of my going out. As for the possibility of my giving up the letter, telling about it, or destroying it, he had no anxiety on that score. From my words he had been able to gather how much importance I attached to secrecy, and how afraid I was that some one might find out about the letter. And that I should go straight to him and to no one else , on the first day I was well enough, he did not doubt in the least either. Darya Onisimovna came to see me partly by his orders, and he knew that my curiosity and apprehension were already aroused, and that I should not hold out… . And, indeed, he had taken all precautions, he was in a position to know what day I was going out, so that I could hardly have eluded him if I had wanted to."
"Он сел, сел и доктор. Это они говорили про Татьяну Павловну, и я еще совсем не знал ничего об этой истории. Я сидел налево от Макара Ивановича, а Лиза уселась напротив меня направо; у ней, видимо, было какое-то свое, особое сегодняшнее горе, с которым она и пришла к маме; выражение лица ее было беспокойное и раздраженное. В ту минуту мы как-то переглянулись, и я вдруг подумал про себя: «Оба мы опозоренные, и мне надо сделать к ней первый шаг». Сердце мое вдруг к ней смягчилось. Версилов между тем начал рассказывать об утрешнем приключении.","He sat down, sat down and the doctor. It was they who were talking about Tatyana Pavlovna, and I still did not know anything at all about this story. I was sitting to the left of Makar Ivanovich, and Liza sat opposite me to the right; she, apparently, had some kind of her own, special today's grief, with which she came to her mother; her expression was restless and irritated. At that moment, we looked at each other, and I suddenly thought to myself: ""We are both disgraced, and I need to take the first step towards her."" My heart suddenly softened towards her. Versilov meanwhile began to tell of the morning's adventure.","He sat down and so did the doctor, apparently eager to hear about Mrs. Prutkov's day in court. I hadn't heard anything about it yet, so I sat down on Makar's left and Lisa installed herself opposite me on his right. I believe Lisa had some new troubles that day and had shared them with Mother. Her face looked worried and irritated. As we sat down, our eyes met for a second and I thought to myself that here both of us were in a mess and that it was up to me to take the first step toward her. Suddenly I felt softened toward her. ... In the meantime, Versilov had begun to recount what had taken place that morning.","He sat down, the doctor sat down too; they were talking of Tatyana Pavlovna; I knew nothing yet of what had happened.

At that moment we exchanged glances, and I thought to myself, ""we are both disgraced, and I must make the first advances. "" My heart was suddenly softened to her.

"В самое последнее время я стал ездить на рулетку Зерщикова. До того же времени ездил дома в три, все с князем, который «вводил» меня в эти места. В одном из этих домов преимущественно шел банк и играли на очень значительные деньги. Но там я не полюбил: я видел, что там хорошо при больших деньгах и, кроме того, туда слишком много приезжало нахальных людей и «гремящей» молодежи из высшего света. Это-то князь и любил; любил он и играть, но любил и якшаться с этими сорванцами. Я заметил, что на этих вечерах он хоть и входил иногда со мной вместе рядом, но от меня как-то, в течение вечера, отдалялся и ни с кем «из своих» меня не знакомил. Я же смотрел совершенным дикарем и даже иногда до того, что, случалось, обращал на себя тем внимание. За игорным столом приходилось даже иногда говорить кой с кем; но раз я попробовал на другой день, тут же в комнатах, раскланяться с одним господчиком, с которым не только говорил, но даже и смеялся накануне, сидя рядом, и даже две карты ему угадал, и что ж – он совершенно не узнал меня. То есть хуже: посмотрел как бы с выделанным недоумением и прошел мимо улыбнувшись. Таким образом, я скоро там бросил и пристрастился ездить в один клоак – иначе не умею назвать. Это была рулетка, довольно ничтожная, мелкая, содержимая одной содержанкой, хотя та в залу сама и не являлась. Там было ужасно нараспашку, и хотя бывали и офицеры, и богачи купцы, но все происходило с грязнотцой, что многих, впрочем, и привлекало. Кроме того, там мне часто везло. Но я и тут бросил после одной омерзительной истории, случившейся раз в самом разгаре игры и окончившейся дракой каких-то двух игроков, и стал ездить к Зерщикову, к которому опять-таки ввел меня князь. Это был отставной штабс-ротмистр, и тон на его вечерах был весьма сносный, военный, щекотливо-раздражительный к соблюдению форм чести, краткий и деловой. Шутников, например, и больших кутил там не появлялось. Кроме того, ответный банк был очень даже нешуточный. Играли же в банк и в рулетку. До сего вечера, пятнадцатого ноября, я побывал там всего раза два, и Зерщиков, кажется, уже знал меня в лицо; но знакомых я еще никого не имел. Как нарочно, и князь с Дарзаном явились в этот вечер уже около полуночи, воротясь с того банка светских сорванцов, который я бросил: таким образом, в этот вечер я был как незнакомый в чужой толпе.","Most recently, I began to go to Zershchikov's roulette. Until that time, I went home at three, all with the prince, who ""introduced"" me to these places. In one of these houses there was mainly a bank and they played for very significant money. But I didn’t like it there: I saw that it was good there with big money, and, besides, there were too many impudent people and “thundering” youth from high society. This is what the prince loved; he also loved to play, but he also loved to hobnob with these tomboys. I noticed that at these evenings, although he sometimes came in with me next to me, somehow, during the evening, he moved away from me and did not introduce me to any of his “friends”. I, on the other hand, looked like a complete savage, and sometimes even to the point that it happened that I drew attention to myself. At the gambling table I even sometimes had to talk to someone; but once I tried the next day, right there in the rooms, to say goodbye to one gentleman, with whom I not only spoke, but even laughed the day before, sitting next to me, and even guessed two cards for him, and well - he did not recognize me at all. That is, worse: he looked as if with feigned bewilderment and passed by smiling. Thus, I soon abandoned it and became addicted to going to one sewer - I can’t call it otherwise. It was a roulette, rather insignificant, small, kept by one kept woman, although she herself was not in the hall. It was terribly wide open there, and although there were officers and rich merchants, everything happened with a dirty woman, which, however, attracted many. Besides, I was often lucky there. But even here I gave up after one disgusting story that happened once in the very heat of the game and ended in a fight between some two players, and began to go to Zershchikov, to whom the prince again introduced me. He was a retired staff captain, and the tone at his evenings was very tolerable, military, ticklish and irritable to the observance of forms of honor, brief and businesslike. Jokers, for example, and big revelers did not appear there. In addition, the response bank was very serious. They played the same bank and roulette. Until this evening, November fifteenth, I had been there only twice, and Zershchikov, it seems, already knew me by sight; but I didn't know anyone yet. As if on purpose, the prince and Darzan appeared that evening already at about midnight, returning from that bank of secular tomboys that I had abandoned: thus, that evening I was like a stranger in a strange crowd.","Lately I'd started going to Zershikov's gambling saloon. Previously I'd been going to three gambling houses always in Sergei's company because it was he who had introduced me to those places. In one of the houses they usually played faro and the stakes were rather high. I didn't like it there, as I realized you needed a lot of money to back yourself up and, besides, there were too many arrogant members of what is called la jeunesse doree. But that was precisely what Sergei liked: he liked gambling too, but he also liked to mingle with those swaggering snobs. I'd noticed that, although we'd arrive together, he'd always manage to slip away from me during the evening and never thought of introducing me to any of the people in his set. And he may have had a point, because I looked out of place there, like some sort of savage, sometimes even attracting people's attention. At the gaming table I did occasionally exchange a few words with those around me, but once, when I tried to say hello the next day to a fellow with whom I had not only exchanged a few words but even joked—indeed, I'd even guessed two cards for him—he acted as though he'd never seen me before or, even worse, he stared into my face with feigned amazement and passed by grinning. And so I soon gave up that house and started frequenting a certain dump, which I cannot describe in any other way. It was a sordid little place with a roulette run by a kept woman who, however, never showed up in the gaming rooms. There everything was extremely free and easy, although there was also a sprinkling of army officers and rich merchants among the customers. Everything took place in an atmosphere of squalor and dirt, which, indeed, must have held an attraction for some people. Besides, in that establishment, I'd often been lucky. But I dropped that place too after a revolting incident that occurred in the middle of a game and ended in a fight between two customers. And it was after that that I started going to Zershikov's, where again I had first been introduced by Sergei. Zershikov was a retired army captain and the tone of his establishment was quite tolerable—militarily curt, businesslike, with a fastidious observance of formalities. There were no inveterate practical jokers there or extravagant merry-makers. Also the stakes were often very high. Both faro and roulette were played. I'd been there only twice before, and already the owner seemed to recognize me. But otherwise I didn't know anyone there. Unfortunately, Sergei didn't turn up until midnight when he appeared in the company of Darzan. They had been until then in the house frequented by ""the gilded youth"" that I'd stopped patronizing. So all evening I'd felt like a stranger in the midst of an unknown crowd.","I had of late begun to frequent Zerstchikov's gambling saloon. I had so far visited three gambling houses, always in company with Prince Sergay, who had introduced me to these places. At one of these houses the game was faro especially, and the stakes were high. But I did not care for going there: I saw that one could not get on there without a long purse, and also that the place was crowded with insolent fellows and swaggering young snobs. This was what Prince Sergay liked; he liked playing, too, but he particularly liked getting to know these young prodigals. I noticed that though he went in with me he kept away from me during the evening and did not introduce me to any of ""his set. "" I stared about me like a wild man of the woods, so much so that I sometimes attracted attention. At the gambling table people spoke to one another freely; but once I tried bowing next day to a young fop, with whom I had not only talked but laughed the previous evening, sitting beside him, and had even guessed two cards from him. Yet when I greeted him in the same room next day, he actually did not recognize me. Or what was worse, stared at me with simulated amazement, and passed by with a smile. So I quickly gave up the place and preferred to visit a ""sewer""—I don't know what else to call it —it was a wretched sordid little place for roulette, managed by a kept woman, who, however, never showed herself in the saloon. It was all horribly free and easy there, and though officers and wealthy merchants sometimes frequented it, there was a squalid filthiness about the place, though that was an attraction to many. Moreover, I was often lucky there. But I gave that place up, too, after a disgusting scene, which occurred when the game was at its hottest and ended in a fight between two players. I began going instead to Zerstchikov's, to which Prince Sergay took me also. The man was a retired captain, and the tone at his rooms was very tolerable, military, curt, and businesslike, and there was a fastidiously scrupulous keeping up of the forms of punctilio. No boisterous practical jokers or very fast men frequented it. Moreover, the stakes played for were often considerable. Both faro and roulette were played. I had only been there twice before that evening, the 15th of November, but I believe Zerstchikov already knew me by sight; I had made no acquaintances there, however. As luck would have it Prince Sergay did not turn up till about midnight, when he dropped in with Darzan after spending the evening at the gambling saloon of the young snobs which I had given up; and so that evening I found myself alone and unknown in a crowd of strangers."
"– Ах, извините, а я вас было принял тоже за вчерашнего!","- Oh, excuse me, but I thought you were yesterday too!","No, sorry, I mistook you for someone else,"" he added, after having stared at him for a moment.","""Oh, I beg your pardon, I mistook you for one of the party yesterday!"""
"Теперь сделаю резюме: ко дню и часу моего выхода после болезни Ламберт стоял на следующих двух точках (это-то уж я теперь наверно знаю): первое, взять с Анны Андреевны за документ вексель не менее как в тридцать тысяч и затем помочь ей напугать князя, похитить его и с ним вдруг обвенчать ее – одним словом, в этом роде. Тут даже составлен был целый план; ждали только моей помощи, то есть самого документа.","Now I’ll make a summary: by the day and hour of my exit after my illness, Lambert stood at the following two points (this is something I probably know now): first, take a bill of at least thirty thousand from Anna Andreevna for a document and then help her scare the prince , kidnap him and suddenly marry her with him - in a word, in this kind. There was even a whole plan drawn up; they were only waiting for my help, that is, the document itself.","I now know for certain that, by the time I was strong enough to leave the house after my illness, Lambert was hesitating between two alternatives. The first was to ask Anna for an IOU of at least thirty thousand rubles for the letter, help her to frighten the old prince, then help him escape from Tsarskoe, and quickly arrange their marriage. The whole operation had been carefully thought out so that they were only waiting for my cooperation, that is, for the letter.","Now I'll make a résumé. By the time I went out after my illness, Lambert had two plans (I know that for a fact now). The first was to get an IOU for not less than thirty thousand from Anna Andreyevna for the letter, and then to help her to frighten the prince, to abduct him and to get her married to him at once— something of that sort anyway. The plan for this was complete. They were only waiting for my help, that is for the document."
"Он был смущен; он ясно видел, что теперь скандал и огласка почти неминуемы. Большого скандала, однако же, не произошло, а вышли лишь слухи. Скрыть выстрела не удалось – это правда; но вся главная история, в главной сущности своей, осталась почти неизвестною; следствие определило только, что некто В., влюбленный человек, притом семейный и почти пятидесятилетний, в исступлении страсти и объясняя свою страсть особе, достойной высшего уважения, но совсем не разделявшей его чувств, сделал, в припадке безумия, в себя выстрел. Ничего больше не вышло наружу, и в таком виде известие проникло темными слухами и в газеты, без собственных имен, с начальными лишь буквами фамилий. По крайней мере я знаю, что Ламберта, например, совсем не обеспокоили. Тем не менее Бьоринг, знавший истину, испугался. Вот тут-то, как нарочно, ему вдруг удалось узнать о происходившем свидании, глаз на глаз, Катерины Николаевны с влюбленным в нее Версиловым, еще за два дня до той катастрофы. Это его взорвало, и он, довольно неосторожно, позволил себе заметить Катерине Николаевне, что после этого его уже не удивляет, что с ней могут происходить такие фантастические истории. Катерина Николаевна тут же и отказала ему, без гнева, но и без колебаний. Все предрассудочное мнение ее о каком-то благоразумии брака с этим человеком исчезло как дым. Может быть, она уже и давно перед тем его разгадала, а может быть, после испытанного потрясения, вдруг изменились некоторые ее взгляды и чувства. Но тут я опять умолкаю. Прибавлю только, что Ламберт исчез в Москву, и я слышал, что там в чем-то попался. А Тришатова я давно уже, почти с тех самых пор, выпустил из виду, как ни стараюсь отыскать его след даже и теперь. Он исчез после смерти своего друга «le grand dadais»:[149] тот застрелился.","He was confused; he clearly saw that scandal and publicity were now almost inevitable. The big scandal, however, did not happen, but only rumors came out. It was not possible to hide the shot - it's true; but the whole main story, in its main essence, remained almost unknown; the investigation only determined that a certain V., a man in love, moreover, a family man and almost fifty years old, in a frenzy of passion and explaining his passion to a person worthy of the highest respect, but who did not at all share his feelings, shot himself in a fit of madness. Nothing else came out, and in this form the news penetrated dark rumors into the newspapers, without proper names, with only the initial letters of surnames. At least I know that Lambert, for example, was not bothered at all. Nevertheless, Björing, who knew the truth, was afraid. It was then, as if on purpose, that he suddenly managed to find out about the meeting that was taking place, eye to eye, between Katerina Nikolaevna and Versilov, who was in love with her, two days before that catastrophe. This blew him up, and he, rather carelessly, allowed himself to remark to Katerina Nikolaevna that after that he was no longer surprised that such fantastic stories could happen to her. Katerina Nikolaevna immediately refused him, without anger, but without hesitation either. All her prejudiced opinion about some kind of prudence of marriage with this man vanished like smoke. Perhaps she had figured it out long before, or perhaps, after the experience of shock, some of her views and feelings suddenly changed. But here again I fall silent. I will only add that Lambert disappeared to Moscow, and I heard that he was caught in something. But Trishatov I have long since lost sight of, no matter how hard I try to find his trace even now. He disappeared after the death of his friend ""le grand dadais"":[149] he shot himself.","He looked extremely uneasy, feeling certain that a scandal would be unavoidable now. He was wrong: no real scandal followed, although there were all kinds of rumors. Although it proved impossible to keep secret that a shot had been fired, the principal facts were pretty well kept from the public. The police released the results of their investigation, saying only that one V ***, a family man of around fifty, had suddenly declared his passionate love to a highly respectable lady, who did not happen to reciprocate his feelings. And so, in a moment of exasperation, V *** attempted to shoot himself. Nothing beyond this leaked out, and it was in this form that the report appeared in the press with only the participants' initials. I am sure, for instance, that they never even questioned Lambert. Nevertheless, Bjoring, who knew exactly what had taken place, became worried. And, to make things worse, just two days earlier he'd learned that Katerina had agreed to a private meeting with Versilov, who he knew was in love with her. That really incensed him, and he had the affrontery to tell"" Katerina that, after what had happened, he was no longer surprised at all the fantastic rumors that were circulating about her. Whereupon Katerina broke off their engagement then and there. She did so without anger but also without the least hesitation. Her notion that it was somehow ""reasonable"" to marry the man vanished like a patch of fog scattered by the wind. Perhaps she'd recognized him for what he was even before that, but it's also quite possible that the shock she had suffered radically changed certain of her views and feelings. But, again, I'd better say no more on the subject. Of Lambert, let me say that he soon left for Moscow where he got himself picked up for one of his ventures. As to Trishatov, I've been out of touch with him since that day, although I'm still trying to trace him. He vanished from sight after the death of his great friend, le grand dadais, who shot himself.","He was perturbed; he saw clearly that now scandal and gossip were almost inevitable. The affair did not make any great scandal, however. The pistol-shot could not be concealed, it is true; but the chief facts remained almost unknown. All that was discovered by the investigation that was made was that a certain V., a man passionately in love, though almost fifty and with a family, had declared his feelings to the young lady, a person worthy of the highest respect, who did not share his sentiments, and in a sudden access of madness had shot himself. Nothing more than this came out, and in that form the story even got into the papers, no names being mentioned but only initials. I know that Lambert was not troubled in any way. Nevertheless Büring was alarmed. To make matters worse he chanced to learn of the interview between Katerina Nikolaevna and Versilov two days before the catastrophe. This enraged him, and he rather incautiously ventured to observe to Katerina Nikolaevna that after that he was not surprised that such extraordinary adventures could happen to her. Katerina Nikolaevna refused him on the spot, without anger, but without hesitation. All her preconceived ideas of the judiciousness of marrying such a man vanished like smoke. Possibly she had seen through him long before, and perhaps the shock she had been exposed to had changed some of her views and feelings. But of that again I will say nothing. I will only add that Lambert made his escape to Moscow, and that I have heard he got into trouble over something there. Trishatov I have lost sight of since that day, though I am still trying to track him; he vanished after the death of his friend ""le grand dadais,"" who shot himself. 2."

"Всю ту ночь снилась мне рулетка, игра, золото, расчеты. Я все что-то рассчитывал, будто бы за игорным столом, какую-то ставку, какой-то шанс, и это давило меня как кошмар всю ночь. Скажу правду, что и весь предыдущий день, несмотря на все чрезвычайные впечатления мои, я поминутно вспоминал о выигрыше у Зерщикова. Я подавлял мысль, но впечатление не мог подавить и вздрагивал при одном воспоминании. Этот выигрыш укусил мое сердце. Неужели я рожден игроком? По крайней мере – наверное, что с качествами игрока. Даже и теперь, когда все это пишу, я минутами люблю думать об игре! Мне случается целые часы проводить иногда, сидя молча, в игорных расчетах в уме и в мечтах о том, как это все идет, как я ставлю и беру. Да, во мне много разных «качеств», и душа у меня неспокойная.","All that night I dreamed of roulette, the game, gold, calculations. I kept counting something, as if at a gambling table, some bet, some chance, and it weighed on me like a nightmare all night. I will tell the truth that throughout the previous day, in spite of all my extraordinary impressions, I kept thinking about the win against Zershchikov. I suppressed the thought, but I could not suppress the impression, and shuddered at the mere recollection. This win bit my heart. Am I born a player? At least - probably with the qualities of the player. Even now, when I write all this, I like to think about the game for minutes! I happen to spend whole hours sometimes sitting silently, in gambling calculations in my mind and dreaming about how it all goes, how I bet and take. Yes, there are many different “qualities” in me, and my soul is restless.","All that night I kept dreaming of gambling, roulette, piles of gold pieces, raking in my winnings. . . .

I tried not to think of it, but I couldn't help reliving the emotion it had aroused in me and the very memory of it made me shiver. My winning had really gone to my head. Could it be, then, that I was an incurable gambler? Well, at least I must have some of the traits of a gambler. Indeed, even now as I write I feel a certain pleasure just at the thought of gambling. I sometimes spend hours absorbed in mental calculations about stakes and chances, visualizing myself as playing and winning. Yes, I certainly have many of the traits of a gambler and my soul is an unquiet one.","All that night I dreamed of roulette, of play, of gold, and reckonings.

I suppressed the thought, but I could not suppress the emotion it aroused, and I quivered all over at the mere recollection of it.

"О Ламберте я молчу, но читатель, конечно, догадался, что я о нем слишком думал. В бреду я несколько раз говорил о Ламберте; но, очнувшись от бреда и приглядываясь, я скоро сообразил, что о Ламберте все осталось в тайне и что они ничего не знают, не исключая и Версилова. Тогда я обрадовался и страх мой прошел, но я ошибался, как и узнал потом, к моему удивлению: он во время моей болезни уже заходил, но Версилов умолчал мне об этом, и я заключил, что для Ламберта я уже канул в вечность. Тем не менее я часто думал о нем; мало того: думал не только без отвращения, не только с любопытством, но даже с участием, как бы предчувствуя тут что-то новое и выходное, соответствующее зарождавшимся во мне новым чувствам и планам. Одним словом, я положил обдумать Ламберта прежде всего, когда решусь начать думать. Внесу одну странность: я совершенно забыл, где он живет и в какой все это улице тогда происходило. Комнату, Альфонсину, собачонку, коридор – все запомнил; хоть сейчас нарисовать; а где это все происходило, то есть в какой улице и в каком доме – совершенно забыл. И что страннее всего, догадался о том лишь на третий или на четвертый день моего полного сознания, когда давно уже начал заботиться о Ламберте.","I am silent about Lambert, but the reader, of course, guessed that I thought too much about him. In my delirium I spoke several times about Lambert; but, waking up from my delirium and looking closely, I soon realized that everything about Lambert had remained a secret and that they knew nothing, including Versilov. Then I rejoiced and my fear passed, but I was mistaken, as I found out later, to my surprise: during my illness, he had already come, but Versilov kept silent about this, and I concluded that for Lambert I had already sunk into eternity. Nevertheless, I often thought of him; moreover, I thought not only without disgust, not only with curiosity, but even with sympathy, as if foreseeing something new and out of the way here, corresponding to the new feelings and plans that were arising in me. In a word, I decided to think over Lambert first of all when I decided to start thinking. I will introduce one oddity: I completely forgot where he lives and in what street all this happened then. The room, Alfonsina, the little dog, the corridor - I remembered everything; even now to draw; and where it all happened, that is, in what street and in what house - I completely forgot. And, strangest of all, I guessed about it only on the third or fourth day of my full consciousness, when I had long ago begun to take care of Lambert.","Although I've said nothing about Lambert, I'm sure the reader must have guessed that he was on my mind all too much. I did mention his name several times while I was delirious, but once I'd come out of my delirium, I became convinced that everything connected with Lambert had remained a secret and that no one, not even Versilov, knew anything about him. This reassured and pleased me at the same time, although it turned out later, to my surprise, that I was quite wrong: Lambert had already come to the house while I was ill. Since Versilov had never mentioned this to me, I thought that, for Lambert, I had vanished into thin air once and for all. Nevertheless I often thought of him, thought of him not only without revulsion and with curiosity but even with a certain sympathy; somehow I had a feeling that he could lead me to a solution to my troubles and this feeling corresponded to the thoughts and plans that were taking shape inside me at that time. To put it as concisely as possible, I had decided to give serious thought to Lambert as soon as I was able to think straight. Let me add a curious detail: I'd completely forgotten where he lived and the name of the street where it had all happened. The room, Al-phonsine, the lap dog—all these I remembered so clearly that I could have sketched them, but where it all took place—I mean in what street and what house—had completely slipped my mind. And, strangest of all, I only became aware of this lapse of memory on the third or fourth day after I regained complete consciousness, by which time I was already worrying a great deal about Lambert.","I said nothing about Lambert, but the reader will readily understand that I thought a great deal about him. In my delirium I spoke more than once about Lambert; but, recovering from my delirium and looking about me, I quickly reflected that everything about Lambert remained a secret, and that every one, even Versilov, knew nothing about him. Then I was relieved and my fears passed away; but I was mistaken, as I found out later to my astonishment. He had come to the house during my illness, but Versilov said nothing to me about it, and I concluded that Lambert had lost all trace of me for ever. Nevertheless, I often thought of him; what is more, I thought of him not only without repulsion, not only with curiosity, but even with sympathy, as though foreseeing from him something new, some means of escape in harmony with my new feelings and plans. In short, I made up my mind to think over Lambert as soon as I should be ready to think over anything. I will note one strange fact: I had entirely forgotten where he lived and in what street it had all happened. The room, Alphonsine, the lap-dog, the corridor, all I remembered, so that I could have sketched them at once; but where it had all happened—that is, in what street and in what house—I had utterly forgotten. And, what is strangest of all, I only realized this three or four days after I had regained complete consciousness, when I had been occupied with the thought of Lambert for a long time."

Он дал мне денег и обещал еще дать, но просил и с своей стороны помочь ему: ему нужен был артист, рисовальщик, гравер, литограф и прочее, химик и техник, и – с известными целями. О целях он высказался даже с первого раза довольно прозрачно. И что ж? он знал мой характер – меня все это только рассмешило. Дело в том, что мне еще со школьной скамьи был знаком один, в настоящее время русский эмигрант, не русского, впрочем, происхождения и проживающий где-то в Гамбурге. В России он раз уже был замешан в одной истории по подделке бумаг. Вот на этого-то человека и рассчитывал Стебельков, но потребовалась к нему рекомендация, и он обратился ко мне. Я дал ему две строки и тотчас забыл о них. Потом он еще и еще раз встречался со мной, и я получил от него тогда всего до трех тысяч. Обо всем этом деле я буквально забыл. Здесь я брал все время у него деньги под векселя и залоги, и он извивался передо мною как раб, и вдруг вчера я узнаю от него в первый раз, что я – уголовный преступник.","""Sit down,"" he said, and sat down in the chair opposite. - First, find out the fact: more than a year ago, that very summer of Ems, Lydia and Katerina Nikolaevna, and then Paris, at the very time when I went to Paris for two months, in Paris I lacked, of course, of money. Just then Stebelkov turned up, whom, however, I knew before. He gave me money and promised to give me more, but he also asked me to help him from his side: he needed an artist, a draftsman, an engraver, a lithographer, etc., a chemist and a technician, and - with known goals. He spoke about the goals even from the first time quite transparently. So what? he knew my character - all this only made me laugh. The fact is that I was familiar with one from school, now a Russian emigrant, not of Russian, however, of origin and living somewhere in Hamburg. In Russia, he has already been implicated in one story of forging papers. It was this person that Stebelkov was counting on, but he needed a recommendation, and he turned to me. I gave him two lines and immediately forgot about them. Then he met with me again and again, and then I received from him only up to three thousand. I literally forgot about this whole thing. Here I took money from him all the time against bills and pledges, and he wriggled in front of me like a slave, and suddenly yesterday I learned from him for the first time that I was a criminal.","""Sit down,"" he said, lowering himself into an armchair opposite mine. "" First of all, let me tell you this: just over a year ago, during the summer I was in Ems with Katerina and Lidia Akhmakov, and after that when I went to Paris for two months— well, during all that time, I was as usual short of money. ... It so happened that in Paris I ran into Stebelkov, whom I'd met before. He let me have some money and promised to give me more if, in return, I'd render him a small service. What he needed was a draftsman, an artist, an engraver, a lithographer, and also a chemist and a technician ... all this for a certain specific purpose. And he gave me a pretty good idea at the very start of what this purpose was. Well, don't you think that was quite a shrewd appraisal of my character? ... At first, though, it just made me laugh. The point is that when I was at school I had a friend who's now one of those Russian emigres, although he's actually of foreign origin. He lives, I believe, in Hamburg. In Russia he'd already been involved in a scandal—something to do with forgery of shares. And that was the man Stebelkov wanted. However, he needed someone to introduce him to that man and he decided I could render him that service. So I wrote him a couple of lines of introduction and immediately forgot all about it. Eventually I ran into Stebelkov a couple of times more, and he let me have about three thousand rubles altogether. Then the whole business literally slipped my mind. Later, in Russia, I've always given him IOU's for whatever money I've borrowed and he's always been most servile with me.","""Sit down,"" he said, and he sat down in the armchair opposite. "" To begin with, you had better know the facts; it was more than a year ago, that same summer that I was at Ems with Lidya, and Katerina Nikolaevna, and afterwards at Paris, just at the time when I was going to Paris for two months. In Paris, of course, I was short of money, and it was just then Stebelkov turned up, though I knew him before. He gave me some money and promised to give me more, but asked me in return to help him; he wanted an artist, a draughtsman, engraver, lithographer, and so on, a chemist, an expert, and—for certain purposes. What those purposes were he hinted pretty plainly from the first. And would you believe it? he understood my character—it only made me laugh. The point is that from my schooldays I had an acquaintance, at present a Russian exile, though he was not really a Russian, but a native of Hamburg. He had been mixed up in some cases of forging papers in Russia already. It was on this man that Stebelkov was reckoning, but he wanted an introduction to him and he applied to me. I wrote a couple of lines for him, and immediately forgot all about it. Afterwards he met me again and again, and I received altogether as much as three thousand from him. I had literally forgotten all about the business. Here I've been borrowing from him all the time with I O Us and securities, and he has been cringing before me like a slave, and suddenly yesterday I learned from him for the first time that I am a criminal."""
"– А! Что? Вытолкали? И поделом, и поделом! – проговорила Татьяна Павловна; я молча опустился на диван и глядел на нее.","- BUT! What? Pushed out? And rightly so, and rightly so! said Tatyana Pavlovna; I silently sank down on the sofa and looked at her.","""What? So they kicked you out? Well, you asked for it, so it serves you right!"" Mrs. Prutkov declared. I sank into an armchair and just stared at her.","Oh, I had been so insulted! ""What! Have they kicked you out? Serve you right! serve you right!"" said Tatyana Pavlovna. I sank on the sofa without a word and looked at her."
"Как ни был глуп и косноязычен Стебельков, но я видел яркого подлеца, во всем его блеске, а главное, без какой-то интриги тут не могло обойтись. Только некогда мне было вникать тогда ни в какие интриги, и это-то было главною причиною моей куриной слепоты! Я с беспокойством посмотрел на часы, но не было еще и двух; стало быть, еще можно было сделать один визит, иначе я бы пропал до трех часов от волнения. Я поехал к Анне Андреевне Версиловой, моей сестре. С ней я давно уже сошелся у моего старичка князя, именно во время его болезни. Идея о том, что я уже дня три-четыре не видал его, мучила мою совесть; но именно Анна Андреевна меня выручила: князь чрезвычайно как пристрастился к ней и называл даже мне ее своим ангелом-хранителем. Кстати, мысль выдать ее за князя Сергея Петровича действительно родилась в голове моего старичка, и он даже не раз выражал мне ее, конечно по секрету. Я передал эту идею Версилову, заметив и прежде, что из всего насущного, к которому Версилов был столь равнодушен, он, однако, всегда как-то особенно интересовался, когда я передавал ему что-нибудь о встречах моих с Анной Андреевной. Версилов пробормотал мне тогда, что Анна Андреевна слишком умна и может обойтись в таком щекотливом деле и без посторонних советов. Разумеется, Стебельков был прав, что старик даст ей приданое, но как он-то смел рассчитывать тут на что-нибудь? Давеча князь крикнул ему вслед, что не боится его вовсе: уж и в самом деле не говорил ли Стебельков ему в кабинете об Анне Андреевне; воображаю, как бы я был взбешен на его месте.","No matter how stupid and tongue-tied Stebelkov was, I saw a bright scoundrel in all his brilliance, and most importantly, it could not do without some kind of intrigue. Only then I had no time to delve into any intrigues, and this was the main reason for my night blindness! I looked anxiously at my watch, but it was not yet two; therefore, it was still possible to make one visit, otherwise I would have disappeared until three o'clock from excitement. I went to see Anna Andreevna Versilova, my sister. I had long ago made friends with her at my old prince's, precisely during his illness. The idea that I had not seen him for three or four days tortured my conscience; but it was Anna Andreevna who rescued me: the prince became extremely fond of her and called her even to me his guardian angel. By the way, the idea of marrying her off to Prince Sergei Petrovich was really born in my old man's head, and he even expressed it to me more than once, of course in secret. I conveyed this idea to Versilov, noticing before that of everything vital, to which Versilov was so indifferent, he, however, was always somehow especially interested when I conveyed to him something about my meetings with Anna Andreevna. Versilov then muttered to me that Anna Andreevna was too clever and could do without extraneous advice in such a delicate matter. Of course, Stebelkov was right that the old man would give her a dowry, but how dare he count on anything here? This morning the prince called after him that he was not at all afraid of him: indeed, hadn’t Stebelkov told him about Anna Andreyevna in his study; I imagine how furious I would be in his place.","Stupid and muddleheaded as he was, Stebelkov was obviously a life-size villain and he was certainly plotting some shady maneuver now. But the trouble with me was that I had no time and patience to stop and examine his schemes and that's what accounted for my peculiar blindness. Suddenly I remembered I had things to do and glanced anxiously at my watch. Luckily it wasn't two yet. That left me enough time to take care of a certain visit. Otherwise, in the state I was in, I'd have worried myself to death before three o'clock. I drove to see my sister Anna Versilov. I'd come to know her quite well at the old prince's, particularly during his illness. I hadn't seen the old man now for three or four days and that weighed on my conscience. And it was Anna who made up for my failure because the old prince had become extremely fond of her and had even started calling her his ""guardian angel. "" By the way, it was true that the old prince had conceived the idea of marrying her off to Sergei, an idea he had even mentioned to me several times, in confidence, of course. I'd told Versilov about this because I'd noticed that, although Versilov seemed quite indifferent to what was going on around him, he'd become attentive whenever I talked about my encounters with Anna. On that occasion, he'd remarked vaguely that Anna had lots of sense and that she could handle the delicate situation without any outside advice. It was also true, of course, that the old prince fully intended to provide Anna with a dowry. But how could Stebelkov possibly aspire to receive part of it? That morning, Sergei had shouted as Stebelkov was leaving that he wasn't afraid of him. Could Stebelkov, then, have spoken to him about Anna when the two of them were alone together in the study? I can just imagine how furious I'd have been","Stupid and inarticulate as Stebelkov was, I had seen the full-blown scoundrel in all his glory. And what mattered most to me, it was impossible to avoid intrigue in this business. Only I had not the time just then to go into any sort of intrigues, and that may have been the chief reason why I was as blind as a hen! I looked anxiously at my watch, but it was not yet two o'clock; so it was still possible to pay a call; otherwise I should have been worn out with excitement before three o'clock. I went to Anna Andreyevna Versilov, my sister. I had got to know her some time before at my old prince's, during his illness. He thought that I had not seen him for three or four days fretted my conscience, but I was reckoning on Anna Andreyevna: the old prince had become extremely attached to her of late, and even spoke of her to me as his guardian angel. And by the way, the idea of marrying her to Prince Sergay really had occurred to the old prince, and he had even expressed it more than once to me, in secret of course. I had mentioned this suggestion to Versilov, for I had noticed that though he was so indifferent to all the practical affairs of life, he seemed particularly interested whenever I told him of my meeting Anna Andreyevna. When I mentioned the old prince's idea, Versilov muttered that Anna Andreyevna had plenty of sense, and was quite capable of getting out of a delicate position without the advice of outsiders. Stebelkov was right, of course, in saying that the old man meant to give her a dowry, but how could he dare to reckon on getting anything out of it! Prince Sergay had shouted after him that morning that he was not in the least afraid of him: surely Stebelkov had not actually spoken to him of Anna Andreyevna in the study? I could fancy how furious I should have been in Prince Sergay's place."
"Сказав это, я бросился в мою комнату. Версилов побежал за мной…","Having said this, I rushed to my room. Versilov ran after me...",I ran to my room. Versilov rushed after me.,"Saying this, I rushed into my room. Versilov ran after me."
"Минутами мне как бы мечталось, что вот сейчас отворится дверь, войдет Катерина Николаевна, подаст мне руку, и мы оба рассмеемся… О, студент мой милый! Это мне мерещилось, то есть желалось, уж когда очень стемнело в комнате. «Да давно ли это было, что я стоял перед ней, прощался с ней, а она подавала мне руку и смеялась? Как могло случиться, что в такое короткое время вышло такое ужасное расстояние! Просто пойти к ней и объясниться сейчас же, сию минуту, просто, просто! Господи, как это так вдруг совсем новый мир начался! Да, новый мир, совсем, совсем новый… А Лиза, а князь, это еще старые… Вот я здесь теперь у князя. И мама, – как могла она жить с ним, коли так? Я бы мог, я все смогу, но она? Теперь что же будет?» И вот, как в вихре, фигуры Лизы, Анны Андреевны, Стебелькова, князя, Афердова, всех, бесследно замелькали в моем больном мозгу. Но мысли становились все бесформеннее и неуловимее; я рад был, когда удавалось осмыслить какую-нибудь и ухватиться за нее.","For minutes I seemed to be dreaming that the door would now open, Katerina Nikolaevna would come in, give me her hand, and we would both laugh... Oh, my dear student! It seemed to me, that is, I wanted it, when it got very dark in the room. “But how long ago was it that I stood in front of her, said goodbye to her, and she gave me her hand and laughed? How could it happen that in such a short time there was such a terrible distance! Just go to her and explain yourself right now, this minute, simply, simply! My God, how it is so suddenly a completely new world began! Yes, a new world, completely, completely new ... And Liza, and the prince, these are still old ones ... Here I am now with the prince. And mother - how could she live with him, if so? I could, I can do anything, but she? Now what will happen? And now, as in a whirlwind, the figures of Lisa, Anna Andreevna, Stebelkov, the prince, Aferdov, all of them, flashed without a trace in my sick brain. But thoughts became more and more formless and elusive; I was glad when I managed to comprehend some and grab onto it.","At other moments I lapsed into a daydream: the door would suddenly open and Katerina would walk in, give me her hand, and both of us would burst out laughing. . . . "" Oh, my nice fellow student,"" she'd say. . . . That's what I imagined, what I was longing for, especially after the room became dark. Ah, it was not all that long ago that I really had stood near her, that she really had given me her hand, and that we'd laughed together! So how could such a horrible distance have grown between us within such a short time? Perhaps all I had to do was to rush to her and explain everything. That's it: just explain everything! Ah, God, how had it happened that all of a sudden I'd found myself in a completely different world? Yes, a completely new world! . . . And Lisa? And Sergei? Oh, that was still part of the old world. . . . And now here I was at Sergei's. . . . But Mother, how could Mother go on living with him the way things were? I could ... I could stand anything, but Mother, how could she? So what would happen now? . . . And in a crazy whirl the figures of Lisa, Anna, Stebelkov, Sergei, Aferdov, and all the rest kept spinning around inside my aching head until everything became shapeless and slippery, and I was lucky to manage to hold onto anything, to recognize it.","At moments I seemed to dream that the door would open all at once, that Katerina Nikolaevna would come in, would give me her hand, and we should both burst out laughing… . Oh, my student, my dear one! I had a vision of this, or rather an intense longing for it, as soon as it got dark. It was not long ago I had been standing before her saying good-bye to her, and she had given me her hand, and laughed. How could it have happened that in such a short time we were so completely separated! Simply to go to her and to explain everything this minute, simply, simply! Good heavens! how was it that an utterly new world had begun for me so suddenly! Yes, a new world, utterly, utterly new… . And Liza, and Prince Sergay, that was all old… . Here I was now at Prince Sergay's. And mother—how could she go on living with him if it was like this! I could, I can do anything, but she? What will be now? And the figures of Liza, Anna Andreyevna, Stebelkov, Prince Sergay, Aferdov, kept disconnectedly whirling round in my sick brain. But my thoughts became more and more formless and elusive; I was glad when I succeeded in thinking of something and clutching at it."

"Я вскипел. Это была такая обида! Я всю прошлую ночь мечтал об устроенной Версиловым встрече двух братьев; я всю ночь грезил в лихорадке, как я должен держать себя и не уронить – не уронить всего цикла идей, которые выжил в уединении моем и которыми мог гордиться даже в каком угодно кругу. Я мечтал, как я буду благороден, горд и грустен, может быть, даже в обществе князя В—ского, и таким образом прямо буду введен в этот свет – о, я не щажу себя, и пусть, и пусть: так и надо записать это в таких точно подробностях! И вдруг – сорок рублей через лакея, в переднюю, да еще после десяти минут ожидания, да еще прямо из рук, из лакейских пальцев, а не на тарелке, не в конверте!","I boiled. It was such a shame! All last night I dreamed of the meeting of two brothers arranged by Versilov; I dreamed all night in a fever how I should keep myself and not drop - not drop the whole cycle of ideas that survived in my solitude and which I could be proud of even in any circle. I dreamed how I would be noble, proud and sad, perhaps even in the company of Prince V-sky, and thus be directly introduced into this world - oh, I do not spare myself, and let it be, and let it be written down it's in such great detail! And suddenly - forty rubles through the footman, into the hall, and even after ten minutes of waiting, and even directly from the hands, from the footmen's fingers, and not on a plate, not in an envelope!","I boiled over. What a terrible insult! All the preceding night I'd visualized ""the meeting of the two brothers"" that Versilov had arranged; I'd anxiously tried to work out how I should behave so as not to cheapen my personal dignity and the world of ideas I had built in my solitude, of which, I felt, I could be proud in any company. I'd made up whole scenes in which I was dignified, proud, and a little sad, and I'd hoped perhaps to meet Prince V. too and thus gain direct access to high society. . . . Oh, I'm not sparing myself: since this is how I imagined it , I'm writing it down, truthfully, exactly, with all the implications. . . . And what happened in reality? After having been made to wait for ten minutes, they sent forty rubles out to me by a flunkey, who handed me the money not even in an envelope or on a plate but directly from his lackey's fingers!","I boiled over. This was such an insult! All the night before I had been dreaming of the meeting Versilov had arranged between us two brothers; I had spent the whole night in feverish visions of the demeanour I ought to adopt, that I might not discredit—not discredit the whole cycle of ideas which I had worked out in my solitude, and which might have made me feel proud in any circle. I dreamed of how proud, gentlemanly, and sad, perhaps, I would be even in Prince V.'s society, and how in that way I should be admitted into that circle— oh, I'm not sparing myself, and so be it, for it's just such details that I ought to record!

"«Факирство, поэзия ничтожества и бессилия! – решат люди, – торжество бесталанности и средины». Да, сознаюсь, что отчасти торжество и бесталанности и средины, но вряд ли бессилия. Мне нравилось ужасно представлять себе существо, именно бесталанное и серединное, стоящее перед миром и говорящее ему с улыбкой: вы Галилеи и Коперники, Карлы Великие и Наполеоны, вы Пушкины и Шекспиры, вы фельдмаршалы и гофмаршалы, а вот я – бездарность и незаконность, и все-таки выше вас, потому что вы сами этому подчинились. Сознаюсь, я доводил эту фантазию до таких окраин, что похеривал даже самое образование. Мне казалось, что красивее будет, если человек этот будет даже грязно необразованным. Эта, уже утрированная, мечта повлияла даже тогда на мой успех в седьмом классе гимназии; я перестал учиться именно из фанатизма: без образования будто прибавлялось красоты к идеалу. Теперь я изменил убеждение в этом пункте; образование не помешает.","“Fakirism, poetry of insignificance and impotence! - people will decide - the triumph of mediocrity and the middle. Yes, I confess that it is partly a triumph and mediocrity and middle ground, but hardly impotence. I liked terribly imagining a being, precisely mediocre and mediocre, standing in front of the world and saying to it with a smile: you are Galilei and Copernicus, Charlemagne and Napoleons, you are Pushkins and Shakespeares, you are field marshals and chamber marshals, but here I am mediocrity and illegality, and still above you, because you yourself obeyed this. I confess that I carried this fantasy to such extremes that I even lost my education. It seemed to me that it would be more beautiful if this person were even dirty uneducated. This dream, already exaggerated, influenced even then my success in the seventh grade of the gymnasium; I stopped studying precisely out of fanaticism: without education, beauty seemed to be added to the ideal. Now I have changed the belief at this point; education won't hurt.","""Mysticism!"" they'd say, ""the only poetry accessible to mediocrity and impotence; the triumph of vulgarity, a substitute for talent!"" Yes, I concede, it may be a triumph of vulgarity, require no talent, and suit a mediocrity, but there can hardly be any impotence in this case. Indeed, my favorite vision was of an average man, without any particular talents, facing the world and saying with a smile: ""Listen you, Galileo and Copernicus! And you, Charlemagne, Napoleon, Shakespeare, and Pushkin! And you, statesmen and generals! Here I am, an untalented bastard, who is, nevertheless, your superior because you accept the fact yourselves!"" Indeed, I pushed this fantasy to the limit, even wiping out retroactively whatever education I had had. I felt that the more crass the hero's ignorance was, the better the picture looked. In fact, it was the daydream in which the idea was pushed to its extreme limit that changed my attitude toward learning during my two last years at high school: I stopped studying because of my fanatical belief that my lack of education would only add beauty to my ideal. Now, however, I've changed my views on that particular point and I no longer believe that education would spoil anything.","""The fanaticism, the romanticism of insignificance and impotence!"" people will pronounce, ""the triumph of commonplaceness and mediocrity!"" Yes, I admit that it is in a way the triumph of commonplaceness and mediocrity, but surely not of impotence. I used to be awfully fond of imagining just such a creature, commonplace and mediocre, facing the world and saying to it with a smile, ""You are Galileos, and Copernicuses, Charlemagnes and Napoleons, you are Pushkins and Shakespeares, you are field- marshals and generals, and I am incompetence and illegitimacy, and yet I am higher than all of you, because you bow down to it yourself. "" I admit that I have pushed this fancy to such extremes that I have struck out even my education. It seemed to me more picturesque if the man were sordidly ignorant. This exaggerated dream had a positive influence at the time on my success in the seventh form of the grammar-school. I gave up working simply from fanaticism, feeling that lack of education would add a charm to my ideal. Now I've changed my views on that point; education does not detract from it."

"Прибыв один и очутившись в незнакомой толпе, я сначала пристроился в уголке стола и начал ставить мелкими кушами и так просидел часа два, не шевельнувшись. В эти два часа шла страшная бурда – ни то ни се. Я пропускал удивительные шансы и старался не злиться, а взять хладнокровием и уверенностью. Кончилось тем, что за все два часа я не проиграл и не выиграл: из трехсот рублей проиграл рублей десять-пятнадцать. Этот ничтожный результат обозлил меня, и к тому же случилась пренеприятная гадость. Я знаю, что за этими рулетками случаются иногда воры, то есть не то что с улицы, а просто из известных игроков. Я, например, уверен, что известный игрок Афердов – вор; он и теперь фигурирует по городу: я еще недавно встретил его на паре собственных пони, но он – вор и украл у меня. Но об этом история еще впереди; в этот же вечер случилась лишь прелюдия: я сидел все эти два часа на углу стола, а подле меня, слева, помещался все время один гниленький франтик, я думаю, из жидков; он, впрочем, где-то участвует, что-то даже пишет и печатает. В самую последнюю минуту я вдруг выиграл двадцать рублей. Две красные кредитки лежали передо мной, и вдруг, я вижу, этот жиденок протягивает руку и преспокойно тащит одну мою кредитку. Я было остановил его, но он, с самым наглым видом и нисколько не возвышая голоса, вдруг объявляет мне, что это – его выигрыш, что он сейчас сам поставил и взял; он даже не захотел и продолжать разговора и отвернулся. Как нарочно, я был в ту секунду в преглупом состоянии духа: я замыслил большую идею и, плюнув, быстро встал и отошел, не захотев даже спорить и подарив ему красненькую. Да уж и трудно было бы вести эту историю с наглым воришкой, потому что было упущено время; игра уже ушла вперед. И вот это-то и было моей огромной ошибкой, которая и отразилась в последствиях: три-четыре игрока подле нас заметили наше препинание и, увидя, что я так легко отступился, вероятно, приняли меня самого за такого. Было ровно двенадцать часов; я прошел в следующую комнату, подумал, сообразил о новом плане и, воротясь, разменял у банка мои кредитки на полуимпериалы. У меня очутилось их сорок с лишком штук. Я разделил их на десять частей и решил поставить десять ставок сряду на zero,[59] каждую в четыре полуимпериала, одну за другой. «Выиграю – мое счастье, проставлю – тем лучше; никогда уже более не буду играть». Замечу, что во все эти два часа zero ни разу не выходило, так что под конец никто уже на zero и не ставил.","Arriving alone and finding myself in an unfamiliar crowd, I first settled down in the corner of the table and began to bet small jackpots, and so I sat for two hours without moving. During these two hours there was a terrible mess - neither this nor that. I missed amazing chances and tried not to be angry, but to take it with composure and confidence. It ended up that in all two hours I did not lose and did not win: out of three hundred rubles, I lost ten or fifteen rubles. This insignificant result pissed me off, and besides, a nasty nasty thing happened. I know that thieves sometimes happen behind these roulettes, that is, not just from the street, but simply from well-known players. For example, I am sure that the famous player Aferdov is a thief; he still appears in the city: I met him only recently on a pair of my own ponies, but he is a thief and stole from me. But this story is yet to come; that same evening there was only a prelude: all these two hours I sat on the corner of the table, and next to me, on the left, was placed all the time one rotten dandy, I think, from liquid; he, however, participates somewhere, even writes and prints something. At the very last minute I suddenly won twenty rubles. Two red credit cards were lying in front of me, and suddenly, I see this little Jew stretching out his hand and calmly dragging one of my credit cards. I was about to stop him, but he, with the most insolent look and without raising his voice in the least, suddenly announces to me that this is his winnings, that he himself has now bet and taken; he did not even want to continue the conversation and turned away. As if on purpose, at that moment I was in a stupid state of mind: I conceived a big idea and, spitting, quickly got up and walked away, not even wanting to argue and gave him a red one. Yes, it would be difficult to carry on this story with an impudent thief, because time was lost; the game has already moved on. And this was my huge mistake, which was reflected in the consequences: three or four players near us noticed our punctuation and, seeing that I so easily retreated, they probably took me for such a person. It was exactly twelve o'clock; I went into the next room, thought about it, figured out a new plan, and, returning, exchanged my credit cards with the bank for half-imperials. I found myself with over forty of them. I divided them into ten parts and decided to place ten bets in a row at zero,[59] each in four half-imperials, one after the other. “I win - my happiness, I put it down - so much the better; I will never play again."" I note that in all these two hours zero never came out, so in the end no one already set zero.","Having come to the club alone and finding myself surrounded by strangers, I installed myself at a corner of the table and began staking small sums. I sat like that for two hours without budging. For those two hours everything worked completely haphazardly—no patterns, nothing one way or the other. I let slip some wonderful opportunities but tried to control myself and remain calm and self-confident. After two hours I was just about where I'd started: of my three hundred rubles, I'd lost perhaps only ten or fifteen. That negligible result irritated me. Besides, a rather nauseating incident had taken place. I'm quite aware that one is likely to come across plain thieves at the gaming tables, not just common pickpockets from the street but quite well-known gamblers. I'm sure, for instance, that Aferdov, who is well known in all the gambling clubs, is a thief. Even now you can see him all over town driving a pair of his own ponies, but he's a thief because he has stolen from me. But I'll describe that incident later, for what happened during the evening in question was simply a prelude. As I was sitting in my corner, the neighbor on my left during all that time was a horrible dapper little fellow, I suspect a Jew. Actually he was a member of some political movement, did some writing, and was even published. At the very last moment, I won twenty rubles. Two red ten-ruble bills were put in front of me. All of a sudden I saw that wretched Jew stick out his hand and grab one of the bills. I was about to stop him, but before I could make a move he turned toward me himself and, in a calm voice and looking me arrogantly in the eye, informed me that it was his win because he had put down his stake at the very last second. Indeed, he did not wish to pursue the matter any further and turned away from me. Unfortunately, just at that moment, my mind was completely preoccupied with a stupid idea, and I just shrugged in disgust, got up, and left the table, letting him keep the ten rubles. Besides, it would have been difficult to force him to return my bill now, as the gambling had already resumed. I should have put my foot down right away and I hadn't done it. And that turned out to be a grievous mistake with deplorable repercussions. Two or three men at the table had noticed the incident and, realizing how readily I'd given in, took me for an easy mark. It was exactly midnight. I went to the adjacent room, thought out a new plan of action, came back, changed my big bills into forty-odd half-imperials, divided them into ten piles, and decided to place them ten times in a row on the zero. ""If I win—good; if I lose—even better, for then I'll never gamble again,"" I said to myself. And I want you to note that, during the two hours I had been playing before, the zero had never come up so that no one was even staking on it any more.","Finding myself alone in a crowd of strangers, I established myself at first at a corner of the table and began staking small sums. I remained sitting there without stirring for two hours. For those two hours the play was horribly flat—neither one thing nor another. I let slip some wonderful chances and tried not to lose my temper, but to preserve my coolness and confidence. At the end of the two hours I had neither lost nor won. Out of my three hundred roubles I had lost ten or fifteen roubles. This trivial result exasperated me, and what's more an exceedingly unpleasant, disgusting incident occurred. I know that such gambling saloons are frequented by thieves, who are not simply pickpockets out of the street but well-known gamblers. I am certain that the well- known gambler Aferdov is a thief; he is still to be seen about the town; I met him not long ago driving a pair of his own ponies, but he is a thief and he stole from me. But this incident I will describe later; what happened this evening was simply a prelude. I spent there two hours sitting at a corner of the table, and beside me, on the left, there was all the time an abominable little dandy, a Jew I believe; he is on some paper though, and even writes something and gets it published. At the very last moment I suddenly won twenty roubles. Two red notes lay before me, and suddenly I saw this wretched little Jew put out his hand and remove one of my notes. I tried to stop him; but with a most impudent air he immediately informed me, without raising his voice in the least, that it was what he had won, that he had just put down a stake and won it; he declined to continue the conversation and turned away. As ill-luck would have it, I was in a state of extreme stupidity at that moment: I was brooding over a great idea, and with a curse I got up quickly and walked away; I did not want to dispute, so made him a present of the red note. And indeed it would have been difficult to go into the matter with an impudent thief, for I had let slip the right moment, and the game was going on again. And that was my great mistake , the effect of which was apparent later on: three or four players near us saw how the matter ended, and noticing how easily I had given way, took me for another of the same sort. It was just twelve o'clock; I walked into the other room, and after a little reflection formed a new plan. Going back I changed my notes at the bank for half imperials. I received over forty of them. I divided them into ten lots, and resolved to stake four half imperials ten times running on the zero. ""If I win it's my luck. If I lose, so much the better, I'll never play again. "" I may mention that zero had not turned up once during those two hours, so that at last no one was staking on zero."

"Теперь предупрежу, что события с этого дня до самой катастрофы моей болезни пустились с такою быстротой, что мне, припоминая теперь, даже самому удивительно, как мог я устоять перед ними, как не задавила меня судьба.

Но постараюсь описать в строгом порядке, хотя предупреждаю, что тогда в мыслях моих мало было порядка. События налегли, как ветер, и мысли мои закрутились в уме, как осенние сухие листья. Так как я весь состоял из чужих мыслей, то где мне было взять своих, когда они потребовались для самостоятельного решения?

But I will try to describe in strict order, although I warn you that at that time there was little order in my thoughts.

"Бежал же я, то есть хотел было бежать, уже месяцев пять спустя после этих первых двух месяцев. И вообще я всю жизнь бывал туг на решение. Когда я ложился в постель и закрывался одеялом, я тотчас начинал мечтать об вас, Андрей Петрович, только об вас одном; совершенно не знаю, почему это так делалось. Вы мне и во сне даже снились. Главное, я все страстно мечтал, что вы вдруг войдете, я к вам брошусь и вы меня выведете из этого места и увезете к себе, в тот кабинет, и опять мы поедем в театр, ну и прочее. Главное, что мы не расстанемся – вот в чем было главное! Когда же утром приходилось просыпаться, то вдруг начинались насмешки и презрение мальчишек; один из них прямо начал бить меня и заставлял подавать сапоги; он бранил меня самыми скверными именами, особенно стараясь объяснить мне мое происхождение, к утехе всех слушателей. Когда же являлся наконец сам Тушар, в душе моей начиналось что-то невыносимое. Я чувствовал, что мне здесь никогда не простят, – о, я уже начинал помаленьку понимать, что именно не простят и чем именно я провинился! И вот я наконец положил бежать. Я мечтал об этом ужасно целых два месяца, наконец решился; тогда был сентябрь. Я выждал, когда все товарищи разъехались в субботу на воскресенье, а между тем потихоньку тщательно связал себе узелок самых необходимых вещиц; денег у меня было два рубля. Я хотел выждать, когда смеркнется. «Там спущусь по лестнице, – думал я, – и выйду, а потом и пойду». Куда? Я знал, что Андроников уже переведен в Петербург, и решил, что я отыщу дом Фанариотовой на Арбате; «ночь где-нибудь прохожу или просижу, а утром расспрошу кого-нибудь на дворе дома: где теперь Андрей Петрович и если не в Москве, то в каком городе или государстве? Наверно, скажут. Я уйду, а потом в другом месте где-нибудь и у кого-нибудь спрошу: в какую заставу идти, если в такой-то город, ну и выйду, и пойду, и пойду. Все буду идти; ночевать буду где-нибудь под кустами, а есть буду один только хлеб, а хлеба на два рубля мне очень надолго хватит». В субботу, однако, никак не удалось бежать; пришлось ожидать до завтра, до воскресенья, и, как нарочно, Тушар с женой куда-то в воскресенье уехали; остались во всем доме только я да Агафья. Я ждал ночи с страшной тоской, помню, сидел в нашей зале у окна и смотрел на пыльную улицу с деревянными домиками и на редких прохожих. Тушар жил в захолустье, и из окон видна была застава: уж не та ли? – мерещилось мне. Солнце закатывалось такое красное, небо было такое холодное, и острый ветер, точь-в-точь как сегодня, подымал песок. Стемнело наконец совсем; я стал перед образом и начал молиться, только скоро-скоро, я торопился; захватил узелок и на цыпочках пошел с скрипучей нашей лестницы, ужасно боясь, чтобы не услыхала меня из кухни Агафья. Дверь была на ключе, я отворил, и вдруг – темная-темная ночь зачернела передо мной, как бесконечная опасная неизвестность, а ветер так и рванул с меня фуражку. Я было вышел; на той стороне тротуара раздался сиплый, пьяный рев ругавшегося прохожего; я постоял, поглядел и тихо вернулся, тихо прошел наверх, тихо разделся, сложил узелок и лег ничком, без слез и без мыслей, и вот с этой-то самой минуты я и стал мыслить, Андрей Петрович! Вот с самой этой минуты, когда я сознал, что я, сверх того, что лакей, вдобавок, и трус, и началось настоящее, правильное мое развитие!","I ran, that is, I wanted to run, five months after these first two months. And in general, all my life I have been tight on the decision. When I lay down in bed and covered myself with a blanket, I immediately began to dream of you, Andrey Petrovich, only of you; I don't really know why it was done this way. I even dreamed about you in my dreams. The main thing is that I kept dreaming passionately that you would suddenly come in, I would rush to you and you would lead me out of this place and take me to your place, to that office, and again we would go to the theater, and so on. The main thing is that we will not part - that was the main thing! When in the morning I had to wake up, then suddenly the boys began to ridicule and contempt; one of them directly began to beat me and forced me to bring boots; he scolded me with the nastiest names, especially trying to explain to me my origin, to the delight of all listeners. When Touchard himself finally appeared, something unbearable began in my soul. I felt that they would never forgive me here - oh, I was already beginning to understand little by little what exactly they would not forgive me and what exactly I had done wrong! And so I finally set to run. I dreamed about it terribly for two whole months, finally made up my mind; then it was September. I waited until all the comrades had departed on Saturday for Sunday, and in the meantime I slowly carefully tied a bundle of the most necessary little things for myself; I had two roubles. I wanted to wait until it got dark. “I’ll go down the stairs there,” I thought, “and get out, and then I’ll go.” Where? I knew that Andronikov had already been transferred to Petersburg, and I decided that I would find Fanariotova's house on the Arbat; “I pass the night somewhere or sit, and in the morning I will ask someone in the courtyard of the house: where is Andrei Petrovich now, and if not in Moscow, then in what city or state? They will probably say. I'll leave, and then in another place somewhere and someone I'll ask: which outpost to go to, if in such and such a city, well, I'll go out, and I'll go, and I'll go. I'll all go; I will spend the night somewhere under the bushes, and I will eat only bread, and two rubles worth of bread will be enough for me for a very long time. On Saturday, however, there was no way to escape; I had to wait until tomorrow, until Sunday, and, as if on purpose, Touchard and his wife left somewhere on Sunday; there were only me and Agafya left in the whole house. I waited for the night with terrible anguish, I remember sitting in our hall by the window and looking at the dusty street with wooden houses and at rare passers-by. Tushar lived in a backwater, and from the windows one could see the outpost: isn’t that the one? - it seemed to me. The sun was setting so red, the sky was so cold, and a sharp wind, just like today, kicked up the sand. It got dark at last; I stood in front of the image and began to pray, only soon, soon, I was in a hurry; grabbed the bundle and tiptoed down our creaky stairs, terribly afraid that Agafya would not hear me from the kitchen. The door was on the key, I opened it, and suddenly - a dark, dark night blackened before me, like an endless dangerous unknown, and the wind tore my cap off me. I was about to leave; on the other side of the sidewalk there was a hoarse, drunken roar of a cursing passerby; I stood there, looked, and quietly returned, quietly went upstairs, quietly undressed, folded my bundle and lay down on my face, without tears and without thoughts, and from that very moment I began to think, Andrey Petrovich! From that very moment, when I realized that, besides being a lackey, I was also a coward, my real, correct development began!","""As for running away, I decided on that only about five months after those first dreadful couple of months. In general, all my life I've been very slow to take action. Every night when I went to bed and pulled the blanket over my head, I'd always go back to making up those romances about you, sir, about you alone, I don't know why. And when I fell asleep, it was you I'd dream of. The scene I liked best to imagine was you arriving at the school, me throwing myself into your arms, and you taking me away, to that Moscow study where we'd met and then to the theater, and things like that. And we would never be parted again—that was the most important! ""But in the mornings I had to wake up and get out of bed. Then the baiting by the boys would start all over again. One of them would beat me up first thing every morning and force me to bring him his boots while calling me disgusting names and explaining the secrets of my birth to the great enjoyment of the others. By the time Touchard came around, I was utterly miserable. I felt that I'd never be forgiven by these people and I began to understand what I'd done wrong. Yes, I finally did gather how I was wrong and why I couldn't be forgivenl And that's when I decided to run away. I dreamed incessantly of running away for two months. Then September came around and I decided it was time to go carry out my plan. I waited for all the boys to leave school on Saturday night to spend Sunday with their families. I had carefully made a bundle of the most indispensable things to take with mo. I had two rubles in cush. I thought I'd wait until it got dark enough. I'd go downstairs, go out the gates, and start walking. Where would I go? I knew that the Andronikovs had moved to Petersburg. So I'd find Mrs. Fanariotov's house on Arbat Drive. I'd spend the night walking around or hide myself in a doorway, and in the morning I'd try to find out from someone in the courtyard of the Fa-nariotov house where Mr. Versilov lived, if not in Moscow, then what town or what country. I was sure they'd tell me. And then I'd go back into the street and ask someone else by which gate I should leave Moscow to get to such and such a town or country and I'd start walking. I'd sleep at night under the bushes and I'd eat nothing but bread because one can buy lots of bread with two rubles. ""But I couldn't manage to slip out of the school Saturday night and had to wait until Sunday. It so happened that Touchard and his wife went out somewhere for the day and I was all alone with Agafia. I waited for night to come in a state of terrible anguish. I remember sitting by the schoolroom window, looking out at the dusty street and the few passers-by. Touchard's school was on the edge of Petersburg and from the window I could see a city gate. Would that be the one for me, I wondered. The sun was so red as it rolled down the horizon and the sky looked awfully cold and the wickedly biting wind was raising clouds of dust just like today. At last it got quite dark. I knelt before the icon and prayed. But I prayed very quickly since I was in a great hurry. Then I picked up my little bundle and tiptoed down the creaking stairs, terrified at the thought that Agafia should hear me from the kitchen. The door was locked. I turned the key and suddenly there was the blackness of the night stretching in front of me, boundless, dangerous, and unknown. A burst of wind almost tore my cap off my head. I stepped out into the street. From across the street I heard a scream, a drunken voice, and a streak of foul oaths. I stood there for a few moments, looking out into the darkness. Then I turned around, went back into the house, walked quietly upstairs, unpacked my bundle, undressed, and lay down flat on my face. I didn't cry, my mind was blank, but it was this incident that started me thinking: it made me realize that, besides being a flunkey, I was also a coward, and it was with this realization that my real mental growth began!""","""I was running away; that's to say, I was on the point of running away for five months after those first two months. I have always been slow in taking action. When I got into bed and pulled the quilt over me, I began thinking of you at once, Andrey Petrovitch, only of you, of no one else; I don't in the least know why it was so. I dreamed about you too. I used always to be passionately imagining that you would walk in, and I would rush up to you and you would take me out of that place, and bring me home with you to the same study, and that we would go to the theatre again, and so on. Above all, that we should not part again—that was the chief thing! As soon as I had to wake up in the morning the jeers and contempt of the boys began again; one of them actually began beating me and making me put on his boots for him; he called me the vilest names, particularly aiming at making my origin clear to me, to the diversion of all who heard him. When at last Touchard himself became comprehensible, something unbearable began in my soul. I felt that I should never be forgiven here. Oh, I was beginning by degrees to understand what it was they would not forgive me and of what I was guilty! And so at last I resolved to run away. For two whole months I dreamed of it incessantly at last—it was September— I made up my mind. I waited for Saturday, when my schoolfellows used to go home for the week-end, and meanwhile I secretly and carefully got together a bundle of the most necessary things; all the money I had was two roubles. I meant to wait till dusk; 'then I will go downstairs,' I thought, 'and I'll go out and walk away!' Where? I knew that Andronikov had moved to Petersburg, and I resolved that I would look for Mme. Fanariotov's house in Arbaty; 'I'll spend the night walking or sitting somewhere, and in the morning I'll ask some one in the courtyard of the house, where Andrey Petrovitch is now, and if not in Moscow, in what town or country. They will be sure to tell me. I'll walk away, and then ask some one, somewhere else, by which gate to go out to reach such a town; and then I'll go and walk and walk, I shall keep on walking; I shall sleep somewhere under the bushes; I shall eat nothing but bread, and for two roubles I can get bread enough for a long time.' ""I could not manage to run away on Saturday, however; I had to wait till next day, Sunday, and as luck would have it, Touchard and his wife were going away somewhere for the Sunday ; there was no one left in the house but Agafya and me. I awaited the night in terrible agitation, I remember. I sat at the window in the schoolroom, looking out at the dusty street, the little wooden houses, and the few passers-by. Touchard lived in an out-of-the- way street; from the windows I could see one of the city gates; 'Isn't it the one?' I kept wondering. The sun set in a red glow, the sky was so cold-looking, and a piercing wind was stirring up the dust, just as it is to-day. It was quite dark at last; I stood before the ikon and began to pray, only very, very quickly, I was in haste; I caught up my bundle, and went on tip-toe down the creaking stairs, horribly afraid that Agafya would hear me from the kitchen. The door was locked, I turned the key, and at once a dark, dark night loomed black before me like a boundless perilous unknown land, and the wind snatched off my cap. I was just going out on the same side of the pavement; I heard a hoarse volley of oaths from a drunken man in the street. I stood, looked, and slowly turned, slowly went upstairs, slowly took off my things, put down my little bundle and lay down flat, without tears, and without thoughts, and it was from that moment, Andrey Petrovitch, that I began to think. It was from that moment that I realized that besides being a lackey, I was a coward, too, and my real development began!"""

"Почти тотчас же я заслышал шаги, важные, неспешные, мягкие, и высокая фигура красивого и надменного молодого человека (тогда он мне показался еще бледнее и худощавее, чем в сегодняшнюю встречу) показалась на пороге в переднюю – даже на аршин не доходя до порога. Он был в великолепном красном шелковом халате и в туфлях, и с пенсне на носу. Не проговорив ни слова, он направил на меня пенсне и стал рассматривать. Я, как зверь, шагнул к нему один шаг и стал с вызовом, смотря на него в упор. Но рассматривал он меня лишь мгновение, всего секунд десять; вдруг самая неприметная усмешка показалась на губах его, и, однако ж, самая язвительная, тем именно и язвительная, что почти неприметная; он молча повернулся и пошел опять в комнаты, так же не торопясь, так же тихо и плавно, как и пришел. О, эти обидчики еще с детства, еще в семействах своих выучиваются матерями своими обижать! Разумеется, я потерялся… О, зачем я тогда потерялся!","Almost immediately I heard footsteps, important, unhurried, soft, and the tall figure of a handsome and arrogant young man (then he seemed to me even paler and thinner than today's meeting) appeared on the threshold into the hall - not even a arshin not reaching the threshold. He was in a magnificent red silk dressing gown and shoes, and pince-nez on his nose. Without saying a word, he pointed his pince-nez at me and began to examine. I, like a beast, took one step towards him and stood with a challenge, looking at him point-blank. But he looked at me for only a moment, only ten seconds; suddenly the most inconspicuous smile appeared on his lips, and, however, the most caustic, precisely because it was almost inconspicuous; he silently turned and went back into the rooms, just as unhurried, as quietly and smoothly as he had come. Oh, these offenders from childhood, even in their families, are taught by their mothers to offend! Of course, I got lost ... Oh, why did I get lost then!","Almost at once I heard dignified, unhurried, light steps: a tall, handsome, and arrogant young man appeared in the doorway and stopped a yard or so short of it (that time he struck me even as paler and leaner than when I met him the second time). He was wearing a gorgeous red silk dressing gown, slippers, and a pince-nez. Without saying a word, he stared at me through his pince-nez and started examining me. Like a wild beast, I took one step in his direction, stopped, and glared challengingly into his face. But he studied me like that for only a few seconds and then a very slight mocking grin twisted his lips, whereupon he slowly turned away and walked back into the inner rooms just as lightly and smoothly as he'd come. Oh, these people learn from childhood, from their mothers' knee, how to offend others! Of course, I felt completely lost. . . . Oh, why did I have to lose my head just then!","Almost at the same time I heard footsteps, dignified, quiet, unhurried, and a tall figure of a handsome and haughty-looking young man (he seemed to me then even thinner and paler than when I met him to-day) appeared in the doorway a yard from the door leading into the passage. He was wearing a magnificent red silk dressing-gown and slippers, and had a pince-nez on his nose. Without uttering a word he fixed me with his pince-nez and proceeded to stare at me. I took one step towards him like a wild beast, and began glaring at him defiantly. But he only scrutinized me for a moment, ten seconds at the utmost; suddenly I detected on his lips a scarcely perceptible, but most malignant smile— what made it so malignant was that it was scarcely perceptible: he turned round without a word and went back into the room, just as deliberately, just as quietly and smoothly as he had come. Oh, these insolent fellows are trained by their mothers from childhood to be insolent! I lost my head of course… . Oh, why did I lose my head!"

"Дергачев жил в маленьком флигеле, на дворе деревянного дома одной купчихи, но зато флигель занимал весь. Всего было чистых три комнаты. Во всех четырех окнах были спущены шторы. Это был техник и имел в Петербурге занятие; я слышал мельком, что ему выходило одно выгодное частное место в губернии и что он уже отправляется.","Dergachev lived in a small outbuilding, in the yard of a merchant's woman's wooden house, but the outbuilding occupied the entirety. There were three clean rooms in total. Curtains were drawn in all four windows. He was a technician and had an occupation in Petersburg; I heard in passing that he was getting a profitable private post in the province, and that he was already on his way.",Dergachev occupied the whole cottage in the yard of a wooden house belonging to a merchant's wife; the cottage had three rooms and in all of them the blinds were drawn. He was an engineer and was now employed in Petersburg. But I understand that he had been offered a very lucrative job with a private firm in the provinces and that he had decided to accept it and would leave soon.,"Dergatchev lived in a little lodge in the courtyard of a wooden house belonging to a merchant's wife, but he occupied the whole of it. There were only three living rooms. All the four windows had the blinds drawn down. He was a mechanical engineer, and did work in Petersburg. I had heard casually that he had got a good private berth in the provinces, and that he was just going away to it."
"Но, требуя честности от других, буду честен и сам: я должен сознаться, что зашитый в кармане документ возбуждал во мне не одно только страстное желание лететь на помощь Версилову. Теперь для меня это уж слишком ясно, хоть я и тогда уже краснел от мысли. Мне мерещилась женщина, гордое существо высшего света, с которою я встречусь лицом к лицу; она будет презирать меня, смеяться надо мной, как над мышью, даже и не подозревая, что я властелин судьбы ее. Эта мысль пьянила меня еще в Москве, и особенно в вагоне, когда я сюда ехал; я признался уже в этом выше. Да, я ненавидел эту женщину, но уже любил ее как мою жертву, и все это правда, все было действительно. Но уж это было такое детство, которого я даже и от такого, как я, не ожидал. Я описываю тогдашние мои чувства, то есть то, что мне шло в голову тогда, когда я сидел в трактире под соловьем и когда порешил в тот же вечер разорвать с ними неминуемо. Мысль о давешней встрече с этой женщиной залила вдруг тогда краской стыда мое лицо. Позорная встреча! Позорное и глупенькое впечатленьице – главное – сильнее всего доказавшее мою неспособность к делу! Оно доказывало лишь то, думал я тогда, что я не в силах устоять даже и пред глупейшими приманками, тогда как сам же сказал сейчас Крафту, что у меня есть «свое место», есть свое дело и что если б у меня было три жизни, то и тогда бы мне было их мало. Я гордо сказал это. То, что я бросил мою идею и затянулся в дела Версилова, – это еще можно было бы чем-нибудь извинить; но то, что я бросаюсь, как удивленный заяц, из стороны в сторону и затягиваюсь уже в каждые пустяки, в том, конечно, одна моя глупость. На какой ляд дернуло меня идти к Дергачеву и выскочить с моими глупостями, давно зная за собой, что ничего не сумею рассказать умно и толково и что мне всего выгоднее молчать? И какой-нибудь Васин вразумляет меня тем, что у меня еще «пятьдесят лет жизни впереди и, стало быть, тужить не о чем». Возражение его прекрасно, я согласен, и делает честь его бесспорному уму; прекрасно уже тем, что самое простое, а самое простое понимается всегда лишь под конец, когда уж перепробовано все, что мудреней или глупей; но я знал это возражение и сам, раньше Васина; эту мысль я прочувствовал с лишком три года назад; даже мало того, в ней-то и заключается отчасти «моя идея». Вот что я думал тогда в трактире.","But, in demanding honesty from others, I will be honest myself: I must confess that the document sewn in my pocket aroused in me not only a passionate desire to fly to the aid of Versilov. It is all too clear to me now, though I was already blushing at the thought. I imagined a woman, a proud being of the highest light, with whom I would meet face to face; she will despise me, laugh at me like a mouse, not even suspecting that I am the master of her fate. This thought intoxicated me even in Moscow, and especially in the carriage when I was on my way here; I have already admitted this above. Yes, I hated this woman, but I already loved her as my victim, and all this was true, all was real. But it was such a childhood that I did not even expect from someone like me. I am describing my feelings at the time, that is, what went through my mind when I was sitting in a tavern under a nightingale and when I decided that same evening to break with them inevitably. The thought of a recent meeting with this woman suddenly flooded my face with a blush of shame. Shameful meeting! A shameful and stupid impression - the main thing - which most of all proved my inability to do business! It only proved, I thought then, that I was unable to resist even the stupidest bait, while I myself told Kraft now that I had “my place”, I had my own business, and that if I had three lives , then even then I would not have enough of them. I proudly said it. The fact that I abandoned my idea and dragged myself into the affairs of Versilov could still be excused in some way; but the fact that I rush from side to side like a surprised hare and drag myself into every trifle is, of course, my only stupidity. What the hell made me want to go to Dergachev and rush out with my stupidities, knowing for a long time that I would not be able to tell anything intelligently and sensibly, and that it was most advantageous for me to remain silent? And some Vasin admonishes me by saying that I still have ""fifty years of my life ahead of me and, therefore, there is nothing to grieve about."" His objection is excellent, I agree, and does credit to his indisputable mind; it is wonderful already because the simplest, and the simplest is always understood only at the end, when everything that is more clever or stupid has already been tried; but I knew this objection myself, before Vassin; I felt this thought more than three years ago; even more than that, it is partly “my idea” that lies in it. That's what I thought then in the tavern.","But if I demand honesty of others, I must be honest myself and admit that the document sewn into my lining aroused in me other desires than rushing to Versilov's assistance. It's quite obvious to me now, but at that time the mere suspicion of it made me blush. I had visions of coming face to face with a haughty, high-society lady; she would despise me, mock me, treat me as though I were a miserable mouse, never suspecting for a second that her future was in my hands. That thought had fascinated me while I was still in Moscow and had grown even stronger in the train carrying me to Petersburg, as I have confessed earlier. Yes, I hated that woman, but I already loved her too as my destined victim, and all this was true, completely true. But it was also so awfully childish that I wouldn't have expected it even from someone as immature as myself. What I'm describing here is the way I felt in that tavern , I mean the thoughts that went through my head as I sat there under the caged nightingale and decided to break with these people once and for all. The thought of my morning meeting with that woman made me blush with shame. How ignominious! What a disgraceful lack of control! And the worst thing about it was that it showed my complete inadequacy for the task I had assigned myself. It proved to me that I was unable to resist even the most ordinary pitfalls and made all the words sound hollow that I had just been saying to Kraft about having within me a place that I could call my own and if I had three lives to live, I'd still find them not enough. And I said all that so proudly! I can still find excuses for myself for putting aside my personal pursuits to help Versilov, but rushing around like a crazed rabbit, sniffing here and there and all over the place, and getting involved in all sorts of extraneous things—that was nothing but sheer stupidity. What on earth, for instance, could have induced me to go to Dergachev's and start spouting all those inanities when I should have known in advance that I couldn't possibly explain anything to them so that it would make sense and that the best thing I could do was to keep my mouth shut? And after that there was Vasin trying to make me feel better by reminding me that I still had perhaps fifty years ahead of me and that therefore nothing was irretrievably lost. That argument does honor to this man's indisputable intelligence and is so strong because it brings up the simplest possible reason, and the simplest reasons are best grasped only in the end when everything else, wise and absurd, has been tried. But I had thought of that argument myself three years before I heard it from Vasin, and indeed my ""idea"" was in part based on it. . . . Those were the thoughts going through my head as I sat in that tavern.","But, expecting honesty from others, I will be honest myself. I must confess that the letter sewn up in my pocket did not only arouse in me the passionate desire to rush to Versilov's aid. Now it is quite clear to me, and even then I thought of it with a blush. I had visions of a woman—a proud, aristocratic creature— whom I should meet face to face. She would laugh at me, despise me, as though I were a mouse; she would not even suspect that her future was in my power. This idea intoxicated me even in Moscow, and still more in the train on the way; I have confessed this already. Yes, I hated that woman, but already I loved her as my victim; and all this was true, all this was real. But this was childishness which I should not have expected even from anyone like me. I am describing my feelings then, that is, what passed through my mind as I sat in the restaurant under the nightingale and made up my mind to break with them for ever. The memory of my recent meeting with that woman sent a rush of colour to my face. An ignominious meeting! An ignominious and stupid impression, and— what mattered most—it showed my incapacity for action. It proved— I thought then—that I was not strong enough to withstand the stupidest lure, though I told Kraft myself just now that I had my place ""within myself,"" and work of my own, and that if I had three lives they wouldn't be enough for me. I said that proudly. My having abandoned my idea and mixed myself up with Versilov's affairs was to some extent excusable, but that I should run from side to side like a frightened hare and be drawn into every trifle— that, of course, was simply my own folly. What induced me to go to Dergatchev's and to burst out with my imbecilities, though I knew long ago that I am incapable of saying anything cleverly or sensibly, that it is always better for me to be silent? And some Vassin or other reassures me with the reflection that I've fifty years of life ahead of me and so I've no need to worry. It was a good reply, I admit, and did credit to his unmistakable intelligence; it was good because it was the simplest, and what is simplest is never understood till the last, when everything that is cleverer or stupider has been tried already. But I knew that answer before Vassin; I'd had an inkling of that thought more than three years ago; what's more, my ""idea"" was to some extent included in it. Such were my reflections in the restaurant."

Oh, how ugly it was!","But I was ashamed of myself! I was my own judge, and—my God, what was there in my heart! But there's no need to describe that hellish, insufferable feeling, and that consciousness of filth and vileness. But yet I must confess it, for I feel the time has come. It must be recorded in my story. So let it be known that I meant to shame her, and planned to be almost a witness of her yielding to Lambert's demands— oh, the baseness!—not for the sake of saving Versilov in his madness and bringing him back to mother, but because … perhaps because I was myself in love and jealous! Jealous of whom: of Büring, of Versilov? Of anyone she might look at, or talk to at a ball, while I should be standing in a corner ashamed of myself… . Oh, the hideousness of it!"

Если б мне сказали заранее и спросили: «Что бы я сделал с ним в ту минуту?» – я бы наверно ответил, что растерзал бы его на части. Но вышло совсем иное, и совсем не по моей воле: я вдруг закрыл лицо обеими руками и горько, навзрыд, заплакал. Само так вышло! В молодом человеке сказался вдруг маленький ребенок.

"– Я думаю, что все это произойдет как-нибудь чрезвычайно ординарно, – проговорил он раз. – Просто-напросто все государства, несмотря на все балансы в бюджетах и на «отсутствие дефицитов», un beau matin[50] запутаются окончательно и все до единого пожелают не заплатить, чтоб всем до единого обновиться во всеобщем банкрутстве. Между тем весь консервативный элемент всего мира сему воспротивится, ибо он-то и будет акционером и кредитором, и банкрутства допустить не захочет. Тогда, разумеется, начнется, так сказать, всеобщее окисление; прибудет много жида, и начнется жидовское царство; а засим все те, которые никогда не имели акций, да и вообще ничего не имели, то есть все нищие, естественно не захотят участвовать в окислении… Начнется борьба, и, после семидесяти семи поражений, нищие уничтожат акционеров, отберут у них акции и сядут на их место, акционерами же разумеется. Может, и скажут что-нибудь новое, а может, и нет. Вернее, что тоже обанкрутятся. Далее, друг мой, ничего не умею предугадать в судьбах, которые изменят лик мира сего. Впрочем, посмотри в Апокалипсисе…","“I think that all this will happen in some extremely ordinary way,” he said once. – Quite simply, all states, despite all the balances in the budgets and the “lack of deficits”, un beau matin [50] will become completely confused and everyone will want not to pay, so that everyone can be renewed in the universal bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the entire conservative element of the whole world will oppose this, because it will be the shareholder and creditor, and will not want to allow bankruptcy. Then, of course, a general oxidation, so to speak, will begin; many Jews will arrive, and the Jewish kingdom will begin; and then all those who never had shares, and indeed had nothing at all, that is, all the beggars, naturally will not want to participate in the oxidation ... A struggle will begin, and, after seventy-seven defeats, the beggars will destroy the shareholders, take away their shares and sit down in their place, shareholders of course. Maybe they will say something new, but maybe not. Rather, they will also go bankrupt.

Of course, the conservative elements all over the world will be opposed to that declaration because they'll be the shareholders and the creditors of the governments. Then there'll be what we may call a general fermentation: Jews will appear all over the place and Jewish rule will begin. And those who never held any shares, indeed, never possessed anything, that is, all the penniless beggars, will refuse to accept a liquidation based on former holdings, and the struggle will begin. . . . Well, then, after seventy-seven defeats, the beggars will wipe out the shareholders, take their shares away from them, and, of course, become shareholders themselves. Perhaps they'll introduce some innovations, and perhaps they won't. Most likely they'll go bankrupt too.

At the same time all the conservative elements of the whole world will rise up in opposition to everything, because they will be the bondholders and creditors, and they won't want to allow the bankruptcy.

– Да! – воскликнул я и расстегнул сюртук.,- Yes! I exclaimed and unbuttoned my coat.,"""Here,"" I said, unbuttoning my jacket.","""Yes,"" I exclaimed and unbuttoned my coat."
"– А я очень рада, что вы именно теперь так говорите, – с значением ответила она мне. Я должен сказать, что она никогда не заговаривала со мной о моей беспорядочной жизни и об омуте, в который я окунулся, хотя, я знал это, она обо всем этом не только знала, но даже стороной расспрашивала. Так что теперь это было вроде первого намека, и – сердце мое еще более повернулось к ней.","“And I’m very glad that you’re talking like that right now,” she answered me meaningfully. I must say that she never spoke to me about my hectic life and about the pool in which I plunged, although I knew this, she not only knew about all this, but even asked sideways. So now it was like the first hint, and - my heart turned even more towards her.","""And I'm delighted to hear you say that,"" she said rather gravely. I must note here that she never spoke to me about my disorderly way of life, about the cesspool in which I was now swimming, although I was aware that not only had she heard about it but she was even interested enough to question people about it. But now I felt she was moving closer to talking to me on the subject, and my heart opened even wider to her.","""I am awfully glad that you say that just now,"" she answered with peculiar significance. I must mention that she never spoke to me of the reckless way I was living, and the depths to which I was sinking, although (I knew it) she was not only aware of all this, but even made inquiries about it indirectly. So that this now was something like the first hint on the subject, and my heart turned to her more warmly than ever."
Краска быстро залила ее лицо.,Color quickly flooded her face.,The color rushed to her face.,The colour rushed into her face.
"Так и пустили луч. И видел я сам потом, уже спустя, картину сию, и этот луч самый, и реку – во всю стену вытянул, вся синяя; и отрок милый тут же, обе ручки к грудкам прижал, и маленькую барышню, и ежика – все потрафил. Только Максим Иванович тогда никому картину не открыл, а запер ее в кабинете на ключ от всех глаз. А уж как рвались по городу, чтоб повидать: всех гнать велел. Большой разговор пошел. А Петр Степанович словно из себя тогда вышел: «Я, говорит, теперь уже все могу; мне, говорит, только в Санкт-Петербурге при дворе состоять». Любезнейший был человек, а превозноситься любил беспримерно. И постигла его участь: как получил все двести рублей, начал тотчас же пить и всем деньги показывать, похваляясь; и убил его пьяного ночью наш мещанин, с которым и пил, и деньги ограбил; все сие наутро и объяснилось.","So the beam was fired. And I myself saw later, already later, this picture, and this ray itself, and the river - stretched out into the entire wall, all blue; and the dear boy right there, pressed both hands to his breasts, and the little young lady, and the hedgehog - he pleased everything. Only Maxim Ivanovich did not open the picture to anyone at that time, but locked it in his office with a key from all eyes. And how they rushed around the city to see: he ordered everyone to be driven. There was a big conversation. And Pyotr Stepanovich seemed to have lost his temper then: “I, he says, now I can do everything; me, he says, to consist only in St. Petersburg at the court. He was the most amiable man, and he loved to exalt himself unparalleled. And his fate befell him: as soon as he received all two hundred rubles, he immediately began to drink and show money to everyone, boasting; and our tradesman killed him drunk at night, with whom he drank and robbed money; all this was explained in the morning.","Perhaps that ray will do."" And so they agreed to lower that ray. And later I saw the picture with my own eyes—the ray and the river and all. It stretched across the whole wall, that painting, with plenty of blue in it and with that sweet little boy pressing his little fists to his chest, and the little girl, and the hedgehog—the teacher had managed to put everything in. But at the time, Maxim wouldn't show the picture to anyone. He kept his study locked so no one could see it. Many of the townsfolk tried hard to get a glimpse of the painting, but Maxim ordered the servants not to let anyone in. As to Peter Stepanovich, the former teacher, it was as if it all went to his head: ""I,"" he went around saying, ""can do anything; my place is really in Petersburg, in fact at the Tsar's court."" He was the nicest man there was, although he diet have that weakness for boasting. Besides, he was fated to meet his end very soon: the very day he got his two hundred rubles he got himself drunk and went around bragging and flashing his money so everybody could see it. Well, a fellow from our own town killed him that night and took the money, we found out the next morning.","So he painted the ray. I saw that picture myself afterwards, and that very ray of light, and the river. It stretched right across the wall, all blue, and the sweet boy was there, both little hands pressed to his breast, and the little lady, and the hedgehog, he put it all in. Only Maxim Ivanovitch showed no one the picture at the time, but locked it up in his room, away from all eyes; and when the people trooped from all over the town to see it, he bade them drive every one away. There was a great talk about it. Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed as though he were beside himself. ""I can do anything now,"" said he. ""I've only to set up in St. Petersburg at the court."" He was a very polite man, but he liked boasting beyond all measure. And his fate overtook him; when he received the full two hundred roubles, he began drinking at once, and showed his money to every one, bragging of it, and he was murdered at night, when he was drunk, and his money stolen by a workman with whom he was drinking, and it all became known in the morning."

"Рана его оказалась несмертельною и зажила, но пролежал он довольно долго – у мамы, разумеется. Теперь, когда я пишу эти строки, – на дворе весна, половина мая, день прелестный, и у нас отворены окна. Мама сидит около него; он гладит рукой ее щеки и волосы и с умилением засматривает ей в глаза. О, это – только половина прежнего Версилова; от мамы он уже не отходит и уж никогда не отойдет более. Он даже получил «дар слезный», как выразился незабвенный Макар Иванович в своей повести о купце; впрочем, мне кажется, что Версилов проживет долго. С нами он теперь совсем простодушен и искренен, как дитя, не теряя, впрочем, ни меры, ни сдержанности и не говоря лишнего. Весь ум его и весь нравственный склад его остались при нем, хотя все, что было в нем идеального, еще сильнее выступило вперед. Я прямо скажу, что никогда столько не любил его, как теперь, и мне жаль, что не имею ни времени, ни места, чтобы поболее поговорить о нем. Впрочем, расскажу один недавний анекдот (а их много): к Великому посту он уже выздоровел и на шестой неделе объявил, что будет говеть. Не говел он лет тридцать, я думаю, или более. Мама была рада; стали готовить постное кушанье, довольно, однако, дорогое и утонченное. Я слышал из другой комнаты, как он в понедельник и во вторник напевал про себя: «Се жених грядет» – и восторгался и напевом и стихом. В эти два дня он несколько раз прекрасно говорил о религии; но в среду говенье вдруг прекратилось. Что-то его вдруг раздражило, какой-то «забавный контраст», как он выразился смеясь. Что-то не понравилось ему в наружности священника, в обстановке; но только он воротился и вдруг сказал с тихою улыбкою: «Друзья мои, я очень люблю Бога, но – я к этому не способен». В тот же день за обедом уже подали ростбиф. Но я знаю, что мама часто и теперь садится подле него и тихим голосом, с тихой улыбкой, начинает с ним заговаривать иногда о самых отвлеченных вещах: теперь она вдруг как-то осмелилась перед ним, но как это случилось – не знаю. Она садится около него и говорит ему, всего чаще шепотом. Он слушает с улыбкою, гладит ее волосы, целует ее руки, и самое полное счастье светится на лице его. С ним бывают иногда и припадки, почти истерические. Он берет тогда ее фотографию, ту самую, которую он в тот вечер целовал, смотрит на нее со слезами, целует, вспоминает, подзывает нас всех к себе, но говорит в такие минуты мало… О Катерине Николаевне он как будто совершенно забыл и имени ее ни разу не упомянул. О браке с мамой тоже еще ничего у нас не сказано. Хотели было на лето везти его за границу; но Татьяна Павловна настояла, чтоб не возить, да и он сам не захотел. Летом они проживут на даче, где-то в деревне, в Петербургском уезде. Кстати, мы все пока живем на средства Татьяны Павловны. Одно прибавлю: мне страшно грустно, что, в течение этих записок, я часто позволял себе относиться об этом человеке непочтительно и свысока. Но я писал, слишком воображая себя таким именно, каким был в каждую из тех минут, которые описывал. Кончив же записки и дописав последнюю строчку, я вдруг почувствовал, что перевоспитал себя самого, именно процессом припоминания и записывания. От многого отрекаюсь, что написал, особенно от тона некоторых фраз и страниц, но не вычеркну и не поправлю ни единого слова.","His wound turned out to be non-fatal and healed, but he lay for a long time - with his mother, of course. Now, as I write these lines, it is spring, the middle of May, a lovely day, and our windows are open. Mom sits beside him; he strokes her cheeks and hair with his hand and gazes tenderly into her eyes. Oh, this is only half of the former Versilov; he no longer leaves his mother, and he will never leave again. He even received a “tearful gift,” as the unforgettable Makar Ivanovich put it in his story about a merchant; however, it seems to me that Versilov will live a long time. With us, he is now quite simple-hearted and sincere, like a child, without losing, however, neither measure nor restraint, and without saying too much. All his mind and all his moral make-up remained with him, although everything that was ideal in him came forward even more strongly. I will say frankly that I have never loved him as much as I do now, and I am sorry that I have neither time nor space to talk more about him. However, I will tell you one recent anecdote (and there are many): by the time of Great Lent, he had already recovered and in the sixth week he announced that he would fast. He did not speak for thirty years, I think, or more. Mom was glad; they began to prepare a lean meal, however, rather expensive and refined. I heard from another room how on Monday and Tuesday he sang to himself: “Behold the bridegroom is coming” - and admired both the melody and the verse. During these two days he spoke beautifully about religion several times; but on Wednesday the fasting suddenly stopped. Something suddenly annoyed him, some ""funny contrast,"" as he put it, laughing. He did not like something in the appearance of the priest, in the atmosphere; but as soon as he returned, he suddenly said with a quiet smile: “My friends, I love God very much, but I am not capable of this.” On the same day, roast beef was already served at dinner. But I know that my mother often even now sits down beside him and in a low voice, with a quiet smile, sometimes begins to talk to him about the most abstract things: now she suddenly somehow dared in front of him, but I don’t know how this happened. She sits down beside him and speaks to him, mostly in a whisper. He listens with a smile, strokes her hair, kisses her hands, and the most complete happiness shines on his face. He sometimes has seizures, almost hysterical. Then he takes her photograph, the same one that he kissed that evening, looks at her with tears, kisses, remembers, calls us all to him, but at such moments he says little ... He seems to have completely forgotten about Katerina Nikolaevna and her name never mentioned. We have not yet said anything about marriage with my mother. They wanted to take him abroad for the summer; but Tatyana Pavlovna insisted not to take him, and he himself did not want to. In the summer they will live in a dacha, somewhere in the village, in the Petersburg district. By the way, we all still live on the means of Tatiana Pavlovna. I will add one thing: I am terribly sad that, during these notes, I often allowed myself to treat this person disrespectfully and haughtily. But I wrote, imagining myself too much exactly as I was in each of those moments that I described. When I finished my notes and added the last line, I suddenly felt that I had re-educated myself, precisely by the process of remembering and writing down. I renounce much that I have written, especially the tone of certain phrases and pages, but I will not delete or correct a single word.","His wound, although not fatal, still turned out to be grave enough for him to have to stay in bed for a long time. He spent that time, of course, at Mother's. Now, as I write these lines, spring is outside the windows. It is mid-May. Mother is sitting by his bed. He is stroking her cheeks and her hair and tenderly trying to intercept the gaze of her averted eyes. Oh, this is only half of the former Versilov: this man refuses to be parted from Mother, and I know he'll never leave her again. He even ""received his reward in tears,"" as Makar put it in his story about the merchant; I believe, though, that Versilov still has a long time to live. With the rest of us, he is now as sincere and unaffected as a small child, although he never loses a dignified restraint and never says anything he feels he shouldn't. His intelligence and his moral standards have remained unchanged, while his striving for an ideal has become even stronger. Personally, I've never loved him more than I do now, and I'm only sorry that I have neither the time nor the space to say more about him. Nevertheless, I'll tell one recent episode among many such. By Lent he had quite recovered and during the sixth week he announced he was going to fast. I don't believe he'd fasted before that for thirty years or more. Mother was very pleased. They started, then, preparing lenten dishes, but rather expensive and refined ones. All Monday and Tuesday I heard him singing in his room ""The Bridegroom Cometh,"" and I enjoyed both the tune and the verses tremendously. During those two days he spoke very eloquently about religion, but then on Wednesday he suddenly broke his fast. Something had irritated him unexpectedly, something that he described laughingly as ""an amusing incongruity. "" Something about the way the priest looked or the way the service was conducted had displeased him, and when he returned home he told us with a quiet smile: ""I do love God very much, my friends, but I simply have no talent for these things."" That day roast beef was served for dinner. I know that now Mother often sits down next to him and, smiling meekly, starts talking to him in a quiet voice, sometimes on the most abstract subjects. Now she somehow ""dares"" to talk to him about those things, although I don't know when or how this happened. Most often she talks to him in whispers. He listens to her with a smile, strokes her hair, kisses her hands. True happiness radiates from his face. Sometimes he gets into strange, almost hysterical states. Thus he may take the photograph of Mother—the one I'd seen him kiss once —look at it with tears in his eyes, kiss it, plunge into his memories, and call us all to him. But, at such moments, he talks very little. He has never spoken of Katerina, never mentioned her name. Indeed, it's as though he's forgotten about her altogether. Nor has he ever said a word about marrying Mother. During the summer there was talk of taking him abroad for a cure, but Mrs. Prutkov decided there was no need for that. Besides, he didn't want to go himself. Now they're planning to spend the summer somewhere in the countryside outside Petersburg. By the way, for the time being, we're all living on Mrs. Prutkov's money, and at this point I'd like to say that I'm sorry now that in the course of these notes I have allowed myself to make some disrespectful and even scornful remarks about that lady. But when I made those remarks, I became in my imagination exactly the individual I had been at the moment I was describing; and now, as I have finished these memoirs, I feel that if I have succeeded in re-educating myself, it was precisely through the process of remembering and noting down my recollections just as they came. I now no longer agree with many of the things I've written and, specifically, with the general tone and wording of certain passages. Nevertheless, I refuse to change one word or to delete anything.","His wound proved to be not a fatal one, and it healed, but he was ill in bed rather a long time, at mother's, of course. Now as I am writing these lines it is the middle of May, an exquisite spring day, and our windows are open. Mother is sitting beside him: he strokes her cheeks and hair and gazes into her face with tender emotion. Oh, this is only the half of the old Versilov, he never leaves mother's side now, and will never leave her again. He has even gained the ""gift of tears,"" as Makar Ivanovitch, of precious memory, said in his story about the merchant. I fancy, however, that Versilov has a long life before him. With us he is perfectly good-natured and candid as a child, though he never loses his sense of proportion and self-control, and does not talk too freely. All his intellect and his moral nature have remained unchanged, though all his ideal side has become more marked. I may say frankly that I have never loved him so much as now, and I regret that I have neither time nor space to say more about him. I will, however, tell one recent anecdote about him (and there are many). He had quite recovered by Lent, and in the sixth week declared that he would fast and take the sacrament. He had not taken the sacrament for thirty years or more I believe. Mother was delighted; they began preparing Lenten dishes, rather expensive, dainty ones, however. In the next room I heard him on Monday and Tuesday chanting to himself ""The Bridegroom cometh,"" and he was delighted with the verses and the chant. He spoke beautifully of religion several times during those days; but on Wednesday the fast suddenly came to an end. Something suddenly irritated him, some ""amusing contrast,"" as he expressed it, laughing; he disliked something in the exterior of the priest, in the surroundings; whatever it was, he returned and said with a gentle smile: ""My friends, I love God, but I am not fitted for that. "" The same day roast beef was served at dinner. But I know that even now mother often sits beside him, and in a low voice, with a gentle smile, begins to talk to him of the most abstract subjects: now she has somehow grown DARING with him, but how this has come to pass I don't know. She sits beside him and speaks to him usually in a whisper. He listens with a smile, strokes her hair, kisses her hand, and there is the light of perfect happiness in his face. He sometimes has attacks that are almost like hysterics. Then he takes her photograph, the one he kissed that evening, gazes at it with tears, kisses it, recalls the past, gathers us all round him, but at such moments he says little. Katerina Nikolaevna he seems to have completely forgotten and has never once mentioned. Nothing has been said of marriage with my mother so far, either. They did think of taking him abroad for the summer; but Tatyana Pavlovna strongly opposed it, and he did not desire it himself. They will spend the summer at a villa, in some country place in the neighbourhood of Petersburg. By the way we are all still living at the expense of Tatyana Pavlovna. One thing I will add: I am dreadfully sorry that I have several times in this narrative allowed myself to take up a disrespectful and superior attitude in regard to Versilov. But as I wrote I imagined myself precisely at each of the moments I was describing. As I finish my narrative and write the last lines, I suddenly feel by the very process of recalling and recording, I have re-educated myself. I regret a great deal I have written, especially the tone of certain sentences and pages, but I will not cross them out or correct a single word."
"Крафт слушал, слегка улыбаясь, и произнес наконец, как бы с несколько измученным видом, впрочем с сильною искренностью:","Kraft listened, smiling slightly, and finally said, as if with a somewhat tormented look, but with great sincerity:","Kraft listened with a wan smile and finally said with a pained look, sounding absolutely sincere:","Kraft listened with a faint smile and brought out at last with a somewhat harassed face, but with earnest sincerity:"

Yes, of course, I stayed there fully realizing that I was eavesdropping, violating other people's secrets! But how could I not have stayed with that double in there, that double who had smashed the icon before my very eyes!","I remained; she went away. Of course, I remained.

"Я не нашел нужным скрывать и, почти в раздражении на Версилова, передал все о вчерашнем письме к нему Катерины Николаевны и об эффекте письма, то есть о воскресении его в новую жизнь. К удивлению моему, факт письма ее нимало не удивил, и я догадался, что она уже о нем знала.","I did not find it necessary to hide it, and, almost irritated with Versilov, I conveyed everything about Katerina Nikolaevna's letter to him yesterday and about the effect of the letter, that is, about his resurrection into a new life. To my surprise, the fact of the letter did not surprise her in the least, and I guessed that she already knew about it.","There was no reason for me to hide anything from her and, feeling somehow unaccountably irritated with Versilov, I told her about the letter he'd received from Mrs. Akhmakov, about the moral regeneration it had brought about in him, and about the new life he'd resolved to begin now. To my amazement, I saw she didn't react at all when I mentioned the letter and realized she must have known about it already.","I told her all about Katerina Nikolaevna's letter to him the day before and of the effect of the letter, that is of his resurrection into a new life. To my amazement the fact of the letter did not surprise her in the least, and I guessed that she knew of it already."
"Я смотрел, выпуча глаза. Вдруг что-то даже меня сожалеющее мелькнуло в его гадком взгляде:","I watched with bulging eyes. Suddenly, something even pitying me flickered in his nasty look:",I was gaping at him in bewilderment and suddenly discerned something that might have been a glimmer of pity in his loathsome look.,I gazed at him open-eyed. There was a sudden glimpse of something like compassion for me in his loathsome eyes:
"Мало-помалу Лиза пришла к заключению, что и к князю он относится снисходительно, может, потому лишь, что для него все равны и «не существует различий», а вовсе не из симпатии к ней. Но под конец он как-то видимо стал терять свое равнодушие и к князю начал относиться не только с осуждением, но и с презрительной иронией. Это разгорячило Лизу, но Васин не унялся. Главное, он всегда выражался так мягко, даже и осуждал без негодования, а просто лишь логически выводил о всей ничтожности ее героя; но в этой-то логичности и заключалась ирония. Наконец, почти прямо вывел перед нею всю «неразумность» ее любви, всю упрямую насильственность этой любви. «Вы в своих чувствах заблудились, а заблуждения, раз сознанные, должны быть непременно исправлены».","Little by little, Lisa came to the conclusion that he treated the prince indulgently, perhaps only because for him everyone is equal and ""there are no differences,"" and not at all out of sympathy for her. But in the end, he somehow apparently began to lose his indifference and began to treat the prince not only with condemnation, but also with contemptuous irony. This inflamed Lisa, but Vassin did not let up. The main thing is that he always expressed himself so gently, even condemning without indignation, but simply only logically deducing about all the insignificance of her hero; but there was an irony in this logic. Finally, he brought out almost directly before her all the ""unreasonableness"" of her love, all the stubborn violence of this love. “You are lost in your feelings, and delusions, once recognized, must certainly be corrected.”","Little by little Lisa decided that even Vasin's tolerant attitude toward Sergei did not come from his sympathy for her, but simply because he saw no difference between one person and another and everybody was the same to him. In the end, however, he did slip out of his indifference a little and when he spoke of Sergei she detected in his words not only a note of disapproval but even a tinge of irony. That visibly annoyed Lisa, but Vasin persisted. What exasperated her most was that he still never departed from his calm tone and there was no trace of indignation in what he said about Sergei: he simply reasoned logically and arrived at the conclusion that Lisa's hero was worthless, and it was his logical detachment that made his irony so exasperating. And then, one day, he practically proved to her the ""irrationality"" of her love for Sergei, showing her how and where it violated the law of reason. ""You're mistaken about your own feelings,"" he concluded, ""but once you understand where you went wrong, everything can be corrected.""","Little by little Liza came also to the conclusion that his indulgent attitude to Prince Sergay was not due to sympathy for her, but was perhaps only because ""all were alike to him, and differences did not exist for him."" But in the end he did apparently begin to lose his indifference, and to take up an attitude not only of disapproval, but even of contemptuous irony towards Prince Sergay. This incensed Liza, but Vassin remained unaffected. Above all, he always expressed himself gently, and showed no indignation even in his disapproval, but confined himself to logical exposition of her hero's worthlessness; but there was irony in this very logic. Finally he demonstrated almost directly the ""irrationality,"" the perverse violence of her love. ""Your feelings have been mistaken, and a mistake once recognized ought invariably to be corrected."""
"Князь был действительно нездоров и сидел дома один с обвязанной мокрым полотенцем головой. Он очень ждал меня; но не голова одна у него болела, а скорее он весь был болен нравственно. Предупреждаю опять: во все это последнее время, и вплоть до катастрофы, мне как-то пришлось встречаться сплошь с людьми, до того возбужденными, что все они были чуть не помешанные, так что я сам поневоле должен был как бы заразиться. Я, признаюсь, пришел с дурными чувствами, да и стыдно мне было очень того, что я вчера перед ним расплакался. Да и все-таки они так ловко с Лизой сумели меня обмануть, что я не мог же не видеть в себе глупца. Словом, когда я вошел к нему, в душе моей звучали фальшивые струны. Но все это напускное и фальшивое соскочило быстро. Я должен отдать ему справедливость: как скоро падала и разбивалась его мнительность, то он уже отдавался окончательно; в нем сказывались черты почти младенческой ласковости, доверчивости и любви. Он со слезами поцеловал меня и тотчас же начал говорить о деле… Да, я действительно был ему очень нужен: в словах его и в течении идей было чрезвычайно много беспорядка.","The prince was really unwell and sat at home alone with his head tied with a wet towel. He was waiting for me very much; but it was not only his head that ached, but rather he was morally ill all over. I warn you again: in all this recent time, and right up to the catastrophe, I somehow had to meet entirely with people who were so excited that they were all almost crazy, so that I myself had to somehow become infected. I confess, I came with bad feelings, and I was very ashamed that I burst into tears in front of him yesterday. And yet they and Liza managed to deceive me so cleverly that I couldn't help but see myself as a fool. In a word, when I went to him, false strings sounded in my soul. But all this pretense and false jumped off quickly. I must do him justice: as soon as his suspiciousness fell and broke, he already surrendered completely; it showed features of almost infantile tenderness, gullibility and love. He kissed me with tears and immediately began to talk about the matter ... Yes, he really needed me very much: there was an extremely lot of confusion in his words and in the flow of ideas.","Sergei really wasn't feeling well, and he was sitting at home all alone with a wet towel wrapped around his head. But it was mental agony rather than an ordinary headache. He had been anxiously awaiting my arrival. Once again I must warn the reader that, during that whole time and right up until the catastrophe, I somehow had to deal with people who were all in a state of extreme agitation bordering on real insanity, which couldn't help, as it were, rubbing off on me somewhat. I admit that I felt quite antagonistic toward Sergei when I arrived, and I felt very ashamed of having allowed myself to burst into tears in his presence the day before. Besides, he and Lisa had managed to deceive me so thoroughly that I couldn't help feeling like a real fool. In short, when I marched in, all sorts of hostile feelings were churning inside me. But my planned aggressiveness vanished very quickly because, in fairness to him, it must be said that underneath his morbid suspicions was an almost childlike trustingness and love.

From what he said and how he said it, I could judge his state of inner turmoil.","Prince Sergay was really unwell, and was sitting alone with his head wrapped in a wet towel. He was very anxious to see me; but he had not only a headache, he seemed to be aching morally all over. To anticipate events again; all that latter time, right up to the catastrophe, it was somehow my fate to meet with people who were one after another so excited that they were all almost mad, so that I couldn't help being infected with the same malady myself. I came, I must confess, with evil feelings in my heart, and I was horribly ashamed, too, of having cried before him the previous night. And anyway Liza and he had so clearly succeeded in deceiving me that I could not help seeing myself as a fool. In short, my heart was vibrating on false notes as I went in. But all this affectation and false feeling vanished quickly. I must do him the justice to say that his suspiciousness had quickly disappeared, that he surrendered himself completely; he betrayed almost childish affection, confidence and love. He kissed me with tears and at once began talking of the position… . Yes, he really did need me: his words and the sequence of his ideas betrayed great mental disorder."

"Возопила мать со птенцами, выгнал сирот из дому, и не по злобе токмо, а и сам не знает иной раз человек, по какому побуждению стоит на своем. Ну, помогали сперва, а потом пошла наниматься в работу. Да только какой у нас, окромя фабрики, заработок; там полы вымоет, там в огороде выполет, там баньку вытопит, да с ребеночком-то на руках и взвоет; а четверо прочих тут же по улице в рубашонках бегают. Когда на коленки их у паперти ставила, все еще в башмачонках были, каких ни есть, да в салопчиках, все как ни есть, а купецкие дети; а тут уж пошли бегать и босенькие: на ребенке одежонка горит, известно. Ну, а деткам что: было бы солнышко, радуются, гибели не чувствуют, словно птички, голосочки их что колокольчики.

Well, they helped at first, and then went to get hired. Yes, but what kind of earnings do we have, besides the factories; there he will wash the floors, there he will fly out in the garden, there he will heat a bathhouse, and with a baby in his arms he will howl; and four others are running down the street in shirts. When she put them on their knees at the porch, they were still in slippers, whatever they were, but in cloaks, everything was as it was, but merchant children; and then the barefoot ones went running: the child’s clothes are on fire, you know. Well, what about the children: there would be sunshine, they rejoice, they don’t feel death, like birds, their voices are like bells. The widow thinks: “Winter will come, and where will I put you then; if only God had taken you by that time!” Just don't wait until winter. In our place there is such a cough for children, whooping cough, which passes from one to another. First of all, the baby girl died, and the others fell ill after her, and all four girls, in the same autumn, were demolished one by one. One, however, was crushed by horses in the street. What do you think? She buried her and howled; then she cursed, but when God took it away, it became a pity. Mother's heart!","So the mother could only weep as Maxim turned her out of her house with her little orphans. But it was not really out of spite that he'd done it , for often a man doesn't know himself why he insists on doing certain things. Well, other people helped her at first and then she went out looking for work. But what work could she hope to find around Afimievsk except on the cotton mill grounds? There she could scrub the floors, weed the vegetable garden, heat the bathhouse, while still keeping an eye on her baby and the other four children who ran around outside the buildings in their little shirts. When she'd lined them all up by the church door, the children still had some sort of shoes on their feet and jackets that still looked like jackets, for they were not peasants after all but the children of a merchant. However, everybody knows how a child burns up clothes and now they had to run around barefoot with just their shirts on their backs. But you know how children are: they don't mind; as long as the sun is shining, they don't feel their misery; they're happy like little birds and their voices sound like jingle bells. The widow, she kept worrying though: ""What will I do with all my little ones when winter comes? I pray God will call them to Him by then. "" But she didn't have to wait for winter. In our part of the country there's a whooping cough that goes around sometimes and then it skips from one child to another. First it was the baby that died and then, one after the other, the rest of the little girls fell ill and they all died in turns during the fall, although one of them didn't actually die of the sickness but was run over by a cart in the street. So what do you think? She buried them and wept and wailed. She'd cursed her children herself, but now that God had taken them, she missed them badly. That's a mother's heart for you!","The mother wailed with her nurselings. He turned the orphans out of the house, and not from spite only, for, indeed, a man sometimes does not know himself what drives him to carry out his will. Well, people helped her at first and then she went out to work for hire. But there was little to be earned, save at the factory; she scrubs floors, weeds in the garden, heats the bath-house, and she carries the babe in her arms, and the other four run about the streets in their little shirts. When she made them kneel down at the church porch they still had little shoes, and little jackets of a sort, for they were merchant's children but now they began to run barefoot. A child soon gets through its little clothes we know. Well, the children didn't care: so long as there was sunshine they rejoiced, like birds, did not feel their ruin, and their voices were like little bells. The widow thought ""the winter will come and what shall I do with you then? If God would only take you to Him before then!"" But she had not to wait for the winter. About our parts the children have a cough, the whooping-cough, which goes from one to the other. First of all the baby died, and after her the others fell ill, and all four little girls she buried that autumn one after the other; one of them, it's true, was trampled by the horses in the street. And what do you think? She buried them and she wailed. Though she had cursed them, yet when God took them she was sorry. A mother's heart!"

"Для меня по крайней мере первым вопросом, и тогда и еще долго спустя, было: как мог Версилов соединиться с таким, как Ламберт, и какую цель он имел тогда в виду? Мало-помалу я пришел к некоторому разъяснению: по-моему, Версилов в те мгновения, то есть в тот весь последний день и накануне, не мог иметь ровно никакой твердой цели и даже, я думаю, совсем тут и не рассуждал, а был под влиянием какого-то вихря чувств. Впрочем, настоящего сумасшествия я не допускаю вовсе, тем более что он – и теперь вовсе не сумасшедший. Но «двойника» допускаю несомненно. Что такое, собственно, двойник? Двойник, по крайней мере по одной медицинской книге одного эксперта, которую я потом нарочно прочел, двойник – это есть не что иное, как первая ступень некоторого серьезного уже расстройства души, которое может повести к довольно худому концу. Да и сам Версилов в сцене у мамы разъяснил нам это тогдашнее «раздвоение» его чувств и воли с страшною искренностью. Но опять-таки повторю: та сцена у мамы, тот расколотый образ хоть бесспорно произошли под влиянием настоящего двойника, но мне всегда с тех пор мерещилось, что отчасти тут и некоторая злорадная аллегория, некоторая как бы ненависть к ожиданиям этих женщин, некоторая злоба к их правам и к их суду, и вот он, пополам с двойником, и разбил этот образ! «Так, дескать, расколются и ваши ожидания!» Одним словом, если и был двойник, то была и просто блажь… Но все это – только моя догадка; решить же наверно – трудно.","For me, at least, the first question, both then and for a long time after, was: how could Versilov unite with someone like Lambert, and what purpose did he have in mind then? Little by little, I came to a certain explanation: in my opinion, Versilov in those moments, that is, on that whole last day and the day before, could not have exactly any firm goal, and even, I think, did not reason at all here, but was under the influence of some whirlwind of feelings. However, I do not allow real madness at all, especially since he is not at all crazy now. But I certainly admit the “double”. What exactly is a doppelgänger? A double, according to at least one medical book by one expert, which I then purposely read, a double is nothing more than the first stage of some already serious mental disorder, which can lead to a rather worse end. And Versilov himself, in the scene at his mother's, explained to us this ""split"" of his feelings and will at that time with terrible sincerity. But again, I repeat: that scene at my mother’s, that split image, although undoubtedly occurred under the influence of a real double, but it always seemed to me since then that partly there was some malicious allegory here, some sort of hatred for the expectations of these women, some malice towards their rights and their judgment, and here he is, in half with a double, and broke this image! “So, they say, your expectations will also split!” In a word, if there was a double, then it was just a whim ... But all this is just my guess; it's probably hard to decide.","At the time, as well as for quite a while afterward, what puzzled me most was how Versilov could have brought himself to associate with someone like Lambert and also what he had been trying to achieve by the association. Gradually, I found some sort of explanation. I don't think that, during the final scene at Mrs. Prutkov's or even on the previous day, Versilov could have had any clear objective in mind at all. I'd even say that he wasn't reasoning but was acting directly under the impact of a whirl of emotions. However, I definitely deny that he was ever really insane, especially since today he may be described as anything but insane. But I do accept fully the hypothesis of the presence of a ""double."" What does it actually mean, a ""double""? According to a medical treatise that I read later while doing some research on the subject, such a ""double"" is the first stage of a specific nervous disorder, a rather serious disorder that may lead to a very tragic end. Moreover, Versilov himself had explained to us with terrifying frankness the split between his feelings and his will when he'd broken the icon at Mother's. But, on the other hand, I must repeat that his smashing of the icon, although certainly done under the influence of his ""double,"" still was loaded with—I always felt—a sort of wicked symbolism, a spiteful irritation at these women who expected him to act in a certain way, an impatience with them for making certain claims on him and with their right to judge him. And so, acting jointly with his ""double,"" he picked up the icon and smashed it in two! Or, to put it simply, even if a ""double"" was involved, it was, at the same time, also a whim. . . . But all this is only conjecture; I have no definite explanation.","To me at least, the first question at the time, and long afterwards was: how Versilov could have brought himself to act in concert with a man like Lambert, and what were his objects in doing so? Little by little, I have arrived at an explanation of a sort; to my thinking, at those moments, that is, all that last day and the day before, Versilov can have had no definite aim, and I believe, indeed, he did not reflect on the matter at all, but acted under the influence of a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. But the theory of actual madness I cannot accept, especially as he is not in the least mad now. But the ""second self"" I do accept unquestionably. What is a second self exactly? The second self, according to a medical book, written by an expert, which I purposely read afterwards, is nothing else than the first stage of serious mental derangement, which may lead to something very bad. And in that scene at my mother's, Versilov himself had with strange frankness described the ""duality"" of his will and feelings. But I repeat again: though that scene at mother's and that broken ikon were undoubtedly partly due to the influence of a real ""second self,"" yet I have ever since been haunted by the fancy that there was in it an element of a sort of vindictive symbolism, a sort of resentment against the expectations of those women, a sort of angry revolt against their rights and their criticism. And so hand in hand with the ""second self"" he broke the ikon, as though to say ""that's how your expectations will be shattered!"" In fact, even though the ""second self"" did come in, it was partly simply a whim… . But all this is only my theory; it would be hard to decide for certain."

"Утро было холодное, и на всем лежал сырой молочный туман. Не знаю почему, но раннее деловое петербургское утро, несмотря на чрезвычайно скверный свой вид, мне всегда нравится, и весь этот спешащий по своим делам, эгоистический и всегда задумчивый люд имеет для меня, в восьмом часу утра, нечто особенно привлекательное. Особенно я люблю дорогой, спеша, или сам что-нибудь у кого спросить по делу, или если меня кто об чем-нибудь спросит: и вопрос и ответ всегда кратки, ясны, толковы, задаются не останавливаясь и всегда почти дружелюбны, а готовность ответить наибольшая во дню. Петербуржец, среди дня или к вечеру, становится менее сообщителен и, чуть что, готов и обругать или насмеяться; совсем другое рано поутру, еще до дела, в самую трезвую и серьезную пору. Я это заметил.","The morning was cold, and a damp milky mist lay over everything. I don’t know why, but I always like an early business morning in St. Petersburg, despite its extremely nasty appearance, and all this selfish and always thoughtful people hurrying about their business has something especially attractive for me at eight o’clock in the morning. I especially love the road, in a hurry, or myself to ask someone something on business, or if someone asks me about something: both the question and the answer are always short, clear, sensible, asked without stopping and always almost friendly, and the readiness to answer largest in the day. A Petersburger, in the middle of the day or towards evening, becomes less sociable and, at the slightest sign, is ready to scold or laugh; quite another early in the morning, even before work, at the most sober and serious time. I noticed it.","It was a cold morning and a damp, milky mist weighed down on everything in sight. I can't explain why, but I always enjoy the early weekday Petersburg mornings, grim as they may be, with all those hurried self-centered people, each immersed in his own personal preoccupations; they somehow fascinate me at eight o'clock in the morning. What I like most, as I hurry to my destination, is to stop briefly to ask some information of one of those hurrying figures, or to be asked for directions by a passer-by; both the question and the answer are always brief and to the point, indeed, sometimes exchanged without stopping, almost always friendly, the willingness to answer being at its highest point of the day. A Petersburg denizen becomes less and less communicative as the day wears on and, toward evening, is prepared to be rude and even scoff at you at the slightest provocation. But it's quite different in the early morning before work, in those sober and most clear-headed moments. That's what I have observed at least.","It was a cold morning and a damp, milky mist hovered over everything. I don't know why, but I always like the early workaday morning in Petersburg in spite of its squalid air; and the self- centred people, always absorbed in thought, and hurrying on their affairs, have a special attraction for me at eight o'clock in the morning. As I hasten on my road I particularly like either asking some one a practical question, or being asked one by some passer- by: both question and answer are always brief, clear, and to the point; they are spoken without stopping and almost always in a friendly manner, and there is a greater readiness to answer than at any other hour. In the middle of the day, or in the evening, the Petersburger is far more apt to be abusive or jeering. It is quite different early in the morning, before work has begun, at the soberest and most serious hour of the day. I have noticed that."

"Если б у меня был читатель и прочел все то, что я уже написал о моих приключениях, то, нет сомнения, ему нечего было бы объяснять, что я решительно не создан для какого бы то ни было общества. Главное, я никак не умею держать себя в обществе. Когда я куда вхожу, где много народу, мне всегда чувствуется, что все взгляды меня электризуют. Меня решительно начинает коробить, коробить физически, даже в таких местах, как в театре, а уж не говорю в частных домах. На всех этих рулетках и сборищах я решительно не умел приобрести себе никакой осанки: то сижу и упрекаю себя за излишнюю мягкость и вежливость, то вдруг встану и сделаю какую-нибудь грубость. А между тем какие негодяи, сравнительно со мной, умели там держать себя с удивительной осанкой – и вот это-то и бесило меня пуще всего, так что я все больше и больше терял хладнокровие. Скажу прямо, не только теперь, но и тогда уже мне все это общество, да и самый выигрыш, если уж все говорить, стало, наконец, отвратительно и мучительно. Решительно – мучительно. Я, конечно, испытывал наслаждение чрезвычайное, но наслаждение это проходило чрез мучение; все это, то есть эти люди, игра и, главное, я сам вместе с ними, казалось мне страшно грязным. «Только что выиграю и тотчас на все плюну!» – каждый раз говорил я себе, засыпая на рассвете у себя на квартире после ночной игры. И опять-таки этот выигрыш: взять уж то, что я вовсе не любил деньги. То есть я не стану повторять гнусной казенщины, обыкновенной в этих объяснениях, что я играл, дескать, для игры, для ощущений, для наслаждений риска, азарта и проч., а вовсе не для барыша. Мне деньги были нужны ужасно, и хоть это был и не мой путь, не моя идея, но так или этак, а я тогда все-таки решил попробовать, в виде опыта, и этим путем. Тут все сбивала меня одна сильная мысль: «Ведь уж ты вывел, что миллионщиком можешь стать непременно, лишь имея соответственно сильный характер; ведь уж ты пробы делал характеру; так покажи себя и здесь: неужели у рулетки нужно больше характеру, чем для твоей идеи?» – вот что я повторял себе. А так как я и до сих пор держусь убеждения, что в азартной игре, при полном спокойствии характера, при котором сохранилась бы вся тонкость ума и расчета, невозможно не одолеть грубость слепого случая и не выиграть – то, естественно, я должен был тогда все более и более раздражаться, видя, что поминутно не выдерживаю характера и увлекаюсь, как совершенный мальчишка. «Я, могший выдержать голод, я не могу выдержать себя на такой глупости!» – вот что дразнило меня. К тому же сознание, что у меня, во мне, как бы я ни казался смешон и унижен, лежит то сокровище силы, которое заставит их всех когда-нибудь изменить обо мне мнение, это сознание – уже с самых почти детских униженных лет моих – составляло тогда единственный источник жизни моей, мой свет и мое достоинство, мое оружие и мое утешение, иначе я бы, может быть, убил себя еще ребенком. А потому, мог ли я не быть раздражен на себя, видя, в какое жалкое существо обращаюсь я за игорным столом? Вот почему я уж и не мог отстать от игры: теперь я все это ясно вижу. Кроме этого, главного, страдало и мелочное самолюбие: проигрыш унижал меня перед князем, перед Версиловым, хотя тот ничего не удостоивал говорить, перед всеми, даже перед Татьяной, – так мне казалось, чувствовалось. Наконец, сделаю и еще признание: я уже тогда развратился; мне уже трудно было отказаться от обеда в семь блюд в ресторане, от Матвея, от английского магазина, от мнения моего парфюмера, ну и от всего этого. Я сознавал это и тогда, но только отмахивался рукой; теперь же, записывая, краснею.","If I had a reader and read all that I have already written about my adventures, then, no doubt, he would have nothing to explain that I am definitely not created for any kind of society. The main thing is that I don't know how to behave in society. When I go somewhere, where there are a lot of people, I always feel that all the views electrify me. It definitely starts to jar me, jarring physically, even in such places as in the theater, let alone in private homes. At all these roulettes and gatherings, I definitely did not know how to acquire any posture for myself: now I sit and reproach myself for being too soft and polite, then I suddenly get up and do some rudeness. And meanwhile, what scoundrels, in comparison with me, knew how to behave there with amazing posture - and this was what infuriated me the most, so that I more and more lost my composure. I will say frankly, not only now, but even then, all this society, and even the gain itself, if everything is to be said, finally became disgusting and painful for me. Definitely painful. Of course, I experienced extreme pleasure, but this pleasure passed through torment; all this, that is, these people, the game, and, most importantly, myself along with them, seemed to me terribly dirty. “I’ll just win and immediately spit on everything!” - every time I said to myself, falling asleep at dawn in my apartment after a night of playing. And again this gain: take the fact that I did not like money at all. That is, I will not repeat the vile treasury common in these explanations that I played, they say, for the game, for sensations, for the enjoyment of risk, excitement, etc., and not at all for profit. I needed the money terribly, and even though it was not my way, not my idea, but one way or another, but then I still decided to try, in the form of experience, and this way. Here one strong thought kept knocking me down: “After all, you already deduced that you can certainly become a millionaire only if you have a correspondingly strong character; after all, you already made tests of character; so show yourself here too: does roulette really need more character than your idea?” - that's what I kept repeating to myself. And since I still hold the conviction that in gambling, with complete calmness of character, in which all the subtlety of the mind and calculation would be preserved, it is impossible not to overcome the rudeness of blind chance and not win - then, naturally, I had to then all more and more irritated, seeing that every minute I can’t stand my temper and get carried away like a perfect boy. “I, who could endure hunger, I can’t stand myself on such stupidity!” - that's what teased me. In addition, the consciousness that I, in me, no matter how ridiculous and humiliated I may seem, lies that treasure of power that will make them all someday change their minds about me, this consciousness - already from my most almost childish humiliated years - was then the only source of my life, my light and my dignity, my weapon and my consolation, otherwise I might have killed myself as a child. And therefore, how could I not be irritated with myself, seeing what a pitiful creature I turn at the gambling table? That is why I could not fall behind the game: now I see it all clearly. In addition to this, the main thing, petty pride also suffered: the loss humiliated me in front of the prince, in front of Versilov, although he did not deign to say anything, in front of everyone, even in front of Tatyana - it seemed to me, I felt it. Finally, I will make another confession: I had already become depraved; it was already difficult for me to refuse a seven-course dinner in a restaurant, from Matvey, from an English store, from the opinion of my perfumer, and of all this. I was aware of this even then, but only waved my hand away; now, as I write, I blush.","If someone should read what I've written thus far of my adventures, he certainly wouldn't have to be told that I'm not well fitted for social life of any kind. Above all, I don't know how to behave in company. Whenever I enter a place where many people are assembled, the eyes directed at me give me the sensation of so many electric shocks. It makes me shrivel— I mean it literally, in the physical sense. And it happens to me even if I enter a theater, to say nothing of a private house. In all those gambling houses and dens, I'd been quite unable to acquire poise: either I'd sit still and reproach myself for excessive meekness and mildness or I'd leap up and do something downright rude. At the same time, I realized that people who were unquestionably my inferiors knew how to behave with amazing dignity, and that drove me into a fury and made me lose my self-control even more. So I can truly say that not only now but even then all this crowd and, indeed, the very prospect of winning became, in the end, both repulsive and painful. Yes, actually painful. Of course, I did derive extreme pleasure from gambling, but that pleasure had to pass through much pain before it reached me because the whole process—I mean the gambling itself, all those people, and above all myself—seemed horribly disgusting to me. ""As soon as I win, I'll never do it again—to hell with it!"" I would repeat to myself at dawn every time as I was slipping into sleep at home after a night of gambling. And, again, how can I account for my gambling mania since I certainly was not crazy about money? Of course, I'm not going to reel off here the stupid string of cliches so often given as explanations of why people gamble—not for the sake of money but rather for the strong sensations, the thrill of risk, excitement, etc. No, I needed money quite desperately at that time and I decided to try to get it that way, as a sort of experiment. In this I was following the ""idea"" that dominated me: Since I had already concluded that one can unfailingly become a millionaire provided one has an appropriately strong character, since I had already tested my strength of character, why shouldn't I also test it through gambling? I cannot believe that gambling requires more character than my idea! And that was the reasoning I kept repeating to myself. To this day I firmly believe that in gambling complete calm and self-control, which enable one to preserve subtle thinking and careful calculation, will always overcome the crudeness of blind chance. And so, of course, I grew more and more exasperated with myself, realizing that I kept showing a lack of character, losing self-control, and giving in to the excitement like a miserable schoolboy. The thought that I, who had been able to withstand hunger, couldn't remain master of myself during such an easy test of will depressed me no end. Above all, my notion that, however ridiculous and pitiful I might appear, I possessed a hidden strength that one day would force everybody to change his opinion of me, the notion that had been with me since my unhappy childhood and my only source of life, hope, dignity, and consolation, was so indispensable to me that, without it, I'd have put an end to my life when I was still a little boy. So how could I help being exasperated with myself when I realized into what a helpless creature gambling could turn me? And that's why I couldn't give up gambling. I understand it very clearly now. And, of course, to that must be added petty vanity. My constant losing humiliated me, made me feel ashamed before Sergei, before Versilov (although Versilov never deigned to talk about it), before everyone, even that woman Tatyana Prutkov! At least that's how I felt at the time. Finally, I must admit that, the life of luxury had already quite corrupted me: I found it hard to forego a seven-course dinner at a fashionable restaurant, to give up Matvei or patronizing the store selling imported English goods, or to jeopardize the good opinion of my French barber. I was conscious of this even at the time, but I dismissed the thought as nonsense and refused to dwell on it. But now, as I write, my cheeks are red from shame.","If I had a reader and he had read all I have written so far of my adventures, there would be certainly no need to inform him that I am not created for any sort of society. The trouble is I don't know how to behave in company. If I go anywhere among a great many people I always have a feeling as though I were being electrified by so many eyes looking at me. It positively makes me shrivel up, physically shrivel up, even in such places as a theatre, to say nothing of private houses. I did not know how to behave with dignity in these gambling saloons and assemblies; I either sat still, inwardly upbraiding myself for my excessive mildness and politeness, or I suddenly got up and did something rude. And meanwhile all sorts of worthless fellows far inferior to me knew how to behave with wonderful aplomb—and that's what exasperated me above everything, so that I lost my self-possession more and more. I may say frankly, even at that time, if the truth is to be told, the society there, and even winning money at cards, had become revolting and a torture to me. Positively a torture. I did, of course, derive acute enjoyment from it, but this enjoyment was at the cost of torture: the whole thing, the people, the gambling, and, most of all, myself in the midst of them, seemed horribly nasty. ""As soon as I win I'll chuck it all up!"" I said to myself every time when I woke up in my lodgings in the morning after gambling over night. Then, again, how account for my desire to win, since I certainly was not fond of money? Not that I am going to repeat the hackneyed phrases usual in such explanations, that I played for the sake of the game, for the pleasure of it, for the risk, the excitement and so on, and not for gain. I was horribly in need of money, and though this was not my chosen path, not my idea, yet somehow or other I had made up my mind to try it by way of experiment. I was continually possessed by one overwhelming thought: ""You maintained that one could reckon with certainty on becoming a millionaire if only one had sufficient strength of will; you've tested your strength of will already; so show yourself as strong in this case: can more strength of will be needed for roulette than for your idea?"" that is what I kept repeating to myself. And as I still retain the conviction, that in games of chance, if one has perfect control of one's will, so that the subtlety of one's intelligence and one's power of calculation are preserved, one cannot fail to overcome the brutality of blind chance and to win, I naturally could not help growing more and more irritated when at every moment I failed to preserve my strength of will and was carried away by excitement, like a regular child. "" Though I was able to endure hunger, I am not able to control myself in an absurd thing like this!"" that was what provoked me. Moreover, the consciousness that however absurd and abject I might seem, I had within me a rich store of strength which would one day make them all change their opinion of me, that consciousness has been from the days of my oppressed childhood the one spring of life for me, my light, my dignity, my weapon and my consolation, without which I might have committed suicide as a little child. And so how could I help being irritated when I saw what a pitiful creature I became at the gambling table? That is why I could not give up playing! I see it all clearly now. This was the chief reason, but apart from that my petty vanity was wounded. Losing had lowered me in the eyes of Prince Sergay, of Versilov, though he did not deign to speak of it, of every one, even of Tatyana Pavlovna; that is what I thought, I felt. Finally, I will make another confession! By that time I had begun to be corrupted: it had become hard for me to give up a dinner of seven dishes at the restaurant, to give up Matvey, and the English shop, to lose the good opinion of my hairdresser, and all that, in fact. I was conscious of it even at the time, but I refused to admit the thought; now I blush to write it."

(All three of us drank, and it seems that I alone drank the whole bottle of champagne, and they only pretended.) - We will sit with Versilov in another room (Lambert, we must get another room!) - and when she suddenly agrees to everything - for a ransom in money, and for another ransom, because they are all vile, then Versilov and I will go out and convict her of how vile she is, and Versilov, seeing how vile she is, will be cured at once, and kicked her out . But here you need Björing to look at her too! I added in a frenzy.","""It's not a question of whether we could—we must get him!"" I shouted at him. "" He must be here since we're doing all this for his sake! "" I kept taking one sip after another out of my glass (I think Lambert and Alphonsine were only pretending that they were drinking with me—in reality, I must've drunk almost the whole bottle of champagne by myself). ""You must ask your landlady, Lambert, to rent us another room, and it's there that I'll be waiting with Versilov. . . . And so when she agrees to everything, I mean when she pays up the money as well as the other ransom—in kind, you know (she's sure to agree, being vile like all women)—just at that moment, Versilov and I will burst in to witness her ignominy. And Versilov, realizing how contemptible she is, will be cured of his passion for her and will throw her out. ... It would be even nicer if we could get Bjoring here too; I'd like very much to see the face he'd make!"" I added, abandoning myself to my exuberant fantasy.","""Not might, but must!"" I cried. ""It's essential! It's for his sake it's all being done! "" I explained, taking one sip after another from my glass. (We were all three drinking, while I believe I really drank the whole bottle of champagne, while they only made a show of drinking.) ""Versilov and I will sit in the next room""—(Lambert would have to take the next room!)—""and suddenly when she had agreed to everything—to paying the cash, and to his OTHER demands too, for all women were abject creatures, then Versilov and I would come in and convict her of being abject, and Versilov, seeing what a horrid woman she was, would at once be cured, and reject her with scorn. Only we ought to have Büring too, that he might see her put to shame."" ""No, we don't want Büring,"" Lambert observed."

"Тем не менее в доме от нее начался было чуть не маленький ад. Лиза, столь сильно любившая, должна была очень страдать. По характеру своему она предпочла страдать молча. Характер ее был похож на мой, то есть самовластный и гордый, и я всегда думал, и тогда и теперь, что она полюбила князя из самовластия, именно за то, что в нем не было характера и что он вполне, с первого слова и часа, подчинился ей. Это как-то само собою в сердце делается, безо всякого предварительного расчета; но такая любовь, сильная к слабому, бывает иногда несравненно сильнее и мучительнее, чем любовь равных характеров, потому что невольно берешь на себя ответственность за своего слабого друга. Я по крайней мере так думаю. Все наши, с самого начала, окружили ее самыми нежными заботами, особенно мама; но она не смягчилась, не откликнулась на участие и как бы отвергла всякую помощь. С мамой еще говорила вначале, но с каждым днем становилась скупее на слова, отрывистее и даже жестче. С Версиловым сначала советовалась, но вскоре избрала в советники и помощники Васина, как с удивлением узнал я после… Она ходила к Васину каждый день, ходила тоже по судам, по начальству князя, ходила к адвокатам, к прокурору; под конец ее почти совсем не бывало по целым дням дома. Разумеется, каждый день, раза по два, посещала и князя, который был заключен в тюрьме, в дворянском отделении, но свидания эти, как я вполне убедился впоследствии, бывали очень для Лизы тягостны. Разумеется, кто ж третий может вполне узнать дела двух любящихся? Но мне известно, что князь глубоко оскорблял ее поминутно, и чем, например? Странное дело: беспрерывною ревностью. Впрочем, об этом впоследствии; но прибавлю к этому одну мысль: трудно решить, кто из них кого мучил более. Гордившаяся между нами своим героем, Лиза относилась, может быть, совершенно иначе к нему глаз на глаз, как я подозреваю твердо, по некоторым данным, о которых, впрочем, тоже впоследствии.","Nevertheless, it almost started a little hell in the house from her. Liza, who loved so much, must have suffered greatly. By nature, she preferred to suffer in silence. Her character was similar to mine, that is, autocratic and proud, and I always thought, both then and now, that she fell in love with the prince out of autocracy, precisely because he had no character and that he was completely, from the first word and hour , obeyed her. This is somehow done by itself in the heart, without any preliminary calculation; but such love, strong for the weak, is sometimes incomparably stronger and more painful than the love of equal characters, because you involuntarily take responsibility for your weak friend. At least I think so. All of us, from the very beginning, surrounded her with the most tender cares, especially her mother; but she did not relent, did not respond to participation, and, as it were, rejected all help. I still spoke to my mother at the beginning, but every day she became sparing in words, more jerky and even tougher. At first she consulted with Versilov, but soon she elected Vasin as advisers and assistants, as I was surprised to learn later ... She went to Vassin every day, she also went to the courts, to the prince's authorities, went to lawyers, to the prosecutor; in the end, she was almost completely absent for whole days at home. Of course, every day, twice a day, she also visited the prince, who was imprisoned in the noble department, but these meetings, as I was fully convinced later, were very painful for Lisa. Of course, who is the third person who can fully know the affairs of two lovers? But I know that the prince deeply insulted her every minute, and with what, for example? Strange thing: incessant jealousy. However, more on that later; but I will add one thought to this: it is difficult to decide which of them tormented whom more. Proud of her hero between us, Liza treated him, perhaps quite differently, face to face, as I strongly suspect, according to some information, which, however, also later.","But, be that as it may, Lisa succeeded in turning the house into a sort of little hell. Her love had been great and she was bound to suffer intensely. And, by her nature, she preferred to suffer in silence. Her character resembled mine—proud and domineering—and I've always thought that it was that domineering side in her that made her love Sergei precisely because he lacked character and that, from the very first hour, after their very first words had been exchanged, he had accepted her domination. Feelings like that may spring up spontaneously in the heart without any premeditation, and the love of a strong person for a weak one is often much more powerful and much more painful than love between equals because the strong one instinctively takes upon himself the responsibility for his weaker partner. At least, that's how I see it. From the beginning, all of us, especially Mother, surrounded Lisa with loving sympathy. But Lisa not only did not respond to our warm concern for her but seemed to be exasperated by the support we were trying to offer her. At first, she still talked quite a bit to Mother, but as time passed she became less and less willing to talk at all, less and less patient, and often even brusque. In the beginning she sought some legal advice from Versilov but soon turned to Vasin for it, as I later learned to my great surprise. In fact, she went to see Vasin every day. She also spent much time in the courts, discussing Sergei's case with lawyers, arguing even with the public prosecutor. In the end, she was hardly ever at home during the day, for it goes without saying that she also visited Sergei in prison. She went daily or even twice a day to the section reserved for the gentry. As I learned later, these visits were also very painful to her. Although, it's almost impossible for a third person to understand fully the relations between two people in love, I know that Sergei was bitterly reproachful all the time, for, believe it or not, he was madly jealous! But I'll come back to that later. And so it's really hard to say which of them made the other more miserable. Thus, Lisa, who in our presence was so proud of her hero, treated him quite differently when the two of them were alone: I'm convinced of this from certain indications. But I'll come back to this point later too.","Home was beginning to be almost a little hell on account of her. Liza whose love was so intense was bound to suffer terribly. It was characteristic of her to prefer to suffer in silence. Her character was like mine, proud and domineering, and I thought then, and I think now that it was that that made her love Prince Sergay, just because he had no will at all, and that from the first word, from the first hour, he was utterly in subjection to her. This comes about of itself, in the heart, without any preliminary calculation; but such a love, the love of the strong woman for the weak man, is sometimes incomparably more intense and more agonizing than the love of equal characters, because the stronger unconsciously undertakes responsibility for the weaker. That is what I think at any rate. All the family from the first surrounded her with the tenderest care, especially mother; but Liza was not softened, she did not respond to sympathy, and seemed to repulse every sort of help. At first she did talk to mother, but every day she became more reluctant to speak, more abrupt and even more harsh. She asked Versilov's advice at first, but soon afterwards she chose Vassin for her counsellor and helper, as I learned afterwards with surprise… . She went to see Vassin every day; she went to the law courts, too, by Prince Sergay's instructions; she went to the lawyers, to the crown prosecutor; she came in the end to being absent from home for whole days together. Twice a day, of course, she visited Prince Sergay, who was in prison, in the division for noblemen, but these interviews, as I was fully convinced later, were very distressing to Liza. Of course no third person can judge of the relations of two lovers. But I know that Prince Sergay was always wounding her deeply, and by what do you suppose? Strange to say, by his continual jealousy. Of that, however, I will speak later; but I will add one thought on the subject: it would be hard to decide which of them tormented the other more. Though with us she prided herself on her hero, Liza perhaps behaved quite differently alone with him; I suspect so indeed from various facts, of which, however, I will also speak later."

"И, наконец, она просто-запросто могла захотеть побывать у Татьяны Павловны и сообщила мне вчера безо всякой цели, а я навообразил. Да и сказано было так мельком, небрежно, спокойно и после весьма скучного сеанса, потому что во все время, как я у ней был вчера, я почему-то был как сбитый с толку: сидел, мямлил и не знал, что сказать, злился и робел ужасно, а она куда-то собиралась, как вышло после, и видимо была рада, когда я стал уходить. Все эти рассуждения толпились в моей голове. Я решил наконец, что войду, позвоню, отворит кухарка, и я спрошу: «Дома Татьяна Павловна?» Коли нет дома, значит «свидание». Но я не сомневался, не сомневался!","And, finally, she could simply want to visit Tatyana Pavlovna and informed me yesterday without any purpose, but I imagined. Yes, and it was said so briefly, casually, calmly and after a very boring session, because all the time that I was with her yesterday, for some reason I was as if bewildered: I sat, mumbled and did not know what to say, got angry and was terribly shy, but she was going somewhere, as it turned out later, and apparently she was glad when I began to leave. All these thoughts crowded in my head. I finally decided that I would go in, call, the cook would open, and I would ask: “Is Tatyana Pavlovna at home?” If you are not at home, it means ""date"". But I didn't doubt it, I didn't doubt it!","Of course, she might have simply decided to drop in on Tatyana Prutkov the next day and mentioned it to me casually, without any ulterior motive, whereupon I had proceeded to imagine a whole fairy tale. Besides, she'd mentioned it fleetingly, carelessly, following a pretty dull visit during which I'd been somehow at a loss, hadn't even talked properly but had only kept mumbling, not knowing really what to say, paralyzed by shyness and furious with myself. Moreover, she'd appeared to be planning to go out that evening so she'd seemed rather pleased when I'd got up to leave. . . . All these reflections flooded my head. Finally I decided that I'd ring at the apartment door and ask the cook whether her mistress was at home. If she was out, then it was a tryst all right. But, deep down, I had no doubts whatever that it was a tryst.","And, in fact, she might simply have been going to see Tatyana Pavlovna, and have mentioned the fact to me the previous evening with no object in view, but I had misunderstood her. And, indeed, it had been said so casually, so quickly, and after a very tedious visit. I was for some reason overcome with stupidity the whole evening: I sat and mumbled, and did not know what to say, raged inwardly, and was horribly shy, and she was going out somewhere, as I learnt later, and was evidently relieved when I got up to go. All these reflections surged into my mind. I made up my mind at last that when I arrived I would ring the bell. ""The cook will open the door,"" I thought, ""and I shall ask whether Tatyana Pavlovna is at home. If she is not then it's a tryst. "" But I had no doubt of it, no doubt of it!"

"Это все точно так и было. Эта Дарья Онисимовна была мать бедной Оли, о которой я уже рассказывал и которую Татьяна Павловна приютила наконец у Столбеевой. Я отлично знал, что Лиза у Столбеевой бывала и изредка посещала потом бедную Дарью Онисимовну, которую все у нас очень полюбили; но тогда, вдруг, после этого, впрочем, чрезвычайно дельного заявления князя и особенно после глупой выходки Стебелькова, а может быть и потому, что меня сейчас назвали князем, я вдруг от всего этого весь покраснел. К счастью, в эту самую минуту встал Нащокин, чтоб уходить; он протянул руку и Дарзану. В мгновение, когда мы остались одни с Стебельковым, тот вдруг закивал мне на Дарзана, стоявшего к нам спиною, в дверях; я показал Стебелькову кулак.","It was exactly like that. This Darya Onisimovna was the mother of poor Olya, about whom I have already spoken, and whom Tatyana Pavlovna finally gave shelter to Stolbeeva.

Fortunately, at that very moment Nashchokin got up to leave; he held out his hand to Darzan too. The moment we were left alone with Stebelkov, he suddenly nodded to me at Darzan, who was standing with his back to us in the doorway; I showed Stebelkov my fist.","This was all perfectly true.

Nevertheless, Sergei's sensible explanation, perhaps because it came after Stebelkov's stupid outburst and Darzan's calling me ""prince,"" made me turn very red. Luckily, just then Nashchokin got to his feet to leave and held out his hand to Darzan. As there was no one watching Stebelkov and me for a moment, Stebelkov suddenly pointed at Darzan, who was standing in the doorway with his back turned to us. I clenched my fist and shook it at Stebelkov.","This was all true. Darya Onisimovna was the mother of poor Olya, whose story I have told already.

In words one could speak and hint about anything; but to make up your mind, to proceed, and in fact to fulfill it - no, this, I will tell you, is character!","Now the reader will understand that, although I was to some extent forewarned, I still couldn't possibly have guessed that in a day or two I would find the old prince in my apartment and, what's more, under extremely shocking circumstances. How could I ever have imagined such audacity on Anna's part? For while anyone can talk about and think up all sorts of plans, carrying them out is quite a different matter. No, I must say, Anna really had character!","The reader will understand now that though I was to some extent forewarned, yet I could not have guessed that the next day, or the day after, I should find the old prince in my lodgings and in such circumstances. Indeed, I never could have conceived of such audacity from Anna Andreyevna. One may talk freely and hint at anything one likes, but to decide, to act, and to carry things out— well, that really is character!"

"Затем не стану описывать всего этого утра, хотя и много бы можно было припомнить. Версилова в церкви на похоронах не было, да, кажется, по их виду, можно было еще до выноса заключить, что в церковь его и не ждали. Мама благоговейно молилась и, по-видимому, вся отдалась молитве. У гроба были только Татьяна Павловна и Лиза. Но ничего, ничего не описываю. После погребения все воротились и сели за стол, и опять-таки по виду их я заключил, что и к столу его, вероятно, не ждали. Когда встали из-за стола, я подошел к маме, горячо обнял ее и поздравил с днем ее рождения; за мной сделала то же самое Лиза.","Then I will not describe the whole of this morning, although much could be remembered. Versilov was not in the church at the funeral, and, it seems, by their appearance, it was possible to conclude even before the removal that he was not expected to go to the church. Mom prayed reverently and, apparently, gave herself up to prayer. Only Tatyana Pavlovna and Lisa were at the coffin. But I am not describing anything. After the burial, everyone came back and sat down at the table, and again, from their appearance, I concluded that they probably did not expect him to the table either. When they got up from the table, I went up to my mother, hugged her warmly and congratulated her on her birthday; Lisa did the same for me.","I won't describe everything that happened in the course of that morning, although much of it was notable. Versilov never showed up at the church for the funeral and, judging from their faces, they didn't seem to expect him. Mother prayed with ardent devotion and seemed to be completely absorbed in her prayers. Only Lisa and Mrs. Prutkov stood by the coffin. But, again, I refuse to go into details. Then, after the funeral when we all came back and sat down at the table, once more I felt that they didn't expect him to come. When we got up, I went over to Mother, put my arm around her, and kissed her warmly, wishing her a happy birthday. Lisa did the same.","I won't describe the rest of that morning, though there is a great deal that might be recalled. Versilov was not at the funeral service in the church, and I fancy from their faces I could have gathered that they did not expect him there. Mother prayed devoutly and seemed entirely absorbed in the service; there were only Liza and Tatyana Pavlovna by the coffin. But I will describe nothing, nothing. After the burial we all returned and sat down to a meal, and again I gathered by their faces that he was not expected to it. When we rose from the table, I went up to mother, embraced her and congratulated her on her birthday; Liza did the same after me."
"С неудержимым отвращением и с неудержимым намерением все загладить я вдруг вскочил с дивана; но только что я вскочил, мигом выскочила Альфонсинка. Я схватил шубу и шапку и велел ей передать Ламберту, что я вчера бредил, что я оклеветал женщину, что я нарочно шутил и чтоб Ламберт не смел больше никогда приходить ко мне… Все это я высказал кое-как, через пень колоду, торопясь, по-французски, и, разумеется, страшно неясно, но, к удивлению моему, Альфонсинка все поняла ужасно; но что всего удивительнее, даже чему-то как бы обрадовалась.","With irrepressible disgust and with an irresistible intention to make amends for everything, I suddenly jumped up from the sofa; but as soon as I jumped up, Alfonsinka immediately jumped out. I grabbed my fur coat and hat and told her to tell Lambert that I was delirious yesterday, that I had slandered a woman, that I was joking on purpose and that Lambert should never dare to come to me again ... in French, and, of course, terribly obscure, but, to my surprise, Alfonsinka understood everything terribly; but what was most surprising of all, she even seemed to rejoice at something.","Overwhelmed by disgust, I jumped up from the sofa. I had an irresistible urge to make up for what I'd done. But the second I was on my feet, Alphonsine skipped out from behind her screen. I grabbed my coat and hat and told her to tell Lambert that what I'd said last night was all nonsense, that I was raving, that I'd slandered an honest woman, that I was just joking, and that Lambert, if he knew what was good for him, had better stay away from me. ... All this I told her disjointedly, in a hurry, in French, certainly not too intelligibly. But, to my surprise, Alphonsine understood everything perfectly and— what really astounded me—appeared rather pleased.","With an overpowering sense of disgust, and a firm determination to cancel all that had happened, I suddenly jumped up from the sofa; but as I jumped up, Alphonsine instantly popped out. I seized my overcoat and cap and told her to tell Lambert that I had been raving the evening before, that I had slandered a woman, that I had been joking, and that Lambert must not dare come near me again… . All this I expressed in a blundering fashion, talking hurriedly in French, and, of course, anything but clearly, but, to my surprise, Alphonsine understood everything perfectly; and what was most surprising of all, she seemed positively relieved at something."
"Ну, а я-то что же? Знал ли я что-нибудь и что я знал ко дню выхода? Начиная это entrefilet, я уведомил, что ничего не знал ко дню выхода, что узнал обо всем слишком позже и даже тогда, когда уже все совершилось. Это правда, но так ли вполне? Нет, не так; я уже знал кое-что несомненно, знал даже слишком много, но как? Пусть читатель вспомнит про сон! Если уж мог быть такой сон, если уж мог он вырваться из моего сердца и так формулироваться, то, значит, я страшно много – не знал, а предчувствовал из того самого, что сейчас разъяснил и что в самом деле узнал лишь тогда, «когда уже все кончилось». Знания не было, но сердце билось от предчувствий, и злые духи уже овладели моими снами. И вот к этакому человеку я рвался, вполне зная, что это за человек, и предчувствуя даже подробности! И зачем я рвался? Представьте: мне теперь, вот в эту самую минуту, как я пишу, кажется, что я уже тогда знал во всех подробностях, зачем я рвался к нему, тогда как, опять-таки, я еще ничего не знал. Может быть, читатель это поймет. А теперь – к делу, и факт за фактом.","Well, what about me? Did I know anything and what did I know by release day? Starting this entrefilet, I announced that I did not know anything by the day of the release, that I found out about everything too late and even when everything was already done. This is true, but is it true? No not like this; I already knew something undoubtedly, I even knew too much, but how? Let the reader remember the dream! If there could be such a dream, if it could break out of my heart and be formulated in this way, then it means that I didn’t know an awful lot, but had a presentiment from the very one that I just explained and that I actually learned only when, “when it's all over already."" There was no knowledge, but my heart was beating with premonitions, and evil spirits had already taken possession of my dreams. And so I rushed to such a person, fully knowing what kind of person he was, and even anticipating the details! And why did I rush? Imagine: now, at this very moment, as I write, it seems to me that I already knew in all the details why I was rushing to him, while, again, I still knew nothing. Perhaps the reader will understand this. And now - to the point, and fact by fact.","And what about me? Did I know? That is, what exactly did I know the day I was allowed to leave the house? When I started out on this last explanation which I tried to present in the form of a newspaper account, I said that I wasn't aware of anything when I stepped out of the house, that I was to find out about it all much too late, in fact only when it was all over. Well, that's not quite true, because I certainly knew that something was in the air and I knew it only too well. But how could I possibly have known already then? Well, remember the dream I mentioned. The fact that I could have had such a dream, the fact that it could have gushed out of my mind formulated as it was, indicated that I was aware of lots of things—not that I actually knew about them, but that I had a presentiment of much of what was afoot that I have explained here. But in actual fact, as I said, I knew nothing until everything was over. I had no knowledge, but a premonition made my heart throb and allowed evil spirits to take possession of my dreams. Nevertheless, it was to Lambert that I rushed off, fully knowing what sort of man he was and with a presentiment of what was going to happen, even down to the smallest detail! So why did I rush to him then? Now, can you imagine that, as I'm writing this, I have the impression that even then I knew exactly why I was rushing to him, although in fact I still knew nothing? I hope the reader will understand this. And now I shall get back to my story and relate fact after fact, in proper order.","Well, and what of me? Did I know anything, and what did I know on the day I went out? When I began this entrefilet I declared that I knew nothing on that day, but found out about everything much later, and only when it was all over. That's the truth, but is it the full truth? No, it is not; I certainly knew something already, I knew a great deal, indeed. But how? Let the reader remember my DREAM! If I could have had such a dream, if it could have surged up from my heart and taken that shape, I must have had, not a knowledge but a presentiment of a very great deal of what I have just explained, though in actual fact I only discovered it when everything was over. I had no knowledge of it, but my heart was throbbing with forebodings, and evil spirits had possession of my dreams. And it was to that man that I rushed, fully knowing what sort of man he was and foreseeing everything even in detail. And why did I rush to him? Imagine; it seems to me now at the very minute when I am writing that I knew exactly at the time why I was rushing to him, though, again, I knew nothing then. Perhaps the reader will understand this. Now to get on with my story, fact by fact."

"После девятидневного беспамятства я очнулся тогда возрожденный, но не исправленный; возрождение мое было, впрочем, глупое, разумеется если брать в обширном смысле, и, может быть, если б это теперь, то было бы не так. Идея, то есть чувство, состояла опять лишь в том (как и тысячу раз прежде), чтоб уйти от них совсем, но уже непременно уйти, а не так, как прежде, когда я тысячу раз задавал себе эту же тему и все не мог исполнить. Мстить я не хотел никому, и даю в том честное слово, – хотя был всеми обижен. Уходить я собирался без отвращения, без проклятий, но я хотел собственной силы, и уже настоящей, не зависимой ни от кого из них и в целом мире; а я-то уже чуть было не примирился со всем на свете! Записываю эту тогдашнюю грезу мою не как мысль, а как неотразимое тогдашнее ощущение. Я его еще не хотел формулировать, пока был в постели. Больной и без сил, лежа в версиловской комнате, которую они отвели для меня, я с болью сознавал, на какой низкой степени бессилия я находился: валялась на постели какая-то соломинка, а не человек, и не по болезни только, – и как мне это было обидно! И вот из самой глубины существа моего из всех сил стал подыматься протест, и я задыхался от какого-то чувства бесконечно преувеличенной надменности и вызова. Я не помню даже времени в целой жизни моей, когда бы я был полон более надменных ощущений, как в те первые дни моего выздоровления, то есть когда валялась соломинка на постели.","After nine days of unconsciousness, I woke up then reborn, but not corrected; My revival was, however, stupid, of course, if taken in a broad sense, and, perhaps, if it were now, it would not be so. The idea, that is, the feeling, again consisted only in this (as it had been a thousand times before) in order to get away from them completely, but already by all means to leave, and not in the same way as before, when I asked myself the same theme a thousand times and still could not execute. I did not want to take revenge on anyone, and I give my word of honor in that, although I was offended by everyone. I was going to leave without disgust, without cursing, but I wanted my own strength, and already real, not dependent on any of them and in the whole world; and I was already almost reconciled with everything in the world! I write down this dream of mine at that time not as a thought, but as an irresistible feeling of that time. I didn't want to formulate it yet while I was in bed. Sick and exhausted, lying in the Versilov room they had reserved for me, I was painfully aware of what a low degree of impotence I was in: some kind of straw was lying on the bed, and not a person, and not only due to illness - and how I was embarrassed! And now, from the very depths of my being, a protest began to rise with all my might, and I was suffocating from some feeling of infinitely exaggerated arrogance and defiance. I don't even remember a time in my whole life when I was filled with more arrogant sensations than in those first days of my convalescence, that is, when a straw lay on my bed.","After spending nine days totally unconscious, I came back to myself quite regenerated but not at all reformed. Actually my regeneration was pretty stupid if considered in a broader sense, and perhaps if it had happened to me now, it would have been quite different. My guiding idea, or rather my feelings, simply amounted to leaving them once and for all (just as I had resolved a thousand times before), but this time I was determined really to do it. I didn't have any desire to punish anyone—I give you my word of honor I didn't—although I might have had a legitimate grudge against all of them. I wanted to leave without anger or harsh words; I felt that I needed to build my own personal strength, a strength that would be dependent on none of them and on no one in the entire world but me! I'm noting the longing I had then, which was an overwhelming feeling rather than a clearly formulated thought. Somehow as long as I was still confined to my bed, I was reluctant to put it into words. Sick and feeble, I lay in Ver-silov's room where they'd put me and was acutely aware of the extent of my helplessness: I lay there more like a piece of straw than a man and the reason for my impotence was not merely my poor physical state . . . And that's what enraged me most! So, from the deepest recesses of my being, a feeling of protest started rising and gaining strength and I began to suffocate from concentrated arrogance and defiance. In fact, I can't think of any period of my life when I was more bloated by arrogance than in those days of my convalescence when I lay like a piece of straw tossed on that bed.","After nine days' unconsciousness I came to myself, regenerated but not reformed; my regeneration was a stupid one, however, of course, if the word is taken in the wide sense, and perhaps if it had happened now it would have been different. The idea, or rather the feeling, that possessed me was, as it had been a thousand times before, the desire to get away altogether, but this time I meant to go away, not as in the past, when I had so often considered the project and been incapable of carrying it out. I didn't want to revenge myself on anyone, and I give my word of honour that I did not, though I had been insulted by all of them. I meant to go away without loathing, without cursing, and never to return, but I wanted to do this by my own effort, and by real effort unassisted by any one of them, or by anyone in the whole world; yet I was almost on the point of being reconciled with every one! I record this absorbing dream not as a thought, but as an overwhelming sensation. I did not care to formulate it as long as I was in bed. Sick and helpless I lay in Versilov's room, which they had given up to me; I recognized, with a pang, how abjectly helpless I was. What was tossing on the bed was not a man but a feeble straw, and this impotence was not only through illness—and how degrading I felt it! And so from the very depth of my being, from all the forces in me, a protest began to rise, and I was choking with a feeling of infinitely exaggerated pride and defiance. Indeed, I can't remember any time in my whole life when I was so full of arrogant feeling as I was during the early days of my convalescence, that is, while I was tossing like a weak straw on my bed."

"Чем далеко ходить, прибегну к вашей же рукописи. Взгляните, например, на оба семейства господина Версилова (на сей раз позвольте уж мне быть вполне откровенным). Во-первых, про самого Андрея Петровича я не распространяюсь; но, однако, он – все же из родоначальников. Это – дворянин древнейшего рода и в то же время парижский коммунар. Он истинный поэт и любит Россию, но зато и отрицает ее вполне. Он без всякой религии, но готов почти умереть за что-то неопределенное, чего и назвать не умеет, но во что страстно верует, по примеру множества русских европейских цивилизаторов петербургского периода русской истории. Но довольно о нем самом; вот, однако же, его родовое семейство: про сына его и говорить не стану, да и не стоит он этой чести. Те, у кого есть глаза, знают заранее, до чего дойдут у нас подобные сорванцы, а кстати и других доведут. Но вот его дочь, Анна Андреевна, – и чем же не с характером девица? Лицо в размерах матушки игуменьи Митрофании – разумеется, не предрекая ничего уголовного, что было бы уже несправедливым с моей стороны. Скажите мне теперь, Аркадий Макарович, что семейство это – явление случайное, и я возрадуюсь духом. Но, напротив, не будет ли справедливее вывод, что уже множество таких, несомненно родовых, семейств русских с неудержимою силою переходят массами в семейства случайные и сливаются с ними в общем беспорядке и хаосе. Тип этого случайного семейства указываете отчасти и вы в вашей рукописи. Да, Аркадий Макарович, вы – член случайного семейства, в противоположность еще недавним родовым нашим типам, имевшим столь различные от ваших детство и отрочество.","The farther I go, I will resort to your own manuscript. Take a look, for example, at both families of Mr. Versilov (this time let me be quite frank). Firstly, I do not expand on Andrei Petrovich himself; but, nevertheless, he is still one of the ancestors. This is a nobleman of the most ancient family and at the same time a Parisian Communard. He is a true poet and loves Russia, but on the other hand he completely denies it. He is without any religion, but he is almost ready to die for something indefinite, which he does not know how to name, but which he passionately believes in, following the example of many Russian European civilizers of the St. Petersburg period of Russian history. But enough about him; here, however, is his ancestral family: I won’t even talk about his son, and he’s not worth this honor. Those who have eyes know in advance what such tomboys will come to in our country, and by the way, they will bring others. But here is his daughter, Anna Andreevna - and why not a girl with character? The face is the size of Mother Superior Mitrofania - of course, without predicting anything criminal, which would already be unfair on my part. Tell me now, Arkady Makarovich, that this family is an accidental phenomenon, and I will rejoice in spirit. But, on the contrary, wouldn’t it be more just to conclude that already a multitude of such, undoubtedly generic, families of Russians with irresistible force are passing en masse into random families and merging with them in a general disorder and chaos. The type of this random family is partly indicated by you in your manuscript. Yes, Arkady Makarovich, you are a member of a random family, in contrast to our more recent tribal types, who had childhood and adolescence so different from yours.","""Instead of looking for an illustration far afield, let me take your own Notes. I'll take the liberty of being completely frank and suggest that you look at Mr. Versilov's two families. I don't wish to enlarge too much on Mr. Versilov himself, but, after all, he is a member of the Russian landed gentry and comes from an old, distinguished family. At the same time, however, he is a champion of the Paris Commune. He is a true poet, he loves Russia, yet he also denigrates her; he has no religion and yet would be willing to die for something vague that he is unable even to name but in which he believes ardently, as do so many Russian proponents of European civilization of the Petersburg period of our history. But enough about him personally. Let us turn to his legitimate family. His son is not even worth mentioning—it would be doing him too much honor: anyone who has eyes to see knows how this sort of irresponsible fool will end up, dragging others to perdition along with him. But his daughter—if anyone has a strong character, it is Anna! She has a personality of the proportions of the Abbess Mitrofania,[23] although I'm not suggesting that she may end up as a criminal—that would be quite uncalled for on my part. ""Now, if you could convince me, Arkady, that this family is an exception, an accident, I would be very relieved. But wouldn't it be much more accurate to conclude that many such legitimate Russian families are broken up and become accidental groupings, all merging into the general disorder and chaos. In your manuscript there emerges a type of such an accidental family and you, Arkady, are a member of that family; this is already a departure from the typical recent literary character who came from a regular, traditional background and had a childhood and adolescence quite different from yours.","""I will not pursue this further, but will hasten back to your manuscript. Consider, for instance, both the families of M. Versilov (for this once I will venture to be quite open). I won't enlarge on Andrey Petrovitch himself; but he is anyway of a good old family. He is a nobleman of ancient lineage, and at the same time a Parisian communard. He is a true poet and loves Russia, yet denies her absolutely. He is without any sort of religion, but yet almost ready to die for something indefinite, to which he cannot give a name, but in which he fervently believes, like a number of Russian adherents of European civilisation of the Petersburg period of Russian history. But enough of him. As for his legitimate family, I won't discuss his son, and indeed, he is not worthy of the honour. All who have eyes know what upstarts like that come to in Russia, and what they bring others to as well. Then his daughter, Anna Andreyevna—she is surely a girl of strong character? A figure on the scale of the Mother Abbess Mitrofania, not that I mean to predict anything criminal—which would be unjust on my part. ""If you can assure me, Arkady Makarovitch, that that family is an exceptional phenomenon it will rejoice my heart. But would it not be on the contrary a truer conclusion, that a multitude of unquestionably aristocratic Russian families are with irresistible force passing in masses into exceptional families and mingling with them in the general lawlessness and chaos. A typical example of such an exceptional family is sketched by you in your manuscript. Yes, Arkady Makarovitch, you are A MEMBER OF AN EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY, in contrary distinction to the aristocratic types who have had such a very different childhood and adolescence from yours."
"Он рассеянно улыбнулся и, странно, прямо пошел в переднюю, точно выводя меня сам, разумеется не замечая, что делает.","He smiled absently and, strangely, walked straight into the hall, as if leading me out himself, of course not noticing what he was doing.","He smiled absentmindedly and suddenly started walking toward the front door, as though to show me out, although obviously he was not aware of what he was doing.","He gave me an absent-minded smile and, strange to say, walked straight into the passage as though to show me out, probably not noticing what he was doing."
"Главнейшее состояло в том, что существует документ, и что обладатель его – я, и что этот документ имеет высокую ценность: в этом Ламберт не сомневался. Здесь опускаю одно обстоятельство, о котором лучше будет сказать впоследствии и в своем месте, но упомяну лишь о том, что обстоятельство это наиглавнейше утвердило Ламберта в убеждении о действительном существовании и, главное, о ценности документа. (Обстоятельство роковое, предупреждаю вперед, которого я-то уж никак вообразить не мог не только тогда, но даже до самого конца всей истории, когда все вдруг рушилось и разъяснилось само собой.) Итак, убежденный в главном, он, первым шагом, поехал к Анне Андреевне.","The main thing was that the document existed, and that I was the owner of it, and that this document was of high value: Lambert did not doubt this. Here I omit one circumstance, which it will be better to mention later and in its place, but I will only mention that this circumstance most importantly confirmed Lambert in his conviction of the actual existence and, most importantly, of the value of the document. (A fatal circumstance, I warn you in advance, which I could not have imagined, not only then, but even until the very end of the whole story, when everything suddenly collapsed and clarified itself.) And so, convinced of the main thing, he, with the first step, set off to Anna Andreevna.","The three facts that interested him especially were: that the document existed, that it was in my possession, and that it was worth a great deal of money. On that score, Lumbert had no doubts. I'll explain later, in the proper place, what actually convinced Lambert of the existence and, above all, of the value of the document. I may say right now, though, that he had stumbled on that information by sheer chance, which I never suspected until the final catastrophe when everything burst wide open. But, in any case, as soon as he had found out the essentials, he went to see Anna.","The most important fact was the existence of the DOCUMENT, and that I was in possession of it, and that that document was of the highest value—of that Lambert had no doubt. Here I omit one circumstance, which will come in better later, in its proper place, and will only mention here that that circumstance was what principally confirmed Lambert in the conviction of the real existence and, still more, of the value of the document. It was, I may say beforehand, a momentous circumstance, of which I could have no conception either at the time or afterwards, until the final catastrophe, when everything was discovered and became evident of itself. And so, convinced of the main facts, his first step was to go to Anna Andreyevna."
"– Однако… однако как вы засуетились? – проговорил он тихо, обводя нас всех пристальным взглядом. Затем вдруг положил оба локтя на стол и подпер голову руками:","“However… however, how did you fuss?” he said softly, gazing at us all with a fixed gaze. Then he suddenly put both elbows on the table and propped his head on his hands:","but you really got worried. Why?"" he said quietly, and looked searchingly at every one of us in turn.

"Версилов был не один. Объясню заранее: отослав вчера такое письмо к Катерине Николаевне и действительно (один только Бог знает зачем) послав копию с него барону Бьорингу, он, естественно, сегодня же, в течение дня, должен был ожидать и известных «последствий» своего поступка, а потому и принял своего рода меры: с утра еще он перевел маму и Лизу (которая, как я узнал потом, воротившись еще утром, расхворалась и лежала в постели) наверх, «в гроб», а комнаты, и особенно наша «гостиная», были усиленно прибраны и выметены. И действительно, в два часа пополудни пожаловал к нему один барон Р., полковник, военный, господин лет сорока, немецкого происхождения, высокий, сухой и с виду очень сильный физически человек, тоже рыжеватый, как и Бьоринг, и немного только плешивый. Это был один из тех баронов Р., которых очень много в русской военной службе, все людей с сильнейшим баронским гонором, совершенно без состояния, живущих одним жалованьем и чрезвычайных служак и фрунтовиков. Я не застал начала их объяснения; оба были очень оживлены, да и как не быть. Версилов сидел на диване перед столом, а барон в креслах сбоку. Версилов был бледен, но говорил сдержанно и цедя слова, барон же возвышал голос и видимо наклонен был к порывистым жестам, сдерживался через силу, но смотрел строго, высокомерно и даже презрительно, хотя и не без некоторого удивления. Завидев меня, он нахмурился, но Версилов почти мне обрадовался:","Versilov was not alone. Let me explain in advance: having sent such a letter yesterday to Katerina Nikolaevna and indeed (only God knows why) sent a copy from it to Baron Bjoring, naturally, today, during the day, he should have expected certain “consequences” of his act, and therefore and took some kind of measures: in the morning he transferred mother and Lisa (who, as I found out later, having returned in the morning, had fallen ill and was lying in bed) upstairs, “to the coffin”, and the rooms, and especially our “living room”, were heavily tidy and swept. And indeed, at two o'clock in the afternoon, one baron R., a colonel, a military man, a gentleman of about forty, of German origin, came to see him, a tall, dry and apparently very strong physically man, also reddish, like Björing, and only a little bald. This was one of those barons R., of whom there are a lot in the Russian military service, all people with the strongest baronial ambition, completely without a fortune, living on one salary and extraordinary servicemen and soldiers. I did not find the beginning of their explanation; both were very lively, and how not to be. Versilov was sitting on the sofa in front of the table, and the baron was in an armchair to the side. Versilov was pale, but spoke with restraint and stammered out his words, while the baron raised his voice and was apparently inclined towards impetuous gestures, restraining himself through force, but looking sternly, arrogantly and even contemptuously, although not without some surprise. Seeing me, he frowned, but Versilov was almost glad to see me:","Versilov wasn't alone. At this point I must anticipate my story and explain the position he was in. After he'd sent the letter to Katerina and a copy, just as he'd said (God knows why), to Bjoring, he naturally expected that what he had done would have certain consequences and had prepared for them. The first thing he'd done that morning was to move Mother and Lisa (who, I learned later, had been ill since she'd returned home and had to stay in bed) into my former coffin-like attic, while the rest of the place, especially the living room, had been cleaned and tidied up with special care. And, just as he'd expected, at two o'clock in the afternoon he received a visit from a certain Baron R, a forty-year-old colonel, one of those German barons of whom there are so many in the Russian service, who are full of their baronial arrogance though penniless, who have to live on their pay and are the most zealous sticklers for rules and regulations. He was a tall, lean, and powerful-looking man and his hair had the same reddish tinge as Bjoring's, although this baron's hair was already getting thin on top. Since I arrived after Baron R. I missed the beginning of their conversation and now they both seemed rather excited, as well they might. Versilov sat at the table and the baron occupied an armchair next to it. Versilov was pale and spoke with restraint, as though pouring his words through a funnel. The baron, on the other hand, kept raising his voice and was obviously a man who could lose his temper without much provocation. Now he was making a visible effort to control himself, still looking supercilious and even contemptuous, albeit rather surprised. When he saw me he frowned, while Versilov seemed rather pleased at my unexpected intrusion.","Versilov was not alone. To explain the position beforehand: after sending that letter to Katerina Nikolaevna the day before and actually dispatching a copy of it to Baron Büring (God only knows why), naturally he was bound to expect certain ""consequences"" of his action in the course of to-day, and so had taken measures of a sort. He had in the morning moved my mother upstairs to my ""coffin,"" together with Liza, who, as I learned afterwards, had been taken ill when she got home, and had gone to bed. The other rooms, especially the drawing-room, had been scrubbed and tidied up with extra care. And at two o'clock in the afternoon a certain Baron R. did in fact make his appearance. He was a colonel, a tall thin gentleman about forty, a little bald, of German origin, with ginger-coloured hair like Büring's, and a look of great physical strength. He was one of those Baron R.s of whom there are so many in the Russian army, all men of the highest baronial dignity, entirely without means, living on their pay, and all zealous and conscientious officers. I did not come in time for the beginning of their interview; both were very much excited, and they might well be. Versilov was sitting on the sofa facing the table, and the baron was in an armchair on one side. Versilov was pale, but he spoke with restraint, dropping out his words one by one; the baron raised his voice and was evidently given to violent gesticulation. He restrained himself with an effort, but he looked stern, supercilious, and even contemptuous, though somewhat astonished. Seeing me he frowned, but Versilov seemed almost relieved at my coming."

"– Попробуйте этого, – сказал он, протягивая мне бутылку. Тут я вдруг догадался, что и ему должно уже быть известно обо мне все на свете – и история моя, и имя мое, и, может быть, то, в чем рассчитывал на меня Ламберт. Мысль, что он примет меня за служащего у Ламберта, взбесила меня опять, а в лице Ламберта выразилось сильнейшее и глупейшее беспокойство, чуть только тот заговорил со мной. Рябой это заметил и засмеялся. «Решительно Ламберт от всех зависит», – подумал я, ненавидя его в ту минуту от всей души. Таким образом, мы хотя и просидели весь обед за одним столом, но были разделены на две группы: рябой с Ламбертом, ближе к окну, один против другого, и я рядом с засаленным Андреевым, а напротив меня – Тришатов. Ламберт спешил с кушаньями, поминутно торопя слугу подавать. Когда подали шампанское, он вдруг протянул ко мне свой бокал.","“Try this one,” he said, handing me the bottle. Then I suddenly realized that he must already know everything about me in the world - both my history, and my name, and, perhaps, what Lambert counted on me for. The thought that he would take me for an employee of Lambert infuriated me again, and Lambert's face expressed the strongest and most stupid anxiety, as soon as he spoke to me. The pock-marked one noticed this and laughed. “Lambert definitely depends on everyone,” I thought, hating him at that moment with all my heart. Thus, although we spent the entire dinner at the same table, we were divided into two groups: pockmarked with Lambert, closer to the window, one against the other, and I next to the greasy Andreev, and opposite me is Trishatov. Lambert was in a hurry with the food, every minute rushing the servant to serve. When champagne was served, he suddenly held out his glass to me.","""Why don't you try this instead?"" I suddenly realized that he must have known everything there was to know about me—my name, my life story, and probably what Lambert wanted from me. The thought that he might take me for one of Lambert's flunkeys made me furious. I also noticed a stupidly worried expression on Lambert's face the moment the man spoke to me. The pockmarked one must have noticed it too and it made him laugh. "" Ah, Lambert cringes before everybody,"" I thought and at that moment I really hated him. And so, although we were all dining at the same table, it was as if we were split into two groups: on the side closer to the window, Lambert and the pockmarked man facing each other; and on the other side, myself, next to the grubby Andreyev, facing the young Trishatov. Lambert seemed to be anxious to get on with the dinner and kept urging the waiters to hurry. When the champagne was served, he held out his glass to me:","""Try this,"" he said, offering me the bottle. I guessed, on the spot, that he too, knew everything in the world about me—my story, and my name, and perhaps the fact that Lambert was counting upon me. The idea that he was taking me for a satellite maddened me again, and Lambert's face betrayed an intense and very stupid uneasiness when the pock-marked man addressed me; the latter noticed it and laughed. ""There's no doubt that Lambert depends on all of them,"" I thought, hating him at that instant with my whole soul. In this way, though we were sitting at the same table, throughout the whole dinner we were divided into two groups; the pock-marked man with Lambert, facing each other close to the window, while I was beside the grubby Andreyev, and Trishatov sat facing me. Lambert hurried on the dinner, continually urging the waiters to make haste with the dishes. When the champagne was brought he held out his glass to me:"

"Я, разумеется, не надеялся выиграть пари: было тридцать шесть шансов против одного, что zero не выйдет; но я предложил, во-первых, потому, что форсил, а во-вторых, потому, что хотелось чем-то всех привлечь к себе. Я слишком видел, что меня никто здесь почему-то не любит и что мне с особенным удовольствием дают это знать. Рулетка завертелась – и каково же было всеобщее изумление, когда вдруг вышло опять zero! Даже всеобщий крик раздался. Тут слава выигрыша совершенно меня отуманила. Мне опять отсчитали сто сорок полуимпериалов. Зерщиков спросил меня, не хочу ли я получить часть кредитками, но я что-то промычал ему, потому что буквально уже не мог спокойно и обстоятельно изъясняться. Голова у меня кружилась и ноги слабели. Я вдруг почувствовал, что страшно сейчас пойду рисковать; кроме того, мне хотелось еще что-нибудь предпринять, предложить еще какое-нибудь пари, отсчитать кому-нибудь несколько тысяч. Машинально сгребал я ладонью мою кучку кредиток и золотых и не мог собраться их сосчитать. В эту минуту я вдруг заметил сзади меня князя и Дарзана: они только что вернулись с своего банка, и как узнал я после, проигравшись там в пух.","I certainly didn't expect to win the bet: there were thirty-six to one chances that zero wouldn't come out; but I suggested, firstly, because I forced myself, and secondly, because I wanted to somehow attract everyone to me. I saw too well that for some reason no one here loves me, and that they let me know with particular pleasure. The roulette wheel started spinning - and what was the general amazement when suddenly zero came out again! There was even a general scream. Here the glory of winning completely bewildered me. I was again counted one hundred and forty semi-imperials. Zershchikov asked me if I would like to receive part of the credit cards, but I mumbled something to him, because I literally could no longer speak calmly and in detail. My head was spinning and my legs were weak. I suddenly felt that it was terrifying now to take risks; besides, I wanted to do something else, offer some more bet, count off someone a few thousand. Mechanically, I raked my handful of banknotes and gold with my palm and could not bring myself to count them. At that moment, I suddenly noticed the prince and Darzan behind me: they had just returned from their bank, and as I found out later, having lost there in the fluff.","Obviously I didn't expect to win the bet: the chances were thirty-six to one that the zero was not going to come up. The only reason I offered him that bet was because I felt like showing off and also because I wanted everybody to pay attention to me. I saw only too clearly that, for whatever reason, they didn't like me around here and were only too pleased to let me know it. The roulette wheel spun. And, to the general amazement, it again came to a halt on the zero. Many voices shouted at the same time! And now success completely befogged my sight. Again, one hundred and forty half-imperials were counted out to me. Zershikov asked me whether it would be all right if I was paid partly in bills, but I could only mumble something inarticulate in reply for I had lost the ability to express myself intelligibly. My head was spinning and my legs felt weak. I felt that I was about to take crazy risks. Moreover, I was longing to do something unusual, to make another bet on the side, to count out a few thousands to someone or other. . . . Without having the sense to count them, I scooped up my bills and gold into the palms of my hands. And it was at thatl moment that I noticed Sergei and Darzan: they stood behind me. They'd just come in from their faro room where, as I learned later, they'd lost every last kopek they had on them.","I did not of course hope to win the bet; there were thirty-six chances against one that zero would not turn up again; but I proposed it out of swagger, and because I wanted to attract every one's attention.

The roulette wheel was sent spinning,—and what was the general amazement when it stopped at zero again! There was actually a general shout. The glory of my success dazed me completely. Again a hundred and forty half imperials were counted out to me. Zerstchikov asked me if I would not like to take part of them in notes, but I mumbled something inarticulate in reply, for I was literally incapable of expressing myself in a calm and definite way. My head was going round and my legs felt weak. I suddenly felt that I would take a fearful risk at once; moreover, I had a longing to do something more, to make another bet, to carry off some thousands from some one. Mechanically I scooped up my notes and gold in the hollow of my hand, and could not collect myself to count them. At that moment I noticed Prince Sergay and Darzan behind me: they had only just come from their faro saloon, where as I heard afterwards they had lost their last farthing."

Что говорил я тогда, я совсем не помню, и вряд ли складно хоть сколько-нибудь, вряд ли даже слова выговаривал ясно; но он очень слушал.

"«А было у нас в городе Афимьевском, скажу теперь, вот како чудо. Жил купец, Скотобойников прозывался, Максим Иванович, и не было его богаче по всей округе. Ситцевую фабрику построил и рабочих несколько сот содержал; и возмнил о себе безмерно. И надо так сказать, что уже все ходило по его знаку, и само начальство ни в чем не препятствовало, и архимандрит за ревность благодарил: много на монастырь жертвовал и, когда стих находил, очень о душе своей воздыхал и о будущем веке озабочен был немало. Вдов был и бездетен; про супругу-то его был слух, что усахарил он ее будто еще на первом году и что смолоду ручкам любил волю давать; только давно уж перед тем это было; снова же обязаться браком не захотел. Слаб был тоже и выпить, и, когда наступал ему срок, то хмельной по городу бежит нагишом и вопит; город не знатный, а все зазорно. Когда же переставал срок, становился сердит, и все, что он рассудит, то и хорошо, и все, что повелит, то и прекрасно. А народ рассчитывал произвольно; возьмет счеты, наденет очки: „Тебе, Фома, сколько?“ – „С Рождества не брал, Максим Иванович, тридцать девять рублев моих есть“. – „Ух сколько денег! Это много тебе; ты и весь таких денег не стоишь, совсем не к лицу тебе будет: десять рублей с костей долой, а двадцать девять получай“. И молчит человек; да и никто не смеет пикнуть, все молчат.","“But it was in our city of Afimevsky, I’ll say now, what a miracle. There lived a merchant, Skotoboynikov was nicknamed Maxim Ivanovich, and he was not richer throughout the district. He built a cotton factory and kept several hundred workers; and imagined himself immeasurably. And it must be said that everything was already going according to his sign, and the authorities themselves did not interfere in anything, and the archimandrite thanked for his jealousy: he donated a lot to the monastery and, when he found a verse, he sighed very much about his soul and was a lot worried about the future century . The widow was also childless; there was a rumor about his wife that he had sweetened her as if in her first year and that from a young age he liked to give free rein to her hands; only long before that it was; again, he did not want to commit himself to marriage. He was also weak to drink, and when his time came, the intoxicated one runs naked through the city and screams; the city is not noble, but everything is shameful. When the term ceased, he became angry, and everything that he judges is good, and everything that he commands is fine. And the people calculated arbitrarily; he takes the abacus, puts on glasses: “How much do you want, Foma?” - “I haven’t taken it since Christmas, Maxim Ivanovich, I have thirty-nine rubles.” “Wow, how much money! That's a lot for you; you and all that kind of money are not worth it, it will not suit you at all: ten rubles off the bones, and get twenty-nine. And the man is silent; and no one dares to utter a word, everyone is silent.","It happened in our town, Afimievsk, and I'll tell you right off it was just like a miracle. A merchant lived there by the name of Maxim Skotoboinikov and there was no one richer than him in the whole district. He'd built himself a cotton mill and had several hundred hands working for him, and his importance went to his head. Everyone was at his beck and call: the authorities never interfered with him; the archimandrite praised him for his religious zeal, for he gave generously to the monastery. Still, at certain quiet moments, he'd think about his soul, sigh, and worry a great deal about life beyond the grave. He was a widower and childless. There was a rumor that he had done his wife in during the very first years of their marriage, because since his youth he hadn't bothered to keep his hands under control. But whatever had happened had taken place long ago and since then he'd never wanted to accept the bonds of another marriage. He also had a weakness for the bottle and during his drinking bouts he would rush outside stark naked and dash all over town hollering. And, although it was not much of a town to speak of, this was still a disgrace. Then, when he sobered up, he'd be in a wicked mood and there would be no arguing with whatever he thought fit and whatever he decided fair. He'd pay his employees just what he decided they should get. He'd put on his glasses, look into his books, and ask a man: ""How much would you say, Foma, is coming to you?"" ""Thirty-nine rubles, sir; I haven't drawn nothing since Christmas."" ""That's a lot of money, man; you're not worth that much altogether. That won't look right, you know. I'll take off ten rubles. So you can have twenty-nine."" And the poor fellow said nothing: no one dared argue with him so they just kept their mouths shut.","I'll tell you now of a wonderful thing that happened in our town, Afimyevsk. There was a merchant living there, his name was Skotoboynikov, Maxim Ivanovitch, and there was no one richer than he in all the countryside. He built a cotton factory, and he kept some hundreds of hands, and he exalted himself exceedingly. And everything, one may say, was at his beck and call, and even those in authority hindered him in nothing, and the archimandrite thanked him for his zeal: he gave freely of his substance to the monastery, and when the fit came upon him he sighed and groaned over his soul and was troubled not a little over the life to come. A widower he was and childless; of his wife there were tales that he had beaten her from the first year of their marriage, and that from his youth up he had been apt to be too free with his hands. Only all that had happened long ago; he had no desire to enter into the bonds of another marriage. He had a weakness for strong drink, too, and when the time came he would run drunk about the town, naked and shouting; the town was of little account and was full of iniquity. And when the time was ended he was moved to anger, and all that he thought fit was good, and all he bade them do was right. He paid his people according to his pleasure, he brings out his reckoning beads, puts on his spectacles: ""How much for you, Foma? "" ""I've had nothing since Christmas, Maxim Ivanovitch; thirty-nine roubles is my due."" ""Ough! what a sum of money! That's too much for you! It's more than you're worth altogether; it would not be fitting for you; ten roubles off the beads and you take twenty-nine. "" And the man says nothing; no one dares open his lips; all are dumb before him."

И, конечно, могли быть тотчас же найдены средства, чтоб вас… успокоить.

"Вне себя, я ответил каким-то весьма скверным ругательством, а затем… затем помню, что меня потащили в какую-то темную каморку «для вытрезвления». О, я не протестую. Вся публика прочла еще как-то недавно в газетах жалобу какого-то господина, просидевшего всю ночь под арестом, связанного, и тоже в комнате для вытрезвления, но тот, кажется, был даже и не виноват; я же был виновен. Я повалился на нары в сообществе каких-то двух бесчувственно спавших людей. У меня болела голова, стучало в висках, стучало сердце. Должно быть, я обеспамятел и, кажется, бредил. Помню только, что проснулся среди глубокой ночи и присел на нарах. Я разом припомнил все и все осмыслил и, положив локти в колени, руками подперев голову, погрузился в глубокое размышление.","Beside myself, I answered with some very nasty curse, and then ... then I remember that I was dragged into some kind of dark closet ""for sobering up."" Oh, I don't protest. Some time ago the whole public read in the newspapers the complaint of some gentleman who had spent the whole night under arrest, bound, and also in the sobering-up room, but he, it seems, was not even to blame; I was guilty. I collapsed on the bunk in the company of some two unconsciously sleeping people. My head ached, my temples were pounding, my heart was pounding. I must have lost my mind and seemed to be delirious. I only remember that I woke up in the middle of the night and sat down on the bunk. I remembered everything at once and comprehended everything, and, putting my elbows on my knees, propping my head on my hands, I plunged into deep thought.","That was really too much. Beside myself, I answered with an obscenity and they dragged me off into a dark cell ""until he sobers up. "" Oh, I'm not complaining because I know that recently the papers had carried a story about a complaint lodged against the police by a gentleman who had been kept all night handcuffed in such a cell, also ""until he sobered up,"" although he hadn't done anything at all, whereas I, at least, had done something. So I found myself lying on a sort of communal bunk on which already lay two unconscious bodies. My head ached, my temples throbbed, my heart was pounding. . . . Then I believe I lost consciousness and started raving. I remember waking up in the middle of the night, sitting up, and suddenly visualizing clearly all that had happened. I sat up and remained sitting for a long time, my elbows propped up on my knees and my head resting on the palms of my hands, immersed in thought.","Beside myself, I answered by a very coarse word of abuse, and then … then I remember they dragged me to a very dark little room, set apart for drunkards. Oh, I'm not complaining. Readers will have seen of late in the newspapers a complaint made by a gentleman who was kept all night under arrest, tied up, and in a room set apart for drunkards, but I believe he was quite innocent while I had done something. I threw myself on the common bed which I shared with two unconscious sleepers. My head ached, my temples throbbed, and so did my heart. I must have been unconscious, and I believe I was delirious. I only remember waking up in the middle of the night, and sitting on the bed. I remembered everything at once and understood it in all its bearings, and, with my elbow propped on my knees and my head in my hands, I sank into profound meditation."
"– О нет! – вскричал я, – и как ты страшен и в то же время глуп, Ламберт! Ну мог ли бы я, если б он любил ее, хотеть тут жениться? Ведь все-таки – сын и отец, это ведь уж стыдно будет. Он маму любит, маму, и я видел, как он обнимал ее, и я прежде сам думал, что он любит Катерину Николаевну, но теперь узнал ясно, что он, может, ее когда-то любил, но теперь давно ненавидит… и хочет мстить, и она боится, потому что я тебе скажу, Ламберт, он ужасно страшен, когда начнет мстить. Он почти сумасшедшим становится. Он когда на нее злится, то на все лезет. Это вражда в старом роде из-за возвышенных принципов. В наше время – наплевать на все общие принципы; в наше время не общие принципы, а одни только частные случаи. Ах, Ламберт, ты ничего не понимаешь: ты глуп, как палец; я говорю тебе теперь об этих принципах, а ты, верно, ничего не понимаешь. Ты ужасно необразован. Помнишь, ты меня бил? Я теперь сильнее тебя – знаешь ты это?","- Oh no! I cried, “and how terrible and at the same time stupid you are, Lambert! Well, could I, if he loved her, want to marry here? After all, after all, he is a son and a father, it would be a shame, after all. He loves his mother, mother, and I saw how he hugged her, and I myself used to think that he loved Katerina Nikolaevna, but now I have learned clearly that he may have once loved her, but now he hates her for a long time ... and wants to revenge, and she is afraid, because I tell you, Lambert, he is terribly scary when he starts to take revenge. He almost goes crazy. When he gets mad at her, he gets into everything. This is enmity of the old kind because of lofty principles. In our time - do not give a damn about all the general principles; in our time, not general principles, but only particular cases. Oh, Lambert, you don't understand anything: you're stupid as a finger; I'm telling you now about these principles, but you probably don't understand anything. You are terribly uneducated. Remember you beat me? I'm stronger than you now - do you know that?","""Oh no!"" I cried. ""You're really frightening, Lambert, and at the same time so incredibly stupid! How could I think of marrying her if I thought he loved her? After all, we are father and son, and it would be too disgusting for words. . . . Besides, he loves Mother, I saw how he embraced her. ... I too used to think that he was in love with Katerina, but now I'm certain that, even if he did love her once, he hates her now, and has hated her for a long time. He's planning to avenge himself on her and she's afraid of him because—let me tell you this, Lambert—he's really terrifying when he's out to destroy someone. He turns almost insane. When he hates a person, there's nothing that can stop him. Theirs is an old-style feud caused by disagreement on ideals. Nowadays people don't give a damn about general principles but are only concerned with their own particular cases. Ah, Lambert, you can't understand a thing; you have no more brains in your head than in your little toe. You're terribly primitive. Do you remember how you used to beat me up? Well, I'm stronger than you now, did you know that?""","""Oh no!"" I cried: ""and how horrid you are, and at the same time how stupid, Lambert! Why, if he were in love with her, how could I want to marry her? After all we are father and son, that would be shameful. He loves my mother, my mother, and I saw how he held her in his arms. I did think at one time he loved Katerina Nikolaevna, but now I know for certain that though he may once have loved her, he has hated her for a long time now … and wants to revenge himself on her, and she's afraid of him, for I tell you, Lambert, he is very terrible when he begins to revenge himself.

"Крафт об участи этого письма знал очень мало, но заметил, что Андроников «никогда не рвал нужных бумаг» и, кроме того, был человек хоть и широкого ума, но и «широкой совести». (Я даже подивился тогда такой чрезвычайной самостоятельности взгляда Крафта, столь любившего и уважавшего Андроникова.) Но Крафт имел все-таки уверенность, что компрометирующий документ будто бы попался в руки Версилова через близость того со вдовой и с дочерьми Андроникова; уже известно было, что они тотчас же и обязательно предоставили Версилову все бумаги, оставшиеся после покойного. Знал он тоже, что и Катерине Николавне уже известно, что письмо у Версилова и что она этого-то и боится, думая, что Версилов тотчас пойдет с письмом к старому князю; что, возвратясь из-за границы, она уже искала письмо в Петербурге, была у Андрониковых и теперь продолжает искать, так как все-таки у нее оставалась надежда, что письмо, может быть, не у Версилова, и, в заключение, что она и в Москву ездила единственно с этою же целью и умоляла там Марью Ивановну поискать в тех бумагах, которые сохранялись у ней. О существовании Марьи Ивановны и об ее отношениях к покойному Андроникову она проведала весьма недавно, уже возвратясь в Петербург.","Kraft knew very little about the fate of this letter, but he noted that Andronikov ""never tore up the necessary papers"" and, moreover, was a man of a broad mind, but also a ""broad conscience."" (I even marveled then at such extreme independence of Kraft's view, which loved and respected Andronikov so much.) But Kraft was still sure that the incriminating document had supposedly fallen into Versilov's hands through his closeness to Andronikov's widow and daughters; it was already known that they immediately and without fail gave Versilov all the papers left by the deceased. He also knew that Katerina Nikolaevna already knew that Versilov had the letter and that she was afraid of this, thinking that Versilov would immediately go with the letter to the old prince; that, having returned from abroad, she had already looked for the letter in St. Petersburg, had been with the Andronikovs, and now continues to look, since she still had the hope that the letter might not be with Versilov, and, in conclusion, that she and she went to Moscow solely for the same purpose and begged Marya Ivanovna there to look in those papers that she kept. She found out about the existence of Marya Ivanovna and about her relationship with the late Andronikov quite recently, having already returned to Petersburg.","Kraft didn't know what had actually happened to that letter but remarked that Andronikov would never have torn up such an important paper since he was a man not only ""with a broad mind but also with a broad notion of the permissible""—a judgment showing surprising independence, in view of Kraft's close attachment to and fondness for Andronikov. Kraft seemed convinced that the compromising document ' had wound up in Versilov's hands because of his closeness with Andronikov's widow and daughters, and because he knew that they had allowed him to go through Andronikov's files after his death. Kraft was also convinced that Katerina took it for granted that Versilov had the letter and was afraid he would show it to the old prince. As soon as she had returned from abroad, Katerina had searched for the letter all over Petersburg, including at Andronikov's, and was still searching for it, in the vague hope that it might not be in Versilov's hands; she had even gone to Moscow to look for the letter and begged Maria to check whether it wasn't among the papers she had in her house. She had found out about Maria's existence and of her relations with the late Andronikov only recently, after her return to Petersburg.","Kraft did not quite know what had become of the letter, but observed that Andronikov never tore up papers of consequence, and he was, besides, a man of ""broad principles"" as well as ""broad intelligence."" (I was positively surprised at the independence of Kraft's criticism of Andronikov, whom he had loved and respected so much.) But Kraft felt convinced that Versilov had obtained possession of the compromising document through his close relations with Andronikov's widow and daughters; it was known, indeed, that they had at once, of necessity, handed over all the deceased's papers to Versilov. He knew, too, that Katerina Nikolaevna was already aware that the letter was in Versilov's possession and that she was frightened on account of it, imagining that Versilov would take the letter straight to her old father; that on her return from abroad she had searched for the document in Petersburg, had been at the Andronikovs', and was still hunting for it now, so that she must still have some hope that the letter was not in Versilov's hands; and, finally, that she had gone to Moscow simply with the same object, and had entreated Marie Ivanovna to look for it among the papers that had remained with her. She had only recently, since her return to Petersburg, heard of the existence of Marie Ivanovna, and of the footing on which the latter had stood with Andronikov."

"Гадко мне было, когда, усталый и от ходьбы и от мысли, добрался я вечером, часу уже в восьмом, в Семеновский полк. Совсем уже стемнело, и погода переменилась; было сухо, но подымался скверный петербургский ветер, язвительный и острый, мне в спину, и взвевал кругом пыль и песок. Сколько угрюмых лиц простонародья, торопливо возвращавшегося в углы свои с работы и промыслов! У всякого своя угрюмая забота на лице и ни одной-то, может быть, общей, всесоединяющей мысли в этой толпе! Крафт прав: все врознь. Мне встретился маленький мальчик, такой маленький, что странно, как он мог в такой час очутиться один на улице; он, кажется, потерял дорогу; одна баба остановилась было на минуту его выслушать, но ничего не поняла, развела руками и пошла дальше, оставив его одного в темноте. Я подошел было, но он с чего-то вдруг меня испугался и побежал дальше. Подходя к дому, я решил, что я к Васину никогда не пойду. Когда я всходил на лестницу, мне ужасно захотелось застать наших дома одних, без Версилова, чтоб успеть сказать до его прихода что-нибудь доброе матери или милой моей сестре, которой я в целый месяц не сказал почти ни одного особенного слова. Так и случилось, что его не было дома…","It was disgusting to me when, tired both from walking and from thinking, I reached the Semyonovsky regiment in the evening, already at eight o'clock. It was quite dark now, and the weather had changed; it was dry, but a nasty Petersburg wind, caustic and sharp, was rising at my back, and dust and sand were blowing all around. How many gloomy faces of the common people, hastily returning to their corners from work and crafts! Everyone has his own gloomy concern on his face and not a single, perhaps, common, all-unifying thought in this crowd! Kraft is right: everyone is apart. I met a little boy, so small that it is strange how he could find himself alone in the street at such an hour; he seems to have lost his way; one woman stopped for a moment to listen to him, but did not understand anything, spread her hands and went on, leaving him alone in the dark. I was about to approach, but for some reason he suddenly got scared of me and ran on. Approaching the house, I decided that I would never go to Vassin's. When I went up the stairs, I had a terrible desire to find our houses alone, without Versilov, in order to have time to say something kind to my mother or my dear sister, to whom I had not said a single special word for a whole month. So it happened that he was not at home ...","Tired from the long walk and all that thinking, I felt disgusted and depressed when I reached the Semyonovsky Regiment barracks near which we lived. It was almost eight and already quite dark. The weather had changed: it had cleared up but the stinging, wicked Petersburg wind was blowing more and more strongly in my back, whirling sand and dust around. Gloomy faces flashed by, faces of working people who had finished their daily chores, and were now hurrying toward their grimy dwellings. Every one of them was plunged in his own sordid preoccupations and probably there was not one single idea that they all could share and that could unite that crowd! Kraft was right— everyone is on his own. I saw a little boy, so little in fact that I was surprised he was alone in the street at such an hour. It looked as if he'd lost his way. A woman stopped next to him for a moment, but apparently she couldn't understand what he was saying because she shrugged helplessly and walked on, leaving the child alone in the darkness. I went over to him, but for some reason the sight of me frightened him and he rushed away. As I approached our house, I made up my mind never to go and see Vasin again. Then, walking upstairs, I thought how important it was for me at that moment that Versilov not be home so that I could say something warm and pleasant to my mother before he came back and also to my gentle sister, to whom I had hardly talked at all during the month I'd spent in Petersburg. This time my wish was fulfilled: Versilov was out.","I felt disgusted as I made my way towards Semyonovsky Polk at eight o'clock in the evening, worn out with walking and with thinking.

"Приехал он тогда в деревню «Бог знает зачем», по крайней мере сам мне так впоследствии выразился.

Дворовых в этом имении было значительно много; между ними был и садовник Макар Иванов Долгорукий. Вставлю здесь, чтобы раз навсегда отвязаться: редко кто мог столько вызлиться на свою фамилию, как я, в продолжение всей моей жизни. Это было, конечно, глупо, но это было. Каждый-то раз, как я вступал куда-либо в школу или встречался с лицами, которым, по возрасту моему, был обязан отчетом, одним словом, каждый-то учителишка, гувернер, инспектор, поп – все, кто угодно, спрося мою фамилию и услыхав, что я Долгорукий, непременно находили для чего-то нужным прибавить:","He then came to the village ""God knows why,"" at least he himself put it to me later.

Every time I entered a school somewhere or met people to whom, by my age, I owed a report, in a word, every teacher, tutor, inspector, priest - anyone, anyone, asking my last name and when they heard that I was Dolgoruky, they would certainly find it necessary to add for some reason:","""God knows why"" he went to his Tula estate at that time, or at least that's how he put it to me later.

His young children were, as usual, not with him but with relations. This was always his method with his children, legitimate and illegitimate alike. The house-serfs on this estate were rather numerous, and among them was a gardener called Makar Ivanov Dolgoruky. Here I will note in parenthesis, to relieve my mind once and for all, I doubt whether anyone can ever have raged against his surname as I have all my life; this is stupid, of course, but so it has been.

"Я так и закричал. Передать не могу, до какой степени заныла душа моя! Мы выбежали в коридор. Признаюсь, я не осмелился войти к соседкам и уже потом только увидел несчастную, уже когда ее сняли, да и тут, правда, с некоторого расстояния, накрытую простыней, из-за которой выставлялись две узенькие подошвы ее башмаков. Так и не заглянул почему-то в лицо. Мать была в страшном положении; с нею была наша хозяйка, довольно мало, впрочем, испуганная. Все жильцы квартиры толпились тут же. Их было немного: всего один пожилой моряк, всегда очень ворчливый и требовательный и который, однако, теперь совсем притих, и какие-то приезжие из Тверской губернии, старик и старуха, муж и жена, довольно почтенные и чиновные люди. Не стану описывать всей этой остальной ночи, хлопот, а потом и официальных визитов; вплоть до рассвета я буквально дрожал мелкою дрожью и считал обязанностью не ложиться, хотя, впрочем, ничего не делал. Да и все имели чрезвычайно бодрый вид, даже какой-то особенно ободренный. Васин даже ездил куда-то. Хозяйка оказалась довольно почтенною женщиной, гораздо лучше, чем я предполагал ее. Я убедил ее (и вменяю себе это в честь), что мать оставить нельзя так, одну с трупом дочери, и что хоть до завтра пусть бы она ее перевела в свою комнату. Та тотчас согласилась, и как ни билась и ни плакала мать, отказываясь оставить труп, однако все-таки наконец перешла к хозяйке, которая тотчас же велела поставить самоварчик. После этого и жильцы разошлись по своим комнатам и затворились, но я все-таки ни за что не лег и долго просидел у хозяйки, которая даже рада была лишнему человеку, да еще с своей стороны могущему кое-что сообщить по делу. Самовар очень пригодился, и вообще самовар есть самая необходимая русская вещь, именно во всех катастрофах и несчастиях, особенно ужасных, внезапных и эксцентрических; даже мать выкушала две чашечки, конечно после чрезвычайных просьб и почти насилия. А между тем, искренно говорю, никогда я не видел более жестокого и прямого горя, как смотря на эту несчастную. После первых взрывов рыданий и истерики она даже с охотой начала говорить, и рассказ ее я выслушал жадно. Есть несчастные, особенно из женщин, которым даже необходимо дать как можно больше говорить в таких случаях. Кроме того, есть характеры, так сказать, слишком уж обшарканные горем, долго всю жизнь терпевшие, претерпевшие чрезвычайно много и большого горя, и постоянного по мелочам и которых ничем уже не удивишь, никакими внезапными катастрофами и, главное, которые даже перед гробом любимейшего существа не забудут ни единого из столь дорого доставшихся правил искательного обхождения с людьми. И я не осуждаю; тут не пошлость эгоизма и не грубость развития; в этих сердцах, может быть, найдется даже больше золота, чем у благороднейших на вид героинь, но привычка долгого принижения, инстинкт самосохранения, долгая запуганность и придавленность берут наконец свое. Бедная самоубийца не походила в этом на маменьку. Лицом, впрочем, обе были, кажется, одна на другую похожи, хотя покойница положительно была недурна собой. Мать же была еще не очень старая женщина, лет под пятьдесят всего, такая же белокурая, но с ввалившимися глазами и щеками и с желтыми, большими и неровными зубами. Да и все в ней отзывалось какой-то желтизной: кожа на лице и руках походила на пергамент; темненькое платье ее от ветхости тоже совсем пожелтело, а один ноготь, на указательном пальце правой руки, не знаю почему, был залеплен желтым воском тщательно и аккуратно.","So I screamed. I can't tell you how my soul ached! We ran out into the corridor. I confess that I did not dare to go in to the neighbors, and only later did I see the unfortunate woman, already when they took her off, and here, however, from a certain distance, covered with a sheet, because of which two narrow soles of her shoes were exposed. For some reason, he didn't even look at his face. The mother was in a terrible position; with her was our hostess, rather a little, however, frightened. All the tenants of the apartment crowded right there. There were not many of them: just one elderly sailor, always very grouchy and demanding, who, however, has now completely quieted down, and some visitors from the Tver province, an old man and an old woman, a husband and wife, quite respectable and bureaucratic people. I won't describe the rest of that night, the troubles, and then the official visits; right up to dawn, I literally trembled with a small shiver and considered it my duty not to go to bed, although, by the way, I did nothing. Yes, and everyone looked extremely cheerful, even some especially encouraged. Vasin even went somewhere. The hostess turned out to be a rather respectable woman, much better than I expected her. I convinced her (and I impute it to myself) that the mother cannot be left like this, alone with the corpse of her daughter, and that at least until tomorrow, let her take her to her room. She immediately agreed, and no matter how hard her mother fought and cried, refusing to leave the corpse, nevertheless, she finally went over to the hostess, who immediately ordered that the samovar be put on. After that, the tenants also went to their rooms and shut up, but I still didn’t go to bed for anything and sat for a long time with the hostess, who was even glad to have an extra person, and even for her part, who could report something on the case. The samovar has been very useful, and in general the samovar is the most necessary Russian thing, precisely in all catastrophes and misfortunes, especially terrible, sudden and eccentric ones; even the mother drank two cups, of course after extraordinary requests and almost violence. And meanwhile, I sincerely say, I have never seen a more cruel and direct grief than looking at this unfortunate woman. After the first outbursts of sobs and hysteria, she even began to talk eagerly, and I listened to her story eagerly. There are unfortunates, especially among women, who even need to be allowed to speak as much as possible in such cases. In addition, there are characters, so to speak, too shabby with grief, who have endured for a long time all their lives, who have endured extremely much and great grief, and constant in trifles and who can no longer be surprised by anything, no sudden catastrophes and, most importantly, who even before the grave of their beloved being not a single one of the so dearly acquired rules of seeking treatment of people will be forgotten. And I don't judge; here is not the vulgarity of egoism and not the rudeness of development; in these hearts, perhaps, there is even more gold than in the noblest-looking heroines, but the habit of long humiliation, the instinct of self-preservation, long-term intimidation and oppression finally take their toll. The poor suicide was not like her mother in this. In face, however, both seemed to be similar to each other, although the deceased was positively not bad-looking. The mother was not yet a very old woman, about fifty years old in all, the same blond, but with sunken eyes and cheeks and yellow, large and uneven teeth. Yes, and everything in her reeked of some kind of yellowness: the skin on her face and hands looked like parchment; her dark dress was also completely yellowed from decay, and one nail, on the index finger of her right hand, I don’t know why, was carefully and accurately covered with yellow wax.","I let out a scream. I can't even express how stunned I was. I rushed out into the passage. But I must admit that I didn't dare step into the room next door. I saw the poor girl only after they'd taken her down, and even then I didn't come too close to her. They had covered her with a sheet and just the soles of her shoes stuck out from under it. Somehow I couldn't make myself look into her face. The mother was in a terrible state and the landlady, who had remained quite calm throughout, was by her side. All the other lodgers had gathered there too. They consisted of an elderly seaman, who, although usually peevish and demanding, was now quiet and subdued and an elderly couple from Tver, both of whom looked quite respectable. I won't describe the remaining hours of that night with all the commotion and the arrival of the police. I was shivering all over until dawn and somehow felt it my duty not to go back to bed, although there was really nothing I could do. I noticed how energetic everybody around me seemed. Indeed, it looked as if what had just happened had somehow recharged them with energy. Vasin even rushed off to town on some errand. The landlady turned out to be a much nicer woman than I had thought. I managed to convince her (and I think I must be given credit for this) that the mother should not be allowed to remain with her daughter's body and that the landlady should take her to her own room. The landlady agreed quite readily and, despite the mother's protests and cries that she wouldn't leave her daughter's body, she eventually followed the landlady, who immediately ordered the maid to light the samovar and make some tea. One by one, the other lodgers went back to their rooms, but I stayed at the landlady's for a long time. She was pleased to have someone else there and, for my part, I could tell her a few things that shed some light on what had happened. The samovar was most welcome. In general, it is an indispensable Russian institution, especially in times of great stress, when you are struck by something sudden, unexpected, and outlandish. We finally succeeded in making the mother drink two cups of tea, even if it took a lot of pleading, persuading, and almost force. I believe I have never seen a more profound and genuine despair than that of this wretched mother. But after many violent explosions of sobs and hysterics, she started to talk and then even spoke eagerly as I listened to her with interest. There are people, women especially, whom it helps to talk and talk when they are struck by a catastrophe; also there are some people who have been, as it were, worn away by misery, who have been hurt too often during their lifetime, who have suffered terrible disasters and experienced constant hardships, and who, even within the sight of the dead body of a loved one, never forget the dearly acquired art of getting along with others. I don't say that deprecatingly; it is not a matter of egoism with them, nor a matter of having a thick hide and a lack of refinement: there is perhaps more goodness in such hearts than in certain heroes; it is a reflex of self-preservation, acquired from the long experience of being downtrodden, that ends by dominating their behavior. The dead girl was not at all like her mother that way, although there was a physical resemblance between the two of them. But while the girl had been undeniably pretty, the mother, who was not old yet (fifty or so) and was still blond like her daughter, had sunken cheeks and large, uneven yellowish teeth. As a matter of fact, everything about her had a yellowish tinge, from the parchment-like skin of her face and hands to her dress, just from being so old and worn. And for some strange reason, one fingernail on her right hand had been covered over with yellow wax.","I could not help crying out. I cannot describe the pang at my heart! We ran out into the passage. I must own I did not dare go into the room, and only saw the unhappy girl afterwards, when she had been taken down, and even then, indeed, at some distance and covered with a sheet, beyond which the two narrow soles of her shoes stood out. So I did not for some reason look into her face. The mother was in a fearful condition; our landlady was with her— not, however, greatly alarmed. All the lodgers in the flat had gathered round. There were only three of them: an elderly naval man, always very peevish and exacting, though on this occasion he was quite quiet, and an elderly couple, respectable people of the small functionary class who came from the province of Tver. I won't attempt to describe the rest of that night, the general commotion and afterwards the visit of the police. Literally till daylight I kept shuddering and felt it my duty to sit up, though I did absolutely nothing. And indeed every one had an extraordinarily cheery air, as though they had been particularly cheered by something. Vassin went off somewhere. The landlady turned out to be rather a decent woman, much better than I had imagined her. I persuaded her (and I put it down to my credit) that the mother must not be left alone with the daughter's corpse, and that she must, at least until to-morrow, take her into her room. The landlady at once agreed, and though the mother struggled and shed tears, refusing to leave her daughter, she did at last move into the landlady's room, and the latter immediately ordered the samovar to be brought. After that the lodgers went back to their rooms and shut the doors, but nothing would have induced me to go to bed, and I remained a long time with the landlady, who was positively relieved at the presence of a third person, and especially one who was able to give some information bearing on the case. The samovar was most welcome, and in fact the samovar is the most essential thing in Russia, especially at times of particularly awful, sudden, and eccentric catastrophes and misfortunes; even the mother was induced to drink two cups—though, of course, only with much urging and almost compulsion. And yet I can honestly say that I have never seen a bitterer and more genuine sorrow that that poor mother's. After the first paroxysms of sobbing and hysterics she was actually eager to talk, and I listened greedily to her story. There are unhappy people, especially women, who must be allowed to talk as freely as possible when they are in trouble. Moreover, there are characters too, blurred so to speak by sorrow, who all their life long have suffered, have suffered terribly much both of great sorrow and of continual worry about trifles, and who can never be surprised by anything, by any sort of sudden calamity, and who, above all, never, even beside the coffin of their dearest, can forget the rules of behaviour for propitiating people, which they have learnt by bitter experience. And I don't criticize it: there is neither the vulgarity of egoism nor the insolence of culture in this; there is perhaps more genuine goodness to be found in these simple hearts than in heroines of the loftiest demeanour, but the long habit of humiliation, the instinct of self-preservation, the years of timid anxiety and oppression, leave their mark at last. The poor girl who had died by her own hand was not like her mother in this. They were alike in face, however, though the dead girl was decidedly good-looking. The mother was not a very old woman, fifty at the most; she, too, was fair, but her eyes were sunken, her cheeks were hollow, and she had large yellow, uneven teeth. And indeed everything had a tinge of yellowness: the skin on her hands and face was like parchment; her dark dress had grown yellow with age, and the nail on the forefinger of her right hand[1] had been, I don't know why, carefully and tidily plastered up with yellow wax."
"Назавтра Лиза не была весь день дома, а возвратясь уже довольно поздно, прошла прямо к Макару Ивановичу. Я было не хотел входить, чтоб не мешать им, но, вскоре заметив, что там уж и мама и Версилов, вошел. Лиза сидела подле старика и плакала на его плече, а тот, с печальным лицом, молча гладил ее по головке.","The next day, Liza was not at home all day, and returning quite late, she went straight to Makar Ivanovich. I didn't want to go in so as not to disturb them, but noticing soon that my mother and Versilov were already there, I went in.

At first I didn't want to go in there so as not to disturb them, but when I realized that Mother and Versilov were already with Makar, I went in too. Lisa was sitting next to the old man. Her head was on his shoulder. She was crying as he silently stroked her hair. He looked sad.","Liza was out the whole of the following day, and when she came back, rather late, she went straight to Makar Ivanovitch.

Liza was sitting by the old man crying on his shoulder, and he with a sorrowful face was stroking her head."

"Фабрикой сама супруга стала орудовать, и так, что и теперь вспоминают. Пить не перестал, но стала она его в эти самые дни соблюдать, а потом и лечить. Речь его стала степенная, и даже самый глас изменился. Стал жалостлив беспримерно, даже к скотам: увидал из окна, как мужик стегал лошадь по голове безобразно, и тотчас выслал и купил у него лошадь за вдвое цены. И получил дар слезный: кто бы с ним ни заговорил, так и зальется слезами. Когда же приспело время ее, внял наконец Господь их молитвам и послал им сына, и стал Максим Иванович, еще в первый раз с тех пор, светел; много милостыни роздал, много долгов простил, на крестины созвал весь город. Созвал он это город, а на другой день, как ночь, вышел. Видит супруга, что с ним нечто сталось, и поднесла к нему новорожденного: «Простил, говорит, нас отрок, внял слезам и молитвам за него нашим». А о сем предмете, надо так сказать, они во весь год ни разу не сказали слова, а лишь оба про себя содержали. И поглядел на нее Максим Иванович мрачно, как ночь: «Подожди, говорит: он, почитай, весь год не приходил, а в сию ночь опять приснился». «Тут-то в первый раз проник и в мое сердце ужас, после сих странных слов», – припоминала потом.","The wife herself began to operate the factory, and in such a way that even now they remember. He did not stop drinking, but she began to observe it in those very days, and then to treat it. His speech became sedate, and even his voice changed. He became unparalleledly compassionate, even towards cattle: he saw from the window how a peasant whipped a horse on the head in an ugly way, and immediately sent him and bought a horse from him for twice the price. And he received a tearful gift: whoever spoke to him would burst into tears. When her time came, the Lord finally heeded their prayers and sent them a son, and Maxim Ivanovich became, for the first time since then, bright; He distributed many alms, forgave many debts, called the whole city to the christening. He convened this city, and the next day, like night, he went out. The spouse sees that something has happened to him, and she brought the newborn to him: “Forgive us, he says, the lad, heeded our tears and prayers for him.” And about this subject, it must be said, they never said a word all year, but only kept both of them to themselves. And Maxim Ivanovich looked at her gloomily as the night: “Wait, he says: he, read, he didn’t come all year, but that night he dreamed again.” “It was then that horror entered my heart for the first time, after these strange words,” she later recalled.","It was the wife who took over the running of the mill now, and she turned out to be so good at it that they still remember how well she ran it to this day. He didn't give up his drinking bouts, but now she'd watch over him during those days and try to cure him of this habit. When he spoke to people now, he used only decent words and even his voice was different. He'd become sorry beyond measure when he saw someone in pain, even if it was just an animal. Once he saw out of his window a peasant viciously whipping his horse. He sent someone out to buy the horse from the man for twice its worth. And he received his reward in tears, for whoever spoke to him would have tears in his eyes. And when her time came and God, heeding their prayers, sent them a son, Maxim's gloom lifted at last for the first time and, that day, he gave away lots of money to the poor, forgave many people what they owed him, and invited the whole town to the christening. But the next morning he came out of the house looking black as night. His wife saw something was wrong with him and held the newborn babe up to him. ""He's forgiven us, the boy, he's seen our tears and heard our prayers for him."" That was the first time, mind you , they'd mentioned the boy in a year. Each of them had kept his thoughts about the boy to himself. Maxim just gave her a black look. ""Wait,"" he said, ""the boy hadn't haunted me all year until now, but last night he came to me in my dream."" ""These strange words filled my heart with terror,"" his wife told us later.","His wife began to manage the factory herself, and so well that she's remembered to this day. He did not give up drinking, but she looked after him at those times, and began to nurse him. His language became more decorous, and even his voice changed. He became merciful beyond all wont, even to animals. If he saw from the window a peasant shamelessly beating his horse on the head, he would send out at once, and buy the horse at double its value. And he received the gift of tears. If any one talked to him he melted into tears. When her time had come, God answered their prayers at last, and sent them a son, and for the first time Maxim Ivanovitch became glad; he gave alms freely, and forgave many debts, and invited the whole town to the christening. And next day he was black as night. His wife saw that something was wrong with him, and held up to him the new-born babe. ""The boy has forgiven us,"" she said; ""he has accepted our prayers and our tears for him."" And it must be said they had neither of them said one word on that subject for the whole year, they had kept it from each other in their hearts. And Maxim Ivanovitch looked at her, black as night. ""Wait a bit,"" said he, ""consider, for a whole year he has not come to me, but last night he came in my dream."" ""I was struck to the heart with terror when I heard those strange words,"" she said afterwards."

"– Твоя мать – совершенная противоположность иным нашим газетам, у которых что ново, то и хорошо, – хотел было сострить Версилов поигривее и подружелюбнее; но у него как-то не вышло, и он только пуще испугал маму, которая, разумеется, ничего не поняла в сравнении ее с газетами и озиралась с недоумением.

"– Безбожника человека, – сосредоточенно продолжал старик, – я, может, и теперь побоюсь; только вот что, друг Александр Семенович: безбожника-то я совсем не стречал ни разу, а стречал заместо его суетливого – вот как лучше объявить его надо. Всякие это люди; не сообразишь, какие люди; и большие и малые, и глупые и ученые, и даже из самого простого звания бывают, и все суета. Ибо читают и толкуют весь свой век, насытившись сладости книжной, а сами все в недоумении пребывают и ничего разрешить не могут. Иной весь раскидался, самого себя перестал замечать. Иной паче камене ожесточен, а в сердце его бродят мечты; а другой бесчувствен и легкомыслен и лишь бы ему насмешку свою отсмеять. Иной из книг выбрал одни лишь цветочки, да и то по своему мнению; сам же суетлив, и в нем предрешения нет. Вот что скажу опять: скуки много. Малый человек и нуждается, хлебца нет, ребяток сохранить нечем, на вострой соломке спит, а все в нем сердце веселое, легкое; и грешит и грубит, а все сердце легкое. А большой человек опивается, объедается, на золотой куче сидит, а все в сердце у него одна тоска. Иной все науки прошел – и все тоска. И мыслю так, что чем больше ума прибывает, тем больше и скуки. Да и то взять: учат с тех пор, как мир стоит, а чему же они научили доброму, чтобы мир был самое прекрасное и веселое и всякой радости преисполненное жилище? И еще скажу: благообразия не имеют, даже не хотят сего; все погибли, и только каждый хвалит свою погибель, а обратиться к единой истине не помыслит; а жить без Бога – одна лишь мука. И выходит, что чем освещаемся, то самое и проклинаем, а и сами того не ведаем. Да и что толку: невозможно и быть человеку, чтобы не преклониться; не снесет себя такой человек, да и никакой человек. И Бога отвергнет, так идолу поклонится – деревянному, али златому, аль мысленному. Идолопоклонники это все, а не безбожники, вот как объявить их следует. Ну, а и безбожнику как не быть? Есть такие, что и впрямь безбожники, только те много пострашней этих будут, потому что с именем Божиим на устах приходят. Слышал неоднократно, но не стречал я их вовсе. Есть, друг, такие, и так думаю, что и должны быть они.","“A godless man,” the old man continued with concentration, “perhaps even now I’ll be afraid; only this, friend Alexander Semyonovich: I have never met an atheist at all, but I have met him instead of a fussy one - that's the best way to declare him. All these people; you can't imagine what kind of people; and big and small, and stupid and learned, and even from the simplest rank come, and all is vanity. For they have been reading and interpreting all their lives, having had their fill of the sweetness of books, while they themselves are all perplexed and cannot resolve anything. Others scattered all over, stopped noticing themselves. Some are more bitter than stone, and dreams roam in his heart; while the other is insensitive and frivolous, and if only he could ridicule his own mockery. One of the books chose only flowers, and even then in his own opinion; he himself is fussy, and there is no predecision in him. Here's what I'll say again: there is a lot of boredom. A small man is in need, there is no bread, there is nothing to save the children with, he sleeps on a straw, and everything in him is a cheerful, light heart; and sins and is rude, but the whole heart is light. And the big man gets drunk, overeats, sits on a pile of gold, and all in his heart is one longing. Another has passed all the sciences - and all is melancholy. And I think in such a way that the more mind comes, the more boredom. And even then, to take it: they have been teaching since the time the world was standing, but what did they teach good, so that the world would be the most beautiful and cheerful and a dwelling full of all joy? And I’ll say it again: they don’t have good manners, they don’t even want it; all perished, and only each one praises his own death, but he does not think of turning to the one truth; and to live without God is only torment. And it turns out that by what we are illuminated, we curse the same thing, but we ourselves do not know it. Yes, and what's the point: it is impossible to be a man, so as not to bow down; such a person will not bear himself, and indeed no person. And he will reject God, so he will bow to an idol - wooden, or golden, or mental. Idolaters are all, and not godless, that's how they should be declared. Well, how can you not be an atheist? There are those who are truly atheists, only those will be much more terrible than these, because they come with the name of God on their lips. I heard it many times, but I never met them at all. There are, friend, such, and so I think that they should be.","""Perhaps even now, though,"" Makar went on with concentration, ""I'd be frightened to meet a truly godless man, but let me tell you, Doctor, my friend, I've never really met a man like that. What I have met were restless men, for that's what they should really be called. There are all sorts of people like that and you can't tell what makes them the way they are: some are important, others are little men; some are ignorant, others are learned; and they come from all classes, even the lowest . . . but it's all restlessness. For they keep on reading all their lives and, having filled themselves with bookish wisdom, they talk and talk, although they never find answers to what's bothering them and remain in the darkness. Some of them throw themselves in so many different directions that they end by losing themselves; the hearts of others turn into stones, although there may still be dreams in them; still others become drained of thoughts and feelings but still go around sneering at everything. Some people pick out from books nothing but the little flowers, and even then only those that suit them, but they still remain restless because they could never make up their minds in the first place. And I can see that there's too much boredom in them. A poor man may bo short of bread, may not have enough to keep his children alive, may sleep on rough straw, may be brutal and sinful, but still his heart may be gay and merry; while a rich man may eat and drink too much and sit on a pile of gold with nothing but gloom in his heart. A man may study all the sciences and never get rid of emptiness and gloom; indeed, I think that the more intelligence he gains, the more his gloom will thicken. ""Or let's look at it this way: people have been taught and taught ever since the creation of the world, but what have they learned in all that time to help them make the world a gayer and happier place where man can find all the joys he's longing for? What they lack, I tell you, is beauty. Indeed, they don't even want it. They're all lost and every one of them glories in what has brought him to his ruin. But they never think to face the only truth, although life without God is nothing but torture. What it all comes down to is that, without realizing it, they curse the only source that can brighten our life. But that won't get them anywhere because a man cannot live without worshiping something; without worshiping he cannot bear the burden of himself. And that goes for every man. So that if a man rejects God, he will have to worship an idol that may be made of wood, gold, or ideas. So those who think they don't need God are really just idol worshipers, and that's what we should call them. But there must be true atheists too; only they're much more dangerous because they come to us with the name of God on their lips. I've often heard about them, but I've never come across one yet. There are some people like that, my friends, and there should be.""","""I am afraid of the unbeliever, even now perhaps,"" the old man went on with concentrated intensity; ""only, friend Alexandr Semyonovitch, I tell you what, I've never met an infidel, but I have met worldly men; that's what one must call them. They are of all sorts, big and little, ignorant and learned, and even some of the humblest class, but it's all vanity. They read and argue all their lives, filling themselves with the sweetness of books, while they remain in perplexity and can come to no conclusion. Some quite let themselves go, and give up taking notice of themselves. Some grow harder than a stone and their hearts are full of wandering dreams; others become heartless and frivolous, and all they can do is to mock and jeer. Another will, out of books, gather some flowers, and those according to his own fancy; but he still is full of vanity, and there is no decision in him. And then again: there is a great deal of dreariness. The small man is in want, he has no bread and naught to keep his babes alive with, he sleeps on rough straw, and all the time his heart is light and merry; he is coarse and sinful, yet his heart is light. But the great man drinks too much, and eats too much, and sits on a pile of gold, yet there is nothing in his heart but gloom. Some have been through all the sciences, and are still depressed, and I fancy that the more intellect a man has, the greater his dreariness. And then again: they have been teaching ever since the world began, and to what good purpose have they taught, that the world might be fairer and merrier, and the abode of every sort of joy? And another thing I must tell you: they have no seemliness, they don't even want it at all; all are ruined, but they boast of their own destruction; but to return to the one Truth, they never think; and to live without God is naught but torment. And it seems that we curse that whereby we are enlightened and know it not ourselves: and what's the sense of it? It's impossible to be a man and not bow down to something; such a man could not bear the burden of himself, nor could there be such a man. If he rejects God, then he bows down to an idol—fashioned of wood, or of gold, or of thought. They are all idolaters and not infidels, that is how we ought to describe them—though we can't say there are no infidels. There are men who are downright infidels, only they are far more terrible than those others, for they come with God's name on their lips. I have heard of them more than once, but I have not met them at all. There are such, friend, and I fancy, too, that there are bound to be."""
"«Вы, говорит, маменька, деньги-то подождите тратить», – решительно так сказала. «Что же? – говорю». – «Так, говорит», – оборвала и замолчала. На весь вечер примолкла; только ночью во втором часу просыпаюсь я, слышу, Оля ворочается на кровати: «Не спите вы, маменька?» – «Нет, говорю, не сплю». – «Знаете, говорит, ведь он меня оскорбить хотел?» – «Что ты, что ты? – говорю». – «Непременно, говорит, так: это подлый человек, не смейте, говорит, ни одной копейки его денег тратить». Я было стала ей говорить, всплакнула даже тут же на постели, – отвернулась она к стене: «Молчите, говорит, дайте мне спать!» Наутро смотрю на нее, ходит, на себя непохожа; и вот, верьте не верьте мне, перед судом Божиим скажу: не в своем уме она тогда была! С самого того разу, как ее в этом подлом доме оскорбили, помутилось у ней сердце… и ум. Смотрю я на нее в то утро и сумневаюсь на нее; страшно мне; не буду, думаю, противоречить ей ни в одном слове. «Он, говорит, маменька, адреса-то своего так и не оставил». – «Грех тебе, говорю, Оля: сама его вчера слышала, сама потом хвалила, сама благодарными слезами заплакать готова была». Только я это сказала – взвизгнула она, топнула: «Подлых, говорит, вы чувств женщина, старого вы, говорит, воспитания на крепостном праве!»… И уж что тут не говорила, схватила шляпку, выбежала, я кричу ей вслед: что с ней, думаю, куда побежала? А она бегала в адресный стол, узнала, где господин Версилов живет, пришла: «Сегодня же, говорит, сейчас отнесу ему деньги и в лицо шваркну; он меня, говорит, оскорбить хотел, как Сафронов (это купец-то наш); только Сафронов оскорбил как грубый мужик, а этот как хитрый иезуит». А тут вдруг на беду и постучался этот вчерашний господин: «Слышу, говорят про Версилова, могу сообщить». Как услыхала она про Версилова, так на него и накинулась, в исступлении вся, говорит-говорит, смотрю я на нее и дивлюсь: ни с кем она, молчаливая такая, так не говорит, а тут еще с незнакомым совсем человеком? Щеки у ней разгорелись, глаза сверкают… А он-то как раз: «Совершенная, говорит, ваша правда, сударыня. Версилов, говорит, это точь-в-точь как генералы здешние, которых в газетах описывают; разоденется генерал во все ордена и пойдет по всем гувернанткам, что в газетах публикуются, и ходит и что надо находит; а коли не найдет чего надо, посидит, поговорит, наобещает с три короба и уйдет, – все-таки развлечение себе доставил». Расхохоталась даже Оля, только злобно так, а господин-то этот, смотрю, за руку ее берет, руку к сердцу притягивает: «Я, говорит, сударыня, и сам при собственном капитале состою, и всегда бы мог прекрасной девице предложить, но лучше, говорит, я прежде у ней только миленькую ручку поцелую…» – и тянет, вижу, целовать руку. Как вскочит она, но тут уж и я вместе с ней, прогнали мы его обе. Вот перед вечером выхватила у меня Оля деньги, побежала, приходит обратно: «Я, говорит, маменька, бесчестному человеку отмстила!» – «Ах, Оля, Оля, говорю, может, счастья своего мы лишились, благородного, благодетельного человека ты оскорбила!» Заплакала я с досады на нее, не вытерпела. Кричит она на меня: «Не хочу, кричит, не хочу! Будь он самый честный человек, и тогда его милостыни не хочу! Чтоб и жалел кто-нибудь меня, и того не хочу!» Легла я, и в мысли у меня ничего не было. Сколько я раз на этот гвоздь у вас в стене присматривалась, что от зеркала у вас остался, – невдомек мне, совсем невдомек, ни вчера, ни прежде, и не думала я этого не гадала вовсе, и от Оли не ожидала совсем. Сплю-то я обыкновенно крепко, храплю, кровь это у меня к голове приливает, а иной раз подступит к сердцу, закричу во сне, так что Оля уж ночью разбудит меня: «Что это вы, говорит, маменька, как крепко спите, и разбудить вас, когда надо, нельзя». – «Ой, говорю, Оля, крепко, ой крепко». Вот как я, надо быть, захрапела это вчера, так тут она выждала, и уж не опасаясь, и поднялась. Ремень-то этот от чемодана, длинный, все на виду торчал, весь месяц, еще утром вчера думала: «Прибрать его наконец, чтоб не валялся». А стул, должно быть, ногой потом отпихнула, а чтобы он не застучал, так юбку свою сбоку подложила. И должно быть, я долго-долго спустя, целый час али больше спустя, проснулась: «Оля! – зову, – Оля!» Сразу померещилось мне что-то, кличу ее. Али что не слышно мне дыханья ее с постели стало, али в темноте-то разглядела, пожалуй, что как будто кровать пуста, – только встала я вдруг, хвать рукой: нет никого на кровати, и подушка холодная. Так и упало у меня сердце, стою на месте как без чувств, ум помутился. «Вышла, думаю, она», – шагнула это я, ан у кровати, смотрю, в углу, у двери, как будто она сама и стоит. Я стою, молчу, гляжу на нее, а она из темноты точно тоже глядит на меня, не шелохнется… «Только зачем же, думаю, она на стул встала?» – «Оля, – шепчу я, робею сама, – Оля, слышишь ты?» Только вдруг как будто во мне все озарилось, шагнула я, кинула обе руки вперед, прямо на нее, обхватила, а она у меня в руках качается, хватаю, а она качается, понимаю я все и не хочу понимать… Хочу крикнуть, а крику-то нет… Ах, думаю! Упала на пол с размаха, тут и закричала…»","“You, mother, she says, wait to spend the money,” she said resolutely. ""What? - I say. - ""So, he says,"" she broke off and fell silent. She was silent for the whole evening; only at two o'clock at night I wake up, I hear Olya tossing and turning on the bed: ""Aren't you sleeping, mama?"" - ""No, I say, I'm not sleeping."" “You know, he says, because he wanted to insult me?” “What are you, what are you? - I say. - “Certainly, he says, like this: this is a vile person, don’t dare, he says, to spend a single penny of his money.” I was about to start talking to her, I even cried right there on the bed, she turned away to the wall: “Be quiet, she says, let me sleep!” In the morning I look at her, she walks, she doesn't look like herself; and now, believe me, do not believe me, before the judgment of God I will say: she was out of her mind then! From the very moment she was insulted in this vile house, her heart ... and mind were clouded. I look at her that morning and doubt her; I'm scared; I will not, I think, contradict her in a single word. “He says, mother, he never left his address.” “It’s a sin for you, I say, Olya: she herself heard him yesterday, she later praised him, she herself was ready to cry with grateful tears.” As soon as I said this, she squealed, stomped: “You are a vile, she says, you are a woman of feelings, you are old, she says, you were raised on serfdom!” ... And what didn’t I say, she grabbed her hat, ran out, I shouted after her: what with her, I think, where did she run? And she ran to the address desk, found out where Mr. Versilov lives, came: “Today, she says, now I’ll take the money to him and slam it in the face; he said he wanted to insult me, like Safronov (this is our merchant); only he insulted Safronov as a rude peasant, and this one as a cunning Jesuit. And then suddenly, out of misfortune, this yesterday's gentleman knocked: ""I hear they are talking about Versilov, I can tell you."" As soon as she heard about Versilov, she threw herself at him, all in a frenzy, talking, talking, I look at her and wonder: she, so silent, doesn’t talk like that with anyone, and then with a completely unfamiliar person? Her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkle ... And he just said: “Perfect, he says, your truth, madam. Versilov, he says, is exactly like the local generals who are described in the newspapers; the general will dress up in all the orders and go to all the governesses that are published in the newspapers, and go and find what he needs; and if he doesn’t find what he needs, he sits, talks, promises from three boxes and leaves, he still gave himself entertainment. Even Olya burst out laughing, only angrily, but this gentleman, I see, takes her by the hand, draws his hand to his heart: , she says, first I’ll only kiss her pretty little hand ... ”- and pulls, I see, to kiss her hand. As she jumps up, but here I am with her, we both drove him away. Just before evening, Olya snatched money from me, ran, comes back: “I, she says, mother, took revenge on a dishonorable person!” - “Ah, Olya, Olya, I say, maybe we have lost our happiness, you insulted a noble, beneficent person!” I cried out of annoyance at her, I could not stand it. She screams at me: “I don’t want to, she screams, I don’t want to! If he were the most honest person, then I would not want his alms! So that someone would feel sorry for me, and I don’t want that!” I lay down, and in my thoughts there was nothing. How many times have I looked at this nail in your wall, what was left of your mirror - I didn’t know, I didn’t know at all, neither yesterday nor before, and I didn’t think I didn’t guess at all, and I didn’t expect it from Olya at all. I usually sleep soundly, I snore, the blood rushes to my head, and sometimes it rises to my heart, I scream in my sleep, so that Olya wakes me up at night: I can't wake you up when you need to."" - ""Oh, I say, Olya, hard, oh hard."" That's how I must have snored it yesterday, so here she waited, and without fear, and got up. This strap from a suitcase, long, stuck out in plain sight, all month, yesterday morning I thought: “Finally clean it up so that it doesn’t roll around.” And then she must have pushed the chair with her foot, and so that it would not rattle, she put her skirt on the side. And it must have been a long, long time later, a whole hour or more later, I woke up: “Olya! - I call, - Olya! I immediately imagined something, I call her. Ali that I couldn’t hear her breathing from the bed, or in the darkness I saw, perhaps, that it was as if the bed was empty - I just got up suddenly, grabbing my hand: there was no one on the bed, and the pillow was cold. So my heart sank, I stood still as if without feelings, my mind was clouded. “She came out, I think, she,” I took a step, but by the bed, I look, in the corner, at the door, as if she herself was standing. I stand, I am silent, I look at her, and she, too, looks at me from the darkness, does not move ... “But why, I think, did she stand on a chair?” - “Olya,” I whisper, shy myself, “Olya, do you hear?” Only suddenly, as if everything in me lit up, I took a step, threw both hands forward, right at her, grabbed her, and she swayed in my hands, I grab, and she swayed, I understand everything and don’t want to understand ... I want to shout, but the cry No... Oh, I think! She fell to the floor with a swing, then she screamed ... ""","""'Still, Mother, I want you to wait before you start spending that money.' Her tone was harsh when she said that. "" 'But why, Olga?' "" 'Because that's how it must be.' And she said nothing more all that evening, and, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I woke up and I realized she was not asleep from the way she was turning from one side to the other. ""'Are you awake, Mother?' she asked, and I said, 'Yes, Olga, I'm awake.' ' Do you know,' she said then, 'he was trying to insult me.' ' But why, Olga, what makes you think that?' ' I'm sure I'm right , he's a despicable man and don't you dare spend one single kopek of his money.' I tried to object, I even cried some, but she turned away from me, to the wall: 'Leave me alone, I'm trying to get some sleep.' ""In the morning she got up and started pacing the room with a face all dead and expressionless. I swear to God, after she'd been to that infamous house, she was never quite the same; something must've cracked in her heart and in her mind when they'd insulted her there! So I looked at her that morning with great anguish and I decided not to contradict her any more, whatever she said. "" 'Do you realize, Mother, he didn't leave his address.' "" 'Oh, come now, Olga—you were here when he came yesterday; you yourself had nothing but praise for him, you almost cried out of gratitude. . . .' ""Ah, the way she screamed when I said that! "" Your way of thinking is unspeakable!' she shouted at me. ' Perhaps it's because you were brought up on the old ideas of serfdom!' And that was all she found to say; she just seized her little hat and dashed out of the room while I called after her, worrying terribly what she would do. Actually, she went to the Registry Office and got Mr. Versilov's address. ""'I'll go to his house and throw the money in his face because he wanted to insult me, just like Safronov— that was that merchant, you know—except that Safronov is just an uncouth clod while Versilov is a tricky Jesuit. . . .' ""And it was just then that that gentleman knocked on our door and said that he had heard us mention Versilov's name and could tell us whatever we wished to know about him. ""As soon as he pronounced that name, Olga pounced on him and started to talk and talk as if in a frenzy. I could only stare at her in amazement, for she'd always been so silent and reserved and now she was letting herself go like that with a completely unknown man. Her cheeks were blood red and her eyes were burning. And he seemed to agree with her. ""'You're absolutely right about him, ma'am: Versilov is exactly like those generals who were exposed in the newspapers, the ones who put on their dress uniforms, pin on all their medals, and go and make the rounds of all the governesses who advertise in the papers; they usually find what they're looking for, and if they see it won't work, they just stay for a while, promise God knows what, and depart, feeling satisfied even with that kind of distraction.' ""Olga laughed, but the gentleman didn't understand that she was laughing from rage and so he caught her hand and pulled it toward his heart: ' I dare say, ma'am , I'm also a man of means and I too could easily have offered my services to a beautiful lady, but I'd rather simply kiss her pretty little hand first. . . .' and I saw him pulling her hand toward his lips. ""Ah, the way she jumped to her feet and threw herself at him! I got up too and together we pushed him out of the room. ""Later in the afternoon, Olga took the money from me and left. When she came back, she announced: ""Well, I've punished that despicable man, Mother.' ' Oh, Olga, Olga, you may very well have thrown away our last chance and offended a good and honest man!' I was so outraged at what she'd done I couldn't hold back my tears. Then she started screaming at me: ' No, no, no! I don't want his charity, even if he is the most honorable man in the world! I don't want anyone to be sorry for me! No, no, no!' ""I lay on my bed and my mind was empty: I only remember staring at that nail on the wall where a mirror must've hung once. ... I never thought she could do it, never expected it of my Olga. ... I usually sleep very heavily and I snore , I guess it's the blood going to my head, and sometimes, when it goes to my heart, I scream in my sleep and Olga shakes me and shakes me to bring me out of it. ' Why, Mother,' she'd say, 'you sleep so hard sometimes that it's impossible to wake you up.' ' Yes, Olga, I do sleep very, very hard. . . .' And so, I guess, she waited until I started snoring, and got up, feeling quite sure I wouldn't wake up. She used the long strap from our trunk. It had been lying around and just that morning I'd thought I ought to put it away somewhere so it wouldn't get lost. She must've climbed on a chair and then kicked it out from under her and, to prevent it from banging on the floor , she'd put a skirt under it. 1 think I didn't wake up until at least an hour later. But right away I had a feeling that something wasn't right and I called out 'Olga, Olga!' I don't know what it was, perhaps because I didn't hear her breathing or perhaps because her empty bed looked somehow too flat in the darkness. Then I got up and felt with my hand—the bed was empty all right, and her pillow was cold. My heart sank at once and I didn't know what to do. Maybe she's gone out, I decided, but then I thought I saw her standing there in the corner, by the door. I looked at her and she seemed to be looking back at me in the darkness, without moving. But why should she be standing on a chair? I wondered, and I whispered to her: 'Olga, Olga, can you hear me?' But then somehow I suddenly understood: I stretched out both hands toward her and seized her; I threw my arms around her. She swayed in my arms. ... I understood everything, but I refused to understand; I wanted to scream but no sound came out of me. . . . 'Ah!' I thought as I was still holding onto her and swaying to and fro. Then, I suddenly let go and fell down on the floor. It was only then that I could scream.","Well, I was pleased, but an hour later she turned to me: 'Don't spend that money yet, mamma,' said she resolutely. ' What?' said I. ' I mean it,' she said, and she broke off and said no more. She was silent all the evening, only at two o'clock in the night I waked up and heard Olya tossing in her bed: 'Are you awake, mamma?' ' Yes, I am awake.' ' Do you know, he meant to insult me.' ' What nonsense, what nonsense,' I said. ' There is no doubt of it,' she said; 'he is a vile man; don't dare to spend a farthing of his money.' I tried to talk to her. I burst out crying, in bed as I was. She turned away to the wall. ' Be quiet,' she said, 'let me go to sleep!' In the morning I looked at her; she was not like herself. And you may believe it or not, before God I swear she was not in her right mind then! From the time that she was insulted in that infamous place there was darkness and perplexity in her heart … and in her brain. Looking at her that morning, I had misgivings about her; I was alarmed. I made up my mind I would not say a word to contradict her. ' He did not even leave his address, mamma,' she said. ' For shame, Olya,' I said; 'you listened to him last night; you praised him and were ready to shed tears of gratitude.' That was all I said, but she screamed and stamped. ' You are a woman of low feelings,' she said, 'brought up in the old slavish ideas… .' And then, without a word, she snatched up her hat, ran out. I called after her. I wondered what was the matter with her, where she had run. She had run to the address bureau to find out where Versilov lived. ' I'll take him back the money today and fling it in his face; he meant to insult me,' she said, 'like Safronov (that is the merchant), but Safronov insulted me like a coarse peasant, but he like a cunning Jesuit.' And just then, unhappily, that gentleman knocked at the door: 'I hear the name of Versilov,' he said; 'I can tell you about him.' When she heard Versilov's name she pounced on him. She was in a perfect frenzy; she kept talking away. I gazed at her in amazement. She was always a silent girl and had never talked to anyone like that, and with a perfect stranger too. Her cheeks were burning, her eyes glittered… . And he said at once: 'You are perfectly right, madam. Versilov,' said he, 'is just like the generals here, described in the newspapers; they dress themselves up with all their decorations and go after all the governesses who advertise in the papers. Sometimes they find what they want, or, if they don't, they sit and talk a little, make bushels of promises and go away, having got diversion out of it, anyway.' Olya actually laughed, but so bitterly, and I saw the gentleman take her hand and press it to his heart. ' I am a man of independent means, madam,' said he, 'and might well make a proposal to a fair maiden, but I'd better,' said he, 'kiss your little hand to begin with… .' And he was trying to kiss her hand. How she started! But I came to the rescue, and together we turned him out of the room. Then, towards evening, Olya snatched the money from me and ran out. When she came back she said, 'I have revenged myself on that dishonourable man, mamma.' ' Oh, Olya, Olya,' I said, 'perhaps we have thrown away our happiness. You have insulted a generous, benevolent man!' I cried— I was so vexed with her I could not help it. She shouted at me. ' I won't have it, I won't have it!' she cried; 'if he were ever so honest, I don't want his charity! I don't want anyone to pity me!' I went to bed with no thought of anything. How many times I had looked on that nail in your wall where once there had been a looking-glass —it never entered my head, never; I never thought of it yesterday and I'd never thought of it before; I had no inkling of it, and I did not expect it of Olya at all. I usually sleep heavily and snore; it's the blood going to my head, and sometimes it goes to my heart. I call out in my sleep so that Olya wakes me up at night. ' What is the matter with you, mamma?' she would say; 'you sleep so heavily there's no waking you.' ' Oh, Olya,' I said, 'I do, I do.' That's how I must have slept this night, so that, after waiting a bit, she got up without fear of waking me. The strap, a long one from our trunk, had been lying about all that month where we could see it; only yesterday morning I had been thinking of tidying it away. And the chair she must have kicked away afterwards, and she had put her petticoat down beside it to prevent its banging on the floor. And it must have been a long time afterwards, a whole hour or more afterwards, that I waked up and called 'Olya, Olya'; all at once I felt something amiss, and called her name. Either because I did not hear her breathing in her bed, or perhaps I made out in the dark that the bed was empty— anyway, I got up suddenly and felt with my hand; there was no one in the bed and the pillow was cold. My heart sank; I stood still as though I were stunned; my mind was a blank. ' She's gone out,' I thought. I took a step, and by the bed I seemed to see her standing in the corner by the door. I stood still and gazed at her without speaking, and through the darkness she seemed to look at me without stirring… . ' But why has she got on a chair,' I wondered. ' Olya,' I whispered. I was frightened. ' Olya, do you hear?' But suddenly, as it were, it all dawned upon me. I went forward, held out both arms and put them round her, and she swayed in my arms; I swayed and she swayed with me. I understood and would not understand… . I wanted to cry out, but no cry came… . Ach! I fell on the floor and shrieked… ."""
"Анна Андреевна, лишь только обо мне доложили, бросила свое шитье и поспешно вышла встретить меня в первую свою комнату – чего прежде никогда не случалось. Она протянула мне обе руки и быстро покраснела. Молча провела она меня к себе, подсела опять к своему рукоделью, меня посадила подле; но за шитье уже не принималась, а все с тем же горячим участием продолжала меня разглядывать, не говоря ни слова.","Anna Andreevna, as soon as I was reported, gave up her sewing and hurriedly went out to meet me in her first room - which had never happened before. She held out both her hands to me and quickly blushed. Silently she led me to her, sat down again to her needlework, sat me down beside her; but she no longer took up sewing, but continued to look at me with the same ardent interest, without saying a word.","As soon as the servant announced my arrival, Anna put down her sewing and rushed out to meet me, something she'd never done before. She held out both hands and suddenly turned red. Without a word, she showed me in and sat down with her needlework, pointing at a chair next to her where she wanted me to sit. But, instead of resuming her sewing, she went on looking at me with the same fervent sympathy, still never uttering a word.","As soon as I was announced, Anna Andreyevna threw down her sewing and rushed to meet me in the outermost of her rooms, a thing which had never happened before.

"– Да, в Луге, прошлого года, – совершенно просто ответила она, садясь подле и ласково на меня посмотрев. Не знаю почему, мне казалось, что она так и вспыхнет, когда я ей расскажу про Васина. Сестра была блондинка, светлая блондинка, совсем не в мать и не в отца волосами; но глаза, овал лица были почти как у матери. Нос очень прямой, небольшой и правильный; впрочем, и еще особенность – мелкие веснушки в лице, чего совсем у матери не было. Версиловского было очень немного, разве тонкость стана, не малый рост и что-то такое прелестное в походке. Со мной же ни малейшего сходства; два противоположные полюса.","“Yes, in Luga, last year,” she answered quite simply, sitting down beside me and looking at me affectionately. I don’t know why, it seemed to me that she would flare up when I told her about Vasin. The sister was a blonde, a fair blonde, not at all like her mother's or her father's hair; but the eyes, the oval of the face were almost like those of the mother. The nose is very straight, small and regular; however, and another feature - small freckles in the face, which the mother did not have at all. There was very little Versilovsky, except for the thinness of his waist, his short stature, and something so charming in his gait. With me, not the slightest resemblance; two opposite poles.","""I met Mr. Vasin last year in Luga,"" Lisa answered with complete simplicity as she sat down and looked at me gently. Somehow I'd expected that she'd become terribly red when I spoke to her of Vasin. Lisa was very blond, almost towheaded, quite unlike our dark-haired parents. But her eyes and the oval shape of her face were just like Mother's. Her nose was very straight, regular, and just the right length. But her face, unlike Mother's, was freckled. From Versilov she'd inherited perhaps only his slender waist, his tallness, and his characteristic grace of movement. And there was not the slightest resemblance between the two of us—in fact, we were just about opposites.","""Yes, last year in Luga,"" she answered quite simply, sitting down beside me and looking at me affectionately. I don't know why, but I had fancied she would flush when I spoke of Vassin. My sister was a blonde; very fair with flaxen hair, quite unlike both her parents. But her eyes and the oval of her face were like our mother's. Her nose was very straight, small, and regular; there were tiny freckles in her face, however, of which there was no sign in my mother's. There was very little resemblance to Versilov, nothing but the slenderness of figure, perhaps, her tallness and something charming in her carriage. There was not the slightest likeness between us—we were the opposite poles."

"Была ли во мне злоба? Не знаю, может быть, была. Странно, во мне всегда была, и, может быть, с самого первого детства, такая черта: коли уж мне сделали зло, восполнили его окончательно, оскорбили до последних пределов, то всегда тут же являлось у меня неутолимое желание пассивно подчиниться оскорблению и даже пойти вперед желаниям обидчика: «Нате, вы унизили меня, так я еще пуще сам унижусь, вот смотрите, любуйтесь!» Тушар бил меня и хотел показать, что я – лакей, а не сенаторский сын, и вот я тотчас же сам вошел тогда в роль лакея. Я не только подавал ему одеваться, но я сам схватывал щетку и начинал счищать с него последние пылинки, вовсе уже без его просьбы или приказания, сам гнался иногда за ним со щеткой, в пылу лакейского усердия, чтоб смахнуть какую-нибудь последнюю соринку с его фрака, так что он сам уже останавливал меня иногда: «Довольно, довольно, Аркадий, довольно». Он придет, бывало, снимет верхнее платье – а я его вычищу, бережно сложу и накрою клетчатым шелковым платочком. Я знаю, что товарищи смеются и презирают меня за это, отлично знаю, но мне это-то и любо: «Коли захотели, чтоб я был лакей, ну так вот я и лакей, хам – так хам и есть». Пассивную ненависть и подпольную злобу в этом роде я мог продолжать годами. И что же? У Зерщикова я крикнул на всю залу, в совершенном исступлении: «Донесу на всех, рулетка запрещена полицией!» И вот клянусь, что и тут было нечто как бы подобное: меня унизили, обыскали, огласили вором, убили – «ну так знайте же все, что вы угадали, я – не только вор, но я – и доносчик!» Припоминая теперь, я именно так подвожу и объясняю; тогда же было вовсе не до анализа; крикнул я тогда без намерения, даже за секунду не знал, что так крикну: само крикнулось – уж черта такая в душе была.","Was there malice in me? I don't know, maybe there was. Strange, I always had, and perhaps from the very first childhood, such a feature: if they did evil to me, made up for it completely, insulted me to the last limits, then I always immediately had an insatiable desire to passively submit to the insult and even go forward to the wishes of the offender: “Nate, you humiliated me, so I will humiliate myself even more, look, admire!” Touchard beat me and wanted to show that I was a lackey, and not a senatorial son, and so I immediately entered into the role of a lackey myself. I not only handed him his clothes, but I myself grabbed the brush and began to brush off the last specks of dust from him, completely without his request or order, I myself sometimes chased after him with a brush, in the heat of lackey zeal, in order to brush off some last speck from his dress coat, so that he himself would stop me sometimes: ""Enough, enough, Arkady, enough."" He would come, used to take off his outer dress - and I would clean it, fold it carefully and cover it with a checkered silk handkerchief. I know that my comrades laugh and despise me for it, I know it very well, but that’s what I like: “If they wanted me to be a lackey, well, then I’m a lackey, boor - so boor is.” Passive hatred and underground malice of this kind I could continue for years. And what? At Zershchikov's, I shouted to the whole hall, in a complete frenzy: ""I will inform everyone, roulette is prohibited by the police!"" And now I swear that there was something like this here too: I was humiliated, searched, branded a thief, killed - “well, you know everything that you guessed, I am not only a thief, but I am also an informer!” Remembering now, I just sum it up and explain it; at that time there was no time for analysis at all; I shouted then without intention, I didn’t even know for a second that I would shout like that: I shouted out on my own - there was such a devil in my soul.","Was I full of bitterness? I don't know, perhaps I was very bitter. But there was a strange feature in me, a feature that had existed since my earliest childhood perhaps: If I was treated badly, absolutely wronged, thoroughly insulted and humiliated, I always felt an irresistible desire to submit passively to my humiliations and to the whims of my humiliator, even to anticipate those whims. "" All right, you've humiliated me and now I'll wallow in the dirt even more, so just watch and enjoy the sight!"" Touchard used to beat me to prove that I was the son not of a senator but of a flunkey, so I immediately adapted myself to the role of a flunkey. Not only would I hand him his clothes as he dressed but, of my own accord, I'd grab a clothesbrush and start brushing the last specks of dust off him without his order or request; indeed, at times I'd pursue him, brush in hand, seized by a sort of flunkeyish enthusiasm to remove every last particle from his frock coat until he himself would stop me, saying: ""That'll do, Arkady, that'll do for now."" Sometimes he'd come in and remove his overcoat, and I'd brush it, fold it carefully, and cover it with a checked silk kerchief. I was well aware that my comrades laughed at me and despised me for this, but that was just what gave me special pleasure: "" Well, since you wanted me to be a lackey, I became a lackey, and if you wish me to be a pig, I'll be a pig!"" Such a passive hatred and underground spite I could keep up for years. And yet, at Zershikov's, I'd yelled frantically, so the whole room could hear me, that I would report them to the police for playing roulette—a forbidden game—on the premises. But the feeling underlying my outburst could be explained by the following reasoning: ""You've humiliated me, searched me, called me a thief, crushed me, all right, so you may as well know that you've guessed right and, besides being a thief, I'm also a stool pigeon! "" This is the explanation I have to offer now as I look back at that episode, although at the time I had other things to think of than an analysis of my actions. The words I had shouted out hadn't been planned and, in fact, a second before I had no idea of what I'd say; the words came out by themselves; there was in my mental make-up that ""trait"" I mentioned earlier.","Was there resentment in my heart? I don't know, perhaps there was. Strange to say, I always had, perhaps from my earliest childhood, one characteristic: if I were ill-treated, absolutely wronged and insulted to the last degree, I always showed at once an irresistible desire to submit passively to the insult, and even to accept more than my assailant wanted to inflict upon me, as though I would say: ""All right, you have humiliated me, so I will humiliate myself even more; look, and enjoy it!"" Touchard beat me and tried to show I was a lackey, and not the son of a senator, and so I promptly took up the rôle of a lackey. I not only handed him his clothes, but of my own accord I snatched up the brush and began brushing off every speck of dust, without any request or order from him, and ran after him brush in hand, in a glow of menial devotion, to remove some particle of dirt from his dress-coat, so much so that he would sometimes check me himself and say, ""That's enough, Arkady, that's enough."" He would come and take off his overcoat, and I would brush it, fold it carefully, and cover it with a check silk handkerchief. I knew that my school-fellows used to laugh at me and despise me for it , I knew it perfectly well, but that was just what gratified me: ""Since they want me to be a lackey, well, I am a lackey then ; if I'm to be a cad, well, I will be a cad. "" I could keep up a passive hatred and underground resentment in that way for years. Well, at Zerstchikov's I had shouted to the whole room in an absolute frenzy: ""I will inform against you all—roulette is forbidden by the police!"" And I swear that in that case, too, there was something of the same sort: I was humiliated, searched, publicly proclaimed a thief, crushed. "" Well then I can tell you, you have guessed right , I am worse than a thief, I am an informer. "" Recalling it now, that is how I explain it; at the time I was incapable of analysis; I shouted that at the time unintentionally, I did not know indeed a second before that I should say it: it shouted itself—the CHARACTERISTIC was there already in my heart."

"Она с большими открытыми глазами слушала всю эту дикую тираду; она видела, что я сам дрожу. Несколько раз она приподымала с милым, опасливым жестом свою гантированную ручку, чтоб остановить меня, но каждый раз отнимала ее в недоумении и страхе назад. Иногда даже быстро отшатывалась вся назад. Два-три раза улыбка опять просвечивалась было на ее лице; одно время она очень покраснела, но под конец решительно испугалась и стала бледнеть. Только что я приостановился, она протянула было руку и как бы просящим, но все-таки плавным голосом промолвила:","She listened with large open eyes to this whole wild tirade; she saw that I myself was trembling.

Still, I remember very clearly the pleasant feeling it gave me.","And, lo and behold! contrary to all my expectations, after shaking hands with the prince and exchanging a few light, conventional phrases with him, she looked at me with marked curiosity, and, seeing that I too was looking at her, bowed to me with a smile.

"Он вошел очень довольный собой, так довольный, что и нужным не нашел скрыть свое расположение. Да и вообще он привык перед нами, в последнее время, раскрываться без малейшей церемонии, и не только в своем дурном, но даже в смешном, чего уж всякий боится; между тем вполне сознавал, что мы до последней черточки все поймем. В последний год он, по замечанию Татьяны Павловны, очень опустился в костюме: одет был всегда прилично, но в старом и без изысканности. Это правда, он готов был носить белье по два дня, что даже огорчало мать; это у них считалось за жертву, и вся эта группа преданных женщин прямо видела в этом подвиг. Шляпы он всегда носил мягкие, широкополые, черные; когда он снял в дверях шляпу – целый пук его густейших, но с сильной проседью волос так и прянул на его голове. Я любил смотреть на его волосы, когда он снимал шляпу.","He entered very pleased with himself, so pleased that he did not find it necessary to hide his disposition. And in general, he has become accustomed to revealing himself to us, lately, without the slightest ceremony, and not only in his bad, but even in the ridiculous, which everyone is afraid of; meanwhile, he was fully aware that we would understand everything to the last line. In the last year, as Tatyana Pavlovna remarked, he had become very despicable in his suit: he was always decently dressed, but in old clothes and without sophistication. It's true, he was ready to wear underwear for two days, which even upset his mother; they considered this as a sacrifice, and this whole group of devoted women directly saw this as a feat. He always wore soft, wide-brimmed, black hats; when he took off his hat at the door - a whole bunch of his thickest, but with a strong gray hair, and spun on his head. I loved looking at his hair when he took off his hat.","He was so pleased with himself when he came in that he didn't even attempt to hide it. Besides, lately he had stopped bothering to control himself in our presence and allowed us to see not only his evil side but also his ridiculous side, which most people are afraid to reveal. And we certainly did see it down to the last detail. According to Mrs. Prutkov, during this last year he had increasingly lost interest in his appearance and, although he was still decently dressed, his suits began to look old and he wore them without his former distinction. He had decided, for instance, to change his shirt and underwear only every other day. This made Mother very sad and was considered in the house as a great sacrifice on his part, which the collection of admiring females around him described as ""heroic."" In the passage he took off his soft, wide-brimmed felt hat, the kind he always wore, and a shock of thick hair streaked with silver sprang up. I always liked to look at his hair come to life as he took off his hat.","He came in very much pleased with himself, so pleased that he did not feel it necessary to conceal his state of mind. And, indeed, he had become accustomed of late to displaying himself before us without the slightest ceremony, not only in his bad points but even where he was ridiculous, a thing which most people are afraid to do; at the same time, he fully recognized that we should understand to the smallest detail. In the course of the last year, so Tatyana Pavlovna observed, he had become slovenly in his dress: his clothes though old were always well cut and free from foppishness. It is true that he was prepared to put on clean linen only on every alternate day, instead of every day, which was a real distress to my mother; it was regarded by them as a sacrifice, and the whole group of devoted women looked upon it as an act of heroism. He always wore soft wide-brimmed black hats. When he took off his hat his very thick but silvery locks stood up in a shock on his head; I liked looking at his hair when he took off his hat."
"«А опачкаюсь я или не опачкаюсь сегодня?» – молодцевато подумал я про себя, хотя слишком знал, что раз сделанный сегодняшний шаг будет уже решительным и непоправимым на всю жизнь. Но нечего говорить загадками.","“Will I get dirty or not get dirty today?” I thought valiantly to myself, although I knew too well that once taken today's step would already be decisive and irreparable for the rest of my life. But there is nothing to say in riddles.","""Will I or won't I fall on my face today?"" I asked myself cheerfully, although I knew full well that what happened today would affect the rest of my life decisively and irreversibly. But there's no point talking in riddles.","""Shall I disgrace myself to-day or not?"" I thought to myself with a swagger, though I knew that the step once taken that day would be decisive, and could not be retrieved all my life. But it's no use talking in riddles."

"– Теперь? Измучен? – повторил он опять мои слова, останавливаясь передо мной, как бы в каком-то недоумении. И вот вдруг тихая, длинная, вдумчивая улыбка озарила его лицо, и он поднял перед собой палец, как бы соображая. Затем, уже совсем опомнившись, схватил со стола распечатанное письмо и бросил его передо мною:","- Now? Exhausted? he repeated my words again, stopping in front of me, as if in some kind of bewilderment. And then suddenly a quiet, long, thoughtful smile lit up his face, and he raised his finger in front of him, as if thinking. Then, already quite coming to his senses, he grabbed the opened letter from the table and threw it in front of me:","""Miserable? Even now?"" he repeated my words. He ceased pacing up and down the room and stopped, looking at me with surprise. Gradually a slow, distant smile lighted up his features and he held up one finger as if working something out. Then, snapping out of it completely, he picked up an open letter from his desk and tossed it to me.","""How harassed!"" he repeated my words again, standing still before me as though in some perplexity. And suddenly a slow, gentle, dreamy smile lighted up his whole face, and he held up his finger as though considering. Then as though waking up, he took from the table an open letter, and flung it down in front of me."
"Но я не слушал, я ставил зря и уже не на zero. Я поставил целую пачку радужных на восемнадцать первых.","But I did not listen, I bet in vain and no longer at zero. I put a whole bunch of rainbows on the eighteen first.","But then I stopped listening. I was now staking haphazardly, no longer sticking to the zero. I placed a whole pile of bills on the first eighteen numbers.","But I did not listen, I was staking at random, not on zero this time. I staked a whole heap of hundred rouble notes on the first eighteen numbers."
– А потом куда? – спросил он как-то сурово и смотря в землю.,"- And then where? he asked somewhat sternly, looking at the ground.","""And where do I go from there?"" he asked with a strange grimness, looking at his feet.","""And what then?"" he asked almost sullenly, keeping his eyes on the ground."
"– О, по крайней мере я с ним вчера расплатился, и хоть это с сердца долой! Лиза, знает мама? Да как не знать: вчера-то, вчера-то она поднялась на меня!.. Ах, Лиза! Да неужто ты решительно во всем себя считаешь правой, так-таки ни капли не винишь себя? Я не знаю, как это судят по-теперешнему и каких ты мыслей, то есть насчет меня, мамы, брата, отца… Знает Версилов?","- Oh, at least I paid him off yesterday, and at least it's out of my heart! Lisa, does mom know? Yes, how not to know: yesterday, yesterday, she climbed on me! .. Ah, Liza! But do you really consider yourself right in everything, so you don’t blame yourself a bit? I don't know how they judge it today and what are your thoughts, that is, about me, mother, brother, father... Does Versilov know?","""At least I paid him what I owed him yesterday—and that's a load off my heart! . . . Tell me, does Mother know? She must because, otherwise, why would she've pounced on me like that yesterday? Ah, Lisa, do you really consider that you're absolutely blameless in all this, that you have nothing to reproach yourself for?

I don't know how these things are considered nowadays, and what are your ideas, I mean as regards me, your mother, your brother, your father… . Does Versilov know?"""
"А Лизу я не «забыл», мама ошиблась. Чуткая мать видела, что между братом и сестрой как бы охлаждение, но дело было не в нелюбви, а скорее в ревности. Объясню, ввиду дальнейшего, в двух словах.","But I didn’t “forget” Lisa, my mother was mistaken. A sensitive mother saw that there was a kind of cooling between brother and sister, but it was not a matter of dislike, but rather of jealousy. I will explain, in view of what follows, in a nutshell.","But about Lisa, Mother was wrong. I hadn't forgotten her. Sensitive as she was, Mother had noticed a certain coolness between brother and sister, but if there was something of that sort it wasn't from lack of affection but rather from jealousy. To make further developments clearer, I'd better say a few words about that now.","I had not 'forgotten' Liza; mother was mistaken. The keen-sighted mother saw that there was something like coolness between brother and sister, but it was rather jealousy than lack of love. In view of what followed, I will explain in a couple of words."
"Вот она-то не только не отклонила супружеские наклонности мрачного Макара Долгорукого (говорили, что он был тогда мрачен), но, напротив, для чего-то в высшей степени их поощрила. Софья Андреева (эта восемнадцатилетняя дворовая, то есть мать моя) была круглою сиротою уже несколько лет; покойный же отец ее, чрезвычайно уважавший Макара Долгорукого и ему чем-то обязанный, тоже дворовый, шесть лет перед тем, помирая, на одре смерти, говорят даже, за четверть часа до последнего издыхания, так что за нужду можно бы было принять и за бред, если бы он и без того не был неправоспособен, как крепостной, подозвав Макара Долгорукого, при всей дворне и при присутствовавшем священнике, завещал ему вслух и настоятельно, указывая на дочь: «Взрасти и возьми за себя». Это все слышали. Что же до Макара Иванова, то не знаю, в каком смысле он потом женился, то есть с большим ли удовольствием или только исполняя обязанность. Вероятнее, что имел вид полного равнодушия. Это был человек, который и тогда уже умел «показать себя». Он не то чтобы был начетчик или грамотей (хотя знал церковную службу всю и особенно житие некоторых святых, но более понаслышке), не то чтобы был вроде, так сказать, дворового резонера, он просто был характера упрямого, подчас даже рискованного; говорил с амбицией, судил бесповоротно и, в заключение, «жил почтительно», – по собственному удивительному его выражению, – вот он каков был тогда. Конечно, уважение он приобрел всеобщее, но, говорят, был всем несносен. Другое дело, когда вышел из дворни: тут уж его не иначе поминали как какого-нибудь святого и много претерпевшего. Об этом я знаю наверно.","So she not only did not reject the marital inclinations of the gloomy Makar Dolgoruky (they said that he was then gloomy), but, on the contrary, encouraged them to the highest degree for something. Sofya Andreyeva (this eighteen-year-old yard servant, that is, my mother) had been an orphan for several years; her late father, who highly respected Makar Dolgoruky and was indebted to him for something, was also a yard servant, six years before, dying on his deathbed, they even say, a quarter of an hour before his last gasp, so that one could take it for need delirium, if he had not already been incompetent, like a serf, having called Makar Dolgoruky, with all the household and with the priest present, bequeathed to him loudly and urgently, pointing to his daughter: ""Grow up and take care of yourself."" Everyone heard it. As for Makar Ivanov, I don’t know in what sense he later married, that is, with great pleasure or only in fulfillment of his duty. Most likely, he had an air of complete indifference. He was a man who even then already knew how to ""show himself."" It was not that he was a reader or literate (although he knew the whole church service and especially the life of some saints, but more from hearsay), not that he was like, so to speak, a courtyard reasoner, he simply had a stubborn character, sometimes even risky; he spoke with ambition, judged irrevocably, and, in conclusion, ""lived respectfully"" - in his own amazing expression - that's what he was then. Of course, he gained universal respect, but, they say, he was unbearable to everyone. Another thing is when he left the servants: here he was no other way commemorated as some kind of saint and who had endured a lot. I probably know about this.","When gloomy Makar (they say he was gloomy in those days) announced his wish to get married, far from refusing him her permission, Mrs. Prutkov for some reason eagerly encouraged him. Sofia, the eighteen-year-old serf girl in question—my mother, that is—had lost both her parents six years earlier. Her father, who had also been a serf and was under some obligation to Makar, whom he greatly respected, had asked for him as he lay dying and, in the presence of the priest and the assembled servants, had pointed meaningfully to his daughter and said to Makar: ""Bring her up and take her as your wife."" Since, as it turned out, all this happened only fifteen minutes before he breathed his last, these words could be dismissed as delirious raving, although there was no need even for that since a serf had no right to dispose of anything anyway. Still, they all heard what he said. As to Makar Dolgoruky, I don't really know how he felt when he finally married Sofia , I mean whether he wanted to or was just doing what he considered his duty. Most likely he went through with it with an air of complete indifference. Even at that time he knew how to present a dignified picture of himself to the world. Since he was neither educated nor even very literate (his knowledge of the church service and of the lives of some saints was derived mostly from hearing them), he was not at all one of those home-grown back yard philosophers. In fact, he was an obstinate and at times brash man who talked with self-assurance, was very definite in his judgments, and lived ""respectfully,"" as he put it rather strangely. That's what he was like at the time, and obviously these ways made everyone respect him, although I've heard it said that he was quite unbearable. It was quite a different matter, though, when he was emancipated and left the estate; then he was remembered as some sort of martyr and saint. I know that for sure.","Well, far from checking the gloomy Makar Dolgoruky's matrimonial inclinations (I am told he was gloomy in those days), she gave them the warmest encouragement. Sofia Andreyevna, the serf-girl of eighteen (that is, my mother), had been for some years fatherless and motherless. Her father, also a serf, who had a great respect for Makar Dolgoruky and was under some obligation to him, had six years before, on his death- bed, beckoned to the old gardener and, pointing significantly to his daughter, had, in the presence of the priest and all the servants, bequeathed her to him, saying, ""When she's grown up, marry her. "" This was, so they say, a quarter of an hour before he expired, so that it might, if need be, have been put down to delirium; besides which, he had no right to dispose of property, being a serf. Every one heard his words. As for Makar Ivanovitch, I don't know in what spirit he afterwards entered upon the marriage, whether with great eagerness or simply as the fulfilment of a duty. Probably he preserved an appearance of complete indifference. He was a man who even at that time knew how to ""keep up his dignity. "" It was not that he was a particularly well- educated or reading man (though he knew the whole of the church service and some lives of the saints, but this was only from hearing them). It was not that he was a sort of backstairs philosopher; it was simply that he was a man of obstinate, and even at times rash character, was conceited in his talk, autocratic in his judgment, and ""respectful in his life,"" to use his own surprising expression; that is what he was like at that time. Of course, he was universally respected, but, I am told, disliked by every one. It was a different matter when he ceased to be a house- serf; then he was spoken about as a saint and a man who had suffered much. That I know for a fact."
– Да чего ты все трусишь? – опять засмеялся он.,- Why are you all cowardly? he laughed again.,"""I see you're still scared,"" he said and laughed again.","""But why are you always so frightened?"" he laughed again."
"И я все рассказал ему, уже стоя со шляпой в руке. Он ничего не знал. Он быстро осведомился о подробностях, преимущественно времени, места и о степени достоверности. Я, конечно, не скрыл, что это, по рассказам, произошло тотчас вслед за его вчерашним визитом к Анне Андреевне. Не могу выразить, какое болезненное впечатление произвело на него это известие; лицо его исказилось, как бы перекосилось, кривая улыбка судорожно стянула губы; под конец он ужасно побледнел и глубоко задумался, потупив глаза. Я вдруг слишком ясно увидел, что самолюбие его было страшно поражено вчерашним отказом Анны Андреевны. Может быть, ему слишком уж ярко, при болезненном настроении его, представилась в эту минуту вчерашняя смешная и унизительная роль его перед этой девицей, в согласии которой, как оказывалось теперь, он был все время так спокойно уверен. И, наконец, может быть, мысль, что сделал такую подлость перед Лизой и так задаром! Любопытно то, за кого эти светские франты почитают друг друга и на каких это основаниях могут они уважать друг друга; ведь этот князь мог же предположить, что Анна Андреевна уже знает о связи его с Лизой, в сущности с ее сестрой, а если не знает, то когда-нибудь уж наверно узнает; и вот он «не сомневался в ее решении»!","And I told him everything, already standing with a hat in my hand. He didn't know anything. He quickly inquired about the details, mainly the time, place and degree of certainty. Of course, I did not hide the fact that, according to the stories, this happened immediately after his visit to Anna Andreevna yesterday. I cannot express what a painful impression this news made on him; his face was distorted, as if twisted, a crooked smile convulsively tightened his lips; in the end he turned terribly pale and fell into deep thought, lowering his eyes. I suddenly saw all too clearly that his vanity had been terribly affected by Anna Andreyevna's refusal yesterday. Perhaps too vividly, in his morbid mood, he imagined at that moment his yesterday's ridiculous and humiliating role in front of this girl, in whose consent, as it turned out now, he was so calmly sure all the time. And, finally, perhaps the thought that he had done such meanness in front of Liza and so for nothing! It is curious what these worldly dandies respect each other for, and on what grounds they can respect each other; after all, this prince could have assumed that Anna Andreevna already knew about his connection with Lisa, in fact with her sister, and if she did not know, then someday she would probably find out; and now he ""did not doubt her decision""!","And while standing there, ready to leave and holding my hat in my hand, I told him everything. He hadn't heard about it and asked me for more details, mainly about the time and place that the marriage had been settled. He also wanted to know how reliable the story was. I didn't conceal from him that it had been arranged almost immediately after his visit to Anna. It's hard to convey the painful impression the news made on him. His face became contorted and his lips froze in a twisted grin. Then he turned terribly pale, lowered his eyes, and immersed himself in deep thought. It became only too obvious to me what a blow to his pride Anna's engagement to another man was. Probably he felt he'd been humiliated and made ridiculous by a girl whose acceptance he'd taken for granted. And on top of that, he must have fully understood now how shabbily he had behaved toward Lisa, and all to no avail. Sometimes I wonder about the standards of behavior of this type of elegant young gentleman and about what his self-respect consists of. Surely it must have occurred to him that Anna might very well have been aware of his liaison with Lisa, since they were after all sisters, or, if she didn't yet know of it, she was very likely to find out about it sooner or later. But that did not seem to prevent him at all from taking for granted that she would accept his proposal!","And I told him all about it, standing, hat in hand. He knew nothing about it. He quickly asked questions, inquiring principally when and where the match had been arranged and how far the rumour was trustworthy. I did not, of course, conceal from him that it had been settled immediately after his visit to Anna Andreyevna. I cannot describe what a painful impression this news made upon him; his face worked and was almost contorted, and his lips twitched convulsively in a wry smile. At the end he turned horribly pale and sank into a reverie, with his eyes on the floor. I suddenly saw quite clearly that his vanity had been deeply wounded by Anna Andreyevna's refusal of him the day before. Perhaps in his morbid state of mind he realized only too vividly at that minute the absurd and humiliating part he had played the day before in the eyes of the young lady of whose acceptance, as it now appeared , he had all the time been so calmly confident. And worst of all, perhaps, was the thought that he had behaved so shabbily to Liza, and to no purpose! It would be interesting to know for what these foppish young snobs think well of one another, and on what grounds they can respect one another; this prince might well have supposed that Anna Andreyevna knew of his connection with Liza—in reality her sister—or if she did not actually know, that she would be certain to hear of it sooner or later; and yet he had ""had no doubt of her acceptance!"""
"Зверева (ему тоже было лет девятнадцать) я застал на дворе дома его тетки, у которой он временно проживал. Он только что пообедал и ходил по двору на ходулях; тотчас же сообщил мне, что Крафт приехал еще вчера и остановился на прежней квартире, тут же на Петербургской, и что он сам желает как можно скорее меня видеть, чтобы немедленно сообщить нечто нужное.","Zverev (he was also nineteen years old) I found in the courtyard of his aunt's house, with whom he temporarily lived. He had just had dinner and was walking about the yard on stilts; he immediately informed me that Kraft had arrived yesterday and was staying at his former apartment, right there on Peterburgskaya, and that he himself wanted to see me as soon as possible in order to immediately tell something necessary.","I found Zverev, who was about nineteen like me, in the yard of the house of the aunt with whom he lived. He had just finished his dinner and was walking about the yard on stilts. He informed me at once that Kraft had actually arrived the night before, that he lived in the same district not far away, and that he was very anxious to see me because he had an important message for me.","I found Efim (who was also nineteen) in the yard of his aunt's house, where he was staying for the time. He had just had dinner and was walking about the yard on stilts. He told me at once that Kraft had arrived the day before, and was staying at his old lodgings close by, and that he was anxious to see me as soon as possible, as he had something important to tell me."
"Младший, несмотря на то что она презрительно и брезгливо от него отмахивалась, как бы в самом деле боясь об него запачкаться (чего я никак не понимал, потому что он был такой хорошенький и оказался так хорошо одет, когда сбросил шубу), – младший настойчиво стал просить ее повязать своему длинному другу галстух, а предварительно повязать ему чистые воротнички из Ламбертовых. Та чуть не кинулась бить их от негодования при таком предложении, но Ламберт, вслушавшись, крикнул ей из-за ширм, чтоб она не задерживала и сделала, что просят, «а то не отстанут», прибавил он, и Альфонсина мигом схватила воротничок и стала повязывать длинному галстух, без малейшей уже брезгливости. Тот, точно так же как на лестнице, вытянул перед ней шею, пока та повязывала.","The younger, despite the fact that she contemptuously and disgustedly waved him off, as if really afraid of getting dirty on him (which I did not understand at all, because he was so pretty and turned out to be so well dressed when he threw off his fur coat), the younger one persistently began to ask her to tie a necktie to her long friend, and first to tie him clean collars from the Lambertovs. She almost rushed to beat them out of indignation at such a proposal, but Lambert, listening, shouted to her from behind the screens so that she would not delay and did what they asked, ""otherwise they will not leave behind,"" he added, and Alfonsina instantly grabbed her collar and began to tie a long tie, without the slightest disgust. He, just like on the stairs, stretched out his neck in front of her while she was tying.","The pretty boy, however, didn't seem in the least put off by her disgusted expression while she tried to wave him aside as if she were really afraid to be dirtied by touching him (it struck me as absurd because he was so neat and pretty and turned out to have an awfully elegant suit on when he threw off his topcoat). He went on insisting that she should fasten his friend's tie and that she should give him one of Lambert's clean shirt collars. She almost attacked him physically when he asked for the collar, but Lambert, who must have heard what was going on from behind the screen, shouted to her not to hold things up and to do what she was asked because otherwise ""they'll just keep pestering you."" So Alphonsine quickly produced one of Lambert's collars, fastened it around the tall fellow's neck, and proceeded to put on his tie without a trace of her recent revulsion. The fellow stretched out his neck just as he'd done on the landing and remained like that until she'd finished.","Though she warned him off with contempt and disgust, as though she were really afraid of being soiled by contact with him (which I could not at all understand because he was such a pretty fellow, and turned out to be just as well dressed when he took off his overcoat), the younger of the two men kept asking her to tie his tall friend's cravat for him, and to put him on one of Lambert's clean collars first. She was on the point of beating them in her indignation at such a suggestion, but Lambert overhearing, shouted to her behind the screen not to hinder them, but to do as they asked; ""they won't leave off if you don't,"" he added, and Alphonsine instantly produced a collar and began to fasten the tall man's cravat without the slightest sign of disinclination. The man stretched out his neck just as he had done on the stairs, while she tied his cravat."
"Он смотрел на меня во все глаза; я был одет хорошо, совсем не похож был на жида или перекупщика.","He looked at me with wide eyes; I was well dressed, I did not at all look like a Jew or a middleman.","He stared at me. I was dressed properly, not at all the way one imagines a secondhand dealer or a Jewish speculator.","He stared at me open-eyed. I was well dressed, not in the least like a Jew or a second-hand dealer."

"О, опять повторю: да простят мне, что я привожу весь этот тогдашний хмельной бред до последней строчки. Конечно, это только эссенция тогдашних мыслей, но, мне кажется, я этими самыми словами и говорил. Я должен был привести их, потому что я сел писать, чтоб судить себя. А что же судить, как не это? Разве в жизни может быть что-нибудь серьезнее? Вино же не оправдывало. In vino veritas.[117]","Oh, I repeat again: forgive me for citing all this drunken nonsense of that time to the last line. Of course, this is only the essence of the thoughts of that time, but it seems to me that I spoke with these very words. I had to bring them because I sat down to write to judge myself. And what to judge, if not this? Is there anything more serious in life? The wine didn't do the trick. In vino veritas.[117]","Let me apologize once more for reporting all my drunken thoughts in such detail. Of course, all this is only the essence of what was going through my mind then, but now I'm under the impression that I was talking to myself at the time in those exact words. I had to try to remember my exact words because my purpose in writing all this down in the first place was to enable people to judge me. But what would there be to judge me by if not this? As if there could be anything more important than this in life? The wine in me was no excuse—in vino Veritas.","Oh, I repeat again: I must be forgiven for recording all my drunken ravings at the time. Of course this is only the essence of what I thought then, but I fancy I used those very words. I was bound to record them because I have sat down to write in order to condemn myself. And what is to be condemned, if not that? Can there be anything graver in my life? Wine is no justification. In vino veritas."
"А кончилось все так, что и теперь там напреж всего вспоминают. Вдруг приезжает Максим Иванович к той самой вдове: нанимала на краю у мещанки в избушке. На сей раз уже во двор вошел; стал пред ней да и поклонился в землю. А та с тех разов больна была, еле двигалась. «Матушка, возопил, честная вдовица, выйди за меня, изверга, замуж, дай жить на свете!» Та глядит ни жива ни мертва. «Хочу, говорит, чтоб у нас еще мальчик родился, и ежели родится он, тогда, значит, тот мальчик простил нас обоих: и тебя и меня. Мне так мальчик велел». Видит она, что не в уме человек, а как бы в исступлении, да все же не утерпела.","And it all ended in such a way that even now they remember everything there. Suddenly, Maxim Ivanovich comes to the same widow: she hired on the edge of a petty-bourgeois woman in a hut. This time he entered the yard; stood before her and bowed to the ground. And she has been sick since then, she could hardly move. “Mother, cried out, honest widow, marry me, a monster, marry me, let me live in the world!” She looks neither alive nor dead. “I want, he says, that we have another boy born, and if he is born, then that boy has forgiven both of us: both you and me. The boy told me so."" She sees that the man is not in his mind, but as if in a frenzy, but still she could not stand it.","As to Maxim, everyone in those parts still remembers how he ended up. One day he drove over to the place where the widow lived—a hut on the edge of town where she rented a room. This time he didn't stay in the carriage. He got down and walked into the yard. He saw the woman sitting there, planted himself in front of her, and bowed down to the ground. You see, she'd been ill ever since that other time, so she couldn't move around much. ""Good lady,"" he said, ""honest widow! Marry me, monster that I am, marry me so I can go on living! ""I want us to have a baby boy together and if we succeed that will mean that the boy has forgiven us both, you and me. For that's what the boy told me."" She must've seen that the man was not in his right mind, that he was in a sort of frenzy, but she couldn't hold herself back from saying:","And it all ended so that even now they remember it everywhere there. Maxim Ivanovitch suddenly drives up to the same widow. She lodged at the edge of the town in a working-woman's hut; he stood before her and bowed down to the ground. And she had been ill ever since that time and could scarcely move. ""Good mother,"" he wailed, ""honest widow, marry me, monster as I am. Let me live again!"" She looks at him more dead than alive. ""I want us to have another boy,"" said he. ""And if he is born, it will mean that that boy has forgiven us both, both you and me. For so the boy has bidden me."" She saw the man was out of his mind, and in a frenzy, but she could not refrain."
"– Как, она встретила вас в кухне? – вскричал я, отшатнувшись от изумления.","How did she meet you in the kitchen?

Я жениться хочу – это дело другое, но мне не надобен капитал, я презираю капитал. Я сам не возьму, если б она давала мне свой капитал на коленях… А жениться, жениться, это – дело другое. И знаешь, это ты хорошо сказал, чтобы в кулаке держать. Любить, страстно любить, со всем великодушием, какое в мужчине и какого никогда не может быть в женщине, но и деспотировать – это хорошо.

Because a woman likes to be bullied. You understand women, Lambert, although you're remarkably stupid in every other respect. And you know what —you're not really quite as repulsive a character as you may seem at first glance. You're really quite a simple soul. I'm sort of fond of you, Lambert. But why are you such a crook?

"Я знаю из нескольких рук положительно, что мать моя красавицей не была, хотя тогдашнего портрета ее, который где-то есть, я не видал. С первого взгляда в нее влюбиться, стало быть, нельзя было. Для простого «развлечения» Версилов мог выбрать другую, и такая там была, да еще незамужняя, Анфиса Константиновна Сапожкова, сенная девушка. А человеку, который приехал с «Антоном Горемыкой», разрушать, на основании помещичьего права, святость брака, хотя и своего дворового, было бы очень зазорно перед самим собою, потому что, повторяю, про этого «Антона Горемыку» он еще не далее как несколько месяцев тому назад, то есть двадцать лет спустя, говорил чрезвычайно серьезно. Так ведь у Антона только лошадь увели, а тут жену! Произошло, значит, что-то особенное, отчего и проиграла mademoiselle Сапожкова (по-моему, выиграла). Я приставал к нему раз-другой прошлого года, когда можно было с ним разговаривать (потому что не всегда можно было с ним разговаривать), со всеми этими вопросами и заметил, что он, несмотря на всю свою светскость и двадцатилетнее расстояние, как-то чрезвычайно кривился. Но я настоял. По крайней мере с тем видом светской брезгливости, которую он неоднократно себе позволял со мною, он, я помню, однажды промямлил как-то странно: что мать моя была одна такая особа из незащищенных, которую не то что полюбишь, – напротив, вовсе нет, – а как-то вдруг почему-то пожалеешь, за кротость, что ли, впрочем, за что? – это всегда никому не известно, но пожалеешь надолго; пожалеешь и привяжешься… «Одним словом, мой милый, иногда бывает так, что и не отвяжешься». Вот что он сказал мне; и если это действительно было так, то я принужден почесть его вовсе не таким тогдашним глупым щенком, каким он сам себя для того времени аттестует. Это-то мне и надо было.","I know positively from several hands that my mother was not a beauty, although I did not see her then portrait, which is somewhere. It was impossible to fall in love with her at first sight. For simple ""entertainment"" Versilov could have chosen another, and there was such an one, and even an unmarried one, Anfisa Konstantinovna Sapozhkova, a hay girl. And for a man who came with ""Anton Goremyka"" to destroy, on the basis of landowner's right, the sanctity of marriage, even if it was his own, it would be very shameful in front of himself, because, I repeat, about this ""Anton Goremyka"" he is no more than a few months ago, that is, twenty years later, he spoke extremely seriously. So after all, only Anton's horse was taken away, and then his wife! It means that something special happened, which is why Mademoiselle Sapozhkova lost (in my opinion, she won). I pestered him once or twice last year, when it was possible to talk to him (because it was not always possible to talk to him), with all these questions and noticed that, despite all his secularism and twenty years of distance, somehow wriggled extremely. But I insisted. At least with that kind of secular disgust that he repeatedly allowed himself with me, he, I remember, once mumbled in a strange way: that my mother was one such person from the unprotected, whom you not only love, - on the contrary, not at all - but somehow suddenly for some reason you regret it, for meekness, or what, however, for what? - it is always unknown to anyone, but you will regret it for a long time; you will regret it and get attached ... “In a word, my dear, sometimes it happens that you won’t get rid of it.” That's what he told me; and if this was really so, then I am compelled to consider him not at all such a stupid puppy of that time as he certifies himself for that time. This is what I needed.","I definitely know from various sources that my mother was no raving beauty, although I've never seen the portrait which was made of her at that age and which still exists. Therefore it was impossible to fall in love with her at first sight. If he'd just wanted a little fun, Versilov could've picked someone else, an available unmarried girl like the housemaid Anfisa Sapozhkov, for instance. But for a man who had arrived carrying a copy of Poor Anton, it was quite unbecoming to use his droit de seigneur to violate the sanctity of marriage, even of a mere serf, because, as I said, he still spoke of that book with great respect only a few months ago (that is, twenty years later). Why, they only took Anton's horse away from him, while in this case it was the fellow's wife! So something special must have happened and Miss Sapozhkov wound up the loser (or, in my opinion, the winner). Last year, on a couple of occasions when it was possible to talk to him (for it wasn't always possible), I went all out at him with those questions. I noticed that, for all his urbane polish and the twenty-year distance that separated us from the events, he was extremely reticent and evasive. But I insisted. At one point, although he still looked at me with that expression of worldly superciliousness I was so familiar with, he mumbled in a voice that struck me as strange something to the effect that my mother was one of those helpless creatures whom a man would not necessarily love—not at all, in fact—but for whom he could suddenly become sorry, because of her meekness or something like that. . . . And he is sorry for her for a long time and then he gets attached to her ""so that it becomes impossible for him to break it off, my boy, if you see what I mean. . . . "" That's what he told me and, if it's true, I cannot agree that he was at the time just a ""stupid young dog,"" as he tried to describe himself as a young man. And that's just what I was after.","I know from several sources that my mother was by no means a beauty, though I have never seen the portrait of her at that age which is in existence. So it was impossible to have fallen in love with her at first sight. Simply to ""amuse himself "" Versilov might have pitched on some one else, and there was some one else in the house, an unmarried girl too, Anfisa Konstantinovna Sapozhkov, a housemaid. To a man who had brought ""Poor Anton"" with him to the country it must have seemed shameful to take advantage of his seignorial rights to violate the sanctity of a marriage, even that of his serf, for I repeat, he spoke with extreme seriousness of this ""Poor Anton"" only a few months ago, that is, twenty years after the event. Why, ""Poor Anton"" only had his horse taken from him, but this was a wife! So there must have been something peculiar in this case, and Mlle. Sapozhkov was the loser by it (or rather, I should say, the gainer). I attacked him with all these questions once or twice last year when it was possible to talk to him (for it wasn't always possible to talk to him). And, in spite of all his society polish and the lapse of twenty years, I noticed that he winced. But I persisted. On one occasion, anyway, although he maintained the air of worldly superciliousness which he invariably thought fit to assume with me, he muttered strangely that my mother was one of those ""defenceless"" people whom one does not fall in love with—quite the contrary, in fact—but whom one suddenly pities for their gentleness, perhaps, though one cannot tell what for. That no one ever knows, but one goes on pitying them, one pities them and grows fond of them. "" In fact, my dear boy, there are cases when one can't shake it off. "" That was what he told me.

"Версилов будто бы успел внушить по-своему, тонко и неотразимо, молодой особе, что Катерина Николавна оттого не соглашается, что влюблена в него сама и уже давно мучит его ревностью, преследует его, интригует, объяснилась уже ему, и теперь готова сжечь его за то, что он полюбил другую; одним словом, что-то в этом роде. Сквернее всего тут то, что он будто бы «намекнул» об этом и отцу, мужу «неверной» жены, объясняя, что князь был только развлечением. Разумеется, в семействе начался целый ад. По иным вариантам, Катерина Николавна ужасно любила свою падчерицу и теперь, как оклеветанная перед нею, была в отчаянии, не говоря уже об отношениях к больному мужу. И что же, рядом с этим существует другой вариант, которому, к печали моей, вполне верил и Крафт и которому я и сам верил (обо всем этом я уже слышал). Утверждали (Андроников, говорят, слышал от самой Катерины Николавны), что, напротив, Версилов, прежде еще, то есть до начала чувств молодой девицы, предлагал свою любовь Катерине Николавне; что та, бывшая его другом, даже экзальтированная им некоторое время, но постоянно ему не верившая и противоречившая, встретила это объяснение Версилова с чрезвычайною ненавистью и ядовито осмеяла его. Выгнала же его формально от себя за то, что тот предложил ей прямо стать его женой ввиду близкого предполагаемого второго удара мужа. Таким образом, Катерина Николавна должна была почувствовать особенную ненависть к Версилову, когда увидела потом, что он так открыто ищет уже руки ее падчерицы. Марья Ивановна, передавая все это мне в Москве, верила и тому и другому варианту, то есть всему вместе: она именно утверждала, что все это могло произойти совместно, что это вроде la haine dans l'amour,[32] оскорбленной любовной гордости с обеих сторон и т. д., и т. д., одним словом, что-то вроде какой-то тончайшей романической путаницы, недостойной всякого серьезного и здравомыслящего человека и, вдобавок, с подлостью. Но Марья Ивановна была и сама нашпигована романами с детства и читала их день и ночь, несмотря на прекрасный характер. В результате выставлялась очевидная подлость Версилова, ложь и интрига, что-то черное и гадкое, тем более что кончилось действительно трагически: бедная воспламененная девушка отравилась, говорят, фосфорными спичками; впрочем, я даже и теперь не знаю, верен ли этот последний слух; по крайней мере его всеми силами постарались замять. Девица была больна всего две недели и умерла. Спички остались, таким образом, под сомнением, но Крафт и им твердо верил. Затем умер вскорости и отец девицы, говорят, от горести, которая и вызвала второй удар, однако не раньше как через три месяца. Но после похорон девицы молодой князь Сокольский, возвратившийся из Парижа в Эмс, дал Версилову пощечину публично в саду и тот не ответил вызовом; напротив, на другой же день явился на променаде как ни в чем не бывало. Тут-то все от него и отвернулись, в Петербурге тоже. Версилов хоть и продолжал некоторое знакомство, но совсем в другом кругу. Из светского его знакомства все его обвинили, хотя, впрочем, мало кто знал обо всех подробностях; знали только нечто о романической смерти молодой особы и о пощечине. По возможности полные сведения имели только два-три лица; более всех знал покойный Андроников, имея уже давно деловые сношения с Ахмаковыми и особенно с Катериной Николавной по одному случаю. Но он хранил все эти секреты даже от семейства своего, а открыл лишь нечто Крафту и Марье Ивановне, да и то вследствие необходимости.","Versilov seemed to have succeeded in impressing, in his own way, subtly and irresistibly, on the young lady that Katerina Nikolaevna did not agree because she herself was in love with him and had long been tormenting him with jealousy, pursuing him, intriguing, had already explained to him, and now she was ready to burn him for that he fell in love with another; in a word, something like that. The worst thing here is that he allegedly “hinted” about this to his father, the husband of his “unfaithful” wife, explaining that the prince was only entertainment. Of course, all hell broke loose in the family. According to other options, Katerina Nikolaevna loved her stepdaughter terribly and now, as if slandered before her, was in despair, not to mention her relationship with her sick husband. And well, next to this there is another option, which, to my sadness, Kraft fully believed and which I myself believed (I have already heard about all this). They asserted (Andronikov, they say, heard from Katerina Nikolaevna herself) that, on the contrary, Versilov, before even, that is, before the beginning of the young girl's feelings, offered his love to Katerina Nikolaevna; that she, who was his friend, even exalted by him for some time, but constantly disbelieving and contradicting him, met this explanation of Versilov with extreme hatred and venomously ridiculed him. She formally expelled him from herself because he offered her to directly become his wife in view of the close alleged second blow of her husband. Thus, Katerina Nikolaevna must have felt a special hatred for Versilov when she later saw that he was already so openly seeking the hand of her stepdaughter. Marya Ivanovna, passing all this on to me in Moscow, believed both options, that is, everything together: she was precisely asserting that all this could happen together, that it was like la haine dans l'amour, [32] offended love pride with both sides, etc., etc., in a word, something like some kind of the most subtle romantic confusion, unworthy of any serious and sane person and, in addition, with meanness. But Marya Ivanovna herself was stuffed with novels from childhood and read them day and night, in spite of her excellent character. As a result, Versilov's obvious meanness, lies and intrigue, something black and nasty, were exposed, all the more so because it ended really tragically: the poor, inflamed girl was poisoned, they say, with phosphorus matches; however, even now I do not know whether this last rumor is true; at least they did their best to hush it up. The girl was sick for only two weeks and died. The matches were thus left in doubt, but Kraft firmly believed them too. Then the girl's father died soon after, they say, from grief, which caused a second blow, but not earlier than three months later. But after the funeral of the girl, the young Prince Sokolsky, who had returned from Paris to Ems, slapped Versilov publicly in the garden, and he did not answer the challenge; on the contrary, the very next day he appeared on the promenade as if nothing had happened. It was then that everyone turned away from him, in St. Petersburg too. Versilov, although he continued some acquaintance, but in a completely different circle. From his secular acquaintance, everyone accused him, although, however, few people knew about all the details; they only knew something about the young lady's romantic death and the slap in the face. If possible, only two or three persons had complete information; The late Andronikov knew best of all, having long business relations with the Akhmakovs and especially with Katerina Nikolaevna on one occasion. But he kept all these secrets even from his family, and revealed only something to Kraft and Marya Ivanovna, and even then out of necessity.","Versilov, ""in his usual way,"" may have subtly and effectively insinuated to the young girl that Katerina Akhmakov refused to consent to the marriage because she herself was in love with him, had pestered him with her jealousy for a long time, pursued him, tried to ensnare him, had declared her love to him and, now that she knew he loved another woman, was bent on destroying him, and so on in the same vein. Even worse, Versilov may have ""hinted"" something about Katerina's love for him to the general, the ""poor"" husband, explaining that her interest in the young Prince Sokolsky had been just a fleeting fancy compared with this. It goes without saying that the Akhmakovs' family life became hell. According to some versions of the story, what depressed Katerina even more than the resulting hostility of her sick husband was being disgraced in the eyes of her stepdaughter, to whom she had been so deeply attached. But there is, alas, another version—one, indeed, that Kraft accepted, that I had heard before, and that I believed to be true too. It was said—and Andronikov is supposed to have heard this from Katerina's own mouth—that, when he had learned of the young girl's feelings for him, Versilov himself had offered his love to the stepmother. And Katerina, who had been carried away by him at one time and used to be his friend but then had come to distrust him and argued with him constantly, had met his declaration of love with venomous scorn and an outburst of hatred. Nevertheless, after General Akhmakov had suffered a second stroke, Versilov had openly proposed to Katerina that she marry him , whereupon she had asked him to leave her house and never come back. This would explain Katerina's new outburst of hatred for the man when he openly began trying to marry her stepdaughter. Maria, who told me all this in Moscow, believed both versions. She asserted that they both could be true at once, that this was something called la haine dans I'amour, a mutual case of wounded love pride, etc., etc.—some oversubtle romantic nonsense unworthy of any sane and responsible person, spiked, moreover, with a goodly amount of villainy. But then dear old Maria was herself stuffed with romances that she had been reading day and night ever since her girlhood, although by nature she was an excellent person. One was thus left with a general impression of Versilov as villainous, lying, scheming, with something about him that was quite horrible and unmentionable, an impression that was further strengthened by the tragic turn of events: the poor girl, whose feelings he had set afire, poisoned herself, they say by swallowing the phosphorous heads of matches, although to this day I'm not sure whether to believe that detail since they tried to hush things up as much as possible. The girl died after an illness that lasted a fortnight. And so, while it's debatable whether matches were used in this case, Kraft firmly believed they were. The general died soon after his daughter; they even say that it was his grief over her death that triggered his last stroke, which came three months later. It was after the girl's funeral that the young Prince Sergei Sokolsky, who had in the meantime returned to Ems from Paris, met Versilov in the public gardens and slapped his face in the presence of many people. Versilov did nothing about it. Indeed, the following day he reappeared on the promenade as if nothing had happened. And this was what made everyone turn their backs on him, in Ems as well as in Petersburg. Although Versilov still saw some people, they certainly did not belong to his former world. His old social acquaintances placed all the blame on him, even though they didn't know exactly what had happened and were aware only of a young girl's romantic love and of the slap. Only two or three people had a more or less complete picture of the whole business. The best informed had been the late Andronikov who had had long-standing business relations with the Akhmakovs and, especially on one particular occasion, with Katerina herself. But he had kept most of these secrets even from his family, confiding to his niece Maria and to Kraft only as much as he thought necessary.","He thought Versilov had succeeded, IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC WAY, in subtly suggesting to the young person that the reason Katerina Nikolaevna would not agree was that she was in love with him herself, and had been for a long time past worrying him with her jealousy, pursuing him and intriguing; that she had declared her feeling to him and was now ready to horsewhip him for loving some one else: something of that sort, anyway. Worst of all, that he had ""hinted"" this to the girl's father, the husband of the ""unfaithful"" wife, explaining that the prince had only been a passing amusement. The house, of course, began to be a perfect hell. In some versions of the story Katerina Nikolaevna was devoted to her stepdaughter and now was in despair at being calumniated to her, to say nothing of her relations with her invalid husband. And, what is more, there existed another version, which, to my grief, I found Kraft fully believed, and therefore I believed myself (of all this I had heard already). It was maintained (Andronikov, it was said, had heard it from Katerina Nikolaevna herself) that, on the contrary, Versilov had in the past, before his feeling for the girl, made love to Katerina Nikolaevna; that though she had been his friend and had been for a time carried away by his religious exaltation, yet she had constantly opposed and mistrusted him, and that she had met Versilov's declaration with deep resentment and had ridiculed him vindictively; that she had formally dismissed him for having openly suggested that she should become his wife as her husband was expected to have a second attack very shortly. On this theory Katerina Nikolaevna must have felt a peculiar hatred for Versilov when she saw him afterwards so openly trying to win her stepdaughter's hand. Marie Ivanovna, who told me all this in Moscow, believed in both versions—both together, that is; she maintained that there was nothing inconsistent in all this, that it was something in the style of la haine dans l'amour, of the wounded pride of love on both sides, etc. etc.—something, in fact, like a very subtle, intricate romance, quite out of keeping with any serious and common-sense man and, moreover, with an element of nastiness in it. But Marie Ivanovna, in spite of her estimable character, had been from childhood upwards saturated with sentiment, from the novels which she read day and night. The sequel exhibited Versilov's evident baseness, his lying and intriguing, something dark and loathsome in him, the more so as the affair had a tragic ending. The poor infatuated girl poisoned herself, they say, by means of phosphorus matches, though even now I don't know whether to believe that last detail. They did their utmost to hush it up, anyway. The young lady was ill for a fortnight and then died. So the matches remained an open question, but Kraft firmly believed in them. Shortly afterwards the young lady's father died too—it was said from his grief, which brought on a second stroke, though this did not occur till three months later. But after the young lady's funeral the young Prince Sokolsky, who had returned to Ems from Paris, gave Versilov a slap in the face in a public garden, and the latter had not replied with a challenge but had, on the contrary, showed himself next day on the promenade as though nothing had happened. Then every one turned against him, in Petersburg as well. Though Versilov kept up with some acquaintances, they were quite in a different circle. All his aristocratic friends blamed him, though, as a fact, scarcely anyone knew the details; they only knew something of the young lady's romantic death and the slap in the face. Only two or three persons knew the story fully, so far as that was possible. The one who had known most of all was the deceased, Andronikov, who had for many years had business relations with the Ahmakovs, and had had to do with Katerina Nikolaevna particularly in one case. But he kept all these secrets even from his own family and had only told part of the story to Kraft and Marie Ivanovna, and that from necessity."

"От князя, оставив его тогда с Лизою, я, около часу пополудни, заехал на прежнюю мою квартиру. Я забыл сказать, что день был сырой, тусклый, с начинавшеюся оттепелью и с теплым ветром, способным расстроить нервы даже у слона. Хозяин встретил меня обрадовавшись, заметавшись и закидавшись, чего я страх не люблю именно в такие минуты. Я обошелся сухо и прямо прошел к себе, но он последовал за мной, и хоть не смел расспрашивать, но любопытство так и сияло в глазах его, притом смотрел как уже имеющий даже какое-то право быть любопытным. Я должен был обойтись вежливо для своей же выгоды; но хотя мне слишком необходимо было кое-что узнать (и я знал, что узнаю), но все же было противно начать расспросы. Я осведомился о здоровье жены его, и мы сходили к ней. Та встретила меня хоть и внимательно, но с чрезвычайно деловым и неразговорчивым видом; это меня несколько примирило. Короче, я узнал в тот раз весьма чудные вещи.","From the prince, leaving him then with Liza, I, at about one o'clock in the afternoon, drove to my former apartment. I forgot to say that the day was damp, dull, with the beginning of a thaw and with a warm wind capable of upsetting the nerves even of an elephant. The owner greeted me delighted, rushing about and throwing himself, which I don’t like fear just at such moments. I behaved stiffly and went straight to my room, but he followed me, and although he did not dare to question, curiosity shone in his eyes, moreover, he looked as if he already had some right to be curious. I had to be polite for my own benefit; but although it was too necessary for me to find out something (and I knew that I would find out), it was still disgusting to start inquiring. I inquired about the health of his wife, and we went to her. She met me, though attentively, but with an extremely businesslike and uncommunicative air; this reconciled me somewhat. In short, I learned at that time very wonderful things.","I left Prince Sergei with Lisa and went over to my former lodgings where I arrived around one o'clock. I should have mentioned that it was a dull, damp day with a warmish wind bringing on a thaw, the kind of a day that could cause a nervous upset even in an elephant. The landlord was so pleased to see me that he started to fuss and rush all over the place like a madman, which is something I've always detested, especially at moments such as this. I was icily reserved with him and walked straight to my room. But that still wasn't enough to discourage him from following me and, although he didn't dare ask me any questions directly, he kept looking at me with insatiable curiosity. I remembered that it was in my own interest to treat him more or less civilly: there was something I had to find out from him (and I knew I would find it out). Nevertheless, I felt it demeaning to start questioning him. So I first inquired about his wife's health and we went to pay her a visit. She received me politely but was very matter-of-fact and not in the least chatty, which reconciled me somewhat to the place. . . . Well, in the end, I did get some very interesting information.","Leaving Prince Sergay with Liza I went off about one o'clock to my old lodging. I forgot to say that it was a dull, damp day, with a thaw beginning, and a warm wind that would upset the nerves of an elephant. The master of the house met me with a great display of delight, and a great deal of fuss and bustle, which I particularly dislike, especially at such moments. I received this drily, and went straight to my room, but he followed me, and though he did not venture to question me, yet his face was beaming with curiosity, and at the same time he looked as though he had a right to be curious. I had to behave politely for my own sake; but though it was so essential to me to find out something (and I knew I should learn it) , I yet felt it revolting to begin cross-examining him. I inquired after the health of his wife, and we went in to see her. The latter met me deferentially indeed, but with a businesslike and taciturn manner; this to some extent softened my heart. To be brief, I learned on this occasion some very wonderful things."

"Я вдруг очутился, с каким-то великим и гордым намерением в сердце, в большой и высокой комнате; но не у Татьяны Павловны: я очень хорошо помню комнату; замечаю это, забегая вперед. Но хотя я и один, но беспрерывно чувствую, с беспокойством и мукой, что я совсем не один, что меня ждут и что ждут от меня чего-то. Где-то за дверями сидят люди и ждут того, что я сделаю. Ощущение нестерпимое: «О, если б я был один!» И вдруг входит она. Она смотрит робко, она ужасно боится, она засматривает в мои глаза. В руках моих документ. Она улыбается, чтоб пленить меня, она ластится ко мне; мне жалко, но я начинаю чувствовать отвращение. Вдруг она закрывает лицо руками. Я бросаю «документ» на стол в невыразимом презрении: «Не просите, нате, мне от вас ничего не надо! Мщу за все мое поругание презрением!» Я выхожу из комнаты, захлебываясь от непомерной гордости. Но в дверях, в темноте, схватывает меня Ламберт: «Духгак, духгак! – шепчет он, изо всех сил удерживая меня за руку, – она на Васильевском острове благородный пансион для девчонок должна открывать» (NB то есть чтоб прокормиться, если отец, узнав от меня про документ, лишит ее наследства и прогонит из дому. Я вписываю слова Ламберта буквально, как приснились).","I suddenly found myself, with some great and proud intention in my heart, in a large and high room; but not at Tatyana Pavlovna's: I remember the room very well; I notice this as I jump ahead. But although I am alone, I constantly feel, with anxiety and anguish, that I am not at all alone, that they are waiting for me and that they are waiting for something from me. Somewhere behind the doors people are sitting and waiting for what I will do. The feeling is unbearable: ""Oh, if I were alone!"" And suddenly she enters. She looks timidly, she is terribly afraid, she looks into my eyes. I have a document in my hands. She smiles to captivate me, she caresses me; I'm sorry, but I'm starting to feel disgusted. Suddenly she covers her face with her hands. I throw the “document” on the table in inexpressible contempt: “Don’t ask, here, I don’t need anything from you! I avenge all my reproach with contempt! I leave the room, choking with exorbitant pride. But at the door, in the dark, Lambert grabs me: “Duhgak, duggak! - he whispers, holding my hand with all his might, - she must open a noble boarding school for girls on Vasilyevsky Island ”(NB, that is, to feed herself if her father, having learned from me about the document, deprives her of her inheritance and drives her out of the house. I enter Lambert's words literally, as dreamed).","I find myself, full of noble and proud resolve, in a high-ceilinged room. I remember that room clearly and must emphasize that it was not one of Mrs. Prutkov's rooms, for this is important in view of what follows. I have a nagging, uneasy, and alarming feeling that I'm not alone, that I'm being watched, that I'm expected to do something. Somewhere behind the door they are waiting to see what I'll do. It's an unbearable sensation. "" Oh,"" I think, ""if only I were here alone!"" Then suddenly Katerina appears. She looks at me timidly; she's frightened; she searches my eyes. The document is in my hand. She smiles, she tries to overwhelm me with her charm; she puts on caressing airs. I feel sorry for her, but a feeling of disgust rises up inside me. She covers her face with her hands. I toss the document on the table and say with infinite scorn: ""No need for all that—there's nothing I want from you. I'm paying you back for all your insults with contempt. "" I walk out of the room, wallowing in tremendous pride. But in the doorway I'm suddenly grabbed by Lambert. "" You moron, moron!"" he whispers, rolling his French r's in his throat and holding me tightly by the arm, ""she's about to open a boarding school for young ladies on Vas-ilievsky Island, for she'll have to earn her living when her father hears about the document, disinherits her, and kicks her out of his house."" (I'm writing down verbatim the words Lambert uttered in my dream.)","I suddenly found myself with my heart full of a grand and proud design, in a large lofty room; I remember the room very well , it was not at Tatyana Pavlovna's, I may observe, anticipating events.

"– Конечно, потому что и вас это так же волновало, а я вам давно призналась: я русская и Россию люблю. Вы помните, мы все с вами читали «факты», как вы это называли (улыбнулась она). Вы хоть и очень часто бываете какой-то… странный, но вы иногда так оживлялись, что всегда умели сказать меткое слово, и интересовались именно тем, что меня интересовало. Когда вы бываете «студентом», вы, право, бываете милы и оригинальны. Вот другие роли вам, кажется, мало идут, – прибавила она с прелестной, хитрой усмешкой. – Вы помните, мы иногда по целым часам говорили про одни только цифры, считали и примеривали, заботились о том, сколько школ у нас, куда направляется просвещение. Мы считали убийства и уголовные дела, сравнивали с хорошими известиями… хотелось узнать, куда это все стремится и что с нами самими, наконец, будет. Я в вас встретила искренность. В свете с нами, с женщинами, так никогда не говорят. Я на прошлой неделе заговорила было с князем – вым о Бисмарке, потому что очень интересовалась, а сама не умела решить, и вообразите, он сел подле и начал мне рассказывать, даже очень подробно, но все с какой-то иронией и с тою именно нестерпимою для меня снисходительностью, с которою обыкновенно говорят «великие мужи» с нами, женщинами, если те сунутся «не в свое дело»… А помните, как мы о Бисмарке с вами чуть не поссорились? Вы мне доказывали, что у вас есть своя идея «гораздо почище» Бисмарковой, – засмеялась вдруг она. – Я в жизни встретила лишь двух людей, которые со мной говорили вполне серьезно: покойного мужа, очень, очень умного и… бла-го-родного человека, – произнесла она внушительно, – и еще – вы сами знаете кого…","- Of course, because you were just as worried, and I confessed to you a long time ago: I am Russian and I love Russia. You remember, we all read “facts”, as you called it (she smiled). Although you are very often some kind of ... strange, you sometimes became so animated that you always knew how to say a well-aimed word, and were interested in exactly what interested me. When you are a ""student"" you are really nice and original. Other roles, it seems, do not suit you well, ”she added with a charming, sly smile. – Do you remember, sometimes we talked for whole hours about nothing but numbers, counted and tried on, cared about how many schools we have, where education is directed. We counted murders and criminal cases, compared them with good news… I wanted to know where it all aspires to and what will finally happen to us ourselves. I found sincerity in you. In the world with us, with women, they never say that. Last week I started talking to the prince about Bismarck, because I was very interested, but I myself did not know how to decide, and imagine, he sat down beside me and began to tell me, even in great detail, but all with some kind of irony and with that particular intolerable condescension for me, with which ""great men"" usually speak to us women, if they poke their noses ""into their own business"" ... Do you remember how we almost quarreled about Bismarck? You proved to me that you have your own idea “much cleaner” than Bismarck's,” she suddenly laughed. “I met only two people in my life who spoke to me quite seriously: my late husband, a very, very smart and ... noble person,” she said impressively, “and also - you yourself know who ...","""Of course not, because you too were worried about what was going on. . . . Yes, as I said to you long ago, I'm a true Russian and I love this country. Remember how we used to look together for what you referred to as facts? And although at times you can be a little peculiar, if I may say so, on those occasions you became quite perspicacious; your remarks were very much to the point and you happened to be interested in just the things that interested me most. You know, whenever you assume the role of 'student,' you become extremely charming and original, while many of your other roles don't suit you well at all!"" Again that irresistible subtle smile appeared on her lips. "" Remember how sometimes we spent hours on end discussing bare statistics, such as how many schools we have and the prospects of education in our country; then we counted murders and other criminal offenses and tried to compare these figures with actual news items. We wanted to know where all this was leading and what would happen in the future. I found you sincere. This was not the sort of conversation gentlemen have with ladies in our society. Last week, for instance, I tried to ask Prince ***ov what he thought of Bismarck because I was very puzzled by Bismarck's moves and couldn't make out on my own what he was after. So Prince *** ov sat down next to me and started to explain the situation in great detail in an ironic and unbearably condescending tone, the tone a wise statesman might use to answer a silly woman who is prying into affairs that should not concern her. But remember how you and I almost quarreled about that same Bismarck! And then you even told me that you had an 'idea' of your own that went quite beyond Bismarck's!"" She laughed. ""There have been only two people who talked to me with complete seriousness before: my late husband, who was an extremely intelligent and . . . and extremely high-minded man,"" she said emphatically, ""and after him .","""Of course not, for you, too, were excited over them, and I confessed, too, long ago, that I am Russian, and love Russia. You remember we always read 'facts' as you called them"" (she smiled). ""Though you are at times somewhat … strange, yet sometimes you grew so eager and would say such good things, and you were interested just in what I was interested in. When you are a 'student' you are charming and original. Nothing else suits you so well,"" she added, with a sly and charming smile. ""Do you remember we sometimes talked for hours about nothing but figures, reckoned and compared, and took trouble to find out how many schools there are in Russia, and in what direction progress is being made?

In you I found sincerity. In our world men never talk like that to us, to women. Last week I was talking to Prince X. about Bismarck, for I was very much interested, and could not make up my mind about him, and only fancy , he sat down beside me and began telling me about him very fully, indeed, but always with a sort of irony, and that patronizing condescension which I always find so insufferable, and which is so common in 'great men' when they talk to us women if we meddle with 'subjects beyond our sphere.' … Do you remember that we almost had a quarrel, you and I, over Bismarck? You showed me that you had ideas of your own 'far more definite' than Bismarck's,"" she laughed suddenly. ""I have only met two people in my whole life who talked to me quite seriously; my husband, a very, very intelligent and hon-our-able man,"" she pronounced the words impressively, ""and you know whom… ."""

"Я остался один; сначала мне было странно, потом обидно, а потом я ясно увидел, что я виноват. Впрочем, я не знал, в чем, собственно, я виноват, а только что-то почувствовал. Я сидел у окна и ждал. Прождав минут десять, я тоже взял шляпу и пошел наверх, в мою бывшую светелку. Я знал, что они там, то есть мама и Лиза, и что Татьяна Павловна уже ушла. Так я их и нашел обеих вместе на моем диване, об чем-то шептавшихся. При моем появлении обе тотчас же перестали шептаться. К удивлению моему, они на меня не сердились; мама по крайней мере мне улыбнулась.","I was left alone; At first I felt strange, then offended, and then I clearly saw that I was to blame. However, I did not know what, in fact, I was to blame, but only felt something. I sat by the window and waited. After waiting for about ten minutes, I also took my hat and went upstairs to my former room. I knew that they were there, that is, mother and Liza, and that Tatyana Pavlovna had already left. So I found them both together on my sofa, whispering about something. When I appeared, both of them immediately stopped whispering. To my surprise, they were not angry with me; Mom at least smiled at me.","So I remained all alone. At first I was rather bewildered; then I became filled with resentment, but in the end I felt that it had been all my fault. I sat by the window and waited.

And, indeed, Lisa and Mother were sitting on my old sofa and talking in whispers. They immediately became silent when they saw me. To my surprise they didn't seem angry with me any longer. Mother even smiled at me.","I remained alone; at first I felt bewildered, then I felt resentful, but afterwards I saw clearly that I was to blame.

"– Ну, довольно же, довольно! – восклицал я, – я не протестую, берите! Князь… где же князь и Дарзан? Ушли?

"– Еще как! И знаешь, мой друг, в этом пункте даже совсем удивил меня. Трех тысяч у меня тогда в кармане, разумеется, не случилось, но я достал семьсот рублей и вручил ему их на первый случай, и что же? Он две тысячи триста остальных стребовал же с меня, в виде заемного письма, для верности, на имя одного купца. Потом, через два года, он по этому письму стребовал с меня уже деньги судом и с процентами, так что меня опять удивил, тем более что буквально пошел сбирать на построение Божьего храма, и с тех пор вот уже двадцать лет скитается. Не понимаю, зачем страннику столько собственных денег… деньги такая светская вещь… Я, конечно, предлагал их в ту минуту искренно и, так сказать, с первым пылом, но потом, по прошествии столь многих минут, я, естественно, мог одуматься… и рассчитывал, что он по крайней мере меня пощадит… или, так сказать, нас пощадит, нас с нею, подождет хоть по крайней мере. Однако даже не подождал…","- And how! And you know, my friend, at this point he even completely surprised me. Of course, I didn’t have three thousand in my pocket then, but I took out seven hundred rubles and handed them to him on the first occasion, and what then?

Then, two years later, according to this letter, he demanded money from me by the court and with interest, so he surprised me again, especially since he literally went to collect for the construction of God's temple, and since then he has been wandering for twenty years. I don’t understand why a wanderer needs so much money of his own... money is such a worldly thing... Of course, I offered it at that moment sincerely and, so to speak, with the first ardor, but then, after so many minutes had passed, I could naturally change my mind... and I hoped that he would at least spare me ... or, so to speak, spare us, us with her, at least wait.

Then, two years later, he sued me for that sum and with the accumulated interest too, and then surprised me again by literally going around and begging coppers for the building of a church. And now for twenty years he has been wandering all over the country. I still don't see why a pilgrim should want to have so much money, which is such a worldly thing. Of course, during the minute I made the offer I was absolutely sincere, overwhelmed, we might say, by my own generous impulse; however, many, many minutes later, it was only natural that I should have second thoughts on the subject and reckon that he'd spare me, or rather us— her and me.

"Я так думаю, что когда смеется человек, то в большинстве случаев на него становится противно смотреть. Чаще всего в смехе людей обнаруживается нечто пошлое, нечто как бы унижающее смеющегося, хотя сам смеющийся почти всегда ничего не знает о впечатлении, которое производит. Точно так же не знает, как и вообще все не знают, каково у них лицо, когда они спят. У иного спящего лицо и во сне умное, а у другого, даже и умного, во сне лицо становится очень глупым и потому смешным. Я не знаю, отчего это происходит: я хочу только сказать, что смеющийся, как и спящий, большею частью ничего не знает про свое лицо. Чрезвычайное множество людей не умеют совсем смеяться. Впрочем, тут уметь нечего: это – дар, и его не выделаешь. Выделаешь разве лишь тем, что перевоспитаешь себя, разовьешь себя к лучшему и поборешь дурные инстинкты своего характера: тогда и смех такого человека, весьма вероятно, мог бы перемениться к лучшему. Смехом иной человек себя совсем выдает, и вы вдруг узнаете всю его подноготную. Даже бесспорно умный смех бывает иногда отвратителен. Смех требует прежде всего искренности, а где в людях искренность? Смех требует беззлобия, а люди всего чаще смеются злобно. Искренний и беззлобный смех – это веселость, а где в людях в наш век веселость и умеют ли люди веселиться? (О веселости в наш век – это замечание Версилова, и я его запомнил.) Веселость человека – это самая выдающая человека черта, с ногами и руками. Иной характер долго не раскусите, а рассмеется человек как-нибудь очень искренно, и весь характер его вдруг окажется как на ладони. Только с самым высшим и с самым счастливым развитием человек умеет веселиться сообщительно, то есть неотразимо и добродушно. Я не про умственное его развитие говорю, а про характер, про целое человека. Итак: если захотите рассмотреть человека и узнать его душу, то вникайте не в то, как он молчит, или как он говорит, или как он плачет, или даже как он волнуется благороднейшими идеями, а высмотрите лучше его, когда он смеется. Хорошо смеется человек – значит хороший человек. Примечайте притом все оттенки: надо, например, чтобы смех человека ни в каком случае не показался вам глупым, как бы ни был он весел и простодушен. Чуть заметите малейшую черту глуповатости в смехе – значит несомненно тот человек ограничен умом, хотя бы только и делал, что сыпал идеями. Если и не глуп его смех, но сам человек, рассмеявшись, стал вдруг почему-то для вас смешным, хотя бы даже немного, – то знайте, что в человеке том нет настоящего собственного достоинства, по крайней мере вполне. Или, наконец, если смех этот хоть и сообщителен, а все-таки почему-то вам покажется пошловатым, то знайте, что и натура того человека пошловата, и все благородное и возвышенное, что вы заметили в нем прежде, – или с умыслом напускное, или бессознательно заимствованное, и что этот человек непременно впоследствии изменится к худшему, займется «полезным», а благородные идеи отбросит без сожаления, как заблуждения и увлечения молодости.","I think that when a person laughs, in most cases it becomes disgusting to look at him. Most often, something vulgar is found in people's laughter, something that seems to humiliate the laugher, although the laugher himself almost always knows nothing about the impression he makes. In the same way, he doesn’t know, just like everyone else doesn’t know what their face is like when they sleep. In a sleeping person, the face is smart even in a dream, and in another, even smart, in a dream the face becomes very stupid and therefore ridiculous. I don’t know why this happens: I only want to say that the laughing one, like the sleeping one, for the most part knows nothing about his own face. An extraordinary number of people do not know how to laugh at all. However, there is nothing to be able to do here: this is a gift, and you cannot make it. You can do it only by re-educating yourself, developing yourself for the better and overcoming the bad instincts of your character: then the laughter of such a person, very likely, could change for the better. With laughter, a certain person gives himself away completely, and you suddenly find out all his ins and outs. Even undeniably intelligent laughter is sometimes disgusting. Laughter requires, first of all, sincerity, but where is sincerity in people? Laughter requires good-naturedness, and people often laugh maliciously. Sincere and good-natured laughter is gaiety, but where is gaiety in people in our age and do people know how to have fun? (About gaiety in our age - this is Versilov's remark, and I remember it.) The gaiety of a person is the most outstanding feature of a person, with legs and arms. You won’t get to the bottom of a different character for a long time, but a person will laugh somehow very sincerely, and his whole character will suddenly appear in full view. Only with the highest and happiest development does a person know how to have fun socially, that is, irresistibly and good-naturedly. I'm not talking about his mental development, but about the character, about the whole person. So: if you want to examine a person and know his soul, then look not into how he is silent, or how he speaks, or how he cries, or even how he is excited by the noblest ideas, but look better at him when he laughs. A person laughing well means a good person. Note, moreover, all shades: it is necessary, for example, that a person’s laughter should in no case seem stupid to you, no matter how cheerful and simple-hearted it may be. Just notice the slightest trait of stupidity in laughter - it means that that person is undoubtedly limited by the mind, even if he only did what he poured out with ideas. If his laughter is not stupid, but the man himself, having laughed, suddenly for some reason became ridiculous for you, even if only a little, then know that in that man there is no real dignity, at least completely. Or, finally, if this laughter, although communicable, nevertheless for some reason seems vulgar to you, then know that the nature of that person is vulgar, and everything noble and sublime that you noticed in him before - or deliberately pretentious , or unconsciously borrowed, and that this person will certainly subsequently change for the worse, engage in “useful”, and reject noble ideas without regret, like the delusions and passions of youth.","I think that, in most cases, a man becomes revolting to look at when he laughs. When most people laugh, they uncover their hidden vulgarity and thus demean themselves, although they seldom realize the painful impression their laughter produces on others. Laughing people have no more idea of what their faces look like than sleepers have of theirs. Some people look very intelligent when they're asleep, while others, even including intelligent people, may look pretty stupid and ridiculous in their sleep. What I'm trying to say is that, as a rule, a laughing man is no more aware of his face than a man asleep. Moreover, most people don't even know how to laugh. And, although it may appear that there's nothing much to it, it is an innate talent and cannot be cultivated. The only way perhaps to change one's laugh would be by re-educating oneself, by becoming a better person, by developing the better instincts in one's nature and overcoming the worse: such a person would probably then have a more beautiful laugh. A man may sometimes give himself away completely by his laugh: you suddenly know everything that lies beneath his outward appearance. Thus, even laughter that is unmistakably intelligent may have something repulsive about it. Laughter demands, above all, sincerity of people, but where does one find sincerity? Real laughter must be free of malice, while it is malice that makes people laugh mostly. Sincere laughter free of malice denotes gaiety, and how many people are there who know how to be gay in this century of ours? (That remark about gaiety was made by Versilov and I remembered it.) A man's way of being gay is perhaps the most revealing feature about him. A man may seem quite inscrutable, but if he bursts into sincere laughter, you'll see his whole character as though you were holding it in the palm of your hand. Only superior and happy natures can radiate communicative gaiety, that is, be irresistibly and cheerfully gay. And when I say ""superior,"" I don't mean intellectually superior but superior in character, as a whole human being. And so, if you wish to glimpse inside a human soul and get to know a man, don't bother analyzing his ways of being silent, of talking, of weeping, or seeing how much he is moved by noble ideas; you'll get better results if you just watch him laugh. If he laughs well, he's a good man. You must, however, note all the shades of his laugh. Thus, it is not good if the laugh strikes you as in the least stupid, even if it's completely sincere and unaffected. As soon as you notice a trace of stupidity in laughter, it indicates that the man is at least somewhat limited, even if he keeps dazzling you with all sorts of ideas. Or, even if his laugh doesn't sound at all stupid but the man himself somehow becomes ridiculous when he laughs, it is an indication that he lacks, at least to a certain extent, personal dignity. Finally, even if the laugh is communicative but still somehow seems vulgar to you, you may rest assured that the man's nature has vulgarity in it, that all the noble and refined traits you noticed in him before were either deliberately affected or unconsciously imitated, and that he will eventually change for the worse, devote himself to the pursuit of the ""useful,"" and discard without regret his noble aspirations as if they were mere delusions of youth.","I consider that in the majority of cases people are revolting to look at when they are laughing. As a rule something vulgar, something as it were degrading, comes to the surface when a man laughs, though he is almost unconscious of the impression he is making in his mirth, as little in fact as anyone knows what he looks like when he is asleep. One person's face will look intelligent asleep, while another man, intelligent in waking life, will look stupid and ridiculous when he is sleeping. I don't know what this is due to: I only mean to say that people laughing, like people asleep, have no idea what they look like. The vast majority of people don't know how to laugh at all. It is not a matter of knowing how, though: it's a gift and it cannot be cultivated. One can only cultivate it, perhaps, by training oneself to be different, by developing and improving and by struggling against the evil instincts of one's character: then a man's laugh might very likely change for the better. A man will sometimes give himself away completely by his laugh, and you suddenly know him through and through. Even an unmistakably intelligent laugh will sometimes be repulsive. What is most essential in laughter is sincerity, and where is one to find sincerity? A good laugh must be free from malice, and people are constantly laughing maliciously. A sincere laugh free from malice is gaiety, and where does one find gaiety nowadays? People don't know how to be gay (Versilov made this observation about gaiety and I remember it). A man's gaiety is what most betrays the whole man from head to foot. Sometimes one will be for a long time unable to read a character, but if the man begins to laugh his whole character will suddenly lie open before you. It is only the loftiest and happiest natures whose gaiety is infectious, that is, good-hearted and irresistible. I am not talking of intellectual development, but of character, of the whole man. And so if you want to see into a man and to understand his soul, don't concentrate your attention on the way he talks or is silent, on his tears, or the emotion he displays over exalted ideas; you will see through him better when he laughs. If a man has a good laugh, it means that he is a good man. Take note of every shade; a man's laugh must never, for instance, strike you as stupid, however gay and good-humoured be may be. If you notice the slightest trace of stupidity in his laughter, you may be sure that that man is of limited intelligence, though he is continually dropping ideas wherever he goes. Even if his laugh is not stupid, but the man himself strikes you as being ever so little ridiculous when he laughs, you may be sure that the man is deficient in personal dignity, to some extent anyway. Or if the laughter though infectious, strikes you for some reason as vulgar, you may be sure that that man's nature is vulgar, and all the generous and lofty qualities you have observed in him before are either intentionally assumed or unconsciously borrowed and that the man is certain to deteriorate, to go in for the profitable, and to cast off his noble ideas without regret as the errors and enthusiasm of youth."
"Я пустился домой; в моей душе был восторг. Все мелькало в уме, как вихрь, а сердце было полно. Подъезжая к дому мамы, я вспомнил вдруг о Лизиной неблагодарности к Анне Андреевне, об ее жестоком, чудовищном слове давеча, и у меня вдруг заныло за них всех сердце! «Как у них у всех жестко на сердце! Да и Лиза, что с ней?» – подумал я, став на крыльцо.","I started home; there was delight in my soul. Everything flashed in my mind like a whirlwind, but my heart was full. As I drove up to my mother's house, I suddenly remembered Liza's ingratitude towards Anna Andreyevna, her cruel, monstrous word the other day, and my heart suddenly ached for them all! “How hard they all have at heart! Yes, and Lisa, what's wrong with her? I thought as I stood on the porch.","I set off for home. There was rapture in me: all sorts of things were flashing through my head; my heart was full to the brim. But when I got close to my mother's house, I suddenly remembered the wicked things Lisa had said about Anna. They were so cruel, so ugly, that a painful feeling came over me. ""Why all this harshness? What's the matter with Lisa? "" I asked myself as the carriage stopped in front of the house.","I set off for home; there was rapture in my soul. My brain was in a whirl, my heart was full. As I drew near my mother's house I recalled Liza's ingratitude to Anna Andreyevna, her cruel and monstrous saying that morning, and my heart suddenly ached for them all! ""How hard their hearts are! And Liza too, what's the matter with her? "" I thought as I stood on the steps."
"Она поднялась наконец уходить; вдруг вошел сам Тушар и с дурацки-важным видом спросил ее, довольна ли она успехами своего сына. Мама начала бессвязно бормотать и благодарить; подошла и Антонина Васильевна. Мама стала просить их обоих «не оставить сиротки, все равно он что сиротка теперь, окажите благодеяние ваше…» – и она со слезами на глазах поклонилась им обоим, каждому раздельно, каждому глубоким поклоном, именно как кланяются «из простых», когда приходят просить о чем-нибудь важных господ. Тушары этого даже не ожидали, а Антонина Васильевна, видимо, была смягчена и, конечно, тут же изменила свое заключение насчет чашки кофею. Тушар, с усиленною важностию, гуманно ответил, что он «детей не рознит, что все здесь – его дети, а он – их отец, что я у него почти на одной ноге с сенаторскими и графскими детьми, и что это надо ценить», и проч., и проч. Мама только кланялась, но, впрочем, конфузилась, наконец обернулась ко мне и со слезами, блеснувшими на глазах, проговорила: «Прощай, голубчик!»","She got up at last to leave; Suddenly Touchard himself came in and, with a foolish air of importance, asked her if she was satisfied with her son's progress. Mama began to mutter incoherently and thank her; Antonina Vasilievna also came up. Mom began to ask them both ""not to leave the orphan, it doesn't matter if he is an orphan now, do your good deed ..."" - and with tears in her eyes she bowed to both of them, each separately, each with a deep bow, just as they bow ""from ordinary people"" when they come to ask important gentlemen about something. The Tushars did not even expect this, and Antonina Vasilievna, apparently, was softened and, of course, immediately changed her opinion about a cup of coffee. Touchard, with heightened importance, humanely replied that he “does not separate children, that everyone here is his children, and he is their father, that I am almost on the same footing with the senatorial and count's children, and that this should be appreciated,” and so on, and so on. Mom only bowed, but, however, was embarrassed, finally turned to me and with tears that flashed in her eyes, she said: “Goodbye, my dear!”","When at last she got up to leave, in came Touchard and, with an idiotically solemn expression, asked her ""whether she was satisfied with her son's scholarly achievements."" Mother muttered something disconnectedly and thanked him and, when Madame Touchard came in too, Mother started begging them ""not to abandon this poor orphan because he is just like an orphan really, so please be good to him . . . "" and, her eyes filled with tears, she bowed deeply to each of them in turn just as humble ""common people"" might bow when they have to ask a favor of the gentry. The Touchards were apparently surprised and Madame Touchard was even visibly touched and quickly revised the conclusions she had drawn when Mother had declined her cup of coffee. Touchard assured her in an affected egalitarian tone that he made no distinction between the boys, that all those who attended the school were just like his own children, and that he was like their father, that I was almost on an equal footing with the sons of counts and senators, that she ought to understand and appreciate that, and so on and so forth in that vein. Mother just kept nodding in appreciation, looking, however, embarrassed; then at last she turned toward me and, with tears glistening in her eyes, said, ""Good-by then, my darling boy!""","She got up to go at last; Touchard suddenly walked in, and with an air of foolish importance asked her: ""Whether she was satisfied with her son's progress? Mother began muttering incoherent thanks; Antonina Vassilyevna came up too. Mother began begging them both ""not to abandon the orphan, who was as good as an orphan now, but to treat him with kindness."" … And with tears in her eyes she bowed to them both, each separately, and to each with a deep bow, exactly as ""simple people"" bow down when they ask a favour of the gentry. The Touchards had not expected this, and Antonina Vassilyevna was evidently softened, and revised her opinion about the cup of coffee. Touchard humanely responded with even greater dignity ""that he made no distinction between the children, that here all were his children, and he was their father, that I was almost on an equal footing with the sons of senators and counts, and that she ought to appreciate that,"" and so on, and so on. Mother only bowed down, but was much embarrassed. At last she turned to me, and with tears shining in her eyes said: ""Good-bye, darling."""

"– Покойник. Оставим. Вы знаете, что не вполне верующий человек во все эти чудеса всегда наиболее склонен к предрассудкам… Но я лучше буду про букет: как я его донес – не понимаю. Мне раза три дорогой хотелось бросить его на снег и растоптать ногой.",- Dead person. Let's leave it. You know that a person who does not fully believe in all these miracles is always the most prone to prejudice ... But I'd rather talk about the bouquet: I don't understand how I conveyed it. Three times I wanted to throw it on the snow and trample it with my foot.,"Mrs. Prutkov asked sharply. ""Why, Makar, of course. But never mind; a person who doesn't accept the miraculous unquestioningly is the most likely to fall for superstitions. . . . Let me go back to these flowers: I really don't know how I finally managed to get them here safely: three times I had to overcome a violent impulse to throw them into the snow and trample on them.""","""Makar Ivanovitch. Never mind. You know that the man who is not entirely a believer in these marvels is always more prone to superstition… . But I had better tell you about the nosegay: how I succeeded in bringing it I don't know. Three times on the way I had a longing to throw it in the snow and trample on it."""
– А вы зачем давеча тоже молчали и не спросили? – раздвинул он рот в самодовольнейшую улыбку.,“And why were you silent just now and didn’t ask?” He parted his mouth into a self-satisfied smile.,"""And what about you? Why didn't you ask me yourself?"" He stretched his lips into a self-satisfied grin.","""And why did you hold your tongue, too, this morning, instead of questioning me?"" he said with a broad grin of intense self- satisfaction."
"– Так я приду к вам, можно? – пролепетал мне наскоро Тришатов, спеша за своим другом.","- So I'll come to you, can I? - Trishatov murmured hastily to me, hurrying after his friend.","""So I'll come and see you, is that all right?"" Trishatov said quickly, as he took off after his friend.","""So I shall come and see you, may I? "" Trishatov murmured hurriedly, and hastened after his friend."
"– О нет: он был слишком отдаленно знаком, через третий дом.","- Oh no: he was too distantly familiar, through the third house.","But surely my mother didn't receive him in her house, did she?"" ""Oh no, he was only slightly acquainted with them, through mutual friends.""","""Oh, no; he was only slightly acquainted with them through other friends."""
"Версилов объяснил мне (уже потом у меня), что князь настоял на своем и положил обвенчаться с Лизой при первой возможности, еще до решения суда. Лизе трудно было решиться, хотя не решиться она уже почти не имела права. Да и Макар Иванович «приказывал» венчаться. Разумеется, все бы это обошлось потом само собой и обвенчалась бы она несомненно и сама без приказаний и колебаний, но в настоящую минуту она так была оскорблена тем, кого любила, и так унижена была этою любовью даже в собственных глазах своих, что решиться ей было трудно. Но, кроме оскорбления, примешалось и новое обстоятельство, которого я и подозревать не мог.","Versilov explained to me (later at my place) that the prince insisted on his own and decided to marry Liza at the first opportunity, even before the court decision. It was difficult for Lisa to make up her mind, although she almost had no right not to make up her mind. Yes, and Makar Ivanovich ""ordered"" to get married. Of course, all this would have worked out of itself later, and she would undoubtedly have married herself without orders or hesitation, but at the present moment she was so offended by the one she loved, and she was so humiliated by this love even in her own eyes, that she had to decide difficult. But besides the insult, there was also a new circumstance, which I could not even suspect.","Later, in my room, Versilov told me that Sergei had insisted they should get married if possible right away, without waiting for the trial. It was hard for Lisa to decide, although she felt she no longer had any right to put off her decision. Besides, Makar had told her she must accept. No doubt everything would have taken its proper course and she would have married Sergei without having to be told to do so by anyone and she wouldn't even have hesitated had it not been for the fact that at that moment she felt insulted by the man she loved while also feeling so degraded by that love in her own eyes that deciding just then seemed unbearably hard for her. But, apart from her mortification, there turned out to be another circumstance that I knew nothing about.","Versilov told me in my room afterwards that Prince Sergay insisted on having his way, and proposed marrying Liza at the first opportunity before his trial was over. It was hard for Liza to make up her mind to it, though she scarcely had the right to refuse. And indeed Makar Ivanovitch ""commanded"" her to be married. Of course all this would have come about of itself, and she would certainly have been married of her own accord and without hesitation, but at the moment she had been so insulted by the man she loved, and she was so humiliated by this love even in her own eyes that it was difficult for her to decide. But apart from her mortification there was another circumstance deterring her of which I could have no suspicion."
Он видимо любовался на мой раскрытый от удивления рот. Никогда и ничего не слыхивал я до сих пор про грудного ребенка. И вот в этот миг вдруг хлопнула дверь у соседок и кто-то быстро вошел в их комнату.,"He apparently admired my open mouth in surprise. Never before have I heard anything about a baby. And at that moment, the door of the neighbors suddenly slammed and someone quickly entered their room.",He looked with obvious pleasure at my mouth hanging open in surprise. I'd never heard anything about a baby. At that moment a door slammed and someone walked quickly into the next room. Then an irritated woman shouted so loudly behind the partition that we could distinctly hear every word she said:,He was evidently delighted at my open-mouthed astonishment. I had never heard anything before about a baby. And at that moment the door of the next room slammed as some one walked rapidly in.
"Анна Андреевна медленно и зорко на нее поглядела, Лиза потупилась. Я, впрочем, очень хорошо видел, что они обе гораздо более и ближе знакомы, чем мог я предположить, входя давеча; эта мысль была мне приятна.","Anna Andreevna looked at her slowly and vigilantly, Liza lowered her eyes. However, I saw very well that they both knew each other much more and more closely than I could have guessed when I entered this evening; this thought pleased me.",Anna looked intently at Lisa. Lisa lowered her eyes. Somehow I realized at that moment that they were much more closely acquainted than I had assumed. That pleased me.,"Anna Andreyevna looked keenly and deliberately at her. Liza dropped her eyes. I could see very clearly, however, that they were on much closer and more intimate terms than I could have possibly imagined; the thought was pleasant."
"– Кажется, здесь будет скоро одна новость. Говорят, она выходит замуж за барона Бьоринга.",“Looks like there will be news soon. She is said to be married to Baron Björing.,"""I believe we're about to hear a piece of news about her: they say she's going to marry Baron Bjoring.""","""I believe we shall soon be hearing a piece of news about her. They say she's engaged to Baron Büring."""
"– В этом по крайней мере я не унизилась перед вами, – промолвила она с чрезвычайным достоинством, по-видимому не поняв мое восклицание.","“In this at least I did not humiliate myself before you,” she said with extraordinary dignity, apparently not understanding my exclamation.","""In this, at least, I haven't humiliated myself before you,"" she said with great dignity, probably misinterpreting my enthusiastic outburst.","""In this anyway I've not humiliated myself before you,"" she enunciated with immense dignity, apparently not understanding my exclamation."

И вот что он сообщил и об этом.,And here's what he said about it.,"""Most important of all is that a document exists which worries Mrs. Akhmakov immensely,"" Kraft declared, and went on to tell me about that document.",And this was what he told me about that.
"– Как, разве сегодня? – вскричал вдруг князь, срываясь с места.","- How, is it today? the prince suddenly exclaimed, breaking away from his seat.","""What, today?"" the prince suddenly shouted, leaping to his feet.","""What, surely not to-day?"" the prince cried suddenly, jumping up from his seat."
"Но в комнате уже был шум и говорили громко; замечу, что Катерина Николаевна вошла в квартиру ровно минуту спустя после них. Шум и говор я заслышал еще из кухни; кричал Ламберт. Она сидела на диване, а он стоял перед нею и кричал как дурак. Теперь я знаю, почему он так глупо потерялся: он торопился и боялся, чтоб их не накрыли; потом я объясню, кого именно он боялся. Письмо было у него в руках. Но Версилова в комнате не было; я приготовился броситься при первой опасности. Передаю лишь смысл речей, может быть, многое и не так припоминаю, но тогда я был в слишком большом волнении, чтобы запомнить до последней точности.","But there was already noise in the room and they were talking loudly; I note that Katerina Nikolaevna entered the apartment exactly a minute later after them. Noise and talk I heard from the kitchen; cried Lambert. She was sitting on the sofa, and he was standing in front of her and screaming like a fool. Now I know why he was so stupidly lost: he was in a hurry and was afraid that they would not be covered; then I will explain who exactly he was afraid of. The letter was in his hands. But Versilov was not in the room; I prepared to throw myself at the first danger. I convey only the meaning of the speeches, maybe I don’t remember much, but then I was in too much excitement to remember to the last accuracy.","The conversation was already quite heated and was being conducted in loud voices. While still in the kitchen, I'd heard Lambert's voice. He was shouting. Katerina, who'd arrived just after them, was sitting on the sofa and Lambert was standing in front of her and shouting as only a fool would. Now I know why he was behaving so stupidly: he was in a tremendous hurry to close the deal and get out of there because he was terrified of being caught (by whom, I'll explain later). He was holding the letter in his hand. Versilov was not in the room. I was ready to rush in at the first sign of danger. I'll try to convey just the gist of what I heard, for the chances are that I missed many details : I was too excited to take in everything.","There was already a noise in the room and they were talking loudly; I may mention that Katerina Nikolaevna arrived at the flat just a minute after them. I heard the noise and talk from the kitchen: Lambert was shouting. She was sitting on the sofa, and he was standing before her shouting like a fool. Now I know why he lost his head so stupidly: he was in a hurry and afraid they would be discovered. I will explain later who it was he feared. The letter was in his hand. But Versilov was not in the room. I was ready to rush in at the first sign of danger. I record only the gist of the conversation, perhaps a good deal I don't remember correctly, but I was too much excited to remember with perfect accuracy."
– Пащенок! Не смей мне больше этого никогда говорить! – проговорила она плача.,- Pashchen! Don't you dare tell me that again! she said crying.,"""You puppy, you! Don't you ever dare say that again!"" She was crying.","""You young puppy! Never dare say that to me again!"" she brought out, crying."
– Лиза! – крикнула было Татьяна Павловна. Макар Иванович опять сделал чрезвычайное усилие.,- Lisa! shouted Tatyana Pavlovna. Makar Ivanovich again made an extraordinary effort.,"""Lisal"" Mrs. Prutkov cried indignantly. Makar again tried desperately to get up.","""Liza!"" cried Tatyana Pavlovna. Makar Ivanovitch made another great effort."

"Я сидел и слушал краем уха; они говорили и смеялись, а у меня в голове была Настасья Егоровна с ее известиями, и я не мог от нее отмахнуться; мне все представлялось, как она сидит и смотрит, осторожно встает и заглядывает в другую комнату. Наконец они все вдруг рассмеялись: Татьяна Павловна, совсем не знаю по какому поводу, вдруг назвала доктора безбожником: «Ну уж все вы, докторишки, – безбожники!..»","I sat and listened out of my ear; they talked and laughed, but Nastasya Yegorovna was in my head with her news, and I could not dismiss her; I kept imagining how she sits and looks, carefully gets up and looks into another room. Finally, they all suddenly burst out laughing: Tatyana Pavlovna, I don’t know at all for what reason, suddenly called the doctor an atheist: “Well, all you doctors are atheists! ..”","As I sat there listening distractedly to their talk and laughter , I was really more preoccupied by what Daria had just told me. I couldn't get that woman out of my head. I kept seeing again and again in my mind's eye how she'd got up from the chair and walked stealthily to the door to make sure that there was no one in the adjoining room. A sudden burst of laughter, however, tore me from my thoughts: it had been provoked by Tatyana suddenly calling the doctor ""godless""—I don't know for what reason—but I heard her suddenly declare: ""Why, you doctors are all a godless bunch, the lot of you!""","I sat listening with half my mind; they talked and laughed and all the time my head was full of Darya Onisimovna, and her news, and I could not shake off the thought of her; I kept picturing how she had sat and looked, and had cautiously got up, and peeped into the next room. At last they all suddenly laughed. Tatyana Pavlovna, I don't in the least know why, called the doctor an infidel: ""Why, all you doctors are infidels!"""
"– Нет, вы – Долгорукий, а не Версилов.","– No, you are Dolgoruky, not Versilov.","""But you're Dolgoruky, not Versilov.""","""No, you are a Dolgoruky, not a Versilov."""

"Мама до того вся вспыхнула, что я никогда еще не видал такого стыда на ее лице. Меня всего передернуло:",Mother blushed so much that I had never seen such shame on her face. I was all overwhelmed:,My mother reddened violently. I'd never seen an expression of such painful shame on her face before. I was outraged.,"My mother flushed painfully, and I had never seen a look of such shame on her face before. Everything seemed to be giving way within me."
"Они говорили о дворянстве. Замечу, что эта идея очень волновала иногда князя, несмотря на весь его вид прогрессизма, и я даже подозреваю, что многое дурное в его жизни произошло и началось из этой идеи: ценя свое княжество и будучи нищим, он всю жизнь из ложной гордости сыпал деньгами и затянулся в долги. Версилов несколько раз намекал ему, что не в том состоит княжество, и хотел насадить в его сердце более высшую мысль; но князь под конец как бы стал обижаться, что его учат. По-видимому, что-то в этом роде было и в это утро, но я не застал начала. Слова Версилова показались мне сначала ретроградными, но потом он поправился.","They talked about the nobility. I note that this idea sometimes worried the prince very much, despite all his kind of progressism, and I even suspect that much bad things in his life happened and began from this idea: appreciating his principality and being a beggar, he poured money all his life out of false pride and got into debt. Versilov hinted to him several times that the principality did not consist in that, and wanted to plant a higher thought in his heart; but in the end the prince, as it were, began to be offended that he was being taught. Apparently there was something of the sort that morning, but I did not find the beginning. Versilov's words seemed to me retrograde at first, but then he recovered.","They were talking about the Russian aristocracy. I must say that this was a subject that aroused Sergei a good deal despite his progressive views. I even suspect that many of his reprehensible acts were caused by his attitude toward his title: he was proud of his ancient name but, having been poor all his life, he had gone deep into debt in order to spend money with what he considered suitable lavishness. Several times Versilov had discreetly suggested to him that a princely title did not consist simply in throwing money around and had tried to implant in him a loftier concept of aristocratic duties. Lately, Sergei had begun to resent being lectured. Well, I gathered that this was the kind of conversation they were having, although I'd missed the beginning. At first, Versilov's position struck me as rather reactionary, but eventually he made up for it.","They were talking of the aristocracy. I may mention that Prince Sergay grew sometimes much excited over this subject in spite of his progressive notions. I suspect indeed that many of his misdoings had their source and origin in this idea. Attaching great significance to his princely rank, he threw money away in all directions although he was a beggar, and became involved in debt. Versilov had more than once hinted that this extravagance was not the essence of princeliness, and tried to instil into him a higher conception of it; but Prince Sergay had begun to show signs of resentment at being instructed. Evidently there had been something of the same sort that morning, but I hadn't arrived in time for the beginning of it. Versilov's words struck me at first as reactionary, but he made up for that later on."
"– Я полагаю, что ты вовсе не так глуп, а только невинен, – промямлил он мне насмешливо. – Если придут, скажи, чтоб меня не ждали к пирожному: я немножко пройдусь.","“I suppose you are not so stupid at all, only innocent,” he mumbled to me mockingly. - If they come, tell me not to wait for the cake: I'll walk a little.","""I never imagined you could be that stupid, although you certainly must be somewhat simple-minded,"" he said quietly with a sarcastic edge to his voice. ""If they come back, tell them not to wait for me for dessert. I'm going out for a short walk.""","""I imagine that you are not so much a fool as an innocent,"" he mumbled to me ironically. ""If they come back, tell them to have their pudding without waiting for me. I am going out for a little."""
– Не застаю! – слегка кивнул он мне головой.,- I won't stop! He slightly nodded his head at me.,"""Can never catch him at home!"" He nodded vaguely in my direction.","""I don't find him in,"" he gave me a slight nod."

"«Вы послушайте, как он выговаривает: „Тут нет еще греха“!» Одним словом, вы были в восхищении. Тут вы вдруг заговорили с Татьяной Павловной по-французски, и она мигом нахмурилась и стала вам возражать, даже очень горячилась; но так как невозможно же противоречить Андрею Петровичу, если он вдруг чего захочет, то Татьяна Павловна и увела меня поспешно к себе: там вымыли мне вновь лицо, руки, переменили белье, напомадили, даже завили мне волосы. Потом к вечеру Татьяна Павловна разрядилась сама довольно пышно, так даже, что я не ожидал, и повезла меня с собой в карете. Я попал в театр в первый раз в жизни, в любительский спектакль у Витовтовой; свечи, люстры, дамы, военные, генералы, девицы, занавес, ряды стульев – ничего подобного я до сих пор не видывал. Татьяна Павловна заняла самое скромное местечко в одном из задних рядов и меня посадила подле. Были, разумеется, и дети, как я, но я уже ни на что не смотрел, а ждал с замиранием сердца представления. Когда вы вышли, Андрей Петрович, я был в восторге, в восторге до слез, – почему, из-за чего, сам не понимаю. Слезы-то восторга зачем? – вот что мне было дико во все эти девять лет потом припоминать! Я с замиранием следил за комедией; в ней я, конечно, понимал только то, что она ему изменила, что над ним смеются глупые и недостойные пальца на ноге его люди. Когда он декламировал на бале, я понимал, что он унижен и оскорблен, что он укоряет всех этих жалких людей, но что он – велик, велик! Конечно, и подготовка у Андроникова способствовала пониманию, но – и ваша игра, Андрей Петрович! Я в первый раз видел сцену! В разъезде же, когда Чацкий крикнул: «Карету мне, карету!» (а крикнули вы удивительно), я сорвался со стула и вместе со всей залой, разразившейся аплодисментом, захлопал и изо всей силы закричал «браво!». Живо помню, как в этот самый миг, точно булавка, вонзился в меня сзади, «пониже поясницы», разъяренный щипок Татьяны Павловны, но я и внимания не обратил! Разумеется, тотчас после «Горе от ума» Татьяна Павловна увезла меня домой: «Не танцевать же тебе оставаться, через тебя только я сама не остаюсь», – шипели вы мне, Татьяна Павловна, всю дорогу в карете. Всю ночь я был в бреду, а на другой день, в десять часов, уже стоял у кабинета, но кабинет был притворен: у вас сидели люди, и вы с ними занимались делами; потом вдруг укатили на весь день до глубокой ночи – так я вас и не увидел! Что такое хотелось мне тогда сказать вам – забыл конечно, и тогда не знал, но я пламенно желал вас увидеть как можно скорей. А назавтра поутру, еще с восьми часов, вы изволили отправиться в Серпухов: вы тогда только что продали ваше тульское имение, для расплаты с кредиторами, но все-таки у вас оставался в руках аппетитный куш, вот почему вы и в Москву тогда пожаловали, в которую не могли до того времени заглянуть, боясь кредиторов; и вот один только этот серпуховский грубиян, один из всех кредиторов, не соглашался взять половину долга вместо всего. Татьяна Павловна на вопросы мои даже и не отвечала: «Нечего тебе, а вот послезавтра отвезу тебя в пансион; приготовься, тетради свои возьми, книжки приведи в порядок, да приучайся сам в сундучке укладывать, не белоручкой расти вам, сударь», да то-то, да это-то, уж барабанили же вы мне, Татьяна Павловна, в эти три дня! Тем и кончилось, что свезли меня в пансион, к Тушару, в вас влюбленного и невинного, Андрей Петрович, и пусть, кажется, глупейший случай, то есть вся-то встреча наша, а, верите ли, я ведь к вам потом, через полгода, от Тушара бежать хотел!","“Listen to how he pronounces:“ There is no sin yet! ” In a word, you were in awe. Here you suddenly spoke to Tatyana Pavlovna in French, and she instantly frowned and began to object to you, even got very excited; but since it’s impossible to contradict Andrey Petrovich, if he suddenly wanted something, Tatyana Pavlovna took me hastily to her place: there they washed my face and hands again, changed my linen, put on pomade, even curled my hair. Then, towards evening, Tatyana Pavlovna discharged herself quite magnificently, so even that I did not expect, and took me with her in a carriage. I went to the theater for the first time in my life, to an amateur performance by Vitovtova; candles, chandeliers, ladies, soldiers, generals, girls, a curtain, rows of chairs - I have never seen anything like it before. Tatyana Pavlovna took the most modest place in one of the back rows and made me sit beside me. There were, of course, children like me, but I no longer looked at anything, but waited with bated breath for the performance. When you left, Andrey Petrovich, I was delighted, delighted to the point of tears - why, because of what, I myself do not understand. Why tears of delight? - that's what it was wild for me in all these nine years later to remember! I followed the comedy with bated breath; in her, of course, I understood only that she had cheated on him, that his people were laughing at him, stupid and unworthy of a toe on his foot. When he recited at the ball, I understood that he was humiliated and insulted, that he reproached all these pathetic people, but that he was great, great! Of course, Andronikov's training contributed to understanding, but - and your game, Andrei Petrovich! I saw the stage for the first time! On the road, when Chatsky shouted: “Carriage for me, carriage!” (and you shouted amazingly), I fell off my chair and, together with the whole hall, bursting into applause, clapped and shouted “Bravo!” with all my might. I vividly remember how at that very moment, like a pin, Tatyana Pavlovna's furious pinch pierced me from behind, ""below the waist"", but I did not pay any attention! Of course, immediately after Woe from Wit, Tatyana Pavlovna took me home: “You can’t stay dancing, only I myself won’t stay through you,” you hissed to me, Tatyana Pavlovna, all the way in the carriage. All night I was delirious, and the next day, at ten o'clock, I was already standing at the office, but the office was pretend: you had people sitting, and you did business with them; then suddenly they drove away for the whole day until late at night - so I didn’t see you! What I wanted to tell you then - I forgot, of course, and didn’t know then, but I ardently wished to see you as soon as possible. And the next morning, from eight o'clock, you deigned to go to Serpukhov: then you had just sold your Tula estate, to pay off creditors, but still you still had an appetizing jackpot in your hands, that's why you came to Moscow then, which until that time they could not look into, being afraid of creditors; and only this Serpukhov rude man, one of all creditors, did not agree to take half of the debt instead of everything. Tatyana Pavlovna did not even answer my questions: “There is nothing for you, but the day after tomorrow I will take you to the boarding house; get ready, take your notebooks, put your books in order, but learn to put them in a chest yourself, you won’t grow up with a white hand, sir, ”yes, yes, you drummed me, Tatyana Pavlovna, these three days! And so it ended up that they took me to a boarding house, to Tushar, who is in love and innocent with you, Andrey Petrovich, and even if, it seems, the stupidest case, that is, our whole meeting, but, believe me, I will come to you later, through half a year, I wanted to run away from Tushar!","the way he stressed the words ""no crime in that""?' You were really full of appreciation. Then you started saying something in French to Mrs. Prutkov that at once brought a frown to her brow. She began arguing with you, very heatedly too, but who can resist Andrei Versilov if he suddenly decides upon something? So she took me by the hand, led me away, washed my face and hands, made me change my underwear and my shirt, pomaded and even curled my hair. Then she herself went to change and came out dressed so gorgeously that I gaped at her openmouthed. Then the two of us got into the carriage and drove to the theater. It was the first time in my life that I'd been taken to a theater, even if only a private performance. The lights, the chandeliers, the elegant ladies, the dashing officers, the important government officials, the pretty young girls, the rows of chairs, the curtain. ... I'd never seen anything like that. . . . Mrs. Prutkov installed herself in a very modest seat in one of the back rows and made me sit down next to her. Of course, there were also some children of my age, but I had no time to take a good look at them so impatient was I for the spectacle to start. ""When you came on, sir, I was ecstatic to the point of tears. Why was I in such a state? I couldn't possibly explain it. Why did tears of rapture fill my eyes? I don't know and for the nine years that followed I felt completely overcome every time I remembered it. I breathlessly followed the plot of the comedy, of which I, of course, only understood that she was unfaithful to him and that stupid people, unworthy of his little finger, were making fun of him. And when he delivered his monologue during the ball I gathered that he'd been insulted and humiliated, that he was denouncing all these wretched creatures, and that he was truly great! Of course, I'd been well prepared by the readings at Andronikov's house, but it was, above all, the way you recited it, yes, your acting, sir! And in the final scene when the guests were leaving and Chatsky called for his carriage, the amazing way you shouted 'Send me my carriage . . .' made me leap to my feet, with the rest of the audience, frantically clap my hands, and yell 'bravo, bravo' at the top of my voice. I also clearly remember the sensation of a violent sting through the seat of my pants, which turned out to be a furious pinch from Mrs. Prutkov. But I hardly paid any attention to it. Of course, as soon as the performance was over, she whisked me away home. ' Why, you didn't expect that you'd stay for the reception and the dance,' she kept hissing at me in the carriage, 'and it's because of you that I couldn't stay myself.' ""I was almost delirious that night, and the following morning at ten I was waiting by the door of your study. But the door was closed, there were people with you, discussing business matters. Then I heard you all leave the house and you were still out that night when I went to sleep. What it was I wanted to tell you so badly I've forgotten, although I'm sure I didn't even know at the time. All I know is that I was in a great hurry to see you. And the morning after that, it was not even eight o'clock when you left for Serpukhov. Around that time, you had sold your Tula estate to pay off your debts, after which you still had quite a bit of money left over. So now you could show yourself in Moscow without fearing your creditors. There was only that 'ill-mannered clod from Serpukhov' who wouldn't settle temporarily for half of what you owed him instead of the whole thing. . . . When I asked about you, Mrs. Prutkov would just ignore my questions: 'That's none of your business. Better get your books and notebooks in order, for remember, I'm taking you to school the day after tomorrow. And it's time you learned to pack your things yourself; you can't expect always to have someone waiting on you.' And you'd start nagging at me for this or that, Mrs. Prutkov, I suppose to drown me out, whenever I mentioned Mr. Versilov during those two or three days. ""And so, sir, I was whisked off to Touchard's boarding school, completely innocent and full of adoration for you, and although this was nothing but a silly incident—I mean that fust meeting of ours—would you believe me if I told you that six months later I was planning to run away from Touchard's to you?""",""" Listen how he brings out 'Indeed , that's not a crime,'"" you said; in fact, you were enthusiastic. Then you said something in French to Tatyana Pavlovna, and she instantly frowned and began to protest, and grew very hot, in fact; but as it was impossible to oppose Andrey Petrovitch if he once took an idea into his head, she hurriedly carried me off to her room, there my hands and face were washed again, my shirt was changed, my hair was pomaded and even curled. ""Then towards evening Tatyana Pavlovna dressed herself up rather grandly as I had never expected to see her, and she took me with her in the carriage. It was the first time in my life I had been to a play; it was at a private performance at Mme. Vitovtov's. The lights, the chandeliers, the ladies, the officers, the generals, the young ladies, the curtain, the rows of chairs, were utterly unlike anything I had seen before. Tatyana Pavlovna took a very modest seat in one of the back rows, and made me sit down beside her. There were, of course, other children like me in the room, but I had no eyes for anything, I simply waited with a sinking of my heart for the performance. When you came on, Andrey Petrovitch, I was ecstatic to the point of tears. What for and why, I don't understand. Why those tears of rapture? It has been a strange recollection for me ever since, for these last nine years! I followed the drama with a throbbing heart; all I understood of it, of course, was that SHE was deceiving HIM, and that he was ridiculed by stupid people who were not worth his little finger. When he was reciting at the ball I understood that he was humiliated and insulted, that he was reproaching all these miserable people, but that he was—great, great! No doubt my training at the Andronikovs' helped me to understand, and your acting, Andrey Petrovitch! It was the first time I had seen a play! When you went off shouting 'A coach, a coach!' (and you did that shout wonderfully) I jumped up from my seat, and while the whole audience burst into applause, I, too, clapped my hands and cried 'bravo' at the top of my voice. I vividly recall how at that instant I felt as though I had been pierced by a pin in my back 'a little below the waist'; Tatyana Pavlovna had given me a ferocious pinch; but I took no notice of it. As soon as 'Woe from Wit' was over, Tatyana Pavlovna took me home, of course. ' You can't stay for the dancing, and it's only on your account I am not staying!' you hissed at me all the way home in the carriage, Tatyana Pavlovna. All night I was delirious, and by ten o'clock the next morning I was standing at the study door, but it was shut; there were people with you and you were engaged in some business with them; then you drove off and were away the whole day till late at night— so I did not see you again! What I meant to say to you, I have forgotten, of course, and indeed I did not know then, but I longed passionately to see you as soon as possible. And at eight o'clock next morning you were graciously pleased to set off for Serpuhov; at that time you had just sold your Tula estate to settle with your creditors, but there was still left in your hands a tempting stake; that was why you had come at that time to Moscow, where you had not been able to show yourself till then for fear of your creditors, and this Serpuhov ruffian was the only one of them who had not agreed to take half of what you owed him instead of the whole. When I questioned Tatyana Pavlovna, she did not even answer me. ' It's no business of yours, but the day after to-morrow I shall take you to your boarding school : get your exercise-books ready, take your lesson books, put them all in order, and you must learn to pack your little box yourself, you can't expect to be waited on, sir.' You were drumming this and that into my ears all those three days, Tatyana Pavlovna. It ended in my being taken in my innocence to school at Touchard's, adoring you, Andrey Petrovitch; our whole meeting was a trivial incident, perhaps, but would you believe it, six months afterwards I longed to run away from Touchard's to you!"""

"Бьоринг свирепо повернулся было опять к слуге и что-то крикнул ему громко, одно или два слова, я не разобрал. Я почувствовал, что кто-то схватил было меня за локоть. В эту минуту карета тронулась; я крикнул было опять и бросился за каретой. Катерина Николавна, я видел это, выглядывала в окно кареты и, кажется, была в большом беспокойстве. Но в быстром движении моем, когда я бросился, я вдруг сильно толкнул, совсем о том не думая, Бьоринга и, кажется, очень больно наступил ему на ногу. Он слегка вскрикнул, скрежетнул зубами и, сильною рукою схватив меня за плечо, злобно оттолкнул, так что я отлетел шага на три. В это мгновение ему подали шинель, он накинул, сел в сани и из саней еще раз грозно крикнул, указывая на меня лакеям и швейцару. Тут они меня схватили и удержали: один слуга набросил на меня шубу, другой подал шляпу, и – я уж не помню, что они тут говорили; они что-то говорили, а я стоял и их слушал, ничего не понимая. Но вдруг бросил их и побежал.","Björing savagely turned back to the servant and shouted something loudly to him, one or two words, I did not understand. I felt that someone was grabbing my elbow. At that moment the carriage started; I called out again and rushed after the carriage. Katerina Nikolaevna, I saw this, was looking out of the carriage window and seemed to be in great anxiety. But in my rapid movement, when I rushed, I suddenly pushed strongly, without thinking about it at all, Bjoring and, it seems, stepped on his foot very painfully. He let out a little cry, gnashed his teeth, and seizing me by the shoulder with a strong hand, pushed me angrily away, so that I flew off about three paces. At that moment they gave him his overcoat, he threw it on, got into the sledge, and from the sleigh shouted menacingly again, pointing at me to the footmen and the porter. Then they grabbed me and held me back: one servant threw a fur coat over me, another gave me a hat, and - I don’t remember what they said here; they said something, and I stood and listened to them, not understanding anything. But suddenly he dropped them and ran.","Furious, Bjoring again turned to the lackey and loudly shouted one or two words to him that I couldn't make out. I felt someone seize me by the elbow. At the same instant the carriage started up. I called out to Katerina again and rushed after the carriage. I saw Katerina's face looking out of the carriage window and I got the impression that she was extremely worried. But, in my violent rush toward the carriage, I must have inadvertently pushed Bjoring and stepped on his foot rather hard, for he let out a muffled cry of pain and clenched his teeth. Then I felt his strong hand catching me by the shoulder and giving me a strong and vicious shove that threw me back about ten feet. At that moment the flunkey handed him his greatcoat, which he threw over his shoulder; he climbed into his sledge and again shouted something imperiously to the doorman and the lackey, pointing at me. This time they seized me and held onto me. A servant threw my coat at me and another one handed me my hat. I can no longer remember what they said, but they did tell me something and I stood there listening to them without understanding a word. Then suddenly I left them standing there and rushed away.","Büring turned savagely to the footman again and shouted something to him loudly, one or two words, I did not take them in. I felt some one clutch me by the elbow. At that moment the carriage began to move; I shouted again and was rushing after the carriage.

But in my hasty movement I jostled against Büring unconsciously, and trod on his foot, hurting him a good deal, I fancy. He uttered a faint cry, clenched his teeth, with a powerful hand grasped me by the shoulder, and angrily pushed me away, so that I was sent flying a couple of yards. At that instant his great-coat was handed him, he put it on, got into his sledge, and once more shouted angrily to the footman and the porter, pointing to me as he did so.

"– Милый мой, – сказал он мне однажды, не дома, а как-то на улице, после длинного разговора; я провожал его. – Друг мой, любить людей так, как они есть, невозможно. И однако же, должно. И потому делай им добро, скрепя свои чувства, зажимая нос и закрывая глаза (последнее необходимо). Переноси от них зло, не сердясь на них по возможности, «памятуя, что и ты человек». Разумеется, ты поставлен быть с ними строгим, если дано тебе быть хоть чуть-чуть поумнее средины. Люди по природе своей низки и любят любить из страху; не поддавайся на такую любовь и не переставай презирать. Где-то в Коране Аллах повелевает пророку взирать на «строптивых» как на мышей, делать им добро и проходить мимо, – немножко гордо, но верно. Умей презирать даже и тогда, когда они хороши, ибо всего чаще тут-то они и скверны. О милый мой, я судя по себе сказал это! Кто лишь чуть-чуть не глуп, тот не может жить и не презирать себя, честен он или бесчестен – это все равно. Любить своего ближнего и не презирать его – невозможно. По-моему, человек создан с физическою невозможностью любить своего ближнего. Тут какая-то ошибка в словах с самого начала, и «любовь к человечеству» надо понимать лишь к тому человечеству, которое ты же сам и создал в душе своей (другими словами, себя самого создал и к себе самому любовь) и которого, поэтому, никогда и не будет на самом деле.","“My dear,” he said to me once, not at home, but somehow on the street, after a long conversation; I followed him. “My friend, it is impossible to love people as they are. And yet, it must. And therefore, do good to them, holding back your feelings, pinching your nose and closing your eyes (the latter is necessary). Endure evil from them, not getting angry with them if possible, ""remembering that you are a man."" Of course, you are assigned to be strict with them, if it is given to you to be even a little smarter than the middle. Human beings are naturally base and love to love out of fear; do not give in to such love and do not cease to despise. Somewhere in the Qur'an, Allah commands the prophet to look at the ""obstinate"" like mice, do good to them and pass by - a little proudly, but true. Know how to despise even when they are good, because more often than not they are bad. Oh my dear, I guess I said it! Whoever is just a little bit stupid cannot live and not despise himself, whether he is honest or dishonest - it does not matter. It is impossible to love your neighbor and not despise him. In my opinion, man was created with the physical impossibility of loving his neighbor. There is some kind of mistake in the words from the very beginning, and “love for humanity” should be understood only for that humanity that you yourself created in your soul (in other words, you created yourself and love for yourself) and which, therefore, , and never really will be.","It happened in the street as I was seeing him off after one of our long conversations in my room. ""You know, my boy,"" he said, ""it's impossible to love men such as they are. And yet we must. So try to do good to men by doing violence to your feelings, holding your nose, and shutting your eyes, especially shutting your eyes. Endure their villainy without anger, as much as possible; try to remember that you're a man too. For, if you're even a little above average intelligence, you'll have the propensity to judge people severely. Men are vile by nature and they'd rather love out of fear. Don't give in to such love: despise it always. There's a passage in the Koran where Allah bids the Prophet look upon those troublesome creatures as upon mice, do them good and pass them by. It may sound rather haughty but it's the right way. Also, you must learn to despise them even if they're well behaved because it's just then that they are most often wicked. You know, my boy, I said that judging from myself. Someone like me, who is not completely stupid, cannot go on living without despising himself, and it makes no difference whether he's honest or not. It's impossible to love one's neighbor without despising him. I believe that man is physically unable to love his neighbor. The very concept of 'love of mankind' is completely misleading from the start, unless 'mankind' is something he has created in his mind (in other words, he invents himself to love himself).","""Dear boy,"" he said one day, not in my room, but in the street, when I was seeing him home after a long conversation, ""to love people as they are is impossible. And yet we must. And therefore do them good, overcoming your feelings, holding your nose and shutting your eyes (the latter's essential). Endure evil from them as far as may be without anger, 'mindful that you too are a man.' Of course you'll be disposed to be severe with them if it has been vouchsafed to you to be ever so little more intelligent than the average. Men are naturally base and like to love from fear. Don't give in to such love, and never cease to despise it. Somewhere in the Koran Allah bids the prophet look upon the 'froward' as upon mice, do them good, and pass them by—a little haughty, but right. Know how to despise them even when they are good, for most often it is in that they are base. Oh, my dear, it's judging by myself I say that. Anyone who's not quite stupid can't live without despising himself, whether he's honest or dishonest—it makes no difference. To love one's neighbour and not despise him—is impossible. I believe that man has been created physically incapable of loving his neighbour. There has been some mistake in language here from the very first, and 'love for humanity' must be understood as love for that humanity which you have yourself created in your soul (in other words, you have created yourself and your love is for yourself)—and which, therefore, never will be in reality."""

""Ah that 'second self'!"" cried Tatyana Pavlovna, wringing her hands. "" Well, this is no use,"" she said decidedly, ""take your cap and coat and quick march together. Lead us straight to them, my good woman. Ach, it's a long way. Marya, Marya, if Katerina Nikolaevna comes, tell her I shall be back directly and make her sit and wait for me, and if she does not want to wait, lock the door and keep her by force. Tell her I told her to. A hundred roubles for you, Marya, if you deserve it."""
"Он быстро заговорил опять о своем «главном». Я понял наконец, что вижу перед собой человека, которому сейчас же надо бы приложить по крайней мере полотенце с уксусом к голове, если не отворить кровь. Весь бессвязный разговор его, разумеется, вертелся насчет процесса, насчет возможного исхода; насчет того еще, что навестил его сам командир полка и что-то долго ему отсоветовал, но он не послушался; насчет записки, им только что и куда-то поданной; насчет прокурора; о том, что его, наверно, сошлют, по лишении прав, куда-нибудь в северную полосу России; о возможности колонизоваться и выслужиться в Ташкенте; о том, что научит своего сына (будущего, от Лизы) тому-то и передаст ему то-то, «в глуши, в Архангельске, в Холмогорах». «Если я пожелал вашего мнения, Аркадий Макарович, то поверьте, я так дорожу чувством… Если б вы знали, если б вы знали, Аркадий Макарович, милый мой, брат мой, что значит мне Лиза, что значила она мне здесь, теперь, все это время!» – вскричал он вдруг, схватываясь обеими руками за голову.","He quickly spoke again about his ""main thing"". I finally realized that I was seeing a man in front of me who should immediately put at least a towel with vinegar on his head, if not to open the blood. His whole incoherent conversation, of course, revolved around the process, about the possible outcome; about the fact that the regiment commander himself visited him and advised him something for a long time, but he did not listen; about the note he had just filed somewhere; about the prosecutor; about the fact that he would probably be exiled, on deprivation of his rights, somewhere in the northern zone of Russia; about the opportunity to colonize and curry favor in Tashkent; that he will teach his son (the future, from Liza) something and pass it on to him, ""in the wilderness, in Arkhangelsk, in Kholmogory."" “If I wanted your opinion, Arkady Makarovich, then believe me, I cherish the feeling so much ...

And he set off once again talking about the ""business"" that was so important to him. I realized then that I was facing a man who should have had a towel soaked in vinegar wrapped around his head or who might even urgently require leeches to draw off some blood. I guessed, though, that his disconnected tirade had to do with his forthcoming trial. And then I gathered that his former regimental commander had come to see him and was trying to advise him not to do something or other, but that Sergei had decided to do it anyhow; also that Sergei had just sent a note somewhere. He said something about the public prosecutor and how he thought he would be deprived of his civil rights and deported to the far north; he also mentioned his plan of settling and farming in Tashkent, of how he would teach his son (Lisa's child) something and pass on to him something or other in Arkhangelsk, in the Kholmogory hills. . . . "" The fact that I wanted to know your opinion, Arkady,"" he said, ""shows how much I respect it. . . . Ah, if only you knew, Arkady, my brother, my dear brother, how much Lisa has meant to me during all the time I've spent here!"" He shouted out these last words, clutching his head between his hands in despair.","He began rapidly talking again of his ""chief point. "" I realized at last that I was listening to a man who ought at once to have at least a vinegar compress applied to his head, if not perhaps to be bled. All his incoherent talk turned, of course, around his trial, and the possible issue of it, and the fact that the colonel of his regiment had visited him and given him a lengthy piece of advice about something which he had not taken, and the notes he had just lately sent to some one, and the prosecutor, and the certainty that they would deprive him of his rights as a nobleman and send him to the Northern Region of Russia, and the possibility of settling as a colonist and regaining his position, in Tashkent, and his plans for training his son (which Liza would bear him) and handing something down to him ""in the wilds of Archangel, in the Holmogory.""

"Марья Ивановна, первого апреля прошлого года, была именинница. Ввечеру пришло несколько гостей, очень немного. Вдруг входит запыхавшись Аграфена и объявляет, что в сенях, перед кухней, пищит подкинутый младенец и что она не знает, как быть. Известие всех взволновало, все пошли и увидели лукошко, а в лукошке – трех– или четырехнедельную пищавшую девочку. Я взял лукошко и внес в кухню и тотчас нашел сложенную записку: «Милые благодетели, окажите доброжелательную помощь окрещенной девочке Арине; а мы с ней за вас будем завсегда воссылать к престолу слезы наши, и поздравляем вас с днем тезоименитства; неизвестные вам люди». Тут Николай Семенович, столь мною уважаемый, очень огорчил меня: он сделал очень серьезную мину и решил отослать девочку немедленно в воспитательный дом. Мне очень стало грустно. Они жили очень экономно, но не имели детей, и Николай Семенович был всегда этому рад. Я бережно вынул из лукошка Ариночку и приподнял ее за плечики; из лукошка пахло каким-то кислым и острым запахом, какой бывает от долго не мытого грудного ребеночка. Поспорив с Николаем Семеновичем, я вдруг объявил ему, что беру девочку на свой счет. Тот стал возражать с некоторою строгостью, несмотря на всю свою мягкость, и хоть кончил шуткой, но намерение насчет воспитательного оставил во всей силе. Однако сделалось по-моему: на том же дворе, но в другом флигеле, жил очень бедный столяр, человек уже пожилой и пивший; но у жены его, очень еще не старой и очень здоровой бабы, только что помер грудной ребеночек и, главное, единственный, родившийся после восьми лет бесплодного брака, тоже девочка и, по странному счастью, тоже Ариночка. Я говорю, по счастью, потому что когда мы спорили в кухне, эта баба, услыхав о случае, прибежала поглядеть, а когда узнала, что это Ариночка, – умилилась. Молоко еще у ней не прошло, она открыла грудь и приложила к груди ребенка. Я припал к ней и стал просить, чтоб унесла к себе, а что я буду платить ежемесячно. Она боялась, позволит ли муж, но взяла на ночь. Наутро муж позволил за восемь рублей в месяц, и я тут же отсчитал ему за первый месяц вперед; тот тотчас же пропил деньги. Николай Семенович, все еще странно улыбаясь, согласился поручиться за меня столяру, что деньги, по восьми рублей ежемесячно, будут вноситься мною неуклонно. Я было стал отдавать Николаю Семеновичу, чтоб обеспечить его, мои шестьдесят рублей на руки, но он не взял; впрочем, он знал, что у меня есть деньги, и верил мне. Этою деликатностью его наша минутная ссора была изглажена. Марья Ивановна ничего не говорила, но удивлялась, как я беру такую заботу. Я особенно оценил их деликатность в том, что они оба не позволили себе ни малейшей шутки надо мною, а стали, напротив, относиться к делу так же серьезно, как и следовало. Я каждый день бегал к Дарье Родивоновне, раза по три, а через неделю подарил ей лично, в руку, потихоньку от мужа, еще три рубля. На другие три рубля я завел одеяльце и пеленки. Но через десять дней Риночка вдруг заболела. Я тотчас привез доктора, он что-то прописал, и мы провозились всю ночь, мучая крошку его скверным лекарством, а на другой день он объявил, что уже поздно, и на просьбы мои – а впрочем, кажется, на укоры – произнес с благородною уклончивостью: «Я не Бог». Язычок, губки и весь рот у девочки покрылись какой-то мелкой белой сыпью, и она к вечеру же умерла, упирая в меня свои большие черные глазки, как будто она уже понимала. Не понимаю, как не пришло мне на мысль снять с нее, с мертвенькой, фотографию. Ну, поверят ли, что я не то что плакал, а просто выл в этот вечер, чего прежде никогда не позволял себе, и Марья Ивановна принуждена была утешать меня – и опять-таки совершенно без насмешки ни с ее, ни с его стороны. Столяр же сделал и гробик; Марья Ивановна отделала его рюшем и положила хорошенькую подушечку, а я купил цветов и обсыпал ребеночка: так и снесли мою бедную былиночку, которую, поверят ли, до сих пор не могу позабыть. Немного, однако, спустя все это почти внезапное происшествие заставило меня даже очень задуматься. Конечно, Риночка обошлась недорого – со всем: с гробиком, с погребением, с доктором, с цветами и с платой Дарье Родивоновне – тридцать рублей. Эти деньги, отъезжая в Петербург, я наверстал на присланных мне на выезд Версиловым сорока рублях и продажею кой-каких вещиц перед отъездом, так что весь мой «капитал» остался неприкосновенным. «Но, – подумал я, – если я буду так сбиваться в сторону, то недалеко уеду». В истории с студентом выходило, что «идея» может увлечь до неясности впечатлений и отвлечь от текущей действительности. Из истории с Риночкой выходило обратное, что никакая «идея» не в силах увлечь (по крайней мере меня) до того, чтоб я не остановился вдруг перед каким-нибудь подавляющим фактом и не пожертвовал ему разом всем тем, что уже годами труда сделал для «идеи». Оба вывода были тем не менее верны.","Marya Ivanovna, on the first of April last year, was the birthday girl. In the evening a few guests came, very few. Suddenly, out of breath, Agrafena enters and announces that in the hallway, in front of the kitchen, a thrown baby is squeaking and that she does not know what to do. The news excited everyone, everyone went and saw a basket, and in the basket - a three- or four-week-old squeaking girl. I took the basket and brought it into the kitchen and immediately found a folded note: “Dear benefactors, provide benevolent help to the baptized girl Arina; and we will always send our tears to the throne for you, and we congratulate you on your name day; people you don't know."" Here Nikolai Semyonovich, whom I respect so much, upset me very much: he made a very serious face and decided to send the girl immediately to an orphanage. I became very sad. They lived very economically, but did not have children, and Nikolai Semenovich was always happy about this. I carefully took Arinochka out of the basket and lifted her by the shoulders; the basket smelled of some sour and pungent smell, such as comes from a long-term unwashed baby. After arguing with Nikolai Semyonovich, I suddenly announced to him that I was taking the girl on my own account. He began to object with some severity, in spite of all his gentleness, and although he ended with a joke, he left his intention regarding education in full force. However, it happened in my opinion: in the same courtyard, but in a different outbuilding, there lived a very poor carpenter, a man already elderly and drinking; but his wife, a very young and very healthy woman, had just lost her baby and, most importantly, the only one born after eight years of fruitless marriage, also a girl and, by strange happiness, also Arinochka. I say fortunately, because when we were arguing in the kitchen, this woman, having heard about the case, came running to have a look, and when she found out that it was Arinochka, she was touched. Her milk had not passed yet, she opened her breast and put the baby to her breast. I clung to her and began to ask her to take her away, and what I would pay monthly. She was afraid if her husband would allow it, but she took it for the night. The next morning my husband allowed me for eight rubles a month, and I immediately counted him the first month in advance; he immediately drank the money away. Nikolai Semyonovich, still smiling strangely, agreed to vouch for me to the carpenter that the money, eight rubles a month, would be steadily paid in by me. I was about to give Nikolai Semyonovich, in order to provide for him, my sixty rubles in my hands, but he did not take it; however, he knew that I had money, and believed me. By this delicacy of his, our momentary quarrel was smoothed out. Marya Ivanovna said nothing, but was surprised how I take such care. I especially appreciated their delicacy in that they both did not allow themselves the slightest joke on me, but, on the contrary, began to take the matter as seriously as they should. Every day I ran to Darya Rodivonovna, three times, and a week later I gave her personally, in her hand, quietly from her husband, another three rubles. For the other three rubles, I got a blanket and diapers. But ten days later, Rinochka suddenly fell ill. I immediately brought the doctor, he prescribed something, and we fussed all night, tormenting his baby with bad medicine, and the next day he announced that it was already late, and in response to my requests - but, it seems, to reproaches - he uttered with a noble evasiveness: ""I am not God."" The girl's tongue, lips and whole mouth were covered with some kind of small white rash, and by the evening she died, fixing her big black eyes on me, as if she already understood. I don’t understand how it didn’t occur to me to take a photograph of her, with the dead one. Well, will they believe that I didn’t just cry, but simply howled that evening, which I had never allowed myself before, and Marya Ivanovna was forced to console me - and again, completely without ridicule either on her or on his part. The carpenter also made a coffin; Marya Ivanovna trimmed it with ruffles and laid a pretty pillow, and I bought flowers and sprinkled the baby: and so they took down my poor blade of grass, which, if you believe it, I still can’t forget. A little, however, after all this almost sudden incident made me even very thoughtful. Of course, Rinochka didn't cost much - with everything: with the coffin, with the burial, with the doctor, with the flowers, and with the payment to Darya Rodivonovna - thirty rubles. When I left for Petersburg, I made up for this money with the forty rubles sent to me by Versilov and by selling some things before leaving, so that all my “capital” remained untouched. “But,” I thought, “if I stray to the side like that, I won’t go far.” In the story with the student, it turned out that the “idea” can captivate to the point of obscurity of impressions and distract from the current reality. From the story with Rinochka it turned out the opposite, that no “idea” could captivate (at least me) to such an extent that I would not suddenly stop before some overwhelming fact and would not immediately sacrifice to it everything that I had already done for years of work for ""ideas"". Both conclusions were nevertheless correct.","Last April 1 a few guests came over in the evening to congratulate Maria on her name day. Suddenly the maid Agrafenya rushed in and told us breathlessly that she'd found behind the kitchen door, on the landing of the service staircase, an abandoned screaming baby. What was to be done about it? This caused quite a stir among us and we all hurried over and saw a bark basket: inside it a three- or four-week-old baby was crying away. I picked up the basket, brought it into the kitchen, and only then noticed the folded note that went something like this: Dear, kind folks: Be charitable to this little girl christened Arina, who later will join us in the prayers for you that we address to the heavenly throne, and we also congratulate you on your name day. Persons unknown to you. Nikolai, a man for whom I had always had the highest respect, disappointed me deeply on that occasion. His face suddenly became very grave and he declared that the baby must immediately be sent to a foundling home. It made me feel very sad. It's true they lived very frugally; they had no children of their own and Nikolai was pleased that they were childless. I picked up the little Arina gently by her tiny shoulders, lifted her out of the basket, and got a whiff of that sour, pungent smell of a baby that hasn't been changed or washed for a long time. I said that I wanted the baby girl to stay with us and that I'd take all the expenses upon myself. Nikolai said I couldn't do that and we started arguing the point. Despite his usual gentleness, Nikolai wouldn't change his mind and stuck firmly to his decision, although he tried to make it easier by ribbing me gently about my notion. Still, eventually the baby was not sent off to a foundling home. In another wing of our house there lived a very poor carpenter, an aging man who drank a lot and was married to a younger woman, a very vigorous one at that, who had just lost her own baby, the only one they'd had after eight years of childless marriage. By a strange and lucky coincidence, that baby had also been a girl and had also been christened Arina. I said lucky because, while Nikolai and I were arguing about the little Arina, the carpenter's wife heard us, stopped, inquired about what had happened, and, when told that Arina was the baby's name, became terribly moved. She said she still had milk, unfastened her dress, and held the baby to her breast. While she was feeding the baby, I pleaded with her to take it and said I'd pay for it every month. She said she wasn't sure whether her husband would agree, but said she'd keep the little Arina overnight. In the morning, the old carpenter came to tell me that he'd be willing to keep the baby if I paid him eight rubles a month. I immediately counted off eight rubles to pay him for one month in advance. He took the money and spent it all forthwith on liquor. Nikolai, smiling strangely, agreed to guarantee that the man would receive his eight rubles even if I was unable to keep my end of the deal. I wanted to give Nikolai all my sixty rubles of savings, but he refused. He said he knew that I had money and trusted me to pay. That delicate tactfulness made me forget at once the irritation I had felt during our argument. Maria didn't interfere but seemed surprised that I was willing to take upon myself such a responsibility. I appreciated their tact, especially since neither of them made any more flippant remarks about my decision; indeed, they now treated the matter with all the seriousness it deserved. I started dashing over to see the carpenter's wife three times a day and, toward the end of the week, I managed to slip her an extra three rubles without her husband noticing it. I spent another three rubles on a little blanket and on swaddling clothes. But ten days later, little Arina fell ill. I got a doctor to examine her. He prescribed some medicine for her and we spent a whole night forcing the poor little thing to swallow the foul-tasting stuff. The next day the doctor came and said we had sent for him too late; when I begged him, perhaps with a tinge of reproach, to do something, he gave me that final majestic excuse: "" I'm not God, after all, am I? "" A minute white rash appeared on the little girl's tongue, lips, and all around her mouth, and toward evening she died, with her dark eyes fixed on me as though she knew what was happening to her. I don't know why it never occurred to me to take a picture of the dead baby. You might not believe me if I told you that what I did that night could hardly be described as weeping: I literally howled like an animal, something that I'd never done before (or since). Maria tried to comfort me as much as she could and, again, she did it with the utmost tact; neither she nor Nikolai showed in any way that they thought there might be something peculiar in my behavior. It was our carpenter who made the coffin. Maria supplied him with some material to line the coffin and a pretty little pillow, while I bought some flowers and strewed them over the dead child; and this is how they carried off my poor little baby whom, believe it or not, I cannot forget. A little later, however, strange thoughts crept into my mind in connection with the whole episode. Little Arina hadn't really cost me very much. Including the coffin, the burial, the doctor, the flowers, and the money given to the carpenter's wife, I'd say, all told, it came to about thirty rubles. I made up the loss out of the forty rubles Versilov sent me for my trip and from the sale before I left of various possessions of mine, so that in the end my capital was the same as it had been before. ""Still,"" I thought, ""if I continue straying from my path like this, I'll never get anywhere."" So, while the episode with the former university student showed that my ""idea"" was capable of blurring the messages my brain received from my senses, the episode with the baby Arina showed just the opposite—namely, that no ""idea"" could capture a man (at least me) so completely as to enable him to ignore something overwhelmingly moving and to prevent him from sacrificing to it the results of years of effort directed toward the realization of his ""idea."" And both the seemingly opposite observations were correct.","On the 1st of April last year, Marie Ivanovna was keeping her name- day; some visitors, though only a few, came for the evening. Suddenly Agrafena rushed in, out of breath, announcing that a baby was crying in the passage before the kitchen, and that she didn't know what to do. We were all excited at the news. We went out and saw a bark basket, and in the basket a three or four weeks old child, crying. I picked up the basket and took it into the kitchen. Then I immediately found a folded note: ""Gracious benefactors, show kind charity to the girl christened Arina, and we will join with her to send our tears to the Heavenly throne for you for ever, and congratulate you on your name-day, Persons unknown to you."" Then Nikolay Semyonovitch, for whom I have such a respect, greatly disappointed me. He drew a very long face and decided to send the child at once to the Foundling Home. I felt very sad. They lived very frugally but had no children, and Nikolay Semyonovitch was always glad of it. I carefully took little Arina out of the basket and held her up under the arms. The basket had that sour, pungent odour characteristic of a small child which has not been washed for a long time. I opposed Nikolay Semyonovitch, and suddenly announced that I would keep the child at my expense. In spite of his gentleness he protested with some severity, and, though he ended by joking, he adhered to his intention in regard to the foundling. I got my way, however. In the same block of buildings, but in a different wing, there lived a very poor carpenter, an elderly man, given to drink, but his wife, a very healthy and still youngish peasant woman, had only just lost a baby, and, what is more, the only child she had had in eight years of marriage, also a girl, and by a strange piece of luck also called Arina. I call it good luck, because while we were arguing in the kitchen, the woman, hearing of what had happened, ran in to look at the child, and when she learned that it was called Arina, she was greatly touched. She still had milk, and unfastening her dress she put the baby to her breast. I began persuading her to take the child home with her, saying I would pay for it every month. She was afraid her husband would not allow it, but she took it for the night. Next morning, her husband consented to her keeping it for eight roubles a month, and I immediately paid him for the first month in advance. He at once spent the money on drink. Nikolay Semyonovitch, still with a strange smile, agreed to guarantee that the money should be paid regularly every month. I would have given my sixty roubles into Nikolay Semyonovitch's keeping as security, but he would not take it. He knew, however, that I had the money, and trusted me. Our momentary quarrel was smoothed over by this delicacy on his part. Marie Ivanovna said nothing, but wondered at my undertaking such a responsibility. I particularly appreciated their delicacy in refraining from the slightest jest at my expense, but, on the contrary, taking the matter with proper seriousness. I used to run over to the carpenter's wife three times a day, and at the end of a week I slipped an extra three roubles into her hand without her husband's knowledge. For another three I bought a little quilt and swaddling clothes. But ten days later little Arina fell ill. I called in a doctor at once, he wrote a prescription, and we were up all night, tormenting the mite with horrid medicine. Next day he declared that he had been sent for too late, and answered my entreaties—which I fancy were more like reproaches—by saying with majestic evasiveness: ""I am not God. "" The baby's little tongue and lips and whole mouth were covered with a minute white rash, and towards evening she died, gazing at me with her big black eyes, as though she understood already. I don't know why I never thought to take a photograph of the dead baby. But will it be believed, that I cried that evening, and, in fact, I howled as I had never let myself do before, and Marie Ivanovna had to try to comfort me, again without the least mockery either on her part or on Nikolay Semyonovitch's. The carpenter made a little coffin, and Marie Ivanovna finished it with a frill and a pretty little pillow, while I bought flowers and strewed them on the baby. So they carried away my poor little blossom, whom it will hardly be believed I can't forget even now. A little afterwards, however, this sudden adventure made me reflect seriously. Little Arina had not cost me much, of course; the coffin, the burial, the doctor, the flowers, and the payment to the carpenter's wife came altogether to thirty roubles. As I was going to Petersburg I made up this sum from the forty roubles sent me by Versilov for the journey, and from the sale of various articles before my departure, so that my capital remained intact. But I thought: ""If I am going to be turned aside like this I shan't get far."" The affair with the student showed that the ""idea"" might absorb me till it blurred my impressions and drew me away from the realities of life. The incident with little Arina proved, on the contrary, that no ""idea"" was strong enough to absorb me, at least so completely that I should not stop short in the face of an overwhelming fact and sacrifice to it at once all that I had done for the ""idea"" by years of labour. Both conclusions were nevertheless true."

"– Но чем, скажите, вывод Крафта мог бы ослабить стремление к общечеловеческому делу? – кричал учитель (он один только кричал, все остальные говорили тихо). – Пусть Россия осуждена на второстепенность; но можно работать и не для одной России.

Besides, how could Kraft be a patriot when he has lost faith in Russia?""","""But how, tell me, please, could Kraft's deduction weaken the impulse to the cause of humanity,"" shouted the teacher. (He was the only one shouting. All the others spoke in a low voice.) ""Let Russia be condemned to second-rateness, but we can still work and not for Russia alone. And, what's more, how can Kraft be a patriot if he has ceased to believe in Russia?"""
"Но оставим. Так или этак, а наступило затишье. Я просто понял, что выздороветь надо во что бы ни стало и как можно скорее, чтобы как можно скорее начать действовать, а потому решился жить гигиенически и слушаясь доктора (кто бы он ни был), а бурные намерения, с чрезвычайным благоразумием (плод широкости), отложил до дня выхода, то есть до выздоровления. Каким образом могли сочетаться все мирные впечатления и наслаждения затишьем с мучительно сладкими и тревожными биениями сердца при предчувствии близких бурных решений – не знаю, но все опять отношу к «широкости». Но прежнего недавнего беспокойства во мне уже не было; я отложил все до срока, уже не трепеща перед будущим, как еще недавно, но как богач, уверенный в своих средствах и силах. Надменности и вызова ожидавшей меня судьбе прибывало все больше и больше, и отчасти, полагаю, от действительного уже выздоровления и от быстро возвращавшихся жизненных сил. Вот эти-то несколько дней окончательного и даже действительного выздоровления я и вспоминаю теперь с полным удовольствием.","But let's leave it. One way or another, it was quiet. I simply realized that it was necessary to recover at all costs and as soon as possible in order to begin acting as soon as possible, and therefore I decided to live hygienically and obeying the doctor (whoever he was), and stormy intentions, with extreme prudence (the fruit of broadness ), postponed until the day of release, that is, until recovery. How could all peaceful impressions and pleasures of calm be combined with painfully sweet and disturbing heartbeats at the foreboding of imminent stormy decisions - I don’t know, but again I attribute everything to “broadness”. But I no longer had the former anxiety of late; I postponed everything until the deadline, no longer trembling before the future, as only recently, but as a rich man, confident in his means and strength. Arrogance and challenge to the fate that awaited me came more and more, and partly, I believe, from a real recovery already and from the quickly returning vitality. It is these few days of final and even real recovery that I now recall with complete pleasure.","But let's leave that for now. One way or the other, a lull followed. I plainly realized that, whatever I had to do, first I had to get well quickly so I could get on with my plans. I decided to lead a healthy life and follow the doctor's orders (however little I thought of the man). So I sensibly postponed the execution of my rebellious intentions (the products of my breadth!) until I had fully recovered my strength. How the peaceful healthy joys and musings of that restful period could coexist side by side with the intoxicating and restless throbbings in my heart, I cannot explain and can only suggest again that it might be due to that breadth of mine. But I was no longer worrying as before: I felt I would be able to cope with everything when the time came; I no longer trembled at the thought of the future as I had until then; I was now like a rich man, confident of his resources and power. I felt more and more defiant of whatever challenge fate held in store for me, more and more arrogant, I might say, which was probably due to my returning health and to the rapid recovery of my vital energies. And so those few days of final and complete recovery evoke extremely pleasant memories in me.","But enough of that. However that may be, a time of calm followed. All I knew was that I must get well at all costs and as quickly as possible that I might as soon as possible begin to act, and so I resolved to live hygienically and to obey the doctor (whoever he might be), disturbing projects I put off with great good sense (the fruit of this same breadth) to the day of my escape, that is, to the day of my complete recovery. How all the peaceful impressions and sensations in that time of stillness were consistent with the painfully sweet and agitated throbbings of my heart when I dreamed of violent decisions I do not know, but again I put it all down to ""breadth."" But there was no trace now of the restlessness I had suffered from of late. I put it all off for the time, and did not tremble at the thought of the future as I had so recently, but looked forward to it, like a wealthy man relying on his power and his resources. I felt more and more proud and defiant of the fate awaiting me, and this was partly due, I imagine, to my actual return to health, and the rapid recovery of my vital forces. Those few days of final and complete recovery I recall even now with great pleasure."

"И вот, никогда не забуду и с гордостью вспомяну, что я не поехал! Это никому не будет известно, так и умрет, но довольно и того, что это мне известно и что я в такую минуту был способен на благороднейшее мгновение! «Это искушение, а я пройду мимо его, – решил я наконец, одумавшись, – меня пугали фактом, а я не поверил и не потерял веру в ее чистоту! И зачем ехать, о чем справляться? Почему она так непременно должна была верить в меня, как я в нее, в мою „чистоту“, не побояться „пылкости“ и не заручиться Татьяной? Я еще не заслужил этого в ее глазах. Пусть, пусть она не знает, что я заслуживаю, что я не соблазняюсь „искушениями“, что я не верю злым на нее наветам: зато я сам это знаю и буду себя уважать за это. Уважать свое чувство. О да, она допустила меня высказаться при Татьяне, она допустила Татьяну, она знала, что тут сидит и подслушивает Татьяна (потому что та не могла не подслушивать), она знала, что та надо мной смеется, – это ужасно, ужасно! Но… но ведь – если невозможно было этого избежать? Что ж она могла сделать в давешнем положении и как же ее за это винить? Ведь налгал же я ей давеча сам про Крафта, ведь обманул же и я ее, потому что невозможно было тоже этого избежать, и я невольно, невинно налгал. Боже мой! – воскликнул я вдруг, мучительно краснея, – а сам-то, сам-то что я сейчас сделал: разве я не потащил ее перед ту же Татьяну, разве я не рассказал же сейчас все Версилову? Впрочем, что ж я? тут – разница. Тут было только о документе; я, в сущности, сообщил Версилову лишь о документе, потому что и не было больше о чем сообщать, и не могло быть. Не я ли первый предуведомил его и кричал, что „не могло быть“? Это – человек понимающий. Гм… Но какая же, однако, ненависть в его сердце к этой женщине даже доселе! И какая же, должно быть, драма произошла тогда между ними и из-за чего? Конечно, из самолюбия! Версилов ни к какому чувству, кроме безграничного самолюбия, и не может быть способен!»","And now, I will never forget and proudly remember that I did not go! No one will know this, it will die like that, but it is enough that I know this and that at such a moment I was capable of the noblest moment! “This is a temptation, and I will pass it by,” I finally decided, having changed my mind, “they frightened me with a fact, but I did not believe and did not lose faith in its purity! And why go, what to inquire about? Why did she absolutely have to believe in me, as I did in her, in my “purity”, not be afraid of “ardor” and not enlist Tatyana? I have not yet earned it in her eyes. Let her not know that I deserve it, that I am not tempted by ""temptations"", that I do not believe in evil slanders against her: but I myself know this and will respect myself for it. Respect your feeling. Oh, yes, she allowed me to speak in front of Tatyana, she allowed Tatyana, she knew that Tatyana was sitting there and eavesdropping (because she could not help but eavesdrop), she knew that she was laughing at me - it's terrible, terrible! But ... but after all - if it was impossible to avoid this? What could she have done in her present position, and how can she be blamed for it? After all, I myself lied to her just now about Kraft, after all, I also deceived her, because it was also impossible to avoid this, and I involuntarily, innocently lied. My God! I exclaimed suddenly, blushing agonizingly, “and what have I done myself, what have I just done: didn’t I drag Tatyana in front of her, didn’t I tell Versilov everything just now? However, what am I? here is the difference. It was only about the document; I, in essence, informed Versilov only about the document, because there was nothing more to report, and could not be. Was it not I who warned him first and shouted that “it couldn’t be”? This is a man who understands. Hm ... But what, however, is the hatred in his heart for this woman even until now! And what kind of drama must have happened then between them and because of what? Of course, out of pride! Versilov can’t be capable of any feeling other than boundless self-love!”","But I didn't go and I shall always remember with pride that I did not! No one will ever know it and the knowledge will die with me, but it's enough for me that I know it and that I was capable of such noble resolution under those painful circumstances. ""This is a temptation, but I'll ignore it,"" I finally made up my mind. ""I was threatened with factual evidence, but I refused to believe and I never lost faith in her purity! And what would be the point of going there and asking her? How could I demand of her that she have as much faith in my 'purity' as I have in hers and that she be certain that I can overcome my 'ardor' and feel she doesn't need the extra insurance of Tatyana Prutkov's physical presence? I haven't yet deserved that much trust on her part. So let her not know yet that I do deserve her trust, that I do not yield to temptations, that I never believed the wicked things said about her! As long as I know it myself, it will give me some self-respect. . . . Yes, yes, but still she allowed me to open my heart within Tatyana's earshot; she allowed that woman to listen because she must have realized that Tatyana wouldn't miss the opportunity to eavesdrop, she knew that Tatyana would laugh at me . . . and that's just terrible, terrible! But . . . but perhaps she couldn't avoid it? Perhaps she had no control over the circumstances and couldn't change them? So how can I blame her? Besides, didn't I he to her about Kraft? I deceived her because I felt I couldn't avoid it and lied to her in all innocence. Ah, my God! "" I suddenly cried out loud, feeling the blood rush to my face. ""What have I just done myself? Wasn't that as bad as letting Tatyana eavesdrop on us? Why, didn't I just repeat everything to Versilov? . . . No, not quite, there's a difference. It was all confined to the document—I actually told Versilov only about what concerned that document. Besides, there was nothing else I could tell him, there couldn't possibly be! Wasn't I emphatic from the start in telling him that there was nothing between her and me and couldn't be? And he's a man of great understanding. He has, nevertheless, a deep hatred for her to this day. Something frightfully dramatic must have happened between the two of them! What could possibly have caused it? I'm sure it was all a matter of pride. Versilov is incapable of any feeling except boundless pride.""","I shall never forget and I recall with pride that I did NOT go! It will never be known to anyone, it will die with me, but it's enough that I know of it and at such a moment I was capable of an honourable impulse. ""This is a temptation, and I will put it behind me,"" I made up my mind at last, on second thoughts. They had tried to terrify me with a fact, but I refused to believe it, and had not lost my faith in her purity! And what had I to go for, what was there to find out about? Why was she bound to believe in me as I did in her, to have faith in my ""purity,"" not to be afraid of my ""impulsiveness"" and not to provide against all risks with Tatyana? I had not yet, as far as she could see, deserved her confidence. No matter, no matter that she does not know that I am worthy of it, that I am not seduced by ""temptations,"" that I do not believe in malicious calumnies against her; I know it and I shall respect myself for it. I shall respect my own feeling. Oh, yes, she had allowed me to utter everything before Tatyana, she had allowed Tatyana to be there, she knew that Tatyana was sitting there listening (for she was incapable of not listening); she knew that she was laughing at me out there,—that was awful, awful! But … but what if it were impossible to avoid it? What could she have done in her position, and how could one blame her for it? Why, I had told her a lie about Kraft, I had deceived her because that, too, could not be helped, and I had lied innocently against my will. "" My God!"" I cried suddenly, flushing painfully, ""what have I just done myself! Haven't I exposed her, too, before Tatyana, haven't I repeated it all to Versilov just now? Though, after all, there was a difference. It was only a question of the letter; I had in reality only told Versilov about the letter because there was nothing else to tell, and could be nothing else. Was not I the first to declare that ""there could not be""? He was a man of insight. Hm! But what hatred there was in his heart for this woman even to this day! And what sort of drama must have taken place between them in the past, and about what? All due to vanity, of course!"" VERSILOV CANNOT BE CAPABLE OF ANY FEELING BUT BOUNDLESS VANITY!"""

"Колокол ударял твердо и определенно по одному разу в две или даже в три секунды, но это был не набат, а какой-то приятный, плавный звон, и я вдруг различил, что это ведь – звон знакомый, что звонят у Николы, в красной церкви напротив Тушара, – в старинной московской церкви, которую я так помню, выстроенной еще при Алексее Михайловиче, узорчатой, многоглавой и «в столпах», – и что теперь только что минула Святая неделя и на тощих березках в палисаднике тушаровского дома уже трепещут новорожденные зелененькие листочки. Яркое предвечернее солнце льет косые свои лучи в нашу классную комнату, а у меня, в моей маленькой комнатке налево, куда Тушар отвел меня еще год назад от «графских и сенаторских детей», сидит гостья. Да, у меня, безродного, вдруг очутилась гостья – в первый раз с того времени, как я у Тушара. Я тотчас узнал эту гостью, как только она вошла: это была мама, хотя с того времени, как она меня причащала в деревенском храме и голубок пролетел через купол, я не видал уж ее ни разу. Мы сидели вдвоем, и я странно к ней приглядывался. Потом, уже спустя много лет, я узнал, что она тогда, оставшись без Версилова, уехавшего вдруг за границу, прибыла в Москву на свои жалкие средства самовольно, почти украдкой от тех, которым поручено было тогда о ней попечение, и это единственно чтоб со мной повидаться. Странно было и то, что, войдя и поговорив с Тушаром, она ни слова не сказала мне самому, что она – моя мать. Она сидела подле меня, и, помню, я даже удивлялся, что она мало так говорит. С ней был узелок, и она развязала его: в нем оказалось шесть апельсинов, несколько пряников и два обыкновенных французских хлеба. Я обиделся на французские хлебы и с ущемленным видом ответил, что здесь у нас «пища» очень хорошая и нам каждый день дают к чаю по целой французской булке.","The bell struck firmly and definitely once every two or even three seconds, but it was not an alarm, but some kind of pleasant, smooth ringing, and I suddenly discerned that it was a familiar ringing, that they ring at Nikola's, in red church opposite Tushar - in the old Moscow church, which I remember so well, built back in the time of Alexei Mikhailovich, patterned, many-domed and ""in pillars"" - and now Holy Week has just passed and newborns are already trembling on the skinny birch trees in the front garden of Tushar's house green leaves. The bright late afternoon sun pours its slanting rays into our classroom, and in my little room on the left, where Touchard took me a year ago from the “count and senatorial children”, a guest is sitting. Yes, I, a rootless person, suddenly found myself with a guest - for the first time since the time I was at Tushar. I immediately recognized this guest as soon as she entered: it was my mother, although since the time she gave me communion in the village church and the dove flew through the dome, I had not seen her even once. We sat together, and I looked at her strangely. Later, many years later, I learned that she then, left without Versilov, who had suddenly gone abroad, arrived in Moscow on her pitiful means without permission, almost furtively from those who were then entrusted with the care of her, and this is the only thing to to see me. It was also strange that, having entered and talked with Touchard, she did not say a word to me herself that she was my mother. She was sitting next to me, and I remember I was even surprised that she didn't talk like that much. She had a bundle with her, and she untied it: it contained six oranges, some gingerbread, and two ordinary French breads. I was offended by the French loaves and answered with a wounded look that here we had very good ""food"" and every day we were given a whole French loaf for tea.","The bell struck clearly and distinctly once every two or even three seconds, but it was definitely not an alarm bell but a pleasant, smooth chime, and suddenly I recognized it : why, it was the old familiar chime of St. Nicholas', the red church across from Touchard's school, that old Moscow church I remember so well, the very ornate one with many cupolas and columns, which had been built during the reign of Tsar Alexei. And it also occurred to me that, since Easter week was just over, tiny new leaves must be shivering on the meager little birches in Touchard's front garden. The bright late afternoon sun was pouring its slanting rays into the classroom, while in the small room next door where Touchard had isolated me a year earlier from the ""sons of counts and senators,"" a visitor was sitting. Yes, I, the boy without a family, was unexpectedly having a visitor, the first visitor I'd had since I'd been at Touchard's school. I recognized my visitor the very second she came in, although I hadn't seen Mother since the time she'd taken me to the village church and the dove had flown across under the cupola. So we sat together in my room and I looked at her in wonderment. Many years later I learned that Versilov was abroad at the time, that she had decided to come to Moscow and had used her meager savings to pay for the journey, I believe secretly from the people with whom she was staying in Versilov's absence—all that just in order to see me. The strange thing was that, although she'd spoken to Touchard and must have told him who she was when she'd arrived, she never mentioned to me the fact that she was my mother. She just sat near me and I remember being rather surprised at how little she had to say. She had brought a little package with her and when she opened it I saw that it contained six oranges, some gingerbread, and two quite ordinary French rolls. I felt offended that she had brought me those two ordinary rolls and prissily told her that we were well fed at school and that every boy got a whole French roll for tea.","The bell rang steadily and distinctly, once every two or three seconds; it was not an alarm bell, however, but a pleasant and melodious chime, and I suddenly recognized that it was a familiar chime; that it was the bell of St. Nikolay's, the red church opposite Touchard's, the old-fashioned Moscow church which I remembered so well, built in the reign of Tsar Alexey Mihalovitch, full of tracery, and with many domes and columns, and that Easter was only just over, and the new-born little green leaves were trembling on the meagre birches in Touchard's front garden. The brilliant evening sun was pouring its slanting rays into our classroom, and in my little room on the left, where a year before Touchard had put me apart that I might not mix with ""counts' and senators' children,"" there was sitting a visitor. Yes, I, who had no relations, had suddenly got a visitor for the first time since I had been at Touchard's. I recognized this visitor as soon as she came in: it was mother, though I had not seen her once since she had taken me to the village church and the dove had flown across the cupola. We were sitting alone together and I watched her strangely. Many years afterwards I learned that being left by Versilov, who had suddenly gone abroad, she had come on her own account to Moscow, paying for the journey out of her small means, and almost by stealth, without the knowledge of the people who had been commissioned to look after her, and she had done this solely to see me. It was strange, too, that when she came in and talked to Touchard, she did not say one word to me of being my mother. She sat beside me, and I remember I wondered at her talking so little. She had a parcel with her and she undid it: in it there turned out to be six oranges, several gingerbread cakes, and two ordinary loaves of French bread. I was offended at the sight of the bread, and with a constrained air I announced that our 'food' was excellent, and that they gave us a whole French loaf for our tea every day."

"– В самом деле, Александр Семенович, как сегодня наш дорогой больной? – осведомился Версилов. Если б я не был так потрясен, то мне первым делом было бы ужасно любопытно проследить и за отношениями Версилова к этому старику, о чем я уже вчера думал. Меня всего более поразило теперь чрезвычайно мягкое и приятное выражение в лице Версилова; в нем было что-то совершенно искреннее. Я как-то уж заметил, кажется, что у Версилова лицо становилось удивительно прекрасным, когда он чуть-чуть только становился простодушным.","- Indeed, Alexander Semenovich, how is our dear patient today? Versilov inquired. If I had not been so shocked, the first thing I would have done was terribly curious to follow Versilov's relationship with this old man, which I was already thinking about yesterday. What struck me most of all now was the extremely mild and pleasant expression on Versilov's face; there was something completely sincere about him. I once noticed that it seems that Versilov's face became surprisingly beautiful when he only became a little ingenuous.","""Well, Doctor, how is our precious patient today?"" Versilov inquired. If I hadn't been so tense, I'd have been anxious to see how Versilov behaved in Makar's presence, something I had tried to imagine before. Now I was particularly struck by Versilov's strangely gentle and warm expression, which I knew was quite unaffected. I believe I've already remarked that Versilov's face was amazingly beautiful whenever he became really sincere.","""Yes, Alexandr Semyonovitch, how is our dear invalid today,"" inquired Versilov. If I had not been so agitated, it would have been most interesting to me to watch Versilov's attitude to this old man; I had wondered about it the day before. What struck me most of all now was the extremely soft and pleasant expression in Versilov's face, there was something perfectly sincere in it. I have noted already, I believe, that Versilov's face became wonderfully beautiful as soon as it became ever so little kindly."

"– Если в нем недостатки, то в нем по крайней мере столько же достоинств, сколько и недостатков! – воскликнул я раз наедине Версилову.","“If it has flaws, then it has at least as many virtues as flaws!” I once exclaimed in private to Versilov.","""Even if he has faults, he has at least as many qualities that make up for them!"" I once pleaded with Versilov when we were alone.","""If he has faults he has at least as many virtues as defects!"" I once exclaimed to Versilov when I was alone with him."
"Разъясню сравнением или, так сказать, уподоблением. Если бы я был русским романистом и имел талант, то непременно брал бы героев моих из русского родового дворянства, потому что лишь в одном этом типе культурных русских людей возможен хоть вид красивого порядка и красивого впечатления, столь необходимого в романе для изящного воздействия на читателя. Говоря так, вовсе не шучу, хотя сам я – совершенно не дворянин, что, впрочем, вам и самим известно. Еще Пушкин наметил сюжеты будущих романов своих в «Преданиях русского семейства», и, поверьте, что тут действительно все, что у нас было доселе красивого. По крайней мере тут все, что было у нас хотя сколько-нибудь завершенного. Я не потому говорю, что так уже безусловно согласен с правильностью и правдивостью красоты этой; но тут, например, уже были законченные формы чести и долга, чего, кроме дворянства, нигде на Руси не только нет законченного, но даже нигде и не начато. Я говорю как человек спокойный и ищущий спокойствия.","Let me explain by comparison, or, so to speak, likening. If I were a Russian novelist and had talent, I would certainly take my heroes from the Russian tribal nobility, because only in this type of cultured Russian people is it possible to have at least a kind of beautiful order and a beautiful impression, which is so necessary in a novel for an elegant impact on the reader. In saying this, I am not joking at all, although I myself am not at all a nobleman, which, by the way, you yourself know. Pushkin also outlined the plots of his future novels in Traditions of the Russian Family, and, believe me, this is really everything that we had hitherto beautiful. At least here is everything that we had at least somewhat completed. I am not saying this because I already unconditionally agree with the correctness and truthfulness of this beauty; but here, for example, there were already completed forms of honor and duty, which, except for the nobility, nowhere in Russia is not only not completed, but nowhere even begun. I speak as a person who is calm and seeking peace.","""Let me try to make clear what I mean by a comparison or rather by a parallel. If I were a talented Russian writer, I would pick my characters from the hereditary gentry because only among that species of educated Russians can be found at least a semblance of harmonious order that could be used to produce an aesthetic effect of beauty so essential in a novel. And I really mean this although, as you well know, I do not belong to the gentry myself. Long ago, speaking of 'the traditions of the Russian family,'[22] Pushkin pointed out the legitimate themes for the Russian novel, and, I assure you, these traditions are the only things of beauty we have had until now or, perhaps I should say, the only things that have taken on a definite form. It is not that I am so fully convinced of the perfection of these family traditions but simply that at least they provide certain definite forms to serve as bases for concepts such as 'honor' and 'duty.' And it so happens that these concepts do not exist in Russia outside the gentry even in embryonic, let alone definite, form. I am saying all this with the utmost detachment as a man whose only concern is harmony.","""I will explain by comparison, or, so to say, by analogy. If I had been a Russian novelist and had talent I should certainly have chosen my heroes from the old nobility, because only in that type of cultivated Russian is it possible to find at least that outward semblance of fine order and aesthetic beauty so necessary in a novel to produce an artistic effect on the reader. I am not joking when I say this, although I am not a nobleman myself, as you are indeed aware. Pushkin selected the subject for his future novels from the 'Traditions of the Russian Family,' and believe me that everything beautiful we have had so far is to be found therein. Everything that has been brought to some sort of perfection, anyway. I don't say this because I am accepting unconditionally the truth and justness of that beauty; but at least there were completely worked out forms of honour and duty which have never existed anywhere in Russia except in the nobility, even in the most rudimentary shape. I speak as a calm man seeking calm."

"– О, ничего, ничего, – перебил я, – я только немножко про Тушара. Вы ему ответили уже из уезда, Татьяна Павловна, через две недели, и резко отказали. Я припоминаю, как он, весь багровый, вошел тогда в нашу классную. Это был очень маленький и очень плотненький французик, лет сорока пяти и действительно парижского происхождения, разумеется из сапожников, но уже с незапамятных времен служивший в Москве на штатном месте, преподавателем французского языка, имевший даже чины, которыми чрезвычайно гордился, – человек глубоко необразованный. А нас, воспитанников, было у него всего человек шесть; из них действительно какой-то племянник московского сенатора, и все мы у него жили совершенно на семейном положении, более под присмотром его супруги, очень манерной дамы, дочери какого-то русского чиновника. Я в эти две недели ужасно важничал перед товарищами, хвастался моим синим сюртуком и папенькой моим Андреем Петровичем, и вопросы их: почему же я Долгорукий, а не Версилов, – совершенно не смущали меня именно потому, что я сам не знал почему.","“Oh, nothing, nothing,” I interrupted, “I'm just talking a little about Touchard. You answered him already from the county, Tatyana Pavlovna, two weeks later, and sharply refused. I remember how he, all purple, entered our classroom then. He was a very small and very plump Frenchman, about forty-five years old and really of Parisian origin, of course from shoemakers, but from time immemorial he had served in Moscow in a regular place, a teacher of French, who even had ranks that he was extremely proud of - a deeply uneducated person. And he had only six of us pupils; one of them was really some kind of nephew of a Moscow senator, and we all lived with him completely in a marital status, more under the supervision of his wife, a very mannered lady, the daughter of some Russian official. During those fortnight I was terribly proud of my comrades, showing off my blue frock coat and my papa Andrei Petrovich, and their questions: why am I Dolgoruky and not Versilov, did not bother me at all, precisely because I myself did not know why.","""Oh, that's nothing, nothing at all, and, anyway, it's not so important what I have to say about Touchard. I remember, though, how purple his face was when he walked into class that day. He was a short, thickset Frenchman of thirty-five or so, a true Parisian he claimed, although, of course, a former bootmaker's apprentice. He had been in Moscow from time immemorial and had taught French ever since his arrival among us. Eventually, he had been given official sanction as an educator, which made him inordinately proud. Otherwise he was a man of crass ignorance. Actually, he had only six boys in his school and it is true that one of them was the nephew of a Moscow senator; and we all lived like a family under the supervision of his wife, a genteel Russian lady, the daughter of some minor government official. ""During the first two weeks, I showed off unrestrainedly to my comrades, boasting of my blue suit and of my papa, Mr. Andrei Versilov. And when they asked me 'How come, then, your name is Dolgoruky and not Versilov?' that didn't bother me at all because I myself had no idea ""how come.'""","""Oh that's nothing, that's nothing,"" I interrupted, ""I am only going to say a little about Touchard.

There were only six of us pupils; among them there actually was a nephew of a Moscow senator; and we all lived like one family under the supervision of his wife, a very affected lady, who was the daughter of a Russian government clerk.

I boasted of my blue overcoat, and my papa, Andrey Petrovitch, and their questions: why I was called Dolgoruky and not Versilov did not embarrass me in the least, since I did not know why."""

"Нет, не незаконнорожденность, которою так дразнили меня у Тушара, не детские грустные годы, не месть и не право протеста явились началом моей «идеи»; вина всему – один мой характер. С двенадцати лет, я думаю, то есть почти с зарождения правильного сознания, я стал не любить людей. Не то что не любить, а как-то стали они мне тяжелы. Слишком мне грустно было иногда самому, в чистые минуты мои, что я никак не могу всего высказать даже близким людям, то есть и мог бы, да не хочу, почему-то удерживаюсь; что я недоверчив, угрюм и несообщителен. Опять-таки, я давно уже заметил в себе черту, чуть не с детства, что слишком часто обвиняю, слишком наклонен к обвинению других; но за этой наклонностью весьма часто немедленно следовала другая мысль, слишком уже для меня тяжелая: «Не я ли сам виноват вместо них?» И как часто я обвинял себя напрасно! Чтоб не разрешать подобных вопросов, я, естественно, искал уединения. К тому же и не находил ничего в обществе людей, как ни старался, а я старался; по крайней мере все мои однолетки, все мои товарищи, все до одного, оказывались ниже меня мыслями; я не помню ни единого исключения.","No, it was not the illegitimacy with which I was so teased at Touchard's, not the sad childhood years, not revenge and not the right to protest, that were the beginning of my ""idea""; blame for everything - one of my character. From the age of twelve, I think, that is, almost from the birth of correct consciousness, I began to dislike people. Not only not to love, but somehow they became difficult for me. I was too sad sometimes myself, in my pure moments, that I can’t express everything even to close people, that is, I could, but I don’t want to, for some reason I hold back; that I am distrustful, sullen and uncommunicative. Again, I have long noticed a trait in myself, almost since childhood, that I blame too often, I am too inclined to blame others; but this inclination was very often immediately followed by another thought, already too heavy for me: ""Am I not to blame myself instead of them?"" And how often have I accused myself in vain! In order not to resolve such questions, I naturally sought solitude. In addition, he did not find anything in the society of people, no matter how hard he tried, but I tried; at least all my peers, all my comrades, every single one, turned out to be lower than me in thoughts; I don't remember a single exception.","No, it was neither my illegitimacy which caused me to be taunted at Touchard's school, nor my gloomy childhood, nor the desire for revenge, nor the need to record my protest that lay at the bottom of my idea—it came to me just because my character is what it is. Since the age of twelve, I believe, when I became fully conscious of things, I have disliked my fellow men. It is not that I actually dislike them, but their presence is somehow painful to me. It makes me feel very depressed sometimes that, at moments when I feel the need for sincerity, I can never express fully what is on my mind, even to the people the closest to me; there's always something that holds me back, that makes me so mistrustful, uncommunicative, and unfriendly. Also, I have noticed in myself, since early childhood, a propensity to suspect others, to blame them for everything. But whenever I suspect others, I immediately ask myself: ""Perhaps it is I who am really guilty and not them?"" And how often have I blamed myself for nothing! It was to avoid such misgiving that I instinctively began to seek self-sufficiency. Besides, I found nothing worthwhile in the company of others, although I tried hard to find something. All the boys of my age I came across were my intellectual inferiors—yes, all of them, I can't think of a single exception.","No, it was not being illegitimate, with which I was so taunted at Touchard's, not my sorrowful childhood, it was not revenge, nor the desire to protest, that was at the bottom of my idea; my character alone was responsible for everything. At twelve years old, I believe, that is almost at the dawn of real consciousness, I began to dislike my fellow-creatures. It was not that I disliked them exactly, but that their presence weighed upon me. I was sometimes in my moments of purest sincerity quite sad that I never could express everything even to my nearest and dearest, that is, I could but will not; for some reason I restrain myself, so that I'm mistrustful, sullen and reserved. Again, I have noticed one characteristic in myself almost from childhood, that I am too ready to find fault, and given to blaming others. But this impulse was often followed at once by another which was very irksome to me: I would ask myself whether it were not my fault rather than theirs. And how often I blamed myself for nothing! To avoid such doubts I naturally sought solitude. Besides, I found nothing in the company of others, however much I tried, and I did try. All the boys of my own age anyway, all my schoolfellows, all, every one of them, turned out to be inferior to me in their ideas. I don't recall one single exception."

"Я спешил домой и – чудное дело – я был очень доволен собою. Так, конечно, не говорят с женщинами, да еще с такими женщинами, – вернее сказать, с такою женщиной, потому что Татьяну Павловну я не считал. Может быть, никак нельзя сказать в лицо женщине такого разряда: «Наплевать на ваши интриги», но я сказал это и был именно этим-то и доволен. Не говоря о другом, я по крайней мере был уверен, что этим тоном затер все смешное, бывшее в моем положении. Но очень много думать об этом было некогда: у меня в голове сидел Крафт. Не то чтоб он меня так уж очень мучил, но все-таки я был потрясен до основания; и даже до того, что обыкновенное человеческое чувство некоторого удовольствия при чужом несчастии, то есть когда кто сломает ногу, потеряет честь, лишится любимого существа и проч., даже обыкновенное это чувство подлого удовлетворения бесследно уступило во мне другому, чрезвычайно цельному ощущению, именно горю, сожалению о Крафте, то есть сожалению ли, не знаю, но какому-то весьма сильному и доброму чувству. И этим я был тоже доволен. Удивительно, как много посторонних мыслей способно мелькнуть в уме, именно когда весь потрясен каким-нибудь колоссальным известием, которое, по-настоящему, должно бы было, кажется, задавить другие чувства и разогнать все посторонние мысли, особенно мелкие; а мелкие-то, напротив, и лезут. Помню еще, что меня всего охватила мало-помалу довольно чувствительная нервная дрожь, которая и продолжалась несколько минут, и даже все время, пока я был дома и объяснялся с Версиловым.","I was in a hurry to get home and - a wonderful thing - I was very pleased with myself. This, of course, is not how one speaks to women, and even to such women - or rather, to such a woman, because I did not consider Tatyana Pavlovna. Maybe it's impossible to say to the face of a woman of this rank: ""I don't give a damn about your intrigues,"" but I said it and was just about that and I was pleased. Without saying anything else, at least I was sure that with this tone I erased everything funny that was in my position. But there was no time to think about it a lot: Kraft was sitting in my head. It's not that he tormented me so much, but still I was shaken to the core; and even to the extent that the ordinary human feeling of a certain pleasure in another's misfortune, that is, when someone breaks a leg, loses honor, loses a loved one, etc., even this ordinary feeling of vile satisfaction has completely given way in me to another, extremely whole feeling, namely grief , unfortunately for Kraft, that is, unfortunately, I don’t know, but some very strong and kind feeling. And I was happy with that too. It is amazing how many extraneous thoughts can flash through the mind, precisely when one is completely shocked by some colossal news, which, really, should, it seems, crush other feelings and disperse all extraneous thoughts, especially small ones; and small ones, on the contrary, climb. I also remember that little by little a rather sensitive nervous trembling seized me, which continued for several minutes, and even all the time while I was at home talking to Versilov.","I hurried home and, strange to say, I was very pleased with myself. Of course, that was no way to speak to ladies, or rather to a lady like that because for me Mrs. Prutkov didn't count. Perhaps I shouldn't have used words like lies and garbage to a lady of Mrs. Akhmakov's class, but now I was glad I had. Apart from anything else, I felt that, by talking to them in that tone, at least I had compensated for being caught in such a ridiculous position. But all these considerations were soon displaced by the thought of Kraft. Although I was not so terribly distressed by his death, it was nevertheless a violent shock to me. Indeed, the very common human habit of reacting with a certain satisfaction when misfortune strikes someone else, such as when another person breaks a leg, is disgraced, loses someone he loves, or something of that sort—even that beastly reaction in me yielded totally to undivided grief, and compassion for Kraft . . . well, if not compassion, at least a strong feeling of respect. And it pleased me to feel that way too. It's amazing, by the way, how many extraneous thoughts can flit through your head when you've just been stunned by some colossal blow, which, it would seem, should have swept away all other thoughts, especially the unimportant ones; but it is precisely the least important thoughts that keep obtruding themselves. I remember also that I was gradually overcome by a hardly perceptible nervous trembling that persisted as I was walking home and then all the time I was talking to Versilov.","I hurried home and—marvellous to relate— I was very well satisfied with myself. That's not the way one talks to women, of course, and to such women too—it would be truer to say such a woman, for I was not considering Tatyana Pavlovna. Perhaps it's out of the question to say to a woman of that class that one spits on her intrigues, but I had said that, and it was just that that I was pleased with. Apart from anything else, I was convinced that by taking this tone I had effaced all that was ridiculous in my position. But I had not time to think much about that: my mind was full of Kraft. Not that the thought of him distressed me very greatly, but yet I was shaken to my inmost depths, and so much so that the ordinary human feeling of pleasure at another man's misfortune—at his breaking his leg or covering himself with disgrace, at his losing some one dear to him, and so on—even this ordinary feeling of mean satisfaction was completely eclipsed by another absolutely single- hearted feeling, a feeling of sorrow, of compassion for Kraft —at least I don't know whether it was compassion, but it was a strong and warm-hearted feeling. And I was glad of this too. It's marvellous how many irrelevant ideas can flash through the mind at the very time when one is shattered by some tremendous piece of news, which one would have thought must overpower all other feelings and banish all extraneous thoughts, especially petty ones; yet petty ones, on the contrary, obtrude themselves. I remember, too, that I was gradually overcome by a quite perceptible nervous shudder, which lasted several minutes, in fact all the time I was at home and talking to Versilov."

"Но горькое, настоящее горькое слово предстоит мне сказать в особенности о сестре моей Лизе. Вот тут – так несчастье, да и что такое все мои неудачи перед ее горькой судьбой! Началось с того, что князь Сергей Петрович не выздоровел и, не дождавшись суда, умер в больнице. Скончался он еще раньше князя Николая Ивановича. Лиза осталась одна, с будущим своим ребенком. Она не плакала и с виду была даже спокойна; сделалась кротка, смиренна; но вся прежняя горячность ее сердца как будто разом куда-то в ней схоронилась. Она смиренно помогала маме, ходила за больным Андреем Петровичем, но стала ужасно неразговорчива, ни на кого и ни на что даже не взглядывала, как будто ей все равно, как будто она лишь проходит мимо. Когда Версилову сделалось легче, она начала много спать. Я приносил было ей книги, но она не читала их; она стала страшно худеть. Я как-то не осмеливался начать утешать ее, хотя часто приходил именно с этим намерением; но в присутствии ее мне как-то не подходилось к ней, да и слов таких не оказывалось у меня, чтобы заговорить об этом. Так продолжалось до одного страшного случая: она упала с нашей лестницы, не высоко, всего с трех ступенек, но она выкинула, и болезнь ее продолжалась почти всю зиму. Теперь она уже встала с постели, но здоровью ее надолго нанесен удар. Она по-прежнему молчалива с нами и задумчива, но с мамой начала понемногу говорить. Все эти последние дни стояло яркое, высокое, весеннее солнце, и я все припоминал про себя то солнечное утро, когда мы, прошлою осенью, шли с нею по улице, оба радуясь и надеясь и любя друг друга. Увы, что сталось после того? Я не жалуюсь, для меня наступила новая жизнь, но она? Ее будущее – загадка, а теперь я и взглянуть на нее не могу без боли.","But I have to say a bitter, real bitter word, especially about my sister Lisa. Here - such misfortune, and what are all my failures before her bitter fate! It began with the fact that Prince Sergei Petrovich did not recover and, without waiting for the trial, died in the hospital. He died even earlier than Prince Nikolai Ivanovich. Lisa was left alone, with her unborn child. She didn't cry and looked even calm; became meek, humble; but all the former ardor of her heart seemed to have been buried somewhere in her at once. She humbly helped her mother, went after the sick Andrey Petrovich, but became terribly taciturn, did not even look at anyone or anything, as if she did not care, as if she was only passing by. When Versilov felt better, she began to sleep a lot. I brought her books, but she did not read them; she became terribly thin. Somehow I did not dare to begin to console her, although I often came with this intention; but in her presence I somehow did not approach her, and besides, I did not have such words to talk about it. This went on until one terrible incident: she fell from our stairs, not high, only three steps, but she threw it away, and her illness continued almost all winter. Now she has already got out of bed, but her health has been damaged for a long time. She is still silent with us and thoughtful, but she began to talk a little with her mother. All these last days there was a bright, high, spring sun, and I kept remembering to myself that sunny morning when, last autumn, we walked down the street with her, both rejoicing and hoping and loving each other. Alas, what happened after that? I'm not complaining, a new life has come for me, but she? Her future is a mystery, and now I can't even look at her without pain.","The one sad sequel that remains for me to tell concerns my sister Lisa. There's real unhappiness for you, and I realize how insignificant my puny troubles are beside her truly bitter fate! First of all, Prince Sergei never recovered and died in the prison hospital before his trial was scheduled to begin. Actually he died before the old Prince Nikolai. And so Lisa was left alone with the child she was expecting. She did not weep and outwardly remained calm and composed. She became gentle and quiet. But her earlier warm impulsiveness seemed to have been sealed somewhere deep inside her. She meekly helped Mother in the house and looked after the convalescing Versilov, but she practically refused to talk and even avoided looking at anyone. She gave the impression that nothing really concerned her, that she was here only temporarily and was about to leave. When Versilov had more or less recovered, she took to sleeping a lot. I tried to bring her books, but she never read them. She grew thinner and thinner. I never dared try to console her, although I often came in determined to do something about her depression. But as soon as I was in her presence, I felt it impossible to get close to her. Nor could I think of any way to start such a conversation. And so it went until a terrible thing happened: she slipped and fell down some steps—not many steps, only three—which was enough for her to have a miscarriage. After that she was ill nearly all winter. Now she is back on her feet, but her health has been permanently damaged. She is still just as silent with us, although she has begun to talk a little to Mother. These past few days, with the bright spring sun shining high in the sky, have kept reminding me of that other sunny morning last fall when Lisa and I were walking down the street, full of joy, of hope, and of love for one another. Alas, what came of it all? Well, personally, I can't complain: a new life has started for me. But Lisa? Her future is an enigma. And today even just to look at her hurts me.","But what is really tragic is what I have to tell of my sister Liza's fate. That is real unhappiness. What are all my failures beside her bitter lot? It began with Prince Sergay Petrovitch's dying in the hospital before his trial. He died before Prince Nikolay Ivanovitch. Liza was left to face the world with her unborn child. She did not shed tears and was outwardly calm, she became gentle and resigned; but all her old fire seemed to have vanished for ever. She helped mother meekly, nursed Andrey Petrovitch through his illness, but became very silent and never seemed to notice anyone or anything, as though nothing mattered to her, as though she were simply passing by. When Versilov was better, she began to sleep a great deal. I used to take her books, but she did not read; she became terribly thin. I did not dare to try to comfort her, though I often went in to her intending to; but in her presence I could not approach her, and I found no words to speak to her. It went on like this till something terrible happened: she fell down our stairs; she did not fall far, only three steps, but it brought on a miscarriage, and she was ill all the rest of the winter. Now she is on her feet again, but her health has been shaken and it will be a long time before she is strong. She is still dreamy and silent with us, but she has begun to talk with mother a little. These last few days we have had bright, clear spring sunshine, and I am all the while inwardly recalling that sunny morning last autumn, when she and I walked along the street, both full of joy and hope and love for one another. Alas, what has happened since then? I don't complain, for me a new life has begun, but for her? Her future is a problem, and I cannot look at her even now without pain."

Well, here it is, since I'll have to tell it sooner or later anyhow.","But what worried me till it was a positive pain (in a side-current, of course, besides my chief torment) was a persistent poisonous impression, persistent as a venomous autumn fly, which one does not think about but which whirls about one, pesters one, and suddenly bites one painfully ; it was only a reminiscence, an incident of which I had never spoken to anyone in the world before. This was what it was, since it seems I must tell this, too."

"Он убежал к себе по лестнице. Конечно, все это могло навести на размышления. Я нарочно не опускаю ни малейшей черты из всей этой тогдашней мелкой бессмыслицы, потому что каждая черточка вошла потом в окончательный букет, где и нашла свое место, в чем и уверится читатель. А что тогда они действительно сбивали меня с толку, то это – правда. Если я был так взволнован и раздражен, то именно заслышав опять в их словах этот столь надоевший мне тон интриг и загадок и напомнивший мне старое. Но продолжаю.","He ran up the stairs to himself. Of course, all this could lead to reflection. I deliberately do not omit the slightest line from all this petty nonsense of that time, because each line later entered the final bouquet, where it found its place, of which the reader will be convinced. And that then they really confused me, it's true. If I was so agitated and irritated, it was precisely when I again heard in their words that tone of intrigue and riddles that bored me so much and reminded me of the old. But I continue.","He ran back upstairs. No doubt, all this should have made me stop and think. I'm deliberately reporting every detail of all that nonsensical sequence of events, for every detail was like one more line added to a drawing whose importance would become apparent only in the final picture. But at the time these details seemed to make no sense whatsoever. And if I became so excited and irritated, it was because I detected behind certain words the implied existence of secrets and intrigues which reminded me of the past and with which I was fed up to the teeth. But let me get on with my story.","He ran back upstairs. Of course all this might well make one reflect. I purposely avoid omitting a single detail in all that petty tomfoolery, for every little detail helped to make up the final situation and had its place in it, a fact of which the reader will be convinced. But that they really did bother me was true. If I was upset and irritated, it was at hearing again in their words that tone of intrigue and mystery of which I was so sick, and which so brought back the past. But to continue."

"Она ушла. Я присел на кровати, холодный пот выступил у меня на лбу, но я чувствовал не испуг: непостижимое для меня и безобразное известие о Ламберте и его происках вовсе, например, не наполнило меня ужасом, судя по страху, может быть безотчетному, с которым я вспоминал и в болезни и в первые дни выздоровления о моей с ним встрече в тогдашнюю ночь. Напротив, в то смутное первое мгновение на кровати, сейчас по уходе Настасьи Егоровны, я даже и не останавливался на Ламберте, но… меня захватила пуще всего весть о ней, о разрыве ее с Бьорингом и о счастье ее в свете, о праздниках, об успехе, о «блеске». «Блестят-с», – слышалось мне словцо Настасьи Егоровны. И я вдруг почувствовал, что не мог с моими силами отбиться от этого круговорота, хоть я и сумел скрепиться, молчать и не расспрашивать Настасью Егоровну после ее чудных рассказов! Непомерная жажда этой жизни, их жизнь захватила весь мой дух и… и еще какая-то другая сладостная жажда, которую я ощущал до счастья и до мучительной боли. Мысли же мои как-то вертелись, но я давал им вертеться. «Что тут рассуждать!» – чувствовалось мне. «Однако даже мама смолчала мне, что Ламберт приходил, – думал я бессвязными отрывками, – это Версилов велел молчать… Умру, а не спрошу Версилова о Ламберте!» – «Версилов, – мелькало у меня опять, – Версилов и Ламберт, о, сколько у них нового! Молодец Версилов! Напугал немца – Бьоринга, тем письмом; он оклеветал ее; la calomnie… il en reste toujours quelque chose,[87] и придворный немец испугался скандала – ха-ха… вот ей и урок!» – «Ламберт… уж не проник ли и к ней Ламберт? Еще бы! Отчего ж ей и с ним не „связаться“?»","She left. I sat down on the bed, cold sweat beaded on my forehead, but I did not feel fright: the incomprehensible and ugly news about Lambert and his intrigues did not fill me with horror at all, judging by the fear, perhaps unconscious, with which I I recalled, both in my illness and in the first days of my recovery, my meeting with him that night. On the contrary, in that vague first moment on the bed, now after the departure of Nastasya Egorovna, I did not even dwell on Lambert, but ... success, about ""brilliance"". “Shine, sir,” I heard the word of Nastasya Yegorovna. And I suddenly felt that with my strength I could not fight off this cycle, although I managed to hold myself together, keep silent and not question Nastasya Yegorovna after her wonderful stories! An exorbitant thirst for this life, their life captured my whole spirit and ... and some other sweet thirst that I felt to the point of happiness and excruciating pain. My thoughts were somehow spinning, but I let them spin. ""What is there to talk about!"" I felt. “However, even my mother didn’t tell me that Lambert came,” I thought in incoherent fragments, “it was Versilov who ordered me to be silent ... I’ll die and not ask Versilov about Lambert!” “Versilov,” I flashed again, “Versilov and Lambert, oh, how much new stuff they have! Well done Versilov! Frightened the German - Bjoring, with that letter; he slandered her; la calomnie… il en reste toujours quelque chose,[87] and the German courtier was frightened of the scandal – ha ha… that’s a lesson for her!” “Lambert... hasn't Lambert got into her too? Still would! Why shouldn’t she “get in touch” with him?”",". ."" She left. I sat up in bed. Cold sweat beaded my forehead, but it was not fear. The unexplainable and distasteful news about Lambert and his intrigues didn't fill me with terror as might have been expected, judging from the almost irrational horror with which, during my sickness and convalescence, I remembered our last meeting. In fact, during that confused moment when I sat up in bed after Daria had left, I didn't even give much thought to Lambert. I was much too absorbed by what the woman had told me about her— about her break with Bjoring, her success in society, at all those balls. ... I suddenly knew that, try as hard as I might, I'd never succeed in making a clean break from that whirlpool, notwithstanding my obstinate silence and my refusal to ask Daria to elaborate on the wonderful things she'd told me. I felt an irresistible craving for that Me, for their life, such an overwhelming craving that I could feel nothing else. And, along with it, successively sweet and bitter waves of joy and of excruciating torment swept over me. And in my head fragments of thoughts were spinning around, but I didn't mind: ""What good would it do to try to reason? "" I felt. ""Still, even Mother hid from me the fact that Lambert had come to the house,"" flashed through my mind. ""It must be Versilov who told her not to say anything about it. . . . Well, I'll die before I ask Versilov about Lambert!"" ""Versilov,"" flashed through my mind, ""Versilov and Lambert! Ah, they have so much to tell to each other! It was great of Versilov, though, to manage to scare away that German oaf Bjoring with his letter! He did libel her all right, and that's la calomnie . . . il en teste toujours quelque chose, and that courtly German became too frightened of a scandal! Ha-ha-ha! So let it be a good lesson to her! But I wonder whether Lambert hasn't managed to get to her too? Why, of course, why shouldn't she get involved in some plot with him too?""","She went away. I sat on the edge of the bed, a cold sweat came out on my forehead, but I did not feel terror: the incredible and grotesque news about Lambert and his machinations did not, for instance, fill me with horror in the least, as might have been expected from the dread, perhaps unaccountable, with which during my illness and the early days of my convalescence I recalled my meeting with him on that night. On the contrary, in that first moment of confusion, as I sat on the bed after Darya Onisimovna had gone, my mind did not dwell on Lambert, but … more than all I thought about the news of HER, of her rupture with Büring, and of her success in society, of her fêtes, of her triumphs, of the ""stir"" she was making. ""She's making quite a stir,"" Darya Onisimovna's phrase, was ringing in my ears. And I suddenly felt that I had not the strength to struggle out of that whirlpool; I had known how to control myself, to hold my tongue and not to question Darya Onisimovna after her tales of marvels! An overwhelming thirst for that life, for THEIR life, took possession of my whole spirit and … and another blissful thirst which I felt as a keen joy and an intense pain. My thoughts were in a whirl; but I let them whirl… . ""Why be reasonable,"" I felt. ""Even mother kept Lambert's coming a secret,"" I thought, in incoherent snatches. ""Versilov must have told her not to speak of it… . I would rather die than ask Versilov about Lambert!"" ""Versilov,"" the thought flashed upon me again. ""Versilov and Lambert. Oh, what a lot that's new among them! Bravo, Versilov! He frightened the German Büring with that letter; he libelled her, la calomnie … il en reste tonjours quelque chose, and the German courtier was afraid of the scandal. Ha! ha! it's a lesson for her."" ""Lambert … surely Lambert hasn't found his way to her? To be sure he has! Why shouldn't she have an intrigue with him?"""
"Теперь позвольте мне самому, и уже без вашей просьбы, изложить вам откровенно несколько мыслей и впечатлений, пришедших мне в ум и душу при чтении столь откровенных записок ваших. Да, я согласен с Андреем Петровичем, что за вас и за уединенную юность вашу действительно можно было опасаться. И таких, как вы, юношей немало, и способности их действительно всегда угрожают развиться к худшему – или в молчалинское подобострастие, или в затаенное желание беспорядка. Но это желание беспорядка – и даже чаще всего – происходит, может быть, от затаенной жажды порядка и «благообразия» (употребляю ваше слово)? Юность чиста уже потому, что она – юность. Может быть, в этих, столь ранних, порывах безумия заключается именно эта жажда порядка и это искание истины, и кто ж виноват, что некоторые современные молодые люди видят эту истину и этот порядок в таких глупеньких и смешных вещах, что не понимаешь даже, как могли они им поверить! Замечу кстати, что прежде, в довольно недавнее прошлое, всего лишь поколение назад, этих интересных юношей можно было и не столь жалеть, ибо в те времена они почти всегда кончали тем, что с успехом примыкали впоследствии к нашему высшему культурному слою и сливались с ним в одно целое. И если, например, и сознавали, в начале дороги, всю беспорядочность и случайность свою, все отсутствие благородного в их хотя бы семейной обстановке, отсутствие родового предания и красивых законченных форм, то тем даже и лучше было, ибо уже сознательно добивались того потом сами и тем самым приучались его ценить. Ныне уже несколько иначе – именно потому, что примкнуть почти не к чему.","Now allow me myself, and now without your request, to tell you frankly a few thoughts and impressions that came into my mind and soul when reading your so frank notes. Yes, I agree with Andrey Petrovich that one could really fear for you and for your solitary youth. And there are many young men like you, and their abilities really always threaten to develop for the worse - either into Silent subservience, or into a hidden desire for disorder. But this desire for disorder - and even most often - comes, perhaps, from a hidden thirst for order and ""beauty"" (I use your word)? Youth is pure only because it is youth. Perhaps it is precisely this thirst for order and this search for truth that lies in these so early outbursts of madness, and who is to blame that some modern young people see this truth and this order in such stupid and ridiculous things that they don’t even understand how could they believe them! By the way, I note that before, in the fairly recent past, just a generation ago, these interesting young men could not be so sorry, because in those days they almost always ended up successfully adjoining our highest cultural stratum and merging with it. into one whole. And if, for example, they were aware, at the beginning of the road, of all their disorder and randomness, all the absence of the noble in their at least family environment, the absence of tribal tradition and beautiful finished forms, then it was even better, because they themselves consciously achieved it later and thereby learned to appreciate it. Now it is somewhat different - precisely because there is almost nothing to join.","""Now, although you haven't asked me to, allow me on my own initiative to share with you a few thoughts and feelings that came to me as I read your Notes, so striking in their frankness. Yes, I think Mr. Ver-silov was right in saying that, because of your young years spent in solitude, you could be dangerous. There are many adolescents like you whose natural endowments may turn into either a servile conformity or an unreasoned predilection for disorder. But this predilection for disorder stems, in most cases perhaps, from what is really an unconscious longing for order or, to use your own word, for 'beauty.' Youth is pure just because it is youth. Possibly, in its immature and crazy impulses, there is a longing for order and a search for truth. But who is to blame if some members of the present young generation believe they have discovered truth in notions so ridiculous that it seems incredible for anyone to accept them? I'd like to remark here that only one generation ago, which is quite recently after all, there was no need to pity such daring young people because in the end they always rejoined our educated ruling class and eventually blended into it to form an indistinguishable whole. And if, early in life, they became conscious of the lurking disorderliness and unfairness around them, the breach of dignity in the parental home, the lack of solid family traditions and of a beautiful, fully evolved way of life—it was all to the good because, after having questioned the value of these traditions, they returned to them in full awareness and were in a better position to understand and appreciate them. But today the situation is quite different: there is almost nothing for the young dissidents to go back to.","""Now allow me, though you have not requested it, to give you frankly some thoughts and impressions that have occurred to my mind while perusing your extremely candid 'autobiography.' Yes, I agree with Andrey Petrovitch, that one might well feel anxiety about you and your SOLITARY YOUTH. And there are more than a few lads like you, and there really is always a danger of their talents leading them astray, either into secret sensuality, or a latent desire for lawlessness. But this thirst for lawlessness proceeds most frequently, perhaps, from a latent craving for discipline and 'seemliness'—(I am using your own words). Youth is pure, just because it is youth. Perhaps in these precocious impulses of madness, there lie concealed a craving for discipline and a search for truth, and whose fault is it that some young people of to-day see that truth and that discipline in such stupid and ridiculous things, that one cannot imagine how they can believe in them! I may mention, by the way, that in the recent past, a generation ago at most, such interesting lads were not so much to be pitied, for in those days they almost always ended by successfully attaching themselves to our most highly cultivated class and merging into it and even if they did at the onset recognise their own lack of order and consistency, the lack of nobility even in their family surroundings, the lack of an ancestral tradition, and of fine finished forms of social life, it was a gain for them, for they consciously strove towards all this and thereby learned to prize it. Nowadays the position is somewhat different, for there is scarcely anything the young can attach themselves to."

"Затем все, что последовало, совершилось так быстро, что я не только не мог сообразиться, но даже и чуть-чуть приготовиться, как вести себя. Если б я мог приготовиться, я бы, конечно, вел себя иначе! Но я потерялся, как маленький мальчик. Я было бросился в ее комнаты, но лакей на дороге сказал мне, что Катерина Николаевна уже вышла и садится в карету. Я бросился сломя голову на парадную лестницу. Катерина Николаевна сходила вниз, в своей шубе, и рядом с ней шел или, лучше сказать, вел ее высокий стройный офицер, в форме, без шинели, с саблей; шинель нес за ним лакей. Это был барон, полковник, лет тридцати пяти, щеголеватый тип офицера, сухощавый, с немного слишком продолговатым лицом, с рыжеватыми усами и даже ресницами. Лицо его было хоть и совсем некрасиво, но с резкой и вызывающей физиономией. Я описываю наскоро, как заметил в ту минуту. Перед тем же я его никогда не видал. Я бежал за ними по лестнице без шляпы и без шубы. Катерина Николаевна меня заметила первая и быстро прошептала ему что-то. Он повернул было голову, но тотчас же кивнул слуге и швейцару. Слуга шагнул было ко мне у самой уже выходной двери, но я отвел его рукой и выскочил вслед за ними на крыльцо. Бьоринг усаживал Катерину Николавну в карету.","Then everything that followed happened so quickly that I not only could not think, but even slightly prepare how to behave. If I could prepare, I would certainly behave differently! But I got lost like a little boy. I was about to rush into her rooms, but a footman on the road told me that Katerina Nikolaevna had already left and was getting into the carriage. I rushed headlong up the front stairs. Katerina Nikolaevna went downstairs, in her fur coat, and next to her walked, or, rather, led her a tall, slender officer, in uniform, without an overcoat, with a saber; the overcoat carried the footman behind him. He was a baron, a colonel, about thirty-five years old, a dapper type of officer, lean, with a slightly too long face, with a reddish mustache and even eyelashes. His face was, though quite ugly, but with a sharp and defiant physiognomy. I describe hastily, as I noticed at that moment. Before that, I had never seen him. I ran after them up the stairs without a hat or a fur coat. Katerina Nikolaevna noticed me first and quickly whispered something to him. He turned his head, but immediately nodded to the servant and porter. The servant was about to step towards me at the very exit door, but I took him away with my hand and jumped out after them onto the porch. Bjoring was putting Katerina Nikolaevna into the carriage.","After that things happened so quickly that not only didn't I have time to make sense out of them but I never even got a chance to prepare myself to face what lay ahead. If I'd been prepared, of course I'd have behaved quite differently. But I lost my head just like a little boy. First I ran to her suite, but the lackey told me that Mrs. Akhmakov had gone downstairs and was about to drive off in her carriage. I rushed toward the main staircase and saw her descending the stairs. She was wearing her fur coat and was accompanied by—or rather was walking arm in arm with—a tall, straight-backed, forbidding-looking officer in full uniform, including sword, while a lackey followed behind, carrying the officer's greatcoat. This was the baron. He was a colonel of thirty-five or so, a dry, spare man, the dashing officer type, with a rather long face, a reddish mustache, and even reddish eyelashes. And although his face was by no means handsome, there was something striking and imperious in it. I have described him sketchily, the way I took him in at first sight. I'd never met him before. I ran after them downstairs, coatless and hatless. Katerina saw me coming first and whispered something to her companion. He turned his head slightly and made a sign to the lackey and the doorman. The lackey came toward me as I was about to open the outside door, but I pushed him aside and rushed out after them just as Bjoring was helping Katerina into the carriage. ""Mrs. Akhmakov!","All that followed upon this happened so quickly that I had no time to reflect, or even to consider in the least how to behave. If I had had time to consider, I should certainly have behaved differently! But I lost my head like a small boy. I was rushing towards her room, but on the way a footman informed me that Katerina Nikolaevna had already gone downstairs and was getting into her carriage. I rushed headlong down the front staircase. Katerina Nikolaevna was descending the stairs, in her fur coat, and beside her—or rather arm-in-arm with her—walked a tall and severe-looking officer, wearing a uniform and a sword, and followed by a footman carrying his great-coat. This was the baron, who was a colonel of five-and-thirty, a typical smart officer, thin, with rather too long a face, ginger moustache and even eyelashes of the same colour. Though his face was quite ugly, it had a resolute and defiant expression. I describe him briefly, as I saw him at that moment. I had never seen him before. I ran down the stairs after them without a hat or coat. Katerina Nikolaevna was the first to notice me, and she hurriedly whispered something to her companion. He slightly turned his head and then made a sign to the footman and the hall-porter. The footman took a step towards me at the front door, but I pushed him away and rushed after them out on the steps. Büring was assisting Katerina Nikolaevna into the carriage."

"Если я и сказал, что все семейство всегда было в сборе, то кроме меня, разумеется. Я был как выброшенный и чуть не с самого рождения помещен в чужих людях. Но тут не было никакого особенного намерения, а просто как-то так почему-то вышло. Родив меня, мать была еще молода и хороша, а стало быть, нужна ему, а крикун ребенок, разумеется, был всему помехою, особенно в путешествиях. Вот почему и случилось, что до двадцатого года я почти не видал моей матери, кроме двух-трех случаев мельком. Произошло не от чувств матери, а от высокомерия к людям Версилова.","If I said that the whole family was always in the collection, then except for me, of course. I was as if thrown out and almost from birth placed in strangers. But there was no special intention here, but it just somehow happened for some reason.

I had been cast out almost from the moment I was born and had to live with strangers. But this was not done for any special reason, it just happened that way.

So that was why, until my nineteenth year, I hardly ever saw my mother, except on two or three brief occasions. And this was not due to my mother's lack of feeling for me, but rather to Ver-silov's haughty disregard for the feelings of other people.","I have said that the family were always together, but I mean except for me, of course.

"– У вас вырвалось сегодня одно драгоценное слово, – продолжал я в восторге. – Как могли вы только выговорить предо мной, «что рассчитывали на мою пылкость»? Ну пусть вы святая и признаетесь даже в этом, потому что вообразили в себе какую-то вину и хотели себя казнить… Хотя, впрочем, никакой вины не было, потому что если и было что, то от вас все свято! Но все-таки вы могли не сказать именно этого слова, этого выражения!.. Такое неестественное даже чистосердечие показывает лишь высшее ваше целомудрие, уважение ко мне, веру в меня, – бессвязно восклицал я. – О, не краснейте, не краснейте!.. И кто, кто мог клеветать и говорить, что вы – страстная женщина? О, простите: я вижу мучительное выражение на вашем лице; простите исступленному подростку его неуклюжие слова! Да и в словах ли, в выражениях ли теперь дело? Не выше ли вы всех выражений?.. Версилов раз говорил, что Отелло не для того убил Дездемону, а потом убил себя, что ревновал, а потому, что у него отняли его идеал!.. Я это понял, потому что и мне сегодня возвратили мой идеал!","“One precious word slipped out of you today,” I continued in delight. - How could you only say before me, ""that you counted on my ardor""? Well, let you be a saint and even admit it, because you imagined some kind of guilt in yourself and wanted to execute yourself ... Although, however, there was no guilt, because if there was anything, then everything is holy from you! But all the same, you might not have said exactly this word, this expression!.. Such unnatural candor, even, shows only your highest chastity, respect for me, faith in me,” I exclaimed incoherently. - Oh, do not blush, do not blush! .. And who, who could slander and say that you are a passionate woman? Oh, sorry: I see an agonized expression on your face; forgive the frantic teenager for his clumsy words! And is it in words, in expressions, is it now? Are you beyond all expressions?..

I understood this, because today I returned my ideal!","""You said something yourself that I found beautiful,"" I went on enthusiastically. ""How could you say to my face that you were reckoning on my 'impulsiveness'? Indeed, you are a saint, even if you admit those calculations of yours because you imagine you're guilty of something or other and want to punish yourself for it. . . . But, in fact, you're guilty of nothing and, even if there were something you could reproach yourself for, it would be something saintly since it comes from you, saint that you are. Still, you didn't have to use that particular word. Such frankness is not even natural; it only reveals your supreme purity and shows your respect for me and your trust in me! "" I was aware that my incoherent exclaiming was ridiculous but went on. "" Oh, don't blush, please don't! I can't imagine how some people can say that you're a woman swayed by passions! Oh, forgive me, for I see the pained expression on your face, so please forgive this over enthusiastic adolescent for his clumsy way of saying what he feels. But are words and phrases really so important now? Aren't you above anything that can be conveyed by words? Versilov once said that the reason Othello killed Desdemona and then himself was not jealousy but because he had been robbed of his ideal. ... I understood today how true that is because I have been given back my ideal!""","""You let slip to-day a priceless sentence,"" I went on ecstatically. ""How could you to my face utter the words; 'I reckoned on your impulsiveness'? Well, granted you are a saint, and confess even that, because you imagined yourself guilty in some way and want to punish yourself … though there was no fault of any sort, for, if there had been, from you everything is holy! But yet you need not have uttered just that word, that expression! … Such unnatural candour only shows your lofty purity, your respect for me, your faith in me!"" I cried incoherently. "" Oh, do not blush, do not blush! … And how, how could anyone slander you, and say that you are a woman of violent passions? Oh, forgive me : I see a look of anguish on your face; forgive a frenzied boy his clumsy words! Besides, do words matter now? Are you not above all words? … Versilov said once that Othello did not kill Desdemona and afterwards himself because he was jealous, but because he had been robbed of his ideal… . I understand that, because to-day my ideal has been restored to me!"""

"– Я об этом думал, – сказал он твердо. – Я весь день сегодня решался и наконец решил. Я ждал только вас; я поеду. Знаете ли, что я никогда в моей жизни не брал ни копейки у князя Николая Ивановича. Он добр к нашему семейству и даже… принимал участие, но собственно я, я лично, я никогда не брал денег. Но теперь я решился… Заметьте, наш род Сокольских старше, чем род князя Николая Ивановича: они – младшая линия, даже побочная, почти спорная… Наши предки были в вражде. В начале петровской реформы мой прапрадед, тоже Петр, был и остался раскольником и скитался в костромских лесах. Этот князь Петр во второй раз тоже на недворянке был женат… Вот тогда-то и выдвинулись эти другие Сокольские, но я… о чем же я это говорю?","“I thought about it,” he said firmly. I've been trying all day today and I finally made up my mind. I was waiting only for you; I will go. Do you know that I have never in my life taken a penny from Prince Nikolai Ivanovich. He is kind to our family and even... took part, but actually I, I personally, I never took money. But now I've made up my mind... Notice that our Sokolsky family is older than the family of Prince Nikolai Ivanovich: they are a junior line, even a sideline, almost controversial... Our ancestors were at enmity. At the beginning of the Petrine reform, my great-great-grandfather, also Peter, was and remained a schismatic and wandered in the Kostroma forests. This Prince Peter was also married for the second time to a non-noblewoman ... It was then that these other Sokolskys came to the fore, but I ... what am I talking about?","""I was thinking of that,"" he said in a determined tone. ""I've been trying to make up my mind all day and finally I've decided. I was only waiting for you. I will go to him. You know, I've never yet asked Prince Nikolai for anything: He's always been kindly disposed toward our branch of the family, but I personally have never received any favors from him. However, now I've decided to accept. ... I want you to note, by the way, that our branch of the Princes Sokolsky is older than his; he belongs to a lesser branch, a sort of offshoot, in fact, hardly recognized. . . . There was a feud between our ancestors. At the beginning of the changes introduced by Peter the Great, my greatgrandfather—also a Peter—remained an Old Believer and went off to live in the Kostroma forests. That Prince Peter was also married (his second marriage) to a woman of lowly birth. And that's when the second branch of the Sokolskys came to the fore. . . . But what am I talking about?""","""I have thought of that,"" he said resolutely. ""I have been making up my mind all day and at last I have decided. I have only been waiting for you; I will go. Do you know I have never in my life borrowed a farthing from Prince Nikolay Ivanitch. He is well disposed to our family and even … and has come to their assistance, but I, I personally, have never borrowed money from him. But now I am determined to. Our family, you may note, is an older branch of the Sokolskys than Prince Nikolay Ivanitch's; they are a younger branch, collaterals, in fact, hardly recognized… . There was a feud between our ancestors. At the beginning of the reforms of Peter the Great, my great-grandfather, whose name was Peter too, remained an Old Believer, and was a wanderer in the forest of Kostroma.

Затем продолжаю о главном.,Then I continue about the main thing.,And now back to really important things.,Now I will go on with my story.
"Мне приснился совершенно неожиданный для меня сон, потому что я никогда не видал таких. В Дрездене, в галерее, есть картина Клода Лоррена, по каталогу – «Асис и Галатея»; я же называл ее всегда «Золотым веком», сам не знаю почему. Я уж и прежде ее видел, а теперь, дня три назад, еще раз мимоездом заметил. Эта-то картина мне и приснилась, но не как картина, а как будто какая-то быль. Я, впрочем, не знаю, что мне именно снилось: точно так, как и в картине, – уголок Греческого архипелага, причем и время как бы перешло за три тысячи лет назад; голубые, ласковые волны, острова и скалы, цветущее прибрежье, волшебная панорама вдали, заходящее зовущее солнце – словами не передашь. Тут запомнило свою колыбель европейское человечество, и мысль о том как бы наполнила и мою душу родною любовью. Здесь был земной рай человечества: боги сходили с небес и роднились с людьми… О, тут жили прекрасные люди! Они вставали и засыпали счастливые и невинные; луга и рощи наполнялись их песнями и веселыми криками; великий избыток непочатых сил уходил в любовь и в простодушную радость. Солнце обливало их теплом и светом, радуясь на своих прекрасных детей… Чудный сон, высокое заблуждение человечества! Золотой век – мечта самая невероятная из всех, какие были, но за которую люди отдавали всю жизнь свою и все свои силы, для которой умирали и убивались пророки, без которой народы не хотят жить и не могут даже и умереть! И все это ощущение я как будто прожил в этом сне; скалы, и море, и косые лучи заходящего солнца – все это я как будто еще видел, когда проснулся и раскрыл глаза, буквально омоченные слезами. Помню, что я был рад. Ощущение счастья, мне еще неизвестного, прошло сквозь сердце мое, даже до боли; это была всечеловеческая любовь. Был уже полный вечер; в окно моей маленькой комнаты, сквозь зелень стоявших на окне цветов, прорывался пук косых лучей и обливал меня светом. И вот, друг мой, и вот – это заходящее солнце первого дня европейского человечества, которое я видел во сне моем, обратилось для меня тотчас, как я проснулся, наяву, в заходящее солнце последнего дня европейского человечества! Тогда особенно слышался над Европой как бы звон похоронного колокола. Я не про войну лишь одну говорю и не про Тюильри; я и без того знал, что все прейдет, весь лик европейского старого мира – рано ли, поздно ли; но я, как русский европеец, не мог допустить того. Да, они только что сожгли тогда Тюильри… О, не беспокойся, я знаю, что это было «логично», и слишком понимаю неотразимость текущей идеи, но, как носитель высшей русской культурной мысли, я не мог допустить того, ибо высшая русская мысль есть всепримирение идей. И кто бы мог понять тогда такую мысль во всем мире: я скитался один. Не про себя лично я говорю – я про русскую мысль говорю. Там была брань и логика; там француз был всего только французом, а немец всего только немцем, и это с наибольшим напряжением, чем во всю их историю; стало быть, никогда француз не повредил столько Франции, а немец своей Германии, как в то именно время! Тогда во всей Европе не было ни одного европейца! Только я один, между всеми петролейщиками, мог сказать им в глаза, что их Тюильри – ошибка; и только я один, между всеми консерваторами-отмстителями, мог сказать отмстителям, что Тюильри – хоть и преступление, но все же логика. И это потому, мой мальчик, что один я, как русский, был тогда в Европе единственным европейцем. Я не про себя говорю – я про всю русскую мысль говорю. Я скитался, мой друг, я скитался и твердо знал, что мне надо молчать и скитаться. Но все же мне было грустно. Я, мальчик мой, не могу не уважать моего дворянства. Ты, кажется, смеешься?","I had a dream that was completely unexpected for me, because I had never seen such. In Dresden, in the gallery, there is a painting by Claude Lorrain, according to the catalog - ""Asis and Galatea""; I always called it the ""Golden Age"", I don't know why. I had already seen her before, but now, three days ago, I once again noticed her in passing. It was this picture that I dreamed about, but not as a picture, but as if some kind of true story. However, I don’t know what exactly I dreamed about: just like in the picture, a corner of the Greek archipelago, and time, as it were, passed over three thousand years ago; blue, gentle waves, islands and rocks, flowering coast, a magical panorama in the distance, the setting sun calling - you can’t convey in words. Here European humanity remembered its cradle, and the thought of that, as it were, filled my soul with native love. Here was the earthly paradise of mankind: the gods descended from heaven and became related to people ... Oh, wonderful people lived here! They rose and fell asleep happy and innocent; meadows and groves were filled with their songs and cheerful cries; a great surplus of untapped strength went into love and ingenuous joy. The sun showered them with warmth and light, rejoicing at its beautiful children... A wonderful dream, a lofty delusion of humanity! The Golden Age is the most incredible dream of all that was, but for which people gave their whole lives and all their strength, for which the prophets died and were killed, without which the peoples do not want to live and cannot even die! And all this feeling I seemed to have lived in this dream; rocks, and the sea, and the slanting rays of the setting sun - all this I seemed to still see when I woke up and opened my eyes, literally wet with tears. I remember that I was glad. A feeling of happiness, still unknown to me, passed through my heart, even to the point of pain; it was universal love. It was already full evening; through the window of my small room, through the green of the flowers standing on the window, a bunch of oblique rays broke through and showered me with light. And so, my friend, and behold - this setting sun of the first day of European humanity, which I saw in my dream, turned for me immediately, as I woke up, in reality, into the setting sun of the last day of European humanity! Then especially heard over Europe, as it were, the ringing of a funeral bell. I am not talking about the war, only one, and not about the Tuileries; I already knew that everything would pass away, the whole face of the European old world - sooner or later; but I, as a Russian European, could not allow that. Yes, they just burned down the Tuileries then... Oh, don't worry, I know that it was ""logical"", and I understand too well the irresistibility of the current idea, but, as a bearer of the highest Russian cultural thought, I could not allow this, because the highest Russian thought there is a universal reconciliation of ideas. And who could understand then such a thought in the whole world: I wandered alone. I'm not talking about myself personally - I'm talking about Russian thought. There was scolding and logic; there the Frenchman was only a Frenchman, and the German only a German, and this with more tension than in their entire history; therefore, the Frenchman never damaged so much France, and the German his Germany, as at that particular time! At that time there was not a single European in all of Europe! Only I alone, among all the petroleum workers, could tell them to their face that their Tuileries was a mistake; and only I alone, among all conservative avengers, could tell the avengers that the Tuileries, although a crime, is still logic. And this is because, my boy, that I alone, as a Russian, was then the only European in Europe. I'm not talking about myself - I'm talking about the whole of Russian thought. I wandered, my friend, I wandered and knew for sure that I had to be silent and wander. But still, I was sad. I, my boy, cannot but respect my nobility. Do you seem to be laughing?","""I dreamed something completely unexpected. I'd never had such dreams before. In the Dresden museum there's a Claude Lorrain painting listed in the catalogue as 'Acis and Galatea,' but I somehow always called it 'The Golden Age.' I'd seen it before and had noticed it again three days earlier while walking through the museum. It was that painting that I saw in my dream but as a reality, not as a picture. I'm not quite sure, however, exactly what I dreamed about, but I saw a corner of the Greek Archipelago and time seemed to have moved back three thousand years or so. Blue, gentle waves, isles, rocky cliffs, a flowery coastline, the caressing sun setting in the background—the whole formed a fairy-tale scenery that words cannot convey. This was the cradle of Europe and that thought filled me with love and kindred feelings. This was the earthly paradise where gods descended from the heavens to mingle with men. . . . And what a beautiful race of men lived here! They rose in the morning and went to sleep at night, happy and innocent; the woods and meadows resounded with their joyful cries and songs; the great surplus of their untapped energy was spent on love and simple joys. The sun lavished its light and warmth on them, watching lovingly over its beautiful children. ... A wonderful dream, the noble delusion of mankind! The Golden Age is an aspiration completely beyond the reach of men, but it's one to which they have devoted all their energies, for which they have willingly died, in the name of which they have killed their prophets, and without which they have no wish to live and do not even know how to die! ""And in that dream it was as though I myself had known all these feelings of mankind as I looked at the cliffs, the sea, and the slanting rays of the setting sun. And when I woke up, my eyes were actually wet with tears. I remember how elated I was. A feeling of happiness such as I'd never known before penetrated my heart so violently that it even hurt—it was the sensation of universal love encompassing all mankind. It was already late by then and penetrating through the flowers and the greenery outside my window was a cluster of slanting sunrays sprinkling me with light. And suddenly, my boy, the sun that in the dream was setting on the first day of European civilization turned, upon my awakening, into the sun setting on the last day of our era! Indeed, just then, things seemed to have reached a point when the death knell was about to resound all over Europe. Oh, it was not just the war that was going on, nor what had happened at the Tuileries — I'd always known that all that was fated to go, that the whole old European world would vanish sooner or later. But, being a Russian and a European myself, I couldn't accept the thought. . . . Besides, they'd only just set fire to the Tuileries. . . . ""Oh, you needn't worry, I knew that their act was logical' and I understood all too well how unassailable the current theories appeared to them. But, being the bearer of Russian culture and thought, I couldn't accept these theories because Russia's supreme intellectual contribution lies in the general reconciliation of all existing ideas. But who else in the world could possibly understand such a thought at that time? I was all alone. I'm not talking about myself, but about the Russian idea. Over there, there was nothing but logic and bickering. A Frenchman was just a Frenchman, a German nothing but a German, and more intensely so than ever before in history. And never had a Frenchman harmed France or a German Germany more than right then. At that moment, you couldn't find a single European in the whole of Europe! I was the only one who could've told those arsonists that setting fire to the Tuileries was wrong. And I was also the only one who could've explained to the conservatives, bent on revenge, that, although burning the Tuileries was a mistake, it was nevertheless a logical act. And I was in that position, my dear boy, because, being a Russian in Europe, I was the only European there. Understand, though, I'm not talking just of myself, I'm talking about the whole Russian way of thinking. I myself was roaming around from place to place, saying nothing, for I knew I had to remain silent and just wander around. But it did sadden me. You know, my boy, I can't help feeling respect for the Russian gentry of which I'm part. . . . That makes you laugh, I suppose, doesn't it?""","""I dreamed a dream that was a complete surprise to me, for I had never had any dreams of the sort before.

I don't know exactly what I did dream though: it was just as in the picture, a corner of the Grecian Archipelago, and time seemed to have gone back three thousand years; blue smiling waves, isles and rocks, a flowery shore, a view like fairyland in the distance, a setting sun that seemed calling to me—there's no putting it into words. It seemed a memory of the cradle of Europe, and that thought seemed to fill my soul, too, with a love as of kinship. Here was the earthly paradise of man: the gods came down from the skies, and were of one kin with men… . Oh, here lived a splendid race! they rose up and lay down to sleep happy and innocent; the woods and meadows were filled with their songs and merry voices. Their wealth of untouched strength was spent on simple-hearted joy and love. The sun bathed them in warmth and light, rejoicing in her splendid children … Marvellous dream, lofty error of mankind! The Golden Age is the most unlikely of all the dreams that have been, but for it men have given up their life and all their strength, for the sake of it prophets have died and been slain, without it the peoples will not live and cannot die, and the feeling of all this I lived through, as it were, in that dream; rocks and sea, and the slanting rays of the setting sun—all this I seemed still to see when I woke up and opened my eyes, literally wet with tears. I remembered that I was glad, a sensation of happiness I had never known before thrilled my heart till it ached; it was the love of all humanity. It was by then quite evening; through the green of the flowers that stood in the windows of my little room, broke slanting rays that flooded me with light. And then, my dear—that setting sun of the first day of European civilization which I had seen in my dream was transformed for me at once on waking, into the setting sun of the last day of civilization! One seemed to hear the death-knell ringing over Europe in those days. I am not speaking of the war and the Tuileries; apart from that, I knew that all would pass away, the whole face of the old world of Europe— sooner or later, but I, as a Russian European, could not accept it. Yes, they had only just burnt the Tuileries… . ""Oh, rest assured, I know it was logical; I quite understand the irresistible force of the idea, but as the bearer of the idea of the highest Russian culture, I could not accept it, for the highest Russian thought is the reconciliation of ideas, and who in the whole world could understand such a thought at that time; I was a solitary wanderer. I am not speaking of myself personally—it's the Russian idea I'm speaking of. There all was strife and logic; there the Frenchman was nothing but a Frenchman, the German was nothing but a German, and this more intensely so than at any time in their whole history; consequently never had the Frenchman done so much harm to France, or the German to Germany, as just at that time! In those days in all Europe there was not one European: I alone among all the vitriol-throwers could have told them to their face that their Tuileries was a mistake. And I alone among the avenging reactionists could have told them that the Tuileries, although a crime, was none the less logical. And that, my boy, was because I, as a Russian, was the ONLY EUROPEAN in Russia. I am not talking of myself, I am talking of the whole Russian idea. I have been a wanderer, my boy. I was a wanderer, and I knew well that I must wander and be silent. But yet I was sad. I cannot help respecting my position as a Russian nobleman. My boy, I believe you are laughing?"""

"А может быть и то, что Ламберт совсем не хитрил с этою девицею, даже ни минуты, а так-таки и брякнул с первого слова: «Mademoiselle, или оставайтесь старой девой, или становитесь княгиней и миллионщицей: вот документ, а я его у подростка выкраду и вам передам… за вексель от вас в тридцать тысяч». Я даже думаю, что именно так и было. О, он всех считал такими же подлецами, как сам; повторяю, в нем было какое-то простодушие подлеца, невинность подлеца… Так или этак, а весьма может быть, что и Анна Андреевна, даже и при таком приступе, не смутилась ни на минуту, а отлично сумела сдержать себя и выслушать шантажника, говорившего своим слогом – и все из «широкости». Ну, разумеется, сперва покраснела немножко, а там скрепилась и выслушала.

I even think that's exactly what happened. Oh, he considered everyone the same scoundrels as himself; I repeat, there was in him some kind of innocence of a scoundrel, the innocence of a scoundrel ...

There exists such and such a document. I'll steal it from that boy and give it to you for an IOU for thirty thousand rubles."" Actually this is probably exactly what happened. For he couldn't help assuming that everybody was just as rotten as himself: he had, as I said before, that peculiar simplicity, almost innocence, that is sometimes found in out-and-out scoundrels. But, however he broached the subject, it isn't likely that, even with a cruder approach, Anna would have hesitated: she must have quickly gained full possession of herself, heard him out, and understood the proposition made to her in blackmailer's language. After all, she too possessed that typical Russian ""breadth""! Oh, of course, she may have blushed at first, but then she must have made the necessary effort and listened to what he had to offer. Ah, I can just imagine that unapproachable, truly dignified, and highly intelligent girl working hand in hand with a guttersnipe like Lambert! . . . Well, there must be something wrong with such high intelligences. Yes, the Russian intellectual is eager to embrace the broadest possible range of ideas, especially the female intellectual, and particularly when it suits the circumstances!

I turned around and was struck by his expression. He was rather pale at that moment, but his eyes were glowing and intense. There was great strength in his look. And happiness too.","Versilov repeated behind me, meaning, ""Isn't it like?"" I glanced at him and was struck by the expression of his face. He was rather pale, but there was a glowing and intense look in his eyes which seemed shining with happiness and strength. I had never seen such an expression on his face."

"Князь Сережа (то есть князь Сергей Петрович, так и буду его называть) привез меня в щегольской пролетке на свою квартиру, и первым делом я удивился великолепию его квартиры. То есть не то что великолепию, но квартира эта была как у самых «порядочных людей»: высокие, большие, светлые комнаты (я видел две, остальные были притворены) и мебель – опять-таки хоть и не Бог знает какой Versailles[47] или Renaissance,[48] но мягкая, комфортная, обильная, на самую широкую ногу; ковры, резное дерево и статуэтки. Между тем про них все говорили, что они нищие, что у них ровно ничего. Я мельком слышал, однако, что этот князь и везде задавал пыли, где только мог, – и здесь, и в Москве, и в прежнем полку, и в Париже, – что он даже игрок и что у него долги. На мне был перемятый сюртук, и вдобавок в пуху, потому что я так и спал не раздевшись, а рубашке приходился уже четвертый день. Впрочем, сюртук мой был еще не совсем скверен, но, попав к князю, я вспомнил о предложении Версилова сшить себе платье.","Prince Seryozha (that is, Prince Sergei Petrovich, that's what I will call him) brought me to his apartment in a smart cab, and the first thing I was surprised at was the magnificence of his apartment. That is, not only splendor, but this apartment was like that of the most “decent people”: high, large, bright rooms (I saw two, the rest were pretended) and furniture - again, though God knows what Versailles[47] or Renaissance,[48] but soft, comfortable, plentiful, to the widest leg; carpets, carved wood and figurines. Meanwhile, everyone said about them that they were beggars, that they had absolutely nothing. I heard in passing, however, that this prince was throwing dust everywhere he could, both here, and in Moscow, and in the former regiment, and in Paris, that he was even a player and that he had debts. I was wearing a rumpled frock coat, and in addition in fluff, because I still slept without undressing, and the shirt was already the fourth day. However, my coat was still not quite ugly, but when I got to the prince, I remembered Versilov's proposal to sew a dress for myself.","Prince Sergei Sokolsky—or Sergei as I shall refer to him henceforward—drove me in an elegant light carriage to his apartment, which surprised me by its sumptuousness. Well, perhaps to call it sumptuous might be an exaggeration, but it was the ""right"" sort of a place with large, light, high-ceilinged rooms (I saw two of them, the doors leading to the others were closed), elegantly and lavishly furnished with comfortable and stylish furniture, although it might not have been the best Versailles, Renaissance, or what not. Also there were expensive rugs, carved wood, and pieces of sculpture. It struck me as strange because I'd always heard that this branch of the Princes Sokolsky was penniless. But, on the other hand, this Prince Sergei was reputed to be a show-off who liked to play the role of a young millionaire whenever he could, here as well as in Moscow, in Paris as well as among the officers of his former regiment. Indeed, I'd also vaguely heard that he was a gambler and had debts. I myself had on a crumpled jacket, which was, moreover, covered with fluff because I had slept in it on Vasin's sofa, and it was the fourth day that I was wearing the same shirt. Although my jacket wasn't badly cut, as I entered Sergei's apartment now, I somehow remembered Ver-silov's suggestion that I order myself another suit.","Prince Sergay as I shall call him (that is Prince Sergay Petrovitch Sokolsky) drove me in a smart victoria to his flat, and my first impression was one of surprise at its magnificence. Not that it was really magnificent, but it was a flat such as ""well-to-do people"" live in, light, large, lofty rooms (I saw two of them) and the furniture well padded, comfortable, abundant and of the best— though I've no idea whether it was in the Versailles or Renaissance style. There were rugs, carvings, and statuettes, though everybody said that the Sokolskys were beggars, and had absolutely nothing. I had heard, however, that Prince Sergay had cut a dash wherever he could, here, in Moscow, in his old regiment and in Paris, that he was a gambler and that he had debts. My coat was crumpled and covered with fluff, too, because I had slept in it without undressing, and this was the fourth day I had worn my shirt. My coat was not really shabby but when I went into Prince Sergay's, I recalled Versilov's suggestion that I should have a new suit."
"Значит, имеют точные сведения, подумал я, но не расспрашивал. Хоть не описываю чувств моих, но вся эта загадка, несмотря на всю бодрость мою, вдруг опять навалилась камнем на мое сердце. Мы все уселись в гостиной за круглым столом, вокруг мамы. О, как мне нравилось тогда быть с нею и смотреть на нее! Мама вдруг попросила, чтоб я прочел что-нибудь из Евангелия. Я прочел главу от Луки. Она не плакала и даже была не очень печальна, но никогда лицо ее не казалось мне столь осмысленным духовно. В тихом взгляде ее светилась идея, но никак я не мог заметить, чтоб она чего-нибудь ждала в тревоге. Разговор не умолкал; стали многое припоминать о покойном, много рассказала о нем и Татьяна Павловна, чего я совершенно не знал прежде. И вообще, если б записать, то нашлось бы много любопытного. Даже Татьяна Павловна совсем как бы изменила свой обычный вид: была очень тиха, очень ласкова, а главное, тоже очень спокойна, хотя и много говорила, чтобы развлечь маму. Но одну подробность я слишком запомнил: мама сидела на диване, а влево от дивана, на особом круглом столике, лежал как бы приготовленный к чему-то образ – древняя икона, без ризы, но лишь с венчиками на главах святых, которых изображено было двое. Образ этот принадлежал Макару Ивановичу – об этом я знал и знал тоже, что покойник никогда не расставался с этою иконой и считал ее чудотворною. Татьяна Павловна несколько раз на нее взглядывала.","So they have accurate information, I thought, but did not ask. Although I do not describe my feelings, this whole riddle, in spite of all my cheerfulness, suddenly again fell like a stone on my heart. We all sat down in the living room at a round table, around my mother. Oh, how I liked then to be with her and look at her! Mom suddenly asked me to read something from the Gospel. I read the chapter from Luke. She did not cry and was not even very sad, but her face had never seemed to me so spiritually meaningful. An idea shone in her quiet glance, but I could not see that she was waiting for something in alarm. The conversation did not stop; they began to recall a lot about the deceased, Tatyana Pavlovna also told a lot about him, which I did not know at all before. And in general, if written down, there would be a lot of interesting things. Even Tatyana Pavlovna seemed to have completely changed her usual appearance: she was very quiet, very affectionate, and, most importantly, also very calm, although she talked a lot to amuse her mother. But I remember one detail too much: my mother was sitting on the sofa, and to the left of the sofa, on a special round table, lay an image, as it were, prepared for something - an ancient icon, without a chasuble, but only with rims on the heads of saints, of which there were two . This image belonged to Makar Ivanovich - I knew about this and I also knew that the deceased never parted with this icon and considered it miraculous. Tatyana Pavlovna glanced at her several times.","So they obviously must've heard something that made them so certain. I didn't ask any further questions. And although I didn't intend to describe my changing feelings, I must say that, despite my cheerful, confident mood, I suddenly felt oppressed by the atmosphere of secrecy. We all sat down around Mother in the living room, and I remember how good it felt to look at her. At one point she asked me to read something from the Bible and I read a chapter from St. Luke. Mother didn't cry. Nor for that matter did she look too sad. Actually, what struck me was the spiritual radiance of her face. Her gentle eyes were dreamy and she didn't look like someone waiting with apprehension for something to happen. We never stopped talking about Makar, and Mrs. Prutkov told many things about him I'd never heard before, much of which would be very interesting for its own sake if I retold it here. I was quite struck by how different Mrs. Prutkov was from her usual self : she was very quiet, very gentle, and above all uncharacteristically calm, although she talked a lot to distract Mother. There is one detail that engraved itself so strongly on my memory that I must mention it: Mother was sitting on the sofa and close by, to her left, stood a little round table on which an icon lay, apparently put there for some special purpose. It was an ancient icon without a selling. It represented two saints with little halos around their heads. I knew that the icon had belonged to Makar and also that he had never parted with it, believing it to be miracle-working. Mrs. Prutkov kept glancing at it again and again.","""So they must have heard something positive,"" I thought, but I didn't ask any question. Though I'm not going to describe my feelings, all this mystery began to weigh like a stone upon my heart again in spite of my confident mood. We all settled down in the drawing-room, near mother, at the round table. Oh, how I liked being with her then, and looking at her! Mother suddenly asked me to read something out of the Gospel. I read a chapter from St. Luke. She did not weep, and was not even very sorrowful, but her face had never seemed to me so full of spiritual meaning. There was the light of thought in her gentle eyes, but I could not trace in them any sign that she expected something with apprehension. The conversation never flagged; we recalled many reminiscences of Makar Ivanovitch; Tatyana Pavlovna, too, told us many things about him of which I had no idea before. And, in fact, it would make an interesting chapter if it were all written down. Even Tatyana Pavlovna wore quite a different air from usual: she was very gentle, very affectionate, and, what is more, also very quiet, though she talked a good deal to distract mother's mind. But one detail I remember well: mother was sitting on the sofa, and on a special round table on her left there lay, apparently put there for some purpose, a plain antique ikon, with halos on the heads of the saints, of which there were two. This ikon had belonged to Makar Ivanovitch—I knew that, and knew also that the old man had never parted from it, and looked upon it with superstitious reverence. Tatyana Pavlovna glanced at it several times."
"Я ставил стоя, молча, нахмурясь и стиснув зубы. На третьей же ставке Зерщиков громко объявил zero, не выходившее весь день. Мне отсчитали сто сорок полуимпериалов золотом.

At the third bet, Zershchikov loudly announced zero, which had not come out all day. One hundred and forty half-imperials in gold were counted out to me.

"Не обвините в славянофильстве; это – я лишь так, от мизантропии, ибо тяжело на сердце! Ныне, с недавнего времени, происходит у нас нечто совсем обратное изображенному выше. Уже не сор прирастает к высшему слою людей, а напротив, от красивого типа отрываются, с веселою торопливостью, куски и комки и сбиваются в одну кучу с беспорядствующими и завидующими. И далеко не единичный случай, что самые отцы и родоначальники бывших культурных семейств смеются уже над тем, во что, может быть, еще хотели бы верить их дети. Мало того, с увлечением не скрывают от детей своих свою алчную радость о внезапном праве на бесчестье, которое они вдруг из чего-то вывели целою массой. Не про истинных прогрессистов я говорю, милейший Аркадий Макарович, а про тот лишь сброд, оказавшийся бесчисленным, про который сказано: «Grattes le russe et vous verrez le tartare».[150] И поверьте, что истинных либералов, истинных и великодушных друзей человечества у нас вовсе не так много, как это нам вдруг показалось.","Don't accuse me of Slavophilism; it's just me, from misanthropy, because it's hard on the heart! Now, since recently, we have something completely opposite to that depicted above. It is no longer rubbish that adheres to the highest stratum of people, but, on the contrary, pieces and lumps are torn off from a beautiful type, with cheerful haste, and stray into one heap with the disorderly and envious. And it is by no means an isolated case that the very fathers and ancestors of the former cultured families laugh at what, perhaps, their children would still like to believe. Moreover, they enthusiastically do not hide from their children their greedy joy about the sudden right to dishonor, which they suddenly brought out of something in a whole mass. I am not talking about true progressives, my dearest Arkady Makarovich, but only about that rabble, which turned out to be innumerable, about which it is said: “Grattes le russe et vous verrez le tartare.”[150] And believe that we do not have as many true liberals, true and generous friends of mankind as it suddenly seemed to us.","Don't accuse me of being a Slavophile. And if I sound misanthropic, it's simply because it all depresses me so much. ""Indeed, recently the process has been reversed: no longer is human jetsam latching itself on to our elite; instead, whole batches of our best people are tearing themselves away from it and lightheart-edly joining the roving packs of the disorderly and the envious. Moreover, it is no longer so rare to find fathers and heads of our culture-bearing families mocking and ridiculing values that their children may still have been happy to believe in. Worse than that, they don't even bother to hide from their children their great delight at their sudden discovery of the right to dishonor that will enable them to satisfy their greed, a right based on a certain species of reasoning accepted wholesale by so many. You must understand, Arkady, that I'm not talking about genuine believers in progress but about our rabble, which now appears so numerous, of whom it has been said 'Grattez le Russe et vous trouvez le Tartare.' And take my word for it, there are nowhere near as many true liberals and genuine humanitarians among us as we have been led to believe.","""Don't accuse me of Slavophilism; I only say this from misanthropy, for my heart is heavy! Something is happening to us to-day and in the recent past, the very opposite of what I have imagined above.

And there have been many instances of fathers and heads of what have been cultured families, laughing at what their children perhaps would have liked to believe in. What is more, they eagerly display to their children their spiteful pleasure at the sudden licence to be dishonest, which they have all at once deduced, wholesale, from something. I am not speaking of the true progressives, dear Arkady Makarovitch, but only of that rabble, so numerous it seems, of whom it has been said 'grattez le Russe et vous verrez le Tatare,' and believe me there are by no means so many true liberals, true and noble friends of humanity among us, as we have imagined."

"Мне вдруг подумалось, что Васин уже знает о Крафте и, может быть, во сто раз больше меня; точно так и вышло. Васин тотчас же и обязательно мне сообщил все подробности, без большого, впрочем, жару; я заключил, что он утомился, да и впрямь так было. Он сам был утром у Крафта. Крафт застрелился из револьвера (из того самого) вчера, уже в полные сумерки, что явствовало из его дневника. Последняя отметка сделана была в дневнике перед самым выстрелом, и он замечает в ней, что пишет почти в темноте, едва разбирая буквы; свечку же зажечь не хочет, боясь оставить после себя пожар. «А зажечь, чтоб пред выстрелом опять потушить, как и жизнь мою, не хочу», – странно прибавил он чуть не в последней строчке. Этот предсмертный дневник свой он затеял еще третьего дня, только что воротился в Петербург, еще до визита к Дергачеву; после же моего ухода вписывал в него каждые четверть часа; самые же последние три-четыре заметки записывал в каждые пять минут. Я громко удивился тому, что Васин, имея этот дневник столько времени перед глазами (ему дали прочитать его), не снял копии, тем более что было не более листа кругом и заметки все короткие, – «хотя бы последнюю-то страничку!» Васин с улыбкою заметил мне, что он и так помнит, притом заметки без всякой системы, о всем, что на ум взбредет. Я стал было убеждать, что это-то в данном случае и драгоценно, но бросил и стал приставать, чтоб он что-нибудь припомнил, и он припомнил несколько строк, примерно за час до выстрела, о том, «что его знобит»; «что он, чтобы согреться, думал было выпить рюмку, но мысль, что от этого, пожалуй, сильнее кровоизлияние, остановила его». «Все почти в этом роде», – заключил Васин.","It suddenly occurred to me that Vassin already knew about Kraft, and perhaps a hundred times more than I did; that's exactly what happened. Vassin immediately and without fail told me all the details, without much heat, however; I concluded that he was tired, and indeed he was. He himself was at Kraft's in the morning. Kraft shot himself with a revolver (from the same one) yesterday, already at full twilight, which was clear from his diary. The last note was made in the diary just before the shot, and he notices in it that he writes almost in the dark, barely making out the letters; he does not want to light a candle, being afraid to leave a fire behind. “But I don’t want to light it up so that I can extinguish it again before the shot, just like my life,” he added strangely, almost in the last line. He started this dying diary of his on the third day, he had just returned to Petersburg, even before his visit to Dergachev; after my departure, he entered into it every quarter of an hour; the very last three or four notes I wrote down every five minutes. I was loudly surprised that Vassin, having had this diary in front of his eyes for so long (he was allowed to read it), did not make a copy, especially since there was no more than a sheet around and the notes were all short, “at least the last page!” Vassin remarked to me with a smile that he already remembered, and notes without any system, about everything that came into his mind. I began to convince him that this was something precious in this case, but I stopped and began to pester him to remember something, and he remembered a few lines, about an hour before the shot, about ""that he was shivering""; “that he thought to drink a glass to warm himself, but the thought that this, perhaps, made the hemorrhage worse, stopped him.” “Everything is almost like this,” Vasin concluded.","It had suddenly occurred to me that Vasin must have already heard about Kraft and must know much more than I did about the whole business. He did, indeed, and he told me all the facts but quite unemo-tionally. He looked tired. He'd been to Kraft's apartment in the morning. Kraft had used the gun I'd seen there. He'd shot himself when it was already quite dark—that was obvious from the last entry in his diary, made just before he pulled the trigger. In it he mentioned that he was writing in almost complete darkness, hardly able to see what he was writing, since he didn't want to light a candle lest it should set fire to something after he was dead. "" Nor do I want to light it now only to blow it out just before I blow out my life. "" This strange remark was almost the last line of the entry. He'd begun this diary only three days before his death, as soon as he had returned to Petersburg just before he'd been to Dergachev's. After I'd left him, he'd written in it every quarter of an hour and, during the last forty-five minutes, there was one entry every five minutes. I told Vasin that it was quite beyond me why he, Vasin, had failed to copy the diary when it had been given to him to read; he'd had plenty of time since it was only a few pages long and the entries were brief. ""You couldVc; copied at least the last page,"" I said. Vasin smiled and told me that he remembered it by heart anyway. Besides, he said, Kraft seemed to have jotted down at random thoughts that came to his mind. I tried to argue that this was precisely what made it so interesting but soon gave up and, instead, asked him to try to repeat to me verbatim some of the lines Kraft had written an hour before shooting himself. Vasin then recited entire lines such as ""I have chills"" and ""I thought of drinking a glass of brandy to warm myself up but I'd better not as it might intensify the bleeding."" "". . . that kind of thing,"" Vasin said in conclusion.","It suddenly struck me that Vassin would know already about Kraft, and perhaps know a hundred times more than I did; and so it proved to be. Vassin immediately informed me of all the facts with great precision but with no great warmth; I concluded that he was very tired, and so indeed he was. He had been at Kraft's himself in the morning. Kraft had shot himself with a revolver (that same revolver) after dark, as was shown by his diary. The last entry in the diary was made just before the fatal shot, and in it he mentioned that he was writing almost in the dark and hardly able to distinguish the letters, that he did not want to light a candle for fear that it should set fire to something when he was dead. "" And I don't want to light it and then, before shooting, put it out like my life,"" he added strangely, almost the last words. This diary he had begun three days before his death, immediately on his return to Petersburg, before his visit to Dergatchev's. After I had gone away he had written something in it every quarter of an hour; the last three or four entries were made at intervals of five minutes. I expressed aloud my surprise that though Vassin had had this diary so long in his hands (it had been given him to read), he had not made a copy of it, especially as it was not more than a sheet or so and all the entries were short. ""You might at least have copied the last page!"" Vassin observed with a smile that he remembered it as it was; moreover, that the entries were quite disconnected, about anything that came into his mind. I was about to protest that this was just what was precious in this case, but without going into that I began instead to insist on his recalling some of it, and he did recall a few sentences—for instance, an hour before he shot himself, ""That he was chilly,"" ""That he thought of drinking a glass of wine to warm himself, but had been deterred by the idea that it might cause an increase in the flow of blood."" ""It was almost all that sort of thing,"" Vassin remarked in conclusion."

"Анна Андреевна, выйдя давеча от меня во гневе, еще не потеряла духа. Надобно передать, что она еще с утра посылала к Ламберту, затем послала к нему еще раз, и так как Ламберта все не оказывалось дома, то послала наконец своего брата искать его. Бедная, видя мое сопротивление, возложила на Ламберта и на влияние его на меня свою последнюю надежду. Она ждала Ламберта с нетерпением и только дивилась, что он, не отходивший от нее и юливший около нее до сегодня, вдруг ее совсем бросил и сам исчез. Увы! ей и в голову не могло зайти, что Ламберт, обладая теперь документом, принял уже совсем другие решения, а потому, конечно, скрывается и даже нарочно от нее прячется.","Anna Andreyevna, having left me just now in anger, has not yet lost her spirit. It must be said that since morning she sent to Lambert, then sent to him again, and since Lambert was still not at home, she finally sent her brother to look for him. The poor woman, seeing my resistance, placed her last hope in Lambert and his influence on me. She waited impatiently for Lambert and only marveled that he, who had not left her side and hovered around her until today, suddenly abandoned her completely and disappeared himself. Alas! it could not even enter her head that Lambert, now in possession of the document, had already made completely different decisions, and therefore, of course, he was hiding and even hiding from her on purpose.","When Anna had left my room in a rage, she hadn't by any means given up all hope. I must mention that she'd already sent for Lambert earlier. Later she sent for him again, but then, since he still wasn't home, she dispatched her brother in search of the Frenchman. The poor girl, faced with my resistance, was now, as a last resort, reckoning on Lambert to exert his influence on me. She was waiting for Lambert anxiously and was surprised that he, who had been turning around her until recently, had suddenly vanished into thin air. Alas, it certainly couldn't have occurred to her that Lambert, who was now in possession of the document, had switched his plans and was deliberately avoiding her to the point of going into hiding.","When Anna Andreyevna had gone out of my room in a rage, that morning, she had not yet lost heart; I must mention that she had already, that morning, sent to Lambert, then she sent to him again, and as Lambert appeared to be still absent from home, she finally dispatched her brother to look for him. In face of my opposition the poor girl was resting her last hopes on Lambert and his influence on me; she expected him with impatience, and only wondered that after hovering round her and never leaving her side till that day, he should now have suddenly deserted her and vanished. Alas! she could not possibly have imagined that Lambert, being now in possession of the document, had made entirely different plans, and so, of course, was keeping out of the way and hiding from her on purpose."

"– Макар Иванович прежде всего – не мужик, а дворовый человек, – произнес он с большою охотою, – бывший дворовый человек и бывший слуга, родившийся слугою и от слуги. Дворовые и слуги чрезвычайно много разделяли интересов частной, духовной и умственной жизни своих господ в былое время. Заметь, что Макар Иванович до сих пор всего больше интересуется событиями из господской и высшей жизни. Ты еще не знаешь, до какой степени интересуется он иными событиями в России за последнее время. Знаешь ли, что он великий политик? Его медом не корми, а расскажи, где кто воюет и будем ли мы воевать. В прежнее время я доводил его подобными разговорами до блаженства. Науку уважает очень и из всех наук любит больше астрономию. При всем том выработал в себе нечто столь независимое, чего уже ни за что в нем не передвинешь. Убеждения есть, и твердые, и довольно ясные… и истинные. При совершенном невежестве, он вдруг способен изумить неожиданным знакомством с иными понятиями, которых бы в нем и не предполагал. Хвалит пустыню с восторгом, но ни в пустыню, ни в монастырь ни за что не пойдет, потому что в высшей степени «бродяга», как мило назвал его Александр Семенович, на которого ты напрасно, мимоходом сказать, сердишься. Ну что ж еще, наконец: несколько художник, много своих слов, но есть и не свои. Несколько хром в логическом изложении, подчас очень отвлеченен; с порывами сентиментальности, но совершенно народной, или, лучше сказать, с порывами того самого общенародного умиления, которое так широко вносит народ наш в свое религиозное чувство. Про чистосердечие и незлобивость его опускаю: не нам с тобой начинать на эту тему…","“Makar Ivanovich is, first of all, not a peasant, but a house serf,” he said with great eagerness, “a former yard man and a former servant, born a servant and from a servant.” Courtyard and servants shared the interests of the private, spiritual and mental life of their masters in the old days to an extremely large extent. Note that Makar Ivanovich is still most interested in events from the master's and higher life. You still don't know to what extent he is interested in other events in Russia lately. Do you know that he is a great politician? Do not feed him honey, but tell us where someone is fighting and whether we will fight. In the old days, I drove him to bliss with such talk. He respects science very much, and of all the sciences, he loves astronomy the most. For all that, he has developed in himself something so independent that you can’t move it for anything. There are convictions, both firm and quite clear ... and true. With complete ignorance, he is suddenly able to amaze with an unexpected acquaintance with other concepts that he would not have imagined in him. He praises the desert with delight, but he won’t go to the desert or to the monastery for anything, because he is a “tramp” in the highest degree, as Alexander Semenovich sweetly called him, with whom you needlessly, in passing, are angry. Well, what else, finally: a few artists, a lot of his own words, but there are not his own. Somewhat lame in logical presentation, sometimes very abstract; with outbursts of sentimentality, but completely popular, or, better, with outbursts of that same universal tenderness that our people so widely introduces into their religious feeling. I omit him about sincerity and gentleness: it’s not for you and me to start on this topic ...","""First of all, you must understand that Makar Dolgoruky is no peasant,"" Versilov answered, obviously quite willing to talk now. "" He is a former house servant born of house servants. In the old days, serfs employed as house servants used to share many of the interests of their musters, intellectual as well as spiritual. Note that, to this day, Makar is very interested in the life of his former masters and of the upper class in general. You have no idea how closely he follows certain recent developments on the Russian scene. And, do you know, he has a keen sense of politics. He'll forget about eating if you start telling him who is at war with whom and whether Russia is likely to go to war too. Long ago I used to delight him with such conversations. He also has great respect for science and, of all the sciences, his favorite is astronomy. But, with all that, he's worked out for himself a view of the world so independent that you'd never be able to budge him from it. He does, indeed, have convictions: some he stubbornly clings to; others, fairly clear-headed . . . and some, very true. Despite his complete lack of education, he's capable on occasion of surprising people by his strange grasp of certain subjects that no one would possibly have suspected in him. And although he keeps praising the hermitage and life in the wild, he'll never go and live in the desert or in a monastery because he's an out-and-out nomad, a real tramp as the doctor called him so aptly—and, by the way, there's really no reason for you to be irritated by our doctor. Well, finally, Makar is something of an artist: he has coined many of his own expressions and words and also uses well others that he has picked up. He's a bit lame when it comes to logical exposition, and at times he indulges in excessive generalizations and fits of sentimentality, but this is a common trait among simple folk, or, to be more accurate, these are outbursts of exaltation that constitute such an important share in the religious manifestations of our people. As to his purity of heart and the absence of malice in him, I won't mention them, it's not fit for the two of us to discuss that subject. . . .""","""Makar Ivanovitch is above all not a peasant but a house-serf,"" he pronounced with great readiness, ""who has been a servant, born a servant, and of servants. The house-serfs and servants used to share a very great deal in the interests of their masters' private, spiritual, and intellectual life in the past. Note that to this day Makar Ivanovitch is most interested in the life of the gentry and upper class. You don't know yet how much interest he takes in recent events in Russia. Do you know that he is a great politician? Don't feed him on honey, but tell him where anyone is fighting and whether we are going to fight. In old days I used to delight him by such accounts. He has the greatest respect for science, and of all sciences is fondest of astronomy. At the same time he has worked out for himself something so independent that nothing you could do would shake it. He has convictions, firm, fairly clear … and genuine. Though he's so absolutely uneducated he is often able to astound one by his surprising knowledge of certain ideas which one would never have expected to find in him. He extols the 'desert' with enthusiasm, but nothing would induce him to retire to the desert or enter a monastery, because he is above all things a 'tramp,' as he was so charmingly called by Alexandr Semyonovitch (and by the way there's no need for you to be angry with him). Well, and what more? He's something of an artist, many of his sayings are his own, though some are not. He's somewhat halting in his logic, and at times too abstract; he has moods of sentimentality, but of a thoroughly peasant kind, or rather moods of that tenderness universally found among peasants, which the people introduce so freely into their religious feelings. As for his purity of heart and freedom from malice, I won't discuss them; it's not for you and me to begin upon that… ."""

"Крафт прежде где-то служил, а вместе с тем и помогал покойному Андроникову (за вознаграждение от него) в ведении иных частных дел, которыми тот постоянно занимался сверх своей службы. Для меня важно было уже то, что Крафту, вследствие особенной близости его с Андрониковым, могло быть многое известно из того, что так интересовало меня. Но я знал от Марьи Ивановны, жены Николая Семеновича, у которого я прожил столько лет, когда ходил в гимназию, – и которая была родной племянницей, воспитанницей и любимицей Андроникова, что Крафту даже «поручено» передать мне нечто. Я уже ждал его целый месяц.","Kraft used to serve somewhere, and at the same time he helped the late Andronikov (for a fee from him) in the conduct of other private affairs, in which he was constantly engaged in excess of his service. For me, it was already important that Kraft, due to his special closeness to Andronikov, could know a lot of what interested me so much. But I knew from Marya Ivanovna, the wife of Nikolai Semyonovich, with whom I lived for so many years when I went to the gymnasium - and who was Andronikov’s own niece, pupil and favorite, that Kraft was even “instructed” to convey something to me. I've been waiting for it for a whole month.","Kraft held some sort of government job and also did occasional work for die late Andronikov, who had a private law practice besides his official government post. Kraft was important to me because his special relations with Andronikov put him in a position to know many things that interested me very much. But now there was something more urgent involved. Maria, the wife of Nikolai Semyonovich, in whose house I had lived while attending high school in Moscow, happened to be Andronikov's former ward and his favorite niece. And it was she who had told me that Kraft had a special message for me. I had been expecting him for a whole month now.","Kraft had been somewhere in the service, and at the same time had been a paid assistant of Andronikov's in the management of the private business which the deceased gentleman had always carried on in addition to his official duties. What mattered to me was, that from his close association with Andronikov, Kraft might well know a great deal of what interested me. But Marie Ivanovna, the wife of Nikolay Semyonovitch, with whom I had boarded so many years while I was at the grammar school in Moscow, was a favourite niece of Andronikov and was brought up by him, and from her I learnt that Kraft had actually been ""commissioned"" to give me something.

Moreover, she makes the most unexpected objections. Note again, that I am far from calling her a fool; on the contrary, she has intelligence of a sort, and even remarkable intelligence; though perhaps you will not believe in her intelligence… ."""

"– Позволь, Дергачев, это не так надо ставить, – опять подхватил с нетерпением Тихомиров (Дергачев тотчас же уступил). – Ввиду того, что Крафт сделал серьезные изучения, вывел выводы на основании физиологии, которые признает математическими, и убил, может быть, года два на свою идею (которую я бы принял преспокойно a priori), ввиду этого, то есть ввиду тревог и серьезности Крафта, это дело представляется в виде феномена. Из всего выходит вопрос, который Крафт понимать не может, и вот этим и надо заняться, то есть непониманием Крафта, потому что это феномен. Надо разрешить, принадлежит ли этот феномен клинике, как единичный случай, или есть свойство, которое может нормально повторяться в других; это интересно в видах уже общего дела. Про Россию я Крафту поверю и даже скажу, что, пожалуй, и рад; если б эта идея была всеми усвоена, то развязала бы руки и освободила многих от патриотического предрассудка…","“Excuse me, Dergachev, this is not the way to put it,” Tikhomirov again picked it up impatiently (Dergachev immediately yielded). - In view of the fact that Kraft made serious studies, drew conclusions on the basis of physiology, which he recognizes as mathematical, and killed, perhaps, two years on his idea (which I would calmly accept a priori), in view of this, that is, in view of the anxiety and seriousness Kraft, this case is presented as a phenomenon. From everything comes a question that Kraft cannot understand, and this is what we need to do, that is, not understanding Kraft, because this is a phenomenon. It must be decided whether this phenomenon belongs to the clinic, as an isolated case, or whether there is a property that can normally be repeated in others; this is interesting in terms of a general matter. About Russia, I will believe Kraft and even say that, perhaps, I am glad; if this idea were assimilated by everyone, it would untie the hands and free many from patriotic prejudice ...","""Wait, Dergachev, that's not the way to put it,"" Tikhomirov interrupted and Dergachev immediately yielded. ""Inasmuch as Kraft has done serious research and based his conclusions on physiological data, which he considers as certain as if mathematically demonstrated, and inasmuch as he has devoted two years of his life to this study (for my part, I'd have readily accepted his first conclusion a priori), in view also of Kraft's special interest in the problem and his well-known scrupulousness, I suggest that the fallacy of Kraft's final conclusion is, in its own right, a phenomenon worthy of study. We must first of all decide whether this is just a clinical aberration or an ordinary phenomenon affecting many people. Determining this point is very important for our cause. As to what he says about Russia, I not only readily believe him, but I welcome it heartily because, if it was generally accepted, it would untie many people's hands, emancipating them from the prejudice of patriotism.""","""Excuse me, Dergatchev, that's not the way to put it,"" Tihomirov interrupted impatiently again (Dergatchev at once gave way), ""considering that Kraft has made a serious study of the subject, has made on a physiological basis deductions which he regards as mathematically proved, and has spent perhaps two years on his idea (which I should be prepared a priori to accept with equanimity), considering all this, that is considering Kraft's excitement and earnestness, the case must be considered as a phenomenon. All this leads up to a question which Kraft cannot understand, and that's what we must attend to—I mean, Kraft's not understanding it, for that's the phenomenon. We must decide whether this phenomenon belongs to the domain of pathology as a solitary instance, or whether it is an occurrence which may be normally repeated in others; that's what is of interest for the common cause. I believe Kraft about Russia, and I will even say that I am glad of it, perhaps; if this idea were assimilated by all it would free many from patriotic prejudice and untie their hands … """

"В утро той страшной сцены рябой, тот самый, к которому перешли Тришатов и друг его, успел известить Бьоринга о предстоящем злоумышлении. Это случилось таким образом: Ламберт все-таки склонил его к участию вместе и, овладев тогда документом, сообщил ему все подробности и все обстоятельства предприятия, а наконец, и самый последний момент их плана, то есть когда Версилов выдумал комбинацию об обмане Татьяны Павловны. Но в решительное мгновение рябой предпочел изменить Ламберту, будучи благоразумнее их всех и предвидя в проектах их возможность уголовщины. Главное же: он почитал благодарность Бьоринга гораздо вернее фантастического плана неумелого, но горячего Ламберта и почти помешанного от страсти Версилова. Все это я узнал потом от Тришатова. Кстати, я не знаю и не понимаю отношений Ламберта к рябому и почему Ламберт не мог без него обойтись. Но гораздо любопытнее для меня вопрос: зачем нужен был Ламберту Версилов, тогда как Ламберт, имея уже в руках документ, совершенно бы мог обойтись без его помощи? Ответ мне теперь ясен: Версилов нужен был ему, во-первых, по знанию обстоятельств, а главное, Версилов был нужен ему, в случае переполоха или какой беды, чтобы свалить на него всю ответственность. А так как денег Версилову было не надо, то Ламберт и почел его помощь даже весьма не лишнею. Но Бьоринг не поспел тогда вовремя. Он прибыл уже через час после выстрела, когда квартира Татьяны Павловны представляла уже совсем другой вид. А именно: минут пять спустя после того как Версилов упал на ковер окровавленный, приподнялся и встал Ламберт, которого мы все считали убитым. Он с удивлением осмотрелся, вдруг быстро сообразил и вышел в кухню, не говоря ни слова, там надел свою шубу и исчез навсегда. «Документ» он оставил на столе. Я слышал, что он даже не был и болен, а лишь немного похворал; удар револьвером ошеломил его и вызвал кровь, не произведя более никакой беды. Меж тем Тришатов уже убежал за доктором; но еще до доктора очнулся и Версилов, а еще до Версилова Татьяна Павловна, приведя в чувство Катерину Николаевну, успела отвезти ее к ней домой. Таким образом, когда вбежал к нам Бьоринг, то в квартире Татьяны Павловны находились лишь я, доктор, больной Версилов и мама, еще больная, но прибывшая к нему вне себя и за которой сбегал тот же Тришатов. Бьоринг посмотрел с недоумением и, как только узнал, что Катерина Николаевна уже уехала, тотчас отправился к ней, не сказав у нас ни слова.","On the morning of that terrible scene, the pockmarked man, the same one to whom Trishatov and his friend had gone, managed to notify Boring of the impending malice. It happened in this way: Lambert nevertheless persuaded him to participate together and, having then taken possession of the document, told him all the details and all the circumstances of the enterprise, and finally, the very last moment of their plan, that is, when Versilov invented a combination about deceiving Tatyana Pavlovna. But at the decisive moment, the pockmarked one preferred to betray Lambert, being more prudent than all of them and foreseeing in their projects the possibility of criminality. Most importantly, he esteemed Bjoring's gratitude much more truly than the fantastic plan of the inept but ardent Lambert and Versilov, who was almost mad with passion. I learned all this later from Trishatov. By the way, I don't know and don't understand Lambert's relationship to the pockmarked man and why Lambert couldn't do without him. But the question is much more curious for me: why did Lambert need Versilov, while Lambert, having the document already in his hands, could have completely dispensed with his help? The answer is clear to me now: first, he needed Versilov, knowing the circumstances, and, most importantly, he needed Versilov, in the event of a commotion or some kind of misfortune, in order to dump all the responsibility on him. And since Versilov did not need money, Lambert even considered his help not very superfluous. But Björing did not ripen then in time. He arrived an hour after the shot, when Tatyana Pavlovna's apartment presented a completely different look. Namely: about five minutes after Versilov fell on the bloody carpet, Lambert, whom we all considered dead, got up and stood up. He looked around in surprise, suddenly quickly realized and went into the kitchen, without saying a word, there he put on his fur coat and disappeared forever. He left the ""document"" on the table. I heard that he was not even sick, but only a little sick; the blow from the revolver stunned him and drew blood, without causing any more trouble. Meanwhile, Trishatov had already run off to fetch the doctor; but even before the doctor Versilov came to, and even before Versilov Tatyana Pavlovna, having brought Katerina Nikolaevna to her senses, managed to take her to her house. Thus, when Boring ran in to us, it was only me, the doctor, the sick Versilov and my mother, who was still sick, but who came to him beside herself and whom the same Trishatov ran after, were in Tatyana Pavlovna's apartment. Björing looked in bewilderment, and as soon as he learned that Katerina Nikolaevna had already left, he immediately went to her place without saying a word to us.","The morning of the awful scene, pockmarked Semyon, the man to whom Trishatov and his long-legged friend had gone after deserting Lambert, had warned Bjoring about Lambert's plans. He had done so for practical considerations. Lambert had at first convinced him to come in on the deal with him and, after he had got hold of the document, he'd told him about every circumstance and every detail of the operation, including the final stratagem introduced by Versilov to get Mrs. Prutkov out of the way. At the last moment, however, Semyon, being the most practical man of the lot, had decided to pull out of it. He was afraid that it might lead to unpredictably grave consequences, what with the hotheaded and inexperienced Lambert and Versilov maddened by passion. Indeed, he felt it would be much wiser for him to rely on Bjoring's gratitude. All that I learned later from Trishatov, although I still don't quite understand why Lambert had to drag Semyon into the deal in the first place, nor can I make any sense out of the relations between the two of them. The question that preoccupied me much more was why Lambert had gone to Versilov. But now that is quite clear to me. First of all, Versilov knew all there was to know about the persons involved and, secondly, in case of trouble, if anything went wrong, Lambert hoped to be able to shift the blame to him. As it turned out, Bjoring didn't get there in time. He arrived a whole; hour after the shot had been fired, and by then Mrs. Prutkov's place; looked quite different. About five minutes after the bleeding Versilov had fallen to the carpet, Lambert, who had been lying in a puddle of his own blood and whom we'd all assumed dead, suddenly stirred, sat up, and scrambled to his feet. He stared around blankly for a while; then, apparently gathering what had happened, he walked out into the kitchen, put on his coat, and vanished. He did not look at the document that was lying there on the table. I vaguely heard that he hadn't been too badly hurt by the blow on the head: he got away with only a slight concussion and some loss of blood. Trishatov had rushed for a doctor, but Versilov came to before the doctor arrived. And even before that, Mrs. Prutkov had succeeded in bringing Katerina back to consciousness and had driven her home. Thus, by the time Bjoring arrived, he found only the wounded Versilov, the doctor, me, and my mother (Trishatov had told her and she'd rushed over although she was still ill). Bjoring looked around in bewilderment and, when told that Mrs. Akhmakov had been taken home, left without saying a word.","On the morning of that terrible scene, the pock-marked man to whom Trishatov and his tall friend had gone over, succeeded in letting Büring know of the proposed crime. This was how it happened. Lambert still tried to persuade him to work with him, and, when he gained possession of the letter, he told him all the details of the undertaking, up to the very last moment, that is, when Versilov suggested the trick to get rid of Tatyana Pavlovna. But at the last moment the pock-marked man, who had more sense than the rest, and foresaw the possibility of a serious crime being committed, preferred to betray Lambert. He reckoned upon Büring's gratitude as something more secure than the fantastic plan made by Lambert, who was clumsy and hotheaded, and by Versilov, who was almost mad with passion. All this I learned afterwards from Trishatov. I know nothing, by the way, of Lambert's relations with the pock- marked man, and I cannot understand why Lambert could not have acted without him. A question of far more interest for me is why Lambert needed Versilov when, having the letter in his possession, he might perfectly well have dispensed with the latter's assistance. The answer is clear to me now. Versilov was of use to Lambert from his knowledge of all the circumstances; moreover, if their plans miscarried, or some accident happened, Lambert reckoned on throwing all responsibility on Versilov. And since the latter did not want money, Lambert thought his help very opportune. But Büring did not arrive in time. When he reached the scene of action an hour later, Tatyana Pavlovna's flat wore a very different aspect. Five minutes after Versilov had fallen on the carpet, covered with blood, Lambert, whom we all believed to be dead, raised his head and got up. He looked about him with amazement, quickly grasped the position, went into the kitchen without saying a word, put on his coat, and disappeared for ever. The document he left on the table. I have heard that he was not seriously ill but only slightly indisposed afterwards; the blow from the revolver had stunned him and drawn blood, but had done no further harm. Meanwhile Trishatov had run for the doctor; but before the doctor arrived, Versilov, too, returned to consciousness, though before that Tatyana Pavlovna succeeded in bringing Katerina Nikolaevna to herself and taking her home. And so when Büring ran in upon us he found in Tatyana Pavlovna's flat only me, the doctor, Versilov, and my mother, who had been fetched by Trishatov, and though still ill, had come in haste, beside herself with anxiety. Büring stared at us with amazement, and as soon as he learned that Katerina Nikolaevna had gone home he went off to see her without saying another word to us."

"Я думал, что вслед за моим ответом он прибавит:",I thought that after my answer he would add:,"I expected him to follow up my answer with ""But for what?""",I thought that on my answering he would add:
"Без сомнения, я тотчас же понял, с кем имею дело. Во-первых, мне стало ясно, как дважды два, что из старика, даже почти еще бодрого и все-таки хоть сколько-нибудь разумного и хоть с каким-нибудь да характером, они, за это время, пока мы с ним не виделись, сделали какую-то мумию, какого-то совершенного ребенка, пугливого и недоверчивого. Прибавлю: он совершенно знал, зачем его сюда привезли, и все случилось точно так, как я объяснил выше, забегая вперед. Его прямо вдруг поразили, разбили, раздавили известием о предательстве его дочери и о сумасшедшем доме. Он дал себя увезти, едва сознавая от страха, что делает. Ему сказали, что я – обладатель тайны и что у меня ключ к окончательному решению. Скажу вперед: вот этого-то окончательного решения и ключа он и пугался пуще всего на свете. Он ждал, что я так и войду к нему с каким-то приговором на лбу и с бумагой в руках, и страшно был рад, что я покамест готов смеяться и болтать совсем о другом. Когда мы обнялись, он заплакал. Признаюсь, капельку заплакал и я; но мне вдруг стало его очень жалко… Маленькая Альфонсинкина собачонка заливалась тоненьким, как колокольчик, лаем и рвалась на меня с дивана. С этой крошечной собачкой он уже не расставался с тех пор, как приобрел ее, даже спал вместе с нею.","No doubt I immediately knew who I was dealing with. In the first place, it became clear to me, as two times two, that from an old man, even almost still vigorous and yet at least somewhat reasonable and at least with some kind of character, they, during this time, while we did not see each other , made some kind of mummy, some kind of perfect child, shy and distrustful. I will add: he knew perfectly well why he was brought here, and everything happened exactly as I explained above, looking ahead. He was suddenly struck, smashed, crushed by the news of his daughter's betrayal and the lunatic asylum. He let himself be taken away, scarcely aware of what he was doing. He was told that I was the owner of the secret and that I had the key to the final solution. I will tell you in advance: it was this final decision and key that he feared more than anything in the world. He was waiting for me to come in to him with some kind of sentence on my forehead and with a paper in my hands, and was terribly glad that for the time being I was ready to laugh and chat about something completely different. When we hugged, he cried. I confess, I cried a little too; but I suddenly felt very sorry for him ... Alfonsin's little dog burst into a bark, thin as a bell, and rushed at me from the sofa. He has not parted with this tiny dog since he acquired it, he even slept with her.","I saw at once how much he had changed. It was obvious that the vigorous old man with at least some common sense and character that I'd known had, since the last time I'd seen him, turned into some sort of a mummy with the mentality of a frightened and distrustful child. Let me add that he knew perfectly well why they'd brought him here, for everything had been done exactly as I've already explained. They had given him a real shock by suddenly revealing to him his daughter's betrayal and her intention of having him certified insane. So he'd allowed them to whisk him off, in his terror hardly realizing what he was doing. They'd told him that it was I who had the irrefutable proof of the plot against him. As it turned out, it was the final proof of the plot and the need for him to make an irrevocable decision that had frightened him most. So he'd expected me to march in sternly with doom in my eye and the terrible document in my hand. That's why he was so relieved and pleased that, for the time being at least, I seemed willing to laugh and talk to him about other things. As soon as we were in each other's arms, he began to weep. I admit that I too wept a little, but that was because I suddenly felt so awfully sorry for him. . . . Alphonsine's tiny lap dog started yapping at me furiously, an extraordinarily shrill yapping that sounded a bit like jingling bells. It looked as though it were going to pounce on me from the sofa. The old prince had never parted from it since he'd bought it from Alphon-sine. He even slept with it.","I realised unmistakably at once the condition of the man I had to deal with. To begin with, it was as clear as twice two make four that in the interval since I had seen him last they had turned the old man, till lately almost hale, and to some extent rational, and not altogether without will-power, into a sort of mummy, a scared and mistrustful child. I may add, he quite knew why they had brought him here, and everything had been done as I have explained already. He was suddenly shocked, crushed, and overwhelmed by being told of his daughter's treachery and of a possible madhouse. He had allowed himself to be carried off, so scared that he hardly knew what he was doing; he was told that I was in possession of the secret and that I had the proof that would establish the fact conclusively. I may mention at once: it was just that proof that would establish the fact which he dreaded more than anything in the world. He was expecting me to go in to him with a sort of death sentence in my face and a document in my hand, and was immensely delighted that I was ready meanwhile to laugh and chatter of other things. While we were embracing he shed tears. I must confess I shed a tear also; I felt suddenly very sorry for him. Alphonsine's little lap-dog broke into a bark as shrill as a bell, and made dashes at me from the sofa. He had not parted from this tiny dog since he had had it and even slept with it."

"Но не то смешно, когда я мечтал прежде «под одеялом», а то, что и приехал сюда для него же, опять-таки для этого выдуманного человека, почти забыв мои главные цели. Я ехал помочь ему сокрушить клевету, раздавить врагов. Тот документ, о котором говорил Крафт, то письмо этой женщины к Андроникову, которого так боится она, которое может сокрушить ее участь и ввергнуть ее в нищету и которое она предполагает у Версилова, – это письмо было не у Версилова, а у меня, зашито в моем боковом кармане! Я сам и зашивал, и никто во всем мире еще не знал об этом. То, что романическая Марья Ивановна, у которой документ находился «на сохранении», нашла нужным передать его мне, и никому иному, то были лишь ее взгляд и ее воля, и объяснять это я не обязан; может быть, когда-нибудь к слову и расскажу; но столь неожиданно вооруженный, я не мог не соблазниться желанием явиться в Петербург. Конечно, я полагал помочь этому человеку не иначе как втайне, не выставляясь и не горячась, не ожидая ни похвал, ни объятий его. И никогда, никогда бы я не удостоил попрекнуть его чем-нибудь! Да и вина ли его в том, что я влюбился в него и создал из него фантастический идеал? Да я даже, может быть, вовсе и не любил его! Его оригинальный ум, его любопытный характер, какие-то там его интриги и приключения и то, что была при нем моя мать, – все это, казалось, уже не могло бы остановить меня; довольно было и того, что моя фантастическая кукла разбита и что я, может быть, уже не могу любить его больше. Итак, что же останавливало меня, на чем я завяз? – вот вопрос. В итоге выходило, что глуп только я, а более никто.","But it’s not so funny when I used to dream “under the covers”, but that I came here for him, again for this fictional person, almost forgetting my main goals. I went to help him crush his slander, crush his enemies. That document that Kraft spoke of, that letter from this woman to Andronikov, which she is so afraid of, which can crush her fate and plunge her into poverty and which she assumes from Versilov, this letter was not from Versilov, but from me, sewn up in my side pocket! I sewed it myself, and no one in the whole world knew about it yet. The fact that the romantic Marya Ivanovna, in whose possession the document was ""for safekeeping,"" found it necessary to hand it over to me, and to no one else, was only her opinion and her will, and I am not obliged to explain this; maybe someday I’ll tell you by the way; but so unexpectedly armed, I could not help but be tempted by the desire to appear in Petersburg. Of course, I thought to help this man only in secret, without showing off and without getting excited, without expecting either praise or his embraces. And never, never would I deign to reproach him with anything! And is it his fault that I fell in love with him and created a fantastic ideal out of him? Yes, I even, perhaps, did not love him at all! His original mind, his curious character, some of his intrigues and adventures, and the fact that my mother was with him - all this, it seemed, could no longer stop me; it was enough that my fantastic doll was broken, and that perhaps I could no longer love him any more. So, what stopped me, what did I get stuck on? - that's the question. In the end, it turned out that only I was stupid, and no one else.","But what struck me as funny now was not the fancies I used to invent about Versilov under my blanket as a child, but that I went to Kraft's today because of him, a mere figment of my own imagination. I was so obsessed with him that I almost forgot my main goal. I had come to help him stamp out the calumny about him and confound his enemies. The document Kraft had mentioned, the letter written by that woman to Andronikov, in which she now saw such a terrifying threat to herself and which she assumed was in Versilov's possession, actually was not in his hands since it was sewn into the lining of my side pocket! I had sewn it there myself and no one in the world except Maria knew about it. The fact that Maria, who was, I suppose, in her way a sort of romantic and who had been entrusted with the document, had decided to give the letter to me was, on her part, a decision based on reasons that I don't feel it necessary to explain here, although I may later if I see a point to it. But whatever the reasons, once I had that document in my possession, I felt in such a strong position that I was only too tempted to rush off to Petersburg. Obviously, I planned to help that man without his even knowing it, without showing myself, without expecting him to throw himself into my arms and thank me and all that sort of nonsense. And I would certainly never have paid him the tribute of reproaching him for anythingl Anyway, how could he be responsible for my falling in love with him and building him into some sort of an ideal? Besides, perhaps I didn't really love him at all. Neither his originality nor his fascinating character, neither his complicated scheming nor his strange adventures, not even the presence of my mother at his side could stop me any longer now. It was enough to realize that my fairy tale puppet had been shattered and that perhaps I could no longer love him. So what was there to stop me, to hold me back? That was the question. When everything was taken into consideration, the upshot was that the only fool around was me and no one else.","But what is absurd is not that I used to dream of him in my little bed but that, almost forgetting my chief object, I have come here for the sake of him, of that ""imagined"" man. I have come to help him to stamp out a calumny, to crush his enemies. The document of which Kraft had spoken, that woman's letter to Andronikov about which she was so afraid, which might ruin her and reduce her to poverty, which she supposed to be in Versilov's hands, was not in his possession but in mine, sewn up in my coat pocket! I had sewn it there myself, and no one in the whole world knew of it. The fact that the romantic Marie Ivanovna, in whose keeping the letter was left ""to be preserved,"" thought fit to give it to me and to no one else was only her own idea and a matter for her to decide, which I am not called upon to explain, though I may discuss it later if it seems appropriate. But, armed with this unexpected weapon, I could not help yielding to the temptation to come to Petersburg. Of course, I proposed to assist this man secretly without display or excitement, without expecting his praise or his embraces. And never, never would I condescend to reproach him for anything. And indeed, was it his fault that I had fallen in love with him and had created a fantastic ideal of him? Though, indeed, I did not perhaps love him at all! His original mind, his interesting character, his intrigues and adventures, and what my mother had been to him—all that, it seemed could not keep me. It was enough that my fantastic doll was shattered, and that I could not, perhaps, love him any more. And so what was keeping me? why was I sticking there?—that was the question. The upshot of it all was that only I was a fool, no one else."

""She's just an ordinary woman, and perhaps even a rotten one at that. . . . But it's her duty to be perfect in every sense.""","""Perfection? Her perfection?

"Я полетел на рулетку, как будто в ней сосредоточилось все мое спасение, весь выход, а между тем, как сказал уже, до приезда князя я об ней и не думал. Да и играть ехал я не для себя, а на деньги князя для князя же; осмыслить не могу, что влекло меня, но влекло непреоборимо. О, никогда эти люди, эти лица, эти круперы, эти игорные крики, вся эта подлая зала у Зерщикова, никогда не казалось мне все это так омерзительно, так мрачно, так грубо и грустно, как в этот раз! Я слишком помню скорбь и грусть, по временам хватавшую меня за сердце во все эти часы у стола. Но для чего я не уезжал? Для чего выносил, точно принял на себя жребий, жертву, подвиг? Скажу лишь одно: вряд ли я могу сказать про себя тогдашнего, что был в здравом рассудке. А между тем никогда еще не играл я так разумно, как в этот вечер. Я был молчалив и сосредоточен, внимателен и расчетлив ужасно; я был терпелив и скуп и в то же время решителен в решительные минуты. Я поместился опять у zero, то есть опять между Зерщиковым и Афердовым, который всегда усаживался подле Зерщикова справа; мне претило это место, но мне непременно хотелось ставить на zero, а все остальные места у zéro были заняты. Мы играли уже с лишком час; наконец я увидел с своего места, что князь вдруг встал и, бледный, перешел к нам и остановился передо мной напротив, через стол: он все проиграл и молча смотрел на мою игру, впрочем, вероятно, ничего в ней не понимая и даже не думая уже об игре. К этому времени я только что стал выигрывать, и Зерщиков отсчитал мне деньги. Вдруг Афердов, молча, в моих глазах, самым наглым образом, взял и присоединил к своей, лежавшей перед ним куче денег, одну из моих сторублевых. Я вскрикнул и схватил его за руку. Тут со мной произошло нечто мною неожиданное: я точно сорвался с цепи; точно все ужасы и обиды этого дня вдруг сосредоточились в этом одном мгновении, в этом исчезновении сторублевой. Точно все накопившееся и сдавленное во мне ждало только этого мига, чтобы прорваться.","I flew to the roulette wheel, as if all my salvation, my whole way out was concentrated in it, and meanwhile, as I have already said, before the arrival of the prince I did not even think about it. Yes, and I went to play not for myself, but with the prince's money for the prince; I can’t comprehend what attracted me, but it irresistibly attracted me. Oh, never have these people, these faces, these croupiers, these gambling cries, all this vile hall at Zershchikov's, never did all this seem to me so disgusting, so gloomy, so rude and sad, as this time! I remember too well the grief and sadness that at times grabbed my heart during all those hours at the table. But why didn't I leave? Why endured, as if he took upon himself a lot, a sacrifice, a feat? I will only say one thing: I can hardly say about myself then that I was in my right mind. And yet I have never played so intelligently as I did that evening. I was silent and concentrated, attentive and prudent terribly; I was patient and stingy, and at the same time resolute at decisive moments. I again placed myself at zero, that is, again between Zershchikov and Aferdov, who always sat down beside Zershchikov on the right; I hated this place, but I certainly wanted to bet on zero, and all the other places at zéro were taken. We've been playing for over an hour now; Finally, I saw from my seat that the prince suddenly got up and, pale, went over to us and stopped in front of me across the table: he lost everything and silently looked at my game, however, probably not understanding anything in it and not even thinking already about the game. By this time I had just begun to win, and Zerschikov counted out the money for me. Suddenly Aferdov, silently, in my eyes, in the most impudent way, took and attached to his heap of money lying in front of him, one of my hundred rubles. I screamed and grabbed his hand. Then something unexpected happened to me: I seemed to have broken the chain; it was as if all the horrors and insults of that day were suddenly concentrated in this one moment, in this disappearance of the hundred-ruble girl. It was as if everything accumulated and squeezed in me was only waiting for this moment to break through.","I pounced on the roulette table as though my whole salvation lay hidden in it, although, as I said before, I'd never given it a thought until Sergei's arrival. Besides, I wasn't even going to play for my own account; I was going to gamble with Sergei's money, risk his life. I still can't understand what it was that drew me there, but it was an irresistible pull. And never did the people, the faces, the croupiers, the excited shouting of the gamblers, the whole gaudy gaming room at Zershikov's strike me as so revolting, grim, vulgar, and depressing as it did then. I remember only too well the sad and painful feeling that kept tugging at my heart during those hours at the table. But why didn't I leave then? Why did I stay and bear it all as if I'd accepted to bear a cross, as if I were ready to perform a feat of heroism? All I can say of myself at the time is that I was insane. And yet never before had I played my stakes as calmly and deliberately as I did that evening. I was silent, concentrated, attentive, and frightfully calculating; I was patient and stingy, although also resolute at critical moments. Once again I installed myself in the vicinity of the zero, which happened to be between Zershikov and Aferdov, who always sat on Zershikov's right; that place was distasteful to me, but I had to sit there because I had to be near the zero and all the other chairs nearby were taken. I had been playing for an hour or more already when suddenly I saw Sergei get up from his seat. He took a few steps and stopped just across the table from me. He had lost everything and was now watching me play, although I don't believe he could understand what was going on; indeed, from what I was to learn later, he probably wasn't thinking about gambling at all. At that moment I had just started winning and Zershikov was counting out the money that was coming to me when, all of a sudden, Aferdov quite unabashedly picked up one of my hundred-ruble bills and, before my eyes, added it to the pile of money in front of him. I let out a cry and grabbed his hand. Something quite unexpected happened inside me: it was as if all at once I'd broken loose from the chain I'd been tied to; it was as if all the blows and insults I'd been exposed to lately became concentrated at that second in that hundred-ruble bill, of which I was being robbed; it was as if everything that had been accumulated and compressed inside me had been waiting for just that additional provocation to burst out.","I flew to the roulette table as though in it were concentrated all hopes of my salvation, all means of escape, and yet as I have mentioned already , I had not once thought of it before Prince Sergay's arrival. Moreover, I was going to gamble, not for myself but for Prince Sergay, and with his money; I can't explain what was the attraction, but it was an irresistible attraction. Oh, never had those people, those faces, those croupiers with their monotonous shouts, all the details of the squalid gambling saloon seemed so revolting to me, so depressing, so coarse, and so melancholy as that evening! I remember well the sadness and misery that gripped my heart at times during those hours at the gambling table. But why didn't I go away? Why did I endure and, as it were, accept this fate, this sacrifice, this devotion? I will only say one thing: I can hardly say of myself that I was then in my right senses. Yet at the same time, I had never played so prudently as that evening. I was silent and concentrated, attentive and extremely calculating; I was patient and niggardly, and at the same time resolute at critical moments. I established myself again at the zero end of the table, that is between Zerstchikov and Aferdov, who always sat on the former's right hand; the place was distasteful to me, but I had an overwhelming desire to stake on zero, and all the other places at that end were taken. We had been playing over an hour; at last, from my place, I saw Prince Sergay get up from his seat and with a pale face move across to us and remain facing me the other side of the table: he had lost all he had and watched my play in silence, though he probably did not follow it and had ceased to think of play. At that moment I just began winning, and Zerstchikov was counting me out what I had won. Suddenly, without a word, Aferdov with the utmost effrontery took one of my hundred-rouble notes before my very eyes and added it to the pile of money lying before him. I cried out, and caught hold of his hand. Then something quite unexpected happened to me: it was as though I had broken some chain that restrained me, as though all the affronts and insults of that day were concentrated in that moment in the loss of that hundred-rouble note. It was as though everything that had been accumulating and suppressed within me had only been waiting for that moment to break out."

"Потом, когда уж я в последней степени озлился, то на вопрос: вы князь? твердо раз ответил:","Then, when I was already angry to the last degree, then to the question: are you a prince? answered firmly:","And later, when I really couldn't stand it any longer, I'd tell them:","Later on, when I began to get very cross about it, I always answered the question ""Are you a prince?"" by saying, ""No, I'm the son of a servant, formerly a serf."" At last, when I was roused to the utmost pitch of fury, I resolutely answered:"
"– Да ведь что ж, Андрей Петрович, придумать-то? Никак не придумаешь нового-то кушанья никакого, – робко ответила мама.","- Why, Andrey Petrovich, come up with something?

"– Да я и не обвиняю, совсем нет, и, поверьте, не жалуюсь на Тушара! – прокричал я, несколько сбитый с толку, – да и бил он меня каких-нибудь месяца два. Я, помню, все хотел его чем-то обезоружить, бросался целовать его руки и целовал их и все плакал-плакал. Товарищи смеялись надо мною и презирали меня, потому что Тушар стал употреблять меня иногда как прислугу, приказывал подавать себе платье, когда одевался. Тут мое лакейство пригодилось мне инстинктивно: я старался изо всех сил угодить и нисколько не оскорблялся, потому что ничего еще я этого не понимал, и удивляюсь даже до сей поры тому, что был так еще тогда глуп, что не мог понять, как я всем им неровня. Правда, товарищи много мне и тогда уже объяснили, школа была хорошая. Тушар кончил тем, что полюбил более пинать меня коленком сзади, чем бить по лицу; а через полгода так даже стал меня иногда и ласкать; только нет-нет, а в месяц раз, наверно, побьет, для напоминания, чтоб не забывался. С детьми тоже скоро меня посадили вместе и пускали играть, но ни разу, в целые два с половиной года, Тушар не забыл различия в социальном положении нашем, и хоть не очень, а все же употреблял меня для услуг постоянно, я именно думаю, чтоб мне напомнить.","- Yes, I do not blame, not at all, and, believe me, I do not complain about Touchard! - I shouted, somewhat bewildered, - and he beat me for about two months. I remember that I kept wanting to disarm him with something, rushed to kiss his hands and kissed them, and kept crying and crying. The comrades laughed at me and despised me, because Touchard began to use me sometimes as a servant, ordered me to give him a dress when he dressed. Here my servility came in handy instinctively: I tried my best to please and was not offended in the least, because I still did not understand anything of this, and I am surprised even to this day that I was so stupid even then that I could not understand how I they are uncomfortable. True, my comrades explained a lot to me even then, the school was good. Touchard ended up loving more to kick me from behind with his knee than to beat me in the face; and six months later he even began to caress me sometimes; only no, no, but once a month, probably, he will beat him, for a reminder, so that he does not forget. With the children, too, they soon put me together and let me play, but not once, in the whole two and a half years, Touchard did not forget the difference in our social position, and, although not very much, he nevertheless used me for services constantly, I just think that remind me.","""You've got me all wrong!"" I shouted, staring at him in bewilderment, ""I'm not reproaching you for anything, nor am I complaining about Touchard! As a matter of fact, he only beat me for a couple of months or so. I remember trying to appease him somehow. I'd try and kiss his hands, did kiss them in fact, and I cried and cried. The other boys laughed at me and despised me because Touchard started to use me as a servant, ordered me to hand him his clothes when he dressed. My instinctive servility was useful in this case: I tried hard to please him and felt not in the least insulted because I didn't understand yet about these things. It still amazes me how stupid I was then not to understand that I was not the equal of all these people. It's true that the other boys contributed quite a bit to my eventual understanding —it was a good school in that respect. Eventually Touchard stopped slapping me and, instead, kicked me from behind with his knee. And six months later, he was occasionally even quite nice to me, hitting me perhaps no more than once a month just to remind me of my place. And eventually he allowed me to sit at the table with the other boys and play with them. But not for one second in the two and a half years I spent at his school did Touchard forget my socially inferior status, and he continued using me occasionally for menial tasks, per-haps to make sure that proper order was respected.","""But I am not blaming you at all, and believe me, I am not complaining of Touchard,"" I cried, a little disconcerted. "" Though, indeed, he beat me for ten months or so. I remember I was always trying to appease him in some way; I used to rush to kiss his hands, I was always kissing them, and I was always crying and crying. My schoolfellows laughed at me and despised me, because Touchard began to treat me sometimes like a servant, he used to order me to bring him his clothes when he was dressing. My menial instincts were of use to me there; I did my very utmost to please him, and was not in the least offended, because I did not at that time understand it at all, and I am surprised to this day that I could have been so stupid as not to realize that I was not on an equal footing with the rest. It's true my schoolfellows made many things clear to me even then; it was a good school. Touchard came in the end to prefer giving me a kick to slapping me in the face, and six months later he even began to be affectionate; only he never failed to beat me once a month or so to remind me not to forget myself. He soon let me sit with the other boys, too, and allowed me to play with them, but not once during those two and a half years did Touchard forget the difference in our social positions, and from time to time, though not very frequently, he employed me in menial tasks, I verily believe, to remind me of it."

"Примерно четверть часа спустя раздался в коридоре, у самой двери Васина, громкий и развязный мужской голос. Кто-то схватился за ручку двери и приотворил ее настолько, что можно было разглядеть в коридоре какого-то высокого ростом мужчину, очевидно тоже и меня увидавшего и даже меня уже рассматривавшего, но не входившего еще в комнату, а продолжавшего, через весь коридор и держась за ручку, разговаривать с хозяйкой. Хозяйка перекликалась с ним тоненьким и веселеньким голоском, и уж по голосу слышалось, что посетитель ей давно знаком, уважаем ею и ценим, и как солидный гость и как веселый господин. Веселый господин кричал и острил, но дело шло только о том, что Васина нет дома, что он все никак не может застать его, что это ему на роду написано и что он опять, как тогда, подождет, и все это, без сомнения, казалось верхом остроумия хозяйке. Наконец гость вошел, размахнув дверь на весь отлет.","About a quarter of an hour later, a loud and cheeky male voice was heard in the corridor, at Vassin's very door. Someone grabbed the handle of the door and opened it so much that one could see in the corridor a tall man, who obviously also saw me and even looked at me, but did not yet enter the room, but continued, through the entire corridor and holding the handle, talking with the hostess. The hostess called to him in a thin and cheerful voice, and it was already clear from his voice that the visitor had long been known to her, respected and appreciated by her, both as a respectable guest and as a cheerful gentleman. The merry gentleman shouted and joked, but the only thing was that Vassin was not at home, that he still could not find him, that it was written for him in his family and that he would wait again, as then, and all this, no doubt, seemed the height of wit to the hostess. Finally, the guest entered, swinging the door all the way.","Perhaps another quarter of an hour passed. Then I heard the loud and unrestrained voice of a man just outside Vasin's door.

The landlady spoke in a high-pitched, playful voice by which one could tell that she knew the visitor well, appreciated him as a respectable gentleman and good company. The stranger joked in a loud voice about his bad luck at never finding Vasin at home, that maybe it was his fate always to miss him but that, nevertheless, he'd try and wait for Vasin again. All that seemed exquisitely witty to the landlady, so great was her appreciation. Finally, the gentleman flung the door open wide and stepped into the room.","About a quarter of an hour later I heard in the corridor at Vassin's door a loud and free-and-easy masculine voice.

The landlady called back to him in a thin, piping little voice which betrayed that he was an old acquaintance, respected and valued by her as a visitor of consequence, and a gentleman of a merry disposition. The merry gentleman shouted witticisms, but his theme was only the impossibility of finding Vassin at home. He declared that this was his destiny from his birth up, that he would wait again as before. And all this, no doubt, seemed the height of wit to the landlady.

"Тут я подробно не стану и не могу описывать. Сцена вышла ужасная и низкая, а я вдруг как бы потерял рассудок. Кажется, я подскочил и ударил его, по крайней мере сильно толкнул. Он тоже ударил меня из всей силы по голове, так что я упал на пол. Опомнившись, я пустился уже за ними на лестницу; помню, что у меня из носу текла кровь. У подъезда их ждала карета, и, пока князя сажали, я подбежал к карете и, несмотря на отталкивавшего меня лакея, опять бросился на Бьоринга. Тут не помню, как очутилась полиция. Бьоринг схватил меня за шиворот и грозно велел городовому отвести меня в участок. Я кричал, что и он должен идти вместе, чтоб вместе составить акт, и что меня не смеют взять, почти что с моей квартиры. Но так как дело было на улице, а не в квартире, и так как я кричал, бранился и дрался, как пьяный, и так как Бьоринг был в своем мундире, то городовой и взял меня. Но тут уж я пришел в полное исступление и, сопротивляясь из всех сил, кажется, ударил и городового. Затем, помню, их вдруг явилось двое, и меня повели. Едва помню, как привели меня в какую-то дымную, закуренную комнату, со множеством разных людей, стоявших и сидевших, ждавших и писавших; я продолжал и здесь кричать, я требовал акта. Но дело уже состояло не в одном акте, а усложнилось буйством и бунтом против полицейской власти. Да и был я в слишком безобразном виде. Кто-то вдруг грозно закричал на меня. Городовой меж тем обвинял меня в драке, рассказал о полковнике…","Here I will not and cannot describe in detail. The scene came out terrible and low, and I suddenly seemed to lose my mind. I think I jumped up and hit him, at least pushed him hard. He also hit me on the head with all his might, so that I fell to the floor. Coming to my senses, I followed them up the stairs; I remember bleeding from my nose. A carriage was waiting for them at the entrance, and while the prince was being seated, I ran up to the carriage and, in spite of the footman pushing me away, again rushed at Bjoring. I don't remember how the police got there. Björing grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and sternly ordered the policeman to take me to the police station. I shouted that he, too, must go together in order to draw up an act together, and that they did not dare to take me, almost from my apartment. But since it was on the street, and not in the apartment, and since I was shouting, scolding and fighting like a drunk, and since Björing was in his uniform, the policeman took me. But then I went into a complete frenzy and, resisting with all my might, it seems, hit the policeman too. Then, I remember, two of them suddenly appeared, and they led me away. I can hardly remember how they led me into some smoky, smoke-filled room, with many different people standing and sitting, waiting and writing; I continued to shout here too, I demanded an act. But the matter no longer consisted in one act, but was complicated by violence and rebellion against the police authorities. Yes, and I was too ugly. Someone suddenly shouted menacingly at me. Meanwhile, the policeman accused me of a fight, told me about the colonel ...","I cannot, nor do I wish to, describe in great detail what happened then. It was a horrible, vulgar scene. It seems to me I suddenly went berserk. I remember rushing at him and hitting or at least shoving him violently. Then he struck me awfully hard on the head and I went down. When I came to, I rushed after them downstairs. I noticed that I was bleeding from the nose. There was a carriage waiting for them outside. While they were getting the prince into the carriage, avoiding the footman who was trying to hold me back, I managed to get at Bjoring once more. The next thing I remember, there were police all around us and Bjoring, holding me by the collar, was ordering them to take me to the police station. I screamed that he had to come too, that each of us had to make a statement, and that they had no right just to drag me off to the station practically from my home. . . . But unfortunately all this was taking place not at my domicile but in the street, and since I was screaming, fighting like a drunk, and guilty of disorderly behavior, and since Bjoring was wearing a colonel's uniform, they decided to take just me to the police station. This aroused me to a paroxysm of rage: I resisted desperately and as far as I remember, I hit a policeman. Then, I believe, two of them led me off to the station. I have only vague recollections of finding myself in a smoke-filled room with lots of people sitting and standing all around, people waiting and writing things, and myself shouting and protesting that I demanded to be allowed to make my deposition. . . . But it was no longer just a matter of making a statement; my case had become aggravated by disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Besides, I was very ugly to look at. Suddenly someone hollered at me. The arresting police officer was accusing me of assaulting a colonel .","What happened then I cannot describe exactly, and will not attempt to. The scene that followed was horrible and degrading. I seemed suddenly to lose my reason. I believe I dashed up and struck him, or at least gave him a violent push. He struck me with all his might on my head so that I fell on the floor. When I came to, I rushed after them down stairs. I remember that my nose was bleeding. At the entrance a carriage was waiting for them, and while they were getting the prince in, I ran up, and in spite of the lackey, who pushed me back I rushed at Büring again. At this point the police turned up, I don't know how. Büring seized me by the collar and in a threatening voice ordered the police to take me into custody. I shouted that he ought to come with me, that we might make our affirmation together, and that they dare not take me almost from my own lodging. But as it had all happened in the street and not in the flat, and as I shouted and fought like a drunken man, and as Büring was wearing his uniform, the policeman took me. But flying into a perfect frenzy, I believe at that point I struck the policeman too. Then I remember two of them suddenly appeared and carried me off. I faintly remember they took me to a room full of tobacco smoke, with all sorts of people standing and sitting about in it waiting and writing; here too I went on shouting, and insisting on making a statement. But things had gone beyond that, and were complicated by violence and resisting the police, besides I looked absolutely disreputable. Some one shouted at me angrily. Meanwhile the policeman charging me with fighting was describing the colonel …"

"Я все еще не успел приобрести расположения этой особы; даже, напротив, она еще пуще стала на меня нападать за все про все. Особенно усилилось ее неудовольствие на меня за последнее время: она видеть не могла моего франтовского платья, а Лиза передавала мне, что с ней почти случился припадок, когда она узнала, что у меня лихач-извозчик. Я кончил тем, что по возможности стал избегать с ней встречи. Два месяца назад, после отдачи наследства, я было забежал к ней поболтать о поступке Версилова, но не встретил ни малейшего сочувствия; напротив, она была страшно обозлена: ей очень не понравилось, что отдано все, а не половина; мне же она резко тогда заметила:","I still have not managed to acquire the favor of this person; on the contrary, she began to attack me even more for everything about everything. Her displeasure with me has especially increased lately: she could not see my smart dress, and Liza told me that she almost had a seizure when she found out that I had a cab driver. I ended up avoiding her as much as possible. Two months ago, after the giving away of the inheritance, I ran to her to chat about Versilov's act, but did not meet with the slightest sympathy; on the contrary, she was terribly angry: she did not like very much that everything was given, and not half; She remarked sharply to me:","I had still been unable to get in her good graces. Indeed, she pounced on me these days more than ever, at the slightest provocation or even without one. She disapproved in particular of my highly fashionable clothes, and Lisa told me that when Mrs. Prutkov had learned that I had at my beck and call a coachman and horses, she had something like a fit. It had got to the point where I started avoiding her as much as I could. When, two months before, I'd dropped in on her to talk to her about Versilov's noble gesture, I'd found no sympathy whatsoever: she was very displeased that Versilov had given up the whole inheritance instead of just half of it. And she added tartly:","I had not yet succeeded in gaining the good graces of that lady, quite the contrary in fact; she used to fall foul of me more than ever, for everything, and about everything. Her displeasure had of late become more accentuated than ever; she could not endure the sight of my foppish clothes, and Liza told me that she almost had a fit when she heard that I kept a coachman and a smart turn-out. I ended by avoiding meeting her as far as possible. Two months before, when the disputed inheritance was given up to Prince Sergay, I had run to Tatyana Pavlovna, meaning to talk over Versilov's conduct with her, but I met with no trace of sympathy; on the contrary she was dreadfully angry: she was particularly vexed that the whole had been given back, instead of half the fortune; she observed sharply:"

"– То-то и есть, что уж слишком скоро! – подхватила Анна Андреевна с каким-то даже восторгом сочувствия. – О, если б вы знали, какая там теперь интрига! Конечно, Аркадий Макарович, вам трудно теперь понять всю щекотливость моего положения, – произнесла она, покраснев и потупившись. – С тех пор, в то самое утро, как мы с вами в последний раз виделись, я сделала тот шаг, который не всякий способен понять и разобрать так, как бы понял его человек с вашим незараженным еще умом, с вашим любящим, неиспорченным, свежим сердцем. Будьте уверены, друг мой, что я способна оценить вашу ко мне преданность и заплачу вам вечною благодарностью. В свете, конечно, подымут на меня камень и подняли уже. Но если б даже они были правы, с своей гнусной точки зрения, то кто бы мог, кто бы смел из них даже и тогда осудить меня? Я оставлена отцом моим с детства; мы, Версиловы, древний, высокий русский род, мы – проходимцы, я ем чужой хлеб из милости. Не естественно ли мне было обратиться к тому, кто еще с детства заменял мне отца, чьи милости я видела на себе столько лет? Мои чувства к нему видит и судит один только Бог, и я не допускаю светского суда над собою в сделанном мною шаге! Когда же тут, сверх того, самая коварная, самая мрачная интрига и доверчивого, великодушного отца сговорилась погубить его же собственная дочь, то разве это можно снести? Нет, пусть сгублю даже репутацию мою, но спасу его!

Rest assured, my friend, that I am able to appreciate your devotion to me and pay you eternal gratitude. In the light, of course, they will raise a stone at me and have already raised it. But even if they were right, from their vile point of view, then who could, who would have dared to condemn me even then? I have been abandoned by my father since childhood; we, the Versilovs, are an ancient, high Russian family, we are rogues, I eat someone else's bread out of mercy. Was it not natural for me to turn to the one who, from childhood, replaced my father, whose favors I had seen on myself for so many years? Only God sees and judges my feelings for him, and I do not allow secular judgment on myself in the step I have taken! When here, moreover, the most insidious, most gloomy intrigue and trusting, generous father conspired to destroy his own daughter, then how can this be endured? No, even if I ruin my reputation, I will save him! I am ready to live with him simply as a nanny, to be his watchman, nurse, but I will not let cold, secular, vile calculation triumph!",". . .

I realize, Arkady,"" she said, turning pink and bashfully lowering her eyes, ""how difficult it is for you to understand the delicacy of my present position.

I want you to know, my dear friend, that I am capable of appreciating your devotion to me and am eternally grateful to you for it. In society, of course, there are those who will cast stones at me, and some have already picked up their stones. But even supposing they may be right from their ignoble point of view, even so who of them would dare to condemn me? I was abandoned by my father when I was still a child. The Versilovs are an old Russian family, and yet I've been forced to live on charity as if I were scum! So wasn't it natural for me to turn to the man who had replaced my father since my childhood and whose kindness I had experienced for so many years? How I feel toward him is for God alone to judge and I refuse to accept the judgment of society, whether they approve or disapprove of the step I've taken. And when, on top of everything, I find out about a sinister and sordid intrigue hatched against a kind and trusting father by his own daughter, who is determined to ruin him, how can I stand idly by? And I don't care if it costs me my reputation or not, but I will save him! If need be, I'm prepared to be nothing but his nurse, to look after him, be at his bedside when he's ill, but I'm not going to allow their cold, sordid, worldly schemes to triumph!""","""I should think she was too hasty indeed!"" Anna Andrevevna assented quickly, with a sort of ecstasy of sympathy. "" Oh, if only you knew the intrigue that is being hatched there now! Of course, Arkady Makarovitch, of course it is difficult for you to realize now all the delicacy of my position,"" she brought out, blushing and casting down her eyes. "" Since I saw you last … that very morning I took a step which not every one would be able to understand and interpret rightly; so it is hardly likely that it would be understood by anyone with your still uncorrupted mind, and your fresh, loving, unsophisticated heart. Believe me, my dear friend, I appreciate your devotion to me, and I shall repay it with my everlasting gratitude. In the world, of course, they will throw stones at me, they have thrown them already. But even if they were right, from their odious point of view, which of them could, which of them dare judge me I have been abandoned by my father from childhood up; we Versilovs are an ancient noble Russian family, yet we are adventurers, and I am eating the bread of charity. Was it not natural I should turn to one who has taken the place of a father to me, at whose hands I have received nothing but kindness during all these years? My feelings for him are known only to God, and he alone can judge them, and I refuse to accept the judgment of the world upon the step I have taken. When there is, moreover, at the bottom of this the most cunning, the most evil intrigue, and the plot to ruin a trusting, noble-hearted father is the work of his own daughter, is it to be endured? No, I will save him if I have to ruin my reputation. I am ready to be with him simply as a nurse, to take care of him, and to look after him, but I will not let hateful, cold, mercenary worldliness triumph!"""

Мне почему-то стало досадно.,For some reason I got bored.,Somehow I felt irritated.,For some reason I felt annoyed.
"Когда внесли чай, я объяснил ему, что попрошу его гостеприимства всего только на одну ночь и что если нельзя, то пусть скажет, и я перееду на постоялый двор. Затем вкратце изложил мои причины, выставив прямо и просто, что поссорился с Версиловым окончательно, не вдаваясь при этом в подробности. Васин выслушал внимательно, но без всякого волнения. Вообще, он отвечал только на вопросы, хотя отвечал радушно и в достаточной полноте. Про письмо же, с которым я приходил к нему давеча просить совета, я совсем умолчал; а давешнее посещение мое объяснил как простой визит. Дав слово Версилову, что письмо это, кроме меня, никому не будет известно, я почел уже себя не вправе объявлять о нем кому бы то ни было. Мне особенно почему-то противно стало сообщать о иных делах Васину. О иных, но не о других; мне все-таки удалось заинтересовать его рассказами о давешних сценах в коридоре и у соседок, кончившихся в квартире Версилова. Он выслушал чрезвычайно внимательно, особенно о Стебелькове. О том, как Стебельков расспрашивал про Дергачева, он заставил повторить два раза и даже задумался; впрочем, все-таки под конец усмехнулся. Мне вдруг в это мгновение показалось, что Васина ничто и никогда не может поставить в затруднение; впрочем, первая мысль об этом, я помню, представилась мне в весьма лестной для него форме.","When tea was brought in, I explained to him that I would only ask for his hospitality for one night only, and that if it was not possible, let him tell me, and I would move to the inn. Then he briefly outlined my reasons, stating directly and simply that he had finally quarreled with Versilov, without going into details. Vassin listened attentively, but without any emotion. In general, he answered only questions, although he answered cordially and in sufficient detail. About the letter with which I came to him just now to ask for advice, I completely kept silent; and my recent visit was explained as a simple visit. Having given my word to Versilov that this letter would be known to no one but me, I considered myself no longer entitled to announce it to anyone. For some reason I was especially disgusted to report other cases to Vasin. About others, but not about others; I nevertheless managed to interest him with stories about the recent scenes in the corridor and with the neighbors, which ended in Versilov's apartment. He listened extremely attentively, especially about Stebelkov. About how Stebelkov asked about Dergachev, he made me repeat it twice and even thought about it; However, he did smile at the end. It suddenly seemed to me at that moment that nothing could ever put Vassin in difficulty; however, the first thought about this, I remember, presented itself to me in a form that was very flattering to him.","After tea had been brought in, I asked him whether he could put me up just for one night, but said if it was inconvenient I'd go to a hotel. I explained to him briefly that I'd broken off with Versilov without going into detail. Vasin heard me out attentively but with complete detachment. In general, he only answered when I asked him something, although he did so quite readily and pleasantly. As to the letter about which I had come to seek his advice earlier, I didn't mention it and told him that I'd just come to pay him a friendly visit before. I did this because since I'd given my word to Versilov that no one except me knew about the letter, I felt I had no right to mention it to anyone. Besides, there were certain subjects I could no longer discuss with Vasin without repugnance, although I still could talk to him easily enough about other things. I even managed to arouse his curiosity when I told him about the episode in the room next door, the screaming in the passage, and the final scene at Versilov's. He also listened very attentively when I told him about my meeting with Stebelkov. Indeed, he made me repeat twice about Stebelkov questioning me about the gathering at Dergachev's. Vasin pondered for a while in silence, but finally merely let out a short laugh. I had the very strong impression at that moment that nothing in the world could upset Vasin's perfect balance for long, and at first I rather admired him for it.","When they had brought in the tea I announced that I was going to ask for his hospitality for one night only, and if this were impossible I hoped he would say so, and I would go to an hotel. Then I briefly explained my reasons, simply and frankly stating that I had finally quarrelled with Versilov, without, however, going into details. Vassin listened attentively but without the slightest excitement. As a rule he only spoke in reply to questions, though he always answered with ready courtesy and sufficient detail. I said nothing at all about the letter concerning which I had come to ask his advice in the morning, and I explained that I had looked in then simply to call on him. Having given Versilov my word that no one else should know of the letter, I considered I had no right to speak of it to anyone. I felt it for some reason peculiarly repugnant to speak of certain things to Vassin—of some things and not of others; I succeeded, for instance, in interesting him in my description of the scenes that had taken place that morning in the passage, in the next room, and finally at Versilov's. He listened with extreme attention, especially to what I told him of Stebelkov. When I told him how Stebelkov asked about Dergatchev he made me repeat the question again, and seemed to ponder gravely over it, though he did laugh in the end. It suddenly occurred to me at that moment that nothing could ever have disconcerted Vassin; I remember, however, that this idea presented itself at first in a form most complimentary to him."

"Совсем другая особа была дочь Версилова. Высокая, немного даже худощавая; продолговатое и замечательно бледное лицо, но волосы черные, пышные; глаза темные, большие, взгляд глубокий; малые и алые губы, свежий рот. Первая женщина, которая мне не внушала омерзения походкой; впрочем, она была тонка и сухощава. Выражение лица не совсем доброе, но важное; двадцать два года. Почти ни одной наружной черты сходства с Версиловым, а между тем, каким-то чудом, необыкновенное сходство с ним в выражении физиономии. Не знаю, хороша ли она собой; тут как на вкус. Обе были одеты очень скромно, так что не стоит описывать. Я ждал, что буду тотчас обижен каким-нибудь взглядом Версиловой или жестом, и приготовился; обидел же меня ее брат в Москве, с первого же нашего столкновения в жизни. Она меня не могла знать в лицо, но, конечно, слышала, что я хожу к князю. Все, что предполагал или делал князь, во всей этой куче его родных и «ожидающих» тотчас же возбуждало интерес и являлось событием, – тем более его внезапное пристрастие ко мне. Мне положительно было известно, что князь очень интересовался судьбой Анны Андреевны и искал ей жениха. Но для Версиловой было труднее найти жениха, чем тем, которые вышивали по канве.","A completely different person was Versilov's daughter. Tall, even a little thin; an oblong and remarkably pale face, but black, luxuriant hair; eyes dark, large, deep look; small and scarlet lips, fresh mouth. The first woman who did not inspire disgust in my gait; however, she was thin and lean. The facial expression is not entirely kind, but important; Twenty-two years. Almost no outward feature of resemblance to Versilov, and meanwhile, by some miracle, an unusual resemblance to him in the expression of physiognomy. I don't know if she's pretty; here is how it tastes. Both were dressed very modestly, so there is no need to describe. I expected to be immediately offended by some look or gesture from Versilova, and I prepared myself; her brother offended me in Moscow, from the very first encounter in our lives. She could not know me by sight, but, of course, she heard that I was going to the prince. Everything that the prince assumed or did, in all this heap of his relatives and ""expecting"" immediately aroused interest and was an event, especially his sudden addiction to me. I positively knew that the prince was very interested in the fate of Anna Andreevna and was looking for a groom for her. But for Versilova it was more difficult to find a groom than for those who embroidered on canvas.","Versilov's daughter was quite a different matter. She was tall, rather on the slender side, with an oval and strikingly pale face framed by luxuriant black hair; her expression was not particularly friendly but very dignified; her age, twenty-two. It would be hard to pick out any one feature and say that it resembled Versilov's, although, as if by miracle, her over-all facial expression bore a striking resemblance to his. It would be hard for me to say whether she was beautiful. I suppose that's a matter of taste. Both girls were dressed modestly so there's no need for me to go into that. I was expecting Anna Versilov to make some sort of scornful gesture or to give me a humiliating look, as her brother did in Moscow the moment we met. Although she didn't know me by sight, she knew I had that job with the old prince. Whatever the prince did or planned to do immediately became a matter of great concern to the crowd of relatives and other people who were ""waiting."" . . . Everything was important and was discussed, especially his sudden liking for me. I know from most reliable sources that the prince was extremely anxious to assure Anna a happy future and was looking around for a bridegroom for her. But it was much more difficult to find a young man for Miss Versilov than for the young ladies who did embroidery.","Versilov's daughter was a very different person. She was tall and somewhat slim, with a long and strikingly pale face and splendid black hair. She had large dark eyes with an earnest expression, a small mouth, and most crimson lips. She was the first woman who did not disgust me by her horrid way of walking. She was thin and slender, however. Her expression was not altogether good-natured, but was dignified. She was twenty-two. There was hardly a trace of resemblance to Versilov in her features, and yet, by some miracle, there was an extraordinary similarity of expression. I do not know whether she was pretty; that is a matter of taste. They were both very simple in their dress, so that it is not worth while to describe it. I expected to be at once insulted by some glance or gesture of Mlle. Versilov, and I was prepared for it. Her brother had insulted me in Moscow the first time we ever met. She could hardly know me by sight, but no doubt she had heard I was in attendance on the prince. Whatever the prince did or proposed to do at once aroused interest and was looked upon as an event in the whole gang of his relations and expectant beneficiaries, and this was especially so with his sudden partiality for me. I knew for a fact that the old prince was particularly solicitous for Anna Andreyevna's welfare and was on the look-out for a husband for her. But it was more difficult to find a suitor for Mlle. Versilov than for the ladies who embroidered on canvas."
"Ни Альфонсинки, ни хозяина уже давно не было дома. Хозяйку я ни о чем не хотел расспрашивать, да и вообще положил прекратить с ними всякие сношения и даже съехать как можно скорей с квартиры; а потому, только что принесли мне кофей, я заперся опять на крючок. Но вдруг постучали в мою дверь; к удивлению моему, оказался Тришатов.","Neither Alfonsinka nor the owner had been home for a long time. I did not want to ask the landlady about anything, and in general I decided to stop all relations with them and even move out of the apartment as soon as possible; and therefore, as soon as they brought me coffee, I locked myself again on the hook. But suddenly there was a knock on my door; to my surprise, it turned out to be Trishatov.","Alphonsine and the landlord must have long since left the house. I didn't want to talk to the landlady. In fact, I'd made up my mind to cut all communications with them and to move out of there as soon as I could. And so, after they'd brought me my morning coffee, I bolted the door again. But soon someone knocked on the door and when I opened it, to my great surprise, I saw Trishatov.","Neither Alphonsine nor the landlord had been at the flat for a long time.

"Но все это – философия; воротимся к воображаемому романисту. Положение нашего романиста в таком случае было б совершенно определенное: он не мог бы писать в другом роде, как в историческом, ибо красивого типа уже нет в наше время, а если и остались остатки, то, по владычествующему теперь мнению, не удержали красоты за собою. О, и в историческом роде возможно изобразить множество еще чрезвычайно приятных и отрадных подробностей! Можно даже до того увлечь читателя, что он примет историческую картину за возможную еще и в настоящем. Такое произведение, при великом таланте, уже принадлежало бы не столько к русской литературе, сколько к русской истории. Это была бы картина, художественно законченная, русского миража, но существовавшего действительно, пока не догадались, что это – мираж. Внук тех героев, которые были изображены в картине, изображавшей русское семейство средневысшего культурного круга в течение трех поколений сряду и в связи с историей русской, – этот потомок предков своих уже не мог бы быть изображен в современном типе своем иначе, как в несколько мизантропическом, уединенном и несомненно грустном виде. Даже должен явиться каким-нибудь чудаком, которого читатель с первого взгляда мог бы признать как за сошедшего с поля и убедиться, что не за ним осталось поле. Еще далее – и исчезнет даже и этот внук-мизантроп; явятся новые лица, еще неизвестные, и новый мираж; но какие же лица? Если некрасивые, то невозможен дальнейший русский роман. Но увы! роман ли только окажется тогда невозможным?","But all this is philosophy; back to the imaginary novelist. The position of our novelist in this case would be quite definite: he could not write in a different genus, as in the historical one, for the beautiful type no longer exists in our time, and if there were remnants, then, according to the now dominant opinion, they could not keep beauty for yourself. Oh, and in historical terms it is possible to depict many more extremely pleasant and gratifying details! It is even possible to captivate the reader to such an extent that he will take the historical picture as possible even in the present. Such a work, with great talent, would already belong not so much to Russian literature as to Russian history. It would be a picture, artistically finished, of a Russian mirage, but one that really existed until they guessed that it was a mirage. The grandson of those heroes who were depicted in the picture depicting the Russian family of the middle-higher cultural circle for three generations in a row and in connection with Russian history - this descendant of his ancestors could no longer be depicted in his modern type otherwise than in a somewhat misanthropic, solitary and undeniably sad. He must even appear as some kind of eccentric, whom the reader at first glance could recognize as having left the field and make sure that the field was not left behind him. Still further - and even this misanthropic grandson will disappear; new faces will appear, still unknown, and a new mirage; but what kind of faces? If they are ugly, then a further Russian romance is impossible. But alas! will the romance only then prove impossible?","""But all this is just philosophizing; let's get back to our hypothetical novelist. His position would be perfectly clear: today he would have no choice but to write historical novels because in our time the 'beautiful' type is no longer to be found and, even if then; were still some remnants around, they wouldn't be considered 'beautiful' by the stand-ards prevalent today. Certainly, in historical novels, on the other hand, it would still be possible to create a great many pleasing and reassuring episodes. Indeed, the reader might be sufficiently taken in to believe that a scene from past history could take place in the present. And, provided the writer had great talent, such a book would belong less to Russian literature than to Russian history. For it would be an artistically convincing picture of a Russian illusion, but an illusion that really existed until some people decided that it had never been anything but an illusion. A member of the third generation in a three-generation saga of a cultured Russian upper-middle-class family in proper historical setting could be portrayed in his contemporary aspect only as a rather misanthropic and lonely type and certainly a sad sight to behold. Indeed, he'd strike the reader as some sort of freak, a deviation from the line of his forebears, someone doomed without a future. Very soon this misanthropic descendant would also vanish and new, different, and as yet unknown characters would appear on the scene, and in his wake would come a new illusion. But what sort of faces would these characters have? If they were ugly, there would be no future for the Russian novel. And, alas, it wouldn't be just the novel that would be impossible then!","""But all this is theorising; let us come back to our supposed novelist. The position of our novelist in this case would be perfectly definite; he could not write in any other form but the historical, for there is no fine type in our day, and if there were remnants of it left they would not, according to the prevalent ideas of the day, have retained their beauty. Oh! and in historical form it is possible to depict a multitude of extremely attractive and consolatory details! It is possible so to fascinate the reader indeed that he will take the historical picture for the possible and the actual. Such a work, if executed with great talent, would belong not so much to Russian literature as to Russian history. ""It would be a picture artistically worked out of the Russian ideal, having a real existence so long as it was not guessed that it was an ideal. The grandson of those heroes who have been depicted in a picture of a Russian family of the upper middle cultivated class during three generations, side by side with and in connection with Russian history —that descendant of his forefathers would not be depicted in his modern type except in a somewhat misanthropic solitary and distinctly melancholy aspect. He is even bound to appear a somewhat strange figure, so that the reader might from the first glance recognise him as one retreating from the field of action, and might be convinced there was no field of action left for him. A little further and even that misanthrope, that grandson of heroes, will disappear entirely; new characters will appear, unknown to us as yet, and a new ideal; but what sort of characters? If they are without beauty, then the Russian novel is impossible in the future. But alas! will the novel be the only thing impossible?"

"Как, неужели все? Да мне вовсе не о том было нужно; я ждал другого, главного, хотя совершенно понимал, что и нельзя было иначе. Я со свечой стал провожать его на лестницу; подскочил было хозяин, но я, потихоньку от Версилова, схватил его изо всей силы за руку и свирепо оттолкнул. Он поглядел было с изумлением, но мигом стушевался.","How, is it all? Yes, I didn’t need to talk about that at all; I was waiting for something else, the main thing, although I completely understood that it could not have been otherwise. I began to escort him up the stairs with a candle; the owner was about to jump up, but I, on the sly from Versilov, grabbed him by the arm with all my might and pushed him savagely. He looked at him in astonishment, but immediately hesitated.","Was that all he had to say to me? It was not at all what I'd wanted really. I'd expected him to talk to me about really important matters. But I resigned myself; he probably couldn't bring them up this time. I picked up the candle and saw him off to the landing. The landlord came running out and was about to join us, but I grabbed him by the arm while Versilov's back was turned and violently pushed him away. He gave me a puzzled look but made himself scarce. ""Ah, these staircases . . .","Could this be all? This was not at all what I wanted. I was expecting something different, something important, though I quite understood that this was how it must be. I got up with a candle to light him down the stairs. The landlord would have come forward, but without Versilov's seeing it I seized him by the arm and thrust him back savagely. He stared with astonishment, but immediately vanished."
"Вошли две дамы, обе девицы, одна – падчерица одного двоюродного брата покойной жены князя, или что-то в этом роде, воспитанница его, которой он уже выделил приданое и которая (замечу для будущего) и сама была с деньгами; вторая – Анна Андреевна Версилова, дочь Версилова, старше меня тремя годами, жившая с своим братом у Фанариотовой и которую я видел до этого времени всего только раз в моей жизни, мельком на улице, хотя с братом ее, тоже мельком, уже имел в Москве стычку (очень может быть, и упомяну об этой стычке впоследствии, если место будет, потому что в сущности не стоит). Эта Анна Андреевна была с детства своего особенною фавориткой князя (знакомство Версилова с князем началось ужасно давно). Я был так смущен только что происшедшим, что, при входе их, даже не встал, хотя князь встал им навстречу; а потом подумал, что уж стыдно вставать, и остался на месте. Главное, я был сбит тем, что князь так закричал на меня три минуты назад, и все еще не знал: уходить мне или нет. Но старик мой уже все забыл совсем, по своему обыкновению, и весь приятно оживился при виде девиц. Он даже, с быстро переменившейся физиономией и как-то таинственно подмигивая, успел прошептать мне наскоро пред самым их входом:","Two ladies entered, both girls, one - the stepdaughter of one cousin of the late wife of the prince, or something like that, his pupil, to whom he had already allocated a dowry and who (I will note for the future) was herself with money; the second is Anna Andreevna Versilova, Versilov's daughter, three years older than me, who lived with her brother at Fanariotova's, and whom I had seen until that time only once in my life, briefly on the street, although with her brother, also briefly, I had already met in Moscow skirmish (very likely, and I will mention this skirmish later if there is a place, because in essence it is not worth it). This Anna Andreyevna had been her special favorite of the prince since childhood (Versilov's acquaintance with the prince began terribly long ago). I was so embarrassed by what had just happened that, at their entrance, I did not even get up, although the prince stood up to meet them; and then he thought it was too embarrassing to get up, and remained where he was. The main thing was that I was brought down by the fact that the prince shouted at me like that three minutes ago, and still did not know whether I should leave or not. But my old man had already completely forgotten everything, as was his custom, and was all pleasantly perked up at the sight of the girls. He even, with a rapidly changing physiognomy and somehow mysteriously winking, managed to whisper to me hastily before their very entrance:","Two young ladies walked in. One was a stepdaughter of a cousin of the old prince's late wife or something like that, in any case a protegee of his for whom he had already set aside a dowry, although she had money herself (I mention this here for future reference). The other young lady was my half-sister Anna Andreyevna Versilov, my senior by three years, who lived with her brother at Mrs. Fanariotov's. I'd seen her only once before, very fleetingly in the street, although I had already had a brief clash with her brother in Moscow, which I may describe later if there's room since it's really quite unimportant. Anna Versilov had been, since her early childhood, the old prince's favorite (for the prince and Versilov had known each other an awfully long time). I was so intimidated by them that I forgot to stand up when they came in, but the old prince did so, in fact he rushed to meet them. After that, I decided it was too late to get up and so remained seated. I must say I was quite perplexed by my situation at that moment, since a minute earlier the prince had raised his voice at me and I was hesitating whether to walk out or not. But the old man had by now forgotten all about that and was beaming with joy and delight, as he always did in the presence of pretty young girls. His face had changed with the usual speed. Indeed, he was now winking mysteriously at me and even managed to mumble quickly under his breath:","Two ladies came in. They were both young and unmarried. One was a stepdaughter of a cousin of the old prince's deceased wife or something of the sort, a protégée of his for whom he had already set aside a dowry, and who (I mention it with a view to later events) had money herself: the other was Anna Andreyevna Versilov, the daughter of Versilov, three years older than I. She lived with her brother in the family of Mme. Fanariotov. I had only seen her once before in my life, for a minute in the street, though I had had an encounter, also very brief, with her brother in Moscow. (I may very possibly refer to this encounter later—if I have space, that is, for it is hardly worth recording.) Anna Andreyevna had been from childhood a special favourite of the old prince (Versilov's acquaintance with the prince dated from very long ago). I was so overcome by what had just happened that I did not even stand up on their entrance, though the old prince rose to greet them. Afterwards I thought it would be humiliating to get up, and I remained where I was. What overwhelmed me most was the prince's having shouted at me like that three minutes before, and I did not know whether to go away or not. But the old man, as usual, had already forgotten everything, and was all pleasure and animation at sight of the young ladies. At the very moment of their entrance he hurriedly whispered to me, with a rapid change of expression and a mysterious wink:"

"Но он простоял недолго, не успел и проговорить, как вдруг костыль его, на который он упирался всею тяжестью тела, как-то скользнул по ковру, и так как «ноженьки» почти совсем не держали его, то и грохнулся он со всей высоты на пол. Это почти ужасно было видеть, я помню. Все ахнули и бросились его поднимать, но, слава Богу, он не разбился; он только грузно, со звуком, стукнулся об пол обоими коленями, но успел-таки уставить перед собою правую руку и на ней удержаться. Его подняли и посадили на кровать. Он очень побледнел, не от испуга, а от сотрясения. (Доктор находил в нем, сверх всего другого, и болезнь сердца.) Мама же была вне себя от испуга. И вдруг Макар Иванович, все еще бледный, с трясущимся телом и как бы еще не опомнившись, повернулся к Лизе и почти нежным, тихим голосом проговорил ей:","But he did not stand for long, before he even had time to speak, when suddenly his crutch, on which he rested with all the weight of his body, somehow slid along the carpet, and since the “legs” almost did not hold him at all, he crashed from all heights on floor. It was almost terrible to see, I remember. Everyone gasped and rushed to pick it up, but, thank God, it did not break; he only hit the floor heavily, with a sound, with both knees, but still managed to put his right hand in front of him and hold on to it. He was lifted up and placed on the bed. He turned very pale, not from fright, but from concussion. (The doctor found in him, above all else, heart disease.) Mama was beside herself with fright. And suddenly Makar Ivanovich, still pale, with a trembling body, and as if not yet coming to his senses, turned to Liza and in an almost tender, quiet voice said to her:","But his triumph didn't last long and, before he could finish his sentence, the crutch that was supporting the whole weight of his body slipped on the carpet, and since his ""poor legs"" were in reality hardly supporting him, he fell heavily full length on the floor. I remember the heartbreaking scene clearly. A moan came out of everybody's lips and we all rushed toward him to help him up. Thank God, there were no broken bones, although he had fallen heavily, both his knees hitting the floor with a loud thud. Still, he had had time to stretch out his right arm and thus soften his fall a little. We lifted him up and sat him on his bed. He was very pale, but certainly not from fright, rather from the shock, because, on top of everything else, the doctor had discovered he had heart trouble as well. Mother was ashen also, but in her case it was from fear. Suddenly Makar, still white and his whole body trembling, turned toward Lisa and said in an almost tender voice:","But he did not remain standing long; he had hardly finished speaking, when his crutch, on which he was leaning with the whole weight of his body, somehow slipped on the rug, and as his ""poor legs"" were scarcely any support at all, he fell heavily full length on the floor. I remember it was almost horrible to see. All cried out, and rushed to lift him up, but, thank God, he had broken no bones; he had only knocked his knees with a heavy thud against the floor, but he had succeeded in putting out his right hand and breaking his fall with it. He was picked up and seated on the bed. He was very pale, not from fright, but from the shock. (The doctor had told them that he was suffering more from disease of the heart than anything.) Mother was beside herself with fright, and still pale, trembling all over and still a little bewildered, Makar Ivanovitch turned suddenly to Liza, and almost tenderly, in a soft voice, said to her:"
"– А что же вы, мама, мне про нашего дорогого гостя ничего не сказали? – спросил я вдруг, сам почти не ожидая, что так скажу. Все беспокойство разом исчезло с лица ее, и на нем вспыхнула как бы радость, но она мне ничего не ответила, кроме одного только слова:","- And why didn’t you, mother, tell me about our dear guest? I suddenly asked, almost not expecting myself to say so. All anxiety vanished from her face at once, and a kind of joy flared up on it, but she answered me nothing, except for one word:","""Mamma, why didn't you tell me about our wonderful guest?"" The words came out by themselves, almost without my being aware of what I was saying. But they swept all the uneasiness from Mother's face and caused joy to flash in it. But she only said:","""Why did you tell me nothing about our dear guest, mother?"" I asked suddenly, not knowing I was going to say it. All the uneasiness vanished from her face at once, and there was a flush as it were of joy, but she made me no reply except the words:"
"Он сходил и принес ответ странный, что Анна Андреевна и князь Николай Иванович с нетерпением ожидают меня к себе; Анна Андреевна, значит, не захотела пожаловать. Я оправил и почистил мой смявшийся за ночь сюртук, умылся, причесался, все это не торопясь, и, понимая, как надобно быть осторожным, отправился к старику.","He went down and brought a strange answer, that Anna Andreyevna and Prince Nikolai Ivanovich were looking forward to seeing me; Anna Andreevna, therefore, did not want to come. I straightened and brushed my frock coat, wrinkled during the night, washed, combed my hair, all this without haste, and, realizing how careful one must be, went to the old man.","He went out and came back with a peculiar answer: Miss Versilov and the prince were anxiously waiting for me themselves. That meant that Anna didn't wish to pay me a private visit. So I brushed and smoothed out my coat, which was all creased since I'd slept in it all night, washed and combed my hair. I did everything very deliberately and unhurriedly, for I realized how careful I had to be now. And when I was ready I went in to see them.","He went and brought the strange reply ""that Anna Andreyevna and Prince Nikolay Ivanitch were impatiently expecting me in the next room""; so Anna Andreyevna would not come. I smoothed out my coat, which was creased from sleeping in it that night, brushed it, washed, combed my hair; I did all this deliberately, realising how necessary it was to be careful, and I went in to the old prince."
"– Оставим, – сказал Версилов, странно посмотрев на меня (именно так, как смотрят на человека непонимающего и неугадывающего), – кто знает, что у них там есть, и кто может знать, что с ними будет? Я не про то: я слышал, ты завтра хотел бы выйти. Не зайдешь ли к князю Сергею Петровичу?","“Let’s leave it,” said Versilov, looking at me strangely (exactly the way one looks at a person who doesn’t understand and doesn’t guess), “who knows what they have there, and who can know what will happen to them? I'm not talking about that: I heard you would like to go out tomorrow. Would you like to visit Prince Sergei Petrovich?","""Well, let's leave it for now,"" Versilov said, looking at me the way one looks at someone who neither knows nor understands what's going on, ""who can tell what they were up to and what will be done to them . . . ? But that's not what I wanted to talk to you about. ... I heard you were planning to go out tomorrow. I was wondering whether you wouldn't drop in on Sergei?""","""We won't go into it,"" said Versilov, looking at me strangely (as people look at a man who has no knowledge or suspicion of something). ""Who can tell what is going on among them, and who can tell what may happen to them? I didn't come to speak of that. I hear you meant to go out to-morrow. Won't you be going to see Prince Sergay?"""

"Но пока я молчал и даже решился ничего не обдумывать! Я все заглядывал в их лица, стараясь по ним угадать все, что мне надо было. Видно было, что и они не желали ни расспрашивать, ни любопытствовать, а говорили со мной совсем о постороннем. Мне это нравилось и в то же время огорчало меня; не буду объяснять это противоречие. Лизу я видел реже, чем маму, хотя она заходила ко мне каждый день, даже по два раза. Из отрывков их разговора и из всего их вида я заключил, что у Лизы накопилось страшно много хлопот и что она даже часто дома не бывает из-за своих дел: уже в одной этой идее о возможности «своих дел» как бы заключалось для меня нечто обидное; впрочем, все это были лишь больные, чисто физиологические ощущения, которые не стоит описывать. Татьяна Павловна тоже приходила ко мне чуть не ежедневно, и хоть была вовсе не нежна со мной, но по крайней мере не ругалась по-прежнему, что до крайности меня раздосадовало, так что я ей просто высказал: «Вы, Татьяна Павловна, когда не ругаетесь, прескучная». – «Ну, так и не приду к тебе», – оторвала она и ушла. А я был рад, что хоть одну прогнал.","But while I was silent and even decided not to think about anything! I kept looking into their faces, trying to guess everything I needed from them. It was evident that they, too, did not wish to question or inquire, but were talking to me about completely unrelated matters. I liked it and at the same time saddened me; I will not explain this contradiction. I saw Lisa less often than my mother, although she came to see me every day, even twice. From the fragments of their conversation and from their whole appearance, I concluded that Liza had an awful lot of troubles and that she was even often not at home because of her own affairs: already in this very idea of the possibility of ""own affairs"" something seemed to be contained for me. offensive; however, all these were only sick, purely physiological sensations that are not worth describing. Tatyana Pavlovna also came to see me almost daily, and although she was not at all gentle with me, at least she did not swear as before, which annoyed me to the extreme, so I simply told her: “You, Tatyana Pavlovna, when you don’t swear, boring."" “Well, I won’t come to you,” she snapped and left. And I was glad that at least one drove away.","But I said nothing and even made an effort not to think about these matters. I just looked intently into the faces of those around me and tried to guess what I needed to know. It was obvious that they didn't want to question me; indeed, they even tried not to show any curiosity, and when they spoke to me, it was always about unimportant things. I liked that and yet it made me sad, but I didn't try to analyze that ambivalent feeling. I saw more of Mother than of Lisa, although Lisa too came in to see me at least twice a day. From the exchanges between the two of them and from Lisa's expression, I gathered that Lisa was extremely tense, that she spent most of her days away somewhere attending to matters that concerned her personally. The very thought that she could have personal preoccupations somehow offended me, although, of course, these were just the purely physiological reactions of a sick man and are certainly not worth describing. Mrs. Prutkov also came to see me, almost daily in fact, and, although she didn't treat me with anything resembling tenderness, at least she didn't berate me as she had before. That exasperated me so much that I couldn't help telling her: ""You know, Mrs. Prutkov, I now realize that when you don't abuse people you're an awful bore."" ""If that's the way it is, I won't come to see you any more,"" she answered gruffly, and walked out. I was very pleased: I had succeeded in getting rid of at least one of them.","But for the time I held my peace, and even made up my mind not to think of anything! I kept peeping at their faces, trying to guess from them all I wanted to know. It was evident that they too did not want to ask questions or be inquisitive, but talked of something irrelevant. This pleased me and at the same time mortified me; I won't attempt to explain the contradiction. I did not see Liza so often as my mother, though she came in to see me every day, and indeed twice a day. From fragments of their talk and from their whole air I gathered that Liza had a great deal on her hands and that she was indeed often absent from home on business of her own: the very fact that she could have ""business of her own"" was something like a grievance to me; but all these were morbid, purely physical, sensations, which are not worth describing. Tatyana Pavlovna came, too, almost daily to see me, and though she was by no means tender with me, she did not abuse me as usual, which annoyed me extremely—so much so that I said to her openly: ""You know, Tatyana Pavlovna, when you're not scolding you are very tedious."" ""Well, then, I won't come and see you,"" she blurted out, and went away. And I was pleased that I had got rid of one of them, at least."

"Был второй час в начале. Я поспешил по адресу пешком. Вот уже третий год как я не беру извозчиков – такое дал слово (иначе не скопил бы шестидесяти рублей). Я никогда не ходил на аукционы, я еще не позволял себе этого; и хоть теперешний «шаг» мой был только примерный, но и к этому шагу я положил прибегнуть лишь тогда, когда кончу с гимназией, когда порву со всеми, когда забьюсь в скорлупу и стану совершенно свободен. Правда, я далеко был не в «скорлупе» и далеко еще не был свободен; но ведь и шаг я положил сделать лишь в виде пробы – как только, чтоб посмотреть, почти как бы помечтать, а потом уж не приходить, может, долго, до самого того времени, когда начнется серьезно. Для всех это был только маленький, глупенький аукцион, а для меня – то первое бревно того корабля, на котором Колумб поехал открывать Америку. Вот мои тогдашние чувства.","It was the second hour at the beginning. I hurried to the address on foot. For the third year now I have not taken cabs - this is my word (otherwise I would not have saved sixty rubles). I have never gone to auctions, I have not yet allowed myself to; and although my current “step” was only an exemplary one, I decided to resort to this step only when I finished with the gymnasium, when I broke with everyone, when I hid in a shell and became completely free. True, I was far from being in a ""shell"" and far from being free; but after all, I decided to take a step only in the form of a test - as soon as to look, almost as if dreaming, and then not to come, maybe for a long time, until the very time when it starts in earnest. For everyone it was just a small, stupid auction, but for me it was the first log of the ship on which Columbus went to discover America. Here are my feelings at the time.","It was just after one. I hurried over to the address. I went on foot, for I hadn't taken a cab for more than two years. I had promised myself not to and that's how I'd managed to save money in Moscow. I'd never been to an auction before , I'd never allowed myself to go to one. And although my present step was only a trial move, I felt that, to take it, I should first graduate from high school, break off relations with everyone, retire into my shell, and thus be completely independent. It's true that I was nowhere near being enclosed in a shell or, for that matter, independent, but then the step I was going to take was just an experiment to try to get the feel of it, to indulge in a bit of fancy, and then I'd stay away from it, perhaps until the day when I'd be able to get down to it in earnest. To everyone else this was just a silly little auction, but to me it was the first rib of the ship that Columbus would sail to discover America. That's how I felt then.","It was just past one. I hurried to the address on foot. I had not taken a cab for more than two years—I had taken a vow not to ( or I should never have saved up my sixty roubles). I had never been to an auction , I had never ALLOWED myself this indulgence. And though my present step was only an EXPERIMENT yet I had made up my mind not to take even that step till I had left the grammar school, when I should break off with everything, hide myself in my shell, and become perfectly free. It is true that I was far from being in my shell and far from being free yet, but then I was only taking this step by way of an experiment—simply to look into it, as it were to indulge a fancy, and after that not to recur to it perhaps for a long while, till the time of beginning seriously. For every one else this was only a stupid little auction, but for me it was the first plank in the ship in which a Columbus would set out to discover his America. That was my feeling then."
"Одним словом, я не знаю, к кому я ее ревновал; но я чувствовал только и убедился в вчерашний вечер, как дважды два, что она для меня пропала, что эта женщина меня оттолкнет и осмеет за фальшь и за нелепость! Она – правдивая и честная, а я – я шпион и с документами!","In a word, I do not know to whom I was jealous of her; but I only felt and was convinced last night, like twice two, that she was gone for me, that this woman would repel me and ridicule me for falseness and absurdity! She is truthful and honest, and I am a spy with documents!","Well, I don't really know whom I was jealous of. But after that night, I felt that I'd lost her—as surely as two times two is four—and I knew that she'd reject me now and laugh at me for my hypocrisy and idiocy! Ah, she who was so honest and truthful, and I, a blackmailing spy trying to take advantage of a compromising document!","In short, I don't know of whom I was jealous on her account; but all I felt and knew the evening before was that as certainly as twice two make four, she was lost to me, that that woman would spurn me and laugh at me for falseness and absurdity!

"Читатель, конечно, подумает, что я был в ужаснейшем расположении, выйдя от Ефима, и, однако, ошибется. Я слишком понял, что вышел случай школьнический, гимназический, а серьезность дела остается вся целиком. Кофею я напился уже на Васильевском острове, нарочно миновав вчерашний мой трактир на Петербургской; и трактир этот, и соловей стали для меня вдвое ненавистнее. Странное свойство: я способен ненавидеть места и предметы, точно как будто людей. Зато есть у меня в Петербурге и несколько мест счастливых, то есть таких, где я почему-нибудь бывал когда-нибудь счастлив, – и что же, я берегу эти места и не захожу в них как можно дольше нарочно, чтобы потом, когда буду уже совсем один и несчастлив, зайти погрустить и припомнить. За кофеем я отдал вполне справедливость Ефиму и здравому смыслу его. Да, он был практичнее меня, но вряд ли реальнее. Реализм, ограничивающийся кончиком своего носа, опаснее самой безумной фантастичности, потому что слеп. Но, отдавая справедливость Ефиму (который, вероятно, в ту минуту думал, что я иду по улице и ругаюсь), – я все-таки ничего не уступил из убеждений, как не уступлю до сих пор. Видал я таких, что из-за первого ведра холодной воды не только отступаются от поступков своих, но даже от идеи, и сами начинают смеяться над тем, что, всего час тому, считали священным; о, как у них это легко делается! Пусть Ефим, даже и в сущности дела, был правее меня, а я глупее всего глупого и лишь ломался, но все же в самой глубине дела лежала такая точка, стоя на которой, был прав и я, что-то такое было и у меня справедливого и, главное, чего они никогда не могли понять.","The reader will, of course, think that I was in the most terrible position when I left Yefim, but, however, they will be mistaken. I understood only too well that it was a case of a schoolboy, a gymnasium, but the seriousness of the case remains entirely. I drank coffee already on Vasilievsky Island, purposely passing by yesterday my tavern on Petersburgskaya; This tavern and the nightingale have become twice as hateful to me. Strange property: I am able to hate places and objects, just like people. On the other hand, I also have a few happy places in Petersburg, that is, places where for some reason I have been happy at some time - and well, I protect these places and do not go into them as long as possible on purpose, so that later, when I already completely alone and unhappy, go to mourn and remember. Over coffee I did justice to Yefim and his common sense. Yes, he was more practical than me, but hardly more real. Realism, limited to the tip of its nose, is more dangerous than the most insane fantasy, because it is blind. But, to do justice to Yefim (who, probably, at that moment thought that I was walking down the street and swearing), I still didn’t yield anything from my convictions, as I still won’t yield. I have seen such people who, because of the first bucket of cold water, not only retreat from their deeds, but even from their idea, and themselves begin to laugh at what, just an hour ago, they considered sacred; Oh, how easy it is for them! Even though Yefim, even in the essence of the matter, was more right than me, and I was more stupid than anything stupid and only broke down, but nevertheless, in the very depths of the matter there was such a point, standing on which I was right, I had something like that fair and, most importantly, what they could never understand.","The reader may imagine that I was completely dejected as I left Zverev's house, but he'd be quite wrong. I was well aware that what had happened was just schoolboy horseplay that could not in the least weaken my determination to see my plans through. I had breakfast on Vasilievsky Island, deliberately bypassing the tavern on the Petersburg Side where I had had supper the previous evening because the mere recollection of that place with its nightingale had become sickening to me. I have a rather strange trait: I can hate locales and objects just as I hate people. On the other hand, I have a few ""happy"" places in Petersburg, places where for some reason or other I've once felt happy. And, you know what, I sort of save those places, stay away from them as much as I can, so that some day when I feel really low and lonely, I can go there with my sadness and relive happier memories. While I was having breakfast I thought of Efim Zverev and gave him due credit for his common sense. Yes, he was certainly more practical than me but hardly more of a realist. Realism that refuses to see beyond the tip of its nose is like a sort of blindness and is more dangerous than the most fantastic imagination. But while rendering Zverev his due (he probably imagined me now walking along the street swearing at him), I still did not yield to his arguments; indeed, I haven't to this day. I know enough people who are prepared to renounce their efforts and even their ideas as soon as a bucket of cold water is thrown over their heads and who begin to laugh at things they'd considered sacred an hour earlier. Oh, everything is so easy for people like that! Even assuming that Zverev's view of the whole business was sounder than mine, even conceding that I was very stupid and was just striking a pose—still, deep down, there was a point on which I was right and there was something in my position that was just and correct, and , what is most important, something that they'd never be able to understand.","The reader will doubtless imagine that I was in a terrible state of mind when I came out from Efim's; he will be mistaken, however. I quite realized that what had happened was only schoolboyishness, but the gravity of my purpose remained unchanged. I got some coffee at Vassilyevsky Island, purposely avoiding the restaurant I had been at the evening before on the Petersburg Side; the restaurant and its nightingale were doubly hateful to me. It is a strange characteristic of mine that I am capable of hating places and things as though they were people. On the other hand I have happy places in Petersburg, that is places where I have at some time or other been happy. And I am careful of those places, and purposely avoid visiting them as far as possible, that later on when I am alone and unhappy I may go back to them to brood over my griefs and my memories. Over my coffee I did full justice to Efim and his common sense. Yes, he was more practical than I was, but I doubt whether he was in closer touch with reality. A realism that refuses to look beyond the end of its nose is more dangerous than the maddest romanticism, because it is blind. But while I did justice to Efim (who probably at that moment imagined that I was wandering about the streets swearing)—I did not give up one point in my convictions, and I have not to this day. I have seen people who at the first bucket of cold water have abandoned their course of action, and even their idea, and begun laughing themselves at what an hour before they looked upon as sacred. Oh, how easily that is done! Even if Efim were more right than I in the main, and I were foolish beyond all foolishness and giving myself airs, yet at the very bottom of it all there was a point of view upon which I was right: there was something to be said on my side also, and what is more, too, it was something they could never understand."

"Но я не мог ни думать толком, ни спрашивать. Я уже предуведомил выше, что, под конец этих дней, я был «раздавлен событиями»; я теперь сидел, и все как хаос вертелось в уме моем. «Да, я в нем все проглядел и ничего не уразумел, – мерещилось мне минутами. – Он засмеялся сейчас мне в глаза: это не надо мной; тут все Бьоринг, а не я. Третьего дня за обедом уж он все знал и был мрачен. Он подхватил у меня мою глупую исповедь в трактире и исказил все насчет всякой правды, только зачем ему было правды? Он ни полслову сам не верит из того, что ей написал. Ему надо было только оскорбить, бессмысленно оскорбить, не зная даже для чего, придравшись к предлогу, а предлог дал я… Поступок бешеной собаки! Убить, что ли, он теперь хочет Бьоринга? Для чего? Его сердце знает для чего! А я ничего не знаю, что в его сердце… Нет, нет, и теперь не знаю. Неужели до такой страсти ее любит? или до такой страсти ее ненавидит? Я не знаю, а знает ли он сам-то? Что это я сказал маме, что с ним „ничего не может сделаться“; что я этим хотел сказать? Потерял я его или не потерял?»","But I couldn't think straight, I couldn't ask. I have already warned above that, towards the end of these days, I was ""crushed by events""; I was sitting now, and everything was spinning like chaos in my mind. “Yes, I overlooked everything in it and understood nothing,” it seemed to me for minutes. - He just laughed into my eyes: it's not over me; it's all Björing, not me. On the third day at dinner, he already knew everything and was gloomy. He took my stupid confession from me in the tavern and distorted everything about any truth, but why did he need the truth? He doesn't believe a word of what he wrote to her. He only had to insult, senselessly insult, not even knowing why, finding fault with the pretext, and I gave the pretext ... The act of a mad dog! Kill, or what, he now wants Bjoring? For what? His heart knows why! And I don’t know anything about what’s in his heart… No, no, and now I don’t know. Does he really love her so passionately? Or does he hate her so passionately? I don't know, does he know himself? What did I say to my mother that “nothing could be done” to him; what did I mean by that? Did I lose it or didn't I?","Besides, I wasn't in a state to think sensibly. As I said earlier, I felt crushed after the events of those few days. So I just sat there with odd bits of thoughts whirling chaotically around in my head: ""I never saw what he was really after, never understood him""—the words flashed through my mind again and again. "" He laughed in my face just now, but it wasn't at me he was laughing—it was at Bjoring, it's all Bjoring and not me. . . . Two days ago at dinner, he already knew everything and looked dejected. In that inn, he got that stupid confession out of me and then distorted it until there was no truth left in it. . . . But what does he care about truth? He himself doesn't believe a single word of what he wrote. All he wanted was to insult, insult wantonly, and all he needed was a pretext and I supplied him with that pretext. . . . He's like a mad dog! Unless he wants to kill Bjoring? Why? His heart must know why! But I know nothing of what's going on in his heart! . . . No, no, I still don't know! Can it be that he loves her with such a passion? Or hates her with such a passion? I don't know and perhaps he doesn't know himself. . . . Why did I tell Mother that nothing could happen to him? What did I mean by that? Have I lost him? Is there a hope left that I haven't?","But I could not myself answer the question, or think about it rationally.

"" He laughed in my face just now: that was not at me, it was all Büring then, not me. The day before yesterday he knew everything and he was gloomy. He pounced on my stupid confession in the restaurant, and distorted it, regardless of the truth; but what did he care for the truth? He did not believe a syllable of what he wrote to her. All he wanted was to insult her, to insult her senselessly, without knowing what for; he was looking out for a pretext and I gave him the pretext… . He behaved like a mad dog! Does he want to kill Büring now? What for? His heart knows what for! And I know nothing of what's in his heart… . No, no, I don't know even now. Can it be that he loves her with such passion? Or does he hate her to such a pitch of passion? I don't know, but does he know himself? Why did I tell mother that 'nothing could happen to him'; what did I mean to say by that? Have I lost him or haven't I?"

"Здесь замечу в скобках о том, о чем узнал очень долго спустя: будто бы Бьоринг прямо предлагал Катерине Николаевне отвезти старика за границу, склонив его к тому как-нибудь обманом, объявив между тем негласно в свете, что он совершенно лишился рассудка, а за границей уже достать свидетельство об этом врачей. Но этого-то и не захотела Катерина Николаевна ни за что; так по крайней мере потом утверждали. Она будто бы с негодованием отвергнула этот проект. Все это – только самый отдаленный слух, но я ему верю.","Here I will note in brackets what I found out a very long time later: as if Björing directly offered Katerina Nikolaevna to take the old man abroad, inducing him to do so somehow by deception, meanwhile declaring behind the scenes in the public that he had completely lost his mind, and for border already to get a certificate of this doctors. But this is what Katerina Nikolaevna did not want for nothing; so at least then claimed. She seemed to reject the project with indignation. All this is only the most distant rumor, but I believe it.","Here I'll note parenthetically that much later I learned that Bjoring had suggested to Katerina that she somehow or other convince her father to go on a trip to Europe with her, meanwhile letting the rumor be spread in Petersburg society that he had become completely mentally irresponsible, and have him certified as such by doctors abroad. But Katerina categorically refused to do that, or at least so I was told later. Indeed, she supposedly rejected this scheme indignantly. All that is hearsay, but I believe it.","Here I may note in parenthesis what I only learnt long afterwards that Büring had bluntly proposed to Katerina Nikolaevna that they should take the old gentleman abroad, inducing him to go by some sort of strategy, letting people know privately meanwhile that he had gone out of his mind, and obtaining a doctor's certificate to that effect abroad. But Katerina Nikolaevna would not consent to that on any account; so at least it was declared afterwards. She seems to have rejected the project with indignation. All this is only a rather roundabout rumour, but I believe it."

"Я только помню из этих трех минут какую-то действительно прекрасную женщину, которую князь целовал и крестил рукой и которая вдруг быстро стала глядеть – так-таки прямо только что вошла – на меня. Я ясно расслышал, как князь, очевидно показав на меня, пробормотал что-то, с маленьким каким-то смехом, про нового секретаря и произнес мою фамилию. Она как-то вздернула лицо, скверно на меня посмотрела и так нахально улыбнулась, что я вдруг шагнул, подошел к князю и пробормотал, ужасно дрожа, не доканчивая ни одного слова, кажется стуча зубами:","I only remember from these three minutes some really beautiful woman, whom the prince kissed and baptized with his hand, and who suddenly quickly began to look - she had just just entered - at me. I clearly heard how the prince, obviously pointing at me, muttered something, with some kind of small laugh, about the new secretary and said my name. She somehow turned up her face, looked at me badly and smiled so insolently that I suddenly took a step, went up to the prince and muttered, trembling terribly, not finishing a single word, it seems chattering my teeth:","Of those three minutes I only remember the presence of an absolutely beautiful woman, whom the old prince hugged and kissed while making the sign of the cross over her, and who, almost from the moment she entered, quickly looked around the room and then fixed her eyes on me. I clearly heard the prince, apparently making a gesture toward me, murmur something about his ""new secretary"" and pronounce my name. She abruptly threw back her head and I received the full blast of her hostility; then suddenly a scornful smile flashed across her face. I took a few steps toward them and, when I was close enough to the old prince, trembling horribly, I started mumbling without being able to finish a single sentence.","I only remember from those three minutes the image of a really beautiful woman, whom the prince was kissing and signing with the cross, and who looked quickly at once—the very minute she came in— at me.

Her face seemed to contract; she threw a vicious glance at me, and smiled so insolently that I took a sudden step forward, went up to the prince, and muttered, trembling all over and unable to finish my words (I believe my teeth were chattering):"

"Я кончил. Может быть, иному читателю захотелось бы узнать: куда ж это девалась моя «идея» и что такое та новая, начинавшаяся для меня теперь жизнь, о которой я так загадочно возвещаю? Но эта новая жизнь, этот новый, открывшийся передо мною путь и есть моя же «идея», та самая, что и прежде, но уже совершенно в ином виде, так что ее уже и узнать нельзя. Но в «Записки» мои все это войти уже не может, потому что это – уже совсем другое. Старая жизнь отошла совсем, а новая едва начинается. Но прибавлю, однако, необходимое: Татьяна Павловна, искренний и любимый друг мой, пристает ко мне чуть не каждый день с увещаниями непременно и как можно скорее поступить в университет: «Потом, как кончишь учение, тогда и выдумывай, а теперь доучись». Признаюсь, я задумываюсь о ее предложении, но совершенно не знаю, чем решу. Между прочим, я возразил ей, что я даже и не имею теперь права учиться, потому что должен трудиться, чтобы содержать маму и Лизу; но она предлагает на то свои деньги и уверяет, что их достанет на все время моего университета. Я решился наконец спросить совета у одного человека. Рассмотрев кругом меня, я выбрал этого человека тщательно и критически. Это – Николай Семенович, бывший мой воспитатель в Москве, муж Марьи Ивановны. Не то чтобы я так нуждался в чьем-нибудь совете; но мне просто и неудержимо захотелось услышать мнение этого совершенно постороннего и даже несколько холодного эгоиста, но бесспорно умного человека. Я послал ему всю мою рукопись, прося секрета, потому что я не показывал еще ее никому, и в особенности Татьяне Павловне. Посланная рукопись прибыла ко мне обратно через две недели и при довольно длинном письме. Из письма этого сделаю лишь несколько выдержек, находя в них некоторый общий взгляд и как бы нечто разъяснительное. Вот эти выдержки.","I finished. Perhaps another reader would like to know: where did my “idea” go and what is that new life that is now beginning for me, about which I so mysteriously announce? But this new life, this new path that has opened up before me, is my own ""idea"", the same as before, but already in a completely different form, so that it can no longer be recognized. But all this can no longer be included in my Notes, because this is already completely different. The old life has departed completely, and the new one is barely beginning. But I will add, however, the necessary: Tatyana Pavlovna, my sincere and beloved friend, pesters me almost every day with exhortations to enter the university without fail and as soon as possible: “Then, when you finish your studies, then invent, and now finish your studies.” I confess, I think about her proposal, but I don’t know how I will decide. Incidentally, I objected to her that I did not even have the right to study now, because I had to work to support my mother and Lisa; but she offers her money for that and assures me that she will get it for the whole time of my university. I finally decided to ask advice from one person. Having looked around me, I chose this person carefully and critically. This is Nikolai Semenovich, my former tutor in Moscow, the husband of Marya Ivanovna. It's not that I'm in such need of anyone's advice; but I simply and irresistibly wanted to hear the opinion of this completely outsider and even somewhat cold egoist, but undeniably intelligent person. I sent him my entire manuscript, asking for a secret, because I had not yet shown it to anyone, and especially to Tatyana Pavlovna. The sent manuscript arrived back to me in two weeks and with a rather long letter. I will make only a few excerpts from this letter, finding in them a certain general view and, as it were, something explanatory. Here are the excerpts.","I have finished. Possibly some readers may wonder what happened to that ""idea"" of mine and what's so ""new"" about this ""new life"" I'm now living and about which I am being so mysterious. Well, that new life, the new path I have discovered and am now following, is precisely ""my idea,"" that very same old idea of mine but in such a completely different form that it is hardly recognizable. But all this cannot be included in these memoirs: it is a different story. My former life is over and a new life is just beginning. However, I must mention something essential: Tatyana Prutkov, my sincere and loving friend, keeps pestering me every day, insisting that I should now enter the university. ""First get on with your studies and when you've finished, there'll be plenty of time for you to think up all kinds of ideas."" I admit that what she says makes me stop and think, but I still haven't made up my mind. One of the reasons I gave Mrs. Prutkov for not entering the university was that I have no right to study when I should work to support Mother and Lisa. She, however, rejected that objection, assuring me that she'd take care of that and that she had enough money to do so until I graduated. Finally, I decided to seek advice, carefully and critically choosing the adviser. My final choice was Nikolai Semyonovich, who had been my guardian in Moscow and was the husband of my dear friend Maria. It was not that I really needed anyone's advice , I simply felt the desire to hear the opinion of an uninvolved observer; I knew he was a rather cold and selfish man, but beyond any doubt also highly intelligent. So I sent him my manuscript, which I hadn't yet shown to anybody, and asked him to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Prutkov. Two weeks later I received the manuscript back. It was accompanied by a longish letter. I will give a few excerpts from that letter here, for I believe they express Nikolai's general opinion of the situation and may perhaps shed some light on my story too:","I have finished. Perhaps some reader may care to know: what has become of my ""idea,"" and what is the new life that is beginning for me now, to which I refer so mysteriously? But that new life, that new way which is opening before me is my ""idea,"" the same as before, though in such a different form, that it could hardly be recognised. But I cannot enter into that in this story, that is something quite different. My old life has passed away completely, and the new is just beginning. But I will add one essential matter: Tatyana Pavlovna, a true and dear friend to me, pesters me almost every day with exhortations to enter the university: ""When you've taken your degree,"" she says, ""then you can consider the position, but now you must finish your studies. "" I must confess I am considering her suggestion, but I don't know how I shall decide. Among other objections I have urged that I have not the right to continue my studies, as it is my duty now to work to maintain mother and Liza; but she offers to undertake this, and she says her means are sufficient to do so all the time I am at the university. I have determined at last to ask the advice of some one. Looking about me, I have chosen that some one carefully and critically. I have fixed on Nikolay Semyonovitch, my former tutor in Moscow, the husband of Marie Ivanovna. Not so much that I need advice about anything, but I feel an irresistible longing to hear the opinion of this outsider, who is a rather coldly egoistic, but undoubtedly clever man. I have sent him my whole manuscript, asking him to keep it secret from every one, especially Tatyana Pavlovna, because I have not shown it to any one so far. The manuscript came back to me a fortnight later, and with it a rather long letter. From this letter I make a few extracts, as I find in them a certain general view and something that may be explanatory. Here are the extracts."
"У всякого человека, кто бы он ни был, наверно, сохраняется какое-нибудь воспоминание о чем-нибудь таком, с ним случившемся, на что он смотрит или наклонен смотреть, как на нечто фантастическое, необычайное, выходящее из ряда, почти чудесное, будет ли то – сон, встреча, гадание, предчувствие или что-нибудь в этом роде. Я до сих пор наклонен смотреть на эту встречу мою с Ламбертом как на нечто даже пророческое… судя по крайней мере по обстоятельствам и последствиям встречи. Все это произошло, впрочем, по крайней мере с одной стороны, в высшей степени натурально: он просто возвращался с одного ночного своего занятия (какого – объяснится потом), полупьяный, и в переулке, остановясь у ворот на одну минуту, увидел меня. Был же он в Петербурге всего только еще несколько дней.","Every person, whoever he may be, probably retains some memory of something that happened to him, which he looks at or is inclined to look at, as something fantastic, extraordinary, out of the ordinary, almost miraculous, will be whether it is a dream, a meeting, a fortune-telling, a presentiment, or something like that. I am still inclined to look at this meeting between me and Lambert as something even prophetic ... judging at least by the circumstances and consequences of the meeting. All this happened, however, at least on the one hand, in the highest degree naturally: he was simply returning from one of his nightly activities (which one - I will explain later), half drunk, and in the alley, stopping at the gate for one minute, he saw me. He was in St. Petersburg only a few more days.","Every person whoever he may be must have a memory of something that happened to him that he considers or likes to consider as fantastic, uncanny, extraordinary, almost miraculous—whether it be a dream, a meeting, a prediction, a foreboding, or whatever. And so, to this day, I am inclined to view this meeting of mine with Lambert as predestined, to judge at least from the circumstances surrounding it and its consequences, despite the fact that, in some respects, our encounter had nothing so extraordinary about it. Lambert was simply on his way home from certain nocturnal pursuits (the nature of which will be explained later). He was half drunk and stopped for a moment by a gate in a side street. And there he caught sight of me. He had arrived in Petersburg only a few days before.","Every man, whoever he may be, must certainly preserve a recollection of something which has happened to him, upon which he looks, or is inclined to look, as something fantastic, exceptional, outside the common order of things, almost miraculous, whether it be a dream, a meeting, a divination, a presentiment or anything of that kind. I am to this day inclined to look upon this meeting with Lambert as something almost supernatural … judging, that is, from the circumstances and consequences of that meeting. It all happened from one point of view, however, perfectly naturally; he was simply returning from one of his nocturnal pursuits (the nature of it will be explained later on) half-drunk, and stopping at the gate for a moment, caught sight of me. He had only been in Petersburg a few days."

"На другой день, ровно в одиннадцать часов, я явился в квартиру князя В—ского, холостую, но, как угадывалось мне, пышно меблированную, с лакеями в ливреях. Я остановился в передней. Из внутренних комнат долетали звуки громкого разговора и смеха: у князя, кроме камер-юнкера гостя, были и еще посетители. Я велел лакею о себе доложить, и, кажется, в немного гордых выражениях: по крайней мере, уходя докладывать, он посмотрел на меня странно, мне показалось, даже не так почтительно, как бы следовало. К удивлению моему, он что-то уж очень долго докладывал, минут с пять, а между тем оттуда все раздавались тот же смех и те же отзвуки разговора.","The next day, at precisely eleven o'clock, I appeared at Prince V-sky's apartment, unmarried, but, as I guessed, sumptuously furnished, with footmen in livery. I stopped in front. From the inner rooms came the sounds of loud conversation and laughter: the prince, in addition to the guest's chamber junker, had other visitors. I ordered the lackey to report about myself, and, it seems, in a slightly proud expression: at least, going to report, he looked at me strangely, it seemed to me, not even as respectfully as he should have. To my surprise, he reported something for a very long time, about five minutes, and meanwhile the same laughter and the same echoes of conversation were heard from there.","The next day at eleven sharp I presented myself at Prince V.'s Moscow bachelor apartment, which, as far as I could judge, was sumptuously furnished and staffed with lackeys in livery. I was asked to wait in the hall. While there, I could hear the sounds of laughter and loud voices coming from the drawing room. Obviously, Prince V. had other guests beside the young Versilov. I believe that when I ordered the footman to announce me I did it in a rather haughty way, and I got the impression that, upon leaving the room, he gave me a rather peculiar look. I thought it was not quite as respectful as it should have been. It seemed to take him an awfully long time to announce me, perhaps as much as five minutes, while the laughter and the conversation didn't seem to abate in the least.","Next day, exactly at eleven o'clock, I turned up at Prince V.'s flat, which, as I was able to judge, was splendidly furnished, though it was a bachelor's establishment. I was kept waiting in the hall where there were several lackeys in livery. And from the next room came sounds of loud talk and laughter : Prince V. had other visitors besides the kammer-junker. I told the footman to announce me, and, I fancy, in rather haughty terms. Anyway, he looked at me strangely, and, as I fancied, not so respectfully as he should have done. To my amazement he was a very long time in announcing me, five minutes, and all the while the same laughter, and the same sounds of conversation reached me."
"Я знал возражения и тотчас же объяснил ему, что это вовсе не так глупо, как он полагает. Во-первых, нахалу князю будет доказано, что есть еще люди, понимающие честь, и в нашем сословии, а во-вторых, будет пристыжен Версилов и вынесет урок. А в-третьих, и главное, если даже Версилов был и прав, по каким-нибудь там своим убеждениям, не вызвав князя и решившись снести пощечину, то по крайней мере он увидит, что есть существо, до того сильно способное чувствовать его обиду, что принимает ее как за свою, и готовое положить за интересы его даже жизнь свою… несмотря на то что с ним расстается навеки…","I knew the objections and immediately explained to him that this was not at all as stupid as he thought. Firstly, it will be proved to the impudent prince that there are still people who understand honor in our class, and secondly, Versilov will be ashamed and will learn a lesson. And thirdly, and most importantly, even if Versilov was right, according to some of his convictions, without calling the prince and deciding to take a slap in the face, then at least he will see that there is a creature so strongly capable of feeling his offense, that he accepts her as his own, and is ready to lay even his life for his interests ... despite the fact that he is parting with him forever ...","I'd anticipated his objections and explained to him that what I had in mind was not as stupid as might appear. In the first place, the arrogant prince would be taught a lesson that there were people who knew the meaning of honor in our class as well as in his; in the second place, Versilov would be put to shame and would learn his lesson too; and in the third place, even if Versilov had perfectly valid reasons—based on his convictions or some such thing—to bear the insult without challenging the prince to a duel, let him see that there was someone in the world who felt the offense to him keenly, who took it as a personal insult, and who was prepared to risk his fife to avenge it . . . even though he may have decided to part from Versilov for ever and ever.","I was prepared for the objection, and at once explained to him that it was not so stupid as he supposed. To begin with, the insolent prince would be shown that there are people, even in our class, who know what is meant by honour; and secondly, Versilov would be put to shame and learn a lesson. And in the third place, what mattered most of all, even if Versilov had been right in refusing to challenge him in accordance with his convictions at the time, he would see that there was some one who was capable of feeling the insult to him so keenly that he accepted it as an insult to himself, and was prepared to lay down his life for his, Versilov's, interests … although he was leaving him for ever… ."

Then he listened to more of Lambert's explanations with an air of distaste, apparently impatiently waiting to get out of there. It looked as though the whole incident were just a schoolboy prank. Trishatov took his cup of coffee, walked around the table, and sat down in Andreyev's place next to me.","""Very horrid,"" whispered the pock-marked man, looking really angry at last.

"Над тем самым, с тех пор, Максим Иванович и задумался. И переменился человек, что узнать нельзя. Больно уж тогда опечалился. Стал было пить, много пил, да бросил – не помогло. Бросил и на фабрику ездить, никого не слушает. Говорят ему что – молчит али рукой махнет. Так проходил он месяца с два, а потом стал сам с собой говорить. Ходит и сам с собой говорит. Сгорела подгородная деревнюшка Васькова, выгорело девять домов; поехал Максим Иванович взглянуть. Обступили его погорельцы, взвыли – обещал помочь и приказ отдал, а потом призвал управляющего и все отменил: «Не надоть, говорит, ничего давать» – и не сказал за что. «В попрание меня, говорит, отдал Господь всем людям, яко же некоего изверга, то уж пусть так и будет. Как ветер, говорит, развеялась слава моя». Приехал к нему сам архимандрит, старец был строгий и в монастыре общежитие ввел. «Ты чего?» – говорит, строго так. «А я вот чего», – и раскрыл ему Максим Иванович книгу и указал место:","Above this, since then, Maxim Ivanovich has been thinking. And the man has changed, that it is impossible to know. Painfully sad then. I began to drink, drank a lot, but quit - it did not help. He gave up going to the factory, he doesn't listen to anyone. They tell him that - he is silent, or he waves his hand. He went on like this for about two months, and then he began to talk to himself. He walks and talks to himself. The suburban village of Vaskov burned down, nine houses burned down; Maxim Ivanovich went to have a look. The fire victims surrounded him, howled - he promised to help and gave the order, and then he called the manager and canceled everything: “Don’t get tired, he says, give nothing” - and didn’t say why. “To trample me, he says, the Lord gave to all people, like a certain monster, then so be it. Like the wind, he says, my glory has scattered. The archimandrite himself came to see him, the elder was strict and introduced a hostel in the monastery. ""What are you?"" - says strictly so. “And this is what I am,” and Maxim Ivanovich opened the book to him and pointed out the place:","And it was just that that made Maxim brood ever after. It changed the man so you could no longer recognize him. He always looked dejected. At first, he tried to drink, drank an awful lot, but then gave it up. It didn't help. He stopped going to his mill, stopped listening to people. If someone spoke to him, he'd just wave the man away without answering. That went on for a month or two and then he started talking to himself. He'd walk around all alone talking out loud. Later there was a fire in the village of Voskova—that's downstream from the town—and nine houses burned down from top to bottom. Maxim drove over to have a look. Those who'd lost their houses gathered around him, wailing. He promised to help, even gave orders to that effect to his steward. But later he called the steward back. "" No,"" he told him, ""no need for me to give them anything."" He didn't explain why he'd changed his mind, although he added: ""God has sent me here so everyone can hate me like some kind of a monster, so let it be that way. My ill fame has been spread around as if by the wind."" The archimandrite came in person to have a talk with Maxim. He was a severe old man, strict with the monastery community. ""What are you up to now?"" the archimandrite asked Maxim sternly. ""Here's what I'm up to."" Maxim opened the Bible and pointed out a passage. It was Matthew 18:6, where it says: ""","And Maxim Ivanovitch brooded over it ever after. The man became so changed one would hardly have known him. He sorrowed grievously. He tried drinking, and drank heavily, but gave it up—it was no help. He gave up going to the factory too, he would listen to no one. If anyone spoke to him, he would be silent, or wave his hand. So he spent two months, and then he began talking to himself. He would walk about talking to himself. Vaskovo, the little village down the hill, caught fire, and nine houses were burnt; Maxim Ivanovitch drove up to look. The peasants whose cottages were burnt came round him wailing; he promised to help them and gave orders, and then he called his steward again and took it back. ""There's no need,"" said he, ""don't give them anything,"" and he never said why. ""God has sent me to be a scorn unto all men,"" said he, ""like some monster, and therefore so be it. Like the wind,"" said he, ""has my fame gone abroad. "" The archimandrite himself came to him. He was a stern man, the head of the community of the monastery. ""What are you doing?"" he asked sternly. ""I will tell you."" And Maxim Ivanovitch opened the Bible and pointed to the passage:"

"– Да, мальчик, повторю тебе, что я не могу не уважать моего дворянства.

Нас, может быть, всего только тысяча человек – может, более, может, менее, – но вся Россия жила лишь пока для того, чтобы произвести эту тысячу.

This type is purely Russian, but since it is still confined to the upper cultural layers of the Russian nation, I have the honor of belonging to it. There are, perhaps, at the present time no more than a thousand representatives of that type, well, give or take a few; but, so far, Russia has existed in order to produce that thousand men.

"– Кушать давно готово, – прибавила она, почти сконфузившись, – суп только бы не простыл, а котлетки я сейчас велю… – Она было стала поспешно вставать, чтоб идти на кухню, и в первый раз, может быть, в целый месяц мне вдруг стало стыдно, что она слишком уж проворно вскакивает для моих услуг, тогда как до сих пор сам же я того требовал.","“It’s been ready to eat for a long time,” she added, almost embarrassed, “if only the soup doesn’t get cold, and I’m ordering cutlets now ...” She began to hastily get up to go to the kitchen, and for the first time, maybe in a whole month, I suddenly I felt ashamed that she jumped up too quickly for my services, whereas up until now I myself had demanded it.","""Your dinner has been ready a long time. ...

"Прежде всего мне стала ужасно не нравиться комната Васина. «Покажи мне свою комнату, и я узнаю твой характер» – право, можно бы так сказать. Васин жил в меблированной комнате от жильцов, очевидно бедных и тем промышлявших, имевших постояльцев и кроме него. Знакомы мне эти узкие, чуть-чуть заставленные мебелью комнатки и, однако же, с претензией на комфортабельный вид; тут непременно мягкий диван с Толкучего рынка, который опасно двигать, рукомойник и ширмами огороженная железная кровать. Васин был, очевидно, лучшим и благонадежнейшим жильцом; такой самый лучший жилец непременно бывает один у хозяйки, и за это ему особенно угождают: у него убирают и подметают тщательнее, вешают над диваном какую-нибудь литографию, под стол подстилают чахоточный коврик. Люди, любящие эту затхлую чистоту, а главное, угодливую почтительность хозяек, – сами подозрительны. Я был убежден, что звание лучшего жильца льстило самому Васину. Не знаю почему, но меня начал мало-помалу бесить вид этих двух загроможденных книгами столов. Книги, бумаги, чернилица – все было в самом отвратительном порядке, идеал которого совпадает с мировоззрением хозяйки-немки и ее горничной. Книг было довольно, и не то что газет и журналов, а настоящих книг, – и он, очевидно, их читал и, вероятно, садился читать или принимался писать с чрезвычайно важным и аккуратным видом. Не знаю, но я больше люблю, где книги разбросаны в беспорядке, по крайней мере из занятий не делается священнодействия. Наверно, этот Васин чрезвычайно вежлив с посетителем, но, наверно, каждый жест его говорит посетителю: «Вот я посижу с тобою часика полтора, а потом, когда ты уйдешь, займусь уже делом». Наверно, с ним можно завести чрезвычайно интересный разговор и услышать новое, но – «мы вот теперь с тобою поговорим, и я тебя очень заинтересую, а когда ты уйдешь, я примусь уже за самое интересное»… И однако же, я все-таки не уходил, а сидел. В том же, что совсем не нуждаюсь в его совете, я уже окончательно убедился.","First of all, I began to dislike Vassin's room terribly. ""Show me your room, and I will know your character"" - right, one could say so. Vasin lived in a furnished room from tenants, obviously poor and those who hunted, who had lodgers besides him. I am familiar with these narrow rooms, slightly crowded with furniture and, however, with a claim to a comfortable view; there is certainly a soft sofa from the Market Market, which is dangerous to move, a washstand and an iron bed enclosed by screens. Vassin was obviously the best and most trustworthy lodger; such the best tenant is sure to be alone with the hostess, and for this he is especially pleased: they clean and sweep carefully, hang some kind of lithograph over the sofa, spread a consumptive rug under the table. People who love this musty cleanliness, and most importantly, the obsequious respectfulness of hostesses, are themselves suspicious. I was convinced that the title of the best lodger flattered Vassin himself. I don't know why, but little by little the sight of these two tables cluttered with books began to infuriate me. Books, papers, ink - everything was in the most disgusting order, the ideal of which coincides with the worldview of the German hostess and her maid. There were enough books, and not only newspapers and magazines, but real books - and he obviously read them and probably sat down to read or began to write with an extremely important and neat air. I don’t know, but I prefer where the books are scattered in disorder, at least the sacred rites are not made from classes. Probably, this Vasin is extremely polite with the visitor, but, probably, every gesture of his says to the visitor: ""Here I will sit with you for an hour and a half, and then, when you leave, I will get down to business."" You can probably start an extremely interesting conversation with him and hear something new, but - “we’ll talk with you now, and I’ll interest you very much, and when you leave, I’ll get down to the most interesting” ... And yet, I still did not leave, but sat. The fact that I do not need his advice at all, I have already finally convinced myself.","In the first place, I found Vasin's room more and more irritating. There is truth in the statement ""Show me your room and I'll tell you what sort of man you are. "" Vasin rented a furnished room in an apartment. His landlady must have been hard up and only managed to make both ends meet by taking in lodgers, for there were obviously other lodgers besides Vasin. I was well acquainted with this sort of room—poky and poorly furnished yet with pretensions to comfort: there was the ever-present soft sofa fresh from the flea market that was dangerous to move lest it collapse; there was a screen and behind it a washstand and an iron bed. I suppose Vasin was the best and the most dependable lodger in the apartment. All landladies have a favorite lodger whom they treat with special consideration: they clean his room with greater care, sweep his floor more thoroughly, hang lithographs over his sofa, and lay a mangy-looking rug under his table. I never trust people who like that sort of musty tidiness and especially the servile deference of their landladies. I'm convinced that Vasin was flattered by his position of favorite lodger. I don't know why, but the sight of books piled high on two tables infuriated me particularly. The books, the papers, the inkpot—everything was arranged with that oppressive and revolting orderliness that fitted in with the ideas about the world shared by the landlady and the cleaning woman. There were lots of books around—not just magazines and periodicals but real books—and I imagined the ponderous, precise, and pompous air Vasin must affect when he sat down to do his methodical reading or writing. I can't quite explain why, but I prefer books messily strewn around; I suppose that at least shows that work is not performed as some kind of sacred ritual. I'm sure Vasin is always courteous with people who come to see him, but his expression and every gesture remind the visitor "" All right, I'll give you an hour and a half of my time and when you leave I'll go back to my work. "" I guess one can have a very interesting conversation with him and learn something new but, behind it, the visitor must always be aware of Vasin thinking: ""All right, I'll talk to you and tell you very interesting things, but only after you've gone will I get down to serious business. . . ."" Nevertheless I sat and waited. And this seemed to make even less sense since I was now quite convinced that I had no need of his advice.","First of all, I began to feel an intense dislike for Vassin's room. ""Show me your room and I will tell you your character,"" one really may say that. Vassin had a furnished room in a flat belonging to people evidently poor, who let lodgings for their living and had other lodgers besides Vassin. I was familiar with poky apartments of this sort, scarcely furnished, yet with pretensions to comfort: there is invariably a soft sofa from the second-hand market, which is dangerous to move; a washing-stand and an iron bed shut off by a screen. Vassin was evidently the best and the most to be depended on of the lodgers. Lodging-house keepers always have one such best lodger, and particularly try to please him. They sweep and tidy his room more carefully, and hang lithographs over his sofa; under the table they lay an emaciated-looking rug. People who are fond of stuffy tidiness and, still more, of obsequious deference in their landladies are to be suspected. I felt convinced that Vassin himself was flattered by his position as best lodger. I don't know why, but the sight of those two tables piled up with books gradually enraged me. The books, the papers, the inkstand, all were arrayed with a revolting tidiness, the ideal of which would have coincided with the loftiest conceptions of a German landlady and her maidservant. There were a good many books, not merely magazines and reviews, but real books, and he evidently read them, and he probably sat down to read or to write with an extremely important and precise expression. I don't know why, but I prefer to see books lying about in disorder. Then, at any rate, work is not made into a sacred rite. No doubt Vassin was extremely polite to his visitors, but probably every gesture he made told them plainly, ""I will spend an hour and a half with you, and afterwards, when you go away, I'll set to work. "" No doubt one might have a very interesting conversation with him and hear something new from him, but he would be thinking, ""Here we are talking now, and I am interesting you very much, but when you go away, I shall proceed to something more interesting… . "" Yet I did not go away, but went on sitting there. That I had absolutely no need of his advice I was by now thoroughly convinced."
"– Да перестань уж ты, Александр Семенович, полно браниться, – рассмеялся Макар Иванович. – Ну что, батюшка, Андрей Петрович, как с нашей барышней поступили? Вот она целое утро клокчет, беспокоится, – прибавил он, показывая на маму.","“Come on, Alexander Semyonovich, stop scolding a lot,” Makar Ivanovich laughed. - Well, father, Andrey Petrovich, how did they treat our young lady? She's been chirping all morning, worrying,"" he added, pointing to his mother.","""Ah, stop complaining, Doc,"" Makar said, laughing, and then, turning to Versilov, asked him: ""You tell me, sir, what they've decided to do about our Mrs. Prutkov? This lady here""—he pointed at Mother— ""has been going around sighing and moaning and worrying about it all morning. . . .""","""Come give over, Alexandr Semyonovitch, that's enough scolding,"" said Makar Ivanovitch laughing.

"Но я не мог докончить, во-первых, потому, что разгорячился и растерялся. Мать вся побледнела, и как будто голос ее пресекся: не могла выговорить ни слова. Татьяна Павловна говорила что-то очень громко и много, так что я даже разобрать не мог, и раза два пихнула меня в плечо кулаком. Я только запомнил, что она прокричала, что мои слова «напускные, в мелкой душе взлелеянные, пальцем вывороченные». Версилов сидел неподвижно и очень серьезный, не улыбался. Я пошел к себе наверх. Последний взгляд, проводивший меня из комнаты, был укорительный взгляд сестры; она строго качала мне вслед головой.","But I could not finish, firstly, because I got excited and confused. Mother turned pale all over, and it was as if her voice had stopped: she could not utter a word. Tatyana Pavlovna was saying something very loudly and a lot, so that I could not even make it out, and once or twice she punched me in the shoulder with her fist. I only remember that she shouted that my words were ""sham, cherished in a petty soul, twisted with a finger."" Versilov sat motionless and very serious, not smiling. I went upstairs. The last look that saw me out of the room was the reproachful look of my sister; she shook her head sternly at me.","I couldn't go on. I was too agitated and lost the thread of my thought. My mother's face was ashen. Her lips were moving, but no sound came out of her mouth. It was as if I'd cut off her voice. Mrs. Prutkov was saying something so quickly and loudly that I couldn't even make out what it was, and twice she actually shoved me. I only registered her saying that it was all ""sham,"" ""the outpourings of a despicable mind,"" moreover ""deliberately twisted and turned inside out."" Versilov sat without stirring. The smile had gone from his lips and his face was grave. I got up and went upstairs to my attic. The last thing I saw was my sister's reproachful glance. She also shook her head in disapproval.","But I could not go on, partly because I was excited and confused. My mother turned pale and her voice seemed to fail her: she could not utter a word. Tatyana Pavlovna said something in a very loud voice and at great length which I could not make out, and twice she pushed me on the shoulder with her fist. I only remember that she shouted that ""my words were a sham, the broodings of a petty soul, counted over and turned inside out. "" Versilov sat motionless and very serious, he was not smiling. I went upstairs to my room. The last thing I saw as I went out was the reproach in my sister's eyes; she shook her head at me sternly."

"Но объяснить, кого я встретил, так, заранее, когда никто ничего не знает, будет пошло; даже, я думаю, и тон этот пошл: дав себе слово уклоняться от литературных красот, я с первой строки впадаю в эти красоты. Кроме того, чтобы писать толково, кажется, мало одного желания. Замечу тоже, что, кажется, ни на одном европейском языке не пишется так трудно, как на русском. Я перечел теперь то, что сейчас написал, и вижу, что я гораздо умнее написанного. Как это так выходит, что у человека умного высказанное им гораздо глупее того, что в нем остается? Я это не раз замечал за собой и в моих словесных отношениях с людьми за весь этот последний роковой год и много мучился этим.","But to explain who I met in such a way, in advance, when no one knows anything, would be vulgar; even, I think, this tone is vulgar: having given myself the word to avoid literary beauties, from the first line I fall into these beauties. In addition, it seems that desire alone is not enough to write sensibly. I also note that, it seems, it is not so difficult to write in any European language as in Russian. I have now re-read what I have just written, and I see that I am much smarter than what I have written. How does it come about that what an intelligent person says is much more stupid than what remains in him? I noticed this more than once in myself and in my verbal relations with people during this last fateful year and suffered a lot from this.","But it would be too cheap and conventional a literary device to say who it was I met without explaining anything beforehand. Indeed, I believe it would be in poor taste. Having promised myself to avoid literary devices, here I am falling for one in the very first sentence. But just wanting to write sensibly is not enough to enable a man to do so. Let me add that, in my opinion, writing in Russian is more difficult than in any other European language. I've just reread my opening lines and I can safely say that I'm much more intelligent than what I wrote. Why is it, then, that what an intelligent man manages to express is much more stupid than what remains in him unexpressed? I've also noticed this discrepancy in my verbal communication with people many times throughout this fatal year and it has worried me a great deal.","I have passed the leaving examination at the grammar school, and now I am in my twenty-first year."

"Когда я вошел, часов в одиннадцать утра, то застал Версилова уже доканчивавшего какую-то длинную тираду; князь слушал, шагая по комнате, а Версилов сидел. Князь казался в некотором волнении. Версилов почти всегда мог приводить его в волнение. Князь был чрезвычайно восприимчивое существо, до наивности, заставлявшей меня во многих случаях смотреть на него свысока. Но, повторяю, в последние дни в нем явилось что-то злобно оскаливающееся. Он приостановился, увидя меня, и как бы что-то передернулось в его лице. Я знал про себя, чем объяснить эту тень неудовольствия в это утро, но не ожидал, что до такой степени передернется лицо его. Мне известно было, что у него накопились разные беспокойства, но гадко было то, что я знал лишь десятую долю их – остальное было для меня тогда крепким секретом. Потому это было гадко и глупо, что я часто лез утешать его, давать советы и даже свысока усмехался над слабостью его выходить из себя «из-за таких пустяков». Он отмалчивался; но невозможно, чтоб не ненавидел меня в те минуты ужасно: я был в слишком фальшивом положении и даже не подозревал того. О, свидетельствуюсь Богом, что главного не подозревал!","When I entered, at about eleven o'clock in the morning, I found Versilov already finishing some long tirade; the prince listened as he paced the room, while Versilov sat. The prince seemed somewhat agitated. Versilov could almost always get him excited. The prince was an extremely receptive being, to the point of naivete, which on many occasions made me look down on him. But, I repeat, in the last days something maliciously grinning appeared in him. He paused when he saw me, and something seemed to twitch in his face. I knew to myself how to explain this shadow of displeasure this morning, but I did not expect that his face would wince to such an extent. I knew that he had accumulated various anxieties, but it was disgusting that I knew only a tenth of them - the rest was then a strong secret for me. Because it was disgusting and stupid that I often tried to console him, give advice, and even sneered down at his weakness to lose his temper ""over such trifles."" He remained silent; but it is impossible that he did not hate me terribly in those moments: I was in a very false position and did not even suspect it. Oh, I testify to God that I did not suspect the main thing!","So I got to Sergei's at about eleven that morning and found Versilov there, finishing what appeared to be a long discourse. Sergei was listening, pacing the room. Versilov sat in an armchair. The prince appeared somewhat agitated, but then Versilov could throw him into that state at will. Sergei's sensitivity verged on simplicity, which caused me to be rather condescending toward him. But, as I said, lately I'd detected in him something that might be described as an inner spiteful snarl. He stopped short when he saw me and his face twitched. I knew that there were things that were bothering him, but what is awful is that I imagined only about a tenth of what was really weighing on him and never even suspected the existence of the remaining nine-tenths. Yes, it was stupid and awful because I often took it upon myself to reassure him, offer him advice, and I'd even smile condescendingly at his propensity to lose his temper over what I called ""such trifles""! He said nothing, but I can imagine how he must have hated me at those moments. I never even suspected in what a false position I was; I swear to God I had no inkling of what mattered to him most!","When I went in at eleven o'clock in the morning I found Versilov just finishing a long tirade. Prince Sergay was walking about the room listening, and Versilov was sitting down. Prince Sergay seemed in some excitement. Versilov was almost always able to work him into a state of excitement. He was exceedingly impressionable, to a degree of simplicity, indeed, which had often made me look down on him. But, I repeat, of late I had detected in him something like a resentful sneer. He stopped short, seeing me, and a quiver seemed to pass over his face. I knew in my heart to what to attribute the shadow over him that morning, but I had not expected that his face would be so distorted by it. I knew that he had an accumulation of anxieties, but it was revolting that I didn't know more than a tenth part of them —the rest had been kept so far a dead secret from me. What made it stupid and revolting was that I often obtruded my sympathy on him, gave advice and often laughed condescendingly at his weakness at being so upset ""about such trifles."" He used to be silent; but he must have detested me at those moments; I was in an utterly false position and had no suspicion of it. Oh, I call God to witness that of the chief trouble I had no suspicion!"

Fearing, he put off a minute. Why not assume in me, instead of laziness or deceit, something more innocent, well, at least stupid, but more noble.

Que diable, I'm stupid often enough without being high-minded! What use would you be to me if you already had propensities for ruthlessness? Trying to argue with you, to change you, if you'd been like that, would have been cheap, and, besides, you'd have lost all value in my eyes even if I had managed to set you straight.""","""Again, it's a question of conscience,"" he said with a smile.

To persuade and try to reform in that case would be degrading; you would have lost every sort of value in my eyes even if you were reformed… ."""
"На четвертый день моего сознания я лежал, в третьем часу пополудни, на моей постели, и никого со мной не было. День был ясный, и я знал, что в четвертом часу, когда солнце будет закатываться, то косой красный луч его ударит прямо в угол моей стены и ярким пятном осветит это место. Я знал это по прежним дням, и то, что это непременно сбудется через час, а главное то, что я знал об этом вперед, как дважды два, разозлило меня до злобы. Я судорожно повернулся всем телом и вдруг, среди глубокой тишины, ясно услышал слова: «Господи, Иисусе Христе, Боже наш, помилуй нас». Слова произнеслись полушепотом, за ними следовал глубокий вздох всею грудью, и затем все опять совершенно стихло.

I knew this from the old days, and the fact that it would certainly come true in an hour, and most importantly, that I knew about it in advance, like twice two, angered me to the point of anger. I turned around convulsively with my whole body and suddenly, in the midst of deep silence, I clearly heard the words: “Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us.” The words were uttered in a half-whisper, followed by a deep sigh from the whole chest, and then everything was completely silent again.

I knew it because that was just what had happened on previous days, and the fact that it would happen without fail within the next hour—that I was as sure of it as I was that two times two is four—irritated me to the point of fury.

"Я хочу только сказать, что никогда не мог узнать и удовлетворительно догадаться, с чего именно началось у него с моей матерью. Я вполне готов верить, как уверял он меня прошлого года сам, с краской в лице, несмотря на то, что рассказывал про все это с самым непринужденным и «остроумным» видом, что романа никакого не было вовсе и что все вышло так. Верю, что так, и русское словцо это: так– прелестно; но все-таки мне всегда хотелось узнать, с чего именно у них могло произойти. Сам я ненавидел и ненавижу все эти мерзости всю мою жизнь. Конечно, тут вовсе не одно только бесстыжее любопытство с моей стороны. Замечу, что мою мать я, вплоть до прошлого года, почти не знал вовсе; с детства меня отдали в люди, для комфорта Версилова, об чем, впрочем, после; а потому я никак не могу представить себе, какое у нее могло быть в то время лицо. Если она вовсе не была так хороша собой, то чем мог в ней прельститься такой человек, как тогдашний Версилов? Вопрос этот важен для меня тем, что в нем чрезвычайно любопытною стороною рисуется этот человек. Вот для чего я спрашиваю, а не из разврата. Он сам, этот мрачный и закрытый человек, с тем милым простодушием, которое он черт знает откуда брал (точно из кармана), когда видел, что это необходимо, – он сам говорил мне, что тогда он был весьма «глупым молодым щенком» и не то что сентиментальным, а так, только что прочел «Антона Горемыку» и «Полиньку Сакс» – две литературные вещи, имевшие необъятное цивилизующее влияние на тогдашнее подрастающее поколение наше. Он прибавлял, что из-за «Антона Горемыки», может, и в деревню тогда приехал, – и прибавлял чрезвычайно серьезно. В какой же форме мог начать этот «глупый щенок» с моей матерью? Я сейчас вообразил, что если б у меня был хоть один читатель, то наверно бы расхохотался надо мной, как над смешнейшим подростком, который, сохранив свою глупую невинность, суется рассуждать и решать, в чем не смыслит. Да, действительно, я еще не смыслю, хотя сознаюсь в этом вовсе не из гордости, потому что знаю, до какой степени глупа в двадцатилетнем верзиле такая неопытность; только я скажу этому господину, что он сам не смыслит, и докажу ему это. Правда, в женщинах я ничего не знаю, да и знать не хочу, потому что всю жизнь буду плевать и дал слово. Но я знаю, однако же, наверно, что иная женщина обольщает красотой своей, или там чем знает, в тот же миг; другую же надо полгода разжевывать, прежде чем понять, что в ней есть; и чтобы рассмотреть такую и влюбиться, то мало смотреть и мало быть просто готовым на что угодно, а надо быть, сверх того, чем-то еще одаренным. В этом я убежден, несмотря на то что ничего не знаю, и если бы было противное, то надо бы было разом низвести всех женщин на степень простых домашних животных и в таком только виде держать их при себе; может быть, этого очень многим хотелось бы.","I only want to say that I have never been able to find out and guess satisfactorily what exactly started between him and my mother. I am quite ready to believe, as he himself assured me last year, with a blush in his face, despite the fact that he told about all this with the most casual and ""witty"" look, that there was no romance at all and that everything turned out like this. I believe that it is so, and the Russian word is: so - charming; but all the same, I always wanted to know what exactly could have happened to them. I myself have hated and hate all these abominations all my life. Of course, this is not just shameless curiosity on my part. I note that until last year I hardly knew my mother at all; from childhood I was given to the people, for the comfort of Versilov, about which, however, later; wherefore, I can never imagine what kind of face she might have had at that time. If she was not at all so pretty, then how could such a person as the then Versilov be seduced in her? This question is important to me because it depicts this person in an extremely curious way. That's why I'm asking, not out of depravity. He himself, this gloomy and closed person, with that sweet innocence that he took from God knows where (as if from his pocket) when he saw that it was necessary - he himself told me that then he was a very ""stupid young puppy"" and not only sentimental, but just like that, I just read “Anton Goremyka” and “Polinka Saks” - two literary works that had an immense civilizing influence on our then younger generation. He added that because of ""Anton Goremyka"" he might have come to the village then - and he added extremely seriously. In what form could this “stupid puppy” start with my mother? I now imagined that if I had at least one reader, they would probably laugh at me, as at the funniest teenager who, retaining his stupid innocence, pokes his head to reason and decide what he does not understand. Yes, indeed, I still do not understand, although I confess this not at all out of pride, because I know how stupid such inexperience is in a twenty-year-old big man; only I will tell this gentleman that he himself does not understand, and I will prove it to him. True, I don’t know anything about women, and I don’t want to know, because I’ll spit all my life and I gave my word. But I know, however, for sure, that some woman seduces with her beauty, or knows what, at the same moment; the other must be chewed for half a year before you understand what is in it; and in order to consider such and fall in love, it is not enough to look and it is not enough to be simply ready for anything, but one must be, moreover, something else gifted. I am convinced of this, despite the fact that I know nothing, and if it were the opposite, then it would be necessary to immediately reduce all women to the level of simple domestic animals and keep them with me in this form only; maybe a lot of people would like that.","I must say I could never find out, or even think up, a plausible explanation of how he got involved with my mother in the first place. I am fully prepared to believe, as he assured me himself last year (his face rather red but his tone casual and if anything amused), that there certainly was no romance and that it happened ""just like that. "" I believe that and I find the expression ""just like that"" delightful. Nevertheless, I still would like to know exactly what could have started it off between them. I myself have always loathed and still loathe to this day all that filth, so obviously this is not just shameless curiosity on my part. Let me note here that I hardly knew my mother until a year ago. While still a small child I'd been packed off to live with strangers so as not to disturb Versilov's peace (I'll have more to say about that later), so I can't imagine what she looked like at that time. If she wasn't particularly beautiful, it remains quite inexplicable why a man such as Versilov was then should have been attracted to her. This matter is so important to me because it could shed some light on an aspect of his character that intrigues me a great deal. And that's why I'm trying to find the answer, not out of depravity. That mysterious and distant man told me himself once—with that disarming charm of his which he could produce out of God knows where when he thought he needed it—that he was ""just a stupid young dog"" then who, although not particularly sentimental, happened to have just read Poor Anton[9] and Polinka Sachs,[10] two literary works which he considered had exerted an overwhelming humanizing influence on the young generation of his day. And he added, with an air of utmost gravity, that it was perhaps under the impact of Poor Anton that he had gone to his country estate in the first place. But I still wonder how the ""stupid young dog"" approached my mother. . . . The thought has suddenly struck me that if anyone ever read what I've written here, he would burst out laughing at this ridiculous adolescent who, in his silly innocence, has the presumption to discuss and analyze things of which he knows nothing. Well, indeed, I know nothing about these things, and I'm not proud to admit it because I realize that this sort of innocence may look stupid in a nineteen-year-old oaf. But I'd also like to tell that reader that he knows nothing either, and I'll prove it to him. It's true I don't know the first thing about women, but then I don't want to know anything about them. I've decided—the hell with them, and I've sworn to myself that I'll never change on that point. Nevertheless, I am very well aware that there are women who can, within one second, sweep you off your feet by their beauty or charm, while with others it may take you as long as six months just to make them out and understand what's in them; to decipher a woman like that and fall in love with her, it's not enough just to look at her and be ready for whatever may come; no, a man must have a special gift for that. And although, as I've said before, I know nothing, I'm convinced of what I just said because if this isn't so, then all women should be immediately reduced to the status of domestic animals and should be kept around only as such; I'm sure many men would like that very much.","I only want to say that I have never been able to find out or to guess to my own satisfaction what led up to everything between him and my mother. I am quite ready to believe, as he himself assured me last year with a flushed face, though he talked of all this with the most unconstrained and flippant air, that there was no romance about it at all, that it had just happened. I believe that it did just happen, and that little phrase JUST HAPPENED is delightful, yet I always wanted to know how it could have come about. I have always hated that sort of nastiness all my life and always shall. It's not simply a disgraceful curiosity on my part, of course. I may remark that I knew absolutely nothing of my mother till a year ago. For the sake of Versilov's comfort I was sent away to strangers, but of that later, and so I can never picture what she looked like at that time. If she had not been at all pretty, what could a man such as Versilov was then have found attractive in her? This question is of importance to me because it throws a light on an extremely interesting side of that man's character. It is for that reason I ask it and not from depravity. Gloomy and reserved as he always was, he told me himself on one occasion, with that charming candour which he used to produce (from the devil knows where—it seemed to come out of his pocket when he saw it was indispensable) that at that time he was a ""very silly young puppy""; not that he was exactly sentimental, but just that he had lately read ""Poor Anton"" and ""Polinka Sachs,"" two literary works which exerted an immense, humanizing influence on the younger generation of that day. He added that it was perhaps through ""Poor Anton"" that he went to the country, and he added it with the utmost gravity. How did that ""silly puppy"" begin at first with my mother? I have suddenly realized that if I had a single reader he would certainly be laughing at me as a most ridiculous raw youth, still stupidly innocent, putting himself forward to discuss and criticize what he knows nothing about. It is true that I know nothing about it, though I recognize that not at all with pride, for I know how stupid such inexperience is in a great dolt of twenty; only I would tell such a gentleman that he knows nothing about it himself, and I will prove it to him. It is true that I know nothing about women, and I don't want to either, for I shall always despise that sort of thing, and I have sworn I will all my life. But I know for certain, though, that some women fascinate by their beauty, or by anything you like, all in a minute, while you may ruminate over another for six months before you understand what is in her; and that to see through and love such a woman it is not enough to look at her, it is not enough to be simply ready for anything, one must have a special gift besides. Of that I am convinced, although I do know nothing about it: and if it were not true it would mean degrading all women to the level of domestic animals, and only keeping them about one as such; possibly this is what very many people would like."

"Наконец, чтобы перейти к девятнадцатому числу окончательно, скажу пока вкратце и, так сказать, мимолетом, что я застал их всех, то есть Версилова, мать и сестру мою (последнюю я увидал в первый раз в жизни), при тяжелых обстоятельствах, почти в нищете или накануне нищеты. Об этом я узнал уж и в Москве, но все же не предполагал того, что увидел. Я с самого детства привык воображать себе этого человека, этого «будущего отца моего» почти в каком-то сиянии и не мог представить себе иначе, как на первом месте везде. Никогда Версилов не жил с моею матерью на одной квартире, а всегда нанимал ей особенную: конечно, делал это из подлейших ихних «приличий». Но тут все жили вместе, в одном деревянном флигеле, в переулке, в Семеновском полку. Все вещи уже были заложены, так что я даже отдал матери, таинственно от Версилова, мои таинственные шестьдесят рублей. Именно таинственные потому, что были накоплены из карманных денег моих, которых отпускалось мне по пяти рублей в месяц, в продолжение двух лет; копление же началось с первого дня моей «идеи», а потому Версилов не должен был знать об этих деньгах ни слова. Этого я трепетал.","Finally, in order to pass to the nineteenth number definitively, I will say briefly for now and, so to speak, in passing, that I found them all, that is, Versilov, my mother and sister (the latter I saw for the first time in my life), under difficult circumstances, almost in poverty or on the eve of poverty. I learned about this already in Moscow, but still I did not imagine what I saw. Ever since childhood, I have been accustomed to imagine this man, this ""future father of mine"" in almost some kind of radiance and could not imagine otherwise than in the first place everywhere. Versilov never lived with my mother in the same apartment, but always rented a special one for her: of course, he did it out of their meanest ""decencies."" But here everyone lived together, in the same wooden outbuilding, in an alley, in the Semyonovsky regiment. All the things had already been pawned, so that I even gave my mother, mysteriously from Versilov, my mysterious sixty rubles. Precisely mysterious because they were accumulated from my pocket money, which was given to me at five rubles a month for two years; but accumulation began from the first day of my ""idea,"" and therefore Versilov must not have known a word about this money. This I trembled.","Now, at last, I can get to September 19. First, let me just say in passing, as it were, that I found them all—Versilov, my mother, and my sister, whom I was seeing for the first time in my life—living in very difficult circumstances, almost destitute or on the verge of destitution. I'd found out about their situation while I was still in Moscow, but I never expected things to be that bad. Since I was a child, I had got used to imagining this man, ""who would some day be my father,"" as all but radiating his own light, and I could not conceive of him except as always occupying the top position. As a rule, Versilov never lived with my mother; he always had his own apartment in order to observe their despicable ""proprieties."" But now they were all living together in a little wooden cottage in a side street behind the barracks of the Semyonovsky Regiment. They had already pawned everything they could, so without Versilov's knowledge I gave my mother the sixty rubles I secretly owned. I said I owned it secretly because I had saved it in the course of two years from my allowance of five rubles a month. I had started saving the very day I conceived my ""idea,"" and that's why it was important that Versilov not know about the money. The mere thought that he might find out about it made me shudder.","Finally, to pass once for all to the 19th of September, I will observe briefly and, so to say, cursorily, that I found them all, that is Versilov, my mother and my sister (the latter I saw for the first time in my life) in difficult circumstances, almost destitute, or at least, on the verge of destitution. I knew of this before leaving Moscow, but yet I was not prepared for what I saw. I had been accustomed from childhood to imagine this man, this ""future father of mine"" in brilliant surroundings, and could not picture him except as the leading figure everywhere. Versilov had never shared the same lodgings with my mother, but had always taken rooms for her apart. He did this, of course, out of regard for their very contemptible ""proprieties."" But here they were all living together in a little wooden lodge in a back street in the Semyonovsky Polk. All their things were in pawn, so that, without Versilov's knowledge, I gave my mother my secret sixty roubles. SECRET, because I had saved them up in the course of two years out of my pocket money, which was five roubles a month. I had begun saving from the very day I had conceived my ""idea,"" and so Versilov must know nothing about the money. I trembled at the thought of that."

"Я упомянул уже о ее сношениях с Васиным. Она пошла к нему не потому лишь, чтоб показать нам, что в нас не нуждается, а и потому, что действительно ценила Васина. Знакомство их началось еще с Луги, и мне всегда казалось, что Васин был к ней неравнодушен. В несчастии, ее поразившем, она естественно могла пожелать совета от ума твердого, спокойного, всегда возвышенного, который предполагала в Васине. К тому же женщины небольшие мастерицы в оценке мужских умов, если человек им нравится, и парадоксы с удовольствием принимают за строгие выводы, если те согласны с их собственными желаниями. В Васине Лиза любила симпатию к своему положению и, как показалось ей с первых разов, симпатию и к князю. Подозревая притом его чувства к себе, она не могла не оценить в нем симпатии к его сопернику. Князь же, которому она сама передала, что ходит иногда советоваться к Васину, принял это известие с чрезвычайным беспокойством с самого первого раза; он стал ревновать ее. Лиза была этим оскорблена, так что нарочно уже продолжала сношения с Васиным. Князь примолк, но был мрачен. Лиза же сама мне потом призналась (очень долго спустя), что Васин даже очень скоро перестал ей тогда нравиться; он был спокоен, и именно это-то вечное ровное спокойствие, столь понравившееся ей вначале, показалось ей потом довольно неприглядным. Казалось бы, он был деловит и действительно дал ей несколько хороших с виду советов, но все эти советы, как нарочно, оказались неисполнимыми. Судил же иногда слишком свысока и нисколько перед нею не конфузясь, – не конфузясь, чем дальше, тем больше, – что и приписала она возраставшему и невольному его пренебрежению к ее положению. Раз она поблагодарила его за то, что он постоянно ко мне благодушен и, будучи так выше меня по уму, разговаривает со мной как с ровней (то есть передала ему мои же слова). Он ей ответил:","I have already mentioned her relations with Vassin. She went to him not only to show us that she did not need us, but also because she really appreciated Vassin. Their acquaintance began with Luga, and it always seemed to me that Vassin was not indifferent to her. In the misfortune that struck her, she could naturally wish for advice from a firm, calm, always sublime mind, which she assumed in Vassin. Besides, women are not good at judging men's minds if they like a man, and take paradoxes with pleasure for strict conclusions if they agree with their own desires. In Vassin, Lisa loved sympathy for her position and, as it seemed to her from the first time, sympathy for the prince. Suspecting, moreover, his feelings for herself, she could not help but appreciate in him sympathy for his rival. The prince, to whom she herself told that she sometimes goes to Vassin for advice, received this news with extreme anxiety from the very first time; he became jealous of her. Liza was offended by this, so that on purpose she already continued her relations with Vassin. The prince fell silent, but was gloomy. Liza herself confessed to me later (a very long time later) that she even very soon ceased to like Vassin then; he was calm, and it was this eternal even calmness, which she liked so much at first, which later seemed to her rather unattractive. It would seem that he was businesslike and really gave her some good-looking advice, but all these tips, as if on purpose, turned out to be unrealistic. He sometimes judged too haughtily and was not at all embarrassed before her - not embarrassed, the further, the more - which she attributed to his growing and involuntary disdain for her position. Once she thanked him for the fact that he is constantly complacent towards me and, being so superior to me in mind, talks to me as an equal (that is, she conveyed my own words to him). He answered her:","I've already mentioned her relations with Vasin. She'd gone to him for advice, not just to show us that she could do without our help but also because she really had a high regard for him. They had known each other ever since Luga, and I was under the impression that Vasin was not indifferent to her. So, in her misfortune, it was natural that she should seek advice from an exceptionally intelligent man, always calm and high-minded, as she considered Vasin to be. Besides, women are never too good at evaluating correctly a man's intelligence: if they like him, they're only too eager to accept even his paradoxes for well-reasoned conclusions as long as they coincide with their own wishes. What Lisa actually liked in Vasin was his sympathy for her situation and also what she assumed to be his sympathy for Sergei in his predicament. Guessing how Vasin felt about her, she appreciated all the more his concern for a rival. But when she told Sergei that she sometimes went to discuss things with Vasin, he became very worried and soon very jealous too. That offended Lisa and, if only for this reason, she continued seeing Vasin. Sergei didn't bring up the subject again but looked gloomy whenever she came. Much later, Lisa told me herself that around that time her liking for Vasin diminished and that his calm detachment, which had impressed her so much at first, now struck her as rather unpleasant. It is a fact that he appeared to have a cool and practical head and had given her some advice that seemed sound enough, but when she had tried to act upon it, she'd found it quite unworkable. Also, he offered his opinions rather condescendingly, a condescension that increased as time went by until it became quite obvious. She interpreted it as his instinctive scorn for her in her present situation. Thus, when she once told him how much she appreciated his kindness toward me and his willingness to talk to me as an equal when he was by far my intellectual superior (that is, she repeated to him just what I'd said to her), his answer took her aback:","I have already mentioned the terms she was on with Vassin. She went to see him not simply to show us that she did not need us, but because she really had a high opinion of him. Their acquaintance had begun at Luga, and I always fancied that Vassin was not indifferent to her, in the misfortunes that had overwhelmed her she might naturally have wished for the advice of a calm, resolute, always lofty mind such as she supposed Vassin's to be. Besides, women are not very clever in appreciating a man's mind at its true value when they like a man; and they will gladly accept paradoxes as the closest reasoning, if they fall in with their own desires. What Liza liked in Vassin was his sympathy for her in her position and, as she had fancied at first, his sympathy with Prince Sergay. When, later on, she suspected his feeling for her, she could not help appreciating the sympathy he showed for his rival. When she told Prince Sergay that she sometimes went to consult Vassin, he had from the first shown the greatest uneasiness; he began to be jealous. Liza was offended at this, and purposely maintained her friendly relations with Vassin. Prince Sergay said nothing, but was gloomy. Liza confessed to me (long afterwards) that Vassin had very soon ceased to attract her; he was composed, and just this everlasting unruffled composure, which had so attracted her at first, afterwards seemed to her distasteful. One would have thought he was practical, and he did, in fact, give her some apparently good advice, but all his advice, as ill-luck would have it, appeared later on impossible to carry out. He gave his opinions sometimes too conceitedly, and showed no trace of diffidence with her, becoming more and more free in his manner as time went on, which she ascribed to his unconsciously feeling less and less respect for her position. Once she thanked him for his invariable goodwill to me, and for talking to me as an intellectual equal though he was so superior to me (she was repeating my words). He answered:"

"Я шел из такого соображения: у меня сто рублей. В Петербурге же столько аукционов, распродаж, мелких лавочек на Толкучем и нуждающихся людей, что невозможно, купив вещь за столько-то, не продать ее несколько дороже. За альбом я взял семь рублей девяносто пять копеек барыша на два рубля пять копеек затраченного капитала. Этот огромный барыш взят был без риску: я по глазам видел, что покупщик не отступится. Разумеется, я слишком понимаю, что это только случай; но ведь таких-то случаев я и ищу, для того-то и порешил жить на улице. Ну пусть эти случаи даже слишком редки; все равно, главным правилом будет у меня – не рисковать ничем, и второе – непременно в день хоть сколько-нибудь нажить сверх минимума, истраченного на мое содержание, для того чтобы ни единого дня не прерывалось накопление.","I proceeded from the following consideration: I have a hundred rubles. In St. Petersburg, there are so many auctions, sales, small shops on Tolkuchy Street and needy people that it is impossible, having bought a thing for so much, not to sell it for a little more. For the album, I took seven rubles ninety-five kopecks of profit for two rubles five kopecks of the capital spent. This huge profit was taken without risk: I saw in my eyes that the buyer would not back down. Of course, I understand too well that this is only a case; but that's the sort of thing I'm looking for, that's why I decided to live on the street. Well, even if these cases are too rare; anyway, my main rule will be - not to risk anything, and the second - by all means to earn at least a little a day in excess of the minimum spent on my maintenance, so that accumulation does not interrupt a single day.","My reasoning went like this: I have a hundred rubles and there are so many auction sales, junk shops, flea markets, and people requiring things in Petersburg that if someone buys something it's inconceivable that he won't be able to sell it for a little more. From that album, I made seven rubles and ninety-five kopeks net profit from an investment of two rubles and five kopeks. That disproportionate amount of profit involved no risk since I could tell from the eyes of the customer that he wouldn't back out. Obviously it was just a lucky break, I know that only too well. But then it's precisely for such lucky breaks that I'm on the lookout; that's why I've decided to live in the streets. But even assuming that such opportunities won't come up too often, it's still all right, for my cardinal rule is never to take any risks and my second rule is to earn every day more than I spend, even if only very little more. The accumulation must be continuous, without stopping for one single day.","I started with the hypothesis that I had a hundred roubles. In Petersburg there are so many auction sales, petty hucksters' booths and people who want things, that it would be impossible not to sell anything one bought for a little more. Over the album I had made seven roubles ninety-five kopecks profit on two roubles five kopecks of capital invested. This immense profit was made without any risk: I could see from his eyes that the purchaser would not back out. Of course I know quite well that this was only a chance; but it is just such chances I am on the look-out for, that is why I have made up my mind to live in the street. Well, granted that such a chance is unusual, no matter; my first principle will be to risk nothing, and the second to make every day more than the minimum spent on my subsistence, that the process of accumulation may not be interrupted for a single day."

"О, мне было жаль Лизу, и в сердце моем была самая нелицемерная боль! Уж одно бы это чувство боли за нее могло бы, кажется, смирить или стереть во мне, хоть на время, плотоядность (опять поминаю это слово). Но меня влекло безмерное любопытство, и какой-то страх, и еще какое-то чувство – не знаю какое; но знаю и знал уже и тогда, что оно было недоброе. Может быть, я стремился пасть к ее ногам, а может быть, хотел бы предать ее на все муки и что-то «поскорей, поскорей» доказать ей. Никакая боль и никакое сострадание к Лизе не могли уже остановить меня. Ну мог ли я встать и уйти домой… к Макару Ивановичу?","Oh, I felt sorry for Liza, and in my heart there was the most unfeigned pain! If only this feeling of pain for her could, it seems, humble or erase in me, at least for a while, carnivorousness (again I remember this word). But I was attracted by an immense curiosity, and some kind of fear, and some other feeling - I don’t know what; but I know and knew even then that it was not good. Maybe I tried to fall at her feet, or maybe I would like to betray her to all the torments and prove something to her “quickly, quickly”. No amount of pain and no compassion for Liza could stop me now. Well, could I get up and go home ... to Makar Ivanovich?","Oh, no doubt, I was sorry for Lisa and my heart was full of the most sincere grief for her. That deep sympathy by itself should, it would seem, have wiped out, or at least toned down, that carnivorous feeling I had (I remember that word). But I was driven by an uncontrolled curiosity, a strange fear, and some other feeling that I cannot define. I only knew (and had known all along) that it was a wicked feeling. Perhaps I was longing to throw myself at her feet, but perhaps too I was longing to torture her and was in a great hurry to prove something to her. No pity, no compassion for Lisa, could stop me now. So how could I possibly get up and go back home ... to be with Makar?","Oh, I was sorry for Liza, and my heart was full of a most unfeigned grief. Nothing but the feeling of pain on her account could have calmed or effaced in me for a time that ""carnivorousness"" (I recall that word). But I was immensely spurred on by curiosity and a sort of dread and another feeling— I don't know what; but I know and I knew then that it was an evil feeling. Perhaps my impulse was to fall at HER feet, or perhaps I wanted to put her to every torture, and ""quickly, quickly"" to show her something. No grief, no compassion for Liza, could stop me. Could I have got up and gone home … to Makar Ivanovitch?"

"Она сама позвала меня к себе в первый раз. Я понимал и тогда, что она, может быть, рассчитывала иногда кой о чем у меня выведать. О, тогда многие могли выведать от меня очень многое! «Но что ж из того, – думал я, – ведь не для этого одного она меня у себя принимает»; одним словом, я даже был рад, что мог быть ей полезным и… и когда я сидел с ней, мне всегда казалось про себя, что это сестра моя сидит подле меня, хоть, однако, про наше родство мы еще ни разу с ней не говорили, ни словом, ни даже намеком, как будто его и не было вовсе.

"Я одевался и спешил к нему неудержимо. Прибавлю: насчет вчерашней выходки его о «документе» я тоже был впятеро спокойнее, чем вчера. Во-первых, я надеялся с ним объясниться, а во-вторых, что же в том, что Ламберт профильтровался и к нему и об чем-то там поговорил с ним? Но главная радость моя была в одном чрезвычайном ощущении: это была мысль, что он уже «не любил ее «; в это я уверовал ужасно и чувствовал, что с сердца моего как бы кто-то столкнул страшный камень. Помню даже промелькнувшую тогда одну догадку: именно безобразие и бессмыслица той последней яростной вспышки его при известии о Бьоринге и отсылка оскорбительного тогдашнего письма; именно эта крайность и могла служить как бы пророчеством и предтечей самой радикальной перемены в чувствах его и близкого возвращения его к здравому смыслу; это должно было быть почти как в болезни, думал я, и он именно должен был прийти к противоположной точке – медицинский эпизод и больше ничего! Мысль эта делала меня счастливым.","I dressed and hurried to him irresistibly. I will add: about yesterday's antics of his about the ""document"" I was also five times calmer than yesterday. Firstly, I hoped to explain myself to him, and secondly, what about the fact that Lambert filtered through to him and talked about something with him? But my main joy was in one extraordinary sensation: it was the thought that he no longer “loved her”; I terribly believed this and felt that it was as if someone had pushed a terrible stone from my heart. I even remember one guess that flashed through then: precisely the disgrace and nonsense of that last furious outburst of him at the news of Björing and the sending of an insulting letter of that time; it was precisely this extreme that could serve as a kind of prophecy and forerunner of the most radical change in his feelings and his close return to common sense; it must have been almost like an illness, I thought, and it must have come to the opposite point - a medical episode and nothing else! This thought made me happy.","I dressed in a hurry because I was impatient to see him. And let me add that the fact that he'd used the word ""document"" didn't worry me nearly as much as it had the previous night. In any case, I hoped to discuss everything with him, even if Lambert had managed to get to him and had told him about certain things. I no longer saw why I should be so upset by whatever Lambert may have told him. But the main source of my joy was located in one momentous fact: he did not love her. I believed that unquestioningly and it was as though someone had lifted a horrible weight off my chest. I remember a thought that flashed through my mind as I was dressing: the ugly and senseless fury of his explosion upon learning about her engagement to Bjoring and his sending of that insulting letter, indeed the very violence of his reaction, all could have been a sign of the forthcoming radical change in his feelings and of his rapid return to sanity. It was almost like an illness, I thought, just a pathological episode, and now the reaction must be coming. . . . That thought filled me with joy.","I asked her joyfully: ""whether she came from him?"" and heard with vexation that she did not come from him, but from Anna Andreyevna, and that she, Darya Onisimovna, ""had left the lodging as soon as it was light."""

Сознание об этом поступке было мне всегдашним укором. Под влиянием обстоятельств и опасений я усумнилась в моем милом, великодушном отце. Зная, что это письмо могло попасть… в руки злых людей… имея полные основания так думать (с жаром произнесла она), я трепетала, что им воспользуются, покажут папа… а на него это могло произвести чрезвычайное впечатление… в его положении… на здоровье его… и он бы меня разлюбил… Да, – прибавила она, смотря мне ясно в глаза и, вероятно, поймав на лету что-то в моем взгляде, – да, я боялась тоже и за участь мою: я боялась, что он… под влиянием своей болезни… мог лишить меня и своих милостей… Это чувство тоже входило, но я, наверно, и тут перед ним виновата: он так добр и великодушен, что, конечно, бы меня простил.

"Без сомнения, возразят, что это уж поэзия и что никогда я не выпущу миллионов, если они попадутся, и не обращусь в саратовского нищего. Может быть, и не выпущу; я начертал лишь идеал моей мысли. Но прибавлю уже серьезно: если б я дошел, в накоплении богатства, до такой цифры, как у Ротшильда, то действительно могло бы кончиться тем, что я бросил бы их обществу. (Впрочем, раньше ротшильдской цифры трудно бы было это исполнить.) И не половину бы отдал, потому что тогда вышла бы одна пошлость: я стал бы только вдвое беднее и больше ничего; но именно все, все до копейки, потому что, став нищим, я вдруг стал бы вдвое богаче Ротшильда! Если этого не поймут, то я не виноват; разъяснять не буду!","Without a doubt, they will object that this is poetry and that I will never release millions if they get caught, and I will not turn into a Saratov beggar. Maybe I won't let it out; I have outlined only the ideal of my thought. But I will add seriously: if I had reached, in the accumulation of wealth, such a figure as that of Rothschild, then it really could have ended with the fact that I would have thrown them to society. (However, it would have been difficult to do this before the Rothschild figure.) And I wouldn’t have given half, because then it would have turned out to be one vulgarity: I would only become twice as poor and nothing more; but precisely everything, everything to the penny, because, having become a beggar, I would suddenly become twice as rich as Rothschild! If this is not understood, then I am not to blame; I will not explain!","I'm sure people would tell me that it all may sound great but, if I did somehow get hold of a few million, I'd never let go of them again in order to end up as another Volga beggar. Maybe I wouldn't: I was simply trying to explain the principle underlying my idea. But let me say this quite seriously: if I really succeeded in accumulating enough money to put me into Rothschild's class, it's quite possible that I'd end up tossing it all away to the public. (With less than a Rothschild-size fortune, however, I realize it would be very difficult to do.) And if I were to give it away, it wouldn't be just half of it because that would only be a show in bad taste, which would make me, so to speak, twice as poor without accomplishing anything else. No, I'd give up everything, down to the last kopek; for then, becoming a beggar, I'd be twice as rich as Rothschild! Well, if they can't understand this, it's not my fault, so why should I take the trouble of trying to explain it to them?","No doubt I shall be told that this is all romance, and that if I got my millions I should not give them up and become a beggar. Perhaps I should not. I have simply sketched the ideal in my mind. But I will add seriously that if I did succeed in piling up as much money as Rothschild, that it really might end in my giving it all up to the public (though it would be difficult to do so before I reached that amount). And I shouldn't give away half because that would be simply vulgar: I should be only half as rich, that would be all. I should give away all, all to the last farthing, for on becoming a beggar I should become twice as rich as Rothschild! If other people don't understand this it's not my fault; I'm not going to explain it."

"И так как он решительно ничего не знал про коммунистическое учение, да и самое слово в первый раз услыхал, то я тут же стал ему излагать все, что знал на эту тему. Признаюсь, я знал мало и сбивчиво, да и теперь не совсем компетентен; но что знал, то изложил с величайшим жаром, несмотря ни на что. До сих пор вспоминаю с удовольствием о чрезвычайном впечатлении, которое я произвел на старика. Это было даже не впечатление, а почти потрясение. При сем он страшно интересовался историческими подробностями: «Где? Как? Кто устроил? Кто сказал?» Кстати, я заметил, что это – вообще свойство простонародья: он не удовольствуется общей идеей, если очень заинтересуется, но непременно начнет требовать самых твердых и точных подробностей. Я таки в подробностях сбивался, и так как тут был Версилов, то немного стыдился его, а оттого еще пуще горячился. Кончилось тем, что Макар Иванович, в умилении, под конец только повторял к каждому слову: «Так, так!», но уже видимо не понимая и потеряв нитку. Мне стало досадно, но Версилов вдруг прервал разговор, встал и объявил, что пора идти спать. Мы тогда все были в сборе, и было поздно. Когда он через несколько минут заглянул в мою комнату, я тотчас спросил его: как он глядит на Макара Ивановича вообще и что он об нем думает? Версилов весело усмехнулся (но вовсе не над моими ошибками в коммунизме – напротив, об них не упомянул). Повторяю опять: он решительно как бы прилепился к Макару Ивановичу, и я часто ловил на лице его чрезвычайно привлекательную улыбку, когда он слушал старика. Впрочем, улыбка вовсе не помешала критике.","And since he absolutely knew nothing about the communist doctrine, and since he heard the very word for the first time, I immediately began to explain to him everything that I knew on this subject. I confess that I knew little and confusedly, and even now I am not quite competent; but what he knew, he expounded with the greatest fervour, in spite of everything. I still remember with pleasure the extraordinary impression I made on the old man. It was not even an impression, but almost a shock. At the same time, he was terribly interested in historical details: “Where? How? Who arranged? Who said?"" By the way, I noticed that this is generally a property of the common people: he will not be satisfied with the general idea, if he is very interested, but will certainly begin to demand the most solid and precise details. I did go astray in the details, and since Versilov was there, I was a little ashamed of him, and that made me even more excited. It ended with Makar Ivanovich, in emotion, at the end only repeating to each word: “So, so!”, But apparently not understanding and losing the thread. I felt vexed, but Versilov suddenly interrupted the conversation, got up and announced that it was time to go to bed. We were all there then, and it was too late. When he looked into my room a few minutes later, I immediately asked him: how does he look at Makar Ivanovich in general and what does he think of him? Versilov chuckled merrily (but not at all at my mistakes in communism - on the contrary, he did not mention them). I repeat again: he decidedly, as it were, clung to Makar Ivanovich, and I often caught an extremely attractive smile on his face when he listened to the old man. However, the smile did not prevent criticism at all.","Since he knew nothing about the communist doctrine and, indeed, had never heard the word communism before, I immediately proceeded to expound to him all I knew on the subject. I must admit that my own notions were scanty and vague, for I was hardly an expert on communism. Nevertheless I described with tremendous heat whatever I knew on the subject. And, to this day, I recall with a pleasant feeling the profound impression I made on the old man. In fact, it was more than an impression, it was a shock. Also, he was extremely interested in the historical details: ""Where? How? Who organized it? Who said that?"" In general, this is a peculiar feature of simple people: they're never contented with an abstract idea and always demand concrete and precise details. But since I got some of these details wrong and since Versilov was present, I became more and more embarrassed, which in turn made me speak more and more excitedly. Still, in the end, Makar was so moved that he could only accompany every statement of mine with an approving ""Right, right!"" because by then he'd probably lost the thread of what I was saying and was no longer following me anyway. That rather annoyed me. Still it went on until Versilov finally got up and announced it was time to go to bed. And, true enough, it was getting quite late. When, a few minutes later, Versilov stepped into my room, I asked him what he thought of Makar's idea and of the man in general. Versilov smiled with amusement (not at my mistakes about communism —he never mentioned them). I repeat again, he was quite fascinated by the old man, and I'd often noticed him smiling delightedly before as he listened to Makar talk. However, this did not prevent Versilov from having his reservations.","And as he knew absolutely nothing of the doctrine of communism, and heard the word indeed for the first time, I began at once expounding to him all I knew on the subject. I must confess my knowledge was scanty and confused, even now, in fact, it is not very ample. But in spite of that I discoursed with great heat on what I did know. To this day I recall with pleasure the extraordinary impression I made on the old man. It was more than an impression. It was really an overwhelming effect. He was passionately interested, too, in the historical details, asking, ""Where? How? Who arranged it? Who said so? "" I have noticed, by the way, that that is characteristic of the Russian peasant. If he is much interested he is not content with general ideas, but insists on having the most solid and exact facts. It was just for such details that I was at a loss, and as Versilov was present I felt ashamed of my incompetence, and that made me hotter than ever. In the end Makar Ivanovitch could do nothing but repeat with emotion, ""Yes: yes!"" though he had evidently lost the thread and did not understand. I felt vexed, but Versilov interrupted the conversation and said it was bedtime. We were all in the room and it was late. But when he peeped into my room a few minutes later I asked him at once what he thought of Makar Ivanovitch, and what was his opinion of him? Versilov laughed gaily (but not at my mistakes about communism—he did not mention them in fact). I repeat again, he seemed absolutely devoted to Makar Ivanovitch, and I often caught a very attractive smile on his face when he was listening to the old man. At the same time this smile did not prevent his criticising him."

То есть я говорю красивый, как и все про него точно так же говорили, но что-то было в этом молодом и красивом лице не совсем привлекательное. Я именно замечаю это, как впечатление самого первого мгновения, первого на него моего взгляда, оставшееся во мне на все время. Он был сухощав, прекрасного роста, темно-рус, с свежим лицом, немного, впрочем, желтоватым, и с решительным взглядом. Прекрасные темные глаза его смотрели несколько сурово, даже и когда он был совсем спокоен. Но решительный взгляд его именно отталкивал потому, что как-то чувствовалось почему-то, что решимость эта ему слишком недорого стоила. Впрочем, не умею выразиться… Конечно, лицо его способно было вдруг изменяться с сурового на удивительно ласковое, кроткое и нежное выражение, и, главное, при несомненном простодушии превращения. Это-то простодушие и привлекало. Замечу еще черту: несмотря на ласковость и простодушие, никогда это лицо не становилось веселым; даже когда князь хохотал от всего сердца, вы все-таки чувствовали, что настоящей, светлой, легкой веселости как будто никогда не было в его сердце… Впрочем, чрезвычайно трудно так описывать лицо. Не умею я этого вовсе. Старый князь тотчас же бросился нас знакомить, по глупой своей привычке.","A young and handsome officer entered. I looked at him greedily, I had never seen him before. That is, I say handsome, like everyone else said about him in the same way, but there was something in this young and handsome face that was not entirely attractive. I notice this precisely as an impression of the very first moment, my first glance at it, which has remained in me for all time. He was lean, of excellent height, dark blond, with a fresh face, however, a little yellowish, and with a determined look. His beautiful dark eyes looked somewhat stern, even when he was quite calm. But his resolute look repulsed him precisely because it somehow felt for some reason that this determination cost him too little. However, I don’t know how to express myself… Of course, his face was capable of suddenly changing from a stern expression to a remarkably affectionate, meek and gentle expression, and, most importantly, with an undeniable innocence of transformation. It was this innocence that attracted me. I will also note a trait: in spite of affectionateness and innocence, this face never became cheerful; even when the prince laughed from the bottom of his heart, you still felt that real, bright, easy gaiety seemed to have never been in his heart ... However, it is extremely difficult to describe a face like that. I can't do it at all. The old prince immediately rushed to introduce us, out of his stupid habit.","A handsome young officer walked in. I had never seen Prince Sergei Sokolsky before and proceeded to examine him with curiosity. To say he was handsome would simply repeat what everyone said about him, but there was something rather unpleasant in his regular features and young face. That unpleasantness struck me the very first second I saw him and the impression always remained with me. He was lean and very tall; his hair was dark brown and his face looked healthy and tanned. There was a cold and hard intensity in his beautiful dark eyes, even though he seemed perfectly relaxed. I think it was that determined look of his that repelled me particularly, because I felt that his determination didn't cost him any effort. . . . But I don't really know how to explain what I mean. ... Of course, his face could suddenly shed its coldness and become extremely warm and open, although never gay, not even when he rolled with laughter; even then you could feel that he had never known the real, light, and cheerful abandon of gaiety. . . . But it's very difficult to describe a man's face this way and I simply haven't got the knack. According to his usual stupid habit, the old prince immediately rushed to introduce me:","A handsome young officer walked in. I looked at him eagerly, I had never seen him before. I call him handsome for every one called him so, but there was something not altogether attractive in that handsome young face. I note this as the impression made the first instant, my first view of him, which remained with me always. He was thin and finely built, with brown hair, a fresh but somewhat sallow skin and an expression of determination. There was a rather hard look in his beautiful dark eyes even when he was perfectly calm. But his resolute expression repelled one just because one felt that its resoluteness cost him little. But I cannot put it into words… . It is true that his face was able to change suddenly from hardness to a wonderfully friendly, gentle and tender expression, and, what is more, with unmistakable frankness. It was just that frankness which was attractive. I will note another characteristic: in spite of its friendliness and frankness his face never looked gay; oven when he laughed with whole-hearted mirth there was always a feeling that there was no trace in his heart of genuine, serene, lighthearted gaiety… . But it is extremely difficult to describe a face like this. I'm utterly incapable of it. In his usual stupid way the old prince hastened to introduce us."

"В это утро, пятнадцатого ноября, я именно застал его у «князя Сережи». Я же и свел его с князем, но у них и без меня было довольно пунктов соединения (я говорю об этих прежних историях за границей и проч.). Кроме того, князь дал ему слово выделить ему из наследства по крайней мере одну треть, что составило бы тысяч двадцать непременно. Мне, помню, ужасно тогда было странно, что он выделяет всего треть, а не целую половину; но я смолчал. Это обещание выделить князь дал тогда сам собой; Версилов ни полсловечком не участвовал, не заикнулся; князь сам выскочил, а Версилов только молча допустил и ни разу потом не упомянул, даже и виду не показал, что сколько-нибудь помнит об обещании. Замечу кстати, что князь вначале был им решительно очарован, в особенности речами его, даже приходил в восторг и несколько раз мне высказывался. Он иногда восклицал наедине со мной и почти с отчаянием про себя, что он – «так необразован, что он на такой ложной дороге!..» О, мы были еще тогда так дружны!.. Я и Версилову все старался внушать тогда о князе одно хорошее, защищал его недостатки, хотя и видел их сам; но Версилов отмалчивался или улыбался.","On this morning, the fifteenth of November, it was I who found him at ""Prince Seryozha."" It was I who brought him together with the prince, but even without me they had enough points of connection (I am talking about these former stories abroad, etc.). In addition, the prince gave him the word to allocate to him from the inheritance at least one third, which would have amounted to twenty thousand without fail. I remember it was terribly strange then that he would allocate only a third, and not a whole half; but I was silent. This promise to allocate the prince gave then by itself; Versilov did not participate in the slightest, did not hint; the prince himself jumped out, and Versilov only silently admitted and never once mentioned, did not even show that he remembered the promise in the slightest. By the way, I note that the prince was at first decisively fascinated by him, especially by his speeches, he even became delighted and spoke out to me several times. He sometimes exclaimed, alone with me, and almost in despair to himself, that he was “so uneducated that he is on such a false road! ..” Oh, we were so friendly even then! one good thing, he defended his shortcomings, although he saw them himself; but Versilov remained silent or smiled.","On the morning of November 15, I found Versilov at Sergei's. It was I who'd brought them together, although there were many things that would've brought them together without me (I mean all that business between them abroad, etc.). Besides, Sergei had insisted that Versilov should accept at least one-third of the inheritance, which might amount to twenty thousand rubles or more. I remember thinking it rather peculiar that Sergei should insist on a third rather than half the inheritance, but I kept it to myself. Sergei had made that promise of his own accord; Versilov had never suggested any such thing. When Sergei came up with the idea, Versilov listened to the offer without turning it down, but after that he never reminded Sergei of it, indeed, never indicated that he hadn't forgotten all about it. Let me note here that, at first, Sergei was completely spellbound by Versilov, especially by the things he said, and he even told me about his enthusiastic admiration. Sometimes, when the two of us were alone, Sergei would exclaim in despair how ignorant and unworthy he was compared to Versilov. That was when we were still good friends. For my part, I tried to impress Versilov with Sergei's best points and played down his weaknesses, of which I was well aware. But Versilov only smiled as he listened to me.","On that morning, the 15th of November, I found him at Prince Sergay's. I had brought the prince and him together, but they had ties apart from me (I mean the affair abroad, and all that). Moreover, the prince had promised to divide the disputed fortune with him, giving him a third, which would mean twenty thousand at least. I remember at the time I thought it awfully strange that he was giving him only a third and not the full half; but I said nothing. Prince Sergay gave this promise of his own accord; Versilov had not said a syllable to suggest it, had not dropped a hint. Prince Sergay came forward himself and Versilov only let it pass in silence, never once alluded to it, and showed no sign that he had the least recollection of a promise. I may mention, by the way, that Prince Sergay was absolutely enchanted with him at first and still more with the things he said. He fell into positive raptures about him, and several times expressed his feelings to me. Sometimes when he was alone with me he exclaimed about himself, almost with despair, that he was ""so ill-educated, that he was on the wrong track! … "" Oh, we were still so friendly then! … I kept trying to impress Versilov with Prince Sergay's good points only, and excused his defects though I saw them myself; but Versilov listened in silence, or smiled."

"Повлияло на мой отъезд из Москвы и еще одно могущественное обстоятельство, один соблазн, от которого уже и тогда, еще за три месяца пред выездом (стало быть, когда и помину не было о Петербурге), у меня уже поднималось и билось сердце! Меня тянуло в этот неизвестный океан еще и потому, что я прямо мог войти в него властелином и господином даже чужих судеб, да еще чьих! Но великодушные, а не деспотические чувства кипели во мне – предуведомляю заранее, чтоб не вышло ошибки из слов моих. К тому же Версилов мог думать (если только удостоивал обо мне думать), что вот едет маленький мальчик, отставной гимназист, подросток, и удивляется на весь свет. А я меж тем уже знал всю его подноготную и имел на себе важнейший документ, за который (теперь уж я знаю это наверно) он отдал бы несколько лет своей жизни, если б я открыл ему тогда тайну. Впрочем, я замечаю, что наставил загадок. Без фактов чувств не опишешь. К тому же обо всем этом слишком довольно будет на своем месте, затем и перо взял. А так писать – похоже на бред или облако.","Another powerful circumstance also influenced my departure from Moscow, one temptation, from which even then, three months before my departure (hence, when there was no mention of Petersburg), my heart was already rising and beating! I was also drawn to this unknown ocean because I could directly enter into it as the ruler and master of even other people's destinies, and even whose ones! But magnanimous, and not despotic feelings seethed in me - I warn you in advance so that no mistake comes out of my words. Moreover, Versilov could think (if he only deigned to think of me) that here comes a little boy, a retired schoolboy, a teenager, and is surprised at the whole world. Meanwhile, I already knew all the ins and outs of him and had on me the most important document, for which (now I know this for sure) he would have given several years of his life if I had revealed the secret to him then. However, I notice that I have instructed riddles. Feelings cannot be described without facts. Besides, all this will be too content in its place, then he took the pen. And writing like that is like nonsense or a cloud.","There was another very strong reason for me to leave Moscow. For three months, that is, before the question of my going to Petersburg even came up, there had been something that would grab my heart and force it to pound wildly in my chest. That uncharted ocean tempted me so much because I felt I could enter it as lord and master of the destinies of other people, and what people! But lest there be any misunderstanding about it , let me state clearly right now that the feelings seething within me were magnanimous, in no way despotic. Besides, if he ever deigned to give a thought to me, Versilov was most likely expecting a young boy just out of high school, still a mere adolescent, gaping at the world in wide-eyed wonderment. In actual fact, however, I had found out certain things about him and was in possession of a certain document for which he would have willingly paid several years of his life (this I know for certain today, for I realize how important that secret was to him). I realize now that what I have written here is full of riddles. But, then, how is one to convey feelings without first presenting the facts. Everything will be amply explained in its proper place because this was my purpose in writing it all down in the first place. Just writing things down any old way would produce delirious ravings or a cloud of words.","Another thing which influenced me in leaving Moscow was a tremendous circumstance, a temptation which even then, three months before my departure (before Petersburg had been mentioned), set my heart leaping and throbbing. I was drawn to this unknown ocean by the thought that I could enter it as the lord and master of other people's destinies, and what people, too! But the feelings that were surging in my heart were generous and not despotic—I hasten to declare it that my words may not be mistaken. Moreover, Versilov might think (if he ever deigned to think of me) that a small boy who had just left school, a raw youth, was coming who would be agape with wonder at everything. And meanwhile I knew all his private life, and had about me a document of the utmost importance, for which (I know that now for a fact) he would have given some years of his life, if I had told him the secret at the time. But I notice that I am talking in riddles. One cannot describe feelings without facts. Besides which, there will be enough about all this in its proper place; it is with that object I have taken up my pen. Writing like this is like a cloud of words or the ravings of delirium."

Had Prince Sergay been alone, that is had we not been present, he would certainly have been more dignified and more resourceful. As it was, something tremulous in his smile, possibly an excess of politeness, and a strange absent-mindedness, betrayed him."

"И случилось дело. Только он раз вышел, а мальчик вскочил из-за книги да на стул: пред тем на шифонерку мяч забросил, так чтоб мячик ему достать, да об фарфоровую лампу на шифонерке рукавом и зацепил; лампа-то грохнулась, да на пол, да вдребезги, ажно по всему дому зазвенело, а вещь дорогая – фарфор саксонский. А тут вдруг Максим Иванович из третьей комнаты услышал и завопил. Бросился ребенок бежать куда глаза глядят с перепугу, выбежал на террасу, да через сад, да задней калиткой прямо на набережную. А по набережной там бульвар идет, старые ракиты стоят, место веселое. Сбежал он вниз к воде, люди видели, сплеснул руками, у самого того места, где паром пристает, да ужаснулся, что ли, перед водой – стал как вкопанный. А место это широкое, река быстрая, барки проходят; на той стороне лавки, площадь, храм Божий златыми главами сияет. И как раз тут на перевоз поспешала с дочкой полковница Ферзинг – полк стоял пехотный. Дочка, тоже ребеночек лет восьми, идет в беленьком платьице, смотрит на мальчика и смеется, а в руках таку малую кошелочку деревенскую несет, а в кошелочке ежика. «Смотрите, говорит, маменька, как мальчик смотрит на моего ежика». – «Нет, – говорит полковница, – а он испугался чего-то. – Чего вы так испугались, хорошенький мальчик?» (Так все это потом и рассказывали.) «И какой, говорит, это хорошенький мальчик, и как хорошо одет; чей вы, говорит, мальчик?» А он никогда еще ежика не видывал, подступил, и смотрит, и уже забыл – детский возраст! «Что это, говорит, у вас такое?» – «А это, – говорит барышня, – у нас ежик, мы сейчас у деревенского мужика купили: он в лесу нашел». – «Как же это, говорит, такой ежик?» – и уж смеется, и стал он его тыкать пальчиком, а ежик-то щетинится, а девочка-то рада на мальчика: «Мы, говорит, его домой несем и хотим приучать». – «Ах, говорит, подарите мне вашего ежика!» И так он это ее умильно попросил, и только что выговорит, как вдруг Максим-то Иванович над ним сверху: «А! Вот ты где! Держи его!» (До того озверел, что сам без шапки из дому погнался за ним.) Мальчик, как вспомнил про все, вскрикнул, бросился к воде, прижал себе к обеим грудкам по кулачку, посмотрел в небеса (видели, видели!) – да бух в воду! Ну, закричали, бросились с парома, стали ловить, да водой отнесло, река быстрая, а как вытащили, уж и захлебнулся, – мертвенький. Грудкой-то слаб был, не стерпел воды, да и много ль такому надо? И вот на памяти людской еще не было в тех местах, чтобы такой малый робеночек на свою жизнь посягнул! Такой грех! И что может сия малая душка на том свете Господу Богу сказать!","And the thing happened. As soon as he went out, the boy jumped up from behind the book and onto a chair: before that, he threw a ball at the chiffoner, so that he could get the ball, but on the porcelain lamp on the chiffoner with his sleeve and hooked it; the lamp crashed, and on the floor, and to smithereens, it rang all over the house, and the expensive thing was Saxon porcelain. And then suddenly Maxim Ivanovich from the third room heard and yelled. The child rushed to run wherever his eyes looked with fright, ran out onto the terrace, and through the garden, and through the back gate straight onto the embankment. And along the embankment there is a boulevard, old willows stand, a cheerful place. He ran down to the water, people saw him, clasped his hands, at the very place where the ferry docked, but he was horrified, perhaps, before the water - he stood in his tracks. And this place is wide, the river is fast, the barges pass; on the other side of the shop, the square, the temple of God shines with golden heads. And just then, Colonel Ferzing hurried to the transport with her daughter - the regiment was infantry. The daughter, also a child of about eight years old, walks in a little white dress, looks at the boy and laughs, and in her hands she carries such a small village purse, and in a purse a hedgehog. “Look, mother says, how the boy looks at my hedgehog.” “No,” says the colonel, “but he was afraid of something. “What are you so afraid of, pretty boy?” (So they all told it later.) “And what a pretty boy, he says, and how well he is dressed; whose boy are you, he says? But he had never seen a hedgehog before, approached and looked, and already forgot - childhood! ""What is it, he says, you have it?"" “And this,” says the young lady, “we have a hedgehog, we just bought it from a village peasant: he found it in the forest.” - ""How is it, he says, such a hedgehog?"" - and he’s already laughing, and he began to poke him with his finger, and the hedgehog bristles, and the girl is glad for the boy: “We, he says, are bringing him home and want to teach him.” - ""Ah, he says, give me your hedgehog!"" And so he touchingly asked her this, and he would just utter it, when suddenly Maxim Ivanovich was above him from above: “Ah! Where are you! Hold him!"" (He became so brutalized that he himself chased him out of the house without a hat.) The boy, as he remembered everything, screamed, rushed to the water, pressed his fist to both breasts, looked into the heavens (saw, saw!) - yes, bang in water! Well, they shouted, rushed from the ferry, began to catch it, but it was carried away by water, the river was fast, but as soon as they pulled it out, it choked, it was dead. The breast was weak, could not stand the water, and how much does this need? And now, in human memory, there has not yet been in those places that such a small robot encroached on his life! Such a sin! And what can this little darling in the other world say to the Lord God!","And then something happened. Once, when Maxim left the room, the boy put down his book, jumped up on a chair to get his ball, which he'd thrown on top of the sideboard. As he was reaching for it, his sleeve caught in a china lamp that fell to the floor smashing into a thousand pieces so that the whole house resounded. It was an expensive Saxony china lamp. Maxim, who was two rooms away, heard the crash and roared with anger. The boy, frightened to death, rushed out onto the verandah, then into the garden, and started running, not knowing where he was going. He crossed the garden, went out the back gate, and reached the riverbank where there was a sort of promenade along the river lined with old willow trees, a pretty place. People saw the boy run down to the water, to the jetty where the ferry was tied, stretch his arms toward the water, and then stop dead, terrified. The river was wide at that spot and the current was swift and barges were passing. . . . On the opposite bank of the river there was a square with shops and a church with the sun shining on its golden cupolas. And it so happened that, just at that moment, the wife of Colonel Ferzing, the commanding officer of the infantry regiment stationed in the town, came down to take the ferry. She had with her a little girl in a pretty white dress, her daughter, a child of eight or so. The little girl held in her hand a basket of the kind the peasants make. In that basket was a hedgehog. ""Mummy, why is that little boy looking at my hedgehog like that?"" ""No, darling,"" Mrs. Ferzing said, ""he seems to have been frightened by something. . . . What frightened you like that, nice little boy? (That's exactly what she called him, as all those who heard her repeated later.) Ah, you are such a nice and pretty little boy and you're so beautifully dressed! Whose boy are you?"" The little boy, who'd never seen a hedgehog before, came closer and was staring at it. He'd forgotten all his troubles by now, for that's how young children are. ""What's that you have there?"" ""It's a hedgehog,"" the little girl said; ""we just bought it from a peasant who found it in the forest."" ""What's a hedgehog?"" the little boy said, and he was already laughing and poking his finger into the animal, who put up its bristles, and the little girl was laughing happily, looking at the boy. ""We're going to take him home and tame him,"" she said. ""Ah . . . Please can I have your hedgehog? "" The way he asked sounded as if he wanted it very much, the hedgehog. But hardly had the boy uttered these words than Maxim appeared on top of the bank above them. ""There he is!"" Maxim screamed. ""Get him, get a hold of him!"" He must have rushed out of the house like a madman to catch the boy: he was hatless and in a rage. Now everything, of course, came back to the boy: he let out a cry, stepped to the edge of the water, pressed his little fists against his chest, looked up at the sky —yes, they all saw him do that—and jumped. Splash! There were cries, shouts, screams; some men dove from the ferry, but the swift current carried the boy off so that by the time they'd pulled him out he'd swallowed lots of water and it was too late. He was too delicate anyway: it'd been more than he could take. Besides, how much does it take to kill a weak little boy like that? No one from those parts remembered ever having heard of a small child taking his own life. That was a terrible sin. For what can such a young soul tell our Lord in the next world?","And something happened. One day, as soon as he'd gone out, the boy left his book and jumped on to a chair. He had thrown his ball on to the top of the sideboard, and now he wanted to get it, and his sleeve caught in a china lamp on the sideboard, the lamp fell to the floor and was smashed to pieces, and the crash was heard all over the house, and it was an expensive thing, made of Saxony china. And Maxim Ivanovitch heard at once, though he was two rooms away, and he yelled. The boy rushed away in terror. He ran out on the verandah, across the garden, and through the back gate on to the river-bank. And there was a boulevard running along the river- bank, there were old willows there, it was a pleasant place. He ran down to the water, people saw, and clasped his hands at the very place where the ferry-boat comes in, but seemed frightened of the water, and stood as though turned to stone. And it's a broad open space, the river is swift there, and boats pass by; on the other side there are shops, a square, a temple of God, shining with golden domes. And just then Mme. Ferzing, the colonel's wife, came hurrying down to the ferry with her little daughter. The daughter, who was also a child of eight, was wearing a little white frock; she looked at the boy and laughed, and she was carrying a little country basket, and in it a hedgehog. "" Look, mother,"" said she, ""how the boy is looking at my hedgehog!"" ""No,"" said the lady, ""he's frightened of something. What are you afraid of, pretty boy?"" (All this was told afterwards.) ""And what a pretty boy,"" she said; ""and how nicely he's dressed. Whose boy are you?"" she asked. And he'd never seen a hedgehog before, he went up and looked, and forgot everything at once—such is childhood! ""What is it you have got there?"" he asked. ""It's a hedgehog,"" said the little lady, ""we've just bought it from a peasant, he found it in the woods."" ""What's that,"" he asked, ""what is a hedgehog?"" and he began laughing and poking it with his finger, and the hedgehog put up its bristles, and the little girl was delighted with the boy. ""We'll take it home with us and tame it,"" she said. ""Ach,"" said he, ""do give me your hedgehog!"" And he asked her this so pleadingly, and he'd hardly uttered the words, when Maxim Ivanovitch came running down upon him. "" Ah, there you are! Hold him!"" (He was in such a rage, that he'd run out of the house after him, without a hat.) Then the boy remembered everything, he screamed, and ran to the water, pressed his little fists against his breast, looked up at the sky (they saw it, they saw it!) and leapt into the water. Well, people cried out, and jumped from the ferry, tried to get him out, but the current carried him away. The river was rapid, and when they got him out, the little thing was dead. His chest was weak, he couldn't stand being in the water, his hold on life was weak. And such a thing had never been known in those parts, a little child like that to take its life! What a sin! And what could such a little soul say to our Lord God in the world beyond?"

"А впрочем, теперь, доведя мои записки именно до этого пункта, я решаюсь рассказать и «мою идею». Опишу ее в словах, в первый раз с ее зарождения. Я решаюсь, так сказать, открыть ее читателю, и тоже для ясности дальнейшего изложения. Да и не только читатель, а и сам я, сочинитель, начинаю путаться в трудности объяснять шаги мои, не объяснив, что вело и наталкивало меня на них. Этою «фигурою умолчания» я, от неуменья моего, впал опять в те «красоты» романистов, которые сам осмеял выше. Входя в дверь моего петербургского романа со всеми позорными моими в нем приключениями, я нахожу это предисловие необходимым. Но не «красоты» соблазнили меня умолчать до сих пор, а и сущность дела, то есть трудность дела; даже теперь, когда уже прошло все прошедшее, я ощущаю непреодолимую трудность рассказать эту «мысль». Кроме того, я, без сомнения, должен изложить ее в ее тогдашней форме, то есть как она сложилась и мыслилась у меня тогда, а не теперь, а это уже новая трудность. Рассказывать иные вещи почти невозможно. Именно те идеи, которые всех проще, всех яснее, – именно те-то и трудно понять. Если б Колумб перед открытием Америки стал рассказывать свою идею другим, я убежден, что его бы ужасно долго не поняли. Да и не понимали же. Говоря это, я вовсе не думаю равнять себя с Колумбом, и если кто выведет это, тому будет стыдно и больше ничего.","But now, having brought my notes to this very point, I decide to tell ""my idea"" as well. I will describe it in words, for the first time since its inception. I make up my mind, so to speak, to open it to the reader, and also for the sake of clarity of further presentation. And not only the reader, but I myself, the writer, begin to get confused in the difficulty of explaining my steps without explaining what led me and pushed me to them. With this ""figure of silence"" I, from my inability, fell again into those ""beauties"" of novelists, which I myself ridiculed above. Entering the door of my St. Petersburg novel with all my shameful adventures in it, I find this preface necessary. But it was not ""beauties"" that tempted me to remain silent until now, but the essence of the matter, that is, the difficulty of the matter; even now, when all the past has already passed, I feel an insurmountable difficulty in telling this ""thought"". In addition, I, without a doubt, must present it in its then form, that is, how it took shape and was conceived by me then, and not now, and this is already a new difficulty. It's almost impossible to say otherwise. It is precisely those ideas that are simpler and clearer than all that are precisely those that are difficult to understand. If Columbus, before the discovery of America, had begun to tell his idea to others, I am convinced that he would have been misunderstood for a terribly long time. Yes, they did not understand. In saying this, I do not at all think of equating myself with Columbus, and if anyone deduces this, he will be ashamed and nothing else.","Having brought my narrative to this point, I've suddenly decided that it's time to explain my ""idea. "" I shall put it into words for the first time since its inception. I have decided to reveal it to the reader so that the rest of my story will make more sense to him. And it's not only for the reader's sake. I myself begin to find it difficult to account for my various actions without presenting my great underlying motivation. By keeping the reader in ignorance, I clumsily fell for the novelistic device that I tried to ridicule at the outset. Before going any deeper into my Petersburg story with all the events in which I am to play a disgraceful part, I consider this preliminary explanation quite indispensable. But it was not considerations of literary ""prettiness"" that have prevented me from explaining things until now, but the very nature of what I'm trying to say, that is, the difficulty of making it understandable. And even now when it's all in the past, I still find it infinitely hard to describe ""my idea."" Moreover, I feel I must present it in the original form in which I conceived it at the time rather than the way I see it now, and this presents yet another difficulty. There are things that are almost impossible to convey, particularly the simplest and clearest ideas, for these are the most difficult ones to understand. If, before discovering America, Columbus had tried to explain his idea to other people, I'm sure that it would have taken him an awfully long time to be understood. Besides, he wasn't understood. This doesn't mean I'm trying to compare myself with Columbus, and if anyone infers anything of that sort, he should be ashamed of himself.","Having brought my story to this point, I am determined to describe my ""idea"" too. For the first time since its conception I will translate it into words. I am determined to reveal it, so to speak, to the reader, partly for the sake of greater clearness in what I have to explain further. And it is not only confusing for the reader; even I, the author, am beginning to get muddled by the difficulty of explaining each step without explaining what led up to it and induced me to take it. By keeping up this ""attitude of silence"" I have clumsily descended to one of those ""literary graces"" which I have ridiculed above. Before entering upon my Petersburg romance with all my ignominious adventures in it, I find this preface is necessary. But I was not tempted to silence for the sake of literary ""grace"" but was forced to it by the nature of the case, that is, the difficulty of the case; even now, when it is all over, I find it very difficult to put this idea into words. Besides, I must describe it in its aspect at that time, that is, the form it took and the way I looked at it, not now, but then, and that is a fresh difficulty. To describe some things is almost impossible. The ideas that are the simplest and the clearest are the most difficult to understand. If before the discovery of America Columbus had begun telling his idea to other people, I am convinced that for a very long time people would not have understood him. And indeed they did not understand him. I don't mean to compare myself with Columbus, and if anyone imagines that I do he ought to be ashamed of himself, that's all."

"– Друг Аркадий, теперь душа моя умилилась, и я возмутился духом. Я никогда не забуду моих тогдашних первых мгновений в Европе. Я и прежде живал в Европе, но тогда было время особенное, и никогда я не въезжал туда с такою безотрадною грустью и… с такою любовью, как в то время. Я расскажу тебе одно из первых тогдашних впечатлений моих, один мой тогдашний сон, действительный сон. Это случилось еще в Германии. Я только что выехал из Дрездена и в рассеянности проехал станцию, с которой должен был поворотить на мою дорогу, и попал на другую ветвь. Меня тотчас высадили; был третий час пополудни, день ясный. Это был маленький немецкий городок. Мне указали гостиницу. Надо было выждать: следующий поезд проходил в одиннадцать часов ночи. Я даже был доволен приключением, потому что никуда особенно не спешил. Я скитался, друг мой, я скитался. Гостиница оказалась дрянная и маленькая, но вся в зелени и обставлена клумбами цветов, как всегда у них. Мне дали тесную комнатку, и так как я всю ночь был в дороге, то и заснул после обеда, в четыре часа пополудни.","- Friend Arkady, now my soul has been touched, and my spirit has been indignant. I will never forget my first moments in Europe then. I had lived in Europe before, but at that time it was a special time, and I had never entered there with such desolate sadness and ... with such love as at that time. I will tell you one of my first impressions then, one of my dreams then, a real dream. It happened back in Germany. I had just left Dresden and absent-mindedly passed the station from which I was supposed to turn onto my road, and got on another branch. I was immediately dropped off; It was three o'clock in the afternoon, the day was clear. It was a small German town. I was shown a hotel. We had to wait: the next train passed at eleven o'clock at night. I was even pleased with the adventure, because I was not in a particular hurry to get anywhere. I wandered, my friend, I wandered. The hotel turned out to be crappy and small, but all in greenery and furnished with flower beds, as always with them. They gave me a cramped room, and since I was on the road all night, I fell asleep after dinner, at four o'clock in the afternoon.","""My dear Arkady, my heart was weakened and my spirit perturbed.

I'll tell you about one of the first impressions of that journey and of a dream I had then, I mean a real dream. It happened while I was still no further than Germany. I was about to leave Dresden, but in my absentmindedness at the railroad station I took the wrong train. The train stopped at about three in the afternoon at a station. I got off. It was a small German town. They recommended a hotel to me, since the train I was to take was not due until eleven o'clock at night. As it was a nice bright day and I was in no particular hurry to get anywhere, I felt pleased by that little adventure. I went wandering around the town and then went to the hotel, which was small and none too prepossessing but with plenty of trees and lots of flower beds all around, as the Germans always have. The room was small too. Having been up most of the previous night, I lay down on the bed and went to sleep at around four in the afternoon.","""Arkady dear, my soul was weary then, and I was troubled in spirit.

I will tell you about one of my first impressions, one of the dreams I had in those days, a real dream. It was when I was in Germany, I had only just left Dresden, and in absence of mind I passed the station at which I ought to have got out, and went off on to another line. I had to get out at once to change, it was between two and three in the afternoon, a fine day. It was a little German town: I was directed to an hotel. I had to wait; the next train was at eleven o'clock at night. I was quite glad of the adventure, for I was in no particular haste to get anywhere, and was simply wandering from place to place, my dear. The hotel turned out to be small and poor, but all surrounded by green trees and flower-beds, as is always the case in Germany. They gave me a tiny room, and as I had been travelling all night I fell asleep, after dinner, at four o'clock in the afternoon."

"Разумеется, я пренебрег отвечать. В ту минуту как раз вошла сестра, и я поскорее обратился к ней:","Of course, I neglected to answer. At that moment my sister came in, and I quickly turned to her:",Obviously I ignored her. At that moment my sister came in and I turned to her at once.,I need not say I did not deign to answer. At that moment my sister came in and I made haste to turn to her.
"Теперь приступлю к окончательной катастрофе, завершающей мои записки. Но чтоб продолжать дальше, я должен предварительно забежать вперед и объяснить нечто, о чем я совсем в то время не знал, когда действовал, но о чем узнал и что разъяснил себе вполне уже гораздо позже, то есть тогда, когда все уже кончилось. Иначе не сумею быть ясным, так как пришлось бы все писать загадками.

But in order to continue further, I must first run ahead and explain something about which I did not know at all at that time when I acted, but which I learned about and which I fully explained to myself much later, that is, when everything was already over. Otherwise I shall not be able to be clear, since I would have to write everything in riddles. And therefore I will make a direct and simple explanation, sacrificing the so-called artistry, and I will do it as if I were not writing, without the participation of my heart, but, as it were, entrefilet[88] in the newspapers.","Now I've come to the final catastrophe of my story. But first I must explain in advance certain facts of which I myself was not aware at the time, facts whose meaning I grasped fully only much later when everything was over.

So I'll start with a straightforward explanation, not bothering with artistic considerations, do it impersonally without any feelings or emotions, like a sort of newspaper report.","I am now approaching the culminating catastrophe to which my whole story is leading up. But before I can continue I must give a preliminary explanation of things of which I knew nothing at the time when I was taking part in them, but which I only understood and fully realized long afterwards, that is when everything was over. I don't know how else to be clear, as otherwise I should have to write the whole story in riddles. And so I will give a simple and direct explanation, sacrificing so-called artistic effect, and presenting it without any personal feelings, as though I were not writing it myself, something after the style of an entrefilet in the newspaper."

"Все это я таил с тех самых пор в моем сердце, а теперь пришло время и – я подвожу итог. Но опять-таки и в последний раз: я, может быть, на целую половину или даже на семьдесят пять процентов налгал на себя! В ту ночь я ненавидел ее, как исступленный, а потом как разбушевавшийся пьяный. Я сказал уже, что это был хаос чувств и ощущений, в котором я сам ничего разобрать не мог. Но, все равно, их надо было высказать, потому что хоть часть этих чувств да была же наверно.","All this I have been hiding in my heart since then, and now the time has come and - I sum up.

I have said already that it was a chaos of feelings and sensations in which I could distinguish nothing clearly myself.

As I learned later, Mrs. Prutkov had expounded that view to Versilov during a heated discussion the previous day.

"Но проснулся я наутро свежее и душевнее. Я даже упрекнул себя, невольно и сердечно, за некоторую легкость и как бы высокомерие, с которыми, как припоминалось мне, выслушивал вчера некоторые места его «исповеди». Если отчасти она была в беспорядке, если некоторые откровения были несколько как бы чадны и даже нескладны, то разве он готовился к ораторской речи, зазвав меня вчера к себе? Он только сделал мне великую честь, обратившись ко мне, как к единственному другу в такое мгновение, и этого я никогда ему не забуду. Напротив, его исповедь была «трогательна», как бы ни смеялись надо мной за это выражение, и если мелькало иногда циническое или даже что-то как будто смешное, то я был слишком широк, чтоб не понять и не допустить реализма – не марая, впрочем, идеала. Главное, я наконец постиг этого человека, и даже мне было отчасти жаль и как бы досадно, что все это оказалось так просто: этого человека я всегда ставил в сердце моем на чрезвычайную высоту, в облака, и непременно одевал его судьбу во что-то таинственное, так что естественно до сих пор желал, чтобы ларчик открывался похитрее. Впрочем, в встрече его с нею и в двухлетних страданиях его было много и сложного: «он не захотел фатума жизни; ему нужна была свобода, а не рабство фатума; через рабство фатума он принужден был оскорбить маму, которая просидела в Кенигсберге…» К тому же этого человека, во всяком случае, я считал проповедником: он носил в сердце золотой век и знал будущее об атеизме; и вот встреча с нею все надломила, все извратила! О, я ей не изменил, но все-таки я взял его сторону. Мама, например, рассуждал я, ничему бы не помешала в судьбе его, даже брак его с мамой. Это я понимал; это – совсем не то, что встреча с тою. Правда, мама все равно не дала бы ему спокойствия, но это даже тем бы и лучше: таких людей надо судить иначе, и пусть такова и будет их жизнь всегда; и это – вовсе не безобразие; напротив, безобразием было бы то, если б они успокоились или вообще стали бы похожими на всех средних людей. Похвалы его дворянству и слова его: «Je mourrai gentilhomme»[120] – нимало меня не смущали: я осмыслил, какой это был gentilhomme; это был тип, отдающий все и становящийся провозвестником всемирного гражданства и главной русской мысли «всесоединения идей». И хотя бы это все было даже и вздором, то есть «всесоединение идей» (что, конечно, немыслимо), то все-таки уж одно то хорошо, что он всю жизнь поклонялся идее, а не глупому золотому тельцу. Боже мой! Да замыслив мою «идею», я, я сам – разве я поклонился золотому тельцу, разве мне денег тогда надо было? Клянусь, мне надо было лишь идею! Клянусь, что ни одного стула, ни одного дивана не обил бы я себе бархатом и ел бы, имея сто миллионов, ту же тарелку супу с говядиной, как и теперь!","But I woke up the next morning fresher and more soulful. I even reproached myself, involuntarily and cordially, for a certain lightness and, as it were, arrogance, with which, as I recalled, I listened to some passages of his “confession” yesterday. If she was partly in disarray, if some revelations were somewhat vague and even incoherent, then was he really preparing for an oratorical speech, having called me to his place yesterday? He only did me the great honor of addressing me as his only friend at such a moment, and I will never forget that for him. On the contrary, his confession was “touching”, no matter how they laughed at me for this expression, and if sometimes a cynical or even something seemed to be funny flashed by, then I was too wide not to understand and not allow realism - not dirtying, however, the ideal. The main thing is that I finally comprehended this person, and even I was somewhat sorry and, as it were, annoyed that it all turned out to be so simple: I always placed this person in my heart at an extraordinary height, in the clouds, and without fail dressed his fate in something mysterious, so naturally still wished that the casket opened more cunningly. However, in his meeting with her and in his two years of suffering, there was much and difficult: “he did not want the fate of life; he needed freedom, not the slavery of fate; through the slavery of fate, he was forced to insult his mother, who sat in Konigsberg ... ”Besides, I considered this person, in any case, a preacher: he carried a golden age in his heart and knew the future about atheism; and now the meeting with her broke everything, perverted everything! Oh, I did not cheat on her, but still I took his side. Mom, for example, I reasoned, would not interfere with anything in his fate, even his marriage to his mother. This I understood; this is not at all like meeting with that one. True, his mother would not have given him peace anyway, but that would have been all the better: such people must be judged differently, and let their life always be like that; and this is not an outrage at all; on the contrary, it would be an outrage if they calmed down or even became like all average people. His praise of the nobility and his words: ""Je mourrai gentilhomme"" [120] - did not bother me in the least: I comprehended what kind of gentilhomme it was; he was a type who gave everything and became a herald of world citizenship and the main Russian idea of ""all-union of ideas."" And even though all this was even nonsense, that is, “the total union of ideas” (which, of course, is unthinkable), it is still good that he worshiped the idea all his life, and not the stupid golden calf. My God! Yes, having conceived my ""idea"", I, myself - did I bow to the golden calf, did I need money then? I swear I just wanted an idea! I swear that I would not upholster a single chair, not a single sofa, and eat, having a hundred million, the same bowl of soup with beef as now!","Still, I woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and cheered. I couldn't help reproaching myself a little for what seemed to me now the smugness and even condescension with which I'd listened the night before to certain passages of his ""confession. "" What if it had all sounded rather disconnected, at times even incoherent, and some of his ""revelations"" downright confused? Why shouldn't they, since he certainly hadn't prepared himself to deliver a smooth piece of oratory? Indeed, he had done me a great honor by confiding in me at such a moment as his only friend, and that is something I'll never forget. As a matter of fact, his confession had ""touched me"" (and let them laugh at me for using this sentimental expression) and, if there were overtones of cynicism or even sarcasm in it here and there, there was enough of that ""breadth"" in me to make me understand and accept his ""realism"" without it in the least detracting from his idealism. What was important is that I had finally gained insight into the man, although, paradoxically, I felt almost disappointed that it all turned out to be simple. In my esteem, Versilov dwelled high, beyond the clouds, and that communicated a mystery to everything touching him. So it was, after all, natural that I should find it a little disappointing that unwrapping the enigma had proved no harder than it had. From what I gathered, however, his relations with her and the two years of ordeal that had followed had had their share of complexity: he had refused to submit to the bondage of fate; what he'd wanted was not submission to his fate but freedom; it was this bondage to fate that had forced him to hurt my mother who had been waiting for him in Kbnigsberg. . . . Moreover, I saw in him a man with a message: he carried the Golden Age in his heart and he knew where atheism could lead. But the moment he'd met Katerina, everything in him had been shattered and distorted. Oh, it's not that I was betraying her, but I had to be on his side. Mother, for instance, I reasoned with myself, would not have interfered with his ""fate,"" nor for that matter would it have changed anything if he'd been married to Mother. That much I understood. But his meeting with her—that was something else. It's true that Mother would never have left him in peace either, or allowed him to be calm and contented, but that's as it should be, since people like him must be judged by different standards and they're destined to live differently from others. I'm not saying that their lives are bound to be disorderly and ugly; on the contrary, I feel it would be improper and ugly if they settled down and wound up resembling ordinary people. Versilov's high opinion of the social elite and his words ""je mourrai gentilhomme"" did not disconcert me in the least; I realized what sort of gentilhomme he considered himself to be—a man ready to give up everything to become the herald of universal citizenship and the disseminator of the Russian idea that ""unites the ideas of every nation."" And even if all that turned out to be utter nonsense (I mean the uniting of all national ideas, which appears quite unthinkable), even then I find it admirable that all his life he worshiped an idea rather than worshiping the stupid golden calf! And, thank God, when I myself conceived my idea, it was certainly not the worship of the golden calf, for it was obviously not really money that I was after! I swear, all I wanted was the idea! I swear that even if I had a hundred million rubles I would never have one single armchair or sofa upholstered with velvet and would eat the same meals of soup and beef as I do now!","At ten o'clock, just as I was getting ready to go out, to see him of course, Darya Onisimovna appeared. I asked her joyfully: ""whether she came from him?"" and heard with vexation that she did not come from him, but from Anna Andreyevna, and that she, Darya Onisimovna, ""had left the lodging as soon as it was light."""
"Спрашивать денег – прегадкая история, даже жалованье, если чувствуешь где-то в складках совести, что их не совсем заслужил. Между тем накануне мать, шепчась с сестрой, тихонько от Версилова («чтобы не огорчить Андрея Петровича»), намеревалась снести в заклад из киота образ, почему-то слишком ей дорогой. Служил я на пятидесяти рублях в месяц, но совсем не знал, как я буду их получать; определяя меня сюда, мне ничего не сказали. Дня три назад, встретившись внизу с чиновником, я осведомился у него: у кого здесь спрашивают жалованье? Тот посмотрел с улыбкой удивившегося человека (он меня не любил):","Asking for money is a nasty story, even a salary, if you feel somewhere in the folds of your conscience that you didn’t quite deserve it.

I served on fifty rubles a month, but did not know at all how I would receive them; when they sent me here, they didn't tell me anything. Three days ago, having met an official downstairs, I asked him: who is asked for a salary here? He looked with a smile of a surprised person (he did not love me):","Asking for money, even if it's a salary that's due you, is quite revolting under any circumstances, but it's even worse if, in the secret recesses of your conscience, you feel you haven't earned it. On the previous night, however, I'd heard my mother whispering to my sister, so Versilov wouldn't hear (""not to worry Andrei""), that she intended to take to the pawnshop an icon which, for some reason, was particularly dear to her. I was supposed to be earning fifty rubles a month but I didn't know when and how I was to be paid —no one had thought to inform me about that. Three days before, I had found the clerk in the downstairs office and had asked him where I should inquire about my salary. He looked at me, smiling with feigned surprise (he didn't like me).","To ask for money, even a salary, is a most disgusting business, especially if one feels in the recesses of one's conscience that one has not quite earned it. Yet the evening before, my mother had been whispering to my sister apart from Versilov (""so as not to worry Andrey Petrovitch"") that she intended to take the ikon which for some reason was particularly precious to her to the pawnbroker's. I was to be paid fifty roubles a month, but I had no idea how I should receive the money; nothing had been said to me about it. Meeting the clerk downstairs three days before, I inquired of him whom one was to ask for one's salary. He looked at me with a smile as though of astonishment (he did not like me)."
