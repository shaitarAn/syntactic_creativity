"«Если б и мне умирать, как Каю, то я так бы и знал это, так бы и говорил мне внутренний голос, но ничего подобного не было во мне; и я и все мои друзья — мы понимали, что это совсем не так, как с Каем.

How can one understand it?”","‘If I had to be like Caesar and die, I would have been aware of it, an inner voice would have told me, but there hasn’t been anything like that on the inside.

What’s it all about?’","“If I had to die like Caius I would have known it was so.

"Петр ушел. Иван Ильич, оставшись один, застонал не столько от боли, как она ни была ужасна, сколько от тоски. «Все то же и то же, все эти бесконечные дни и ночи. Хоть бы скорее. Что скорее? Смерть, мрак. Нет, нет. Все лучше смерти!»","Peter left.

"Петр Иванович знал, что как там надо было креститься, так здесь надо было пожать руку, вздохнуть и сказать: «Поверьте!». И он так и сделал.

"Вошел в толстых сапогах, распространяя вокруг себя приятный запах дегтя от сапог и свежести зимнего воздуха, легкой сильной поступью Герасим, в посконном чистом фартуке и чистой ситцевой рубахе, с засученными на голых, сильных, молодых руках рукавами, и, не глядя на Ивана Ильича, — очевидно, сдерживая, чтобы не оскорбить больного, радость жизни, сияющую на его лице, — подошел к судну.","Gerasim entered in thick boots, spreading around him a pleasant smell of tar from boots and the freshness of winter air, Gerasim with a light, strong step, in a clean apron and a clean cotton shirt, with sleeves rolled up on his bare, strong, young hands, and, not looking at Ivan Ilyich , - obviously, restraining, so as not to offend the patient, the joy of life shining on his face, - went up to the ship.","Gerasim came in with firm, light steps in his heavy boots, giving off a pleasant smell of tar from the boots and of fresh winter air; he had on a clean hessian apron and a clean cotton shirt , the sleeves rolled up over his strong, young, bare arms; without looking at Ivan Ilyich, he went to the vessel, obviously masking the joy in living shining out from his face so as not to hurt the sick man.","Who should come in but Gerasim, wearing his thick boots and exuding both their nice tarry smell and that of the fresh winter air, Gerasim with his light but firm tread, sporting a clean hessian apron and a clean cotton shirt, with his sleeves rolled up his bare strong young arms, and without a glance at Ivan Ilyich - to spare the sick man’s feelings he was clearly suppressing the joyful vitality that shone from his face - he walked over to the pot.","Gerasim with a firm light tread, his heavy boots emitting a pleasant smell of tar and fresh winter air, came in wearing a clean Hessian apron, the sleeves of his print shirt tucked up over his strong bare young arms; and refraining from looking at his sick master out of consideration for his feelings, and restraining the joy of life that beamed from his face, he went up to the commode."

Обе замолчали, посидели и вышли.","She wanted to leave, but at that time her daughter came in and came up to say hello.

"Петр Иванович вздохнул еще глубже и печальнее, и Прасковья Федоровна благодарно пожала ему руку. Войдя в ее обитую розовым кретоном гостиную с пасмурной лампой, они сели у стола: она на диван, а Петр Иванович на расстроившийся пружинами и неправильно подававшийся под его сиденьем низенький пуф. Прасковья Федоровна хотела предупредить его, чтобы он сел на другой стул, но нашла это предупреждение не соответствующим своему положению и раздумала. Садясь на этот пуф, Петр Иванович вспомнил, как Иван Ильич устраивал эту гостиную и советовался с ним об этом самом розовом с зелеными листьями кретоне. Садясь на диван и проходя мимо стола (вообще вся гостиная была полна вещиц и мебели), вдова зацепилась черным кружевом черной мантилий за резьбу стола. Петр Иванович приподнялся, чтобы отцепить, и освобожденный под ним пуф стал волноваться и подталкивать его. Вдова сама стала отцеплять свое кружево, и Петр Иванович опять сел, придавив бунтовавшийся под ним пуф. Но вдова не все отцепила, и Петр Иванович опять поднялся, и опять пуф забунтовал и даже щелкнул. Когда все это кончилось, она вынула чистый батистовый платок и стала плакать. Петра же Ивановича охладил эпизод с кружевом и борьба с пуфом, и он сидел насупившись. Неловкое это положение перервал Соколов, буфетчик Ивана Ильича, с докладом о том, что место на кладбище то, которое назначила Прасковья Федоровна, будет стоить двести рублей. Она перестала плакать и, с видом жертвы взглянув на Петра Ивановича, сказала по-французски, что ей очень тяжело. Петр Иванович сделал молчаливый знак, выражавший несомненную уверенность в том, что это не может быть иначе.","Pyotr Ivanovich sighed even more deeply and sadder, and Praskovya Fyodorovna shook hands with him gratefully. Entering her living room, upholstered in pink cretonne with a cloudy lamp, they sat down at the table: she on the sofa, and Pyotr Ivanovich on the low pouffe, which was upset by the springs and which was incorrectly fed under his seat. Praskovya Fyodorovna wanted to warn him to sit in another chair, but found this warning inappropriate for her position and changed her mind. Sitting down on this pouffe, Pyotr Ivanovich remembered how Ivan Ilyich arranged this drawing room and consulted with him about this very pink cretonne with green leaves. Sitting down on the sofa and passing by the table (in general, the whole living room was full of gizmos and furniture), the widow caught the black lace of her black mantle on the carving of the table. Pyotr Ivanovich got up to unhook it, and the pouffe freed under him began to stir and push it. The widow herself began to unhook her lace, and Pyotr Ivanovich sat down again, pressing down on the pouffe that rebelled under it. But the widow did not unhook everything, and Pyotr Ivanovich got up again, and again the pouffe rebelled and even clicked. When it was all over, she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to cry. But Pyotr Ivanovich was cooled by the episode with the lace and the struggle with the pouffe, and he sat frowning. This awkward situation was interrupted by Sokolov, Ivan Ilyich's barman, with a report that the place in the cemetery that Praskovya Fyodorovna had appointed would cost two hundred rubles. She stopped crying and, looking at Pyotr Ivanovich with the air of a victim, said in French that it was very hard for her. Pyotr Ivanovich made a silent sign expressing the undoubted conviction that it could not be otherwise.","Pyotr Ivanovich sighed even more deeply and sadly, and Praskovya Fyodorovna gratefully pressed his hand. They went into her dimly lit drawing room hung with pink cretonne and sat down by a table, she on a sofa and Pyotr Ivanovich on a low pouf built on springs that awkwardly gave way as he sat down. (Praskovya Fyodorovna was going to warn him to sit on another chair but found such a warning inappropriate for the situation and changed her mind.) As he sat down on the pouf, Pyotr Ivanovich remembered how Ivan Ilyich had arranged this drawing room and consulted him about this very pink cretonne with green leaves. On her way to sit down on the sofa, as she passed the table (the whole drawing room was full of furniture and knickknacks), the widow caught the lace of her black mantilla on the carving of the table. Pyotr Ivanovich got up to unhook her, and the sprung pouf now released below began to sway and push at him. The widow started to unhook the lace herself and Pyotr Ivanovich sat down again, quelling the rebellious pouf underneath him. But the widow hadn’t unhooked it all, and Pyotr Ivanovich again got up and the pouf again rebelled and even made a noise. When all this was over she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to cry. Pyotr Ivanovich felt chilled by the episode of the lace and the battle with the pouf and sat frowning. This awkward situation was interrupted by Sokolov, Ivan Ilyich’s butler, reporting that the place in the cemetery Praskovya Fyodorovna had selected would cost two hundred rubles. She stopped crying and, looking at Pyotr Ivanovich with the air of a victim, said in French that she was suffering greatly. Pyotr Ivanovich made a silent sign expressing a firm conviction that it couldn’t be otherwise.","Pyotr Ivanovich sighed even more deeply and plaintively, and Praskovya showed her gratitude by squeezing his hand. Proceeding into her drawing-room, which was done out in pink cretonne and lit by one dismal lamp, they sat down near to a table, she on a sofa, he on a low pouffe with broken springs that wobbled unevenly as he sat on it. Praskovya had wanted to warn him off into another chair, but a warning like that did not seem appropriate in the circumstances, so she thought better of it. As he sat down on his pouffe, Pyotr Ivanovich remembered the time when Ivan Ilyich had been decorating this room and had asked his advice about this pink cretonne with the green leaves. On her way past the table to sit down on the sofa — the room was crammed with furniture and knick-knacks - Praskovya snagged the black lace of her black shawl on the carved edge of the table. Pyotr Ivanovich rose slightly to disentangle it, thus releasing the pouffe, which quivered and pushed up at him. The widow began disentangling the lace herself, so Pyotr Ivanovich sat down again, crushing the rebellious pouffe back into submission. But the widow had not finished disentangling herself, so Pyotr Ivanovich rose again, and so did the pouffe, rebellious and even creaking. When this was all over, she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and burst into tears. But Pyotr Ivanovich had cooled somewhat after the episode with the lace and the battle with the pouffe, and he sat there with a scowl on his face. The embarrassment was broken when Sokolov, Ivan Ilyich’s footman, came in to report that the plot which Praskovya had chosen in the cemetery was going to cost two hundred roubles. She had stopped weeping, and she looked at Pyotr Ivanovich with a victimized air as she told him in French how hard things were for her. Pyotr Ivanovich made a silent gesture to acknowledge his absolute conviction that it could not be otherwise.","Peter Ivanovich sighed still more deeply and despondently, and Praskovya Fedorovna pressed his arm gratefully. When they reached the drawing-room, upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp, they sat down at the table — she on a sofa and Peter Ivanovich on a low pouffe, the springs of which yielded spasmodically under his weight. Praskovya Fedorovna had been on the point of warning him to take another seat, but felt that such a warning was out of keeping with her present condition and so changed her mind. As he sat down on the pouffe Peter Ivanovich recalled how Ivan Ilych had arranged this room and had consulted him regarding this pink cretonne with green leaves. The whole room was full of furniture and knick-knacks, and on her way to the sofa the lace of the widow’s black shawl caught on the edge of the table. Peter Ivanovich rose to detach it, and the springs of the pouffe, relieved of his weight, rose also and gave him a push. The widow began detaching her shawl herself, and Peter Ivanovich again sat down, suppressing the rebellious springs of the pouffe under him. But the widow had not quite freed herself and Peter Ivanovich got up again, and again the pouffe rebelled and even creaked. When this was all over she took out a clean cambric handkerchief and began to weep. The episode with the shawl and the struggle with the pouffe had cooled Peter Ivanovich’s emotions and he sat there with a sullen look on his face. This awkward situation was interrupted by Sokolov, Ivan Ilych’s butler, who came to report that the plot in the cemetery that Praskovya Fedorovna had chosen would cost two hundred rubles. She stopped weeping and, looking at Peter Ivanovich with the air of a victim, remarked in French that it was very hard for her. Peter Ivanovich made a silent gesture signifying his full conviction that it must indeed be so."
"— Да, — прошептала она, — до последней минуты. Он простился с нами за четверть часа до смерти и еще просил увести Володю.","“Yes,” she whispered, “until the last minute. He said goodbye to us a quarter of an hour before his death and also asked to take Volodya away.","“Yes,” she whispered, “till the final moment. He said goodbye to us a quarter of an hour before he died and asked as well for Volodya to be taken out.”","‘Yes,’ she whispered. ‘To the very end. He said goodbye a quarter of an hour before he died, and he was still asking us to take Volodya away.’","“Yes,” she whispered. “To the last moment. He took leave of us a quarter of an hour before he died, and asked us to take Volodya away.”"
"— Уведи… жалко… и тебя… — Он хотел сказать еще «прости», но сказал «пропусти», и, не в силах уже будучи поправиться, махнул рукою, зная, что поймет тот, кому надо.","“Take away… it’s a pity… and you…” He wanted to say “I’m sorry” again, but he said “Skip it”, and, unable to recover, he waved his hand, knowing that the one who needed it would understand.","He wanted to add “forgive” but said “give,” and not having the strength to correct himself, waved his hand, knowing that He who needed to understand would understand.","He tried to say, ‘Forgive me,’ but it came out as, ‘For goodness ...’ Too weak to correct himself, he waved his hand knowing that he who needed to would understand.","He tried to add, “Forgive me,” but said “Forego” and waved his hand, knowing that He whose understanding mattered would understand."
"Так прошло две недели. В эти недели случилось желанное для Ивана Ильича и его жены событие: Петрищев сделал формальное предложение. Это случилось вечером.

"Во взгляде на круг своих знакомых муж, жена и дочь были совершенно согласны и, не сговариваясь, одинаково оттирали от себя и освобождались от всяких разных приятелей и родственников, замарашек, которые разлетались к ним с нежностями в гостиную с японскими блюдами по стенам. Скоро эти друзья-замарашки перестали разлетаться, и у Головиных осталось общество одно самое лучшее. Молодые люди ухаживали за Лизанькой, и Петрищев, сын Дмитрия Ивановича Петрищева и единственный наследник его состояния, судебный следователь, стал ухаживать за Лизой, так что Иван Ильич уже поговаривал об этом с Прасковьей Федоровной: не свести ли их кататься на тройках или устроить спектакль. Так они жили. И все шло так, не изменяясь, и все было очень хорошо.","In looking at the circle of their acquaintances, the husband, wife and daughter were in complete agreement and, without saying a word, they equally wiped themselves off and freed themselves from all sorts of friends and relatives, smut, who flew to them with tenderness into the living room with Japanese dishes on the walls. Soon these sleazy friends ceased to scatter, and the Golovins were left with only the best company. Young people courted Lizanka, and Petrishchev, the son of Dmitri Ivanovich Petrishchev and the only heir to his fortune, a judicial investigator, began to court Liza, so that Ivan Ilyich had already talked about this with Praskovya Fyodorovna: whether to take them to ride in troikas or arrange a performance. This is how they lived. And everything went on like this, without changing, and everything was very good.","Husband, wife, and daughter were agreed in their views of their circle of acquaintances, and without any formal understanding they dropped and were rid of all sorts of shabby little friends and relatives who used to drop in to see them, spouting endearments into the drawing room with Japanese plates hanging on the wall.

Young men paid court to Lizanka and Petrishchev, an examining magistrate, the son of Dmitry Ivanovich Petrishchev17 and sole heir to his property, began to pay so much attention to her that Ivan Ilyich even talked about it to Praskovya Fyodorovna. Shouldn’t they bring them together in a troika ride or organize some theatricals? That’s how they lived. And everything went on like that, without any change, and everything was very good.","In their attitude towards the circle of their acquaintances husband, wife and daughter were of one mind. Without collusion, each of them in the same way shrugged off and discarded all the shabby friends and relatives who flocked around fawning on them in the drawing-room with the Japanese plates on the walls. It wasn’t long before the shabby friends stopped flocking around and left the Golovin family to the best people in society and no one else. Young men were attracted to their little Liza and one examining magistrate by the name of Petrishchev, the son of Dmitriy Ivanovich Petrishchev and his sole heir, became so attentive towards her that Ivan Ilyich mentioned this once or twice to Praskovya and wondered whether they ought perhaps to take them out for a ride in a troika or set up some private theatricals. This was how they lived. This was how things went, nothing changed, and everything was fine.","In their views as to their acquaintances, husband, wife and daughter were entirely agreed, and tacitly and unanimously kept at arm’s length and shook off the various shabby friends and relations who, with much show of affection, gushed into the drawing-room with its Japanese plates on the walls.

So they lived, and all went well, without change, and life flowed pleasantly."

"Ивана Ильича ценили как хорошего служаку, и через три года сделали товарищем прокурора.

"И, спасаясь от этого состояния, Иван Ильич искал утешения, других ширм, и другие ширмы являлись и на короткое время как будто спасали его, но тотчас же опять не столько разрушались, сколько просвечивали, как будто она проникала через все, и ничто не могло заслонить ее.","And, fleeing from this state, Ivan Ilyich sought consolation, other screens, and other screens appeared and for a short time seemed to save him, but immediately again, not so much destroyed, as translucent, as if she penetrated everything, and nothing could shield her.","And to rescue himself from this condition, Ivan Ilyich looked for relief—for new screens—and new screens appeared and for a short time seemed to offer him salvation, but very soon they again not so much collapsed as let the light through, as if It penetrated everything and nothing could hide it.","And in order to escape from this situation Ivan Ilyich sought other forms of consolation, other ways of screening it off; other screens appeared and for a while they seemed to be the saving of him, but immediately they were not so much destroyed as shone right through; it was as if It could penetrate anything, no defence being any good.","And to save himself from this condition Ivan Ilych looked for consolations — new screens — and new screens were found and for a while seemed to save him, but then they immediately fell to pieces or rather became transparent, as if It penetrated them and nothing could veil It."

"Петр Иванович вошел, как всегда это бывает, с недоумением о том, что ему там надо будет делать. Одно он знал, что креститься в этих случаях никогда не мешает. Насчет того, что нужно ли при этом и кланяться, он не совсем был уверен и потому выбрал среднее: войдя в комнату, он стал креститься и немножко как будто кланяться. Насколько ему позволяли движения рук и головы, он вместе с тем оглядывал комнату. Два молодые человека, один гимназист, кажется, племянники, крестясь, выходили из комнаты. Старушка стояла неподвижно. И дама с странно поднятыми бровями что-то ей говорила шепотом. Дьячок в сюртуке, бодрый, решительный, читал что-то громко с выражением, исключающим всякое противоречие; буфетный мужик Герасим, пройдя перед Петром Ивановичем легкими шагами, что-то посыпал по полу. Увидав это, Петр Иванович тотчас же почувствовал легкий запах разлагающегося трупа. В последнее свое посещение Ивана Ильича Петр Иванович видел этого мужика в кабинете; он исполнял должность сиделки, и Иван Ильич особенно любил его. Петр Иванович все крестился и слегка кланялся по серединному направлению между гробом, дьячком и образами на столе в углу. Потом, когда это движение крещения рукою показалось ему уже слишком продолжительно, он приостановился и стал разглядывать мертвеца.","Pyotr Ivanovich entered, as he always does, perplexed as to what he would have to do there. One thing he knew was that in these cases it never interferes with being baptized. As to whether it was necessary to bow at the same time, he was not entirely sure and therefore chose the middle one: entering the room, he began to cross himself and bow a little, as it were. As far as the movements of his arms and head allowed him, he at the same time looked around the room. Two young men, one high school student, nephews, I think, were crossing themselves out of the room. The old woman stood motionless. And the lady with strangely raised eyebrows said something to her in a whisper. The deacon in a frock coat, cheerful, resolute, was reading something aloud with an expression that excludes any contradiction; the pantry peasant Gerasim, passing in front of Pyotr Ivanovich with light steps, was scattering something on the floor. Seeing this, Pyotr Ivanovich immediately felt the slight smell of a decaying corpse. On his last visit to Ivan Ilyich, Pyotr Ivanovich saw this peasant in his study; he acted as a nurse, and Ivan Ilyich especially loved him. Pyotr Ivanovich kept crossing himself and bowing slightly in the middle direction between the coffin, the deacon, and the icons on the table in the corner. Then, when this gesture of baptism with his hand seemed to him already too long, he stopped and began to look at the dead man.","Pyotr Ivanovich went in, feeling, as is always the case, at a loss as to what he should do there. One thing he did know was that in these circumstances it never does any harm to cross oneself. He wasn’t altogether sure whether one should also bow and so he chose a middle course: entering the room, he started to cross himself and made a kind of slight bow. Insofar as the movements of his head and hands would allow, he looked round the room at the same time. Two young men, probably nephews, one of them a gymnasium pupil, were crossing themselves as they left the room. An old woman stood motionless, and a lady with oddly arched eyebrows was saying something to her in a whisper. A church lector in a frock coat with a vigorous and decisive way to him was reading something out loudly with an expression that permitted no contradiction; the peasant manservant Gerasim, stepping lightly in front of Pyotr Ivanovich, scattered something on the ground. Seeing that, Pyotr Ivanovich at once sensed the faint smell of a decomposing body. On his last visit to Ivan Ilyich he had seen this peasant in the study; he carried out the duties of a sick-nurse, and Ivan Ilyich was especially fond of him. Pyotr Ivanovich kept crossing himself and bowing slightly in an intermediate direction between the coffin, the lector, and the icons on a table in the corner. Then, when he thought the movement of crossing himself with his hand had gone on for too long, he stopped and started to examine the dead man.","Pyotr Ivanovich entered the room, and hesitated, as people always do on these occasions, not knowing precisely what to do. The only thing he was certain of was that in this situation you couldn’t go wrong if you made the sign of the cross. Whether or not you should bow at the same time he wasn’t sure, so he went for a compromise, crossing himself as he walked in and giving a bit of a bow as he did so. At the same time, as far as hand and head movements permitted, he glanced round the room. Two young persons, nephews apparently, one of them a schoolboy, were crossing themselves as they left the room. A little old woman was standing there motionless. And a lady with curiously arched eyebrows was whispering to her. A church reader in a frock-coat - a hearty character of considerable spirit — was reading something out in a loud voice and a tone that brooked no contradiction. Gerasim, the peasant who waited at table, darted ahead of Pyotr Ivanovich, sprinkling something on the floor. Seeing this, Pyotr Ivanovich instantly recognized a slight smell of decaying flesh. When he had visited Ivan Ilyich for the last time he had seen this peasant in Ivan Ilyich’s room, acting as a sick nurse, and Ivan Ilyich had had a special fondness for him. Pyotr Ivanovich kept on crossing himself, and aimed a slight bow midway between the reader, the coffin and the icons on the corner table. Then, when the business of crossing himself seemed to be going on too long, he paused and took a close look at the dead man.","Peter Ivanovich, like everyone else on such occasions, entered feeling uncertain what he would have to do. All he knew was that at such times it is always safe to cross oneself. But he was not quite sure whether one should make obseisances while doing so. He therefore adopted a middle course. On entering the room he began crossing himself and made a slight movement resembling a bow. At the same time, as far as the motion of his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the room. Two young men — apparently nephews, one of whom was a high-school pupil — were leaving the room, crossing themselves as they did so. An old woman was standing motionless, and a lady with strangely arched eyebrows was saying something to her in a whisper. A vigorous, resolute Church Reader, in a frock-coat, was reading something in a loud voice with an expression that precluded any contradiction. The butler’s assistant, Gerasim, stepping lightly in front of Peter Ivanovich, was strewing something on the floor. Noticing this, Peter Ivanovich was immediately aware of a faint odour of a decomposing body. The last time he had called on Ivan Ilych, Peter Ivanovich had seen Gerasim in the study. Ivan Ilych had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the duty of a sick nurse. Peter Ivanovich continued to make the sign of the cross slightly inclining his head in an intermediate direction between the coffin, the Reader, and the icons on the table in a corner of the room. Afterwards, when it seemed to him that this movement of his arm in crossing himself had gone on too long, he stopped and began to look at the corpse."
"Когда она вернулась, он так же лежал навзничь, глядя вверх.","When she returned, he was also lying on his back, looking up.","When she returned, he was lying in the same position, on his back, looking up.","When she came back he was still lying there on his back, staring upwards.","When she came back he still lay on his back, looking upwards."
"— Божья воля. Все там же будем, — сказал Герасим, оскаливая свои белые, сплошные мужицкие зубы, и, как человек в разгаре усиленной работы, живо отворил дверь, кликнул кучера, подсадил Петра Ивановича и прыгнул назад к крыльцу, как будто придумывая, что бы ему еще сделать.","- God's will. We’ll all be right there,” said Gerasim, baring his white, solid peasant teeth, and, like a man in the midst of intense work, he quickly opened the door, called the coachman, helped Pyotr Ivanovich up and jumped back to the porch, as if thinking of something else to do. do.","“It’s God’s will. We’ll all be there,” said Gerasim, showing his white, regular, peasant’s teeth, and like a man in the full swing of intensive work, briskly opened the door, called the coachman, helped Pyotr Ivanovich in, and jumped back to the steps as if trying to think what else he might do.","“Tis God’s will, sir. ‘ Twill come to us all,’ said Gerasim, displaying an even white row of peasant’s teeth, and then, with the air of a man with a lot of work to do, he wrenched the door open, called the driver up and sprang back to the porch steps, wondering what else needed to be done.","“It’s God’s will. We shall all come to it some day,” said Gerasim, displaying his teeth — the even white teeth of a healthy peasant — and, like a man in the thick of urgent work, he briskly opened the front door, called the coachman, helped Peter Ivanovich into the sledge, and sprang back to the porch as if in readiness for what he had to do next. Peter Ivanovich found the fresh air particularly pleasant after the smell of incense, the dead body, and carbolic acid."
"— Прекрасно, очень хорошо, — проговорил он.","“Very well, very well,” he said.","“Fine, very well,” he said.","‘All right. That’s fine,’ he said.","“All right. Very well,” he muttered."

"Ее одежда, ее сложение, выражение ее лица, звук ее голоса — все сказало ему одно: «Не то. Все то, чем ты жил и живешь, — есть ложь, обман, скрывающий от тебя жизнь и смерть». И как только он подумал это, поднялась его ненависть и вместе с ненавистью физические мучительные страдания и с страданиями сознание неизбежной, близкой погибели. Что-то сделалось новое: стало винтить, и стрелять, и сдавливать дыхание.","Her clothes, her build, the expression on her face, the sound of her voice, all told him one thing: “Not that.

"С самого начала болезни, с того времени, как Иван Ильич в первый раз поехал к доктору, его жизнь разделилась на два противоположные настроения, сменившие одно другое: то было отчаяние и ожидание непонятной и ужасной смерти, то была надежда и исполненное интереса наблюдение за деятельностью своего тела. То перед глазами была одна почка или кишка, которая на время отклонилась от исполнения своих обязанностей, то была одна непонятная ужасная смерть, от которой ничем нельзя избавиться.","From the very beginning of his illness, from the time Ivan Ilyich went to the doctor for the first time, his life was divided into two opposite moods, which replaced one another: one was despair and the expectation of an incomprehensible and terrible death, the other was hope and an interest-filled observation of the activity of your body. Either before my eyes there was one kidney or intestine, which for a while deviated from the performance of its duties, then there was one incomprehensible terrible death, from which nothing can be got rid of.","From the very start of his illness, when Ivan Ilyich went to the doctor for the first time, his life was divided into two diametrically opposed moods, which alternated with each other: on the one hand despair and the expectation of an incomprehensible and horrible death, on the other hope and the absorbed observation of the activity of his body. Now he had before his eyes just a kidney or appendix which for a time had deviated from the performance of its duties; now there was just incomprehensible, horrible death from which it was impossible to escape in any way.","From the very onset of his illness, since the first time he had driven round to see the doctor, his life had divided itself into two opposite and alternating moods: either despair and the anticipation of a horribly incomprehensible death, or hope accompanied by an obsessive fascination for the workings of his body. He had eyes for only two things: either a kidney or blind gut that had temporarily stopped doing what it should do, or a horribly incomprehensible death, which there was no way to avoid.","From the very beginning of his illness, ever since he had first been to see the doctor, Ivan Ilych’s life had been divided between two contrary and alternating moods: now it was despair and the expectation of this uncomprehended and terrible death, and now hope and an intently interested observation of the functioning of his organs.

"В последнее время того одиночества, в котором он находился, лежа лицом к спинке дивана, того одиночества среди многолюдного города и своих многочисленных знакомых и семьи, — одиночества, полнее которого не могло быть нигде: ни на дне моря, ни в земле, — последнее время этого страшного одиночества Иван Ильич жил только воображением в прошедшем. Одна за другой ему представлялись картины его прошедшего. Начиналось всегда с ближайшего по времени и сводилось к самому отдаленному, к детству, и на нем останавливалось. Вспоминал ли Иван Ильич о вареном черносливе, который ему предлагали есть нынче, он вспоминал о сыром сморщенном французском черносливе в детстве, об особенном вкусе его и обилии слюны, когда дело доходило до косточки, и рядом с этим воспоминанием вкуса возникал целый ряд воспоминаний того времени: няня, брат, игрушки. «Не надо об этом… слишком больно», — говорил себе Иван Ильич и опять переносился в настоящее. Пуговица на спинке дивана и морщины сафьяна. «Сафьян дорог, непрочен; ссора была из-за него. Но сафьян другой был, и другая ссора, когда мы разорвали портфель у отца и нас наказали, а мама принесла пирожки». И опять останавливалось на детстве, и опять Ивану Ильичу было больно, и он старался отогнать и думать о другом.","Lately, that loneliness in which he was lying facing the back of the sofa, that loneliness in the midst of a crowded city and his numerous acquaintances and family - a loneliness that could not be more complete anywhere: neither at the bottom of the sea, nor in the earth - the last during this terrible loneliness, Ivan Ilyich lived only in imagination in the past. One by one, he presented pictures of his past. It always began with the nearest in time and reduced to the most distant, to childhood, and stopped there. Did Ivan Ilyich remember the boiled prunes that he was offered to eat today, did he remember the raw, shriveled French prunes in childhood, about its special taste and abundance of saliva when it came to the stone, and next to this memory of taste a whole series of memories of that time arose : nanny, brother, toys. ""Don't talk about it ... it hurts too much,"" Ivan Ilyich said to himself, and was again transported to the present. A button on the back of the sofa and wrinkles in morocco. “Morocco is expensive, fragile; the fight was about him. But the morocco was different, and another quarrel, when we tore the briefcase from my father and we were punished, and my mother brought pies. And again it stopped at childhood, and again Ivan Ilyich was in pain, and he tried to drive away and think about something else.","In the recent loneliness in which he found himself, lying with his face to the back of the sofa, loneliness in the midst of a crowded city and his numerous acquaintances and family—loneliness that could not be more absolute anywhere, either at the bottom of the sea or underneath the earth—in his recent terrible loneliness Ivan Ilyich lived only by his imagination in the past. One after another pictures of his past presented themselves to him. It always began with the closest in time and went back to the most remote, to his childhood, and rested there. If Ivan Ilyich thought of the stewed prunes he was offered to eat now, he remembered the moist, wrinkled French prunes of his childhood, their particular taste and the flow of saliva when he got to the stone, and alongside this memory of taste there arose a whole row of memories of that time: his nyanya, his brother, his toys. “You mustn’t think of that. . . . It’s too painful,” Ivan Ilyich said to himself, and was again transported into the present. A button on the back of the sofa and the creases in its morocco leather. “Morocco is expensive and wears badly; there was a quarrel because of it. But it was different leather and a different row when we ripped our father’s briefcase and were punished, but Mama brought us some pies.” And again he stopped in his childhood and again it was painful for Ivan Ilyich, and he tried to push it away and think of something else.","In his last days of solitude, when he found himself lying there facing the back of the sofa, solitude in the midst of a populous city and his own friends and family — a solitude more complete than anything anywhere, at the bottom of the sea or in the bowels of the earth - in these last days of terrible solitude Ivan Ilyich lived only by recreating the past. Images of his past life came back to him one after another. This process always began with the most recent ones and proceeded back to the most remote, to childhood, and there it lingered. If Ivan Ilyich remembered the stewed prunes he had been offered for dinner that day he would remember the raw and wrinkly French prunes of his childhood, their special taste and how his mouth watered when he got down to the stone, and along with the memory of that taste would come a whole series of further memories of that time: his nurse, his brother, his toys. ‘ No, don’t, not that. It’s too painful,’ Ivan Ilyich would say to himself, transporting himself back to the present: there it was - a button of the back of the sofa, creases in the morocco. ‘Morocco is expensive, and it doesn’t wear well. It started an argument. But that was different morocco and a different argument - when we tore father’s briefcase and got punished, and mother brought us some tarts.’ Once again his thoughts were settling on his childhood, and again they were too painful for Ivan Ilyich , so he tried to drive them away and think of something else.","Latterly during the loneliness in which he found himself as he lay facing the back of the sofa, a loneliness in the midst of a populous town and surrounded by numerous acquaintances and relations but that yet could not have been more complete anywhere — either at the bottom of the sea or under the earth — during that terrible loneliness Ivan ilych had lived only in memories of the past. Pictures of his past rose before him one after another. they always began with what was nearest in time and then went back to what was most remote — to his childhood — and rested there. If he thought of the stewed prunes that had been offered him that day, his mind went back to the raw shrivelled French plums of his childhood, their peculiar flavour and the flow of saliva when he sucked their stones, and along with the memory of that taste came a whole series of memories of those days: his nurse, his brother, and their toys. “No, I mustn’t thing of that... It is too painful,” Ivan Ilych said to himself, and brought himself back to the present — to the button on the back of the sofa and the creases in its morocco. “Morocco is expensive, but it does not wear well: there had been a quarrel about it. It was a different kind of quarrel and a different kind of morocco that time when we tore father’s portfolio and were punished, and mamma brought us some tarts ...” And again his thoughts dwelt on his childhood, and again it was painful and he tried to banish them and fix his mind on something else."
"Очень скоро, не далее как через год после женитьбы, Иван Ильич понял, что супружеская жизнь, представляя некоторые удобства в жизни, в сущности есть очень сложное и тяжелое дело, по отношению которого, для того чтобы исполнять свой долг, то есть вести приличную, одобряемую обществом жизнь, нужно выработать определенное отношение, как и к службе.","Very soon, not more than a year after his marriage, Ivan Ilyich realized that married life, while presenting some conveniences in life, is in essence a very complex and difficult matter, in relation to which, in order to fulfill one's duty, that is, to lead a decent, approved by society, you need to develop a certain attitude, as well as to the service.","Very soon, not more than a year after their marriage, Ivan Ilyich understood that married life, which offers certain conveniences, in reality is a very complicated and difficult business with which, in order to do one’s duty—that is, to lead a decorous life that is approved of by society—one has to develop a defined relationship as one does with one’s work.","It didn’t take him long — no more than a year after his wedding-to realize that although married life did provide some conveniences, it was actually rather a complex and difficult business, and the path of duty, which meant leading a decent life approved of by society, called for a clearly defined attitude, as at work.","Very soon, within a year of his wedding, Ivan Ilych had realized that marriage, though it may add some comforts to life, is in fact a very intricate and difficult affair towards which in order to perform one’s duty, that is, to lead a decorous life approved of by society, one must adopt a definite attitude just as towards one’s official duties."

"Герасим подошел; сильными руками, так же, как он легко ступал, обнял, ловко, мягко поднял и подержал, другой рукой подтянул панталоны и хотел посадить. Но Иван Ильич попросил его свести его на диван. Герасим, без усилия и как будто не нажимая, свел его, почти неся, к дивану и посадил.","Gerasim came up; with strong hands, just as he lightly stepped, embraced, deftly, gently lifted and held, with the other hand he pulled up his pantaloons and wanted to plant. But Ivan Ilyich asked him to take him to the sofa. Gerasim, without effort and as if without pressing, led him, almost carrying him, to the sofa and sat him down.","Gerasim came over to him; he put his strong arms around him and, gently and deftly, the same way he walked, lifted and supported him; he pulled up his trousers with one hand and was going to sit him down.

In one movement that was as easy as his way of walking, he put his strong arms gently round Ivan Ilyich, lifted him up and held him with one hand, pulled up his trousers with the other, and tried to settle him down.

Effortlesly and apparently without tightening his grip, Gerasim took him, almost carried him, to the sofa and settled him down there.","Gerasim went up to him, grasped his master with his strong arms deftly but gently, in the same way that he stepped — lifted him, supported him with one hand, and with the other drew up his trousers and would have set him down again, but Ivan Ilych asked to be led to the sofa. Gerasim, without an effort and without apparent pressure, led him, almost lifting him, to the sofa and placed him on it."
"Он шел в кабинет, ложился и оставался опять один с нею, с глазу на глаз с нею, а делать с нею нечего. Только смотреть на нее и холодеть.","He went into the study, went to bed, and again remained alone with her, face to face with her, but there was nothing to do with her.

Only stare at It and go cold.","He would go to his study, lie down, and again be alone with It : face to face with It. And nothing could be done with It except to look at it and shudder."
"Он услыхал эти слова и повторил их в своей душе. «Кончена смерть, — сказал он себе. — Ее нет больше».","He heard these words and repeated them in his soul. Death is over, he told himself. “She is no more.”","He heard these words and repeated them in his heart. “Death is finished,” he said to himself. “It is no more.”","He caught these words and repeated them in spirit. ‘Death has gone,’ he told himself. ‘It’s gone.’","He heard these words and repeated them in his soul. “Death is finished,” he said to himself. “It is no more!”"

"Проведя бессонную ночь, которую всю Иван Ильич проходил по террасе, он решил ехать в Петербург хлопотать и, чтобы наказать их, тех, которые не умели оценить его, перейти в другое министерство.","After spending a sleepless night, which Ivan Ilyich spent the whole time walking on the terrace, he decided to go to St. Petersburg to work hard and, in order to punish them, those who did not know how to appreciate him, go to another ministry.","Having spent a sleepless night pacing the terrace, Ivan Ilyich decided to go to Petersburg to make a petition and, in order to punish them, those who could not appreciate him, to transfer to another ministry.","During a sleepless night, the whole of which he spent pacing the terrace, he decided he would go to Petersburg and make representations; he would get his own back on those men who had underestimated him, by changing ministries.","Having passed a sleepless night pacing up and down the veranda, he decided to go to Petersburg and bestir himself, in order to punish those who had failed to appreciate him and to get transferred to another ministry."

"Она стала говорить о лекарствах. Он перевел свой взгляд на нее. Она не договорила того, что начала: такая злоба, именно к ней, выражалась в этом взгляде.","She started talking about drugs.

"В это самое время Иван Ильич провалился, увидал свет, и ему открылось, что жизнь его была не то, что надо, но что это можно еще поправить. Он спросил себя: что же «то», и затих, прислушиваясь. Тут он почувствовал, что руку его целует кто-то. Он открыл глаза и взглянул на сына. Ему стало жалко его. Жена подошла к нему. Он взглянул на нее. Она с открытым ртом и с неотертыми слезами на носу и щеке, с отчаянным выражением смотрела на него. Ему жалко стало ее.","At that very time Ivan Ilyich failed, saw the light, and it was revealed to him that his life was not what he needed, but that this could still be improved.

"И вот эта поездка Ивана Ильича увенчалась удивительным, неожиданным успехом. В Курске подсел в первый класс Ф. С. Ильин, знакомый, и сообщил свежую телеграмму, полученную курским губернатором, что в министерстве произойдет на днях переворот: на место Петра Ивановича назначают Ивана Семеновича.","And this trip of Ivan Ilyich was crowned with an amazing, unexpected success.

The planned upheaval, apart from its significance for Russia, had a particular significance for Ivan Ilyich: by promoting a new face, Pyotr Petrovich, and of course Zakhar Ivanovich, his classmate and friend, it was highly propitious for him.","And his trip was crowned with unexpected, unbelievable success. At Kursk, an acquaintance of his, F. S. Ilyin, got into his first-class carriage, sat down and told him that the governor of the province had just received a telegram informing him of a reshuffle in the ministry — Pyotr Ivanovich was being replaced by Ivan Semyonovich.

"Главное мучение Ивана Ильича была ложь, — та, всеми почему-то признанная ложь, что он только болен, а не умирает, и что ему надо только быть спокойным и лечиться, и тогда что-то выйдет очень хорошее. Он же знал, что, что бы ни делали, ничего не выйдет, кроме еще более мучительных страданий и смерти. И его мучила эта ложь, мучило то, что не хотели признаться в том, что все знали и он знал, а хотели лгать над ним по случаю ужасного его положения и хотели и заставляли его самого принимать участие в этой лжи. Ложь, ложь эта, совершаемая над ним накануне его смерти, ложь, долженствующая низвести этот страшный торжественный акт его смерти до уровня всех их визитов, гардин, осетрины к обеду… была ужасно мучительна для Ивана Ильича. И — странно — он много раз, когда они над ним проделывали свои штуки, был на волоске от того, чтобы закричать им: перестаньте врать, и вы знаете и я знаю, что я умираю, так перестаньте, по крайней мере, врать. Но никогда он не имел духа сделать этого. Страшный, ужасный акт его умирания, он видел, всеми окружающими его был низведен на степень случайной неприятности, отчасти неприличия (вроде того, как обходятся с человеком, который, войдя в гостиную, распространяет от себя дурной запах), тем самым «приличием», которому он служил всю свою жизнь; он видел, что никто не пожалеет его, потому что никто не хочет даже понимать его положения. Один только Герасим понимал это положение и жалел его. И потому Ивану Ильичу хорошо было только с Герасимом. Ему хорошо было, когда Герасим, иногда целые ночи напролет, держал его ноги и не хотел уходить спать, говоря: «Вы не извольте беспокоиться, Иван Ильич, высплюсь еще»; или когда он вдруг, переходя на «ты», прибавлял: «Кабы ты не больной, а то отчего же не послужить?» Один Герасим не лгал, по всему видно было, что он один понимал, в чем дело, и не считал нужным скрывать этого, и просто жалел исчахшего, слабого барина. Он даже раз прямо сказал, когда Иван Ильич отсылал его:","Ivan Ilyich's main torment was the lie, that lie, for some reason recognized by everyone, that he was only ill and not dying, and that he only needed to be calm and treated, and then something very good would come of it. He knew that no matter what they did, nothing would come of it, except for even more painful suffering and death. And he was tormented by this lie, tormented by the fact that they did not want to admit that everyone knew and he knew, but they wanted to lie about him on the occasion of his terrible situation and wanted and forced him to take part in this lie. The lie, this lie committed against him on the eve of his death, the lie that was supposed to reduce this terrible solemn act of his death to the level of all their visits, curtains, sturgeon for dinner ... was terribly painful for Ivan Ilyich. And - strangely - many times, when they did their tricks on him, he was within a hair's breadth of screaming at them: stop lying, and you know and I know that I'm dying, so at least stop lying. But he never had the heart to do so. The terrible, terrible act of his dying, he saw, was reduced by everyone around him to the degree of an accidental unpleasantness, partly indecent (like the way they treat a person who, upon entering the living room, spreads a bad smell from himself), thereby ""decency"", whom he served all his life; he saw that no one would take pity on him, because no one even wanted to understand his position. Only Gerasim understood this situation and pitied him. And therefore Ivan Ilyich felt good only with Gerasim. It was good for him when Gerasim, sometimes all night long, held his legs and did not want to go to sleep, saying: ""You don't have to worry, Ivan Ilyich, I'll get some more sleep""; or when he suddenly, switching to “you”, added: “If you are not sick, why not serve?” Only Gerasim did not lie, it was clear from everything that he alone understood what was the matter, and did not consider it necessary to hide it, and simply pitied the emaciated, weak gentleman. He even said bluntly once when Ivan Ilyich sent him away:","Ivan Ilyich’s chief torment was the lie—that lie, for some reason recognized by everyone, that he was only ill but not dying, and that he only needed rest and treatment and then there would be some very good outcome. But he knew that whatever they did, there would be no outcome except even more painful suffering and death. And he was tormented by this lie; he was tormented by their unwillingness to acknowledge what everyone knew and he knew, by their wanting to lie to him about his terrible situation, by their wanting him to and making him take part in that lie himself. The lie, this lie being perpetrated above him on the eve of his death, the lie which could only bring down this terrible solemn act of his death to the level of all their visits and curtains and sturgeon for dinner . . . was horribly painful for Ivan Ilyich. And, strangely, many times when they were performing their tricks above him, he was within a hair’s breadth of crying out to them, “ Stop lying; you know and I know that I am dying; so at least stop lying.” But he never had the strength to do it. The terrible, horrific act of his dying, he saw, had been brought down by all those surrounding him to the level of a casual unpleasantness, some breach of decorum (as one treats a man who, entering a drawing room, emits a bad smell); brought down by that very “decorum” he had served his whole life, he saw that no one had pity for him because no one even wanted to understand his situation. Only Gerasim understood his situation and felt pity for him. And so Ivan Ilyich only felt comfortable with Gerasim. He felt comfortable when Gerasim held up his legs, sometimes for whole nights without a break, and wouldn’t go off to bed, saying, “Please, sir, don’t worry, Ivan Ilyich , I’ll still get plenty of sleep”; or when he would suddenly add, going over to the familiar “thou,” “ You’re sick, so why shouldn’t I do something for you?” Gerasim was the only one not to lie; everything showed he was the only one who understood what the matter was and didn’t think it necessary to hide it, and simply felt pity for his wasted, feeble master. He even once said directly when Ivan Ilyich was dismissing him:","Ivan Ilyich’s worst torment was the lying - the lie, which was somehow maintained by them all, that he wasn’t dying, he was only ill, and all he had to do was keep calm and follow doctor’s orders and then something good would emerge. Whereas he knew that, whatever was done to him, nothing would emerge but more and more agony, suffering and death. And this lie was torture for him - he was tortured by their unwillingness to acknowledge what they all knew and he knew; they wanted to lie to him about his terrible situation, and they wanted him - they were compelling him - to be a party to this lie. All this lying to him, lie upon lie, on the eve of his death, lying that was inexorably reducing the solemn act of his death to the same level as their social calls, their draperies, the sturgeon for dinner ... it was all a terrible torment for Ivan Ilyich. And strangely enough, on many occasions when they were acting out this farce in front of him, he was within a hair’s breadth of screaming at them, ‘Stop all this lying! You know and I know that I’m dying, so the least you can do is stop lying to me.’ But he never quite had the nerve to do it. He could see that the awful, terrible act of his dying had been reduced by those around him to the level of an unpleasant incident, something rather indecent (as if they were dealing with someone who had come into the drawing-room and let off a bad smell), and this was done by exploiting the very sense of ‘decency’ that he had been observing all his life. He could see that no one had any pity for him because no one had the slightest desire to understand his situation. Gerasim was the only one who did understand his situation, and he was sorry for him. This was why Ivan Ilyich felt comfortable only with Gerasim. It was a comfort to him when Gerasim, sometimes for nights on end, held his legs up and refused to go to bed, saying, ‘Please don’t worry about it, Ivan Ilyich. I’ll catch up on my sleep.’ Or else he would suddenly address him in familiar language and add, ‘It’d be different if you weren’t ill, but with things the way they are why shouldn’t I help you out?’ Gerasim was the only one who didn’t lie to him; everything showed that he was the only one who understood what was going on and saw no need to hide it. He just felt sorry for his weak and emaciated master. Once, when Ivan Ilyich was dismissing him, he put it quite bluntly: ‘We’ve all got to die one day.","What tormented Ivan Ilych most was the deception, the lie, which for some reason they all accepted, that he was not dying but was simply ill, and the only need keep quiet and undergo a treatment and then something very good would result. He however knew that do what they would nothing would come of it, only still more agonizing suffering and death. This deception tortured him — their not wishing to admit what they all knew and what he knew, but wanting to lie to him concerning his terrible condition, and wishing and forcing him to participate in that lie. Those lies — lies enacted over him on the eve of his death and destined to degrade this awful, solemn act to the level of their visitings, their curtains, their sturgeon for dinner — were a terrible agony for Ivan Ilych. And strangely enough, many times when they were going through their antics over him he had been within a hairbreadth of calling out to them: “ Stop lying! You know and I know that I am dying. Then at least stop lying about it!” But he had never had the spirit to do it. The awful, terrible act of his dying was, he could see, reduced by those about him to the level of a casual, unpleasant, and almost indecorous incident (as if someone entered a drawing room defusing an unpleasant odour) and this was done by that very decorum which he had served all his life long. He saw that no one felt for him, because no one even wished to grasp his position. Only Gerasim recognized it and pitied him. And so Ivan Ilych felt at ease only with him. He felt comforted when Gerasim supported his legs (sometimes all night long) and refused to go to bed, saying: “Don’t you worry, Ivan Ilych. I’ll get sleep enough later on,” or when he suddenly became familiar and exclaimed: “If you weren’t sick it would be another matter, but as it is, why should I grudge a little trouble?” Gerasim alone did not lie; everything showed that he alone understood the facts of the case and did not consider it necessary to disguise them, but simply felt sorry for his emaciated and enfeebled master. Once when Ivan Ilych was sending him away he even said straight out: “We shall all of us die, so why should I grudge a little trouble?” — expressing the fact that he did not think his work burdensome, because he was doing it for a dying man and hoped someone would do the same for him when his time came."

"— Поверьте… — и опять она разговорилась и высказала то, что было, очевидно, ее главным делом к нему; дело это состояло в вопросах о том, как бы по случаю смерти мужа достать денег от казны. Она сделала вид, что спрашивает у Петра Ивановича совета о пенсионе: но он видел, что она уже знает до мельчайших подробностей и то, чего он не знал: все то, что можно вытянуть от казны по случаю этой смерти; но что ей хотелось узнать, нельзя ли как-нибудь вытянуть еще побольше денег. Петр Иванович постарался выдумать такое средство, но, подумав несколько и из приличия побранив наше правительство за его скаредность, сказал, что, кажется, больше нельзя. Тогда она вздохнула и, очевидно, стала придумывать средство избавиться от своего посетителя. Он понял это, затушил папироску, встал, пожал руку и пошел в переднюю.","“Believe me…” and again she got into conversation and expressed what was obviously her main business with him; this matter consisted of questions about how, on the occasion of the death of her husband, to get money from the treasury. She pretended to ask Pyotr Ivanovich for advice about the pension: but he saw that she already knew down to the smallest detail and what he did not know: everything that could be extorted from the treasury on the occasion of this death; but what she wanted to know was whether there was some way to get even more money out of it. Pyotr Ivanovich tried to invent such a means, but after some thought and out of decency scolding our government for its stinginess, he said that it seemed that it was no longer possible. Then she sighed and apparently began to think of a means to get rid of her visitor. He understood this, put out his cigarette, got up, shook hands, and went into the hall.","“Believe me . . .” and again she talked away and unburdened herself of what was clearly her main business with him—how on her husband ’s death she could get money from the treasury. She gave the appearance of asking Pyotr Ivanovich for advice about the pension, but he saw that she already knew down to the smallest details even what he didn’t know—everything that one could extract from the public purse on this death—but that she wanted to learn if one couldn’t somehow extract a bit more money. Pyotr Ivanovich tried to think of a way, but, having thought a little and out of politeness abusing the government for its meanness, he said that he thought one couldn’t get more. Then she sighed and clearly began to think of a way to get rid of her visitor. He understood this, put out his cigarette, got up, shook her hand, and went into the hall.","Then she spoke out again, and told him what must have been the main reason for consulting him: it was all a matter of using the death of her husband to get some money from the Treasury. She made it seem as if she was asking Pyotr Ivanovich’s advice about getting a pension, but he could see that here she knew more than he did, she knew the finest details of this subject down to the last penny that could be screwed out of the Treasury in terms of death benefits. What she wanted to know was whether there might be some way of screwing a bit more out of them. Pyotr Ivanovich tried to think of some way of doing this but, having given it some thought and doing the decent thing by cursing the government for being so stingy, he said he thought there was no more to be had. Upon which she gave a sigh, and made no bones about getting rid of her visitor. He got the message, stubbed his cigarette out, stood up, shook hands, and went out into the hall.","“ and she again began talking and brought out what was evidently her chief concern with him — namely, to question him as to how she could obtain a grant of money from the government on the occasion of her husband’s death. She made it appear that she was asking Peter Ivanovich’s advice about her pension, but he soon saw that she already knew about that to the minutest detail, more even than he did himself. She knew how much could be got out of the government in consequence of her husband’s death, but wanted to find out whether she could not possibly extract something more. Peter Ivanovich tried to think of some means of doing so, but after reflecting for a while and, out of propriety, condemning the government for its niggardliness, he said he thought that nothing more could be got. Then she sighed and evidently began to devise means of getting rid of her visitor. Noticing this, he put out his cigarette, rose, pressed her hand, and went out into the anteroom."

"Боль не уменьшалась; но Иван Ильич делал над собой усилия, чтобы заставлять себя думать, что ему лучше. И он мог обманывать себя, пока ничего не волновало его. Но как только случалась неприятность с женой, неудача в службе, дурные карты в винте, так сейчас он чувствовал всю силу своей болезни; бывало, он переносил эти неудачи, ожидая, что вот-вот исправлю плохое, поборю, дождусь успеха, большого шлема. Теперь же всякая неудача подкашивала его и ввергала в отчаяние. Он говорил себе: вот только что я стал поправляться и лекарство начинало уже действовать, и вот это проклятое несчастие или неприятность… И он злился на несчастье или на людей, делавших ему неприятности и убивающих его, и чувствовал, как эта злоба убивает его; но не мог воздержаться от нее. Казалось бы, ему должно бы было быть ясно, что это озлобление его на обстоятельства и людей усиливает его болезнь и что поэтому ему надо не обращать внимания на неприятные случайности; но он делал совершенно обратное рассуждение: он говорил, что ему нужно спокойствие, следил за всем, что нарушало это спокойствие, и при всяком малейшем нарушении приходил в раздражение. Ухудшало его положение то, что он читал медицинские книги и советовался с докторами. Ухудшение шло так равномерно, что он мог себя обманывать, сравнивая один день с другим, — разницы было мало. Но когда он советовался с докторами, тогда ему казалось, что идет к худшему и очень быстро даже. И несмотря на это, он постоянно советовался с докторами.","The pain did not decrease; but Ivan Ilyich made efforts to force himself to think that he was better off. And he could deceive himself as long as nothing worried him. But as soon as there was trouble with his wife, a failure in the service, bad cards in the screw, so now he felt the full force of his illness; he used to endure these failures, expecting that he was about to correct the bad, to overcome, to wait for success, a grand slam. Now, every failure crippled him and plunged him into despair. He said to himself: just now I began to get better and the medicine was already beginning to act, and now this damned misfortune or unpleasantness ... And he was angry at the misfortune or at the people who made him unpleasant and killed him, and felt how this anger was killing him; but could not refrain from it. It would seem that it should have been clear to him that his anger at circumstances and people intensifies his illness and that therefore he should not pay attention to unpleasant accidents; but he made quite the opposite reasoning: he said that he needed calmness, followed everything that disturbed this calmness, and at every slightest violation he became irritated. What worsened his situation was that he read medical books and consulted doctors. The deterioration went on so evenly that he could deceive himself by comparing one day with another - there was little difference. But when he consulted with doctors, then it seemed to him that things were getting worse and even very quickly. And despite this, he constantly consulted with doctors.","The pain got no less but Ivan Ilyich made an effort to force himself to think he was better. And he could deceive himself as long as nothing disturbed him. But as soon as there was some unpleasantness with his wife or something went wrong at work or he had bad cards at vint, he at once felt the full force of his illness. In the past he had endured things going wrong in the expectation that I’ll soon put things right, I’ll overcome, I’ll be successful, I’ll get a grand slam. Now anything that went wrong brought him down and cast him into despair. He would say to himself, “I was just starting to get better and the medicine was already beginning to work, and along comes this cursed accident or unpleasantness. . . .” And he was angry with the accident or with the people who were causing him unpleasantnesses and killing him, and he felt that this anger was killing him but he couldn’t restrain himself. One might have thought it would have been clear to him that this anger against circumstances and people made his illness worse, and that therefore he shouldn’t pay any attention to unpleasant incidents, but his reasoning was quite the reverse: He said he needed calm; he watched out for anything that might breach that calm and at the smallest breach he got angry. His condition was made worse by the fact that he consulted medical books and doctors. His deterioration progressed so evenly that comparing one day with another he could deceive himself—there was little difference. But when he consulted doctors, he thought he was getting worse and that very quickly. And in spite of that he constantly consulted doctors.","The pain was not getting any less, but Ivan Ilyich made every effort to make himself believe he was feeling better. And he was able to delude himself as long as nothing upset him. But the moment he fell out with his wife, or something went wrong at work or he got a bad hand at whist, he felt the full force of his illness. Before this he had been able to withstand setbacks like these, expecting to put things right before long, to win through, succeed again, come out with a grand slam. But now the slightest setback cut the ground from under him and left him in despair. He would say to himself, ‘Look at that. I was just starting to get better and the medicine was just beginning to work, and now this damn thing comes up, this rotten luck...’ And he raged against his misfortune or against those people who were causing his problems and killing him off; he sensed that it was his own rage that was killing him and he couldn’t control it. It ought to have been obvious to him that raging against his situation and the people around him was only feeding his illness and, because of that, he ought to ignore any unpleasant developments, but he thought the exact opposite: he told himself he needed peace of mind so he had to get on to anything that disrupted his peace of mind, and the slightest disruption left him exasperated. His situation was made worse by the fact that he had taken to reading medical books and consulting doctors. The decline was so gradual that he was able to delude himself by comparing one day with another and seeing little difference. But the moment he consulted a doctor he thought he was going downhill, and fast. Yet, despite this, he kept on consulting the doctors.","The pain did not grow less, but Ivan Ilych made efforts to force himself to think that he was better. And he could do this so long as nothing agitated him. But as soon as he had any unpleasantness with his wife, any lack of success in his official work, or held bad cards at bridge, he was at once acutely sensible of his disease. He had formerly borne such mischances, hoping soon to adjust what was wrong, to master it and attain success, or make a grand slam. But now every mischance upset him and plunged him into despair. He would say to himself: “there now, just as I was beginning to get better and the medicine had begun to take effect, comes this accursed misfortune, or unpleasantness... “ And he was furious with the mishap, or with the people who were causing the unpleasantness and killing him, for he felt that this fury was killing him but he could not restrain it. One would have thought that it should have been clear to him that this exasperation with circumstances and people aggravated his illness, and that he ought therefore to ignore unpleasant occurrences. But he drew the very opposite conclusion: he said that he needed peace, and he watched for everything that might disturb it and became irritable at the slightest infringement of it. His condition was rendered worse by the fact that he read medical books and consulted doctors. The progress of his disease was so gradual that he could deceive himself when comparing one day with another — the difference was so slight. But when he consulted the doctors it seemed to him that he was getting worse, and even very rapidly. Yet despite this he was continually consulting them."

"«Каково, умер; а я вот нет», — подумал или почувствовал каждый. Близкие же знакомые, так называемые друзья Ивана Ильича, при этом подумали невольно и о том, что теперь им надобно исполнить очень скучные обязанности приличия и поехать на панихиду и к вдове с визитом соболезнования.","“What, died; but I’m not,” thought or felt everyone. At the same time, close acquaintances, the so-called friends of Ivan Ilyich, involuntarily thought about the fact that now they need to fulfill very boring duties of decency and go to a memorial service and to the widow with a visit of condolences.","So—he’s dead; but here I am still, each thought or felt. At this point his closer acquaintances, the so-called friends of Ivan Ilyich, involuntarily thought that they now needed to carry out the very tedious requirements of etiquette and go to the requiem service2 and pay a visit of condolence to the widow.","‘There you have it. He’s dead, and I’m not ’ was what everyone thought or felt. But his closest acquaintances, Ivan Ilyich’s so-called friends, couldn’t help thinking that they would now have to fulfil some tedious social obligations such as attending the funeral and calling on the widow to express their condolences.","Each one thought or felt, “Well, he’s dead but I’m alive!” But the more intimate of Ivan Ilych’s acquaintances, his so-called friends, could not help thinking also that they would now have to fulfil the very tiresome demands of propriety by attending the funeral service and paying a visit of condolence to the widow."

"Для него все это произошло в одно мгновение, и значение этого мгновения уже не изменялось. Для присутствующих же агония его продолжалась еще два часа. В груди его клокотало что-то; изможденное тело его вздрагивало.

"И с сознанием этим, да еще с болью физической, да еще с ужасом надо было ложиться в постель и часто не спать от боли большую часть ночи.

"«А если это так, — сказал он себе, — и я ухожу из жизни с сознанием того, что погубил все, что мне дано было, и поправить нельзя, тогда что ж?» Он лег навзничь и стал совсем по-новому перебирать всю свою жизнь. Когда он увидал утром лакея, потом жену, потом дочь, потом доктора, — каждое их движение, каждое их слово подтверждало для него ужасную истину, открывшуюся ему ночью.

He saw in them himself, everything by which he had lived, and saw clearly that all this was wrong, all this was a terrible, huge fraud concealing both life and death.

In them he saw himself and all he had lived by, and he could clearly see that it was all wrong; it was all a gross deception obscuring life and death.

"В сущности же, было то самое, что бывает у всех не совсем богатых людей, но таких, которые хотят быть похожими на богатых и потому только похожи друг на друга: штофы, черное дерево, цветы, ковры и бронзы.

That evening, as they took tea, when Praskovya asked him casually about his fall he gave a laugh and demonstrated how he had gone flying and given the upholsterer a scare.","In reality it was just what is usually seen in the houses of people of moderate means who want to appear rich, and therefore succeed only in resembling others like themselves: there are damasks, dark wood, plants, rugs, and dull and polished bronzes — all the things people of a certain class have in order to resemble other people of that class.

"Часов до трех он был в мучительном забытьи. Ему казалось, что его с болью суют куда-то в узкий черный мешок и глубокий, и все дальше просовывают, и не могут просунуть. И это ужасное для него дело совершается с страданием. И он и боится, и хочет провалиться туда, и борется, и помогает. И вот вдруг он оборвался и упал, и очнулся. Все тот же Герасим сидит в ногах на постели, дремлет спокойно, терпеливо. А он лежит, подняв ему на плечи исхудалые ноги в чулках; свеча та же с абажуром, и та же непрекращающаяся боль.","Until three o'clock he was in painful oblivion. It seemed to him that with pain they were shoving him somewhere into a narrow black bag and a deep one, and they were pushing it farther and farther, and they could not push it through. And this terrible thing for him is done with suffering. And he is afraid, and wants to fall into it, and fights, and helps. And then suddenly he broke off and fell, and woke up. All the same Gerasim sits at his feet on the bed, dozing calmly, patiently. And he lies, raising his emaciated legs in stockings on his shoulders; the same candle with a lampshade, and the same incessant pain.","Till three o’clock he was in a tormented stupor. He thought that in some way they were pushing him and his pain into a narrow, deep, black sack; they kept pushing further but they couldn’t push them right in. And this terrible business for him was crowned by his suffering. And he was both struggling and wanting to drop right down, both fighting against it and assisting. And suddenly he was free and fell and came to. The same Gerasim was still sitting on the bed at his feet, dozing quietly, patiently. And Ivan Ilyich was lying there, having lifted his emaciated legs in their socks onto Gerasim’s shoulders; there was the same candle with its shade and the same unceasing pain.","Until about three in the morning he was in a state of excruciating pain and delirium. He dreamt that somehow he was being forced, along with his pain, into the depths of a narrow black sack, being forced further and further in and not quite getting there. It was a harrowing, agonizing process. And he was scared, he wanted to get through and out, he was struggling, trying to help. Then suddenly he lost his hold and fell, and woke up. Gerasim was still there, sitting at the foot of the bed, dozing quietly, patiently. And he himself was lying there with his withered stockinged legs raised up on Gerasim’s shoulders. The same candle was there, with its shade, and the same unremitting pain.","Till about three in the morning he was in a state of stupefied misery. It seemed to him that he and his pain were being thrust into a narrow, deep black sack, but though they were pushed further and further in they could not be pushed to the bottom.

Была приезжая Сарра Бернар, и у них была ложа, которую он настоял, чтоб они взяли. Теперь он забыл про это, и ее наряд оскорбил его.

"И Иван Ильич стал умываться. Он с отдыхом умыл руки, лицо, вычистил зубы, стал причесываться и посмотрел в зеркало. Ему страшно стало: особенно страшно было то, как волосы плоско прижимались к бледному лбу.","And Ivan Ilyich began to wash himself. He washed his hands and face with rest, brushed his teeth, began combing his hair and looked in the mirror. He felt frightened: the way his hair flattened against his pale forehead was especially frightening.","And Ivan Ilyich began to wash.

"— Однако, если ехать, то пора, — сказала она, взглянув на свои часы, подарок отца, и чуть заметно, значительно о чем-то, им одним известном, улыбнулась молодому человеку и встала, зашумев платьем. Все встали, простились и уехали.","“However, if you’re going, then it’s time,” she said, glancing at her watch, her father’s gift, and slightly perceptibly, significantly about something known to them alone, smiled at the young man and stood up, rustling her dress. Everyone got up, said goodbye and left.","“So, if we are going to go, it’s time,” she said, looking at her watch, a present from her father, and she gave a barely perceptible smile to the young man, which meant something known to them alone, and got up, her dress rustling.

"«Меня не будет, так что же будет? Ничего не будет. Так где же я буду, когда меня не будет? Неужели смерть? Нет, не хочу». Он вскочил, хотел зажечь свечку, пошарил дрожащими руками, уронил свечу с подсвечником на пол и опять повалился назад, на подушку. «Зачем? Все равно, — говорил он себе, открытыми глазами глядя в темноту. — Смерть. Да, смерть. И они никто не знают, и не хотят знать, и не жалеют. Они играют. (Он слышал дальние, из-за двери, раскат голоса и ритурнели.) Им все равно, а они также умрут. Дурачье. Мне раньше, а им после; и им то же будет. А они радуются. Скоты!» Злоба душила его. И ему стало мучительно, невыносимо тяжело. Не может же быть, чтоб все всегда были обречены на этот ужасный страх. Он поднялся.","“I won’t be, so what will be? Nothing will happen. So where will I be when I'm gone? Is it death? No I do not want to"". He jumped up, wanted to light a candle, groped around with trembling hands, dropped the candle with the candlestick on the floor and again fell back onto the pillow. ""What for? It doesn't matter, he said to himself, looking into the darkness with open eyes. - Death. Yes, death. And they do not know anyone, and do not want to know, and do not regret. They are playing. (He heard distant voices and ritornellos from behind the door.) They don't care, but they will also die. Fools. To me before, and to them after; and they will be the same. And they rejoice. Cattle!"" Anger choked him. And it became painful, unbearably hard for him. It cannot be that everyone has always been doomed to this terrible fear. He got up.","“I won’t exist, so what will exist? Nothing will exist. So where will I be when I don’t exist? Is this really death? No, I don’t want it.” He got up quickly, tried to light a candle, groped with shaking hands, dropped the candle and candlestick on the floor, and slumped back again onto the pillow. “Why? Nothing matters,” he said to himself, looking into the darkness with open eyes. “Death. Yes, death. And none of them knows and they don’t want to know and they have no pity for me. They’re enjoying themselves.” Outside the door he could hear the distant noise of music and singing. “They don’t care but they too will die. Fools. It’ll come to me first, to them later; they too will have the same. But they’re having fun, the beasts!” Anger choked him. And he felt painful, unbearable misery. “It cannot be that we’re all doomed to this terrible fear.” He raised himself.","‘When I’m dead, what happens then? Nothing happens. So where shall I be when I’m no longer here? Is this really death? No, I won’t have it!’ He jumped up, tried to light the candle, fumbling with trembling hands, dropped the candle and the stick on the floor and flopped back down on to his pillow. ‘Why bother? It doesn’t make any difference,’ he said to himself, staring into the darkness with his eyes wide open. ‘ Death. Yes, it’s death. And not one of them knows, or wants to know. They have no pity for me. Too busy playing.’ (Through the door he could hear the distant sounds of a singing voice and the accompaniment.) ‘They don’t care, but they’re going to die, too. Fools! Me first, then them, but they’ve got it coming to them. And they’re enjoying themselves! Animals!’ He was choking with spite. And he felt a wave of agonizing, unbearable misery. It surely wasn’t possible that everybody everywhere should be condemned to this awful horror. He sat up.","“When I am not, what will there be? There will be nothing. Then where shall I be when I am no more? Can this be dying? No, I don’t want to!” He jumped up and tried to light the candle, felt for it with trembling hands, dropped candle and candlestick on the floor, and fell back on his pillow. “What’s the use? It makes no difference,” he said to himself, staring with wide-open eyes into the darkness. “Death. Yes, death. And none of them knows or wishes to know it, and they have no pity for me. Now they are playing.” (He heard through the door the distant sound of a song and its accompaniment.) “It’s all the same to them, but they will die too! Fools! I first, and they later, but it will be the same for them. And now they are merry... the beasts!” Anger choked him and he was agonizingly, unbearably miserable. “It is impossible that all men have been doomed to suffer this awful horror!” He raised himself."
"Поздно ночью вернулась жена. Она вошла на цыпочках, но он услыхал ее: открыл глаза и поспешно закрыл опять. Она хотела услать Герасима и сама сидеть с ним.

Ближе, ближе. И вот я исчах, у меня света в глазах нет. И смерть, а я думаю о кишке. Думаю о том, чтобы починить кишку, а это смерть. Неужели смерть?» Опять на него нашел ужас, он запыхался, нагнулся, стал искать спичек, надавил локтем на тумбочку. Она мешала ему и делала больно, он разозлился на нее, надавил с досадой сильнее и повалил тумбочку. И в отчаянии задыхаясь, он повалился на спину, ожидая сейчас же смерти.","“Something is wrong; you need to calm down, you need to think it all over again.

Less strength. Closer, closer. And now I'm wasting away, I have no light in my eyes. And death, and I think about the gut. Thinking about fixing the gut, and that's death. Is it death? Again horror came over him, he was out of breath, bent down, began to look for matches, pressed his elbow on the bedside table. She interfered with him and hurt him, he got angry with her, pressed harder with annoyance and knocked down the bedside table. And panting in despair, he fell on his back, expecting death at once.","“Something’s not right; I must calm down, I must think over everything from the outset.” And he began to think. “Yes, the start of my illness.

Less strength. Nearer and nearer. And now I’ve wasted away , there’s no light in my eyes. And death, and I think about my appendix. I think of how to mend my appendix, but this is death. Is it really death?” Again horror came over him; he bent down, tried to find the matches, and banged his elbow on the nighttable. It got in his way and hurt him; he got angry with it; in his irritation he banged his elbow harder and knocked the nighttable over. And in his despair he fell back, gasping for breath, expecting death to come now.","‘Something’s not right. I’ve got to calm down and think it through from the beginning.’ And he began to think. ‘Yes, the beginning of the illness. I banged my side, but I felt just the same that day and the next.

And I’ve been wasting away. No light in my eyes. Death is here, and I’ve been worrying about my gut. Worrying about getting my gut better, and this is death. Is it really death?’ Horror swept over him again, he gasped for breath, bent over and groped for the matches, leaning with one elbow on the bedside table. It was in his way, hurting him; he lost his temper with it, pressing down on it even harder in exasperation, and knocked it over. Breathless and in despair, he flopped down on to his back, expecting to die at any moment.","“Something must be wrong. I must calm myself — must think it all over from the beginning.” And he again began thinking. “Yes, the beginning of my illness: I knocked my side, but I was still quite well that day and the next. It hurt a little, then rather more. I saw the doctors, then followed despondency and anguish, more doctors, and I drew nearer to the abyss. My strength grew less and I kept coming nearer and nearer, and now I have wasted away and there is no light in my eyes. I think of the appendix — but this is death! I think of mending the appendix, and all the while here is death! Can it really be death?” Again terror seized him and he gasped for breath. He leant down and began feeling for the matches, pressing with his elbow on the stand beside the bed. It was in his way and hurt him, he grew furious with it, pressed on it still harder, and upset it. Breathless and in despair he fell on his back, expecting death to come immediately."

"Так шла жизнь Ивана Ильича в продолжение семнадцати лет со времени женитьбы.

"Доктор строго взглянул на него одним глазом через очки, как будто говоря: подсудимый, если вы не будете оставаться в пределах ставимых вам вопросов, я буду принужден сделать распоряжение об удалении вас из зала заседания.","The doctor looked sternly at him with one eye through his spectacles, as if to say: Defendant, if you do not remain within the limits of the questions put to you, I will be forced to issue an order to remove you from the courtroom.","The doctor gave him one stern look through his glasses as if to say: Accused, if you will not stay within the boundaries of the questions that are put to you, then I will be compelled to give instructions for your removal from the courtroom.","The doctor glared at him through one eye over his glasses as if to say, ‘Prisoner in the dock, if you will not confine yourself to answering the questions put to you I shall have to arrange for you to be removed from the courtroom.’","The doctor looked at him sternly over his spectacles with one eye, as if to say: “Prisoner, if you will not keep to the questions put to you, I shall be obliged to have you removed from the court.”"
"В суде Иван Ильич замечал или думал, что замечает, то же странное к себе отношение: то ему казалось, что к нему приглядываются, как к человеку, имеющему скоро опростать место; то вдруг его приятели начинали дружески подшучивать над его мнительностью, как будто то, что-то ужасное и страшное, неслыханное, что завелось в нем и не переставая сосет его и неудержимо влечет куда-то, есть самый приятный предмет для шутки. Особенно Шварц своей игривостью, жизненностью и комильфотностью, напоминавшими Ивану Ильичу его самого за десять лет назад, раздражал его.","In court, Ivan Ilyich noticed, or thought he noticed, the same strange attitude towards himself: sometimes it seemed to him that they were looking at him as if he were a person who would soon have a job to do; then all of a sudden his friends would begin to play a friendly joke on his suspiciousness, as if that something terrible and terrible, unheard of, that started up in him and constantly sucked him and irresistibly attracted him somewhere, was the most pleasant subject for a joke. Especially Schwartz, with his playfulness, vitality and comme il faut, which reminded Ivan Ilyich of himself ten years ago, irritated him.","In court Ivan Ilyich noticed or thought he noticed the same strange attitude to him: now he would think that people were scrutinizing him like a man whose position was soon going to be vacant; now all of a sudden his friends would start to joke in an amicable way about his hypochondria, as if this thing, this awful, terrible, unheard-of thing that had grown in him and was ceaselessly gnawing at him and irrepressibly dragging him somewhere, were the most pleasant subject for a joke. He was especially irritated by Schwarz with his playfulness and energy and comme il faut ways, all of which reminded Ivan Ilyich of himself ten years back.","In court Ivan Ilyich noticed, or thought he noticed, the same strange attitude towards him. There were times when he thought people were watching him closely like a man who was about to give up his job; at other times his associates would make friendly little jokes about the way he worried over his health, as if this ghastly, fearful, unheard-of thing that had got going inside him and was now incessantly gnawing at him and inexorably taking him away was a good subject and a laughing matter. The one who infuriated him most was Schwartz, with his playfulness, joie de vivre and all-round respectability which recalled the Ivan Ilyich of ten years before.","At the law courts too, Ivan Ilych noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude towards himself. It sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant. Then again, his friends would suddenly begin to chaff him in a friendly way about his low spirits, as if the awful, horrible, and unheard-of thing that was going on within him, incessantly gnawing at him and irresistibly drawing him away, was a very agreeable subject for jests. Schwartz in particular irritated him by his jocularity, vivacity, and savoir-faire, which reminded him of what he himself had been ten years ago."

"Иван Ильич был сотоварищ собравшихся господ, и все любили его. Он болел уже несколько недель; говорили, что болезнь его неизлечима. Место оставалось за ним, но было соображение о том, что в случае его смерти Алексеев может быть назначен на его место, на место же Алексеева — или Винников, или Штабель.

"И такое отношение к супружеской жизни выработал себе Иван Ильич. Он требовал от семейной жизни только тех удобств домашнего обеда, хозяйки, постели, которые она могла дать ему, и, главное, того приличия внешних форм, которые определялись общественным мнением. В остальном же он искал веселой приятности и, если находил их, был очень благодарен; если же встречал отпор и ворчливость, то тотчас же уходил в свой отдельный, выгороженный им мир службы и в нем находил приятности.","And Ivan Ilyich worked out such an attitude towards married life. He demanded from family life only those conveniences of a home dinner, a hostess, a bed that she could give him, and, most importantly, that decency of external forms that were determined by public opinion. For the rest, he looked for cheerful pleasantries and, if he found them, was very grateful; if he met resistance and grouchiness, he immediately went into his separate world of service, shielded by him, and found pleasantries in it.","And Ivan Ilyich did develop for himself such a relationship with married life.

He required of it whatever domestic conveniences it could provide in terms of meals on the table, a good household and a bed and, most important, the outward show of respectability that society required. Beyond this, he required some enjoyment and pleasure, and if he found this he was very thankful, but if he was met with rejection and crabbiness he immediately took himself off into his own separate, carefully guarded world, the world of work which gave him pleasure.","And Ivan Ilych evolved such an attitude towards married life. He only required of it those conveniences — dinner at home, housewife, and bed — which it could give him, and above all that propriety of external forms required by public opinion.

"Ее отношение к нему и его болезни все то же. Как доктор выработал себе отношение к больным, которое он не мог уже снять, так она выработала одно отношение к нему — то, что он не делает чего-то того, что нужно, и сам виноват, и она любовно укоряет его в этом, — и не могла уже снять этого отношения к нему.","Her attitude towards him and his illness is the same. Just as the doctor developed an attitude towards his patients, which he could no longer get rid of, so she developed one attitude towards him - that he does not do something that is necessary, and it is his own fault, and she lovingly reproaches him for this, - and could no longer remove this relationship to him.","Her attitude to him and to his illness is always the same. Just as the doctor has developed for himself an attitude toward his patients which he hasn’t been able to put aside, so has she developed a simple attitude towards him—he isn’t doing something he should be doing, and it’s his fault, and she lovingly scolds him for this—and she hasn’t yet managed to put this attitude toward him aside.","Her attitude towards him and his illness is still the same.

"Мертвец лежал, как всегда лежат мертвецы, особенно тяжело, по-мертвецки, утонувши окоченевшими членами в подстилке гроба, с навсегда согнувшеюся головой на подушке, и выставлял, как всегда выставляют мертвецы, свой желтый восковой лоб с взлизами на ввалившихся висках и торчащий нос, как бы надавивший на верхнюю губу. Он очень переменился, еще похудел с тех пор, как Петр Иванович не видал его, но, как у всех мертвецов, лицо его было красивее, главное — значительнее, чем оно было у живого. На лице было выражение того, что то, что нужно было сделать, сделано, и сделано правильно. Кроме того, в этом выражении был еще упрек или напоминание живым. Напоминание это показалось Петру Ивановичу неуместным или, по крайней мере, до него не касающимся. Что-то ему стало неприятно, и потому Петр Иванович еще раз поспешно перекрестился и, как ему показалось, слишком поспешно, несообразно с приличиями, повернулся и пошел к двери. Шварц ждал его в проходной комнате, расставив широко ноги и играя обеими руками за спиной своим цилиндром. Один взгляд на игривую, чистоплотную и элегантную фигуру Шварца освежил Петра Ивановича. Петр Иванович понял, что он, Шварц, стоит выше этого и не поддается удручающим впечатлениям. Один вид его говорил: инцидент панихиды Ивана Ильича никак не может служить достаточным поводом для признания порядка заседания нарушенным, то есть что ничто не может помешать нынче же вечером щелкануть, распечатывая ее, колодой карт, в то время как лакей будет расставлять четыре необожженные свечи; вообще нет основания предполагать, чтобы инцидент этот мог помешать нам провести приятно и сегодняшний вечер. Он и сказал это шепотом проходившему Петру Ивановичу, предлагая соединиться на партию у Федора Васильевича. Но, видно, Петру Ивановичу была не судьба винтить нынче вечером. Прасковья Федоровна, невысокая, жирная женщина, несмотря на все старания устроить противное, все-таки расширявшаяся от плеч книзу, вся в черном, с покрытой кружевом головой и с такими же странно поднятыми бровями, как и та дама, стоявшая против гроба, вышла из своих покоев с другими дамами и, проводив их в дверь мертвеца, сказала:","The dead man lay, as dead men always lie, especially heavily, like a dead man, sunk with stiff limbs in the lining of the coffin, with his head forever bent on the pillow, and exposed, as the dead always do, his yellow waxy forehead with slicks on sunken temples and protruding nose, as if pressing on the upper lip. He had changed a lot, had grown even thinner since Pyotr Ivanovich had not seen him, but, like all the dead, his face was more beautiful, most importantly, more significant than it was on the living. There was an expression on his face that what needed to be done was done, and done right. In addition, in this expression there was also a reproach or a reminder to the living. This reminder seemed to Pyotr Ivanovich inappropriate, or at least not of concern to him. Something became unpleasant to him, and therefore Pyotr Ivanovich hurriedly crossed himself again and, as it seemed to him, too hastily, inconsistently with decency, turned and went to the door. Schwartz was waiting for him in the entrance room, legs wide apart and playing with both hands behind his back with his top hat. One look at the playful, clean and elegant figure of Schwartz refreshed Pyotr Ivanovich. Pyotr Ivanovich realized that he, Schwartz, stood above this and did not succumb to depressing impressions. One look at him said: the incident of Ivan Ilyich's memorial service cannot in any way serve as a sufficient reason for recognizing the order of the meeting as violated, that is, that nothing can prevent this evening from clicking, opening it, with a deck of cards, while the footman will arrange four unburned candles; there is no reason at all to suppose that this incident could prevent us from enjoying a pleasant evening as well. He said this in a whisper to Pyotr Ivanovich, who was passing by, suggesting that they join the party at Fyodor Vasilyevich's. But, apparently, Pyotr Ivanovich was not destined to screw this evening. Praskovya Fyodorovna, a short, fat woman, despite all her efforts to arrange the opposite, nevertheless swelled from the shoulders down, all in black, with a head covered with lace and with the same strangely raised eyebrows as the lady standing opposite the coffin, came out of her chambers with other ladies and, escorting them to the door of the dead man, she said:","The dead man lay, as dead men always do, especially heavily, his stiffened limbs sunk in the padded lining of the coffin with his head bent back forever on the pillow, and, as always with dead men, his yellow waxen forehead sticking out, showing bald patches on his hollow temples, his nose protruding as if it pressed on his upper lip. He had greatly changed, had become even thinner since Pyotr Ivanovich had seen him, but like all dead men, his face was handsomer, above all more imposing than when he was alive. On his face was an expression that said what had to be done had been done, and done properly. This expression also held a reproach or reminder to the living. Pyotr Ivanovich found this reminder inappropriate—or at the least one not applying to himself. This gave Pyotr Ivanovich an unpleasant feeling, and so he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned, too hurriedly he thought, and not in accordance with propriety, and went to the door. Schwarz was waiting for him in the next room, his legs wide apart and both hands playing behind his back with his top hat. One look at Schwarz’s playful, neat, and elegant figure refreshed Pyotr Ivanovich. Pyotr Ivanovich felt that Schwarz stood above all this and didn’t allow himself to give in to depressing thoughts. The very way he looked stated the following: the fact of Ivan Ilyich’s requiem cannot serve as a sufficient reason to consider the order of the courts disrupted; in other words, nothing can stop us unsealing and shuffling a pack of cards this evening while the manservant puts out four fresh candles; in general there are no grounds for assuming that this fact can prevent us from spending a pleasant evening, even today. He said this in a whisper to Pyotr Ivanovich as he came in, proposing they meet for a game at Fyodor Vasilyevich’s. But apparently Pyotr Ivanovich was not fated to play vint this evening. Praskovya Fyodorovna, a short, plump woman who broadened from the shoulders down in spite of all her efforts to achieve the opposite, was dressed all in black with her head covered in lace and with oddly arched eyebrows like the lady standing by the coffin. She came out of her rooms with the other ladies, and taking them to the door where the dead man lay, said:","The dead man lay as all dead men lie, unusually heavy with his dead weight, with rigid limbs sinking into the soft lining of the coffin and his head bowed for eternity on the pillow, and he displayed what dead people always display, a waxen yellow forehead (with bald patches over his hollow temples) and a protruding nose that seemed to be pressing down hard on his upper lip. He had changed a good deal; he was even thinner than he had been when Pyotr Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as with all dead bodies, his face had acquired greater beauty, or, more to the point, greater significance, than it had had in life. Its expression seemed to say that what needed to be done had been done, and done properly. More than that, the expression contained a reproach, or at least a reminder, to the living. The reminder seemed out of place to Pyotr Ivanovich, or at least he felt it didn’t apply to him personally. But an unpleasant feeling came over him, and he crossed himself again, hurriedly — too hurriedly, he thought, the haste was almost indecent — before turning and heading for the door. Schwartz was waiting for him in the next room with his feet planted wide apart and both hands fiddling with the top hat held behind his back. One glance at his mischievous, immaculately elegant figure and Pyotr Ivanovich felt restored. He could see that Schwartz was above all this, and would be impervious to anything that might have been depressing. His very appearance spoke volumes: in no way would the occasion of Ivan Ilyich’s funeral serve as a reason for cancelling their usual session; in other words, nothing would prevent them from breaking open a new pack and riffling through the cards that evening while a servant set up four new candles. There was, in fact, no reason to think that this occasion should stop them having a good time that very evening. He said so in a low voice to Pyotr Ivanovich as he walked past, proposing that they meet for a game at Fyodor Vasilyevich’s. But Pyotr Ivanovich was clearly not destined to play whist that evening. Praskovya Fyodorovna, a short, plump woman whose body expanded from the shoulders down despite her best efforts to the contrary, done out in black, with a lace shawl over her head and the same curiously arched eyebrows as the lady facing the coffin, emerged from her chambers with some other ladies, showed them to the door of the dead man’s room, and said, ‘The service is about to begin.","The dead man lay, as dead men always lie, in a specially heavy way, his rigid limbs sunk in the soft cushions of the coffin, with the head forever bowed on the pillow. His yellow waxen brow with bald patches over his sunken temples was thrust up in the way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose seeming to press on the upper lip. He was much changed and grown even thinner since Peter Ivanovich had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive. the expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, and accomplished rightly. Besides this there was in that expression a reproach and a warning to the living. This warning seemed to Peter Ivanovich out of place, or at least not applicable to him. He felt a certain discomfort and so he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door — too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware. Schwartz was waiting for him in the adjoining room with legs spread wide apart and both hands toying with his top-hat behind his back. The mere sight of that playful, well-groomed, and elegant figure refreshed Peter Ivanovich. He felt that Schwartz was above all these happenings and would not surrender to any depressing influences. His very look said that this incident of a church service for Ivan Ilych could not be a sufficient reason for infringing the order of the session — in other words, that it would certainly not prevent his unwrapping a new pack of cards and shuffling them that evening while a footman placed fresh candles on the table: in fact, that there was no reason for supposing that this incident would hinder their spending the evening agreeably. Indeed he said this in a whisper as Peter Ivanovich passed him, proposing that they should meet for a game at Fedor Vasilievich’s. But apparently Peter Ivanovich was not destined to play bridge that evening. Praskovya Fedorovna (a short, fat woman who despite all efforts to the contrary had continued to broaden steadily from her shoulders downwards and who had the same extraordinarily arched eyebrows as the lady who had been standing by the coffin), dressed all in black, her head covered with lace, came out of her own room with some other ladies, conducted them to the room where the dead body lay, and said: “The service will begin immediately."
"Федор Петрович спросил у Ивана Ильича, видел ли он Сарру Бернар. Иван Ильич не понял сначала того, что у него спрашивали, а потом сказал:","Fyodor Petrovich asked Ivan Ilyich if he had seen Sarah Bernhardt. Ivan Ilyich did not at first understand what was being asked of him, and then he said:",Fyodor Petrovich asked Ivan Ilyich if he had seen Sarah Bernhardt. At first Ivan Ilyich didn’t understand what he was being asked and then said:,"Fyodor asked Ivan Ilyich whether he had ever seen Sarah Bernhardt. At first Ivan Ilyich didn’t quite catch what the question was, but then he said, ‘No.","Fedor Petrovich inquired of Ivan Ilych whether he had ever seen Sarah Bernhardt. Ivan Ilych did not at first catch the question, but then replied: “No, have you seen her before?”"
"Жизнь Ивана Ильича и в новом городе сложилась очень приятно: фрондирующее против губернатора общество было дружное и хорошее; жалованья было больше, и немалую приятность в жизни прибавил тогда вист, в который стал играть Иван Ильич, имевший способность играть в карты весело, быстро соображая и очень тонко, так что в общем он всегда был в выигрыше.","The life of Ivan Ilyich in the new city turned out very pleasantly: the society that opposed the governor was friendly and good; the salary was higher, and then whist added no small pleasantness to life, which Ivan Ilyich began to play, who had the ability to play cards cheerfully, thinking quickly and very subtly, so that in general he always won.","Ivan Ilyich’s life turned out very pleasantly in the new city as well: the society that took a critical view of the governor was good and friendly; his salary was larger; and a not inconsiderable pleasure was added to his life by vint, which Ivan Ilyich started to play, having an ability to play cards cheerfully, quick-wittedly, and very shrewdly so that generally he won.","In his new town, too, Ivan Ilyich set himself up very nicely. The section of society opposed to the governor was friendly and agreeable, his pay had gone up, and one thing that made his life particularly pleasurable was the playing of whist, which he now took to with the enjoyment of a skilled card-player, astute, quick-thinking and almost invariably a winner.","Ivan Ilych settled down very pleasantly in this new town. The society there, which inclined towards opposition to the governor was friendly, his salary was larger, and he began to play vint [a form of bridge], which he found added not a little to the pleasure of life, for he had a capacity for cards, played good-humouredly, and calculated rapidly and astutely, so that he usually won."
"Когда он очнулся, стало смеркаться; ему принесли обедать. Он поел с усилием бульона; и опять то же, и опять наступающая ночь.","When he woke up, it was getting dark; they brought him lunch. He ate with the effort of the broth; and again the same thing, and again the coming night.","When he came to, it was beginning to get dark; they brought in his dinner. With some effort he took some broth; and again all those same things and again night was coming on.","When he came to, it was getting dark. They brought him his dinner. He forced down a little thin soup, then it was the same again, with another night coming on.","It was twilight when he came to. They brought him his dinner and he swallowed some beef tea with difficulty, and then everything was the same again and night was coming on."
"— Мы, больные, вероятно, часто делаем вам неуместные вопросы, — сказал он. — Вообще, это опасная болезнь или нет?..","“We sick people probably often ask you inappropriate questions,” he said. “Is it really a dangerous disease or not?”","“Probably we patients often put inappropriate questions to you. In general terms, is this a dangerous illness or not?”","He got up, laid his money on the table and said, with a sigh, ‘I’m sure that when we’re ill we ask a lot of pointless questions. But, er, is it life-threatening or not...?’","He said nothing of this, but rose, placed the doctor’s fee on the table, and remarked with a sigh: “We sick people probably often put inappropriate questions.

"Была в провинции и связь с одной из дам, навязавшейся щеголеватому правоведу; была и модистка; были и попойки с приезжими флигель-адъютантами и поездки в дальнюю улицу после ужина; было и подслуживанье начальнику и даже жене начальника, но все это носило на себе такой высокий тон порядочности, что все это не могло быть называемо дурными словами: все это подходило только под рубрику французского изречения: il faut que jeumesse se passe.[5] Все происходило с чистыми руками, в чистых рубашках, с французскими словами и, главное, в самом высшем обществе, следовательно, с одобрением высоко стоящих людей.","There was also a relationship in the provinces with one of the ladies who imposed herself on a dapper jurist; there was also a milliner; there were drinking parties with visiting adjutants and trips to a distant street after supper; there was also serving the boss and even the boss's wife, but all this carried such a high tone of decency that all this could not be called bad words: all this fit only under the rubric of the French saying: il faut que jeumesse se passe.[5] Everything happened with clean hands, in clean shirts, with French words and, most importantly, in the highest society, therefore, with the approval of high-ranking people.","There was also in the provincial city an affair with one of the ladies who attached herself to the smart lawyer; there was a little dressmaker; there were drinking sessions with visiting aides-de-camp and trips to a remote street after supper; there was also some fawning deference to his chief and even to his chief’s wife, but all this wore such a high tone of probity that it couldn’t be described in bad words; all this could only go under the rubric of the French expression il faut que jeunesse se passe.10 Everything took place with clean hands, in clean shirts, with French words, and, most importantly, in the highest society, consequently with the approval of people in high position.","In the provinces he had an affair with a lady only too keen to liaise with a smart young lawyer.

But all of this bore the stamp of high respectability to such an extent that no one could have called it by a bad name; all of it was catered for by what the French describe as ‘youth having its fling’. All of it was conducted with clean hands, in clean linen, in French phrases, and — what mattered most — at the highest level of society, which meant with approval from those in authority.","In the province he had an affair with a lady who made advances to the elegant young lawyer, and there was also a milliner; and there were carousals with aides-decamp who visited the district, and after-supper visits to a certain outlying street of doubtful reputation; and there was too some obsequiousness to his chief and even to his chief’s wife, but all this was done with such a tone of good breeding that no hard names could be applied to it. It all came under the heading of the French saying: “Il faut que jeunesse se passe.” It was all done with clean hands, in clean linen, with French phrases, and above all among people of the best society and consequently with the approval of people of rank."

"С рождением ребенка, попытками кормления и различными неудачами при этом, с болезнями действительными и воображаемыми ребенка и матери, в которых от Ивана Ильича требовалось участие, но в которых он ничего не мог понять, потребность для Ивана Ильича выгородить себе мир вне семьи стала еще более настоятельна.","With the birth of a child, attempts at feeding and various failures at the same time, with real and imaginary illnesses of the child and mother, in which Ivan Ilyich was required to participate, but in which he could not understand anything, the need for Ivan Ilyich to shield himself from the world outside the family became even more insistent.","A child was born. There were attempts at feeding and various failures in this, along with the real and imaginary illnesses of child and mother.

On September 10, he had to accept a post and, in addition, he needed time to settle in a new place, transport everything from the provinces, buy, order, and much more; in a word, arrange things as it was decided in his mind, and almost exactly the same way as it was decided in the soul of Praskovya Fyodorovna.","Ivan Ilyich had come just for a short time.

"В столовой с часами, которым Иван Ильич так рад был, что купил в брикабраке,[1] Петр Иванович встретил священника и еще несколько знакомых, приехавших на панихиду, и увидал знакомую ему красивую барышню, дочь Ивана Ильича. Она была вся в черном. Талия ее, очень тонкая, казалась еще тоньше. Она имела мрачный, решительный, почти гневный вид. Она поклонилась Петру Ивановичу, как будто он был в чем-то виноват. За дочерью стоял с таким же обиженным видом знакомый Петру Ивановичу богатый молодой человек, судебный следователь, ее жених, как он слышал. Он уныло поклонился им и хотел пройти в комнату мертвеца, когда из-под лестницы показалась фигурка гимназистика-сына, ужасно похожего на Ивана Ильича. Это был маленький Иван Ильич, каким Петр Иванович помнил его в Правоведении. Глаза у него были и заплаканные и такие, какие бывают у нечистых мальчиков в тринадцать — четырнадцать лет. Мальчик, увидав Петра Ивановича, стал сурово и стыдливо морщиться. Петр Иванович кивнул ему головой и вошел в комнату мертвеца. Началась панихида — свечи, стоны, ладан, слезы, всхлипыванья. Петр Иванович стоял нахмурившись, глядя на ноги перед собой. Он не взглянул ни разу на мертвеца и до конца не поддался расслабляющим влияниям и один из первых вышел. В передней никого не было. Герасим, буфетный мужик, выскочил из комнаты покойника, перешвырял своими сильными руками все шубы, чтобы найти шубу Петра Ивановича, и подал ее.","In the dining room with a clock, which Ivan Ilyich was so glad that he bought in a brikabrak, [1] Pyotr Ivanovich met the priest and several other acquaintances who had come to the memorial service, and saw a beautiful young lady he knew, the daughter of Ivan Ilyich. She was all in black. Her waist, very thin, seemed even thinner. She looked grim, determined, almost angry. She bowed to Pyotr Ivanovich, as if he were to blame for something. Standing behind her daughter with the same offended look was a rich young man known to Pyotr Ivanovich, a judicial investigator, her fiancé, as he heard. He bowed dejectedly to them and was about to go into the dead man's room, when from under the stairs appeared the figure of a schoolboy-son, terribly resembling Ivan Ilyich. It was little Ivan Ilyich, as Pyotr Ivanovich remembered him in Jurisprudence. His eyes were both tear-stained and the kind that unclean boys have at thirteen or fourteen. The boy, seeing Pyotr Ivanovich, began to frown sternly and bashfully. Pyotr Ivanovich nodded his head to him and entered the dead man's room. A memorial service began - candles, groans, incense, tears, sobs. Pyotr Ivanovich stood frowning, looking at his feet in front of him. He did not look even once at the dead man and did not succumb to the relaxing influences to the end and was one of the first to leave. There was no one in the front. Gerasim, the pantry muzhik, rushed out of the dead man's room, flung all the fur coats over with his strong hands in order to find Pyotr Ivanovich's fur coat, and handed it over.","In the dining room with the clock that Ivan Ilyich had been so pleased to buy in a junk shop, Pyotr Ivanovich met the priest and also a few acquaintances who had come to the requiem, and he saw a beautiful young lady he knew, Ivan Ilyich’s daughter. She was all in black. That made her very slender waist seem even more so. She had a somber, decisive, almost angry expression. She bowed to Pyotr Ivanovich as if he had done something wrong. Behind the daughter, with a similarly offended expression, stood a rich young man whom Pyotr Ivanovich knew, an examining magistrate who he’d heard was her fiancé. He glumly bowed to them and was about to go on into the room where the dead man lay when from under the stairs there appeared the figure of the son, a gymnasium student, who looked terribly like Ivan Ilyich. He was a little Ivan Ilyich just as Pyotr Ivanovich remembered him at law school. His eyes were tearstained and had the look that the eyes of boys with impure thoughts have at the age of thirteen or fourteen. When he recognized Pyotr Ivanovich the boy began to scowl sullenly and shamefacedly. Pyotr Ivanovich nodded to him and went into the dead man’s room. The requiem began—candles, groans, incense, tears, sobs. Pyotr Ivanovich stood frowning, looking at the feet in front of him. He didn’t look once at the dead man and right until the end didn’t give in to any depressing influences. He was one of the first to leave. There was no one in the hall. Gerasim, the peasant manservant, darted out of the dead man’s study, rummaged with his strong hands among all the fur coats to find Pyotr Ivanovich’s, and gave it to him.","In the dining-room with the clock that Ivan Ilyich had prided himself on having acquired in an antique shop, Pyotr Ivanovich came across a priest and a number of people that he knew, here for the funeral, and he saw a pretty young lady whom he also knew, Ivan Ilyich’s daughter. She was all in black. Her tiny waist looked tinier than ever. She looked gloomy, assertive, almost truculent. She bowed to Pyotr Ivanovich in a way that suggested he was to blame for something. Behind the daughter stood a wealthy young man, also known to Pyotr Ivanovich, who looked no less offended — he was an examining magistrate, her fiancé by all accounts. Pyotr Ivanovich gave a gloomy bow in their direction and was about to walk through into the dead man’s room when Ivan Ilyich’s schoolboy son, the image of his father, appeared from behind the stairwell. This was the little Ivan Ilyich that Pyotr Ivanovich remembered from law school. His tear-filled eyes were those of a twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy who has lost his innocence. Seeing Pyotr Ivanovich, he looked embarrassed and scowled morosely. Pyotr Ivanovich gave him a nod and walked into the dead man’s room. The funeral service was soon under way — candles, moaning, incense, tears, sobbing. Pyotr Ivanovich stood there with a frown on his face, staring at the legs of those in front of him. Not once did he look at the dead man or succumb to any feelings of weakness; he was one of the first to leave. There was no one in the hall. Gerasim, the servant of peasant stock, darted out of the dead man’s room, and sorted through all the fur coats with his big strong hands before finding Pyotr Ivanovich’s coat and handing it over.","In the dining-room where the clock stood that Ivan Ilych had liked so much and had bought at an antique shop, Peter Ivanovich met a priest and a few acquaintances who had come to attend the service, and he recognized Ivan Ilych’s daughter, a handsome young woman. She was in black and her slim figure appeared slimmer than ever. She had a gloomy, determined, almost angry expression, and bowed to Peter Ivanovich as though he were in some way to blame. Behind her, with the same offended look, stood a wealthy young man, an examining magistrate, whom Peter Ivanovich also knew and who was her fiance, as he had heard. He bowed mournfully to them and was about to pass into the death-chamber, when from under the stairs appeared the figure of Ivan Ilych’s schoolboy son, who was extremely like his father. He seemed a little Ivan Ilych, such as Peter Ivanovich remembered when they studied law together. His tear-stained eyes had in them the look that is seen in the eyes of boys of thirteen or fourteen who are not pure-minded. When he saw Peter Ivanovich he scowled morosely and shamefacedly. Peter Ivanovich nodded to him and entered the death-chamber. The service began: candles, groans, incense, tears, and sobs. Peter Ivanovich stood looking gloomily down at his feet. He did not look once at the dead man, did not yield to any depressing influence, and was one of the first to leave the room. There was no one in the anteroom, but Gerasim darted out of the dead man’s room, rummaged with his strong hands among the fur coats to find Peter Ivanovich’s and helped him on with it."

On his return Ivan Ilyich walked into his study and found his brother-in-law already there, a strong, fit young man, busy unpacking his own suitcase. He looked up when he heard Ivan Ilyich approaching and stared at him in silence for a moment. That stare told Ivan Ilyich everything. His brother-in-law opened his mouth to exclaim, but managed to restrain himself. That movement confirmed everything.","So one month passed and then another. Just before the New Year his brother-inlaw came to town and stayed at their house. Ivan Ilych was at the law courts and Praskovya Fedorovna had gone shopping. When Ivan Ilych came home and entered his study he found his brother-inlaw there — a healthy, florid man — unpacking his portmanteau himself. He raised his head on hearing Ivan Ilych’s footsteps and looked up at him for a moment without a word. That stare told Ivan Ilych everything. His brother-inlaw opened his mouth to utter an exclamation of surprise but checked himself, and that action confirmed it all."

"— Курите, пожалуйста, — сказала она великодушным и вместе убитым голосом и занялась с Соколовым вопросом о цене места.

"Прасковья Федоровна во всех случавшихся невзгодах в этом новом месте жительства упрекала мужа. Большинство предметов разговора между мужем и женой, особенно воспитание детей, наводило на вопросы, по которым были воспоминания ссор, и ссоры всякую минуту готовы были разгораться. Оставались только те редкие периоды влюбленности, которые находили на супругов, но продолжались недолго. Это были островки, на которые они приставали на время, но потом опять пускались в море затаенной вражды, выражавшейся в отчуждении друг от друга. Отчуждение это могло бы огорчать Ивана Ильича, если бы он считал, что это не должно так быть, но он теперь уже признавал это положение не только нормальным, но и целью всей деятельности в семье. Цель его состояла в том, чтобы все больше и больше освобождать себя от этих неприятностей и придать им характер безвредности и приличия; и он достигал этого тем, что он все меньше и меньше проводил время с семьею, а когда был вынужден это делать, то старался обеспечивать свое положение присутствием посторонних лиц. Главное же то, что у Ивана Ильича была служба. В служебном мире сосредоточился для него весь интерес жизни. И интерес этот поглощал его. Сознание своей власти, возможности погубить всякого человека, которого он захочет погубить, важность, даже внешняя, при его входе в суд и встречах с подчиненными, успех свой перед высшими и подчиненными и, главное, мастерство свое ведения дел, которое он чувствовал, — все это радовало его и вместе с беседами с товарищами, обедами и вистом наполняло его жизнь. Так что вообще жизнь Ивана Ильича продолжала идти так, как он считал, что она должна была идти: приятно и прилично.","Praskovya Fyodorovna reproached her husband for all the hardships that happened in this new place of residence. Most of the subjects of conversation between husband and wife, especially the upbringing of children, led to questions on which there were memories of quarrels, and quarrels were ready to flare up at any moment. Only those rare periods of love remained, which were found on the spouses, but did not last long. These were islands on which they landed for a while, but then again set off in a sea of hidden enmity, expressed in alienation from each other. This estrangement might have upset Ivan Ilyich if he had thought that it should not be so, but he now already recognized this situation not only as normal, but also as the goal of all activity in the family. His object was to free himself more and more from these troubles and to give them a character of harmlessness and propriety; and he achieved this by spending less and less time with his family, and when he was forced to do so, he tried to secure his position by the presence of strangers. The main thing is that Ivan Ilyich had a service. In the service world, all the interest of life was concentrated for him. And this interest consumed him. Consciousness of his power, the possibility of destroying any person whom he wants to destroy, importance, even external, at his entrance to the court and meetings with subordinates, his success in front of superiors and subordinates, and, most importantly, the skill of his conduct of affairs, which he felt - all this pleased him and, together with conversations with comrades, dinners and whist, filled his life. So, in general, Ivan Ilyich's life continued to go on as he believed that it should have gone on: pleasantly and decently.","Praskovya Fyodorovna blamed her husband for all the misfortunes that befell them in their new home. Most subjects of conversation between husband and wife, particularly the education of the children, led to questions that recalled past disputes, and quarrels were ready to break out at every minute. There remained only rare periods of tenderness that came to the married couple but did not last long. These were islands on which they landed for a while but then again sailed off into the sea of hidden animosity which expressed itself in their alienation from each other. This alienation might have distressed Ivan Ilyich if he had thought that it should not be like this, but he now recognized this situation not just as normal but as the actual goal of his family life. His object was to free himself more and more from these unpleasant things and to give them a character of innocuous decorum; he achieved it by spending less and less time with his family and when he was forced to do it, he tried to protect his situation by the presence of outsiders. The important thing was that Ivan Ilyich had his official work. For him all the interest of life was concentrated in that official world, and this interest absorbed him. The consciousness of his power, of his ability to bring down anyone he chose to, his importance, even in externals when he entered the court and at meetings with subordinates, his mastery of conducting the work—all this made him feel glad, and together with talking to his friends, with dinners and vint, it filled up his life. So overall Ivan Ilyich’s life continued to go on as he thought that it should: pleasantly and with decorum.","Praskovya blamed her husband for all the setbacks they were suffering in their new place of residence. Most of the topics of conversation between husband and wife, especially about bringing up the children, led to questions that reminded them of past arguments, and new arguments were liable to flare up at any moment. They were left with a few short periods of amorousness that came over them as husband and wife, but these did not last long. These were nothing more than little islands where they could anchor for a while, only to plunge back into a sea of hidden hostility as they grew further and further apart. This growing apart might have upset Ivan Ilyich if he had thought there was anything wrong with it, but now not only did he consider this state of affairs to be quite normal, he saw it as the whole point of his role in the family. His role was to distance himself increasingly from all the unpleasantness and give it an air of harmless respectability; this he achieved by spending less and less time with the family, and when he was forced to be with them he sought to safeguard his own position by ensuring the presence of others. But the main thing was that Ivan Ilyich did have his work. It was in the world of his work that the whole interest of his life came into focus. And this interest absorbed him totally. The knowledge of the power that he wielded, the possibility of ruining anyone that he fancied ruining, the gravitas (even if it was all outward show) which could be sensed as he walked into court or dealt with his subordinates, the success that he was enjoying with his superiors and subordinates alike, and, above all, his masterly handling of the cases — all of this gave him pleasure, and, along with chitchat with colleagues, dinners and whist, filled his life to the full. And so, life in general proceeded for Ivan Ilyich just as he thought it should proceed — pleasantly and respectably.","Praskovya Fedorovna blamed her husband for every inconvenience they encountered in their new home. Most of the conversations between husband and wife, especially as to the children’s education, led to topics which recalled former disputes, and these disputes were apt to flare up again at any moment. There remained only those rare periods of amorousness which still came to them at times but did not last long. These were islets at which they anchored for a while and then again set out upon that ocean of veiled hostility which showed itself in their aloofness from one another. This aloofness might have grieved Ivan Ilych had he considered that it ought not to exist, but he now regarded the position as normal, and even made it the goal at which he aimed in family life. His aim was to free himself more and more from those unpleasantness and to give them a semblance of harmlessness and propriety. He attained this by spending less and less time with his family, and when obliged to be at home he tried to safeguard his position by the presence of outsiders. The chief thing however was that he had his official duties. The whole interest of his life now centered in the official world and that interest absorbed him. The consciousness of his power, being able to ruin anybody he wished to ruin, the importance, even the external dignity of his entry into court, or meetings with his subordinates, his success with superiors and inferiors, and above all his masterly handling of cases, of which he was conscious — all this gave him pleasure and filled his life, together with chats with his colleagues, dinners, and bridge. So that on the whole Ivan Ilych’s life continued to flow as he considered it should do — pleasantly and properly."

"Иван Ильич вернулся в деревню веселый, довольный, каким он давно не был. Прасковья Федоровна тоже повеселела, и между ними заключилось перемирие. Иван Ильич рассказывал о том, как его все чествовали в Петербурге, как все те, которые были его врагами, были посрамлены и подличали теперь перед ним, как ему завидуют за его положение, в особенности о том, как все его сильно любили в Петербурге.","Ivan Ilyich returned to the village cheerful and content, as he had not been for a long time.

"Мысль о страдании человека, которого он знал так близко, сначала веселым мальчиком, школьником, потом взрослым партнером, несмотря на неприятное сознание притворства своего и этой женщины, вдруг ужаснула Петра Ивановича. Он увидал опять этот лоб, нажимавший на губу нос, и ему стало страшно за себя.","The thought of the suffering of a man whom he knew so intimately, first as a merry boy, a schoolboy, then as an adult partner, in spite of the unpleasant awareness of the pretense of his own and this woman, suddenly horrified Pyotr Ivanovich.

"И он не мог понять и старался отогнать эту мысль, как ложную, неправильную, болезненную, и вытеснить ее другими, правильными, здоровыми мыслями. Но мысль эта, не только мысль, но как будто действительность, приходила опять и становилась перед ним.","And he could not understand and tried to drive away this thought as false, wrong, painful, and to force it out with other, correct, healthy thoughts.

"Потом ему приходила мысль весь этот etablissement[7] с альбомами переместить в другой угол, к цветам. Он звал лакея: или дочь, или жена приходили на помощь; они не соглашались, противоречили, он спорил, сердился; но все было хорошо, потому что он не помнил о ней, ее не видно было.","Then the idea came to him to move this whole etablissement[7] with the albums to another corner, to the flowers.

"Самый процесс женитьбы и первое время брачной жизни, с супружескими ласками, новой мебелью, новой посудой, новым бельем, до беременности жены прошло очень хорошо, так что Иван Ильич начинал уже думать, что женитьба не только не нарушит того характера жизни легкой, приятной, веселой и всегда приличной и одобряемой обществом, который Иван Ильич считал свойственным жизни вообще, но еще усугубит его. Но тут, с первых месяцев беременности жены, явилось что-то такое новое, неожиданное, неприятное, тяжелое и неприличное, чего нельзя было ожидать и от чего никак нельзя было отделаться.","The very process of marriage and the first time of married life, with marital caresses, new furniture, new dishes, new linen, went very well before the wife's pregnancy, so that Ivan Ilyich was already beginning to think that marriage would not only not disturb that character of life, easy, pleasant, cheerful and always decent and approved by society, which Ivan Ilyich considered characteristic of life in general, but would still aggravate it. But then, from the first months of his wife's pregnancy, something new, unexpected, unpleasant, heavy and indecent appeared, which could not be expected and from which it was impossible to get rid of.","The actual process of marriage and the first period of married life, with its conjugal caresses, new furniture, new china, and new linen, went very well until his wife’s pregnancy, so that Ivan Ilyich was beginning to think that marriage not only would not destroy the character of an easy, pleasant, cheerful life, one wholly decorous and approved of by society, which Ivan Ilyich thought the true quality of life, but would enhance it further. But then from the first months of his wife’s pregnancy something new appeared, something unexpected, unpleasant, oppressive, and indecorous that one couldn’t expect and from which one couldn’t escape.","The process of getting married, and the early days of married life, with conjugal caresses, new furniture, new crockery, new linen, everything up to his wife’s pregnancy, went very smoothly, to the extent that Ivan Ilyich was beginning to think that marriage would not disrupt his easy, agreeable and enjoyable lifestyle, which was decency itself, approved of by society and something that Ivan Ilyich considered to be part of life itself — and it might even improve it. But it was at this stage, during the first months of his wife’s pregnancy, that something happened, something new, unexpected, unpleasant, difficult and disgusting, something that could not have been anticipated and could not in any way be got rid of.","The preparations for marriage and the beginning of married life, with its conjugal caresses, the new furniture, new crockery, and new linen, were very pleasant until his wife became pregnant — so that Ivan Ilych had begun to think that marriage would not impair the easy, agreeable, gay and always decorous character of his life, approved of by society and regarded by himself as natural, but would even improve it. But from the first months of his wife’s pregnancy, something new, unpleasant, depressing, and unseemly, and from which there was no way of escape, unexpectedly showed itself."

"Была одна штучка, маленькая штучка в слепой кишке. Все это могло поправиться. Усилить энергию одного органа, ослабить деятельность другого, произойдет всасывание, и все поправится. Он немного опоздал к обеду. Пообедал, весело поговорил, но долго не мог уйти к себе заниматься. Наконец он пошел в кабинет и тотчас же сел за работу. Он читал дела, работал, но сознание того, что у него есть отложенное важное задушевное дело, которым он займется по окончании, не оставляло его. Когда он кончил дела, он вспомнил, что это задушевное дело были мысли о слепой кишке. Но он не предался им, он пошел в гостиную к чаю. Были гости, говорили и играли на фортепиано, пели; был судебный следователь, желанный жених у дочери. Иван Ильич провел вечер, по замечанию Прасковьи Федоровны, веселее других, но он не забывал ни на минуту, что у него есть отложенные важные мысли о слепой кишке. В одиннадцать часов он простился и пошел к себе. Он спал один со времени своей болезни, в маленькой комнатке у кабинета. Он пошел, разделся и взял роман Золя, но не читал его, а думал. И в его воображении происходило то желанное исправление слепой кишки. Всасывалось, выбрасывалось, восстановлялась правильная деятельность. «Да, это все так, — сказал он себе. — Только надо помогать природе». Он вспомнил о лекарствах, приподнялся, принял его, лег на спину, прислушиваясь к тому, как благотворно действует лекарство и как оно уничтожает боль. «Только равномерно принимать и избегать вредных влияний; я уже теперь чувствую несколько лучше, гораздо лучше». Он стал щупать бок, — на ощупь не больно. «Да, я не чувствую, право, уже гораздо лучше». Он потушил свечу и лег на бок… Слепая кишка исправляется, всасывается. Вдруг он почувствовал знакомую старую, глухую, ноющую боль, упорную, тихую, серьезную. Во рту та же знакомая гадость. Засосало сердце, помутилось в голове. «Боже мой, Боже мой! — проговорил он. — Опять, опять, и никогда не перестанет». И вдруг ему дело представилось совсем с другой стороны. «Слепая кишка? Почка, — сказал он себе. — Не в слепой кишке, не в почке дело, а в жизни и… смерти. Да, жизнь была и вот уходит, уходит, и я не могу удержать ее. Да. Зачем обманывать себя? Разве не очевидно всем, кроме меня, что я умираю, и вопрос только в числе недель, дней — сейчас, может быть. То свет был, а теперь мрак. То я здесь был, а теперь туда! Куда?» Его обдало холодом, дыхание остановилось. Он слышал только удары сердца.","There was one thing, a little thing in the caecum. All of this could improve. Strengthen the energy of one organ, weaken the activity of another, absorption will occur, and everything will get better. He was a little late for dinner. I dined, talked merrily, but for a long time I could not go to my place to study. Finally he went to his study and immediately sat down to work. He read cases, worked, but the consciousness that he had a postponed important sincere business, which he would deal with after completion, did not leave him. When he finished his business, he remembered that this heartfelt matter was thoughts about the caecum. But he did not give in to them; he went into the drawing-room for tea. There were guests, they spoke and played the piano, they sang; there was an examining magistrate, the daughter's desired fiance. Ivan Ilyich spent the evening, according to Praskovya Fyodorovna, more cheerfully than others, but he did not forget for a moment that he had important thoughts about the caecum put aside. At eleven o'clock he said goodbye and went to his room. He had slept alone ever since his illness, in a small room by the study. He went, undressed and took Zola's novel, but did not read it, but thought. And in his imagination that desired correction of the caecum was taking place. It was sucked in, thrown out, correct activity was restored. Yes, that's right, he told himself. “We just need to help nature.” He remembered the medicine, got up, took it, lay on his back, listening to how the medicine works beneficially and how it destroys the pain. “Only accept evenly and avoid harmful influences; I already feel a little better now, much better.” He began to feel the side - it does not hurt to the touch. “Yes, I don’t feel, really, it’s already much better.” He put out the candle and lay down on his side... The caecum is being corrected, absorbed. Suddenly he felt a familiar old, dull, aching pain, stubborn, quiet, serious. In the mouth, the same familiar muck. Sucked in the heart, confused in the head. “My God, my God! he said. “Again, again, and never stop.” And suddenly he saw things from a completely different angle. ""Cecum? Kidney, he told himself. “It’s not about the caecum, it’s not about the kidney, it’s about life and… death.” Yes, life was and now it is leaving, leaving, and I cannot keep it. Yes. Why deceive yourself? Isn't it obvious to everyone but me that I'm dying, and the only question is the number of weeks, days - now, maybe. There was light, but now there is darkness. I was here, and now there! Where?"" He was cold, his breathing stopped. He heard only heartbeats.","There was something, a little something in the appendix. All that might be put right. Stimulate the activity of one organ, weaken the activity of another; the something would be absorbed and everything would be put right. He got back a little late for dinner, talked cheerfully for a bit, but for a long time he couldn’t go to his room to work. Finally he went into his study and at once sat down to work. He read his cases and worked, but the consciousness that he had set something aside—an important and intimate matter which he would take up once his work was over—did not leave him. When he had finished his cases, he remembered that this intimate matter was his thinking about his appendix. But he didn’t indulge it; he went to the drawing room for tea. There were guests, including the examining magistrate, his daughter’s intended; they talked and played the piano and sang. Ivan Ilyich spent the evening, as Praskovya Fyodorovna noticed, more cheerfully than he had spent others, but he didn’t forget for one minute that he had set aside some important thinking about his appendix. At eleven o’clock he said goodnight and went to his room. Since he had become ill he slept in a little room next to his study. He went in, undressed, and picked up a novel of Zola’s, which he didn’t read. He began thinking instead. The desired cure of the appendix took place in his imagination. Matter was absorbed, matter was expelled, and normal activity was restored. “Yes, that’s how it all is,” he said to himself. “Only nature needs a little help.” He remembered his medicine, sat up, took it, watching for the beneficial effects of the medicine and the removal of the pain. “Just take it regularly and avoid unhealthy influences; I already feel a bit better, much better.” He started to feel his side—it wasn’t painful to the touch. “Yes, I can’t feel it; I’m really much better now.” He put out the candle and lay on his side. “The appendix is getting better; things are being absorbed.” Suddenly he felt the familiar old dull nagging pain, the persistent, quiet, serious pain. The familiar nastiness in his mouth. His heart began to pump, his head turned. “My God, my God!” he said. “It’s here again, it’s here again and it’s never going to stop.” And suddenly his case presented itself to him from a different perspective. “Appendix! Kidney!” he said to himself. “It’s not a case of the appendix or of the kidney, but of life . . . and death. Yes, I had life and now it’s passing, passing, and I can’t hold it back. That’s it. Why deceive oneself? Isn’t it obvious to everyone but myself that I am dying, and it’s only a question of the number of weeks, days—maybe now. There was light and now there’s darkness. I was here but now I’m going there! Where?” A chill came over him, his breathing stopped. He could only hear the beating of his heart.","There was a little bit of something, a tiny little thing, in his blind gut. It could all be put right. By raising the energy level in one organ and lowering the activity of another, absorption could be achieved and everything would be all right. He was a little late for dinner. He talked cheerfully after dinner, but for some time he couldn’t bring himself to go to his room and work. Eventually he did go off to his study and he got straight down to it. He worked at the files for a while, but he couldn’t shrug off the awareness that he had some important unfinished personal business that would have to be attended to in the end. When he had finished the files he remembered that this personal business meant thinking about his gut. But instead of giving in to this he went to take tea in the drawing-room. They had guests - there was conversation, piano-playing and singing - and among them was the examining magistrate who was such a good match for his daughter. As Praskovya remarked, he enjoyed the evening more than usual, but never for a minute did he forget that he had some important unfinished thinking to do, about his gut. At eleven o‘clock he said goodnight and went to his room. He had been sleeping alone since his illness began, in a tiny little room next to his study. He went in, undressed and took up a Zola novel, but instead of reading it he lapsed into thought. And in his imagination the longed-for healing of his blind gut took place; absorption was followed by evacuation and its proper function was restored. ‘Yes, that’s how it goes,’ he said to himself. ‘All you have to do is give nature a helping hand.’ He remembered his medicine, eased himself up and took it, then lay on his back focusing on the good that the medicine was doing and the way it was getting rid of the pain. ‘ Keep taking it regularly and avoid anything harmful. I feel a bit better already, a lot better.’ He felt his side - no pain to the touch. ‘ No, there’s no feeling there. It really is getting a lot better.’ He put out the candle and lay on his side ... Absorption; the blind gut was curing itself. Then suddenly he could feel the same old dull gnawing pain, quiet, serious, unrelenting. The same nasty taste in his mouth. His heart sank and his head swam. ‘ O God! O God!’ he muttered. ‘It’s here again, and it’s not going away.’ And suddenly he saw things from a completely different angle. ‘The blind gut! The kidney!’ he said to himself. ‘It’s got nothing to do with the blind gut or the kidney. It’s a matter of living or ... dying. Yes, I have been alive, and now my life is steadily going away and I can’t stop it. No. There’s no point in fooling myself. Can’t they all see - everybody but me - that I’m dying? It’s only a matter of weeks, or days - maybe any minute now. There has been daylight; now there is darkness. I have been here; now I’m going there. Where?’ A cold shiver ran over him; he stopped breathing. He could hear nothing but the beating of his heart.","There was something, a small thing, in the vermiform appendix. It might all come right. Only stimulate the energy of one organ and check the activity of another, then absorption would take place and everything would come right. He got home rather late for dinner, ate his dinner, and conversed cheerfully, but could not for a long time bring himself to go back to work in his room. At last, however, he went to his study and did what was necessary, but the consciousness that he had put something aside — an important, intimate matter which he would revert to when his work was done — never left him. When he had finished his work he remembered that this intimate matter was the thought of his vermiform appendix. But he did not give himself up to it, and went to the drawing-room for tea. There were callers there, including the examining magistrate who was a desirable match for his daughter, and they were conversing, playing the piano, and singing. Ivan Ilych, as Praskovya Fedorovna remarked, spent that evening more cheerfully than usual, but he never for a moment forgot that he had postponed the important matter of the appendix. At eleven o’clock he said goodnight and went to his bedroom. Since his illness he had slept alone in a small room next to his study. He undressed and took up a novel by Zola, but instead of reading it he fell into thought, and in his imagination that desired improvement in the vermiform appendix occurred. There was the absorption and evacuation and the reestablishment of normal activity. “Yes, that’s it!” he said to himself. “One need only assist nature, that’s all.” He remembered his medicine, rose, took it, and lay down on his back watching for the beneficent action of the medicine and for it to lessen the pain. “I need only take it regularly and avoid all injurious influences. I am already feeling better, much better.” He began touching his side: it was not painful to the touch. “There, I really don’t feel it. It’s much better already.” He put out the light and turned on his side... “The appendix is getting better, absorption is occurring.” Suddenly he felt the old, familiar, dull, gnawing pain, stubborn and serious. There was the same familiar loathsome taste in his mouth. His heart sand and he felt dazed. “My God! My God!” he muttered. “Again, again! And it will never cease.” And suddenly the matter presented itself in a quite different aspect. “Vermiform appendix! Kidney!” he said to himself. “It’s not a question of appendix or kidney, but of life and... death. Yes, life was there and now it is going, going and I cannot stop it. Yes. Why deceive myself? Isn’t it obvious to everyone but me that I’m dying, and that it’s only a question of weeks, days... it may happen this moment. There was light and now there is darkness. I was here and now I’m going there! Where?” A chill came over him, his breathing ceased, and he felt only the throbbing of his heart."
"— Я все сама делаю, — сказала она Петру Ивановичу, отодвигая к одной стороне альбомы, лежавшие на столе; и, заметив, что пепел угрожал столу, не мешкая подвинула Петру Ивановичу пепельницу и проговорила: — Я нахожу притворством уверять, что я не могу от горя заниматься практическими делами. Меня, напротив, если может что не утешить… а развлечь, то это — заботы о нем же. — Она опять достала платок, как бы собираясь плакать, и вдруг, как бы пересиливая себя, встряхнулась и стала говорить спокойно:","""I do everything myself,"" she said to Pyotr Ivanovich, pushing the albums that lay on the table to one side; and, noticing that the ashes were threatening the table, she moved the ashtray to Pyotr Ivanovich without delay and said: “I find it pretense to assure that I cannot, from grief, deal with practical matters. On the contrary, if anything can not console me ... but entertain, then this is concern for him. She again took out her handkerchief, as if about to cry, and suddenly, as if overpowering herself, she shook herself and began to speak calmly:","“I do everything myself,” she said to Pyotr Ivanovich, moving some albums lying on the table to one side. Noticing that his ash was posing a threat to the table, she speedily pushed an ashtray towards Pyotr Ivanovich and said, “I find it a pretence to state that because of grief I can’t deal with practical matters. On the contrary, if there is something that can . . . not console . . . but distract me, then it’s bothering about him.” She again took out her handkerchief as if she were going to cry, and suddenly, as if pulling herself together, she shook herself and began to speak quietly:","‘I’m doing everything myself,’ she told Pyotr Ivanovich, pushing aside some albums on the table. Noticing that the table was under threat from the cigarette, she swiftly moved an ashtray across and spoke again. ‘I think it would be hypocritical to claim that I cannot manage practicalities because of my grief. On the contrary, if anything can ... I won’t say console me, but ... take my mind off things, it’s seeing to what has to be done about him.’ She took out her handkerchief again as if on the verge of tears, but suddenly she seemed to get a grip on her feelings, snapped out of it and spoke calmly.","“I look after everything myself,” she told Peter Ivanovich, shifting the albums that lay on the table; and noticing that the table was endangered by his cigarette-ash, she immediately passed him an ash-tray, saying as she did so: “I consider it an affectation to say that my grief prevents my attending to practical affairs. On the contrary, if anything can — I won’t say console me, but — distract me, it is seeing to everything concerning him.” She again took out her handkerchief as if preparing to cry, but suddenly, as if mastering her feeling, she shook herself and began to speak calmly."
"И чем дальше от детства, чем ближе к настоящему, тем ничтожнее и сомнительнее были радости. Начиналось это с Правоведения. Там было еще кое-что истинно хорошее: там было веселье, там была дружба, там были надежды. Но в высших классах уже были реже эти хорошие минуты. Потом, во время первой службы у губернатора, опять появились хорошие минуты: это были воспоминания о любви к женщине. Потом все это смешалось, и еще меньше стало хорошего. Далее еще меньше хорошего, и что дальше, то меньше.","And the farther from childhood, the closer to the present, the more insignificant and doubtful were the joys. It started with jurisprudence. There was something else that was truly good: there was fun, there was friendship, there was hope. But in the upper classes those good moments were already rarer. Then, during the first service with the governor, good moments again appeared: these were memories of love for a woman. Then it all got mixed up, and there was even less good stuff. Further, even less good, and what is further, then less.","And the further from childhood, the nearer to the present, the more worthless and dubious were the joys. That began with law school.

After that, at the time of his first period of service with the governor, again good moments appeared: there were memories of love for a woman. After that all this became confused and there was even less of what was good.

But in the last years the good times had become more exceptional. Then, at the beginning of his service with the governor, some good times came again: memories of making love to a woman. Then it became all confused, and the good times were not so many. After that there were fewer still; the further he went the fewer there were.","And the further he departed from childhood and the nearer he came to the present the more worthless and doubtful were the joys.

"— Ну что ж, — сказал он. — Может быть, и точно ничего еще.","“Well then,” he said. “Maybe, and definitely nothing else.","“Well then,” he said. “Perhaps it’s not so bad.”","‘Oh well,’ he said. ‘ Maybe that’s right. Nothing to worry about just now ...’","“Well,” he thought, “perhaps it isn’t so bad after all.”"
