– Туз выиграл! – сказал Германн и открыл свою карту.,- Ace won! Hermann said and opened his card.,"‘Ace wins!’ said Hermann, and showed his card.","“My ace wins!” said Hermann, turning his card."
"– Я пришла к тебе против своей воли, – сказала она твёрдым голосом, – но мне велено исполнить твою просьбу. Тройка, семёрка и туз выиграют тебе сряду, – но с тем, чтобы ты в сутки более одной карты не ставил и чтоб во всю жизнь уже после не играл. Прощаю тебе мою смерть, с тем, чтоб ты женился на моей воспитаннице Лизавете Ивановне...","“I came to you against my will,” she said in a firm voice, “but I am ordered to fulfill your request.

I forgive you my death, so that you marry my pupil Lizaveta Ivanovna ...","‘I have come to you against my will,’ she said in a firm voice: ‘but I am commanded to grant your request. The three, the seven and the ace will win for you if you play them in succession, provided that you do not stake more than one card in twenty-four hours and never play again as long as you live. I forgive you my death, on condition that you marry my ward, Lizaveta Ivanovna.’","“I have come to you against my will,” she said in a firm voice, “but I am directed to grant your request.

"В это время кто-то с улицы заглянул к нему в окошко, – и тотчас отошёл. Германн не обратил на то никакого внимания. Чрез минуту услышал он, что отпирали дверь в передней комнате. Германн думал, что денщик его, пьяный по своему обыкновению, возвращался с ночной прогулки. Но он услышал незнакомую походку: кто-то ходил, тихо шаркая туфлями. Дверь отворилась, вошла женщина в белом платье. Германн принял её за свою старую кормилицу и удивился, что могло привести её в такую пору. Но белая женщина, скользнув, очутилась вдруг перед ним, – и Германн узнал графиню!","At this time, someone from the street looked into his window - and immediately walked away. Hermann paid no attention to that. A minute later he heard the door in the front room being unlocked. Hermann thought that his orderly, drunk as usual, was returning from a night walk. But he heard an unfamiliar gait: someone was walking, quietly shuffling his shoes. The door opened and a woman in a white dress entered. Hermann mistook her for his old nurse and wondered what could have brought her at such a time. But the white woman, slipping, suddenly found herself in front of him - and Hermann recognized the countess!","Just then someone in the street looked in at him through the window and immediately walked on. Hermann paid no attention. A moment later he heard the door of his ante-room open. Hermann thought it was his orderly, drunk as usual, returning from some nocturnal excursion, but presently he heard an unfamiliar footstep: someone was softly shuffling along the floor in slippers. The door opened and a woman in white came in. Hermann mistook her for his old nurse and wondered what could have brought her at such an hour. But the woman in white glided across the room and stood before him – and Hermann recognized the countess!","Just then someone glanced in at him through the window, and immediately went away again. Hermann ignored this. A minute later he heard the outer door opening. Hermann assumed that his orderly, drunk as usual, was coming back home from a night out. But then he heard unfamiliar footsteps, someone shuffling up in soft shoes. The door opened; in came a woman in a white dress. Hermann mistook her for his old nurse, and he wondered what could have brought her here at this late hour. But the woman in white slipped inside and stood before him. Hermann recognized the Countess!"
"Между игроками поднялся шёпот. Чекалинский нахмурился, но улыбка тотчас возвратилась на его лицо.","There was a whisper among the players. Chekalinsky frowned, but the smile immediately returned to his face.","There was a murmur of astonishment among the company. Tchekalinsky frowned, but the smile quickly reappeared on his face.","A murmur ran through the gamblers. Chekalinsky gave a frown, though the smile was immediately back on his face."
"Чекалинский потянул к себе проигранные билеты. Германн стоял неподвижно. Когда отошёл он от стола, поднялся шумный говор. – Славно спонтировал! – говорили игроки. – Чекалинский снова стасовал карты: игра пошла своим чередом.","Chekalinsky pulled the lost tickets towards him. Hermann stood motionless. When he moved away from the table, a noisy conversation arose. - Well sponsored! the players said. - Chekalinsky shuffled the cards again: the game went on as usual.","Tchekalinsky gathered up his winnings. Hermann stood rooted to the spot. When he left the table every one began talking at once. ‘A fine game, that!’ said the players. Tchekalinsky shuffled the cards afresh and the game resumed as usual.",Chekalinsky raked in the losing banknotes. Hermann stood there making no movement. When he did leave the table a roar of voices erupted. “Splendid game!” said the gamblers. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards again. The gambling took its normal course.
"С того времени не проходило дня, чтоб молодой человек, в известный час, не являлся под окнами их дома. Между им и ею учредились неусловленные сношения. Сидя на своём месте за работой, она чувствовала его приближение, – подымала голову, смотрела на него с каждым днём долее и долее. Молодой человек, казалось, был за то ей благодарен: она видела острым взором молодости, как быстрый румянец покрывал его бледные щёки всякий раз, когда взоры их встречались. Через неделю она ему улыбнулась...","Since that time, not a day has passed that the young man, at a certain hour, did not appear under the windows of their house. An unconditional relationship was established between him and her. Sitting in her place at work, she felt his approach - she raised her head, looked at him longer and longer every day. The young man seemed to be grateful to her for this: she saw with the sharp eyes of youth how a quick blush covered his pale cheeks every time their eyes met. A week later she smiled at him...","Since then not a day had passed without the young man appearing at a certain hour beneath the windows of their house, and between him and her a sort of mute acquaintance was established.

The young man seemed to be grateful to her for looking out: with the keen eyes of youth she saw the quick flush of his pale cheeks every time their glances met. By the end of a week she had smiled at him….","From then on, not a day passed without the young officer appearing at a fixed time in front of the windows. A relationship built up spontaneously between the two of them. As she sat there at her work she could sense him approaching; she would look up from her work and glance down at him—a little longer every day. The young man seemed to be grateful to her; with the sharp eyes of youth she could make out a rapid flush that crossed his pale cheeks every time their eyes met. Within a week she had smiled at him…"
"– И кажется, – продолжал Германн, – я причиною её смерти.","“And it seems,” continued Hermann, “I am the cause of her death.”","‘And I think’, added Hermann, ‘that I am the cause of her death.’","“And it seems,” went on Hermann, “that I was the cause of her death.”"
"Однажды играли в карты у конногвардейца Нарумова. Долгая зимняя ночь прошла незаметно; сели ужинать в пятом часу утра. Те, которые остались в выигрыше, ели с большим аппетитом; прочие, в рассеянности, сидели перед своими приборами. Но шампанское явилось, разговор оживился, и все приняли в нем участие.","Once they played cards with the horse guard Narumov.

Open the first volume and read to me.’ The girl took the book and read a few lines.","“Plenty of time, my dear. Stay where you are. Open the first volume and read to me…” The young lady opened the book and read a few lines."
"– Умерла! – сказала она, – а я и не знала! Мы вместе были пожалованы во фрейлины, и когда мы представились, то государыня...","- Died! she said, “but I didn’t know!” Together we were granted maids of honor, and when we introduced ourselves, the empress ...","‘Dead! I didn’t know,’ she said. ‘We were maids of honour together, and as we were being presented the Empress…’","“Dead?” she said, “And I didn’t know. We were appointed maids of honour at the same time, and just as we were being presented…”"
"– Вы можете, – продолжал Германн, – составить счастие моей жизни, и оно ничего не будет вам стоить: я знаю, что вы можете угадать три карты сряду...","“You can,” continued Hermann, “make up the happiness of my life, and it will not cost you anything: I know that you can guess three cards in a row ...","‘You can ensure the happiness of my whole life,’ Hermann went on, ‘and at no cost to yourself.

"Графиня стала раздеваться перед зеркалом. Откололи с неё чепец, украшенный розами; сняли напудренный парик с её седой и плотно остриженной головы. Булавки дождём сыпались около неё. Желтое платье, шитое серебром, упало к её распухшим ногам.

"Как и все старые люди вообще, графиня страдала бессонницею. Раздевшись, она села у окна в вольтеровы кресла и отослала горничных. Свечи вынесли, комната опять осветилась одною лампадою. Графиня сидела вся жёлтая, шевеля отвислыми губами, качаясь направо и налево. В мутных глазах её изображалось совершенное отсутствие мысли; смотря на неё, можно было бы подумать, что качание страшной старухи происходило не от её воли, но по действию скрытого гальванизма.","Like all old people in general, the Countess suffered from insomnia. Having undressed, she sat down at the window in the Voltaire chairs and sent the maids away. The candles were taken out, the room was again lit up with one lamp.

Her dim eyes were completely vacant and looking at her one might have imagined that the dreadful old woman was rocking her body not from choice but owing to some secret galvanic mechanism.","Like all old people, the Countess suffered from insomnia.

"Под лестницею Германн нашёл дверь, которую отпер тем же ключом, и очутился в сквозном коридоре, выведшем его на улицу.","Under the stairs, Hermann found a door, which he unlocked with the same key, and found himself in a through corridor that led him out into the street.","At the bottom of the stairs Hermann saw a door which he opened with the same key, and found himself in a passage leading to the street.","At the bottom of the stairs Hermann came to another door, which opened with the same key, and soon found himself in a passageway leading out onto the street."
"В следующий вечер Германн явился опять у стола. Все его ожидали. Генералы и тайные советники оставили свой вист, чтоб видеть игру, столь необыкновенную. Молодые офицеры соскочили с диванов; все официанты собрались в гостиной. Все обступили Германна. Прочие игроки не поставили своих карт, с нетерпением ожидая, чем он кончит. Германн стоял у стола, готовясь один понтировать противу бледного, но всё улыбающегося Чекалинского. Каждый распечатал колоду карт. Чекалинский стасовал. Германн снял и поставил свою карту, покрыв её кипой банковых билетов. Это похоже было на поединок. Глубокое молчание царствовало кругом.","The next evening Hermann appeared again at the table. Everyone was expecting him. The generals and privy councilors left their whist to see the game so extraordinary. The young officers jumped off the sofas; all the waiters gathered in the living room. Everyone surrounded Hermann. The other players didn't put in their cards, looking forward to how he would end up. Hermann stood at the table, preparing to ponte alone against the pale, but still smiling Chekalinsky. Each printed a deck of cards. Chekalinsky shuffled. Hermann removed and placed his card, covering it with a pile of bank notes. It looked like a duel. A profound silence reigned all around.","The next evening Hermann again made his appearance at the table.

"Две неподвижные идеи не могут вместе существовать в нравственной природе, так же, как два тела не могут в физическом мире занимать одно и то же место. Тройка, семёрка, туз – скоро заслонили в воображении Германна образ мёртвой старухи. Тройка, семёрка, туз – не выходили из его головы и шевелились на его губах. Увидев молодую девушку, он говорил: «Как она стройна!.. Настоящая тройка червонная». У него спрашивали: «который час», он отвечал: «без пяти минут семёрка». Всякий пузатый мужчина напоминал ему туза. Тройка, семёрка, туз – преследовали его во сне, принимая все возможные виды: тройка цвела перед ним в образе пышного грандифлора, семёрка представлялась готическими воротами, туз огромным пауком. Все мысли его слились в одну, – воспользоваться тайной, которая дорого ему стоила. Он стал думать об отставке и о путешествии. Он хотел в открытых игрецких домах Парижа вынудить клад у очарованной фортуны. Случай избавил его от хлопот.","Two fixed ideas cannot exist together in a moral nature, just as two bodies cannot occupy the same place in the physical world. Three, seven, ace - soon obscured the image of the dead old woman in Hermann's imagination. Three, seven, ace - did not leave his head and moved on his lips. Seeing a young girl, he said: “How slim she is! .. A real red three.” They asked him: “what time is it”, he answered: “five minutes to seven”. Every pot-bellied man reminded him of an ace. Three, seven, ace - pursued him in a dream, taking on all possible forms: the three bloomed in front of him in the form of a magnificent grandiflora, the seven seemed to be a Gothic gate, the ace a huge spider. All his thoughts merged into one - to take advantage of the secret, which cost him dearly. He began to think about retirement and travel. He wanted to force the treasure from an enchanted fortune in the open houses of Paris. Chance saved him the trouble.","Two idées fixes cannot co-exist in the moral world any more than two physical bodies can occupy one and the same space. ‘ The three, the seven, the ace’ soon drove all thought of the dead woman from Hermann’s mind. ‘Three, seven, ace’ were perpetually in his head and on his lips. If he saw a young girl he would say, ‘How graceful she is! A regular three of hearts!’ Asked the time, he would reply, ‘Five minutes to seven.’ Every stout man reminded him of the ace. ‘Three, seven, ace’ haunted his dreams, assuming all sorts of shapes. The three blossomed before him like a luxuriant flower, the seven took the form of a Gothic portal, and aces became gigantic spiders. His whole attention was focused on one thought: how to make use of the secret which had cost him so dear. He began to consider resigning his commission in order to go and travel abroad. In the public gambling-houses in Paris he would compel fortune to give him his magical treasure. Chance spared him the trouble.","Two fixed ideas cannot coexist in the moral world just as two bodies in the physical world cannot occupy the same space. “Three, seven, ace” soon drove the image of the dead Countess out of Hermann’s mind. “Three, seven, ace” refused to leave his head; they stayed, trembling on his lips. If he saw a young girl, he would say, “Isn’t she lovely? A real three of hearts.” If someone asked him the time he would answer, “Five to the seven.” Any corpulent man reminded him of the ace. “Three, seven, ace” pursued him even in his sleep, taking on all possible forms. Three blossomed before him in the image of a huge, showy flower; seven took on the form of a Gothic portal; the ace was a huge spider. His thoughts all came together into a single idea—how to take advantage of the secret that had cost him so much. He began to think of retiring from the army and travelling the world. He wanted to go to the public gambling halls of Paris, and wrest riches from the magical grasp of Fortune. Chance saved him the trouble."
"Германн долго не мог опомниться. Он вышел в другую комнату. Денщик его спал на полу; Германн насилу его добудился. Денщик был пьян по обыкновению: от него нельзя было добиться никакого толка. Дверь в сени была заперта. Германн возвратился в свою комнату, засветил там свечку и записал своё видение.","Hermann could not come to his senses for a long time. He went into another room. His orderly slept on the floor; Hermann woke him up by force. The batman was drunk as usual: it was impossible to get any sense out of him. The door to the vestibule was locked. Hermann returned to his room, lit a candle there, and wrote down his vision.","It was a long time before he could pull himself together and go into the next room.

"Анекдот о трёх картах сильно подействовал на его воображение и целую ночь не выходил из его головы. «Что, если, – думал он на другой день вечером, бродя по Петербургу, – что, если старая графиня откроет мне свою тайну! – или назначит мне эти три верные карты! Почему ж не попробовать счастия?.. Представиться ей, подбиться в её милость, – пожалуй, сделаться её любовником, но на это требуется время – а ей восемьдесят семь лет, – она может умереть через неделю, —да через два дня!.. Да и самый анекдот?.. Можно ли ему верить?.. Нет! расчёт, умеренность и трудолюбие: вот мои три верные карты, вот что утроит, усемерит мой капитал и доставит мне покой и независимость!»","The anecdote about the three cards had a strong effect on his imagination and the whole night did not leave his head. “What if,” he thought the next day in the evening, wandering around Petersburg, “what if the old countess reveals her secret to me! - or assign me these three correct cards! Why not try happiness? .. To introduce herself to her, to win her favor - perhaps, to become her lover, but this takes time - and she is eighty-seven years old - she can die in a week, yes, in two days! .. Yes, and the most anecdote? .. Can you believe him? .. No! calculation, moderation and diligence: these are my three true cards, this is what will triple, sevenfold my capital and bring me peace and independence!","The story of the three cards had made a powerful impression upon his imagination and it haunted his mind all night. ‘Supposing,’ he thought to himself the following evening as he wandered about Petersburg, ‘supposing the old countess were to reveal her secret to me? Or tell me the three winning cards! Why shouldn’t I try my luck?… Get introduced to her, win her favour – become her lover, perhaps. But all that would take time, and she is eighty-seven. She might be dead next week, or the day after tomorrow even!… And the story itself? Is it likely? No, economy, moderation and hard work are my three winning cards. With them I can treble my capital – increase it sevenfold and obtain for myself leisure and independence!’","The story of the three cards had really captured his imagination, and all night long he couldn’t get it out of his mind. “What if…” he kept thinking the next evening as he roamed the streets of Petersburg, “What if the old Countess were to give me her secret—tell me the three winning cards? Why not give it a go? … Get myself introduced, play up to her, maybe even become her lover? But it all takes time, and she’s eighty-seven years old , she could die within a week, or a couple of days!… Yes, and what about that story? … Is it believable?… No, my three winning cards are caution, moderation and hard work; they are what will bring me three times, seven times, my capital, and give me peace of mind and independence!”"
"Германн трепетал, как тигр, ожидая назначенного времени. В десять часов вечера он уж стоял перед домом графини. Погода была ужасная: ветер выл, мокрый снег падал хлопьями; фонари светили тускло; улицы были пусты. Изредка тянулся Ванька на тощей кляче своей, высматривая запоздалого седока. – Германн стоял в одном сюртуке, не чувствуя ни ветра, ни снега. Наконец графинину карету подали. Германн видел, как лакеи вынесли под руки сгорбленную старуху, укутанную в соболью шубу, и как вослед за нею, в холодном плаще, с головой, убранною свежими цветами, мелькнула её воспитанница. Дверцы захлопнулись. Карета тяжело покатилась по рыхлому снегу. Швейцар запер двери. Окна померкли. Германн стал ходить около опустевшего дома: он подошёл к фонарю, взглянул на часы, – было двадцать минут двенадцатого. Германн ступил на графинино крыльцо и взошёл в ярко освещенные сени. Швейцара не было. Германн взбежал по лестнице, отворил двери в переднюю и увидел слугу, спящего под лампою, в старинных, запачканных креслах. Лёгким и твёрдым шагом Германн прошёл мимо его. Зала и гостиная были темны. Лампа слабо освещала их из передней. Германн вошёл в спальню. Перед кивотом, наполненным старинными образами, теплилась золотая лампада. Полинялые штофные кресла и диваны с пуховыми подушками, с сошедшей позолотою, стояли в печальной симметрии около стен, обитых китайскими обоями. На стене висели два портрета, писанные в Париже m-me Lebrun. Один из них изображал мужчину лет сорока, румяного и полного, в светло-зелёном мундире и со звездою; другой – молодую красавицу с орлиным носом, с зачёсанными висками и с розою в пудренных волосах. По всем углам торчали фарфоровые пастушки, столовые часы работы славного Гегоу, коробочки, рулетки, веера и разные дамские игрушки, изобретённые в конце минувшего столетия вместе с Монгольфьеровым шаром и Месмеровым магнетизмом. Германн пошёл за ширмы. За ними стояла маленькая железная кровать; справа находилась дверь, ведущая в кабинет; слева, другая – в коридор. Германн её отворил, увидел узкую, витую лестницу, которая вела в комнату бедной воспитанницы... Но он воротился и вошёл в тёмный кабинет.","Hermann trembled like a tiger, waiting for the appointed time. At ten o'clock in the evening he was already standing in front of the countess's house. The weather was terrible: the wind howled, wet snow fell in flakes; the lanterns shone dimly; the streets were empty. From time to time Vanka dragged along on his skinny horse, looking out for a belated rider. - Hermann stood in one frock coat, feeling neither wind nor snow. Finally, the countess was given a carriage. Hermann saw how the lackeys carried under their arms a hunched old woman wrapped in a sable fur coat, and how her pupil flashed after her, in a cold cloak, with her head trimmed with fresh flowers. The doors slammed shut. The carriage rolled heavily on the loose snow. The porter locked the doors. The windows are dark. Hermann began to walk around the empty house: he went up to the lamp, looked at his watch - it was twenty past eleven. Hermann stepped onto the countess' porch and went up into the brightly lit vestibule. There was no porter. Hermann ran up the stairs, opened the door to the hall, and saw a servant sleeping under a lamp, in old, soiled armchairs. Hermann walked past him with a light and firm step. The hall and drawing room were dark. The lamp dimly illuminated them from the hallway. Hermann entered the bedroom. In front of the kivot, filled with ancient images, a golden lamp glowed. Faded damask armchairs and sofas with feather pillows, with gilding gone, stood in sad symmetry near the walls, upholstered in Chinese wallpaper. On the wall hung two portraits painted in Paris by m-me Lebrun. One of them depicted a man of about forty, ruddy and plump, in a light green uniform and with a star; the other is a young beauty with an aquiline nose, combed temples and a rose in her powdered hair. Porcelain shepherdesses, table clocks made by the glorious Gegow, boxes, tape measures, fans and various ladies' toys, invented at the end of the last century together with the Montgolfier ball and Mesmer magnetism, stuck out in all corners. Hermann went behind the screen. Behind them stood a small iron bed; on the right was a door leading to an office; on the left, the other - in the corridor. Hermann opened it, saw a narrow, winding staircase that led to the room of a poor pupil ... But he turned back and entered a dark office.","Hermann waited for the appointed hour like a tiger trembling for its prey. By ten o’clock in the evening he was already standing outside the countess’s house. It was a frightful night: the wind howled, wet snow fell in big flakes; the street lamps burned dimly; the streets were deserted. From time to time a sledge drawn by a sorry-looking hack passed by, the driver on the watch for a belated fare. Hermann stood there without his great-coat, feeling neither the wind nor the snow. At last the countess ’s carriage was brought round. Hermann saw the old woman wrapped in sables being lifted into the vehicle by two footmen; then Liza in a light cloak, with natural flowers in her hair, flitted by. The carriage doors banged. The vehicle rolled heavily over the wet snow. The concierge closed the street-door. The lights in the windows went out. Hermann started to walk to and fro outside the deserted house; he went up to a street-lamp and glanced at his watch: it was twenty minutes past eleven. He stood still by the lamp-post, his eyes fixed on the hand of the watch. Precisely at half past eleven Hermann walked up the steps of the house and entered the brightly lit vestibule. The concierge was not there. Hermann ran up the stairs, opened the door of the ante-room and saw a footman asleep in a soiled, old-fashioned arm-chair by the side of a lamp. With a light, firm tread Hermann passed quickly by him. The ball-room and drawing-room were in darkness but the lamp in the ante-room shed a dim light into them. Hermann entered the bedroom. Ancient icons filled the icon-stand before which burned a golden lamp. Arm-chairs upholstered in faded damask and sofas with down cushions, the tassels of which had lost their gilt, were ranged with depressing symmetry round the walls hung with Chinese wall-paper. On one of the walls were two portraits painted in Paris by Madame Lebrun: the first of a stout, red-faced man of some forty years of age, in a light-green uniform with a star on his breast; the other – a beautiful young woman with an aquiline nose and a rose in the powdered hair drawn back over her temples. Every corner was crowded with porcelain shepherdesses, clocks made by the celebrated Leroy, little boxes, roulettes, fans and all the thousand and one playthings invented for ladies of fashion at the end of the last century together with Montgolfier’s balloon and Mesmer’s magnetism. Hermann stepped behind the screen. A small iron bedstead stood there; to the right was the door into the study – to the left, the other door into the passage. Hermann opened it and saw the narrow winding staircase leading to poor little Liza’s room. But he turned about and went into the dark study.","Hermann trembled like a tiger as he waited for the appointed time. He was outside the Countess’s house by ten o’clock in the evening. The weather was foul, with a howling wind and snow falling in wet flakes. The lamps shone dimly; the streets were deserted. Now and again a cab went by, drawn by a skinny nag, with the driver on the lookout for a late-night fare. Hermann stood there without an overcoat, but insensitive to wind or snow. At last the Countess’s carriage was brought round. Hermann watched the footmen come out, half-carrying the bent old woman wrapped up warm in her sable coat, and he caught a glimpse of her young ward emerging behind her, her hair done up with fresh flowers and wearing a thin wrap. The carriage doors closed with a clunk. The vehicle trundled off over the wet snow. The porter closed the front door. The lights went out. Hermann paced up and down outside the deserted house. He went to a street lamp and looked at his watch—it said twenty minutes past eleven. He stood there under the lamp with his eyes fixed on the minute hand, waiting for the remaining time to pass. At exactly half past eleven Hermann walked up the Countess’s steps, through the porch and into the brightly lit vestibule. There was no porter. Hermann nipped up the staircase, opened a door into the hall, and saw a servant asleep under a lamp in a tatty old armchair. Hermann walked past him with a light, determined stride. The ballroom and drawing room were in darkness. A lamp in the hall gave them some dim light. Hermann entered the bedroom. A golden lamp burned before a stand covered with ancient icons. Faded brocade armchairs and sofas with fluffy cushions of worn gilt, stood in sad symmetry before walls decorated with Chinese wallpaper. On one wall there were two portraits painted in Paris by Mme Lebrun. One of them showed a man of about forty, red in the face and rather stout, wearing a bright-green uniform and a star; the other depicted a young beauty with an aquiline nose, her powdered hair combed back and set off with a rose. All the corners were noticeably adorned with porcelain shepherdesses, table clocks done by the famous Leroy, little boxes, bandalores, fans and ladies’ toys invented at the end of the last century along with the Montgolfiers’ balloon and Mesmer’s animal magnetism. Hermann went round the screen. Behind it there was a small iron bedstead; on the right was a door leading to the study, on the left another one into the passage. Hermann opened this one, and saw a narrow spiral staircase, leading up to the poor young ward’s room… But… he came back out, and walked into the dark study."

Лизавета Ивановна открыла её с беспокойством, предвидя денежные требования, и вдруг узнала руку Германна.","Three days after that, a young, quick-eyed mamzel brought a note to Lizaveta Ivanovna from a fashionable shop.

The countess said nothing. Hermann continued:,“Can you please tell me?” Hermann went on. “Tell me the three winning cards!” The Countess said nothing. Hermann went on again.

They fell silent.","‘I did not mean her to die,’ Hermann answered. ‘My pistol was not loaded.’ Both were silent.","“I didn’t mean to kill her,” replied Hermann. “The pistol wasn’t loaded.” Neither of them spoke."

"На другой день, увидя идущего Германна, Лизавета Ивановна встала из-за пяльцев, вышла в залу, отворила форточку и бросила письмо на улицу, надеясь на проворство молодого офицера. Германн подбежал, поднял его и вошёл в кондитерскую лавку. Сорвав печать, он нашёл своё письмо и ответ Лизаветы Ивановны. Он того и ожидал и возвратился домой, очень занятый своей интригою.","The next day, seeing Hermann walking, Lizaveta Ivanovna got up from her embroidery frame, went out into the hall, opened the window and threw the letter into the street, hoping for the young officer's agility.

It was just what he had expected and he returned home engrossed in his plot.","The next morning, when she caught sight of Hermann walking by, Lizaveta Ivanovna got up from her embroidery, went down into the hall, opened the little ventilation window and threw the letter out into the street, counting on the young officer’s readiness.

This was what he had expected and he walked back home, absorbed in his plot."
"Однако принятое ею письмо беспокоило её чрезвычайно. Впервые входила она в тайные, тесные сношения с молодым мужчиною. Его дерзость ужасала её.

Should I send him a letter?","For all that, the letter troubled her greatly. For the first time in her life she was embarking upon secret and intimate relations with a young man.

Should she return his letter to him?","Still, the letter she had received was a great worry. This was the first time she had entered into a secret and intimate relationship with a young man.

"Германн затрепетал. Удивительный анекдот снова представился его воображению. Он стал ходить около дома, думая об его хозяйке и о чудной её способности. Поздно воротился он в смиренный свой уголок; долго не мог заснуть, и, когда сон им овладел, ему пригрезились карты, зелёный стол, кипы ассигнаций и груды червонцев. Он ставил карту за картой, гнул углы решительно, выигрывал беспрестанно, и загребал к себе золото, и клал ассигнации в карман. Проснувшись уже поздно, он вздохнул о потере своего фантастического богатства, пошёл опять бродить по городу и опять очутился переддомом графини ***. Неведомая сила, казалось, привлекала его к нему. Он остановился и стал смотреть на окна. В одном увидел он черноволосую головку, наклоненную, вероятно, над книгой или над работой. Головка проподнялась. Германн увидел личико и чёрные глаза. Эта минута решила его участь.","Hermann trembled. The amazing anecdote again presented itself to his imagination. He began to walk around the house, thinking about his mistress and about her wonderful ability. Late he returned to his humble corner; For a long time he could not fall asleep, and when sleep took possession of him, he dreamed of cards, a green table, piles of banknotes and piles of chervonets. He put card after card, bent corners resolutely, won incessantly, and raked in gold, and put banknotes in his pocket. Waking up late, he sighed about the loss of his fantastic wealth, went again to wander around the city and again found himself in front of the house of the countess ***. An unknown force seemed to be drawing him to him. He stopped and looked at the windows. In one he saw a black-haired head, probably bent over a book or work. The head went up. Hermann saw a face and black eyes. This moment sealed his fate.","Hermann started. The strange story of the three cards came into his mind again. He began walking up and down past the house, thinking of its owner and her wonderful secret. It was late when he returned to his humble lodgings; he could not get to sleep for a long time, and when sleep did come he dreamed of cards, a green baize table, stacks of bank-notes and piles of gold. He played card after card, resolutely turning down the corners, winning all the time. He raked in the gold and stuffed his pockets with bank-notes. Waking late in the morning, he sighed over the loss of his fantastic wealth, and then, sallying forth to wander about the town again, once more found himself outside the countess’s house. It was as though some supernatural force drew him there. He stopped and looked up at the windows. In one of them he saw a dark head bent over a book or some needlework. The head was raised. Hermann caught sight of a rosy face and a pair of black eyes. That moment decided his fate.","Hermann shivered. The amazing story came back to his imagination. He began walking up and down outside the house, thinking about its owner and her miraculous ability. When he got back to his modest little room he could not get to sleep for a long time, and when he did drop off he kept dreaming about cards, a green table, piles of notes and heaps of gold coins. He bet on card after card, bent the corners with a firm hand, doubling his stake, and he went on winning and winning, raking in the gold and stuffing notes into his pockets. It was late when he woke up, sighing for the loss of that fantastic wealth, and when he went out again to roam the city he soon found himself outside the Countess ’s house once again. An unknown power seemed to be drawing him back there all the time. He stopped and began to look up at the windows. At one of them he could see the dark hair of a small head bending down, probably over a book or some kind of work. The small head looked up. Hermann saw a fresh-looking face with black eyes. That moment sealed his fate."
"Рассуждая таким образом, очутился он в одной из главных улиц Петербурга, переддомом старинной архитектуры. Улица была заставлена экипажами, кареты одна за другою катились к освещенному подъезду. Из карет поминутно вытягивались то стройная нога молодой красавицы, то гремучая ботфорта, то полосатый чулок и дипломатический башмак. Шубы и плащи мелькали мимо величественного швейцара. Германн остановился.","Reasoning in this way, he found himself in one of the main streets of Petersburg, in front of a house of ancient architecture.

Fur coats and cloaks passed in rapid procession before the majestic-looking concierge. Hermann stopped.","While he was thinking along these lines he suddenly found himself on one of the main streets of Petersburg, right in front of a house of ancient architecture.

"Он спустился вниз по витой лестнице и вошёл опять в спальню графини. Мёртвая старуха сидела окаменев; лицо её выражало глубокое спокойствие. Германн остановился перед нею, долго смотрел не неё, как бы желая удостовериться в ужасной истине; наконец вошёл в кабинет, ощупал за обоями дверь и стал сходить по тёмной лестнице, волнуемый странными чувствованиями. По этой самой лестнице, думал он, может быть, лет шестьдесят назад, в эту самую спальню, в такой же час, в шитом кафтане, причёсанный a l'oiseau royal, прижимая к сердцу треугольную шляпу, прокрадывался молодой счастливец, давно уже истлевший в могиле, а сердце престарелой его любовницы сегодня перестало биться...","He descended the winding stairs and entered the Countess's bedroom again.

Hermann stood in front of her and gazed long and earnestly at her, as though trying to convince himself of the terrible truth. Then he went into the study, felt behind the tapestry for the door and began to descend the dark stairway, excited by strange emotions. ‘Maybe some sixty years ago, at this very hour,’ he thought, ‘some happy youth – long since turned to dust – was stealing up this staircase into that very bedroom, in an embroidered tunic, his hair dressed à l’oiseau royal, pressing his three-cornered hat to his breast; and today the heart of his aged mistress has ceased to beat….’","He went down the spiral staircase, and back into the Countess’s bedroom.

"С нею был коротко знаком человек очень замечательный. Вы слышали о графе Сен-Жермене, о котором рассказывают так много чудесного.

She decided to appeal to him, and wrote a note asking him to come and see her immediately.","“She numbered among her acquaintances one quite remarkable man. You will have heard the name of Count Saint-Germain, about whom such wonderful stories are told. You will know that he had claimed to be the Wandering Jew, the discoverer of the elixir of life, and the philosopher’s stone, and so on. He was ridiculed as a charlatan, but Casanova in his memoirs refers to him as a spy. Putting that aside, Saint-Germain, for all his air of mystery, had a handsome look about him and a charismatic personality. To this day Grandmother loves him to distraction, and she gets angry when disrespectful things are said about him. Grandmother knew that he had access to big money. Deciding to throw herself on his mercy, she wrote him a note asking him to come round and see her without delay."
"– Что ж? – возразил Германн, – бьёте вы мою карту или нет? Чекалинский поклонился с видом того же смиренного согласия.","- Well? - objected Hermann, - are you beating my card or not? Chekalinsky bowed with the same air of humble consent.",‘Well?’ returned Hermann. ‘Do you accept my card or not?’ Tchekalinsky bowed with the same air of humble acquiescence.,"Hermann protested. “Do you accept my bet, or not?” Chekalinsky gave another bow by way of polite assent."

"Три дня после роковой ночи, в девять часов утра, Германн отправился в *** монастырь, где должны были отпевать тело усопшей графини. Не чувствуя раскаяния, он не мог однако совершенно заглушить голос совести, твердивший ему: ты убийца старухи! Имея мало истинной веры, он имел множество предрассудков. Он верил, что мёртвая графиня могла иметь вредное влияние на его жизнь, – и решился явиться на её похороны, чтобы испросить у ней прощения.","Three days after the fateful night, at nine o'clock in the morning, Hermann went to the *** monastery, where the body of the deceased countess was to be buried. Feeling no remorse, however, he could not completely drown out the voice of conscience, which kept telling him: you are the murderer of the old woman! Having little true faith, he had many prejudices. He believed that the dead countess could have a harmful effect on his life - and decided to come to her funeral to ask her forgiveness.","THREE days after that fateful night, at nine o’clock in the morning, Hermann repaired to the Convent of * * * *, where the last respects were to be paid to the mortal remains of the dead countess. Though he felt no remorse he could not altogether stifle the voice of conscience which kept repeating to him: ‘You are the old woman’s murderer!’ Having very little religious faith, he was exceedingly superstitious. Believing that the dead countess might exercise a malignant influence on his life, he decided to go to her funeral to beg and obtain her forgiveness.","Three days after the fateful night, at ten in the evening, Hermann set off for the Convent of M——, where last respects would be paid to the deceased Countess. While feeling no remorse, he couldn’t entirely silence the voice of conscience, which kept saying to him, “You murdered the old woman.” A man of little true faith, he was full of superstition. He believed that the dead Countess might still have a baleful influence on his life, and he had decided to turn up at her funeral to ask and obtain her forgiveness."
"– Выиграла! – сказал Германн, показывая свою карту.","- Won! Hermann said, showing his map.","‘I win!’ said Hermann, pointing to his card.","“I win!” said Hermann, turning up his card."
"– отвечать ли холодно и решительно? Ей не с кем было посоветоваться, у ней не было ни подруги, ни наставницы. Лизавета Ивановна решилась отвечать.","– whether to answer coldly and decisively?

"Талья длилась долго. На столе стояло более тридцати карт. Чекалинский останавливался после каждой прокладки, чтобы дать играющим время распорядиться, записывал проигрыш, учтиво вслушивался в их требования, ещё учтивее отгибал лишний угол, загибаемый рассеянною рукою. Наконец талья кончилась. Чекалинский стасовал карты и приготовился метать другую.","Talya lasted a long time. There were more than thirty cards on the table. Chekalinsky stopped after each laying in order to give the players time to dispose, wrote down the loss, listened politely to their demands, even more courteously turned back an extra corner, bent by an absent-minded hand. Finally, the tail is over. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards and prepared to throw another.","The game continued for some while. On the table lay more than thirty cards. Tchekalinsky paused after each round to give the players time to arrange their cards and note their losses, listened courteously to their observations and more courteously still straightened the corner of a card that some careless hand had turned down. At last the game finished. Tchekalinsky shuffled the cards and prepared to deal again.","The game was a long one. There were more than thirty cards out on the table. Chekalinsky paused after each deal, giving time for the players to sort themselves out, and he would make a note of any losses, generously listening to their requests, and even more generously straightening the odd corner of a card that may have been bent over inadvertently. Eventually the game came to an end. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards and prepared to start again."
Он остановился и с трепетом ожидал её ответа. Графиня молчала; Германн стал на колени.,He stopped and waited in trepidation for her answer. The Countess was silent; Hermann knelt down.,"He paused, feverishly waiting for her reply. She was silent. Hermann fell on his knees.","He stopped, and waited, quivering, for her to respond. The Countess said nothing. Hermann went down on his knees."
"Старый чудак явился тотчас и застал в ужасном горе. Она описала ему самыми черными красками варварство мужа и сказала наконец, что всю свою надежду полагает на его дружбу и любезность.","The old eccentric appeared at once and found him in terrible grief.

"Германн вынул из карман банковый билет и подал его Чекалинскому, который, бегло посмотрев его, положил на Германнову карту.","Hermann took a bank note out of his pocket and handed it to Chekalinsky, who, having glanced at it briefly, placed it on Hermann's card.","Hermann took a bank-note from his pocket and handed it to Tchekalinsky, who after a cursory glance placed it on Hermann’s card.","Hermann took a banknote from his pocket and handed it to Chekalinsky, who glanced at it and then placed it on Hermann’s card."
"Но Германн не унялся. Лизавета Ивановна каждый день получала от него письма, то тем, то другим образом. Они уже не были переведены с немецкого. Германн писал их, вдохновенный страстию, и говорил языком, ему свойственным: в нём выражались и непреклонность его желаний и беспорядок необузданного воображения. Лизавета Ивановна уже не думала их отсылать: она упивалась ими; стала на них отвечать, – и её записки час от часу становились длиннее и нежнее. Наконец, она бросила ему в окошко следующее письмо:","But Hermann did not give up. Lizaveta Ivanovna received letters from him every day, now in one way or another. They were no longer translated from German. Hermann wrote them, inspired by passion, and spoke in a language characteristic of him: it expressed both the inflexibility of his desires and the disorder of his unbridled imagination.

At last she threw out of the window to him the following letter:,"But Hermann was not put off. Every day Lizaveta Ivanovna received a letter from him by one means or another. They were not now translated from German. Hermann wrote them himself, passionately inspired, and he wrote in his own way; they were an expression of his determination, his desire and the confusion of his unbridled imagination. It no longer occurred to Lizaveta Ivanovna to return them; she thoroughly enjoyed them and began to reply. Her notes to him became longer and sweeter by the hour. At last she dropped the following letter to him out through the window:"
"Подошедшие к ним три дамы с вопросами – oubli ou regret? – прервали разговор, который становился мучительно любопытен для Лизаветы Ивановны.","Three ladies approached them with questions - oubli ou regret? - interrupted the conversation, which was becoming painfully curious for Lizaveta Ivanovna.",Three ladies coming up to invite Tomsky to choose between ‘oubli ou regret?’ interrupted the conversation which had become so painfully interesting to Lizaveta Ivanovna.,"The conversation, which had become painfully intriguing for Lizaveta Ivanovna, was interrupted by three ladies who came up to them to ask “oubli ou regret?”."
"Утро наступало. Лизавета Ивановна погасила догорающую свечу: бледный свет озарил её комнату. Она отёрла заплаканные глаза и подняла их на Германна: он сидел на окошке, сложа руки и грозно нахмурясь. В этом положении удивительно напоминал он портрет Наполеона. Это сходство поразило даже Лизавету Ивановну.","Morning came. Lizaveta Ivanovna put out the dying candle: a pale light illuminated her room. She wiped her tear-stained eyes and raised them to Hermann: he was sitting at the window with folded arms and a menacing frown. In this position, he surprisingly resembled a portrait of Napoleon. This similarity struck even Lizaveta Ivanovna.","Morning came. Lizaveta Ivanovna blew out the candle which had burned down. A pale light illumined the room.

Thin daylight brightened her room. She wiped her tear-stained eyes and looked up at Hermann. He was sitting on the window sill with his arms folded and a grim scowl on his face.

"– Коли письмо не к вам, зачем же вы его разорвали? – сказала мамзель, – я бы возвратила его тому, кто его послал.","- If the letter is not for you, why did you tear it up? - said Mamzel, - I would return it to the one who sent it.","‘If the letter was not for you, why did you tear it up?’ said the girl. ‘I would have returned it to the sender.’","“If it’s not for you, why have you torn it up?” asked the young miss. “I could have taken it back to the sender.”"

Grandmamma gave him a box on the ear and retired to bed without him as a sign of her displeasure.","My late grandfather, I seem to recall, was like a butler to my grandmother.

"– Для кого вам беречь вашу тайну? Для внуков? Они богаты и без того: они же не знают и цены деньгам. Моту не помогут ваши три карты. Кто не умеет беречь отцовское наследство, тот всё-таки умрёт в нищете, несмотря ни на какие демонские усилия. Я не мот; я знаю цену деньгам. Ваши три карты для меня не пропадут. Ну!..","Who are you keeping your secret for? For grandchildren? They are rich without that: they do not know the value of money. Your three cards won't help Motu.

Your three cards will not be wasted for me. Well!..",‘For whom would you keep your secret? For your grandsons? They are rich enough already: they don’t appreciate the value of money. Your three cards would not help a spendthrift. A man who does not take care of his inheritance will die a beggar though all the demons of the world were at his command. I am not a spendthrift: I know the value of money. Your three cards would not be wasted on me. Well?…’,"“For whom are you keeping this secret? Your grandchildren? They’re already rich.
