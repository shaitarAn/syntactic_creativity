"Mais si puissantes que fussent sur l'esprit du jeune homme toutes ces réflexions, elles s'évanouirent à l'instant où il vit s'élever devant lui le spectre sombre et gigantesque du Colisée, à travers les ouvertures duquel la lune projetait ces longs et pâles rayons qui tombent des yeux des fantômes.

"La rage succéda à l'ascétisme. Edmond lançait des blasphèmes qui faisaient reculer d'horreur le geôlier; il brisait son corps contre les murs de sa prison; il s'en prenait avec fureur à tout ce qui l'entourait, et surtout à lui-même, de la moindre contrariété que lui faisait éprouver un grain de sable, un fétu de paille, un souffle d'air. Alors cette lettre dénonciatrice qu'il avait vue, que lui avait montrée Villefort, qu'il avait touchée, lui revenait à l'esprit, chaque ligne flamboyait sur la muraille comme le Mane, Thecel, Pharès de Balthazar. Il se disait que c'était la haine des hommes et non la vengeance de Dieu qui l'avait plongé dans l'abîme où il était; il vouait ces hommes inconnus à tous les supplices dont son ardente imagination lui fournissait l'idée, et il trouvait encore que les plus terribles étaient trop doux et surtout trop courts pour eux; car après le supplice venait la mort; et dans la mort était, sinon le repos, du moins l'insensibilité qui lui ressemble.","Rage succeeded to asceticism. Edmond hurled blasphemies which made the jailer recoil in horror; he smashed his body against the walls of his prison; he lashed out furiously at everything around him, and above all at himself, for the slightest annoyance caused him by a grain of sand, a wisp of straw, a breath of air. Then that denunciatory letter which he had seen, which Villefort had shown him, which he had touched, came back to his mind, each line blazing on the wall like Balthazar's Mane, Thecel, Phares. He said to himself that it was the hatred of men and not the vengeance of God which had plunged him into the abyss where he was; he condemned these unknown men to all the tortures of which his ardent imagination provided him with the idea, and he still found that the most terrible were too mild and above all too short for them; for after the punishment came death; and in death was, if not rest, at least the insensitivity which resembles it.","Fury followed asceticism. Edmond’s curses made his jailer start back in horror. He dashed himself against the walls of his prison and raged against everything around him, himself first of all, at the slightest discomfort caused by a grain of sand, a straw or a draught. Then it was that he recalled the denunciatory letter that he had seen, that Villefort had shown him, that his hands had touched. Every line blazed on the cell wall like the Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin at Belshazzar’s feast.3 He decided that it was human hatred and not divine vengeance that had plunged him into this abyss. He doomed these unknown men to every torment that his inflamed imagination could devise, while still considering that the most frightful were too mild and, above all, too brief for them: torture was followed by death, and death brought, if not repose, at least an insensibility that resembled it.","Rage supplanted religious fervor. Dantes uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself, so that the least thing, — a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene tekel upharsin of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the vengeance of heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of unconsciousness."

"Août s'écoula dans des tentatives sans cesse renouvelées par Morrel de relever son ancien crédit ou de s'en ouvrir un nouveau. Le 20 août, on sut à Marseille qu'il avait pris une place à la malle-poste, et l'on se dit alors que c'était pour la fin du mois courant que le bilan devait être déposé, et que Morrel était parti d'avance pour ne pas assister à cet acte cruel, délégué sans doute à son premier commis Emmanuel et à son caissier Coclès. Mais, contre toutes les prévisions lorsque le 31 août arriva, la caisse s'ouvrit comme d'habitude. Coclès apparut derrière le grillage, calme comme le juste d'Horace, examina avec la même attention le papier qu'on lui présentait, et, depuis la première jusqu'à la dernière, paya les traites avec la même exactitude. Il vint même deux remboursements qu'avait prévus M. Morrel, et que Coclès paya avec la même ponctualité que les traites qui étaient personnelles à l'armateur. On n'y comprenait plus rien, et l'on remettait, avec la ténacité particulière aux prophètes de mauvaises nouvelles, la faillite à la fin de septembre.","August elapsed in constantly renewed attempts by Morrel to raise his old credit or to open up a new one. On August 20, we learned in Marseilles that he had taken a place at the mail coach, and we said to ourselves that it was for the end of the current month that the balance sheet was to be filed, and that Morrel had left. in advance so as not to witness this cruel act, delegated no doubt to his first clerk Emmanuel and his cashier Coclès. But, contrary to all predictions, when August 31st arrived, the till opened as usual. Cocles appeared behind the grating, calm as Horace's justice, examined with the same attention the paper presented to him, and, from the first to the last, paid the bills with the same exactness. There were even two repayments which M. Morrel had foreseen, and which Cocles paid with the same punctuality as the drafts which were personal to the ship-owner. They no longer understood anything, and they put off, with the tenacity peculiar to the prophets of bad news, the bankruptcy at the end of September.","August passed with continued and repeated attempts by Morrel to increase his old credit or open a new account. On 20 August it was learned in Marseille that he had reserved a place on the stage-coach, and as a result they said that it must be at the end of that current month that he would declare his bankruptcy: he had already left, so that he would not have to be present in these awful circumstances, leaving his head clerk, Emmanuel, and his cashier, Coclès, to take care of it on his behalf. But, against all expectations, when 31 August came, the office opened for payment as usual. Coclès appeared behind the grille, as calm as Horace’s just man, examined the paper that was presented to him with the same attention as ever and, from first to last, settled the bills with his usual precision. There were even two reimbursements which had been foreseen by M. Morrel, which Coclès paid as scrupulously as the bills which were personally drawn on the shipowner. No one could understand what was happening but, with the usual tenacity of prophets of doom, they postponed the bankruptcy until the end of September.","August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier Cocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted.

"Alors ce fut une volupté sans trêve, un amour sans repos, comme celui que promettait le Prophète à ses élus. Alors toutes ces bouches de pierre se firent vivantes, toutes ces poitrines se firent chaudes, au point que pour Franz, subissant pour la première fois l'empire du hachisch, cet amour était presque une douleur, cette volupté presque une torture, lorsqu'il sentait passer sur sa bouche altérée les lèvres de ces statues, souples et froides comme les anneaux d'une couleuvre; mais plus ses bras tentaient de repousser cet amour inconnu, plus ses sens subissaient le charme de ce songe mystérieux, si bien qu'après une lutte pour laquelle on eût donné son âme, il s'abandonna sans réserve et finit par retomber haletant, brûlé de fatigue, épuisé de volupté, sous les baisers de ces maîtresses de marbre et sous les enchantements de ce rêve inouï.","Then it was a pleasure without truce, a love without rest, like that which the Prophet promised to his chosen ones. Then all those stone mouths became alive, all those breasts became warm, to the point that for Franz, undergoing for the first time the empire of hashish, this love was almost a pain, this voluptuousness almost a torture, when he felt the lips of these statues pass over his altered mouth, supple and cold like the rings of a snake; but the more his arms tried to repel this unknown love, the more his senses suffered the charm of this mysterious dream, so much so that after a struggle for which one would have given his soul, he abandoned himself without reserve and ended by falling back, panting, burned. of fatigue, exhausted with pleasure, under the kisses of these marble mistresses and under the enchantments of this unheard-of dream.","After that, he felt unremitting sensuality and continual love-making, such as the Prophet promised to the elect. Now all those stone mouths became living ones and those breasts became warm, to such an extent that for Franz, falling for the first time under the domain of hashish, this lust was almost pain and this voluptuousness almost torture, as he felt the lips of these statues, supple and cold as the coils of a viper, touching his parched mouth. But the more his arms tried to ward off this unknown embrace, the more his senses fell beneath the spell of this mysterious dream, so that, after a struggle in which he would have given his soul, he abandoned himself unreservedly and eventually fell back, panting, seared with exhaustion, worn out with lust, beneath the kisses of these marble mistresses and the enchantment of this unimaginable dream.","It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the enchantment of his marvellous dream."

"—Le roi! Je le croyais assez philosophe pour comprendre qu'il n'y a pas de meurtre en politique. En politique, mon cher, vous le savez comme moi, il n'y a pas d'hommes, mais des idées; pas de sentiments, mais des intérêts; en politique, on ne tue pas un homme: on supprime un obstacle, voilà tout. Voulez-vous savoir comment les choses se sont passées? eh bien, moi, je vais vous le dire. On croyait pouvoir compter sur le général Quesnel: on nous l'avait recommandé de l'île d'Elbe, l'un de nous va chez lui, l'invite à se rendre rue Saint-Jacques à une assemblée où il trouvera des amis; il y vient, et là on lui déroule tout le plan, le départ de l'île d'Elbe, le débarquement projeté; puis, quand il a tout écouté tout entendu, qu'il ne reste plus rien à lui apprendre, il répond qu'il est royaliste: alors chacun se regarde; on lui fait faire serment, il le fait, mais de si mauvaise grâce vraiment, que c'était tenter Dieu que de jurer ainsi; eh bien, malgré tout cela, on a laissé le général sortir libre, parfaitement libre. Il n'est pas rentré chez lui, que voulez-vous, mon cher? Il est sorti de chez nous: il se sera trompé de chemin, voilà tout. Un meurtre! en vérité vous me surprenez, Villefort, vous, substitut du procureur du roi, de bâtir une accusation sur de si mauvaises preuves. Est-ce que jamais je me suis avisé de vous dire à vous, quand vous exercez votre métier de royaliste, et que vous faites couper la tête à l'un des miens: «Mon fils, vous avez commis un meurtre!» Non, j'ai dit: «Très bien, monsieur, vous avez combattu victorieusement; à demain la revanche.»","-The king! I thought he was philosophical enough to understand that there is no murder in politics. In politics, my dear, you know it like me, there are no men, only ideas; not feelings, but interests; in politics, you don't kill a man: you remove an obstacle, that's all. Want to know how things went? well, I'll tell you. We thought we could count on General Quesnel: he had been recommended to us from the island of Elba, one of us went to his house, invited him to go to rue Saint-Jacques to a meeting where he would find friends. ; he comes there, and there the whole plan is unfolded to him, the departure from the island of Elba, the projected landing; then, when he has listened to everything and heard everything, when there is nothing left to teach him, he replies that he is a royalist: then everyone looks at each other; he is made to take an oath, he does it, but really with such bad grace that it was tempting God to swear thus; well, despite all that, the general was allowed to go out free, perfectly free. He has not returned home, what do you want, my dear? He left our house: he will have taken the wrong way, that's all. A murder! in truth you surprise me, Villefort, you, deputy of the king's attorney, to build an accusation on such bad proofs. Did I ever take it into your head to say to you, when you exercise your profession of royalist, and you have one of my people's head beheaded: ""My son, you have committed murder!"" No, I said, “All right, sir, you fought victorious; see you tomorrow, revenge.”","‘The king! I thought him enough of a philosopher to realize that there is no such thing as murder in politics.

One of us went round to his house and invited him to attend a meeting in the Rue Saint-Jacques where he would be among friends. He came and was told the whole plan: departure from the island of Elba, the intended landing place. Then, when he had listened to everything and heard everything, and there was no more for him to learn, he announced that he was a Royalist. At this, we all looked at one another. We obliged him to take an oath and he did so, but truly with such little good grace that it was tempting God to swear in that way. In spite of all, however, we let him go freely, quite freely. He did not return home: what do you expect, my dear? He left us and must have taken the wrong road, that’s all. A murder! Really, Villefort, you surprise me – you, a deputy crown prosecutor, making an accusation founded on such poor evidence. Have I ever told you, when you have done your job as a Royalist and had the head cut off one of our people: “My son, you have committed murder”? No, I have said: “Very well, Monsieur, you have fought and won, but tomorrow we shall have our revenge.” ’","""The king!

Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that's all. A murder? really, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found an accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of my party, `My son, you have committed a murder?' No, I said, `Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; to-morrow, perchance, it will be our turn.'"""

"Mais maintenant que le jeune homme avait vu un vieillard se cramponner à la vie avec tant d'énergie et lui donner l'exemple des résolutions désespérées, il se mit à réfléchir et à mesurer son courage. Un autre avait tenté ce qu'il n'avait pas même eu l'idée de faire; un autre, moins jeune, moins fort, moins adroit que lui, s'était procuré, à force d'adresse et de patience, tous les instruments dont il avait besoin pour cette incroyable opération, qu'une mesure mal prise avait pu seule faire échouer: un autre avait fait tout cela, rien n'était donc impossible à Dantès: Faria avait percé cinquante pieds, il en percerait cent, Faria, à cinquante ans, avait mis trois ans à son œuvre; il n'avait que la moitié de l'âge de Faria, lui, il en mettrait six; Faria, abbé, savant, homme d'Église, n'avait pas craint de risquer la traversée du château d'If à l'île de Daume, de Ratonneau ou de Lemaire; lui, Edmond le marin, lui, Dantès le hardi plongeur, qui avait été si souvent chercher une branche de corail au fond de la mer, hésiterait-il donc à faire une lieue en nageant? que fallait-il pour faire une lieue en nageant? une heure? Eh bien, n'était-il donc pas resté des heures entières à la mer sans reprendre pied sur le rivage! Non, non, Dantès n'avait besoin que d'être encouragé par un exemple. Tout ce qu'un autre a fait ou aurait pu faire, Dantès le fera.","But now that the young man had seen an old man clinging to life with so much energy and giving him the example of desperate resolutions, he began to reflect and measure his courage. Another had tried what he hadn't even thought of doing; another, less young, less strong, less skilful than he, had procured, by dint of skill and patience, all the instruments he needed for this incredible operation, which only a badly taken measure could have done. to fail: another had done all that, nothing was therefore impossible for Dantès: Faria had pierced fifty feet, he would pierce a hundred, Faria, at fifty, had taken three years to complete his work; he was only half Faria's age, he would be six; Faria, abbot, scholar, man of the Church, had not been afraid to risk crossing from the Chateau d'If to the isle of Daume, Ratonneau or Lemaire; he, Edmond the sailor, he, Dantès the bold diver, who had so often been to look for a branch of coral at the bottom of the sea, would he hesitate to swim a league? what was needed to swim a league? one o'clock? Well, hadn't he remained whole hours at sea without regaining his footing on the shore! No, no, Dantès only needed to be encouraged by an example. Everything another has done or could have done, Dantès will do.","But now that he had seen an old man clasping on to life with such energy and giving him the example of such desperate resolve, he started to reflect and to measure his courage. Another man had attempted to do something that he had not even thought of doing; another, less young, less strong and less agile than himself, had succeeded, by sheer skill and patience, in acquiring all the implements he needed for this incredible task, which had failed only because of a failure of measurement; someone else had done all this, so nothing was impossible for Dantès. Faria had dug fifty feet, he would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had spent three years on the work; he was only half Faria’s age, he could afford six; Faria, the priest, the learned churchman, had not shrunk from the prospect of swimming from the Château d’If to the islands of Daume, Ratonneau or Lemaire; so would he, Edmond the sailor, Dantès the bold swimmer, who had so often plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch a branch of coral – would he shrink from swimming a league? How long did it take to swim a league: one hour? And had he not spent whole hours on end in the sea without setting foot on shore? No, Dantès needed only to be encouraged by example. Anything that another man had done or could have done, Dantès would do.","But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only because of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantes? Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantes would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands — Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailer, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement's sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than twice as long! At once Dantes resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again."

Soon, at the change of atmosphere, he understood that he was entering an underground passage; after walking for a few seconds, he heard a creaking, and it seemed to him that the atmosphere was again changing in nature and becoming warm and fragrant; finally, he felt that his feet rested on a thick, soft carpet; his guides abandoned him.

"«Je levai la tête, j'étais dans l'obscurité la plus profonde. Je sonnai pour qu'on m'apportât de la lumière, personne ne vint; je résolus alors de me servir moi-même. C'était d'ailleurs une habitude de philosophe qu'il allait me falloir prendre. Je pris d'une main une bougie toute préparée, et de l'autre je cherchai, à défaut des allumettes absentes de leur boîte, un papier que je comptais allumer à un dernier reste de flamme au-dessus du foyer; mais, craignant dans l'obscurité de prendre un papier précieux à la place d'un papier inutile, j'hésitais, lorsque je me rappelai avoir vu, dans le fameux bréviaire qui était posé sur la table à côté de moi, un vieux papier tout jaune par le haut, qui avait l'air de servir de signet, et qui avait traversé les siècles maintenu à sa place par la vénération des héritiers. Je cherchai, en tâtonnant, cette feuille inutile, je la trouvai, je la tordis, et, la présentant à la flamme mourante, je l'allumai.","“I looked up, I was in the deepest darkness. I rang for light, no one came; I then resolved to serve myself. It was, moreover, a philosopher's habit that I was going to have to adopt.

I groped for this useless sheet, I found it, I twisted it, and, presenting it to the dying flame, I lit it.","‘I looked up. I was in utter darkness.

But I was afraid that, in the darkness, I would take some precious leaf of paper instead of a useless one, so I hesitated. Then I remembered that, in the famous breviary, which was sitting on the table beside me, I had seen an old piece of paper, partly yellowed with age, which appeared to serve as a bookmark and which had been handed down as such through the ages, preserved by the veneration of Cardinal Spada’s heirs. I groped around for this useless scrap, found it, folded it and thrust it into the dying fire to light it.","I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs.

"«De son côté Luigi sentait naître en lui un sentiment inconnu: c'était comme une douleur sourde qui le mordait au cœur d'abord, et de là, toute frémissante, courait par ses veines et s'emparait de tout son corps; il suivit des yeux les moindres mouvements de Teresa et de son cavalier; lorsque leurs mains se touchaient il ressentait comme des éblouissements, ses artères battaient avec violence, et l'on eût dit que le son d'une cloche vibrait à ses oreilles. Lorsqu'ils se parlaient, quoique Teresa écoutât, timide et les yeux baissés, les discours de son cavalier, comme Luigi lisait dans les yeux ardents du beau jeune homme que ces discours étaient des louanges, il lui semblait que la terre tournait sous lui et que toutes les voix de l'enfer lui soufflaient des idées de meurtre et d'assassinat. Alors, craignant de se laisser emporter à sa folie, il se cramponnait d'une main à la charmille contre laquelle il était debout, et de l'autre il serrait d'un mouvement convulsif le poignard au manche sculpté qui était passé dans sa ceinture et que, sans s'en apercevoir, il tirait quelquefois presque entier du fourreau.","“For his part, Luigi felt an unknown feeling rising within him: it was like a dull pain which first bit his heart, and from there, quivering, ran through his veins and seized his whole body; he followed with his eyes the slightest movements of Teresa and her partner; when their hands touched he felt something like dazzling, his arteries throbbing violently, and it was as if the sound of a bell vibrated in his ears. When they spoke to each other, although Teresa listened, shy and with lowered eyes, to the speeches of her partner, as Luigi read in the ardent eyes of the handsome young man that these speeches were praises, it seemed to him that the earth turned under him and that all the voices of hell whispered to him ideas of murder and assassination. Then, fearing to let himself be carried away by his madness, he clung with one hand to the bower against which he was standing, and with the other he clutched with a convulsive movement the dagger with the sculpted handle which had passed through his belt. and that, without realizing it, he sometimes drew almost entirely from the scabbard.","‘Luigi, on the other hand, was gripped by a previously unknown emotion: it was like a dull pain, gnawing first at his heart, then quivering as it spread through his veins and took possession of his whole body. His eyes followed every movement made by Teresa and her squire. When their hands touched, he felt a sort of dizziness, his heart thumped and it was as though a bell were chiming in his ears. When they spoke, though Teresa was listening shyly and with lowered gaze to the young nobleman’s words, Luigi could read in the man’s eyes that they were compliments, and it seemed to him that the earth was spinning beneath his feet, while all the voices of hell whispered ideas of murder and violence. Then, fearing that he might be carried away by his folly, with one hand he clasped the arbour beneath which he was standing, and with the other he grasped convulsively the dagger with the sculpted hilt which he kept in his belt and which, unconsciously, he was drawing from time to time almost entirely out of its sheath.","""Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through his whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon; every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination. Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which, unwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to time."

C'était, comme tous les Méridionaux, un homme sobre et sans de grands besoins, mais vaniteux pour les choses extérieures; aussi, au temps de sa prospérité, il ne laissait passer ni une ferrade, ni une procession de la tarasque sans s'y montrer avec la Carconte, l'un dans ce costume pittoresque des hommes du Midi et qui tient à la fois du catalan et de l'andalou; l'autre avec ce charmant habit des femmes d'Arles qui semble emprunté à la Grèce et à l'Arabie; mais peu à peu, chaînes de montres, colliers, ceinturés aux mille couleurs, corsages brodés, vestes de velours, bas à coins élégants, guêtres bariolées, souliers à boucles d'argent avaient disparu, et Gaspard Caderousse, ne pouvant plus se montrer à la hauteur de sa splendeur passée, avait renoncé pour lui et pour sa femme à toutes ces pompes mondaines, dont il entendait, en se rongeant sourdement le cœur, les bruits joyeux retentir jusqu'à cette pauvre auberge, qu'il continuait de garder bien plus comme un abri que comme une spéculation.","However, despite this alleged resignation to the decrees of Providence, let no one believe that our innkeeper did not deeply feel the state of misery to which this miserable Beaucaire canal had reduced him, and that he was invulnerable to the incessant complaints with which his wife pursued him. He was, like all Southerners, a sober man and without great needs, but vain in external things; also, in the days of his prosperity, he never allowed a ferrade or a procession of the Tarasque to pass without showing himself there with La Carconte, one in that picturesque costume of the men of the South and which at the same time resembles Catalan and Andalusian; the other with that charming dress of the women of Arles which seems borrowed from Greece and Arabia; but little by little watch chains, necklaces, belts of a thousand colors, embroidered bodices, velvet jackets, stockings with elegant corners, multicolored gaiters, shoes with silver buckles had disappeared, and Gaspard Caderousse, no longer able the height of his past splendour, had renounced for himself and for his wife all these worldly pomps, whose joyful noises he heard, while gnawing at his heart, resound even to this poor inn, which he continued to keep well more like shelter than speculation.","However, it should not be thought that the innkeeper, despite this pretence of resignation to the decrees of fate, was not acutely sensible of the poverty to which he had been reduced by the confounded Beaucaire canal, or that he was proof against the endless complaints that his wife heaped on him. Like all Southerners, he was moderate, needing little for himself, but vain when it came to external matters; so, in the days of his prosperity, he would not let a ferrade or a procession of the tarasque1 go past without appearing in it, La Carconte at his side: he would be dressed in the picturesque costume of a man from the Midi, somewhere between Catalan and Andalusian dress, while she would have on the delightful attire of the women of Arles, suggestive of Greece and Arabia. Little by little, however, watch-chains, necklaces, gaudy belts, embroidered blouses, velvet jackets, elegantly trimmed stockings, multicoloured gaiters and silver-buckled shoes had vanished, until Gaspard Caderousse could no longer appear in his former splendour; so, on his own behalf and that of his wife, he gave up all these worldly exhibitions, though he felt a bitter pang when the happy sounds of some celebration would reach this miserable inn, which he kept much more to have a roof over his head than as a business proposition.","Still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate inn-keeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner's murmurs and lamentations. Like other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to display. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarfs, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded."

"Et il abaissa effectivement sa carabine vers Dantès qui sentit s'appuyer le bout du canon contre sa tempe. Un instant, il eut l'idée de faire ce mouvement défendu et d'en finir ainsi violemment avec le malheur inattendu qui s'était abattu sur lui et l'avait pris tout à coup dans ses serres de vautour. Mais, justement parce que ce malheur était inattendu, Dantès songea qu'il ne pouvait être durable; puis les promesses de M. de Villefort lui revinrent à l'esprit; puis, s'il faut le dire enfin, cette mort au fond d'un bateau, venant de la main d'un gendarme, lui apparue laide et nue. Il retomba donc sur le plancher de la barque en poussant un hurlement de rage et en se rongeant les mains avec fureur. Presque au même instant, un choc violent ébranla le canot. Un des bateliers sauta sur le roc que la proue de la petite barque venait de toucher, une corde grinça en se déroulant autour d'une poulie, et Dantès comprit qu'on était arrivé et qu'on amarrait l'esquif.","And he actually lowered his rifle towards Dantès, who felt the end of the barrel lean against his temple. For a moment, he had the idea of making this forbidden movement and thus putting a violent end to the unexpected misfortune which had befallen him and had suddenly taken him in its vulture claws. But, precisely because this misfortune was unexpected, Dantès reflected that it could not be lasting; then M. de Villefort's promises came back to him; then, if it must be said finally, this death at the bottom of a boat, coming from the hand of a policeman, appeared to him ugly and bare. So he fell back on the floor of the boat, uttering a howl of rage and gnawing his hands furiously. Almost at the same time, a violent shock shook the canoe. One of the boatmen jumped on the rock which the prow of the small boat had just touched, a rope creaked as it unwound around a pulley, and Dantès understood that they had arrived and that they were mooring the skiff.","He gave every indication of his intention to carry out his threat, lowering his musket until Dantès could feel the barrel pressing against his temple. For an instant he considered making the forbidden movement and so putting a violent end to the misfortune that had swooped down and suddenly seized him in its vulture’s grip. But, precisely because the misfortune was so unexpected, Dantès felt that it could not be long-lasting. Then he remembered M. de Villefort’s promises. And finally, it must be admitted that death in the bilge of an open boat at the hands of a gendarme struck him as ugly and grim. So he fell back on to the planks of the vessel with a cry of rage, gnawing at his fists in his fury. Almost at the same moment, the boat shook violently. One of the oarsmen leapt on the rock that had just struck against its prow, a rope groaned as it unwound from a pulley, and Dantès realized that they had arrived and the skiff was being moored.","And he levelled his carbine at Dantes, who felt the muzzle against his temple. For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M. de Villefort's promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury. At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of the sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley, and Dantes guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they were mooring the boat."

Take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.

"Les contrebandiers revinrent le sixième jour. Dantès reconnut de loin le port et la marche de la Jeune-Amélie; il se traîna jusqu'au port comme Philoctète blessé, et lorsque ses compagnons abordèrent, il leur annonça, tout en se plaignant encore, un mieux sensible; puis à son tour, il écouta le récit des aventuriers. Ils avaient réussi, il est vrai; mais à peine le chargement avait-il été déposé, qu'ils avaient eu avis qu'un brick en surveillance à Toulon venait de sortir du port et se dirigeait de leur côté. Ils s'étaient alors enfuis à tire-d'aile, regrettant que Dantès, qui savait donner une vitesse si supérieure au bâtiment, ne fût point là pour le diriger. En effet, bientôt ils avaient aperçu le bâtiment chasseur; mais à l'aide de la nuit, et en doublant le cap Corse, ils lui avaient échappé.","The smugglers returned on the sixth day. Dantès recognized from afar the port and the march of the Jeune-Amelie; he dragged himself to the port like a wounded Philoctetes, and when his companions landed, he announced to them, while still complaining, a noticeable improvement; then in turn, he listened to the story of the adventurers. They had succeeded, it is true; but scarcely had the cargo been deposited than they had notice that a brig on surveillance at Toulon had just left the port and was heading towards them. They had then fled at full speed, regretting that Dantès, who knew how to give such a superior speed to the ship, was not there to direct it. Indeed, soon they had sighted the fighter ship; but by the aid of the night, and by rounding Cap Corse, they had escaped him.","The smugglers returned on the sixth day. From afar, Dantès recognized the Jeune-Amélie by its cut and its gait: it was limping into port like a wounded Philoctetes. When his companions stepped ashore, Dantès told them that he was considerably better, though he continued to complain. Then in turn he listened to the smugglers’ tales. They had certainly been successful, but hardly had the cargo been off-loaded than they learned that a brig of the excise from Toulon had just left harbour and was heading in their direction. They took flight at once, regretting that Dantès, who knew how to get so much greater speed out of the vessel, was not there to guide them. The following boat soon came into view, but they managed to escape under cover of night and by rounding the Cap Corse.","On the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dantes recognized the rig and handling of The Young Amelia, and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than when they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident. He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantes, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit."

Ce n'est pas chose rare sans doute qu'une pierre qui se détache sous le pied du temps et va rouler dans l'abîme; mais, cette fois, il lui semblait que c'était aux pieds d'un homme que la pierre avait cédé et qu'un bruit de pas arrivait jusqu'à lui, quoique celui qui l'occasionnait fît tout ce qu'il put pour l'assourdir.","Franz had been there for about a quarter of an hour, lost, as I said, in the shadow of a column, busy watching Albert, who, accompanied by his two torchbearers, had just come out of a vomitorium placed at the other end of the Colosseum, and which, like shadows following a will-o'-the-wisp, descended from step to step towards the places reserved for the vestals, when he seemed to hear rolling in the depths of the monument a stone detached from the stairway opposite the one he had just taken to get to where he was sitting. It is no doubt not a rare thing for a stone to come loose under the foot of time and roll into the abyss; but this time it seemed to him that it was at the feet of a man that the stone had given way and that the sound of footsteps reached him, although the one who caused it did all he could to mute it.","He had been there for about a quarter of an hour, seated, as I said, in the shadow of a column and lost in the contemplation of Albert who, accompanied by his two torchbearers, had just emerged from a vomitorium at the far end of the Colosseum and with them, like shadows pursuing a will-o’-the-wisp, was descending step by step towards the seats reserved for the Vestal Virgins, when Franz thought he heard a loose stone tumbling into the depths of the building from the staircase opposite the one that he had just taken to reach the place where he was sitting. No doubt there is nothing exceptional here in a stone coming away beneath the foot of time and rolling into the depths; but it seemed to him that on this occasion a man’s foot was the cause and that steps were approaching him, even though the person responsible for them was doing his very best to muffle them.","Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a vomitarium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes-fatui. All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended. There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that some one, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat."

"Caligula ou Néron, ces grands chercheurs de trésors, ces désireurs de l'impossible, eussent prêté l'oreille aux paroles de ce pauvre homme et lui eussent accordé l'air qu'il désirait, l'espace qu'il estimait à un si haut prix, et la liberté qu'il offrait de payer si cher. Mais les rois de nos jours, maintenus dans la limite du probable, n'ont plus l'audace de la volonté; ils craignent l'oreille qui écoute les ordres qu'ils donnent, l'œil qui scrute leurs actions; ils ne sentent plus la supériorité de leur essence divine; ils sont des hommes couronnés, voilà tout. Jadis, ils se croyaient, ou du moins se disaient fils de Jupiter, et retenaient quelque chose des façons du dieu leur père: on ne contrôle pas facilement ce qui se passe au-delà des nuages; aujourd'hui, les rois se laissent aisément rejoindre. Or, comme il a toujours répugné au gouvernement despotique de montrer au grand jour les effets de la prison et de la torture; comme il y a peu d'exemples qu'une victime des inquisitions ait pu reparaître avec ses os broyés et ses plaies saignantes, de même la folie, cet ulcère né dans la fange des cachots à la suite des tortures morales, se cache presque toujours avec soin dans le lieu où elle est née, ou, si elle en sort, elle va s'ensevelir dans quelque hôpital sombre, où les médecins ne reconnaissent ni l'homme ni la pensée dans le débris informe que leur transmet le geôlier fatigué.","Caligula or Nero, those great treasure seekers, those desirous of the impossible, would have listened to the words of this poor man and granted him the air he desired, the space he estimated at so high price, and the freedom it offered to pay so dearly. But the kings of our day, kept within the limit of the probable, no longer have the audacity of will; they fear the ear that listens to the orders they give, the eye that scrutinizes their actions; they no longer feel the superiority of their divine essence; they are crowned men, that is all. Formerly, they believed themselves, or at least called themselves sons of Jupiter, and retained something of the ways of the god their father: one does not easily control what happens beyond the clouds; today, kings can easily be reached. Now, as it has always been repugnant to despotic government to show in broad daylight the effects of imprisonment and torture; as there are few examples that a victim of the inquisitions has been able to reappear with his bones crushed and his wounds bleeding, so madness, this ulcer born in the mire of the dungeons as a result of moral tortures, is almost always hidden with care in the place where she was born, or, if she leaves it, she will bury herself in some gloomy hospital, where the doctors recognize neither the man nor the thought in the formless debris which the weary jailer transmits to them.","Those great treasure-hunters, Caligula and Nero, searchers after the unattainable, would have listened to the poor man’s words and given him the opportunity that he wanted, the space that he valued so highly and the freedom for which he was ready to pay so great a price. But kings today, confined within the limits of probability, no longer possess the audacity of willpower. They are afraid of the ears that listen to their orders and the eyes that watch whatever they do. They no longer have any sense of the superiority of their divine being: they are men who wear crowns, nothing more. At one time they would have believed themselves (or, at least, have claimed to be) the sons of Jupiter, and their manners would somehow have reflected those of their father, the god: what happens beyond the clouds is not so easily controlled, but nowadays kings are well within reach. And, as despotic governments have always been loath to exhibit the effects of prison and torture in broad daylight – just as there are few instances of a victim of the Inquisition emerging with broken bones and bleeding wounds – so folly, that ulcer conceived in the mire of dungeons as a result of moral torture, almost always remains carefully hidden in the place of its birth, or else, if it should emerge, does so only to be buried once more in some dark hospital whose doctors can recognize neither the man nor his ideas in the shapeless wreck","Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither courage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the eye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are not inviolable. It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him."

"Dantès était à moitié soldat; questionner des subordonnés auxquels il était défendu de répondre lui parut une chose absurde, et il se tut. Alors les pensées les plus étranges passèrent par son esprit: comme on ne pouvait faire une longue route dans une pareille barque, comme il n'y avait aucun bâtiment à l'ancre du côté où l'on se rendait, il pensa qu'on allait le déposer sur un point éloigné de la côte et lui dire qu'il était libre; il n'était point attaché, on n'avait fait aucune tentative pour lui mettre les menottes, cela lui paraissait d'un bon augure; d'ailleurs le substitut, si excellent pour lui, ne lui avait-il pas dit que, pourvu qu'il ne prononçât point ce nom fatal de Noirtier, il n'avait rien à craindre? Villefort n'avait-il pas, en sa présence, anéanti cette dangereuse lettre, seule preuve qu'il eût contre lui? Il attendit donc, muet et pensif, et essayant de percer, avec cet œil du marin exercé aux ténèbres et accoutumé à l'espace, l'obscurité de la nuit. On avait laissé à droite l'île Ratonneau, où brûlait un phare, et tout en longeant presque la côte, on était arrivé à la hauteur de l'anse des Catalans. Là, les regards du prisonnier redoublèrent d'énergie: c'était là qu'était Mercédès, et il lui semblait à chaque instant voir se dessiner sur le rivage sombre la forme vague et indécise d'une femme.","Dantès was half a soldier; to question subordinates to whom it was forbidden to answer seemed to him an absurd thing, and he was silent. Then the strangest thoughts passed through his mind: as one could not travel a long way in such a boat, as there was no ship at anchor on the side where one was going, he thought that one was going to drop him off at a distant point on the coast and tell him he was free; he was not attached, no attempt had been made to handcuff him, that seemed to him a good omen; besides, had not the substitute, so excellent to him, told him that, provided he did not pronounce that fatal name of Noirtier, he had nothing to fear? Had not Villefort, in his presence, annihilated this dangerous letter, the only proof he had against him? So he waited, mute and pensive, and trying to pierce, with that eye of a sailor trained in darkness and accustomed to space, the darkness of the night. We had left Île Ratonneau on the right, where a lighthouse was burning, and almost skirting the coast, we had reached the Anse des Catalans. There the prisoner's eyes redoubled their energy: it was there that Mercedes was, and it seemed to him at every moment that he saw the vague and indecisive form of a woman taking shape on the dark shore.","Being half a soldier himself, Dantès knew that it was ridiculous to ask questions of subordinates who had been forbidden to reply, so he kept silent. However, the strangest ideas crowded through his brain. Since they could not go far in a boat of this size, and there was no ship at anchor in the direction towards which they were heading, he thought that they must be going to put him ashore on some distant part of the coast and tell him he was free. He was not bound, and no attempt had been made to handcuff him: this seemed like a good sign. In any case, had not the deputy prosecutor told him that, provided he did not mention the dread name of Noirtier, he had nothing to fear? Had not Villefort, in his very presence, destroyed the dangerous letter which was the only proof they had against him? So he waited, silent and deep in thought, trying to penetrate the blackness of night with his sailor’s eye, accustomed to darkness and familiar with space. On their right, they had left behind the Ile Ratonneau, with its lighthouse, and, almost following the line of the coast, they had arrived opposite the bay of the Catalans. Here, the prisoner looked with still greater intensity: here Mercédès lived and he felt at every instant that he could see the vague and ill-defined shape of a woman on the dark shore.","Dantes, trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent. The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him? He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness. They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercedes dwelt."

"En un instant, tous les alentours du coffre furent déblayés, et Dantès vit tour à tour apparaître la serrure du milieu, placée entre deux cadenas, et les anses des faces latérales; tout cela était ciselé comme on ciselait à cette époque, où l'art rendait précieux les plus vils métaux.","In an instant, all the surroundings of the coffer were cleared away, and Dantès saw in turn appear the lock in the middle, placed between two padlocks, and the handles of the side faces; all this was chiseled as one chiseled at that time, when art made the vilest metals precious.","In a moment he had cleared all round the casket and revealed by turns the lock in the middle, between two padlocks, and the handles at each end.

"Villefort était demeuré debout, malgré la chute de son supérieur, et son mariage, en restant décidé, était cependant remis à des temps plus heureux.

If the emperor should keep his throne, then Gérard would need to marry into another family and his father would find a suitable match for him. If Louis XVIII returned to France under a second Restoration, M. de Saint-Méran’s influence and his own would be greatly increased, and the union become more favourable to him than ever.","Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity.

Morrel, et était resté dans la maison quoi qu'eussent pu faire ses parents pour l'en retirer; l'autre était un vieux garçon de caisse, borgne, nommé Coclès, sobriquet que lui avaient donné les jeunes gens qui peuplaient autrefois cette grande ruche bourdonnante, aujourd'hui presque inhabitée, et qui avait si bien et si complètement remplacé son vrai nom, que, selon toute probabilité, il ne se serait pas même retourné, si on l'eût appelé aujourd'hui de ce nom.","Instead of that air of life, ease and happiness which exhales, so to speak, from a house on the way to prosperity; instead of those joyful faces showing themselves behind the curtains of the windows, of those busy clerks crossing the corridors, a feather stuck behind their ear; instead of this yard cluttered with bundles, resounding with the cries and laughter of the postmen; he would have found, at the first sight, something sad and deadly. In this deserted corridor and in this empty courtyard, numerous employees who formerly populated the offices, only two had remained: one was a young man of twenty-three or twenty-four, named Emmanuel Raymond, who was in love with the daughter of M. Morrel, and had remained in the house whatever her parents might have done to get her out of it; the other was an old, one-eyed cashier, named Cocles, a nickname given to him by the young people who once populated that great buzzing hive, now almost uninhabited, and who had so completely and completely replaced his real name, that, in all probability, he would not even have turned round, if he had been called by that name today.","In place of that relaxed atmosphere of life and good cheer that seems to be, so to speak, exhaled by a firm enjoying prosperity; in place of the happy faces looking out of the windows and the busy clerks hurrying down the corridors with pens behind their ears; in place of the courtyard full of boxes, resounding to the shouts and laughter of the delivery men; in place of all this, from the moment he came in, he would have found an indefinable air of sadness and death. The corridor was empty, the courtyard deserted; and, of all the many employees who had once crowded into the offices, only two remained: the first was a young man, aged about twenty-three or twenty-four, named Emmanuel Herbault, who was in love with M. Morrel’s daughter and had stayed with the firm despite his relatives’ efforts to extricate him; while the other was an old cashier, one-eyed, nicknamed Coclès by the young people who had once populated this vast, busy hive which was now almost uninhabited, a label that had now so completely and utterly replaced any previous ones, that in all probability he would not even have turned around if someone were to have called him by his true name.","Instead of that air of life, of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment — instead of merry faces at the windows, busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors — instead of the court filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of three or four and twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel's daughter, and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called ""Cocles,"" or ""Cock-eye,"" a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability, have replied to any one who addressed him by it."

"Il le fit comme il s'était promis de le faire. Deux fois le jour, par la petite ouverture grillée qui ne lui laissait apercevoir que le ciel, il jetait ses vivres, d'abord gaiement, puis avec réflexion, puis avec regret; il lui fallut le souvenir du serment qu'il s'était fait pour avoir la force de poursuivre ce terrible dessein. Ces aliments, qui lui répugnaient autrefois, la faim, aux dents aiguës, les lui faisait paraître appétissants à l'œil et exquis à l'odorat; quelquefois, il tenait pendant une heure à sa main le plat qui le contenait, l'œil fixé sur ce morceau de viande pourrie ou sur ce poisson infect, et sur ce pain noir et moisi. C'étaient les derniers instincts de la vie qui luttaient encore en lui et qui de temps en temps terrassaient sa résolution. Alors son cachot ne lui paraissait plus aussi sombre, son état lui semblait moins désespéré; il était jeune encore; il devait avoir vingt-cinq ou vingt-six ans, il lui restait cinquante ans à vivre à peu près, c'est-à-dire deux fois ce qu'il avait vécu. Pendant ce laps de temps immense, que d'événements pouvaient forcer les portes, renverser les murailles du château d'If et le rendre à la liberté! Alors, il approchait ses dents du repas que, Tantale volontaire, il éloignait lui-même de sa bouche; mais alors le souvenir de son serment lui revenait à l'esprit, et cette généreuse nature avait trop peur de se mépriser soi-même pour manquer à son serment. Il usa donc, rigoureux et impitoyable, le peu d'existence qui lui restait, et un jour vint où il n'eut plus la force de se lever pour jeter par la lucarne le souper qu'on lui apportait.","He did it as he had promised himself to do. Twice a day, through the little grilled opening which allowed him to see only the sky, he threw down his provisions, first cheerfully, then with reflection, then with regret; he needed the memory of the oath he had made to himself to have the strength to pursue this terrible design. These foods, which had formerly been repugnant to him, hunger, with sharp teeth, made them seem appetizing to the eye and exquisite to the smell; sometimes he held the dish in his hand for an hour, his eye fixed on that piece of rotten meat or that foul fish, and that black, moldy bread. It was the last instincts of life which still struggled within him and which from time to time crushed his resolve. Then his dungeon no longer seemed so gloomy to him, his state seemed to him less hopeless; he was still young; he must have been twenty-five or twenty-six, he had about fifty years left to live, that is to say, twice what he had lived. During this immense lapse of time, how many events could force open the doors, overthrow the walls of the Chateau d'If and restore it to freedom! Then he brought his teeth closer to the meal which, Tantalus voluntarily, he himself removed from his mouth; but then the memory of her oath returned to her mind, and this generous nature was too afraid of despising herself to break her oath. So he used up, rigorously and pitilessly, the little life he had left, and a day came when he no longer had the strength to get up to throw the supper they brought him through the skylight.","He did as he had promised. Twice a day, he threw his food out of the little barred opening which gave him no more than a glimpse of the sky, first joyfully, then thoughtfully and finally with regret. He had to remind himself of the oath he had sworn to find the strength to pursue his awful resolution. Seen with the eyes of hunger, this food, which had formerly disgusted him, appeared appetizing to look at and smelled exquisite. Sometimes he held the plate containing it for an hour in his hand, staring at the piece of rotten meat or repulsive fish, and the mouldy black bread. The last instinct of survival struggled within him and occasionally defeated his resolve. At such times, his dungeon seemed less dark and his situation less desperate. He was still young, he must be about twenty-five or twenty-six, so he had roughly fifty years left to live, that is to say twice as long as he had lived so far. In this vast expanse of time, how many different events might unlock the doors and break down the walls of the Château d’If, and set him free! At such times he put his lips towards the meal that, like a deliberate Tantalus, he was snatching from his own mouth. But then he would remember the oath which his nature was too generous to break for fear that he might end by despising himself. So, firm and implacable, he summoned up the little remnant of life that remained to him, until the day came when they brought him his supper and he was too weak to get up and throw it out of the window.","He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture, the provisions his jailer brought him — at first gayly, then with deliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young — he was only four or five and twenty — he had nearly fifty years to live. What unforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to liberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole."

"Ainsi, ce furent pour les deux infortunés, sinon d'heureux jours, du moins des jours assez promptement écoulés que les jours qui suivirent. Faria, qui pendant de si longues années avait gardé le silence sur le trésor, en reparlait maintenant à toute occasion. Comme il l'avait prévu, il était resté paralysé du bras droit et de la jambe gauche, et avait à peu près perdu tout espoir d'en jouir lui-même; mais il rêvait toujours pour son jeune compagnon une délivrance ou une évasion, et il en jouissait pour lui. De peur que la lettre ne fût un jour égarée ou perdue, il avait forcé Dantès de l'apprendre par cœur, et Dantès la savait depuis le premier jusqu'au dernier mot. Alors il avait détruit la seconde partie, certain qu'on pouvait retrouver et saisir la première sans en deviner le véritable sens. Quelquefois, des heures entières se passèrent pour Faria à donner des instructions à Dantès, instructions qui devaient lui servir au jour de sa liberté. Alors, une fois libre, du jour, de l'heure, du moment où il serait libre, il ne devait plus avoir qu'une seule et unique pensée, gagner Monte-Cristo par un moyen quelconque, y rester seul sous un prétexte qui ne donnât point de soupçons, et, une fois là, une fois seul, tâcher de retrouver les grottes merveilleuses et fouiller l'endroit indiqué. L'endroit indiqué, on se le rappelle, c'est l'angle le plus éloigné de la seconde ouverture.","Thus, for the two unfortunates, it was, if not happy days, at least days passed rather quickly than the days that followed. Faria, who for so many years had kept silent about the treasure, now spoke of it whenever possible. As he had foreseen, he had been left paralyzed in the right arm and left leg, and had almost lost all hope of enjoying it himself; but he always dreamed of deliverance or escape for his young companion, and he enjoyed it for himself. For fear that the letter might one day be misplaced or lost, he had forced Dantès to learn it by heart, and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. So he had destroyed the second part, certain that one could find and grasp the first without guessing its true meaning. Sometimes whole hours passed for Faria giving instructions to Dantès, instructions which were to serve him on the day of his freedom. So, once free, from the day, from the hour, from the moment when he would be free, he was to have only one and only thought, to reach Monte-Cristo by some means or other, to remain there alone under a pretext which did not give rise to suspicions, and, once there, once alone, try to find the marvelous caves and search the place indicated. The place indicated, it will be remembered, is the angle furthest from the second opening.","For the two unfortunates, these days, if not exactly happy, did at least speed past as quickly as those that followed. Faria, who had kept silent about the treasure for many years, now spoke incessantly about it. As he had predicted, he remained paralysed in the right arm and left leg, and had almost lost any hope of being able to enjoy the fortune himself, but he continually dreamed that his young companion might be freed, or escape, and would enjoy it for him. Fearing that the letter might be mislaid or lost one day, he obliged Dantès to learn it by heart; and, since the first day, Dantès had known it from the first word to the last. Then he destroyed the second half, convinced that if the first was found, no one would be able to understand its true meaning. Sometimes whole hours passed in which Faria gave Dantès instructions, to be carried out when he was free. And, once he was free, from the very day, hour, instant of his freedom, he must have no thought except that of somehow reaching Monte Cristo, remaining alone there under some pretext and, once there, once alone, trying to find the wonderful grottoes and searching the spot indicated in the letter: this, you may remember, was the furthest angle of the second opening.","Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantes to learn it by heart; and Dantes knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantes, — instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot, — the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening."

"Louis XVIII n'essaya que faiblement de parer ce coup si rude: son peu de confiance dans les hommes lui ôtait sa confiance dans les événements. La royauté, ou plutôt la monarchie, à peine reconstituée par lui, trembla sur sa base encore incertaine, et un seul geste de l'Empereur fit crouler tout cet édifice mélange informe de vieux préjugés et d'idées nouvelles. Villefort n'eut donc de son roi qu'une reconnaissance non seulement inutile pour le moment, mais même dangereuse, et cette croix d'officier de la Légion d'honneur, qu'il eut la prudence de ne pas montrer, quoique M. de Blacas, comme le lui avait recommandé le roi, lui en eût fait soigneusement expédier le brevet.","Louis XVIII made only a weak attempt to parry this harsh blow: his lack of confidence in men deprived him of his confidence in events. Royalty, or rather the monarchy, scarcely reconstituted by him, trembled on its still uncertain foundation, and a single gesture from the Emperor brought down the whole edifice, a shapeless mixture of old prejudices and new ideas. Villefort therefore only received from his king a recognition that was not only useless for the moment, but even dangerous, and this cross of officer of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to show, although M. de Blacas, as the King had recommended to him, would have had the patent carefully despatched to him.","Louis XVIII made only feeble efforts to ward off this terrible blow: his lack of confidence in men deprived him of any confidence in events. Kingship or, rather, the monarchy, which he had barely rebuilt, was already trembling on its uncertain foundations and a single gesture from the emperor brought the entire edifice crashing down, a shapeless compound of old prejudices and new ideas. So Villefort received nothing from his king except gratitude, and that was not only useless for the time being, but actually dangerous; and the cross of the Legion of Honour which he was wise enough not to display, even though M. de Blacas had done as the king required and duly sent him the certificate.","Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort, therefore, gained nothing save the king's gratitude (which was rather likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet."

"Ce délai accordé par le mandataire de la maison Thomson et French, au moment où Morrel s'y attendait le moins, parut au pauvre armateur un de ces retours de bonheur qui annoncent à l'homme que le sort s'est enfin lassé de s'acharner sur lui. Le même jour, il raconta ce qui lui était arrivé à sa fille, à sa femme et à Emmanuel, et un peu d'espérance, sinon de tranquillité, rentra dans la famille. Mais malheureusement, Morrel n'avait pas seulement affaire à la maison Thomson et French, qui s'était montrée envers lui de si bonne composition. Comme il l'avait dit, dans le commerce on a des correspondants et pas d'amis. Lorsqu'il songeait profondément, il ne comprenait même pas cette conduite généreuse de MM. Thomson et French envers lui; il ne se l'expliquait que par cette réflexion intelligemment égoïste que cette maison aurait faite: Mieux vaut soutenir un homme qui nous doit près de trois cent mille francs, et avoir ces trois cent mille francs au bout de trois mois, que de hâter sa ruine et avoir six ou huit pour cent du capital.","This delay granted by the representative of the firm of Thomson and French, at the moment when Morrel least expected it, seemed to the poor shipowner one of those returns of happiness which announce to the man that fate has finally tired of s hound him. The same day he related what had happened to his daughter, his wife and Emmanuel, and a little hope, if not tranquility, returned to the family. But unfortunately, Morrel had to deal not only with the house of Thomson and French, who had shown themselves to be of such good character towards him. As he had said, in business you have correspondents and no friends. When he thought deeply, he did not even understand this generous conduct of MM. Thomson and French towards him; he explained it to himself only by this intelligently selfish reflection that this house would have made: Better to support a man who owes us nearly three hundred thousand francs, and to have these three hundred thousand francs at the end of three months, than to hasten his ruin and have six or eight percent of the capital.","The stay granted by the representative of Thomson and French, just when M. Morrel least expected it, seemed to the poor shipowner like one of those changes of fortune which tell a man that fate has at last tired of hounding him. The same day, he told his daughter, his wife and Emmanuel what had happened, and a modicum of hope, if not peace of mind, descended on the family. But unfortunately Morrel did not only have to deal with Thomson and French, who appeared so well disposed towards him. As he himself said, in business one has associates, but no friends. When he thought seriously about it, he could not even understand the generosity of Messrs Thomson and French. The only explanation he could find was that the firm had made the following self-interested calculation: it is better to support a man who owes us nearly three hundred thousand francs, and have the money at the end of three months, than to precipitate his ruin and have only six or eight per cent of the original sum.","The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same day he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred; and a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family. Unfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards him; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not friends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: — ""We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again.

"—On ne peut plus sérieusement, mademoiselle, reprit le jeune magistrat, le sourire sur les lèvres. Et avec ces beaux procès que désire mademoiselle pour satisfaire sa curiosité, et que je désire, moi, pour satisfaire mon ambition, la situation ne fera que s'aggraver. Tous ces soldats de Napoléon, habitués à aller en aveugles à l'ennemi, croyez-vous qu'ils réfléchissent en brûlant une cartouche ou en marchant à la baïonnette? Eh bien, réfléchiront-ils davantage pour tuer un homme qu'ils croient leur ennemi personnel, que pour tuer un Russe, un Autrichien ou un Hongrois qu'ils n'ont jamais vu? D'ailleurs il faut cela, voyez-vous; sans quoi notre métier n'aurait point d'excuse. Moi-même, quand je vois luire dans l'œil de l'accusé l'éclair lumineux de la rage, je me sens tout encouragé, je m'exalte: ce n'est plus un procès, c'est un combat; je lutte contre lui, il riposte, je redouble, et le combat finit, comme tous les combats, par une victoire ou une défaite. Voilà ce que c'est que de plaider! c'est le danger qui fait l'éloquence. Un accusé qui me sourirait après ma réplique me ferait croire que j'ai parlé mal, que ce que j'ai dit est pâle, sans vigueur, insuffisant. Songez donc à la sensation d'orgueil qu'éprouve un procureur du roi, convaincu de la culpabilité de l'accusé, lorsqu'il voit blêmir et s'incliner son coupable sous le poids des preuves et sous les foudres de son éloquence! Cette tête se baisse, elle tombera.»","""We can't be more serious, Mademoiselle,"" resumed the young magistrate, a smile on his lips. And with these beautiful lawsuits that mademoiselle wants to satisfy her curiosity, and that I want to satisfy my ambition, the situation will only get worse. All these soldiers of Napoleon, accustomed to going blind to the enemy, do you believe that they reflect while burning a cartridge or while marching with bayonets? Well, will they think more about killing a man whom they believe to be their personal enemy, than about killing a Russian, an Austrian or a Hungarian whom they have never seen? Besides, you need that, you see; otherwise our profession would have no excuse. Myself, when I see the luminous flash of rage shining in the eye of the accused, I feel completely encouraged, I am exalted: it is no longer a trial, it is a combat; I fight against him, he retaliates, I redouble, and the fight ends, like all fights, in a victory or a defeat. This is what it is to plead! it is the danger that makes the eloquence. A defendant who smiled at me after my reply would have me believe that I spoke badly, that what I said was pale, without vigor, insufficient. Think, then, of the feeling of pride felt by a public prosecutor, convinced of the guilt of the accused, when he sees his culprit blanch and bow under the weight of the proofs and the wrath of his eloquence! This head bows, it will fall.”","‘I could not be more serious, Mademoiselle,’ the young magistrate said with a smile. ‘And the situation can only get worse with these fine trials that the young lady requires to satisfy her curiosity and which I require to satisfy my ambition. Do you imagine that all these soldiers of Napoleon’s, who are accustomed to walk blindly in the direction of the enemy, pause to think before firing a shot or marching forward with fixed bayonets? And, in that case, will they hesitate to kill a man whom they consider their personal foe, any more than they would to kill a Russian, an Austrian or a Hungarian whom they have never set eyes on? In any case, you understand, this is as it should be, because without it there would be no excuse for my profession. As for me, when I see a bright spark of hatred shining in the eye of an accused man, I feel encouraged, I rejoice: it is no longer a trial, but a duel. I go for him, he ripostes, I press harder, and the fight ends, like all fights, in victory or defeat. That is what advocacy means! That is the risk run by eloquence. If a defendant were to smile at me after my speech, he would make me feel that I had spoken poorly, that what I had said was bland, inadequate and lacking in vigour. Imagine the feeling of pride a crown prosecutor experiences when he is convinced of the defendant’s guilt and sees the guilty man go pale and bend under the weight of his evidence and the blast of his oratory! The head is lowered; it will fall.’","""Indeed I am,"" replied the young magistrate with a smile; ""and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon — well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one's self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence."""

"Ceux qui, comme moi, ont parcouru à pied le Midi de la France ont pu remarquer entre Bellegarde et Beaucaire, à moitié chemin à peu près du village à la ville, mais plus rapprochée cependant de Beaucaire que de Bellegarde, une petite auberge où pend, sur une plaque de tôle qui grince au moindre vent, une grotesque représentation du pont du Gard. Cette petite auberge, en prenant pour règle le cours du Rhône, est située au côté gauche de la route, tournant le dos au fleuve; elle est accompagnée de ce que dans le Languedoc on appelle un jardin: c'est-à-dire que la face opposée à celle qui ouvre sa porte aux voyageurs donne sur un enclos où rampent quelques oliviers rabougris et quelques figuiers sauvages au feuillage argenté par la poussière; dans leurs intervalles poussent, pour tout légume, des aulx, des piments et des échalotes; enfin, à l'un de ses angles, comme une sentinelle oubliée, un grand pin parasol élance mélancoliquement sa tige flexible, tandis que sa cime, épanouie en éventail, craque sous un soleil de trente degrés.","Those who, like me, have traveled the South of France on foot have noticed between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, roughly halfway from the village to the town, but closer, however, to Beaucaire than to Bellegarde, a small inn where hangs , on a sheet metal plate that creaks in the slightest wind, a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This little inn, taking the course of the Rhone as its rule, is situated on the left side of the road, with its back to the river; it is accompanied by what in Languedoc is called a garden: that is to say that the face opposite to that which opens its door to travelers overlooks an enclosure where a few stunted olive trees and a few wild fig trees with silvery foliage crawl dust; in their intervals grow, for every vegetable, garlic, peppers and shallots; finally, at one of its corners, like a forgotten sentinel, a large umbrella pine melancholy thrusts up its flexible stem, while its fan-shaped crown cracks under a thirty-degree sun.","Those who have walked across the south of France, as I have done, may have noticed an inn, situated between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, roughly half-way between the village and the town (though rather closer to Beaucaire than to Bellegarde), outside which hangs a crude painting of the Pont du Gard on a metal plate which creaks at the slightest breath of wind. This little inn, lying parallel to the course of the Rhône, is situated on the left side of the road with its back to the river. It has what in Languedoc is described as a garden: that is to say that the side opposite the one through which travellers enter overlooks an enclosure in which a few stunted olive-trees lurk beside some wild figs, their leaves silvered with dust. Between them, the only vegetables that grow here are some heads of garlic, some peppers and some shallots. Finally, in one corner, like a forgotten sentry, a tall umbrella pine rises in melancholy fashion on its pliable trunk, while its crest, fanned out, blisters under thirty degrees of sunshine.","Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde, — a little nearer to the former than to the latter, — a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhone. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict."

"Comme il se relevait, un éclair qui semblait ouvrir le ciel jusqu'au pied du trône éblouissant de Dieu illumina l'espace; à la lueur de cet éclair, entre l'île Lemaire et le cap Croisille, à un quart de lieue de lui, Dantès vit apparaître, comme un spectre glissant du haut d'une vague dans un abîme, un petit bâtiment pêcheur emporté à la fois par l'orage et par le flot; une seconde après, à la cime d'une autre vague, le fantôme reparut, s'approchant avec une effroyable rapidité. Dantès voulut crier, chercha quelque lambeau de linge à agiter en l'air pour leur faire voir qu'ils se perdaient, mais ils le voyaient bien eux-mêmes. À la lueur d'un autre éclair, le jeune homme vit quatre hommes cramponnés aux mâts et aux étais; un cinquième se tenait à la barre du gouvernail brisé. Ces hommes qu'il voyait le virent aussi sans doute, car des cris désespérés, emportés par la rafale sifflante, arrivèrent à son oreille. Au-dessus du mât, tordu comme un roseau, claquait en l'air, à coups précipités, une voile en lambeaux; tout à coup les liens qui la retenaient encore se rompirent, et elle disparut, emportée dans les sombres profondeurs du ciel, pareille à ces grands oiseaux blancs qui se dessinent sur les nuages noirs.","As he rose, a flash of lightning which seemed to open the sky to the foot of the dazzling throne of God illumined space; by the light of this flash, between Île Lemaire and Cap Croisille, a quarter of a league from him, Dantès saw appear, like a specter sliding from the top of a wave into an abyss, a small fishing vessel carried to the shore. both by the storm and by the flood; a second later, at the top of another wave, the phantom reappeared, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantès wanted to shout, looked for some shred of linen to wave in the air to show them that they were lost, but they could see it themselves. By the light of another flash, the young man saw four men clinging to the masts and stays; a fifth stood at the helm of the broken rudder. Those men he saw saw him too, no doubt, for desperate cries, carried away by the whistling gust, reached his ear. Above the mast, twisted like a reed, flapped in the air, with hasty blows, a tattered sail; Suddenly the bonds that still bound her broke, and she disappeared, carried away into the dark depths of the sky, like those great white birds that stand out against the black clouds.","As he was lifting his head, a shaft of lightning, which seemed to crack open the heavens as far as the foot of God’s radiant throne, lit up the scene. By its light Dantès saw a little fishing boat appear, like a phantom slipping from the crest of a wave into the abyss, driven forward both by the waves and by the storm, between the Ile Lemaire and the Cap Croisille, a quarter of a league away from him. A second later the phantom reappeared on the crest of another wave, coming towards him at fearful speed. Dantès wanted to shout; he looked for a scrap of cloth that he could wave in the air, to show them that they were heading for destruction, but they could see it perfectly well for themselves. In the light of another shaft of lightning the young man saw four men hanging on to the masts and the rigging, while a fifth held the bar of a broken helm. No doubt these men whom he saw could also see him, for desperate cries were carried across to him on the whistling gusts. Above the mast, twisted like a reed, a tattered sail was flapping rapidly over and over against the air. Suddenly, the ropes that still held it broke and it vanished, carried away into the dark depths of the sky, like a great white bird silhouetted against a black cloud.","As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantes saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantes cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird."

"Cependant ce bâtiment s'avançait; il avait heureusement franchi le détroit que quelque secousse volcanique a creusé entre l'île de Calasareigne et l'île de Jaros; il avait doublé Pomègue, et il s'avançait sous ses trois huniers, son grand foc et sa brigantine, mais si lentement et d'une allure si triste, que les curieux, avec cet instinct qui pressent un malheur, se demandaient quel accident pouvait être arrivé à bord. Néanmoins les experts en navigation reconnaissaient que si un accident était arrivé, ce ne pouvait être au bâtiment lui-même; car il s'avançait dans toutes les conditions d'un navire parfaitement gouverné: son ancre était en mouillage, ses haubans de beaupré décrochés; et près du pilote, qui s'apprêtait à diriger le Pharaon par l'étroite entrée du port de Marseille, était un jeune homme au geste rapide et à l'œil actif, qui surveillait chaque mouvement du navire et répétait chaque ordre du pilote.","However, this building advanced; he had fortunately crossed the strait which some volcanic shock had dug between the island of Calasareigne and the island of Jaros; he had passed Pomègue, and he was advancing under his three topsails, his main jib and his brigantine, but so slowly and with such a sad gait, that the curious, with that instinct which foresees misfortune, wondered what accident could have happened. to have arrived on board. Nevertheless, navigation experts recognized that if an accident had happened, it could not be to the vessel itself; for she was advancing under all the conditions of a perfectly steered ship: her anchor was at anchor, her bowsprit shrouds unhooked; and near the pilot, who was about to steer the Pharaoh through the narrow entrance to the port of Marseilles, was a quick-moving, active-eyed young man, who watched every movement of the ship and repeated every order of the pilot.","Meanwhile the ship was drawing near, and had successfully negotiated the narrows created by some volcanic upheaval between the islands of Calseraigne and Jarre; it had rounded Pomègue and was proceeding under its three topsails, its outer jib and its spanker, but so slowly and with such melancholy progress that the bystanders, instinctively sensing some misfortune, wondered what accident could have occurred on board. Nevertheless, those who were experts in nautical matters acknowledged that, if there had been such an accident, it could not have affected the vessel itself, for its progress gave every indication of a ship under perfect control: the anchor was ready to drop and the bowsprit shrouds loosed. Next to the pilot, who was preparing to guide the Pharaon through the narrow entrance to the port of Marseille, stood a young man, alert and sharp-eyed, supervising every movement of the ship and repeating each of the pilot’s commands.","The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomegue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot."

"Mais depuis cette fin de mois si victorieusement accomplie, M. Morrel avait passé de cruelles heures; pour faire face à cette fin de mois, il avait réuni toutes ses ressources, et lui-même, craignant que le bruit de sa détresse ne se répandît dans Marseille, lorsqu'on le verrait recourir à de pareilles extrémités, avait fait un voyage à la foire de Beaucaire pour vendre quelques bijoux appartenant à sa femme et à sa fille, et une partie de son argenterie. Moyennant ce sacrifice, tout s'était encore cette fois passé au plus grand honneur de la maison Morrel; mais la caisse était demeurée complètement vide. Le crédit, effrayé par le bruit qui courait, s'était retiré avec son égoïsme habituel; et pour faire face aux cent mille francs à rembourser le 15 du présent mois à M. de Boville, et aux autres cent mille francs qui allaient échoir le 15 du mois suivant. M. Morrel n'avait en réalité que l'espérance du retour du Pharaon, dont un bâtiment qui avait levé l'ancre en même temps que lui, et qui était arrivé à bon port, avait appris le départ.","But since this end of the month so victoriously accomplished, M. Morrel had passed cruel hours; to meet the end of the month, he had collected all his resources, and he himself, fearing that the report of his distress would spread in Marseilles, when he was seen to resort to such extremities, had made a trip to the Beaucaire fair to sell some jewelry belonging to his wife and daughter, and some of his silverware. In consideration of this sacrifice, everything had again this time passed to the greatest honor of the Morrel house; but the box had remained completely empty. Credit, frightened by the current rumor, had withdrawn with its usual selfishness; and to meet the hundred thousand francs to be reimbursed on the 15th of the present month to M. de Boville, and the other hundred thousand francs which were to fall due on the 15th of the following month. M. Morrel had in reality only the hope of the return of the Pharaoh, of whom a ship which had weighed anchor at the same time as him, and which had arrived safely, had learned of the departure.","However, since achieving this victory over the end-of-month payments, M. Morrel had suffered some moments of agony. It had meant mustering all his resources. Fearful that the rumour concerning his difficulties might spread through the town if he was seen to be turning to such extremities, he had travelled in person to the fair at Beaucaire to sell some jewellery belonging to his wife and daughter, and part of his silver. As a result of this sacrifice, the reputation of the house of Morrel had been spared the slightest hint of a stain, but the cashbox was totally empty. With its usual egoism, all credit had slipped away, terrified by the rumours: the truth was that if he was to meet the hundred thousand francs which he would owe M. de Boville on the 15th of the present month, and the second hundred thousand francs which would fall due on the 15th of the month following, M. Morrel’s only hope lay in the return of the Pharaon, which had certainly set sail, as they knew from another ship which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had come safely to port.","But since the end of the month M. Morrel had passed many an anxious hour. In order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his resources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wife's and daughter's jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means the end of the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted. Credit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 10th of the present month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M. de Boville, M.

"À peine de Villefort fut-il hors de la salle à manger qu'il quitta son masque joyeux pour prendre l'air grave d'un homme appelé à cette suprême fonction de prononcer sur la vie de son semblable. Or, malgré la mobilité de sa physionomie, mobilité que le substitut avait, comme doit faire un habile acteur, plus d'une fois étudiée devant sa glace, ce fut cette fois un travail pour lui que de froncer son sourcil et d'assombrir ses traits. En effet, à part le souvenir de cette ligne politique suivie par son père, et qui pouvait, s'il ne s'en éloignait complètement, faire dévier son avenir, Gérard de Villefort était en ce moment aussi heureux qu'il est donné à un homme de le devenir; déjà riche par lui-même, il occupait à vingt-sept ans une place élevée dans la magistrature, il épousait une jeune et belle personne qu'il aimait, non pas passionnément, mais avec raison, comme un substitut du procureur du roi peut aimer, et outre sa beauté, qui était remarquable, Mlle de Saint-Méran, sa fiancée, appartenait à une des familles les mieux en cour de l'époque; et outre l'influence de son père et de sa mère, qui, n'ayant point d'autre enfant, pouvaient la conserver tout entière à leur gendre, elle apportait encore à son mari une dot de cinquante mille écus, qui, grâce aux espérances, ce mot atroce inventé par les entremetteurs de mariage, pouvait s'augmenter un jour d'un héritage d'un demi-million.","No sooner had De Villefort left the dining room than he took off his cheerful mask to assume the grave air of a man called to this supreme function of pronouncing on the life of his fellow man. Now, in spite of the mobility of his countenance, mobility which the substitute had, as a skilful actor must do, more than once studied in front of his mirror, this time it was a job for him to frown his eyebrows and darken his eyes. features. Indeed, apart from the memory of this political line followed by his father, and which could, if he did not move away from it completely, derail his future, Gérard de Villefort was at this moment as happy as he is given to a man to become; already rich by himself, he occupied at twenty-seven years a high place in the magistracy, he married a young and beautiful person whom he loved, not passionately, but with reason, as a deputy of the king's prosecutor can love , and besides her beauty, which was remarkable, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, his fiancée, belonged to one of the best families at court at the time; and besides the influence of her father and her mother, who, having no other children, could preserve her entirely for their son-in-law, she also brought her husband a dowry of fifty thousand crowns, which, thanks to the hopes, that atrocious word coined by marriage matchmakers, could one day be augmented by an inheritance of half a million.","Hardly had de Villefort left the dining-room than he put off his joyful mask to take on the serious mien of one called upon to exercise the supreme office of pronouncing on the life of his fellow man. However, despite the mobility of his expression, something which the deputy had studied more than once, as a skilled actor does, in front of his mirror, on this occasion it was an effort for him to lower his brow and darken his features. In reality, apart from the memory of his father’s choice of political allegiance (which, if he did not himself completely renounce it, might affect his own career), Gérard de Villefort was at that moment as happy as it is possible for a man to be. At the age of twenty-six, already wealthy in his own right, he held a high office in the legal profession; and he was to marry a beautiful young woman whom he loved, not with passion, but reasonably, as a deputy crown prosecutor may love. Apart from her beauty, which was exceptional, his fiancée, Mlle de Saint-Méran, belonged to a family which was among those most highly thought of at court in this time; and, besides the influence of her mother and father (who, having no other children, could reserve it entirely for their son-in-law) , she was in addition bringing her husband a dowry of fifty thousand écus which, thanks to her ‘expectations’ – that dreadful word invented by marriage brokers – might one day be increased by a legacy of half a million.","No sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in spite of the mobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gerard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran's family possessed considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father's death."

"—Oh! mon Dieu, c'est bien simple, répondit l'hôte. Il paraît que le drôle avait rôdé plus près du sérail du bey de Tunis qu'il n'était convenable de le faire à un gaillard de sa couleur; de sorte qu'il avait été condamné par le bey à avoir la langue, la main et la tête tranchées: la langue le premier jour, la main le second, et la tête le troisième. J'avais toujours eu envie d'avoir un muet à mon service; j'attendis qu'il eût la langue coupée, et j'allai proposer au bey de me le donner pour un magnifique fusil à deux coups qui, la veille, m'avait paru éveiller les désirs de Sa Hautesse. Il balança un instant, tant il tenait à en finir avec ce pauvre diable. Mais j'ajoutai à ce fusil un couteau de chasse anglais avec lequel j'avais haché le yatagan de Sa Hautesse; de sorte que le bey se décida à lui faire grâce de la main et de la tête, mais à condition qu'il ne remettrait jamais le pied à Tunis. La recommandation était inutile. Du plus loin que le mécréant aperçoit les côtes d'Afrique, il se sauve à fond de cale, et l'on ne peut le faire sortir de là que lorsqu'on est hors de vue de la troisième partie du monde.»","-Oh! my God, it is very simple, replied the host. It seems that the rascal had prowled closer to the seraglio of the Bey of Tunis than it was proper to do to a fellow of his color; so that he had been condemned by the bey to have his tongue, hand, and head cut off: his tongue the first day, his hand the second, and his head the third. I had always wanted to have a mute at my service; I waited until he had his tongue cut out, and I went to propose to the bey to give it to me for a magnificent two-barreled gun which, the day before, had seemed to me to arouse the desires of His Highness. He swayed for a moment, so keen was he to put an end to this poor devil. But I added to this gun an English hunting knife with which I had chopped His Highness's yatagan; so that the bey decided to spare him with his hand and his head, but on condition that he would never set foot in Tunis again. The recommendation was unnecessary. As far as the unbeliever sees the coasts of Africa, he runs away from the bottom of the hold, and you can only get him out of there when you are out of sight of the third part of the world.","‘It’s very simple,’ the host replied. ‘It appears that the fellow had wandered closer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than is acceptable for a lad of his colour. In consequence he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue, his hand and his head cut off: the tongue on the first day, the hand on the second and the head on the third. I had always wanted to have a dumb servant. I waited for him to have his tongue cut out, then I went to offer the bey, in exchange for him, a splendid two-stroke repeating rifle which, on the previous day, had appeared to take His Highness’s fancy. He hesitated a moment, so keen was he to make an end of this poor devil. But I added to the rifle an English hunting knife with which I had blunted His Highness’s yataghan;6 as a result the bey decided to spare him his hand and his head, on condition that he never again set foot in Tunis. The stipulation was unnecessary. As soon as the miscreant catches sight of the African coast, he flees to the bottom of the hold and cannot be persuaded to come out until we have lost sight of the third quarter of the world.’","""Oh, they are simple enough,"" replied the host. ""It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue was cut out, I went to the bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid double-barreled gun which I knew he was very desirous of having. He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil's punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I had shivered his highness's yataghan to pieces, the bey yielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless clause in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe."""
