"L'office fut dépêché en un clin d'œil: le chœur n'était pas, à ce qu'il me parut, l'endroit de la maison où l'on se plaisait le plus. On en sortit avec la vitesse et le babil d'une troupe d'oiseaux qui s'échapperaient de leur volière; et les sœurs se répandirent les unes chez les autres, en courant, en riant, en parlant; la supérieure se renferma dans sa cellule, et la sœur Thérèse s'arrêta sur la porte de la sienne, m'épiant comme si elle eût été curieuse de savoir ce que je deviendrais. Je rentrai chez moi, et la porte de la cellule de la sœur Thérèse ne se referma que quelque temps après, et se referma doucement. Il me vint en idée que cette jeune fille était jalouse de moi, et qu'elle craignait que je ne lui ravisse la place qu'elle occupait dans les bonnes grâces et l'intimité de la supérieure. Je l'observai plusieurs jours de suite; et lorsque je me crus suffisamment assurée de mon soupçon par ses petites colères, ses puériles alarmes, sa persévérance à me suivre à la piste, à m'examiner, à se trouver entre la supérieure et moi, à briser nos entretiens, à déprimer mes qualités, à faire sortir mes défauts; plus encore à sa pâleur, à sa douleur, à ses pleurs, au dérangement de sa santé, et même de son esprit, je l'allai trouver et je lui dis: «Chère amie, qu'avez-vous?»","The service was dispatched in the twinkling of an eye: the choir was not, so it seemed to me, the place in the house where people liked each other the most.

I went home, and the door of Sister Thérèse's cell did not close until some time later, and closed softly.

"Ce fut alors que je sentis la supériorité de la religion chrétienne sur toutes les religions du monde; quelle profonde sagesse il y avait dans ce que l'aveugle philosophie appelle la folie de la croix. Dans l'état où j'étais, de quoi m'aurait servi l'image d'un législateur heureux et comblé de gloire? Je voyais l'innocent, le flanc percé, le front couronné d'épines, les mains et les pieds percés de clous, et expirant dans les souffrances; et je me disais: «Voilà mon Dieu, et j'ose me plaindre!...» Je m'attachai à cette idée, et je sentis la consolation renaître dans mon cœur; je connus la vanité de la vie, et je me trouvai trop heureuse de la perdre, avant que d'avoir eu le temps de multiplier mes fautes. Cependant je comptais mes années, je trouvais que j'avais à peine vingt ans, et je soupirais; j'étais trop affaiblie, trop abattue, pour que mon esprit pût s'élever au-dessus des terreurs de la mort; en pleine santé, je crois que j'aurais pu me résoudre avec plus de courage.","It was then that I felt the superiority of the Christian religion over all the religions of the world; what profound wisdom there was in what blind philosophy calls the folly of the cross.

However, I counted my years, I found that I was barely twenty, and I sighed; I was too weak, too dejected, for my spirit to rise above the terrors of death; in full health, I believe that I could have resolved myself with more courage.","It was then that I came to feel that Christianity was superior to all the other religions in the world.

I knew the vanity of life and found myself only too happy to lose it rather than have the time to commit yet more sins. But I counted up my years and, realizing that I was barely twenty years old, I sighed. I was too weak and exhausted for my mind to rise above the horror of death.

"—Parce qu'alors je serai sous la protection des lois: il faudra me représenter; je serai, pour ainsi dire, entre le monde et le cloître; j'aurai la bouche ouverte, la liberté de me plaindre; je vous attesterai toutes; on n'osera avoir des torts dont je pourrais me plaindre; on n'aura garde de rendre une affaire mauvaise. Je ne demanderais pas mieux qu'on en usât mal avec moi; mais on ne le fera pas: soyez sûre qu'on prendra une conduite tout opposée. On me sollicitera, on me représentera le tort que je vais me faire à moi-même et à la maison; et comptez qu'on n'en viendra aux menaces que quand on aura vu que la douceur et la séduction ne pourront rien, et qu'on s'interdira les voies de force.","“Because then I will be under the protection of the laws: I will have to be represented; I will be, so to speak, between the world and the cloister; I will have my mouth open, the freedom to complain; I will testify to you all; no one will dare to do wrongs of which I could complain; one will be careful not to make a case bad. I wouldn't ask for anything better than they used it badly with me; but we won't do it: you can be sure that we'll take an entirely opposite course. They will appeal to me, they will represent to me the harm I am going to do to myself and to the house; and reckon that we will only come to threats when we have seen that gentleness and seduction will do nothing, and that we will refrain from using force.","‘Because by then I shall be protected by the law. I shall have to appear in person, so I shall be, so to speak, halfway between the world and the cloister.

They’ll appeal to me, they’ll point out to me the wrong that I’m going to do both to myself and to the convent, and you can be sure that they will only resort to threats once they’ve realized that kindness and seduction are useless, and that they’ll refrain from using force.’","‘Because by then I shall be under the protection of the law and I shall have to appear in person.

"J'éprouvai cependant, à l'approche de ma profession, une mélancolie si profonde, qu'elle mit ma bonne supérieure à de terribles épreuves; son talent l'abandonna; elle me l'avoua elle-même. «Je ne sais, me dit-elle, ce qui se passe en moi; il me semble, quand vous venez, que Dieu se retire et que son esprit se taise; c'est inutilement que je m'excite, que je cherche des idées, que je veux exalter mon âme; je me trouve une femme ordinaire et bornée; je crains de parler...» «Ah! chère mère, lui dis-je, quel pressentiment! Si c'était Dieu qui vous rendît muette!...»","I felt, however, at the approach of my profession, such a profound melancholy, that it put my good superior to terrible trials; his talent abandoned him; she confessed it to me herself.

I stir myself, I search for ideas, I try to lift up my soul, but it’s all in vain, for I’m just an ordinary, flawed woman.

Perhaps it’s God who’s preventing you from speaking!...’","And yet, as the time for my profession drew near, I fell into such a deep depression that it put my dear Mother Superior to the severest test.

"J'avais l'âme un peu soulagée. Ma compagne priait droite; moi, je me prosternai; mon front était appuyé contre la dernière marche de l'autel, et mes bras étaient étendus sur les marches supérieures. Je ne crois pas m'être jamais adressée à Dieu avec plus de consolation et de ferveur; le cœur me palpitait avec violence; j'oubliai en un instant tout ce qui m'environnait. Je ne sais combien je restai dans cette position, ni combien j'y serais encore restée; mais je fus un spectacle bien touchant, il le faut croire, pour ma compagne et pour les deux religieuses qui survinrent. Quand je me relevai, je crus être seule; je me trompais; elles étaient toutes les trois placées derrière moi et fondant en larmes: elles n'avaient osé m'interrompre; elles attendaient que je sortisse de moi-même de l'état de transport et d'effusion où elles me voyaient. Quand je me retournai de leur côté, mon visage avait sans doute un caractère bien imposant, si j'en juge par l'effet qu'il produisit sur elles et par ce qu'elles ajoutèrent, que je ressemblais alors à notre ancienne supérieure, lorsqu'elle nous consolait, et que ma vue leur avait causé le même tressaillement. Si j'avais eu quelque penchant à l'hypocrisie ou au fanatisme, et que j'eusse voulu jouer un rôle dans la maison, je ne doute point qu'il ne m'eût réussi. Mon âme s'allume facilement, s'exalte, se touche; et cette bonne supérieure m'a dit cent fois en m'embrassant que personne n'aurait aimé Dieu comme moi; que j'avais un cœur de chair et les autres un cœur de pierre. Il est sûr que j'éprouvais une facilité extrême à partager son extase; et que, dans les prières qu'elle faisait à haute voix, quelquefois il m'arrivait de prendre la parole, de suivre le fil de ses idées et de rencontrer, comme d'inspiration, une partie de ce qu'elle aurait dit elle-même. Les autres l'écoutaient en silence ou la suivaient, moi je l'interrompais, ou je la devançais, ou je parlais avec elle. Je conservais très-longtemps l'impression que j'avais prise; et il fallait apparemment que je lui en restituasse quelque chose; car si l'on discernait dans les autres qu'elles avaient conversé avec elle, on discernait en elle qu'elle avait conversé avec moi. Mais qu'est-ce que cela signifie, quand la vocation n'y est pas?... Notre station finie, nous cédâmes la place à celles qui nous succédaient; nous nous embrassâmes bien tendrement, ma jeune compagne et moi, avant que de nous séparer.","I felt a little relieved. My companion prayed upright; I prostrated myself; my forehead was leaning against the last step of the altar, and my arms were stretched out on the upper steps. I do not believe I have ever addressed myself to God with more consolation and fervor; my heart throbbed violently; I forgot in an instant everything around me. I don't know how long I remained in this position, nor how much longer I would have remained there; but I was a very touching spectacle, it must be believed, for my companion and for the two nuns who appeared. When I got up, I thought I was alone; I was wrong; they were all three placed behind me and bursting into tears: they had not dared to interrupt me; they were waiting for me to come out of myself from the state of transport and effusion in which they saw me. When I turned towards them, my face must have had a very imposing character, judging by the effect it produced on them and by what they added, that I then resembled our former superior, when she consoled us, and when the sight of me had caused them the same thrill. If I had had any penchant for hypocrisy or fanaticism, and had wanted to play a part in the house, I have no doubt that it would have succeeded. My soul is easily kindled, exalted, touched; and this good superior told me a hundred times while embracing me that no one would have loved God like me; that I had a heart of flesh and the others a heart of stone. It is certain that I experienced an extreme ease in sharing his ecstasy; and that, in the prayers she said aloud, sometimes I happened to speak, to follow the thread of her ideas and to encounter, as if inspired, part of what she would have said -same. The others listened to her in silence or followed her, I interrupted her, or I preceded her, or I talked with her. I preserved for a very long time the impression I had acquired; and apparently I had to restore something to him; for if one discerned in others that they had conversed with her, one discerned in her that she had conversed with me. But what does that mean, when the vocation is not there?... Our station ended, we gave way to those who succeeded us; we kissed very tenderly, my young companion and I, before we separated.","My soul was somewhat relieved. My companion prayed kneeling in an upright position, while I prostrated myself, my forehead pressed on the bottom step of the altar, my arms stretched out on the steps above. I do not think I have ever experienced such consolation and fervour when praying to God. My heart was pounding violently, and in an instant I was oblivious to everything around me. I do not know how long I remained in that position or how much longer I would have remained there, but I must have been a very touching spectacle for my companion and the two nuns who came to relieve us. When I finally got up, I thought I was alone, but I was wrong, for the three of them were standing behind me in tears. They had not dared interrupt me, preferring instead to wait for me to emerge of my own accord from this state of ecstasy and elation in which they found me. When I turned towards them, I must have looked very striking, to judge from the effect I had on them and from what they said. They said that I reminded them of our former Mother Superior when she used to console us, and that the sight of me had filled them with the same emotion. If I had had any inclination towards hypocrisy or fanaticism and had wanted to play a role in the convent, I am sure that I would have been successful. My soul catches fire easily, becomes exalted, and is moved, and that good Mother Superior told me a hundred times as she was embracing me that nobody would have loved God like me, that I had a heart of flesh whereas the others had hearts of stone. I certainly found it extremely easy to share her ecstasy, and when she prayed aloud, I sometimes started speaking too, following the train of her thoughts and encountering, as if inspired, something of what she might have said herself. The others listened to her in silence or followed her, whereas I interrupted her or anticipated what she was going to say or spoke at the same time as she did. The impression she had made on me remained with me for a very long time, and it seems that I must have given something of it back to her, for, just as one could see in others when they had spoken to her, so one could see in her when she had spoken to me. But what does any of that mean, if it has nothing to do with vocation? Our vigil ended, we made way for the nuns who had come to relieve us, and my young companion and I embraced very tenderly before going our separate ways.","My soul was in some measure comforted. My companion prayed kneeling, but I bowed myself down, my forehead touching the bottom step of the altar and my arm stretching up die other steps. I don’t think I have ever addressed God with more fervour and received more consolation; my heart palpitated violently and in a moment I lost all consciousness of anything round me. I don’t know how long I stayed in that position or how long I might have stayed, but apparently I was a very touching sight to my companion and to the two nuns when they came. When I rose I thought I was alone, but I was mistaken, for the three of them were behind me and weeping; they had not dared to interrupt me, but had waited for me to emerge from the state of elation and ecstasy in which they saw me. When I turned back towards them the expression on my face must have been awe-inspiring to judge from the effect produced upon them at the time and from what they said later, namely that I looked like our former Superior when she used to console us and that my appearance had filled them with the same awe. If I had had any hypocritical or fanatical tendencies and had wanted to become a figure in the convent I am sure I should have been successful. My soul easily catches fire, becomes exalted and is deeply moved, and that saintly Mother Superior told me a hundred times that nobody would have loved God like me, for I had a heart of flesh and the others hearts of stone. It is true that I found it extremely easy to share her ecstasy, and when she prayed aloud I sometimes took up what she had said, went on with the thread of her thoughts and found as if by inspiration part of what she would have said herself. The others listened in silence or followed on what she had said, but I interrupted or even anticipated her or spoke with her. The impress I- had taken from her remained stamped on me for a long time, and it seems that I must have given some of it back to her; for if it was clear in others that they had been conversing with her, it was also clear in her that she had been conversing with me. But what is the significance of all this if the vocation is not there? When our vigil was over we gave up our places to those who were to follow, and my young companion and I embraced very tenderly before separating."

"J'usai de sa permission; c'est, je crois, la seule bonne nuit que j'aie passée dans le cloître; et si, je n'en suis presque jamais sortie. Le lendemain, sur les neuf heures, j'entendis frapper doucement à ma porte; j'étais encore couchée; je répondis, on entra; c'était une religieuse qui me dit, d'assez mauvaise humeur, qu'il était tard, et que la mère supérieure me demandait. Je me levai, je m'habillai à la hâte, et j'allai.","I used his permission; it is, I believe, the only good night I have passed in the cloister; and yes, I almost never got out of it. The next day, at nine o'clock, I heard a soft knock at my door; I was still in bed; I answered, we entered; it was a nun who told me, in a rather bad mood, that it was late, and that the Mother Superior wanted me. I got up, dressed hastily, and went.","I took her at her word. That was, I think, the only good night’s sleep I ever had in a convent, although I spent most of my life in them. The next morning, at about nine o’clock, I heard someone tapping softly on my door. I was still in bed; I answered and someone came in; it was a nun who told me, rather testily, that it was late and that the Mother Superior wanted to see me. I got up, quickly got dressed, and went.","I liked. I availed myself of this and had what I think was the best night I ever spent in a convent, though I had hardly ever been anywhere else. Next morning at about nine I heard a gentle tap on my door. I was still in bed, I answered and somebody came in. It was a nun who told me rather snappily that it was late and Reverend Mother was asking for me. I got up, dressed hastily and went."

"Je m'arrangeai dans ma cellule; j'assistai à l'office du soir, au souper, à la récréation qui suivit. Quelques religieuses s'approchèrent de moi, d'autres s'en éloignèrent; celles-là comptaient sur ma protection auprès de la supérieure; celles-ci étaient déjà alarmées de la prédilection qu'elle m'avait accordée. Ces premiers moments se passèrent en éloges réciproques, en questions sur la maison que j'avais quittée, en essais de mon caractère, de mes inclinations, de mes goûts, de mon esprit: on vous tâte partout; c'est une suite de petites embûches qu'on vous tend, et d'où l'on tire les conséquences les plus justes. Par exemple, on jette un mot de médisance, et l'on vous regarde; on entame une histoire, et l'on attend que vous en demandiez la suite, ou que vous la laissiez; si vous dites un mot ordinaire, on le trouve charmant, quoiqu'on sache bien qu'il n'en est rien; on vous loue ou l'on vous blâme à dessein; on cherche à démêler vos pensées les plus secrètes; on vous interroge sur vos lectures; on vous offre des livres sacrés et profanes; on remarque votre choix; on vous invite à de légères infractions de la règle; on vous fait des confidences, on vous jette des mots sur les travers de la supérieure: tout se recueille et se redit; on vous quitte, on vous reprend; on sonde vos sentiments sur les mœurs, sur la piété, sur le monde, sur la religion, sur la vie monastique, sur tout. Il résulte de ces expériences réitérées une épithète qui vous caractérise, et qu'on attache en surnom à celui que vous portez; ainsi je fus appelée Sainte-Suzanne la réservée.","I arranged myself in my cell; I attended the evening service, the supper, and the recreation which followed. A few nuns approached me, others moved away; those counted on my protection with the superior; these were already alarmed at the predilection she had accorded me. These first moments passed in reciprocal eulogies, in questions about the house I had left, in tests of my character, my inclinations, my tastes, my mind: you are probed everywhere; it is a series of little ambushes that are set for you, and from which the fairest consequences are drawn. For example, one throws out a word of slander, and one looks at you; we begin a story, and we wait for you to ask for the continuation, or for you to leave it; if you say an ordinary word, we find it charming, although we know very well that it is not so; you are purposely praised or blamed; we seek to untangle your most secret thoughts; you are asked about your reading; you are offered sacred and profane books; your choice is noticed; you are invited to slight infractions of the rule; they confide in you, they throw words at you about the faults of the superior: everything is collected and repeated; they leave you, they take you back; We probe your feelings on morals, on piety, on the world, on religion, on monastic life, on everything. It results from these reiterated experiences an epithet which characterizes you, and which one attaches in nickname to that which you carry; so I was called Sainte-Suzanne the reserved one.","I settled myself into my cell. I went to the evening office, and then to supper and recreation afterwards. Some nuns came up to me, while others kept away. Those who came up were counting on my influence with the Mother Superior to protect them; those who kept away were already alarmed by the favour she had shown me. The first few minutes were devoted to our praising each other and to the nuns asking me about the convent I had left and trying to find out more about my character, my preferences, my tastes, and my mind; they paw you all over; they set you a whole series of little traps and draw from them the most accurate conclusions. For example, someone says something disparaging about someone else and then they look at you; someone starts telling a story and they wait for you either to ask what happened next or not to pick up on it. If you say something quite ordinary, they find it charming, although they all know it is nothing of the sort; they praise you or criticize you quite deliberately. They try to work out your innermost thoughts; they ask you about what you read, they offer you some sacred books and some secular ones, and they make a note of which one you choose. They encourage you to bend the rules; they tell you secrets; they say a few words here and there about the Mother Superior’s odd behaviour; everything is stored up and repeated. They drop you and then they become interested in you again; they sound you out about your feelings on morals, piety, the world, religion, monastic life, everything in fact. These repeated tests enable them to come up with an epithet which sums you up and which they tag on to your first name like a surname. So I was called Sainte Suzanne the shy.","I settled myself in to my cell, went to evening service and to supper and recreation afterwards. Some of the nuns made for me and other avoided me, the former counting on my influence with the Superior, the latter already disturbed by the favour she had shown me. These first moments were devoted to compliments on both sides, questions about the house I had left, soundings of my character, likes and dislikes, tastes and intelligence: you are felt all over, a little series of traps is set for you, from which they draw perfectly correct conclusions. For instance, somebody drops a word of gossip, and you are watched, somebody begins telling a story and they wait to see whether you ask for the rest or don’t take it up; if you make some commonplace remark it is called delightful, although they know quite well it is nothing of the kind; you are praised or criticized on purpose, they try to delve into your most secret thoughts; you are questioned about what you read, offered sacred and profane books and note is taken of what you choose; you are urged to commit slight infringements of the rules, you are told secrets, odd words are dropped about the curious behaviour of the Superior. And everything is stored up and repeated. You are dropped and taken up again, you are sounded for your opinions on morals, piety, the outside world, religion, the monastic life, everything. From these repeated experiments there results an epithet which characterizes you, and it is attached like a surname to the name you bear. I was called Sainte-Suzanne the Reserved."
"Je me conduisis avec discrétion; je crus pouvoir me répondre de moi. Je vis mon père; il me parla froidement; je vis ma mère; elle m'embrassa; je reçus des lettres de congratulation de mes sœurs et de beaucoup d'autres. Je sus que ce serait un M. Sornin, vicaire de Saint-Roch, qui ferait le sermon, et M. Thierry, chancelier de l'Université, qui recevrait mes vœux. Tout alla bien jusqu'à la veille du grand jour, excepté qu'ayant appris que la cérémonie serait clandestine, qu'il y aurait très-peu de monde, et que la porte de l'église ne serait ouverte qu'aux parents, j'appelai par la tourière toutes les personnes de notre voisinage, mes amis, mes amies; j'eus la permission d'écrire à quelques-unes de mes connaissances. Tout ce concours auquel on ne s'attendait guère se présenta; il fallut le laisser entrer; et l'assemblée fut telle à peu près qu'il la fallait pour mon projet. Oh, monsieur! quelle nuit que celle qui précéda8! Je ne me couchai point; j'étais assise sur mon lit; j'appelais Dieu à mon secours; j'élevais mes mains au ciel, je le prenais à témoin de la violence qu'on me faisait; je me représentais mon rôle au pied des autels, une jeune fille protestant à haute voix contre une action à laquelle elle paraît avoir consenti, le scandale des assistants, le désespoir des religieuses, la fureur de mes parents. «Ô Dieu! que vais-je devenir?...» En prononçant ces mots il me prit une défaillance générale, je tombai évanouie sur mon traversin; un frisson dans lequel mes genoux se battaient et mes dents se frappaient avec bruit, succéda à cette défaillance; à ce frisson une chaleur terrible: mon esprit se troubla. Je ne me souviens ni de m'être déshabillée, ni d'être sortie de ma cellule; cependant on me trouva nue en chemise, étendue par terre à la porte de la supérieure, sans mouvement et presque sans vie. J'ai appris ces choses depuis. Le matin je me trouvai dans ma cellule, mon lit environné de la supérieure, de la mère des novices, et de celles qu'on appelle les assistantes. J'étais fort abattue; on me fit quelques questions; on vit par mes réponses que je n'avais aucune connaissance de ce qui s'était passé; et l'on ne m'en parla pas. On me demanda comment je me portais, si je persistais dans ma sainte résolution, et si je me sentais en état de supporter la fatigue du jour. Je répondis que oui; et contre leur attente rien ne fut dérangé.","I behaved with discretion; I thought I could answer for myself. I saw my father; he spoke to me coldly; I saw my mother; she kissed me; I received congratulatory letters from my sisters and many others. I knew that it would be a M. Sornin, vicar of Saint-Roch, who would give the sermon, and M. Thierry, Chancellor of the University, who would receive my vows. All went well until the eve of the big day, except that having learned that the ceremony would be clandestine, that there would be very few people, and that the door of the church would be open only to parents, I called all the people in our neighborhood, my friends, my friends through the port; I had permission to write to some of my acquaintances. All this competition, which was hardly expected, presented itself; he had to be let in; and the assembly was nearly such as was necessary for my project. Ah, sir! what a night that preceded! I did not go to bed; I was sitting on my bed; I called on God to help me; I raised my hands to heaven, I took him to witness the violence that was done to me; I pictured to myself my role at the foot of the altars, a young girl protesting aloud against an action to which she seemed to have consented, the scandal of the assistants, the despair of the nuns, the fury of my parents. “O God! what will become of me?...” As I said these words, I fell into a faint, I fell fainting on my bolster; a shiver in which my knees beat and my teeth knocked noisily, succeeded this failure; at this shiver a terrible heat: my mind was troubled. I don't remember undressing or leaving my cell; however, I was found naked in my nightgown, lying on the ground at the superior's door, motionless and almost lifeless. I have since learned these things. In the morning I found myself in my cell, my bed surrounded by the superior, the mother of the novices, and those who are called the assistants. I was very dejected; I was asked a few questions; it was seen by my answers that I had no knowledge of what had happened; and no one spoke to me about it. They asked me how I was, if I persisted in my holy resolution, and if I felt able to bear the fatigue of the day. I answered yes; and contrary to their expectation nothing was disturbed.","I behaved discreetly; I thought I could take care of myself. I saw my father, who spoke to me coldly. I saw my mother, who kissed me. I received letters of congratulation from my sisters and from many others besides. I knew that a Monsieur Sornin, priest of Saint-Roch, would be giving the homily, and that Monsieur Thierry, chancellor of the University, would preside when I took my vows. * All went well until the day before the big day, except that, having discovered that the ceremony would take place behind closed doors, that there would be very few people in attendance, and that only family members would be allowed into the church, I had the doorkeeper * summon all the people in our neighbourhood, my friends, and I was allowed to write to some of my acquaintances. All these unexpected guests arrived at the church, and they had to be let in. So the congregation was of just about the necessary size for my plan to work. Oh, Monsieur! What a night I spent before the ceremony! I did not go to bed. Instead I sat and cried out to God to help me. I raised my hands heavenwards, and I called on him to witness the violence that was being done to me. I played out in my mind the role I would perform, kneeling before the altars, a young girl crying out in protest against an event to which she seems to have given her consent; I imagined the scandal that this would cause in those present, the despair that the nuns would feel, the anger of my parents. ‘ Oh God, what is to become of me?... ’ As I uttered these words, I became utterly weak and fainted, collapsing onto my bolster. This weakness was followed by trembling, my knees shook, and my teeth chattered loudly. After the trembling I felt feverish. My mind was unsettled. I cannot remember getting undressed or leaving my cell, but I was found, naked but for a chemise, lying on the ground outside the Mother Superior’s room, motionless and almost dead. I have found out these things since. In the morning I was in my cell, with the Mother Superior, the novice mistress, and those known as assistants all gathered around my bed. I was utterly exhausted. They asked me some questions, but they saw by my answers that I had no idea what had happened, so they did not tell me about it. They asked me how I was, if I still maintained my holy resolve, and if I felt up to the tiring events of the day. I said yes, and, contrary to their expectations, everything went ahead as planned.","I behaved with circumspection and felt I could look after myself. I saw my father who addressed me coolly, I saw my mother and she kissed me, I received letters of congratulation from my sisters and others. I learned that a Monsieur Sornin, parish priest of Saint-Roch, would preach the sermon and that a Monsieur Thierry, Chancellor of the University, would receive my vows. Everything went well until the eve of the great day, except that having heard that the ceremony was to be held in private, with very few people present, and that the doors of the church would be open only to relatives, I sent word by the gatekeeper to everybody in the neighbourhood, friends both male and female, and I got permission to write to some of my acquaintances. All this unexpected crowd of people appeared and had to be admitted, which produced the sort of assembly I wanted for my project. Oh Sir, what a night that preceding one was! I never got into the bed, but just sat on it. I called upon God to help me, I raised my hands to Heaven which I called upon to witness the violence being done to me. I visualized the part I was going to play before the altar, a girl protesting loudly against an act she seemed to have agreed to, the scandalized congregation, the despair of the nuns, the fury of my parents. ‘ Oh God, what is to become of me?’ As I said these words a faintness came over me and I fell lifeless on my pillow. This fainting fit was followed by a shivering in which my knees knocked together and my teeth chattered, and then came a terrible fever and my mind wandered. I have no recollection either of undressing or leaving my cell, and yet I was found lying outside the Superior’s door in nothing but my shift and almost lifeless. I learned these details later. In the morning I found myself back in my cell and round my bed were the Superior, the novice-mistress and what are called the assistants. I was well nigh prostrate; they asked me a few questions, but it was clear from my answers that I had no knowledge of what had happened, and they didn’t tell me. They asked how I felt, if I still stood by my pious resolve and whether I felt in a fit state to bear the fatigues of the day. I said I did, and contrary to their expectations nothing was altered."

Il est inutile que vous alliez à confesse, si vous n'avez que des bagatelles à lui dire.»","It was the eve of Pentecost. He was expected. I was worried, the superior noticed it, she told me about it. I did not hide the reason for my anxiety from him; she seemed to me even more alarmed than I was, although she did everything to hide it from me. She called Father Lemoine a ridiculous man, made fun of my scruples, asked me if Father Lemoine knew more about the innocence of his feelings and mine than our conscience, and if mine reproached me for something. I replied no. ""Well! she said to me, I am your superior, you owe me obedience, and I order you not to speak to her of this nonsense. It is useless for you to go to confession if you have nothing but trifles to tell him.","* It was the day before Pentecost and he was expected. I was troubled; the Mother Superior noticed this and talked to me about it. I did not hide from her the reason for my anxiety. She seemed more alarmed by this than I was, although she did her utmost to hide this from me. She called Father Lemoine a ridiculous man and made fun of my scruples. She asked me if Father Lemoine knew more than our own consciences about the innocence of her feelings and mine and if my conscience was reproaching me for something. I said no. ‘ Very well,’ she said, ‘I am your Mother Superior, you must obey me, and I order you to say none of these silly things to him. There’s no point in your going to confession if you’re only going to talk nonsense.’","It was the eve of Pentecost. He was expected. I was unsettled, the Superior noticed it and spoke to me about it. I did not conceal the reason for my anxiety, and she seemed more afraid than I was, although she did everything to hide it. She characterized Father Lemoine as a ridiculous person, laughed at my scruples, asked me whether Father Lemoine knew more about the innocence of her feelings and mine than our own consciences and if there was anything on mine. I said no. ‘ Very well, then,’ she said, ‘I am your Superior; you owe me obedience and I order you not to talk to him about such nonsense. It is pointless for you to go to confession if you only have silly little things like that to tell him.’"
"Quand cette conférence importune eut duré quelque temps, et que la première curiosité eut été satisfaite, la foule diminua; la supérieure écarta le reste, et elle vint elle-même m'installer dans ma cellule. Elle m'en fit les honneurs à sa mode; elle me montrait l'oratoire, et disait: «C'est là que ma petite amie priera Dieu; je veux qu'on lui mette un coussin sur ce marchepied, afin que ses petits genoux ne soient pas blessés. Il n'y a point d'eau bénite dans ce bénitier; cette sœur Dorothée oublie toujours quelque chose. Essayez ce fauteuil; voyez s'il vous sera commode...»","When this importunate conference had lasted some time, and the first curiosity had been satisfied, the crowd diminished; the superior dismissed the rest, and she herself came to install me in my cell.

There is no holy water in this stoup; this Sister Dorothée always forgets something. Try this armchair; see if it will be convenient for you...""","When this awkward conversation had gone on for some time and their initial curiosity had been satisfied, some of the crowd began to disperse, the Mother Superior sent the rest away, and she herself came and settled me in my new cell.

We need to put a cushion on this step so that she doesn’t hurt her little knees... There’s no holy water in this stoup: that Sister Dorothée is always forgetting things... Try this chair; see if you find it comfortable...’","When this tiresome cross-examination had gone on for some time and their first curiosity had been satisfied, the crowd thinned and the Superior edged the rest to one side and herself came to see me installed in my cell.

"Le lendemain, après l'office, je fus encore recommandée aux prières publiques de la communauté: l'on pria en silence, et l'on dit à voix basse la même hymne que la veille. Même cérémonie le troisième jour, avec cette différence que l'on m'ordonna de me placer debout au milieu du chœur, et que l'on récita les prières pour les agonisants, les litanies des Saints, avec le refrain ora pro eâ. Le quatrième jour, ce fut une momerie qui marquait bien le caractère bizarre de la supérieure. À la fin de l'office, on me fit coucher dans une bière au milieu du chœur; on plaça des chandeliers à mes côtés, avec un bénitier; on me couvrit d'un suaire, et l'on récita l'office des morts, après lequel chaque religieuse, en sortant, me jeta de l'eau bénite, en disant: Requiescat in pace. Il faut entendre la langue des couvents, pour connaître l'espèce de menace contenue dans ces derniers mots. Deux religieuses relevèrent le suaire, éteignirent les cierges, et me laissèrent là, trempée jusqu'à la peau, de l'eau dont elles m'avaient malicieusement arrosée. Mes habits se séchèrent sur moi; je n'avais pas de quoi me rechanger. Cette mortification fut suivie d'une autre. La communauté s'assembla; on me regarda comme une réprouvée, ma démarche fut traitée d'apostasie; et l'on défendit, sous peine de désobéissance, à toutes les religieuses de me parler, de me secourir, de m'approcher, et de toucher même aux choses qui m'auraient servi. Ces ordres furent exécutés à la rigueur. Nos corridors sont étroits; deux personnes ont, en quelques endroits, de la peine à passer de front: si j'allais, et qu'une religieuse vînt à moi, ou elle retournait sur ses pas, ou elle se collait contre le mur, tenant son voile et son vêtement, de crainte qu'il ne frottât contre le mien. Si l'on avait quelque chose à recevoir de moi, je le posais à terre, et on le prenait avec un linge; si l'on avait quelque chose à me donner, oh me le jetait. Si l'on avait eu le malheur de me toucher, l'on se croyait souillée, et l'on allait s'en confesser et s'en faire absoudre chez la supérieure. On a dit que la flatterie était vile et basse; elle est encore bien cruelle et bien ingénieuse, lorsqu'elle se propose de plaire par les mortifications qu'elle invente. Combien de fois je me suis rappelé le mot de ma céleste supérieure de Moni: «Entre toutes ces créatures que vous voyez autour de moi, si dociles, si innocentes, si douces, eh bien! mon enfant, il n'y en a presque pas une, non, presque pas une, dont je ne pusse faire une bête féroce; étrange métamorphose pour laquelle la disposition est d'autant plus grande, qu'on est entré plus jeune dans une cellule, et que l'on connaît moins la vie sociale: ce discours vous étonne; Dieu vous préserve d'en éprouver la vérité. Sœur Suzanne, la bonne religieuse est celle qui apporte dans le cloître quelque grande faute à expier.»","The next day, after the service, I was again recommended to the public prayers of the community: they prayed in silence, and they said in a low voice the same hymn as the day before. Same ceremony on the third day, with this difference that I was ordered to stand in the middle of the choir, and that they recited the prayers for the dying, the litanies of the Saints, with the refrain ora pro eâ. On the fourth day, it was a mummery which clearly marked the bizarre character of the superior. At the end of the office, I was made to sleep in a coffin in the middle of the choir; candlesticks were placed by my side, with a stoup; I was covered with a shroud, and the Office of the Dead was recited, after which each nun, on leaving, sprinkled me with holy water, saying: Requiescat in pace. You have to hear the language of the convents to know the kind of threat contained in these last words. Two nuns lifted the shroud, extinguished the candles, and left me there, soaked to the skin with the water they had mischievously sprinkled on me. My clothes dried on me; I had nothing to replace myself with. This mortification was followed by another. The community assembled; I was looked upon as a reprobate, my step was treated as apostasy; and all the nuns were forbidden, under pain of disobedience, to speak to me, to help me, to approach me, and even to touch anything that might have served me. These orders were strictly executed. Our corridors are narrow; two people have, in some places, difficulty in passing abreast: if I was going, and a nun came to me, either she retraced her steps, or she pressed herself against the wall, holding her veil and her garment, lest it rub against mine. If they had something to receive from me, I put it on the ground, and they took it with a cloth; if someone had something to give me, oh threw it at me. If someone had had the misfortune to touch me, they thought they were soiled, and they went to confess and be absolved by the superior. Flattery has been said to be vile and base; she is still very cruel and very ingenious when she sets out to please by the mortifications she invents. How many times have I remembered the words of my celestial superior of Moni: “Among all these creatures that you see around me, so docile, so innocent, so sweet, well! my child, there is hardly one, no, hardly one, of which I could not make a ferocious beast; strange metamorphosis for which the disposition is all the greater, the younger one entered a cell, and the less one knows about social life: this discourse astonishes you; God preserve you from testing the truth of it. Sister Suzanne, the good nun is the one who brings into the cloister some great fault to expiate.”","The next day, after the office, I was again commended to the public prayers of the community. They prayed in silence and the same hymn as the previous day was recited softly. The same ceremony took place on the third day, but with one difference: I was told to stand in the middle of the choir and they recited the prayers for the dying and the litanies of the saints with the refrain Ora pro ea. * On the fourth day there was a ploy which revealed the Mother Superior’s peculiar character. At the end of the office I was made to lie down in a coffin in the middle of the choir, with candlesticks and a stoup of holy water placed beside me. I was covered with a shroud and they recited the office for the dead, after which each nun, as she left, sprinkled me with holy water and said Requiescat in pace. * You have to understand the language of convents in order to understand the particular kind of threat that was implicit in those words. Two nuns removed the shroud, blew out the candles and left me there soaked to the skin with the water that they had maliciously thrown on me. My clothes dried on me as I had nothing to change into. This mortification was followed by another. The community gathered. They considered me a reprobate, my behaviour was presented as apostasy, and it was forbidden as an act of disobedience for any nun to speak to me, to help me, to come near me, or even to touch anything I had used. These orders were carried out to the letter. Our corridors are narrow and in some places it is difficult for two people to walk side by side. If I was walking along and a nun was coming towards me, either she would turn round and go back or she would press herself against the wall, clutching her veil and habit for fear of their brushing against mine. If anything had to be taken from me, I had first to put it on the ground and then it would be picked up with a cloth. If anything had to be given to me, it was thrown. If anyone had the misfortune to touch me, they thought themselves sullied and they would go and make their confession and receive absolution from the Mother Superior. It has been said that flattery is vile and base, but more than that, it is cruel and ingenious when it sets out to please someone by inventing mortifications. How many times have I recalled the words of my saintly Mother de Moni: ‘Out of all these creatures you see around me, so docile, so innocent, and so gentle, well, my child, there is scarcely one, scarcely a single one that I could not turn into a wild animal; a strange metamorphosis to which one is all the more susceptible the younger one enters religion and the less one knows of life in society. These words surprise you: may God preserve you from ever finding out how true they are. Sister Suzanne, the good nun is the one who brings with her into the cloister some great sin to expiate.’","The following day after service I was again commended to the public prayers of the community. They prayed in silence and recited in a low voice the same hymn as the day before. The same on the third day, with this difference that I was ordered to stand in the middle of the choir and they recited the prayers for the dying, the litanies of the saints with the refrain ora pro ea. On the fourth day there was a pantomime typical of the weird mentality of the Superior. At the end of the service I was made to lie in a coffin in the centre of the choir, candles were placed on either side with a holy-water stoup, I was covered with a shroud and the prayers for the dead were recited, after which each nun, as she went out, sprinkled me with holy water and said Requiescat in pace. You have to be familiar with the language of convents in order to appreciate the particular threat implied in those last two words.∗ The nuns lifted the shroud, put out the candles and left me there, soaked to the skin with the water they had deliberately sprinkled over me. My clothes dried on me, for I had nothing to change into. This mortification was followed by another. A general assembly was held, I was treated as a delinquent, my action was designated as apostasy, and it was forbidden as an act of disobedience for any nun to speak to me, help me, come near me or even touch any object I had used. These orders were strictly adhered to. Our corridors are narrow, and in some places it is difficult for two people to pass each other without turning sideways; if therefore I was going along and a nun came towards me, either she went back again or stood flat against the wall, clutching her veil and habit for fear of their touching mine. If anything had to be taken from me, I put it on the ground and they would pick it up with a cloth; if anything had to be given to me, they would throw it If somebody had been unfortunate enough to touch me, she considered herself unclean and went to confess and obtain absolution from the Superior. Flattery has been called vile and mean; it is cruel and ingenious as well when it sets itself out to please somebody by inventing mortifications. How many times have I recalled the words of my saintly Mother de Moni: ‘Among all these creatures you see round me, so docile, so innocent, so gentle, indeed, my child, there is scarcely one, yes, scarcely one, I could not turn into a wild beast, and the likelihood of this strange metamorphosis happening is the more marked the younger they go into a cell and the less they know of social life. This strikes you as a strange thing to say, and God save you from ever experiencing the truth of it. Sister Suzanne, the good nun is the one who brings with her into the cloister some grievous sin to expiate.’"

"On avait tout disposé dès la veille. On sonna les cloches pour apprendre à tout le monde qu'on allait faire une malheureuse. Le cœur me battit encore. On vint me parer; ce jour est un jour de toilette; à présent que je me rappelle toutes ces cérémonies, il me semble qu'elles avaient quelque chose de solennel et de bien touchant9 pour une jeune innocente que son penchant n'entraînerait point ailleurs. On me conduisit à l'église; on célébra la sainte messe: le bon vicaire, qui me soupçonnait une résignation que je n'avais point, me fit un long sermon où il n'y avait pas un mot qui ne fût à contre-sens; c'était quelque chose de bien ridicule que tout ce qu'il me disait de mon bonheur, de la grâce, de mon courage, de mon zèle, de ma ferveur et de tous les beaux sentiments qu'il me supposait. Ce contraste et de son éloge et de la démarche que j'allais faire me troubla; j'eus des moments d'incertitude, mais qui durèrent peu. Je n'en sentis que mieux que je manquais de tout ce qu'il fallait avoir pour être une bonne religieuse. Enfin le moment terrible arriva. Lorsqu'il fallut entrer dans le lieu où je devais prononcer le vœu de mon engagement, je ne me trouvai plus de jambes; deux de mes compagnes me prirent sous les bras; j'avais la tête renversée sur une d'elles, et je me traînais. Je ne sais ce qui se passait dans l'âme des assistants, mais ils voyaient une jeune victime mourante qu'on portait à l'autel, et il s'échappait de toutes parts des soupirs et des sanglots, au milieu desquels je suis bien sûre que ceux de mon père et de ma mère ne se firent point entendre. Tout le monde était debout; il y avait de jeunes personnes montées sur des chaises, et attachées aux barreaux de la grille; et il se faisait un profond silence, lorsque celui qui présidait à ma profession me dit: «Marie-Suzanne Simonin, promettez-vous de dire la vérité?","We had everything ready the night before. We rang the bells to tell everyone that we were going to make someone unhappy. My heart pounded again. They came to adorn me; this day is a toilet day; now that I remember all these ceremonies, it seems to me that there was something solemn and very touching about them9 for a young innocent whose inclination would not lead her elsewhere. They took me to the church; Holy Mass was celebrated: the good vicar, who suspected me of a resignation that I did not have, gave me a long sermon in which there was not a word that was not nonsense; it was something very ridiculous, all that he told me of my happiness, of my grace, of my courage, of my zeal, of my fervor, and of all the beautiful feelings he supposed me to have. This contrast between his praise and the step I was about to take troubled me; I had moments of uncertainty, but they didn't last long. I felt all the better that I lacked everything one needed to be a good nun. Finally the terrible moment arrived. When I had to enter the place where I was to pronounce the vow of my commitment, I no longer found my legs; two of my companions took me under the arms; I had my head thrown back on one of them, and I was dragging myself. I don't know what was going on in the souls of those present, but they saw a young dying victim being carried to the altar, and sighs and sobs escaped from all sides, in the midst of which I am well sure that those of my father and my mother were not heard. Everyone was standing; there were young people mounted on chairs and tied to the bars of the gate; and there was a profound silence when the person who presided over my profession said to me: “Marie-Suzanne Simonin, do you promise to tell the truth?","Everything had been arranged the day before. The bells were rung to announce to everyone that a young girl was to be made to suffer. My heart was still pounding. Nuns came to get me ready: this day is a day for getting dressed up. As I recall these rituals now, it seems to me that they had about them something solemn and rather touching for an innocent young girl whose inclination led her nowhere else. I was taken to the church; mass was celebrated. The good priest, who discerned in me a resignation that I did not have, gave me a long sermon in which every single word was misconceived. Everything he said to me about my happiness, about grace, about my courage, my zeal, my fervour, and all the fine feelings he imagined me to have, was simply ridiculous. This contrast between his praise of me and what I was about to do troubled me; I had moments of uncertainty, but they soon passed. I felt now more than ever that I lacked everything that was required in order to be a good nun. Meanwhile the fateful moment arrived. When I had to enter the place where I was to make my vows, I found I could no longer walk. Two of my companions took me by the arms. I rested my head on the shoulder of one of them, and I dragged myself along. I do not know what was happening in the souls of those present, but they saw before them a young victim, close to death, being taken to the altar, and all around me I could hear sighs and tears, though not , I am sure, from my father and mother. Everyone was on their feet; some young women had climbed up on chairs and pressed themselves against the grille. * Everyone fell completely silent when the person presiding at the ceremony said to me: ‘Marie-Suzanne Simonin, do you promise to tell the truth?’","Everything had been made ready the day before. The bells were rung to inform the world that a woman was about to be condemned to misery. Once again my heart beat suffocatingly. They came to adorn me, as this day is a full-dress occasion. Now that I recall all these ceremonies I think there was something very solemn and touching about them for an innocent young girl not drawn in other directions. I was led to the chapel, Mass was celebrated and the good priest, who credited me with a resignation I certainly did not possess, preached a long sermon in which every single word was the opposite of the truth. It was really ridiculous, all he said about my happiness, the grace I had been vouchsafed, my courage, my zeal, my fervour and all the other fine sentiments he imagined I had. The contrast between his eulogy and the public demonstration I was about to make disconcerted me, I had moments of misgiving, but not for long, for it made me realize all the more that I lacked the qualities required to make a good nun. At last the terrible moment came. When I was to advance to the place where I had to pronounce my final vows my legs refused to carry me; two of my companions supported me under the arms, on one of which lay my head, and my feet dragged along. I don’t know what was going on in the minds of the people present, but they were watching a dying victim being dragged to the altar, and on all sides could be heard sighs and sobs, though I am quite sure that those of my father and mother were not to be heard among them. Everybody was standing, and some young people were standing on chairs or clinging to the bars of the grille. A heavy silence fell when the man presiding over my profession said: ‘Marie-Suzanne Simonin, do you promise to speak the truth?’"
"J'allais entrer dans la comparaison de mes sœurs et de moi, lorsqu'il m'arrêta et me dit:","I was about to enter into the comparison of my sisters and myself, when he stopped me and said to me:","I was about to compare myself to my sisters, but he stopped me and said:","I was about to embark upon a comparison between my sisters and myself, but he stopped me and said:"
"Je ne finirais point, si je voulais suivre ce détail de persécutions. Ah! monsieur, si vous avez des enfants, apprenez par mon sort celui que vous leur préparez, si vous souffrez qu'ils entrent en religion sans les marques de la vocation la plus forte et la plus décidée. Qu'on est injuste dans le monde! On permet à un enfant de disposer de sa liberté à un âge où il ne lui est pas permis de disposer d'un écu. Tuez plutôt votre fille que de l'emprisonner dans un cloître malgré elle; oui, tuez-la. Combien j'ai désiré de fois d'avoir été étouffée par ma mère en naissant! elle eût été moins cruelle. Croiriez-vous bien qu'on m'ôta mon bréviaire, et qu'on me défendit de prier Dieu? Vous pensez bien que je n'obéis pas. Hélas! c'était mon unique consolation; j'élevais mes mains vers le ciel, je poussais des cris, et j'osais espérer qu'ils étaient entendus du seul être qui voyait toute ma misère. On écoutait à ma porte; et un jour que je m'adressais à lui dans l'accablement de mon cœur, et que je l'appelais à mon aide, on me dit:","I would not finish if I wanted to follow this detail of persecutions. Ah! sir, if you have children, learn by my lot what you are preparing for them, if you allow them to enter religion without the marks of the strongest and most decided vocation. How unjust the world is! A child is allowed to dispose of his freedom at an age when he is not allowed to dispose of a crown. Rather kill your daughter than imprison her in a cloister in spite of herself; yes, kill her. How many times I wished to have been suffocated by my mother when I was born! she would have been less cruel. Would you believe that my breviary was taken away from me, and that I was forbidden to pray to God? You can well imagine that I do not obey. Alas! it was my only consolation; I raised my hands to the sky, I uttered cries, and I dared to hope that they were heard by the only being who saw all my misery. They listened at my door; and one day when I addressed myself to him in the overwhelm of my heart, and called him to my aid, I was told:","I could go on for ever describing in detail how I was persecuted. Oh Monsieur, if you have any children, let my fate be a warning to you about the fate you would be preparing for them if you allowed them to enter the religious life without showing signs of the strongest and most committed vocation. How unjust people are to allow a child to take responsibility for her own freedom at an age when she is not even allowed to spend an écu. * Kill your daughter rather than imprison her against her will in a convent, yes, kill her. How often have I wished that my mother had smothered me at birth! It would have been less cruel of her. Would you believe that they took away my breviary and forbade me to pray to God? As you may well expect, I disobeyed them. Alas, that was my only consolation. I lifted up my hands to God, I cried out loud, and I was bold enough to hope that my cries were heard by the only Being who saw all my suffering. They listened at my door, and one day, as I was praying to him, my heart utterly downcast, and calling upon him to help me, one of them said to me:","If I insisted on going into all the details about my persecutions I should never end. Oh Sir, if you have any children let my fate be a warning of the sort of fate you prepare for them if you let them go into the religious life without showing the strongest and most unmistakable signs of a vocation. What injustice there is in a world which allows a child to dispose of his own liberty at an age when he is not allowed to touch a penny. Kill your own daughter rather than imprison her in a cloister against her will – yes, kill her! How often have I wished that my mother had strangled me at birth! It would have been less cruel of her. Would you believe that they took away my breviary and forbade me to pray to God? I did not obey, as you can well imagine. Alas, it was my sole consolation; I lifted my arms to heaven and cried aloud, daring to hope that my cries were heard by the only Being who saw all my distress. They listened outside my door, and one day when I was calling upon Him out of the depth of my woe and imploring His help they said:"

"À ces mots, je crus qu'elles avaient tenu conseil, et qu'elles avaient résolu de se défaire de moi. J'avais bien entendu dire que cela se pratiquait quelquefois dans les couvents de certains religieux, qu'ils jugeaient, qu'ils condamnaient et qu'ils suppliciaient. Je ne croyais pas qu'on eût jamais exercé cette inhumaine juridiction dans aucun couvent de femmes; mais il y avait tant d'autres choses que je n'avais pas devinées et qui s'y passaient! À cette idée de mort prochaine, je voulus crier; mais ma bouche était ouverte, et il n'en sortait aucun son; j'avançais vers la supérieure des bras suppliants et mon corps défaillant se renversait en arrière; je tombai, mais ma chute ne fut pas dure. Dans ces moments de transe où la force abandonne, insensiblement les membres se dérobent, s'affaissent, pour ainsi dire, les uns sur les autres; et la nature, ne pouvant se soutenir, semble chercher à défaillir mollement. Je perdis la connaissance et le sentiment; j'entendis seulement bourdonner autour de moi des voix confuses et lointaines; soit qu'elles parlassent, soit que les oreilles me tintassent, je ne distinguais rien que ce tintement qui durait. Je ne sais combien je restai dans cet état, mais j'en fus tirée par une fraîcheur subite qui me causa une convulsion légère, et qui m'arracha un profond soupir. J'étais traversée d'eau; elle coulait de mes vêtements à terre; c'était celle d'un grand bénitier qu'on m'avait répandue sur le corps. J'étais couchée sur le côté, étendue dans cette eau, la tête appuyée contre le mur, la bouche entr'ouverte et les yeux à demi morts et fermés; je cherchai à les ouvrir et à regarder; mais il me sembla que j'étais enveloppée d'un air épais, à travers lequel je n'entrevoyais que des vêtements flottants, auxquels je cherchais à m'attacher sans le pouvoir. Je faisais effort du bras sur lequel je n'étais pas soutenue; je voulais le lever, mais je le trouvais trop pesant; mon extrême faiblesse diminua peu à peu; je me soulevai; je m'appuyais le dos contre le mur; j'avais les deux mains dans l'eau, la tête penchée sur la poitrine; et je poussais une plainte inarticulée, entrecoupée et pénible. Ces femmes me regardaient d'un air qui marquait la nécessité, l'inflexibilité et qui m'ôtait le courage de les implorer. La supérieure dit:","At these words, I believed that they had held a council, and that they had resolved to get rid of me. I had of course heard that this was sometimes practiced in the convents of certain monks, that they judged, that they condemned and that they tortured. I did not believe that this inhuman jurisdiction had ever been exercised in any women's convent; but there were so many other things that I hadn't guessed that were happening there! At this idea of approaching death, I wanted to cry out; but my mouth was open, and no sound came out; I advanced towards the superior of the supplicating arms and my failing body fell backwards; I fell, but my fall was not hard. In those moments of trance when strength gives up, imperceptibly the limbs give way, collapse, so to speak, on top of each other; and nature, unable to sustain itself, seems to seek to weaken softly. I lost consciousness and feeling; I only heard confused and distant voices buzzing around me; whether they were talking or whether my ears were ringing, I could only distinguish this ringing which lasted. I don't know how long I remained in this state, but I was pulled out of it by a sudden coolness which caused me a slight convulsion, and which wrung a deep sigh from me. I was crossed by water; it flowed from my clothes on the ground; it was that of a large holy water font that had been spread over my body. I was lying on my side, stretched out in this water, my head leaning against the wall, my mouth half open and my eyes half dead and closed; I tried to open them and look; but it seemed to me that I was enveloped in a thick air, through which I only caught a glimpse of loose clothes, to which I was trying to attach myself without the power. I made an effort with the arm on which I was not supported; I wanted to lift it, but I found it too heavy; my extreme weakness diminished little by little; I got up; I was leaning my back against the wall; I had both hands in the water, my head bent over my chest; and I uttered an inarticulate, broken and painful complaint. These women looked at me with an air that marked necessity, inflexibility and that took away my courage to implore them. The superior says:","Hearing this, I thought that they had deliberated and had decided to get rid of me. I had certainly heard that this sort of thing sometimes happened in certain monasteries, where a monk would be judged, condemned, and tortured to death. I did not think that this inhuman form of trial had ever been practised in a convent. But then there were so many other things that went on that I had not imagined possible! Believing my death to be imminent, I wanted to scream, but I opened my mouth and no sound came out. I went towards the Mother Superior, holding my arms out in supplication, and my feeble body fell backwards. I collapsed on the ground, but did not land heavily. In such moments of stupor when all one’s strength imperceptibly drains away, one’s limbs give way and collapse, so to speak, on top of each other, and since nature cannot sustain herself, she seems to try to weaken gently. I lost all consciousness and feeling. All I could hear was confused and distant voices buzzing around me. Whether it was the nuns talking or my ears ringing, all I could make out was that constant buzzing. I do not know how long I remained in this condition, but I was brought round by a sudden chill which made me jump slightly and take a deep breath. I was soaked in water, which dripped from my clothes onto the floor, water that had been thrown over me from a large stoup. I was lying on my side in this puddle of water, with my head against the wall, my mouth half open, and my eyes lifeless and half closed. I tried to open them and look around, but it was as if I was surrounded by a thick haze through which all I could see was flapping habits, which I tried to focus on in vain. I attempted to move my arm that was not supporting me and tried to raise it, but it was too heavy for me. My extreme weakness gradually retreated, and I lifted myself up and sat with my back against the wall, my hands in the puddle of water and my head resting on my chest, and I gave an inarticulate, broken, painful groan. The way the women looked at me betrayed their determination and their intransigence, and it robbed me of the courage to appeal to them for mercy. The Mother Superior said:","These words led me to believe that they had taken counsel together and resolved to get rid of me. I had heard that that did sometimes occur in certain religious establishments – they judged, condemned and executed. I did not think that this inhuman method of trial had ever been used in a women’s convent, but there were so many things I had never guessed and which did happen! This thought of imminent death made me want to cry out, but though my mouth was open no sound came. I moved towards the Superior with my arms held out in supplication and my body leaning backwards, swooning. I fell, but it was not a heavy fall. In such fainting fits when one’s strength abandons one, the limbs seem to give way and as it were fold up unawares; nature, unable to hold up, seems to try to collapse gently. I lost consciousness and the sense of feeling, and merely heard confused and distant voices buzzing round me; whether it was real speech or a singing in my ears, I could make out nothing but this continual buzzing. I don’t know how long I stayed in this condition, but I was dragged out of it by a sudden coldness which made my body jerk slightly and drew from me a deep sigh. I was soaked with water which had been poured over my body from a big holy water stoup. I was lying on my side in this puddle of water, with my head against the wall, mouth half-open and eyes glazed and half closed. I tried to open them and look about me, but it seemed as though I was surrounded by a thick haze through which I could only glimpse moving bits of garments, which I tried in vain to look at properly. I made an effort with the arm which was not supporting me, wanted to raise it, but it was too heavy. Yet my extreme weakness did gradually diminish, and I raised myself, supported my back against the wall with my two hands in the water and my head drooping on my chest, uttering occasional inarticulate and painful moans. These women stared at me with an expression suggesting that they were under compulsion, hence immovable, which deprived me of the courage to try to sof ten them. The Superior said:"
"—N'y manquez pas, car j'ai quelque chose d'important à vous communiquer.","“Don't miss it, because I have something important to communicate to you.","‘Make sure you do, because I’ve got something important to tell you.’","‘Don’t forget, for I’ve something important to discuss with you.’"
"Je lui dis: «Ma chère mère, qu'est-ce qui m'est arrivé? Est-ce qu'il me serait échappé quelque chose qui vous aurait offensée? Pardonnez-moi.

I use the freedom you have granted me; I study nothing of what I have to tell you; and then, when I studied myself, I wouldn't say otherwise, perhaps worse. The things we talk about are so foreign to me! Excuse me...""","I said to her: ‘My dear Mother, what have I done? Have I happened to say something which has upset you? Forgive me. I’m taking advantage of the freedom you’ve given me. Nothing I say to you is studied, and even if I were more studied, I wouldn’t say anything differently; perhaps I’d even speak less well. I find the things we’re talking about so strange! Forgive me...’","I said: ‘Dear Mother, what have I done? Has something escaped me which has upset you? Forgive me. I am using the freedom you have given me, and nothing I have to say to you is in any way studied, and besides, if I were to think it out I wouldn’t put it any differently and might not do it as well.

"—Rassurez-vous, mon enfant; je te réponds qu'elle a plus de frayeur de toi que tu n'en dois avoir d'elle.»","“Reassure yourself, my child; I answer you that she is more afraid of you than you ought to be of her.","‘Don’t worry, my child.

"—Adieu, je m'en vais. On va venir vous habiller; je n'y veux pas être, cela me distrairait.

"J'arrive à Paris. La voiture arrête dans une petite rue, à une porte étroite qui s'ouvrait dans une allée obscure et malpropre. La maîtresse du logis vient au-devant de moi, et m'installe à l'étage le plus élevé, dans une petite chambre où je trouve à peu près les meubles nécessaires. Je reçois des visites de la femme qui occupait le premier. «Vous êtes jeune, vous devez vous ennuyer, mademoiselle. Descendez chez moi, vous y trouverez bonne compagnie en hommes et en femmes, pas toutes aussi aimables, mais presque aussi jeunes que vous. On cause, on joue, on chante, on danse; nous réunissons toutes les sortes d'amusements. Si vous tournez la tête à tous nos cavaliers, je vous jure que nos dames n'en seront ni jalouses ni fâchées. Venez, mademoiselle...» Celle qui me parlait ainsi était d'un certain âge, elle avait le regard tendre, la voix douce, et le propos très-insinuant.","I arrive at Paris. The car stops in a small street, at a narrow door which opened into a dark and dirty alley.

Come down to my house, you will find good company there in men and women, not all so amiable, but almost as young as you. We talk, we play, we sing, we dance; we bring together all kinds of amusements. If you turn the heads of all our cavaliers, I swear to you that our ladies will be neither jealous nor angry. Come, mademoiselle...' The one who spoke to me thus was of a certain age, she had a tender look, a soft voice, and a very insinuating remark.","I arrive in Paris.

"Comme nous étions venues au monde à peu de distance les unes des autres, nous devînmes grandes tous les trois ensemble. Il se présenta des partis. Ma sœur aînée fut recherchée par un jeune homme charmant; bientôt je m'aperçus qu'il me distinguait, et je devinai qu'elle ne serait incessamment que le prétexte de ses assiduités. Je pressentis tout ce que cette préférence pouvait m'attirer de chagrins; et j'en avertis ma mère. C'est peut-être la seule chose que j'aie faite en ma vie qui lui ait été agréable, et voici comment j'en fus récompensée. Quatre jours après, ou du moins à peu de jours, on me dit qu'on avait arrêté ma place dans un couvent; et dès le lendemain j'y fus conduite. J'étais si mal à la maison, que cet événement ne m'affligea point; et j'allai à Sainte-Marie, c'est mon premier couvent, avec beaucoup de gaieté. Cependant l'amant de ma sœur ne me voyant plus, m'oublia, et devint son époux. Il s'appelle M. K***; il est notaire, et demeure à Corbeil, où il fait le plus mauvais ménage. Ma seconde sœur fut mariée à un M. Bauchon, marchand de soieries à Paris, rue Quincampoix, et vit assez bien avec lui.","As we had come into the world not far from each other, the three of us grew up together. Parties presented themselves. My eldest sister was sought out by a charming young man; soon I perceived that he singled me out, and I guessed that she would incessantly be only the pretext for his assiduous attentions. I had a presentiment of how much grief this preference could bring on me; and I tell my mother. It was perhaps the only thing I did in my life that pleased him, and this is how I was rewarded for it. Four days later, or at least a few days later, I was told that they had fixed my place in a convent; and the next day I was taken there. I was so ill at home that this event did not distress me at all; and I went to Sainte-Marie, it was my first convent, with great gaiety. However, my sister's lover, no longer seeing me, forgot me and became her husband. His name is Mr. K***; he is a notary, and lives at Corbeil, where he makes the worst household. My second sister was married to a M. Bauchon, silk merchant in Paris, rue Quincampoix, and lives quite well with him.","Since the three of us had been born in quick succession, we grew up together. Eligible young men made themselves known to us. My eldest sister was courted by a charming young man. I soon noticed that he was more interested in me, however, and I guessed that she would quickly become just the pretext for his frequent visits. Even then I could see all the pain that his attentions might cause me, so I warned my mother. This was perhaps the only thing I ever did in my whole life that pleased her, and this is how I was rewarded. Four days later, or thereabouts, I was told that a place had been found for me in a convent, and the following day I was taken there. I was so unhappy at home that this turn of events did not trouble me at all, and I went off to Sainte-Marie,* my first convent, quite cheerfully. My sister’s suitor, meanwhile, not seeing me any more, forgot all about me and duly married her. His name is Monsieur K..., and he is a notary in Corbeil, where married life is treating him rather badly. My second sister was married to a Monsieur Bauchon, a silk merchant in Paris, in the rue Quincampoix, and they are happy together.","As all three of us were very close to each other in age we all grew up together.

I foresaw all the trouble this preference might bring upon me, and I warned my mother. That was perhaps the only thing I have done in my whole life that pleased her, and this is how I was rewarded. Four days, or anyway only a few days later, I was told that a place had been arranged for me in a convent, and the very next day I was taken there. Life at home was so miserable that this did not upset me, and I went off to Sainte-Marie, my first convent, in high spirits. As for my sister’s young man, I was out of sight and out of mind, and he duly married her. His name is Monsieur K. , he is a lawyer living in Corbeil, and his home life is very unhappy indeed. My second sister was married to a Monsieur Bauchon, a Paris silk merchant in the rue Quincampoix, and they get on fairly well together."

"J'étais enchantée d'avoir ce petit service à lui rendre. Je rentrai. Une autre avait pris ma place en mon absence sur le bord du lit de la supérieure, était penchée vers elle, le coude appuyé entre ses deux cuisses, et lui montrait son ouvrage; la supérieure, les yeux presque fermés, lui disait oui et non, sans presque la regarder; et j'étais debout à côté d'elle sans qu'elle s'en aperçût. Cependant elle ne tarda pas à revenir de sa légère distraction. Celle qui s'était emparée de ma place, me la rendit; je me rassis; ensuite me penchant doucement vers la supérieure, qui s'était un peu relevée sur ses oreillers, je me tus, mais je la regardai comme si j'avais une grâce à lui demander. «Eh bien, me dit-elle, qu'est-ce qu'il y a? parlez, que voulez-vous? est-ce qu'il est en moi de vous refuser quelque chose?","I was delighted to have this little service to render him. I returned. Another had taken my place in my absence on the edge of the Superior's bed, was leaning towards her, leaning her elbow between her two thighs, and showing her her work; the superior, her eyes almost closed, said yes and no, almost without looking at her; and I was standing next to her without her noticing. However, she soon recovered from her slight distraction. The one who had taken my place gave it back to me; I sat down again; then leaning gently towards the superior, who had risen a little on her pillows, I was silent, but I looked at her as if I had a favor to ask of her. “Well, she said to me, what is it? speak, what do you want? is it in me to refuse you something?","I was delighted to be able to do her this little favour. I went back in. While I had been out of the room, another nun had taken my place on the edge of the Superior’s bed and was leaning towards her, her elbow resting between her thighs, showing her her needlework. The Superior, her eyes almost shut, was saying ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ while hardly looking at her, and though I was standing next to her, she did not notice me. But her mind soon stopped wandering. The nun who had taken my place gave it back to me and I sat down again. Then, leaning gently towards the Superior, who had sat up a little on her pillows, I said nothing, but I looked at her as if I wanted to ask a favour. ‘So,’ she said, ‘what is it? Tell me, what do you want? How can I refuse you anything you ask?’","I was delighted to be able to do her this small service. I went back in. One of the others had taken my place at the bedside and was leaning over with her elbow between the Superior’s legs and showing her her work. The Superior, with half-closed eyes, was saying yes and no but hardly even looking, and she didn’t notice me standing there at her side. But she quickly came out of her moment of dreaming. The nun who had taken my place gave it back to me and I sat down again; and then, bending over slightly towards the Superior who had sat up a little against her pillows, said nothing, but looked at her as though I had a favour to beg. ‘ Well,’ she said, ‘what is it? Tell me, what do you want? How can I refuse you anything?’"
"J'arrivai dans l'église. Le grand vicaire y avait célébré la messe. La communauté y était assemblée. J'oubliais de vous dire que, quand je fus à la porte, ces trois religieuses qui me conduisaient me serraient, me poussaient avec violence, semblaient se tourmenter autour de moi, et m'entraînaient, les unes par les bras, tandis que d'autres me retenaient par derrière, comme si j'avais résisté, et que j'eusse répugné à entrer dans l'église; cependant il n'en était rien. On me conduisit vers les marches de l'autel: j'avais peine à me tenir debout; et l'on me tirait à genoux, comme si je refusais de m'y mettre; on me tenait comme si j'avais eu le dessein de fuir. On chanta le Veni, Creator; on exposa le Saint-Sacrement; on donna la bénédiction. Au moment de la bénédiction, où l'on s'incline par vénération, celles qui m'avaient saisie par le bras me courbèrent comme de force, et les autres m'appuyaient les mains sur les épaules. Je sentais ces différents mouvements; mais il m'était impossible d'en deviner la fin; enfin tout s'éclaircit.","I arrived in the church. The Vicar General had celebrated Mass there. The community was assembled there. I forgot to tell you that, when I was at the door, these three nuns who led me hugged me, pushed me violently, seemed to torment themselves around me, and dragged me away, some by the arms, while Others held me back, as if I had resisted and felt reluctant to enter the church; however it was not so. I was taken to the steps of the altar: I could hardly stand; and they dragged me to my knees, as if I refused to get down there; I was held as if I had intended to flee. They sang the Veni, Creator; the Blessed Sacrament was exposed; the blessing was given. At the moment of the blessing, when one bows out of veneration, those who had seized me by the arm bent me as if by force, and the others leaned their hands on my shoulders. I felt these different movements; but it was impossible for me to guess its end; finally everything cleared up.","I entered the church. The Vicar General had just finished celebrating Mass.

I was led towards the altar steps. I could hardly stand up and they dragged me on my knees to make it look as if I was refusing to stand there, and they kept hold of me as if I was about to run away. The Veni Creator was sung, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, and benediction was said. At that point in benediction when everyone bows in veneration, the nuns who had grabbed me by the arms made it look as if they were forcing me to bow, and the others pressed down on my shoulders. I could feel all these different movements, but I found it impossible to tell why they were making them. It all became clear in due course.","I reached the chapel.

"Voilà la vie que j'ai menée tant que mon procès a duré. Le parloir ne me fut pas tout à fait interdit; on ne pouvait m'ôter la liberté de conférer avec mes juges ni avec mon avocat; encore celui-ci fut-il obligé d'employer plusieurs fois la menace pour obtenir de me voir. Alors une sœur m'accompagnait; elle se plaignait, si je parlais bas; elle s'impatientait, si je restais trop; elle m'interrompait, me démentait, me contredisait, répétait à la supérieure mes discours, les altérait, les empoisonnait, m'en supposait même que je n'avais pas tenus; que sais-je? On en vint jusqu'à me voler, me dépouiller, m'ôter mes chaises, mes couvertures et mes matelas; on ne me donnait plus de linge blanc; mes vêtements se déchiraient; j'étais presque sans bas et sans souliers. J'avais peine à obtenir de l'eau; j'ai plusieurs fois été obligée d'en aller chercher moi-même au puits, à ce puits dont je vous ai parlé. On me cassa mes vaisseaux: alors j'en étais réduite à boire l'eau que j'avais tirée, sans en pouvoir emporter. Si je passais sous des fenêtres, j'étais obligée de fuir, ou de m'exposer à recevoir les immondices des cellules. Quelques sœurs m'ont craché au visage. J'étais devenue d'une malpropreté hideuse. Comme on craignait les plaintes que je pourrais faire à nos directeurs, la confession me fut interdite.","This is the life I led while my trial lasted. The parlor was not altogether forbidden to me; I could not be deprived of my freedom to confer with my judges or with my lawyer; even this one was obliged to use the threat several times to obtain to see me. Then a sister accompanied me; she complained if I spoke low; she grew impatient if I stayed too long; she interrupted me, contradicted me, contradicted me, repeated my speeches to the Superior, altered them, poisoned them, even supposed that I hadn't kept them; what do I know? They went so far as to rob me, strip me, take away my chairs, my blankets and my mattresses; I was given no more white linen; my clothes were torn; I was almost without stockings and without shoes. I had trouble getting water; I have several times been obliged to go and look for it myself at the well, at this well of which I spoke to you. They broke my vessels: then I was reduced to drinking the water I had drawn, without being able to carry it away. If I passed under windows, I was obliged to flee, or expose myself to receiving the filth of the cells. A few sisters spat in my face. I had become hideously filthy. As they feared the complaints I might make to our directors, confession was forbidden to me.","That is the kind of life I led while my lawsuit was going on. I was not completely forbidden to go into the parlour. I could not be denied the freedom to speak with my judges or my lawyer, but even Monsieur Manouri was forced several times to resort to threats in order to gain access to me. Another nun used to accompany me on these occasions. She would complain if I spoke too softly and grow impatient if I stayed too long. She would interrupt me, refute what I had said, contradict me, and she repeated my words to the Mother Superior, though she altered them, and poisoned them, even claimed I had said things that I had not, and so on. It even got to the stage of my being robbed and deprived of my belongings, and my chairs, bedding, and mattress were taken away. I was no longer given fresh undergarments, my clothes were torn, and I had almost worn out my stockings and sandals. It was difficult for me to obtain water, and on several occasions I was forced to go and fetch it for myself from the well, the one that I have told you about. My utensils had been smashed, so I had to drink the water that I had drawn there and then because I could not take it away with me. Whenever I walked beneath windows I had to hurry or have waste thrown at me from the cells. Some nuns spat in my face. I had become horribly dirty. Since it was feared that I might complain to our spiritual directors, I was forbidden to go to confession.","That is the life I led while my case was going on. The parlour was not quite out of bounds because they could not take away my freedom to confer with my judges and lawyer, but even then the latter had to use threats more than once in order to see me.

They did not stop at robbing me, stripping me, taking away my chairs, blankets and mattresses; I was given no more clean linen, my clothes were in rags and I was almost without shoes and stockings. I had trouble in getting water, and many times I had to go and find some myself at the well – that well I have told you about. They broke my utensils, and then I was reduced to drinking the water I had drawn up, having no means of taking any away.

Les jeunes ecclésiastiques me firent aussi leur compliment. Il était tard; M. Manouri prit congé de nous; l'archidiacre et ses compagnons allèrent chez M. ***, seigneur d'Arpajon, où ils étaient invités, et je restai seule avec la supérieure; mais ce ne fut pas pour longtemps: toutes les religieuses, toutes les novices, toutes les pensionnaires accoururent pêle-mêle: en un instant je me vis entourée d'une centaine de personnes. Je ne savais à qui entendre ni à qui répondre; c'étaient des figures de toute espèce et des propos de toutes couleurs; cependant je discernai qu'on n'était mécontent ni de mes réponses ni de ma personne.","The archdeacon did not hear this; but the superior replied: “Monsieur, as long as you like; she will do whatever pleases her; we will try here to make up for the pain that has been caused to him...» And then whispered to me: «My child, have you suffered so much? But how did those creatures from Longchamp have the courage to mistreat you? I knew your superior; we were boarders together at Port-Royal, it was the pet peeve of the others. We will have time to see each other; you will tell me all about it...» And while saying these words, she took one of my hands and struck me lightly with her own. The young ecclesiastics also paid me their compliments. It was late; M. Manouri took leave of us; the archdeacon and his companions went to M. ***, lord of Arpajon, where they were invited, and I remained alone with the superior; but it was not for long: all the nuns, all the novices, all the boarders came running pell-mell: in an instant I saw myself surrounded by a hundred people. I didn't know whom to listen to or who to answer; there were faces of all kinds and words of all colors; however, I discerned that no one was displeased either with my answers or with my person.","The Archdeacon did not hear him say that, but the Mother Superior replied: ‘Monsieur, as often as you wish; she will do whatever she wants. We shall try to make up here for the distress that she has been caused...’, and then she whispered to me: ‘My child, you really have suffered a great deal! But how could those creatures at Longchamp dare to mistreat you? I used to know your Mother Superior, she and I were boarders together at Port-Royal,* and she was the bane of everyone else’s life. We’ll have time to be with each other and you can tell me all about it...’ And as she spoke she held one of my hands and gently patted it. The young priests also paid me their compliments. It was late; Monsieur Manouri took his leave of us, the Archdeacon and his companions went to the home of Monsieur ***, lord of Arpajon, who had invited them to stay, and I was left alone with the Mother Superior, but not for long. All the nuns, novices, and boarders ran in together, and in an instant I was surrounded by about a hundred people. I did not know whom to listen to or whom to answer. There were people of all kinds, and they were saying all sorts of things. But I could tell that they were not disappointed by my replies or by me.","The Archdeacon did not hear all this, but the Superior chimed in: ‘Sir, as often as you like; she will do whatever you wish. We shall try here to make up for the troubles she has had inflicted upon her…’ Then she whispered to me: ‘My child, have you been through a great deal? How could those creatures at Longchamp have dared to ill-treat you so? I have met your Superior, we were trained together at Port-Royal, and she was everybody else’s pet abomination. We shall have time to see each other and you must tell me all about it, dear…’ As she said this she took one of my hands and tapped it gently with hers. The young priests also paid me their respects. It was late, Monsieur Manouri took his leave and the Archdeacon and his companions went to see the lord of the manor of Arpajon, who had invited them, and so I was left alone with the Superior; but not for long, for all the nuns, all the novices and all the boarders trooped in, and in an instant I was surrounded by a hundred people. There were faces of all kinds and things of all sorts being said, and I didn’t know whom to listen to or to answer, yet I could see that they were not displeased with my answers or with my person."
"Elle ne tarda pas à me tenir parole, et à m'en informer à notre manière accoutumée. La semaine sainte arriva; le concours à nos ténèbres fut nombreux.

Toutes ces suppositions roulent par la tête; on s'en entretient; on regarde, en se promenant dans le jardin, sans y penser, si les murs sont bien hauts; si l'on est dans sa cellule, on saisit les barreaux de sa grille, et on les ébranle doucement, de distraction; si l'on a la rue sous ses fenêtres, on y regarde; si l'on entend passer quelqu'un, le cœur palpite, on soupire sourdement après un libérateur; s'il s'élève quelque tumulte dont le bruit pénètre jusque dans la maison, on espère; on compte sur une maladie, qui nous approchera d'un homme, ou qui nous enverra aux eaux.","“Those that will be found with the doors open one day; that men will return from the extravagance of locking young living creatures in sepulchers, and that convents will be abolished; that the house will catch fire; that the walls of the enclosure will fall; someone will help them.

If they’re in their cells, they grab the bars over the window and shake them gently and distractedly. If the road runs beneath their window, they look at it. If they hear someone going past, their hearts race and, unheard by anyone, they yearn for someone to liberate them. If there’s some commotion outside and they hear it inside, they start to hope.

In the cell they seize the railings of the grille and absent-mindedly give them a gentle shake, if there is a street below the window they watch it, if they hear somebody going past, their hearts beat faster, they sigh for some rescuer. If there is some commotion outside and the noise is heard inside the house they hope, they look forward to some illness which will bring a man near to them or take them away for a cure.’"

"Je vais vous dire une chose qui vous paraîtra fort étrange peut-être, et qui n'en est pas moins vraie, c'est que je ne doute point que mes visites fréquentes vers ce puits n'aient été remarquées, et que mes cruelles ennemies ne se soient flattées qu'un jour j'accomplirais un dessein qui bouillait au fond de mon cœur. Quand j'allais de ce côté, on affectait de s'en éloigner et de regarder ailleurs. Plusieurs fois j'ai trouvé la porte du jardin ouverte à des heures où elle devait être fermée, singulièrement les jours où l'on avait multiplié sur moi les chagrins; l'on avait poussé à bout la violence de mon caractère, et l'on me croyait l'esprit aliéné. Mais aussitôt que je crus avoir deviné que ce moyen de sortir de la vie était pour ainsi dire offert à mon désespoir, qu'on me conduisait à ce puits par la main, et que je le trouverais toujours prêt à me recevoir, je ne m'en souciai plus; mon esprit se tourna vers d'autres côtés; je me tenais dans les corridors et mesurais la hauteur des fenêtres; le soir, en me déshabillant, j'essayais, sans y penser, la force de mes jarretières; un autre jour, je refusais le manger; je descendais au réfectoire, et je restais le dos appuyé contre la muraille, les mains pendantes à mes côtés, les yeux fermés, et je ne touchais pas aux mets qu'on avait servis devant moi; je m'oubliais si parfaitement dans cet état, que toutes les religieuses étaient sorties, et que je restais. On affectait alors de se retirer sans bruit, et l'on me laissait là; puis on me punissait d'avoir manqué aux exercices. Que vous dirai-je? on me dégoûta de presque tous les moyens de m'ôter la vie, parce qu'il me sembla que, loin de s'y opposer, on me les présentait. Nous ne voulons pas, apparemment, qu'on nous pousse hors de ce monde, et peut-être n'y serais-je plus, si elles avaient fait semblant de m'y retenir. Quand on s'ôte la vie, peut-être cherche-t-on à désespérer les autres, et la garde-t-on quand on croit les satisfaire; ce sont des mouvements qui se passent bien subtilement en nous. En vérité, s'il est possible que je me rappelle mon état, quand j'étais à côté du puits, il me semble que je criais au dedans de moi à ces malheureuses qui s'éloignaient pour favoriser un forfait: «Faites un pas de mon côté, montrez-moi le moindre désir de me sauver, accourez pour me retenir, et soyez sûres que vous arriverez trop tard.» En vérité, je ne vivais que parce qu'elles souhaitaient ma mort. L'acharnement à nuire, à tourmenter, se lasse dans le monde; il ne se lasse point dans les cloîtres.","I am going to tell you something which will perhaps seem very strange to you, and which is no less true for that, and that is that I have no doubt that my frequent visits to this well have been noticed, and that my cruel enemies have flattered themselves that one day I would accomplish a plan that was boiling in the bottom of my heart. When I went that way, people affected to get away from it and look elsewhere. Several times I found the door to the garden open at times when it should have been closed, particularly on days when the sorrows had been multiplied upon me; the violence of my character had been pushed to its limit, and I was thought to be mentally alienated. But as soon as I believed I had guessed that this means of escape from life was, so to speak, offered to my despair, that I was being led to this well by the hand, and that I would always find it ready to receive me, I did not leave. I didn't care anymore; my mind turned to other sides; I stood in the corridors and measured the height of the windows; in the evening, while undressing, I tried, without thinking about it, the strength of my garters; another day, I refused to eat it; I would go down to the refectory, and I would remain with my back leaning against the wall, my hands hanging by my side, my eyes closed, and I would not touch the dishes that had been served in front of me; I forgot myself so perfectly in this state that all the nuns had gone out, and I remained. They then affected to withdraw noiselessly, and left me there; then I was punished for having failed in the exercises. What shall I tell you? I was disgusted with almost all the means of taking my life, because it seemed to me that, far from opposing them, they were presented to me. We apparently don't want to be pushed out of this world, and maybe I wouldn't be there if they had pretended to keep me there. When one takes one's life, perhaps one seeks to drive others to despair, and one keeps it when one believes to satisfy them; these are movements that happen very subtly in us. In truth, if it is possible that I remember my state, when I was next to the well, it seems to me that I cried inside me to these unfortunates who went away to encourage a crime: ""Take a step on my side, show me the slightest desire to save me, hasten to hold me back, and be sure that you will arrive too late.” In truth, I only lived because they wanted me dead. The determination to harm, to torment, is weary in the world; he never tires of the cloisters.","I am going to tell you something which may well seem very strange to you, but which is nevertheless true. It is that I am absolutely sure that my frequent visits to the well were noticed, and that my cruel enemies cherished the hope that one day I might carry out the plan that was burning away deep in my heart. Whenever I went towards the well, the others made a show of going the other way and looking elsewhere. On a number of occasions I found the garden gate left open at times when it was supposed to be locked, and especially on days when they had been particularly cruel to me, when they had stretched my violent character to breaking point and thought me out of my mind. But as soon as I thought I had guessed that this way out of life was, so to speak, being offered to me in my despair, that I was being led by the hand to the well which I would always find ready to receive me, I worried about it no more. My mind turned to other things. I stood in the corridors and measured the height of the windows. In the evenings, as I was getting undressed, quite without thinking about it, I tested the strength of my garters. Another day I refused food. I went down to the refectory and stood with my back to the wall, with my hands by my sides and my eyes closed, and I did not touch any of the food that had been put in front of me. I lost myself so completely in this state that I was left there all alone after the other nuns had gone. They made a point of withdrawing in silence and leaving me there, and then I was punished for having missed the service. What can I say? They turned me against almost every available means of killing myself, because it struck me that, far from opposing them, they were openly presenting these means to me. Apparently we do not like being forced out of this world, and perhaps I would not still be here now if they had pretended to want to stop me. When people take their own lives, perhaps they are trying to drive others to despair, and they hold back from doing it when they think it is precisely what others want them to do. There are subtle processes going on in our minds. In fact, if I can recall the state I was in when I was next to the well, it is as if I was, deep within me, screaming at those wretched women who went the other way so as to facilitate a crime: ‘Just take one step in my direction, show at least the slightest desire to save me, run to stop me, and rest assured that you’ll be too late.’ In fact I only carried on living because they wanted me to die. The urge to torment and destroy others gradually weakens in the real world, but never in convents.","I am going to tell you something which may seem very strange to you, but is nevertheless true; it is that I have no doubt whatever that my frequent visits to the well were noticed, and that my cruel enemies hoped that one day I would carry out the scheme maturing in my heart Whenever I moved in that direction they made a point of going the other way and of looking elsewhere. Several times I found the garden gate left open at hours when it should have been shut, and significantly on days when troubles had been heaped upon me. They had strained my violent character to breaking point, and thought my mind was deranged. But as soon as I thought I had realized that this way of quitting life was, so to speak, being offered to my despair, that I was being led by the hand to that well which I should always find ready to welcome me, I ceased to bother about it and my thoughts turned into other channels. I stood about in corridors and gauged the height of windows. At night, as I undressed, I unconsciously tested the strength of my garters. Another day I refused to eat; I went down to the refectory and stood with my back to the wall, hands dangling at my sides and eyes shut, refusing to touch any of the food they had set before me, but standing there in such a rapt state that I was still there when all the nuns had left. So a point was made of stealing off noiselessly and leaving me there, and then I was punished for having failed to be present at office. In fact, they turned me against almost every way of taking my own life because I felt that far from being discouraging they were making opportunities for me. Apparently we don’t like being pushed out of this world, and perhaps I should not have still been here had they shown signs of wanting to keep me. When we take our own lives, perhaps it is to infuriate other people, and we might stay alive if we thought we were giving them satisfaction – these are very subtle processes going on within us. As a matter of fact, if I can recall the state I was in when I was by the well, it seems to me that deep within me I was crying out to these creatures who were moving away so as to facilitate a crime: ‘Just take one step in my direction, show the slightest desire to save me, run to stop me, and rest assured that you will get here too late.’ In fact I only went on living because they were wishing for my death. The urge to hurt and torment gradually wanes in the world outside; it never does in the cloister."

"—Je ne saurais dormir, me répondit-elle; je ne dormirai de longtemps. Ce sont des songes fâcheux qui me tourmentent; à peine ai-je les yeux fermés, que les peines que vous avez souffertes se retracent à mon imagination; je vous vois entre les mains de ces inhumaines, je vois vos cheveux épars sur votre visage, je vous vois les pieds ensanglantés, la torche au poing, la corde au cou; je crois qu'elles vont disposer de votre vie; je frissonne, je tremble; une sueur froide se répand sur tout mon corps; je veux aller à votre secours; je pousse des cris, je m'éveille, et c'est inutilement que j'attends que le sommeil revienne. Voilà ce qui m'est arrivé cette nuit; j'ai craint que le ciel ne m'annonçât quelque malheur arrivé à mon amie; je me suis levée, je me suis approchée de votre porte, j'ai écouté; il m'a semblé que vous ne dormiez pas; vous avez parlé, je me suis retirée; je suis revenue, vous avez encore parlé, et je me suis encore éloignée; je suis revenue une troisième fois; et lorsque j'ai cru que vous dormiez, je suis entrée. Il y a déjà quelque temps que je suis à côté de vous, et que je crains de vous éveiller: j'ai balancé d'abord si je tirerais vos rideaux; je voulais m'en aller, crainte de troubler votre repos; mais je n'ai pu résister au désir de voir si ma chère Suzanne se portait bien; je vous ai regardée: que vous êtes belle à voir, même quand vous dormez!","""I cannot sleep,"" she replied; I won't sleep long.

I have been by your side for some time now, and I fear to wake you up: I hesitated at first if I would draw your curtains; I wanted to go away for fear of disturbing your rest; but I could not resist the desire to see if my dear Suzanne was well; I looked at you: how beautiful you are to see, even when you sleep!","‘I can’t sleep,’ she replied, ‘and I shan’t sleep for a long time.

"Mais voici un trait qui vous paraîtra bien plus étrange qu'aucun autre. Je ne sais si c'est méchanceté ou illusion; c'est que, quoique je ne fisse rien qui marquât un esprit dérangé, à plus forte raison un esprit obsédé de l'esprit infernal, elles délibérèrent entre elles s'il ne fallait pas m'exorciser; et il fut conclu, à la pluralité des voix, que j'avais renoncé à mon chrême et à mon baptême; que le démon résidait en moi, et qu'il m'éloignait des offices divins. Une autre ajouta qu'à certaines prières je grinçais des dents et que je frémissais dans l'église; qu'à l'élévation du Saint-Sacrement je me tordais les bras. Une autre, que je foulais le Christ aux pieds et que je ne portais plus mon rosaire (qu'on m'avait volé); que je proférais des blasphèmes que je n'ose vous répéter. Toutes, qu'il se passait en moi quelque chose qui n'était pas naturel, et qu'il fallait en donner avis au grand vicaire; ce qui fut fait.","But here is one trait that will strike you as far stranger than any other. I don't know if it's malice or illusion; it is that, although I did nothing which marked a disturbed spirit, a fortiori a spirit obsessed with the infernal spirit, they deliberated among themselves whether they should not exorcise me; and it was concluded, by a plurality of votes, that I had renounced my chrism and my baptism; that the demon resided in me, and that it kept me away from the divine offices. Another added that at certain prayers I gritted my teeth and quivered in church; that at the elevation of the Blessed Sacrament I wrung my arms. Another, that I was trampling on Christ and no longer wearing my rosary (which had been stolen from me); that I uttered blasphemies that I dare not repeat to you.

Another nun added that when certain prayers were said in church I gnashed my teeth and trembled and that at the elevation of the Blessed Sacrament I contorted my arms. Another said that I trampled on the crucifix and that I no longer carried my rosary with me (which had been stolen from me), that I uttered blasphemies which I dare not repeat to you. And all said that there was something unnatural happening to me and that the Vicar General should be told about it, and so he was.","But here is something that will appear stranger to you than anything else.

"Sans savoir qu'on prendrait ces inquiétudes, je sentis qu'il ne fallait pas qu'on trouvât chez moi un écrit de cette importance. D'abord je pensai à le coudre dans mon traversin ou dans mes matelas, puis à le cacher dans mes vêtements, à l'enfouir dans le jardin, à le jeter au feu. Vous ne sauriez croire combien je fus pressée de l'écrire, et combien j'en fus embarrassée quand il fut écrit. D'abord je le cachetai, ensuite je le serrai dans mon sein, et j'allai à l'office qui sonnait. J'étais dans une inquiétude qui se décelait à mes mouvements. J'étais assise à côté d'une jeune religieuse qui m'aimait; quelquefois je l'avais vue me regarder en pitié et verser des larmes: elle ne me parlait point, mais certainement elle souffrait. Au risque de tout ce qui pourrait en arriver, je résolus de lui confier mon papier; dans un moment d'oraison où toutes les religieuses se mettent à genoux, s'inclinent, et sont comme plongées dans leurs stalles, je tirai doucement le papier de mon sein, et je le lui tendis derrière moi; elle le prit, et le serra dans le sien. Ce service fut le plus important de ceux qu'elle m'avait rendus; mais j'en avais reçu beaucoup d'autres: elle s'était occupée pendant des mois entiers à lever, sans se compromettre, tous les petits obstacles qu'on apportait à mes devoirs pour avoir droit de me châtier; elle venait frapper à ma porte quand il était heure de sortir; elle arrangeait ce qu'on dérangeait; elle allait sonner ou répondre quand il le fallait; elle se trouvait partout où je devais être. J'ignorais tout cela.","Without knowing that these anxieties would be taken on board, I felt that they should not find a writing of this importance in my house. First I thought of sewing it into my bolster or my mattress, then hiding it in my clothes, burying it in the garden, throwing it on the fire. You cannot believe how eager I was to write it, and how embarrassed I was when it was written. First I sealed it, then I clasped it in my bosom, and I went to the pantry, which was ringing. I was in a state of anxiety that was revealed by my movements. I was seated next to a young nun who loved me; sometimes I had seen her look at me with pity and shed tears: she did not speak to me, but she certainly suffered. At the risk of everything that might come of it, I resolved to entrust my paper to him; in a moment of prayer when all the nuns kneel, bow, and are as if plunged into their stalls, I gently drew the paper from my bosom, and held it out to her behind me; she took it, and clasped it in hers. This service was the most important of those she had rendered me; but I had received many others: she had busied herself for whole months in removing, without compromising herself, all the little obstacles that were brought to my duties in order to have the right to chastise me; she came knocking at my door when it was time to go out; she arranged what was disturbed; she would ring or answer when necessary; she was everywhere I needed to be. I was unaware of all this.","Though I did not know how concerned they would be, I realized that I could not let such an important document be found in my cell. My first thought was to sew it in my bolster or my mattress. Then I thought of hiding it in my clothes, burying it in the garden, or throwing it on the fire. You will never believe what a hurry I was in to write it and how worried I was once I had finished it. First I sealed it and then hid it in my bosom before going off to the office, for which the bell was ringing. My every movement betrayed how nervous I was. I was sitting next to a nun who was fond of me. I had sometimes seen her looking at me pitifully, tears in her eyes. She said nothing to me, but I am sure that she was suffering. Risking all the possible consequences, I decided to entrust my statement to her. At the point in the prayers when all the nuns kneel and bow their heads and are, so to speak, buried in their stalls, I quickly pulled the paper from my bosom and handed it to her behind my back. She took it and hid it in her bosom. This was the most important thing she had ever done for me, though she had done many other things before. Without getting herself into trouble, she had spent several months removing the obstacles that were put in my way so as to prevent me doing my duties and to give the others an excuse to punish me. She would come and knock on my door when it was time to come out; she would tidy up what had deliberately been messed up; she would go and ring the bell or answer it when necessary; she was wherever I was meant to be. I knew nothing of all that then.","Although I did not know that they would be so concerned about it, I felt that a document of this importance must not be found in my possession.

La tête me brûle, ôtez-moi mes coiffes... Je veux me laver... Apportez-moi de l'eau; versez, versez encore... Elles sont blanches; mais la souillure de l'âme est restée... Je voudrais être morte; je voudrais n'être point née, je ne l'aurais point vue.»","In another moment, she said, “Did our sisters come back? Tell them that I am very ill... Lift my pillow... Untie me... I feel something oppressing me here... My head is burning, take off my caps... I want wash myself... Bring me some water; pour, pour again... They are white; but the defilement of the soul remained... I would like to be dead; I wish I hadn't been born, I wouldn't have seen her.""","On another occasion she would say: ‘Have our sisters come back? Tell them I’m very ill... Lift up my pillow... Loosen my nightdress... I can feel something weighing down on me there... My head’s burning; take off my nightcap... I want to get washed... Fetch me some water. Pour it out, keep on pouring... They are white, but the stain on the soul still lingers... I wish I were dead, I wish I hadn’t been born; that way I wouldn’t have seen her.’","At another time she would say: ‘Have our sisters come back? Tell them I am very ill … Lift up my pillow… Unlace me… I can feel something weighing down on me there… My head is burning, take off my coif… I want to wash … Bring some water, pour it out, go on pouring… They are white, but the stain on the soul is still there… I wish I were dead, I wish I had never been born, and then I wouldn’t have seen her!’"
"—Je suis stupide; j'obéis à mon sort sans répugnance et sans goût; je sens que la nécessité m'entraîne, et je me laisse aller. Ah! ma chère mère, je ne sens rien de cette douce joie, de ce tressaillement, de cette mélancolie, de cette douce inquiétude que j'ai quelquefois remarquée dans celles qui se trouvaient au moment où je suis. Je suis imbécile, je ne saurais même pleurer. On le veut, il le faut, est la seule idée qui me vienne... Mais vous ne me dites rien.","-I am stupid; I obey my fate without repugnance and without taste; I feel that necessity is dragging me along, and I let myself go. Ah! my dear mother, I feel nothing of that sweet joy, of that thrill, of that melancholy, of that sweet uneasiness that I have sometimes noticed in those who were at the time when I am. I'm stupid, I can't even cry. We want it, we have to, is the only idea that comes to me... But you don't tell me anything.","I’m accepting my fate with neither disgust nor inclination. I feel as if necessity is carrying me along and I’m letting myself go. Oh! My dear Mother, I feel nothing of that sweet joy, that quivering, that melancholy, that sweet anxiety that I’ve sometimes noticed in those in my position. I’m stunned, I can’t even cry. This is what is wanted, this is what is required of me: that’s all I can think about... But you’re not saying anything.’","‘I am dazed, I am fulfilling my destiny without finding it repugnant or attractive, I feel I am being carried along by necessity and am letting myself go. Oh, Reverend Mother, I feel none of that sweet joy, thrill, melancholy or pleasurable anxiety I have sometimes observed in others when they were at the stage I am now. I am numb, I cannot even cry. It is insisted on, it has to be done, and that is the only thought I have about it. But you are not saying anything.’"
"La première, ce fut de m'abandonner à toute la douleur que je ressentais de la perte de notre première supérieure; d'en faire l'éloge en toute circonstance; d'occasionner entre elle et celle qui nous gouvernait des comparaisons qui n'étaient pas favorables à celle-ci; de peindre l'état de la maison sous les années passées; de rappeler au souvenir la paix dont nous jouissions, l'indulgence qu'on avait pour nous, la nourriture tant spirituelle que temporelle qu'on nous administrait alors, et d'exalter les mœurs, les sentiments, le caractère de la sœur de Moni. La seconde, ce fut de jeter au feu le cilice, et de me défaire de ma discipline; de prêcher des amies là-dessus, et d'en engager quelques-unes à suivre mon exemple; la troisième, de me pourvoir d'un Ancien et d'un Nouveau Testament; la quatrième, de rejeter tout parti, de m'en tenir au titre de chrétienne, sans accepter le nom de janséniste ou de moliniste; la cinquième, de me renfermer rigoureusement dans la règle de la maison, sans vouloir rien faire ni en delà ni en deçà; conséquemment, de ne me prêter à aucune action surérogatoire, celles d'obligation ne me paraissant déjà que trop dures; de ne monter à l'orgue que les jours de fête; de ne chanter que quand je serais de chœur; de ne plus souffrir qu'on abusât de ma complaisance et de mes talents, et qu'on me mît à tout et à tous les jours. Je lus les constitutions, je les relus, je les savais par cœur; si l'on m'ordonnait quelque chose, ou qui n'y fût pas exprimé clairement, ou qui n'y fût pas, ou qui m'y parût contraire, je m'y refusais fermement; je prenais le livre, et je disais: «Voilà les engagements que j'ai pris, et je n'en ai point pris d'autres.»","The first was to abandon myself to all the pain I felt at the loss of our first superior; to praise it in all circumstances; to occasion between her and her who governed us comparisons which were not favorable to the latter; to paint the state of the house under the past years; to recall to memory the peace we enjoyed, the indulgence they had for us, the food, both spiritual and temporal, that they administered to us then, and to exalt the morals, the feelings, the character of the sister of Moni . The second was to throw the hair shirt into the fire and get rid of my discipline; to preach to friends about it, and to urge some to follow my example; the third, to provide myself with an Old and a New Testament; the fourth, to reject any party, to stick to the title of Christian, without accepting the name of Jansenist or Molinist; the fifth, to confine myself rigorously to the rules of the house, without wanting to do anything either above or below; consequently, not to lend myself to any supererogatory action, those of obligation already appearing to me only too harsh; not to mount the organ except on feast days; to sing only when I was in choir; to no longer allow my complaisance and my talents to be abused, and that I be put to everything and every day. I read the constitutions, I reread them, I knew them by heart; if I was ordered to do something, either which was not clearly expressed there, or which was not there, or which seemed to me to be contrary to it, I firmly refused; I took the book, and I said: ""Here are the commitments that I have made, and I have not made any others.""","The first thing I did was to abandon myself to all the pain that I felt at the loss of our Mother Superior and to sing her praises at every opportunity, to suggest comparisons between her and the new Mother Superior which were unfavourable to the latter, to describe what the convent was like in years gone by, to recall the peace we used to enjoy, the kind treatment we enjoyed, the food that was given to us, both spiritual and temporal, and to praise the morals, feelings, and character of Sister de Moni. The second thing I did was to throw my hair-shirt on the fire and to get rid of my scourge, to tell my friends all about what I had done, and to encourage some of them to follow my example. The third thing I did was to obtain a copy of the Old and New Testaments. The fourth thing I did was to reject all sects, to content myself with being called a Christian and to refuse to be called a Jansenist or a Molinist. * The fifth thing I did was to conform strictly to the rules of the convent, refusing to do any more or less, and therefore not performing any supererogatory acts, since the obligatory ones already struck me as too harsh anyway. I chose only to go up into the organ loft on feast days and to sing only when I had to be in the choir. No longer would I allow my good will and talents to be taken advantage of, nor would I allow myself to be coerced into doing every kind of duty, every day. I read and reread the rules of the order until I knew them by heart. If I was told to do something which was either not set out clearly in the rules or not in them at all, or which seemed to me to run counter to them, I would refuse categorically. I would pick up the book and say: ‘Here are the promises I’ve made; I haven’t made any others.’","The first thing I did was to give myself up to all the grief I felt at the loss of our first Superior, and sing her praises on every occasion, make comparisons between her and our present ruler which were unfortunate for the latter, describe the state of the convent in previous years, call back to mind the peace we used to enjoy, the kindly treatment we had, the food, both spiritual and material, we used to be given, and laud to the skies the way of life, sentiments and character of Sister de Moni. The next was to throw my hair-shirt into the fire and take off my discipline, preach on the subject to my friends and urge some of them to follow my example. The third was to provide myself with an Old and New Testament, and the fourth to dissociate myself from any sect and merely call myself a Christian, refusing to accept names like Jansenist or Molinist, the fifth to keep rigorously to the rule of the house and do nothing beyond it or short of it, and consequently not lend myself to any non-obligatory practices, for the obligatory ones seemed too rigorous as it was. For instance, I did not go into the organ loft except on Holy-days of Obligation, nor sing except when I was on choir duty, and put an end to letting them take advantage of my goodwill and my talents to make me do everything every day. I read and re-read our regulations and knew them by heart, so that if I was directed to do anything which was either not clearly set out therein or not there at all, or which seemed to contradict them , I refused absolutely, but took up the book and said: ‘Here are the promises I made, and I made no others.’"
"Cette supérieure s'appelle madame ***. Je ne saurais me refuser à l'envie de vous la peindre avant que d'aller plus loin. C'est une petite femme toute ronde, cependant prompte et vive dans ses mouvements: sa tête n'est jamais assise sur ses épaules; il y a toujours quelque chose qui cloche dans son vêtement; sa figure est plutôt bien que mal; ses yeux, dont l'un, c'est le droit, est plus haut et plus grand que l'autre, sont pleins de feu et distraits: quand elle marche, elle jette ses bras en avant et en arrière. Veut-elle parler? elle ouvre la bouche, avant que d'avoir arrangé ses idées; aussi bégaye-t-elle un peu. Est-elle assise? elle s'agite sur son fauteuil, comme si quelque chose l'incommodait: elle oublie toute bienséance; elle lève sa guimpe pour se frotter la peau; elle croise les jambes; elle vous interroge; vous lui répondez, et elle ne vous écoute pas; elle vous parle, et elle se perd, s'arrête tout court, ne sait plus où elle en est, se fâche, et vous appelle grosse bête, stupide, imbécile, si vous ne la remettez sur la voie: elle est tantôt familière jusqu'à tutoyer, tantôt impérieuse et fière jusqu'au dédain; ses moments de dignité sont courts; elle est alternativement compatissante et dure; sa figure décomposée marque tout le décousu de son esprit et toute l'inégalité de son caractère; aussi l'ordre et le désordre se succédaient-ils dans la maison; il y avait des jours où tout était confondu, les pensionnaires avec les novices, les novices avec les religieuses; où l'on courait dans les chambres les unes des autres; où l'on prenait ensemble du thé, du café, du chocolat, des liqueurs; où l'office se faisait avec la célérité la plus indécente; au milieu de ce tumulte le visage de la supérieure change subitement, la cloche sonne; on se renferme, on se retire, le silence le plus profond suit le bruit, les cris et le tumulte, et l'on croirait que tout est mort subitement. Une religieuse alors manque-t-elle à la moindre chose? elle la fait venir dans sa cellule, la traite avec dureté, lui ordonne de se déshabiller et de se donner vingt coups de discipline; la religieuse obéit, se déshabille, prend sa discipline, et se macère; mais à peine s'est-elle donné quelques coups, que la supérieure, devenue compatissante, lui arrache l'instrument de pénitence, se met à pleurer, dit qu'elle est bien malheureuse d'avoir à punir, lui baise le front, les yeux, la bouche, les épaules; la caresse, la loue16. «Mais, qu'elle a la peau blanche et douce! le bel embonpoint! le beau cou! le beau chignon!... Sœur Sainte-Augustine, mais tu es folle d'être honteuse; laisse tomber ce linge; je suis femme, et ta supérieure. Oh! la belle gorge! qu'elle est ferme! et je souffrirais que cela fût déchiré par des pointes? Non, non, il n'en sera rien...» Elle la baise encore, la relève, la rhabille elle-même, lui dit les choses les plus douces, la dispense des offices, et la renvoie dans sa cellule. On est très-mal avec ces femmes-là; on ne sait jamais ce qui leur plaira ou déplaira, ce qu'il faut éviter ou faire; il n'y a rien de réglé; ou l'on est servi à profusion, ou l'on meurt de faim; l'économie de la maison s'embarrasse, les remontrances sont ou mal prises ou négligées; on est toujours trop près ou trop loin des supérieures de ce caractère; il n'y a ni vraie distance, ni mesure; on passe de la disgrâce à la faveur, et de la faveur à la disgrâce, sans qu'on sache pourquoi. Voulez-vous que je vous donne, dans une petite chose, un exemple général de son administration? Deux fois l'année, elle courait de cellule en cellule, et faisait jeter par les fenêtres toutes les bouteilles de liqueur qu'elle y trouvait, et quatre jours après, elle-même en renvoyait à la plupart de ses religieuses. Voilà celle à qui j'avais fait le vœu solennel d'obéissance; car nous portons nos vœux d'une maison dans une autre17.","This superior is called Madame ***. I cannot resist the desire to paint it for you before going any further. She is a round little woman, yet quick and lively in her movements: her head is never seated on her shoulders; there's always something wrong with his clothes; his figure is rather good than bad; her eyes, one of which, it is right, is higher and larger than the other, are full of fire and distracted: when she walks, she throws her arms back and forth. Does she want to talk? she opens her mouth before she has settled her ideas; so she stutters a little. Is she sitting? she fidgets about in her armchair, as if something bothers her: she forgets all propriety; she lifting her skirt to rub her skin ; she crosses her legs; she questions you; you answer her, and she does not listen to you; she talks to you, and she gets lost, stops short, doesn't know where she is, gets angry, and calls you stupid, stupid, imbecile, if you don't put her back on the track: she is sometimes familiar until familiar, sometimes imperious and proud to the point of disdain; his moments of dignity are short; she is alternately compassionate and harsh; his decomposed face marks all the disjointedness of his mind and all the inequality of his character; also order and disorder succeeded each other in the house; there were days when everything was confused, the boarders with the novices, the novices with the nuns; where we ran into each other's rooms; where we drank together tea, coffee, chocolate, liqueurs; where the office was performed with the most indecent celerity; in the midst of this tumult the face of the superior suddenly changes, the bell rings; one withdraws, one withdraws, the deepest silence follows the noise, the cries and the tumult, and one would think that everything died suddenly. So is a nun lacking in the slightest thing? she summons her to her cell, treats her harshly, orders her to undress and to discipline herself twenty times; the nun obeys, undresses, takes her discipline, and macerates; but hardly had she given herself a few blows than the superior, having become compassionate, snatched the instrument of penance from her, began to cry, said that she was very unhappy to have to punish, kissed her forehead, eyes, mouth, shoulders; caress her, praise her. “But, she has white and soft skin! beautiful plumpness! beautiful neck! the beautiful chignon!... Sister Sainte-Augustine, but you are mad to be ashamed; drop this laundry; I am a woman, and your superior. Oh! beautiful throat! how firm she is! and I would suffer it to be torn by spikes? No, no, it won't be...” She kisses her again, picks her up, dresses her herself, says the sweetest things to her, exempts her from the services, and sends her back to her cell. One is very badly with these women; you never know what will please or displease them, what to avoid or do; nothing is settled; either one is served in abundance, or one dies of hunger; the economy of the house is embarrassed, remonstrances are either badly taken or neglected; one is always too near or too far from superiors of this character; there is neither true distance nor measure; we pass from disgrace to favour, and from favor to disgrace, without knowing why. Shall I give you, in a little thing, a general example of his administration? Twice a year she ran from cell to cell and had all the bottles of liquor she found there thrown out of the windows, and four days later she herself sent it back to most of her nuns. This is the one to whom I had made the solemn vow of obedience; for we carry our vows from one house to another.","This Mother Superior is called Madame ***. * I simply cannot deny myself the pleasure of painting her portrait for you before I go any further. She is a short, plump woman, yet quick and lively in her movements; she never keeps her head still; there is always something wrong with her clothes; her appearance is not unattractive; her fiery eyes are always darting about, and one of them, the right one, is higher and bigger than the other; she swings her arms to and fro as she walks; when she wants to speak, she opens her mouth before she has thought out what she wants to say, so she stutters a little; when she is sitting down, she fidgets in her chair as if something is bothering her. Forgetting all sense of decorum, she lifts up her wimple so that she can scratch herself, and she crosses her legs; she asks you questions and you answer her, but she does not listen; as she speaks to you, she loses her train of thought and stops suddenly, unable to remember what she has said, and she gets cross and calls you a silly ass, stupid, or foolish if you do not remind her what she was saying. Sometimes she addresses you informally; sometimes she is imperious and scornfully self-righteous. Her moments of dignity are short lived; one minute she is compassionate, the next stony-hearted. Her drawn face illustrates all the disjointedness of her mind and all the unevenness of her character; so order and disorder succeed each other in the convent. There were some days when everything was confused, the boarders mixed in with the novices,* and the novices with the nuns; days when people ran in and out of each other’s rooms; days when people gathered to have tea, coffee, chocolate, and alcohol; days when the services were conducted with the most unseemly haste; and then in the midst of all this hubbub, the Mother Superior’s face changes suddenly, the bell rings, everyone withdraws and retires to their cells, and the noise, screams, and commotion give way to the deepest silence, such that you would think that everything had suddenly died. At such times, if a nun does the slightest thing wrong, the Mother Superior summons her to her cell, deals with her harshly, and orders her to get undressed and to give herself twenty strokes with her scourge; the nun obeys, gets undressed, picks up her scourge, and mortifies her flesh, but no sooner has she given herself a few strokes than the Mother Superior, overwhelmed with pity, snatches the instrument of penitence from her and starts crying; how dreadful it is for her to have to punish people! She kisses her on the forehead, eyes, mouth, and shoulders, caresses her, and sings her praises: ‘ Oh but how white and soft her skin is! What a beautifully full figure! What a beautiful neck! What a beautiful nape! Sister Sainte Augustine, don’t be silly, there’s no need to be ashamed , undo your undergarments, I am a woman and your Mother Superior... Oh what a beautiful breast! How firm it is!... And to think of letting it be cut by the spikes of a scourge? No, no, certainly not...’ She kisses her again, lifts her up, puts her clothes back on for her, says the sweetest things to her, gives her permission not to attend the services, and sends her back to her cell. It is very difficult being with women like that, as you never know what they are going to like or dislike, what you need to avoid doing or what you need to do. Nothing is fixed: either you are served copious amounts of food or you are left to starve to death; the administration of the convent gets into a muddle, and your objections are either badly received or ignored. You always find yourself either too close to or too remote from Mothers Superior like that; there is no sense of proper distance or balance; you pass from disgrace to favour and from favour to disgrace without knowing why. Let me tell you about one small thing which is typical of how she runs the convent in general. Twice a year she would run from cell to cell and would have all the bottles of alcohol she found thrown out of the windows, but four days later she would send bottles back to most of the nuns. This was the woman to whom I had made my solemn vow of obedience, for we take our vows with us from one convent to the next.","This Superior is called Madame∗∗∗. I cannot resist my desire to describe her before going any further. She is short and quite plump, yet quick and lively in her movements, her head is never held straight on her shoulders, there is always something wrong with her clothes, her face is good-looking rather than plain, and her eyes, one of which, the right one, is higher and larger than the other, are full of fire and far-away looking. When she walks she swings her arms backwards and forwards. Should she want to speak, she opens her mouth before sorting out her ideas, so she tends to – um and -ah somewhat Should she be sitting down she wriggles on her chair as though something were bothering her, forgetting all sense of decorum she lifts her wimple so as to scratch, crosses her legs, asks you questions but does not listen when you answer, says something to you, loses the thread and stops short, has forgotten where she is, gets annoyed and calls you a great silly, foolish, stupid if you don’t set her on the right track again; she is sometimes familiar to the point of my-dearing you, and sometimes haughty and imperious to the point of disdain; her moments of dignity are short, she is in turn compassionate and hard, her ever-changing expression indicates the disconnectedness of her mind and all the instability of her character. And so order and disorder succeed each other in the convent: there were days when everything was at sixes and sevens, boarders mixed up with novices, novices with nuns, and people ran in and out of each other’s rooms, everybody had tea, coffee, chocolate or liqueurs together and the church services were rushed through with the most unseemly haste, and then in the middle of this tumult the Superior’s face would suddenly change, the bell tolled, everyone shut herself up and retired, and the deepest silence followed the din, the shouting and tumult, and you would have thought everything had suddenly died. If at such a time a nun should be in the slightest degree remiss, she sends for her, treats her harshly, orders her to undress and give herself twenty strokes with the scourge. The nun obeys, takes off her clothes, takes up the scourge and chastises herself, but scarcely has she given herself one or two strokes than the Superior comes over all compassionate, snatches the instrument of penitence away from her, bursts into tears and says how dreadful it is for her to have to punish anybody, kisses the nun on the forehead, eyes, mouth and shoulders, caresses and flatters her: ‘But what a soft, white skin she has! such a lovely figure! lovely neck and hair! Sister Sainte-Augustine, you really are silly to be so bashful, slip off your chemise, I am a woman, dear, and your Superior. Oh what a beautiful bosom! And so firm! And could I let it be torn by spikes? No, no, nothing of the kind…’ She then kisses her again, helps her up, dresses her herself, saying all sorts of nice things to her, excuses her from office and sends her back to her cell. You are very ill at ease with women like that and never know what will please or displease them, what to avoid or do; nothing is stable, you are either served lavishly or dying of hunger, the running of the institution gets into a muddle, any remonstrances are taken the wrong way or else ignored. You are always too near or too far away from Superiors of this kind, there is no real distance or proportion; you pass from disgrace to favour and from favour to disgrace without knowing why. Let me give you one little thing as an example of the whole of her administration. Twice a year she would run round from cell to cell and have any bottles of spirits she found thrown out of the windows, and four days later she herself would send some more to most of the nuns. Such was the woman to whom I had made a solemn vow of obedience, for we transfer our vows from one convent to another."
"—Un conseil qu'une bonne et sage supérieure devrait suivre avec toutes celles pour qui leur couvent est une prison; et le couvent en est une pour moi mille fois plus affreuse que celles qui renferment les malfaiteurs; il faut que j'en sorte ou que j'y périsse.

"Elle demeura un moment en silence, puis elle sortit et rentra avec quatre de ses favorites; elles avaient l'air égaré et furieux. Je me jetai à leurs pieds, j'implorai leur miséricorde. Elles criaient toutes ensemble: «Point de miséricorde, madame; ne vous laissez pas toucher: qu'elle donne ses papiers, ou qu'elle aille en paix13...» J'embrassais les genoux tantôt de l'une, tantôt de l'autre; je leur disais, en les nommant par leurs noms: «Sœur Sainte-Agnès, sœur Sainte-Julie, que vous ai-je fait?

They shouted in chorus: ‘No pity, Reverend Mother, don’t let your heart be touched, let her hand over her documents or be sent to the punishment cell. ’∗ ‘I clasped the knees of each in turn, addressing them by name: ‘Sister Sainte-Agnes, Sister Sainte-Julie, what harm have I done to you? Why are you turning Reverend Mother against me? Have I ever behaved in that way? How many times have I interceded for you? You have forgotten now. You were to blame then, but now I am not.’"
"«C'est, me répondit-elle, par ce que vous m'allez dire que vous le mériterez. Levez-vous; votre père est absent, vous avez tout le temps de vous expliquer. Vous avez vu le père Séraphin, vous savez enfin qui vous êtes, et ce que vous pouvez attendre de moi, si votre projet n'est pas de me punir toute ma vie d'une faute que je n'ai déjà que trop expiée. Eh bien! mademoiselle, que me voulez-vous? Qu'avez-vous résolu?","""It is,"" she replied, ""by what you are going to tell me that you will deserve it."" Stand up; your father is absent, you have plenty of time to explain yourself. You have seen Father Seraphin, you finally know who you are, and what you can expect from me, if your plan is not to punish me all my life for a fault that I have already atoned for too much. Well! Miss, what do you want from me? What have you solved?","‘You’ll earn my pardon’, she said, ‘by what you have to say. Get up. Your father is away, so you have all the time you need to explain yourself. You’ve seen Father Séraphin, so you now know who you are and what you can expect of me, if you intend not to punish me for the rest of my life for a mistake for which I have already paid so dearly. So, Mademoiselle! What do you expect of me? What have you decided to do?’","‘That,’ she answered, ‘will depend on what you are going to say. Get up; your father is away and you have plenty of time to say what you want. You have seen Father Séraphin and at last you know what you are and what you can expect from me, unless your intention is to punish me all my life for a sin I have already more than paid for.

"J'y courus. La pauvre petite sœur attendait à la porte; je lui dis d'avancer: elle le fit en tremblant, elle avait les yeux baissés; elle tenait un long morceau de mousseline attaché sur un patron qui lui échappa des mains au premier pas; je le ramassai; je la pris par un bras et la conduisis à la supérieure. Elle se jeta à genoux; elle saisit une de ses mains, qu'elle baisa en poussant quelques soupirs, et en versant une larme; puis elle s'empara d'une des miennes, qu'elle joignit à celle de la supérieure, et les baisa l'une et l'autre. La supérieure lui fit signe de se lever et de se placer où elle voudrait; elle obéit. On servit une collation. La supérieure se leva; elle ne s'assit point avec nous, mais elle se promenait autour de la table, posant sa main sur la tête de l'une, la renversant doucement en arrière et lui baisant le front, levant le linge de cou à une autre, plaçant sa main dessus, et demeurant appuyée sur le dos de son fauteuil; passant à une troisième, et laissant aller sur elle une de ses mains, ou la plaçant sur sa bouche; goûtant du bout des lèvres aux choses qu'on avait servies, et les distribuant à celle-ci, à celle-là. Après avoir circulé ainsi un moment, elle s'arrêta en face de moi, me regardant avec des yeux très-affectueux et très-tendres; cependant les autres les avaient baissés, comme si elles eussent craint de la contraindre ou de la distraire, mais surtout la sœur Sainte-Thérèse. La collation faite, je me mis au clavecin; et j'accompagnai deux sœurs qui chantèrent sans méthode, avec du goût, de la justesse et de la voix. Je chantai aussi, et je m'accompagnai. La supérieure était assise au pied du clavecin, et paraissait goûter le plus grand plaisir à m'entendre et à me voir; les autres écoutaient debout sans rien faire, ou s'étaient remises à l'ouvrage. Cette soirée fut délicieuse. Cela fait, toutes se retirèrent.","I ran there. The poor little sister was waiting at the door; I told her to come forward: she did so trembling, her eyes were lowered; she was holding a long piece of muslin tied to a pattern which slipped out of her hands at the first step; I picked it up; I took her by the arm and led her to the superior. She threw herself on her knees; she seized one of his hands, which she kissed, heaving a few sighs, and shedding a tear; then she seized one of mine, joined it to that of the Superior, and kissed them both. The Superior made a sign to her to get up and take a seat where she wanted; she obeys. A snack was served. The Superior rose; she did not sit with us, but she walked around the table, putting her hand on the head of one, gently tilting her back and kissing her forehead, lifting the neckerchief to another, placing her hand on it, and remaining leaning on the back of her chair; passing to a third, and letting one of his hands go over her, or placing it over his mouth; tasting with the tips of his lips the things that had been served, and distributing them to this one, to that one. After having circulated thus for a moment, she stopped in front of me, looking at me with very affectionate and very tender eyes; however, the others had lowered them, as if they were afraid of constraining or distracting her, but especially Sister Sainte-Thérèse. The collation done, I sat down to the harpsichord; and I accompanied two sisters who sang without method, with taste, accuracy and voice. I also sang, and accompanied myself. The Superior was seated at the foot of the harpsichord, and seemed to enjoy the greatest pleasure in hearing and seeing me; the others listened standing up without doing anything, or had resumed their work. This evening was delightful. This done, they all withdrew.","I ran to tell her. The poor little sister was waiting at the door. I told her to come in; she did so, trembling. Her eyes were downcast; she was carrying a long piece of muslin pinned to a pattern, which slipped out of her hands as soon as she stepped forward. I picked it up for her, took her by the arm, and led her over to the Mother Superior. She fell to her knees, seized one of the Mother Superior’s hands, kissed it, sighing and shedding a tear, and then took hold of one of my hands, which she joined with the Mother Superior’s, and kissed them both. The Mother Superior gestured to her to get up and to sit wherever she wanted, which she did. Refreshments were served. The Mother Superior got up. She did not sit with us, but instead walked around the table, placing her hand on one nun’s head, gently tilting it backwards and kissing her on the forehead; lifting up another nun’s gimp, placing her hand underneath it and leaning against the back of her chair; walking past another nun and as she did so letting one of her hands stray over her or touch her mouth; and nibbling some of the food that had been served and then offering it to this nun or that. Having circulated like that for a little while, she stopped in front of me and looked at me very affectionately and tenderly, and as she did so the other nuns, and particularly Sister Sainte Thérèse, lowered their eyes as if they were afraid of holding her back or distracting her. After the refreshments, I sat at the harpsichord and accompanied two sisters who sang in their untrained way, but with taste, accurately, and with good voices. I also sang and played myself. The Mother Superior sat by the harpsichord and seemed to take enormous pleasure in listening to me and watching me. The others listened to me as they stood around doing nothing, or they got on with their needlework again. That evening was delightful. When it was over, all the nuns left.","I ran off. The poor little thing was waiting outside the door. I told her to go in, which she did, trembling and with downcast eyes. A long piece of muslin with a pattern pinned to it dropped out of her hand at the first step she took; I picked it up, took her by the arm and led her over to the Superior. She fell on her knees, took one of the Superior’s hands and kissed it, sighing and weeping, then she took one of mine, joined it to the Superior’s, and kissed them both. The Superior signed her to get up and go where she liked, and she did so. Some refreshments were served. The Superior rose. She did not sit down with us, but walked round the table, putting her hand on somebody’s head and tipping it gently backwards and kissing her on the forehead, pulling up another one’s collar and letting her hand linger while pausing to lean against the back of the chair, going on to a third and letting her hand stray over her or putting it on to her mouth, and she only tasted with her lips the things that had been served and passed them on to one or another. Having wandered round a while she stopped opposite me and looked at me with great tenderness and affection, but the others kept their eyes lowered as if afraid of inhibiting or distracting her, and especially Sister Sainte-Thérèse. When refreshments were over I sat down at the keyboard and accompanied two sisters who sang in an untrained way, but with taste, correctly and with good voices. I sang too and accompanied myself. The Superior was seated at the end of the instrument and seemed to take the greatest pleasure in listening and watching me. The rest just stood round listening or took up their work again. It was a delightful evening. Then everybody left."

"L'inquiétude commençait à s'emparer de la supérieure; elle perdait sa gaieté, son embonpoint, son repos. La nuit suivante, lorsque tout le monde dormait et que la maison était dans le silence, elle se leva; après avoir erré quelque temps dans les corridors, elle vint à ma cellule. J'ai le sommeil léger, je crus la reconnaître. Elle s'arrêta. En s'appuyant le front apparemment contre ma porte, elle fit assez de bruit pour me réveiller, si j'avais dormi. Je gardai le silence; il me sembla que j'entendais une voix qui se plaignait, quelqu'un qui soupirait: j'eus d'abord un léger frisson, ensuite je me déterminai à dire Ave. Au lieu de me répondre, on s'éloignait à pas léger. On revint quelque temps après; les plaintes et les soupirs recommencèrent; je dis encore Ave, et l'on s'éloigna pour la seconde fois. Je me rassurai, et je m'endormis. Pendant que je dormais, on entra, on s'assit à côté de mon lit; mes rideaux étaient entr'ouverts; on tenait une petite bougie dont la lumière m'éclairait le visage, et celle qui la portait me regardait dormir; ce fut du moins ce que j'en jugeai à son attitude, lorsque j'ouvris les yeux; et cette personne, c'était la supérieure.","Worry was beginning to take hold of the Superior; she lost her gaiety, her plumpness, her repose. The following night, when everyone was asleep and the house was silent, she got up; after wandering the corridors for some time, she came to my cell. I'm a light sleeper, I thought I recognized her. She stopped. Leaning her forehead apparently against my door, she made enough noise to wake me, if I had been sleeping. I kept silent; it seemed to me that I heard a voice complaining, someone sighing: at first I had a slight shiver, then I determined to say Ave. Instead of answering me, they walked away with light steps. We returned some time later; complaints and sighs began again; I said Ave again, and they walked away for the second time. I reassured myself, and fell asleep. While I was sleeping, we came in, we sat down next to my bed; my curtains were ajar; a small candle was held, the light of which illuminated my face, and the one who carried it watched me sleeping; at least that was what I judged from his attitude when I opened my eyes; and that person was the superior.","Anxiety began to take hold of the Mother Superior. She lost her cheerfulness, her fullness of figure, and her peace of mind. The next night, when everyone was asleep and the convent was silent, she got up. After wandering along the corridors for a while, she came to my cell. I sleep lightly, and I thought I recognized her. She stopped. She seemed to be pressing her forehead against my door in order to make enough noise to wake me up, if I had been asleep. I remained silent. I thought I could hear a plaintive voice, somebody sighing. At first I trembled slightly, then I decided to say Ave; * but instead of replying, whoever was there tiptoed away. She came back a little while later. The moans and the sighs started again. I said Ave again, and again she went away. I composed myself and fell asleep. While I was asleep, someone came in and sat down by my bed. My curtains were half open, and the light from the little candle she was holding lit up my face, and the woman who was holding it watched me sleeping, or at least this is what I surmised when I opened my eyes and saw her there. It was the Mother Superior. I sat up with a start.","The Superior began to give way to resdessness and she lost her gaiety, freshness and sleep. On the following night, when everybody was asleep and the whole house silent, she rose and wandered about the corridors for some time, finally coming to my cell. I am a light sleeper, and I thought I recognized her step. She stopped still. Apparendy letting her head fall forward against my door she made enough noise to wake me even if I had been asleep. I made not a sound; I thought I heard a voice lamenting, somebody sighing, and it made me shudder, and then I made up my mind to say Ave. Instead of answering she tiptoed away, but came back a little later, and the moanings and sighings began again. Once again I cried Ave, and she went away a second time. I felt reassured and went to sleep. While I was asleep somebody came in and sat by my bed, the curtains were drawn aside and a little candle was held so as to light up my face while the person holding it watched me sleeping. Anyhow, that is what I gathered from her attitude when I opened my eyes, and the person was the Mother Superior."

We’re by ourselves here. These are my friends, and they’ll be yours too.

"«Mademoiselle, l'énigme de la conduite sévère de vos parents va s'expliquer pour vous; j'en ai obtenu la permission de madame votre mère. Vous êtes sage; vous avez de l'esprit, de la fermeté; vous êtes dans un âge où l'on pourrait vous confier un secret, même qui ne vous concernerait point. Il y a longtemps que j'ai exhorté pour la première fois madame votre mère à vous révéler celui que vous allez apprendre; elle n'a jamais pu s'y résoudre: il est dur pour une mère d'avouer une faute grave à son enfant; vous connaissez son caractère; il ne va guère avec la sorte d'humiliation d'un certain aveu. Elle a cru pouvoir sans cette ressource vous amener à ses desseins; elle s'est trompée; elle en est fâchée: elle revient aujourd'hui à mon conseil; et c'est elle qui m'a chargé de vous annoncer que vous n'étiez pas la fille de M. Simonin.»","“Mademoiselle, the enigma of your parents' severe conduct will be explained to you; I have obtained your mother's permission. You are wise; you have spirit, firmness; you are at an age when you could be confided in a secret, even if it does not concern you. It is long since I first urged your mother to reveal to you the one you are about to learn; she could never bring herself to do it: it is hard for a mother to admit a serious fault to her child; you know his character; it hardly goes with the sort of humiliation of a certain confession. She thought she could, without this resource, lead you to her designs; she was wrong; she is angry about it: she returns today to my advice; and it was she who asked me to tell you that you were not M. Simonin's daughter.”","‘Mademoiselle, I’m going to explain to you the mystery surrounding your parents’ harsh treatment of you; your mother has given me permission to do so. You’re sensible, intelligent, and resilient. You’re at an age where you can keep a secret, even one which doesn’t concern you. A long time ago I first urged your mother to tell you what you’re about to learn, but she was never able to bring herself to do so. It’s hard for a mother to confess a grave fault to her child. You know what she’s like: she’s not the sort to be able to face the humiliation of making such a confession. She thought that she could make you do what she wanted without having to resort to this measure. She was wrong, and this has angered her. Today she has accepted my advice, and she has asked me to tell you that you’re not the daughter of Monsieur Simonin.’","‘Mademoiselle, you are going to hear the explanation of your parents’ harsh behaviour. I have had your mother’s permission. You are sensible, you are intelligent and have reached an age when you could be trusted with a secret even if it didn’t concern yourself. A long while ago I first urged your mother to reveal the secret you are about to learn, but she could never make up her mind to do so. It is hard for a mother to confess a grievous sin to her own child; you know what her character is, and it is scarcely of a kind to accept the sort of humiliation a certain admission brings. She thought she could guide you to what she planned without having to do this, but she was mistaken, and is mortified about it. So now she has come round to my advice and she herself has asked me to tell you that you are not Monsieur Simonin’s child.’"
"—Madame, dis-je à la supérieure, en me levant de sur ses genoux où j'étais restée, accordez à ma sœur ce qu'elle vous demande; ne laissez pas durer sa peine; je vais me retirer; j'aurai toujours le temps de satisfaire l'intérêt que vous voulez bien prendre à moi; et quand vous aurez entendu ma sœur Thérèse, elle ne souffrira plus...»","“Madame,” I said to the superior, rising from her knees where I had remained, “grant my sister what she asks of you; do not let his pain last; I will retire; I will always have time to satisfy the interest you want to take in me; and when you have heard my sister Thérèse, she will suffer no more...»","‘Madame,’ I said, getting up from the Mother Superior’s knee, where I had remained throughout, ‘grant my sister’s request and put an end to her suffering; I shall withdraw now. There’s still plenty of time for me to satisfy the interest that you’re kindly taking in me. And when you’ve heard my sister Thérèse, she’ll no longer be suffering.’","‘Madame,’ I said, getting up from the Superior’s knee, where I still was, ‘grant Sister what she is asking. Don’t let her distress go on any longer. I am going now, and I shall always have time to satisfy the interest you are good enough to take in me, and when you have heard Sister Thérèse she won’t suffer any more…’"

"Cependant, mon procès se suivait avec chaleur: une foule de personnes de tout état, de tout sexe, de toutes conditions, que je ne connaissais pas, s'intéressèrent à mon sort et sollicitèrent pour moi. Vous fûtes de ce nombre, et peut-être l'histoire de mon procès vous est-elle mieux connue qu'à moi; car, sur la fin, je ne pouvais plus conférer avec M. Manouri. On lui dit que j'étais malade; il se douta qu'on le trompait; il trembla qu'on ne m'eût jetée dans le cachot. Il s'adressa à l'archevêché, où l'on ne daigna pas l'écouter; on y était prévenu que j'étais folle, ou peut-être quelque chose de pis. Il se retourna du côté des juges; il insista sur l'exécution de l'ordre signifié à la supérieure de me représenter, morte ou vive, quand elle en serait sommée. Les juges séculiers entreprirent les juges ecclésiastiques; ceux-ci sentirent les conséquences que cet incident pouvait avoir, si on n'allait au-devant; et ce fut là ce qui accéléra apparemment la visite du grand vicaire; car ces messieurs, fatigués des tracasseries éternelles de couvent, ne se pressent pas communément de s'en mêler: ils savent, par expérience, que leur autorité est toujours éludée et compromise.","However, my trial followed with warmth: a crowd of people of all states, of all sexes, of all conditions, whom I did not know, took an interest in my fate and solicited for me. You were of this number, and perhaps the story of my trial is better known to you than to me; for, at the end, I could no longer confer with M. Manouri. They told him that I was ill; he suspected that he was deceived; he trembled lest I should have been thrown into the dungeon. He addressed himself to the archdiocese, where they did not deign to listen to him; it was warned that I was mad, or perhaps something worse. He turned to the side of the judges; he insisted on carrying out the order given to the superior to represent me, dead or alive, when she was summoned to do so. The secular judges undertook the ecclesiastical judges; they felt the consequences that this incident could have, if we did not go ahead; and this was what apparently hastened the vicar general's visit; for these gentlemen, tired of the eternal annoyances of the convent, do not usually hurry to get involved in it: they know, by experience, that their authority is always eluded and compromised.","A host of people from all walks of life, of both sexes and of all callings, none of whom I knew, took an interest in my fate and intervened on my behalf. One of them was you, and perhaps you know the story of my case better than I do, since towards the end I was no longer allowed to speak with Monsieur Manouri, who was told that I was ill. He suspected that he was being deceived, and he feared that I had been thrown into the dungeon. He contacted the Archbishop’s palace but was not given so much as a hearing, for they had already been told that I was mad or perhaps worse. He went back to the judges and insisted that the directive given to the Mother Superior be enforced, which required her to have me appear dead or alive whenever she was called upon to do so. The civil judges broached the question with the ecclesiastical judges, who were well aware of the consequences that this incident could have if they did not proceed as necessary, and this seems to have ensured the prompt visit of the Vicar General, since men like him, weary of the endless squabbles in convents, are usually in no hurry to get involved in them, for experience tells them that their authority is always evaded and undermined.","Meanwhile my case was causing considerable excitement, a crowd of people of all walks of life, both sexes and all callings, and quite unknown to me, took an interest in my fate and intervened on my behalf. You were among them, and perhaps the story of my case is better known to you than to me, because towards the end I could no longer confer with Monsieur Manouri. He was told that I was ill , he suspected he was being deceived and he was afraid I had been thrown into that dungeon again. He went to the Archbishop’s palace where they did not deign to listen to him, for they had been warned that I was mad and probably something worse. He went back to the judges and insisted upon the carrying out of the order given to the Superior to produce me alive or dead whenever she was required to do so. The civil judges broached the matter with the ecclesiastical judges, who realized the consequences non-compliance with this order might have, and apparently it was this that hastened the visitation by the Vicar-General, for these personages, sick and tired of the endless squabbles in convents, are not usually in a great hurry to get involved in them. They know from experience that their authority is always evaded or whittled down."
"Je la suivis. En un moment elle eut ouvert le clavecin, préparé un livre, approché une chaise; car elle était vive. Je m'assis. Elle pensa que je pourrais avoir froid; elle détacha de dessus les chaises un coussin qu'elle posa devant moi, se baissa et me prit les deux pieds, qu'elle mit dessus; ensuite je jouai quelques pièces de Couperin, de Rameau, de Scarlatti: cependant elle avait levé un coin de mon linge de cou, sa main était placée sur mon épaule nue, et l'extrémité de ses doigts posée sur ma gorge. Elle soupirait; elle paraissait oppressée, son haleine s'embarrassait; la main qu'elle tenait sur mon épaule d'abord la pressait fortement, puis elle ne la pressait plus du tout, comme si elle eût été sans force et sans vie; et sa tête tombait sur la mienne. En vérité cette folle-là était d'une sensibilité incroyable, et avait le goût le plus vif pour la musique; je n'ai jamais connu personne sur qui elle eût produit des effets aussi singuliers.","I followed her. In a moment she had opened the harpsichord, prepared a book, drawn up a chair; because she was alive. I sat down. She thought I might be cold; she untied a cushion from above the chairs, which she placed in front of me, bent down and took my two feet, which she put on it; then I played a few pieces by Couperin, Rameau, Scarlatti: however she had lifted a corner of my neckerchief, her hand was placed on my bare shoulder, and the tips of her fingers rested on my throat. She sighed; she seemed oppressed, her breath was embarrassed; the hand she held on my shoulder at first pressed it strongly, then it no longer pressed it at all, as if it had been without strength and without life; and his head fell on mine. In truth, that madwoman was incredibly sensitive, and had the keenest taste for music; I have never known anyone on whom it would have produced such singular effects.","I followed her in. In an instant she had opened the harpsichord, produced a book, and pulled up a chair, for she moved briskly. I sat down. She thought I might be cold, so she took a cushion from one of the chairs and placed it in front of me, then bent down, took my feet and placed them on the cushion; then she went and stood behind my chair and leant against it. At first I played some chords, then I played some pieces by Couperin, Rameau, and Scarlatti. * While I was playing, she had lifted up a corner of my gimp,* her hand was now resting on my bare shoulder and the ends of her fingers were touching my breast. She sighed, it was as if she felt oppressed, she had difficulty breathing. The hand she had placed on my shoulder at first held me tightly, then not at all, as if all strength and life had drained from her, and her head fell against mine. In truth, though mad, she was extremely sensitive and had the keenest interest in music. I have never known anybody on whom music has had such an extraordinary effect.","I followed her in. In an instant she had opened the keyboard, produced a book, moved up a chair, for she was quick in her movements. I sat down. Thinking I might be chilly she removed a cushion from the chairs, which she put in front of me and bent down, took my feet and placed them on the cushion. Then I played some pieces of Coup-erin, Rameau and Scarlatti, during which she lifted a corner of my collar and rested her hand on my bare shoulder, with the tips of her fingers touching my breast. She was sighing and seemed oppressed, breathing heavily. The hand on my shoulder pressed hard at first but then ceased pressing at all, as though all strength and life had gone out of her and her head fell on to mine. Truly that hare-brained woman was incredibly sensitive and had the most exquisite taste for music, for I have never known anybody on whom it had such an extraordinary effect."

She examined the blankets... ‘They are fine.’ She picked up the bolster and, plumping it up, said: ‘This sweet head of yours will be quite comfortable on this... These sheets aren’t soft, but they’re all we have in our convent... This mattress is good...’ Having done that, she comes over to me, kisses me, and then leaves.

Pour n'être pas interrompue dans cette occupation, j'attendis que tout le monde fût à l'office: j'ouvris l'oratoire, j'abattis la planche et je trouvai un rouleau de papiers assez considérable que je brûlai dès le soir.

I cannot paint you my pain; however, I envied his fate.

So as not to be interrupted in this occupation, I waited until everyone was at the office: I opened the oratory, I knocked down the board and I found a rather large roll of papers which I burned from the evening .

"Pendant des mois entiers que cette maladie dura, le reste de la communauté eut le temps de pâtir et de me prendre en aversion. Je ne reviendrai pas sur les désagréments d'une religieuse qu'on hait dans sa maison, vous en devez être instruit à présent. Je sentis peu à peu renaître le dégoût de mon état. Je portai ce dégoût et mes peines dans le sein du nouveau directeur; il s'appelle dom Morel; c'est un homme d'un caractère ardent; il touche à la quarantaine. Il parut m'écouter avec attention et avec intérêt; il désira de connaître les événements de ma vie; il me fit entrer dans les détails les plus minutieux sur ma famille, sur mes penchants, mon caractère, les maisons où j'avais été, celle où j'étais, sur ce qui s'était passé entre ma supérieure et moi. Je ne lui cachai rien. Il ne me parut pas mettre à la conduite de la supérieure avec moi la même importance que le P. Lemoine; à peine daigna-t-il me jeter là-dessus quelques mots; il regarda cette affaire comme finie; la chose qui le touchait le plus, c'étaient mes dispositions secrètes sur la vie religieuse. À mesure que je m'ouvrais, sa confiance faisait les mêmes progrès; si je me confessais à lui, il se confiait à moi; ce qu'il me disait de ses peines avait la plus parfaite conformité avec les miennes; il était entré en religion malgré lui; il supportait son état avec le même dégoût, et il n'était guère moins à plaindre que moi.","During the whole months that this illness lasted, the rest of the community had time to suffer and take a dislike to me. I won't go back over the inconveniences of a hated nun in her house, you must be aware of that by now. Little by little I felt my disgust at my condition reborn. I carried this disgust and my sorrows to the bosom of the new director; his name is Dom Morel; he is a man of ardent character; he is in his forties. He seemed to listen to me with attention and interest; he wanted to know the events of my life; he made me go into the most minute details about my family, about my inclinations, my character, the houses where I had been, the one where I was, about what had passed between my superior and me. I hid nothing from him. He did not seem to me to attach the same importance to the conduct of the Superior with me as Father Lemoine; he scarcely condescended to throw a few words at me; he considered this affair as finished; the thing that touched him the most was my secret disposition to religious life. As I opened up, his confidence made the same progress; if I confessed to him, he confided in me; what he said to me about his sorrows had the most perfect conformity with mine; he had entered religion in spite of himself; he bore his condition with the same disgust, and he was hardly less to be pitied than I was.","As the months passed and this illness continued, the rest of the community had plenty of time to suffer and to turn against me. I shall not dwell again on the difficulties endured by a nun who is hated in her convent, for you should know all about that by now. Gradually I felt my revulsion for my condition coming back. I confided in the new confessor about this revulsion and my suffering. His name is Dom Morel. * He is a passionate man in his late thirties. He seemed to listen to me attentively and with interest. He wanted to know what had happened to me in my life. He made me go into great detail about my family, my tastes, my character, the convents I had been in, the one I was in now, and what had happened between the Mother Superior and me. I told him everything. He did not seem to attach the same importance to the Mother Superior’s conduct towards me as Father Lemoine had. He said very little about it to me, and he regarded the matter as closed. What he was most interested in was what I secretly felt about the religious life. The more I opened up to him, the more he trusted me. If I confessed things to him, he confessed things to me. What he told me about his suffering corresponded precisely to mine. He had entered the religious life against his will, he endured his condition with the same revulsion as I did, and he was almost as much to be pitied as I was.","For months on end this illness went on, and the rest of the community had plenty of time to suffer from it and turn against me. I will not go once again into the unpleasantnesses undergone by a nun who is hated in her convent, you should know all about that by now. I gradually felt my distaste for my calling coming back. I confided this distaste and my troubles to the new confessor. His name is Dom Morel, a passionate man still under forty. He seemed to listen attentively and with great interest, he wanted to know the story of my life and made me go into the minutest details about my family, likes and dislikes, my character, the convents in which I had lived and the one where I now was, as well as what had passed between the Superior and myself. I kept nothing from him. He did not seem to attach the same importance as Father Lemoine to the behaviour of the Superior towards me, for he scarcely bothered to make more than a few remarks about that and treated the matter as closed, whereas what concerned him most was my innermost feelings about the religious life. As I opened out about this, his trust in me made similar progress, and if I confessed to him he confided in me about himself, and what he told me about his own troubles tallied exacdy with mine; he had entered the religious life against his will, had borne his situation with the same distaste, and was hardly less deserving of pity than I was."

"Mais une peine ne vient jamais seule. Le temps d'aller à confesse arriva. Je m'étais déjà accusée des premières caresses que ma supérieure m'avait faites; le directeur m'avait très-expressément défendu de m'y prêter davantage; mais le moyen de se refuser à des choses qui font grand plaisir à une autre dont on dépend entièrement, et auxquelles on n'entend soi-même aucun mal?","But a pain never comes alone.

"Son état m'effrayait. Je parlai à la supérieure. Je voulais qu'on la mît à l'infirmerie, qu'on la dispensât des offices et des autres exercices pénibles de la maison, qu'on appelât un médecin; mais on me répondit toujours que ce n'était rien, que ces défaillances se passeraient toutes seules; et la chère sœur Ursule ne demandait pas mieux que de satisfaire à ses devoirs et à suivre la vie commune. Un jour, après les matines, auxquelles elle avait assisté, elle ne parut point. Je pensai qu'elle était bien mal; l'office du matin fini, je volai chez elle, je la trouvai couchée sur son lit tout habillée; elle me dit: «Vous voilà, chère amie? Je me doutais que vous ne tarderiez pas à venir, et je vous attendais. Écoutez-moi. Que j'avais d'impatience que vous vinssiez! Ma défaillance a été si forte et si longue, que j'ai cru que j'y resterais et que je ne vous reverrais plus. Tenez, voilà la clef de mon oratoire, vous en ouvrirez l'armoire, vous enlèverez une petite planche qui sépare en deux parties le tiroir d'en bas; vous trouverez derrière cette planche un paquet de papiers; je n'ai jamais pu me résoudre à m'en séparer, quelque danger que je courusse à les garder, et quelque douleur que je ressentisse à les lire; hélas! ils sont presque effacés de mes larmes: quand je ne serai plus, vous les brûlerez...»","His condition frightened me. I spoke to the superior. I wanted her to be put in the infirmary, to be excused from offices and other painful exercises in the house, to be called a doctor; but I was always told that it was nothing, that these failings would pass by themselves; and dear Sister Ursule asked nothing better than to fulfill her duties and follow the common life. One day, after the matins she had attended, she did not appear. I thought she was very badly; the morning service finished, I flew to her house, I found her lying on her bed fully dressed; she said to me: “There you are, dear friend? I suspected that you would soon come, and I was expecting you. Listen to me. How impatient I was for you to come! My breakdown was so strong and so long that I thought I would stay there and never see you again. Here, here is the key to my oratory, you will open the cupboard, you will remove a small board which separates the lower drawer into two parts; you will find behind this board a bundle of papers; I could never make up my mind to part with them, whatever danger I ran in keeping them, and whatever pain I felt in reading them; Alas! they are almost erased by my tears: when I am no more, you will burn them...»","Her condition terrified me; I spoke to the Mother Superior. I wanted her to be moved to the infirmary and excused from the services and the other arduous duties in the convent, and I wanted a doctor to be called, but the reply always came that there was nothing wrong with her and that her fainting fits would pass of their own accord; and dear Sister Ursule wanted nothing more than to fulfil her duties and to participate in the communal life of the convent. One day, after matins, which she had attended, she failed to reappear. I thought she must be very ill. As soon as the morning office was over, I rushed to her room. I found her lying on her bed, fully dressed. She said to me: ‘Is that you, dear friend? I knew you’d come, and I was waiting for you. Listen. I couldn’t wait for you to come! I was so very feeble for so long that I thought I wouldn’t recover and that I’d never see you again. Here, this is the key to my oratory; go and open the cupboard, lift up the little plank of wood that divides the bottom drawer in two, and behind it you’ll find a bundle of papers; I could never bring myself to part with them, no matter how dangerous it was to keep them and how painful it was to read them: Alas! my tears have almost blotted out all the writing. When I’m gone, you must burn them.’","Her condition appalled me. I spoke to the Superior about it, for I wanted her to be moved into the infirmary and to be excused from chapel and the other irksome domestic duties. Also I wanted a doctor to be sent for, but the reply always was that it was nothing, that these attacks would pass off of their own accord, and that dear Sister Ursule was only too anxious to fulfil her obligations and follow the normal routine. One day, after Matins, which she had attended, she failed to reappear. I thought she must be very ill, and as soon as the morning services were over I rushed to her room and found her lying on her bed fully dressed. She said: ‘Oh, there you are, dear friend, I felt sure you would not be long and I was expecting you. Listen. How impatient I was for you to come! My attack was so bad and lasted so long that I thought I should never recover and should never see you again. Look, here is the key of my oratory; open the cupboard and remove a little partition which divides the lower drawer into two.

"Le matin, lorsque les religieuses vinrent au chœur, elles me trouvèrent à ma place; elles approchèrent toutes de la sainte table, et la supérieure à leur tête, ce qui acheva de me persuader son innocence, sans me détacher du parti que j'avais pris.

"Mon père était avocat. Il avait épousé ma mère dans un âge assez avancé; il en eut trois filles. Il avait plus de fortune qu'il n'en fallait pour les établir solidement; mais pour cela il fallait au moins que sa tendresse fût également partagée; et il s'en manque bien que j'en puisse faire cet éloge. Certainement je valais mieux que mes sœurs par les agréments de l'esprit et de la figure, le caractère et les talents; et il semblait que mes parents en fussent affligés.

He had more fortune than was necessary to establish them solidly; but for that it was necessary at least that his tenderness should be equally shared; and it is lacking in it, although I can praise it. Certainly I was better than my sisters in charms of mind and face, character and talents; and it seemed that my parents were afflicted by it. What nature and application had granted me advantages over them became for me a source of sorrow, in order to be loved, cherished, celebrated, always excused as they were, from my youngest years I wanted to be like them. If it happened that someone said to my mother: ""You have charming children..."" that never meant anything to me. I was sometimes well avenged for this injustice; but the praise I had received cost me so dear when we were alone, that I would have liked indifference or even insults as much; the more I liked foreigners, the more we were in a bad mood when they went out. O how many times I cried for not being born ugly, stupid, stupid, proud; in a word, with all the failings that succeeded in their dealings with our parents! I wondered where this oddity came from, in a father, a mother who was honest, just and pious. Shall I confess it to you, sir? A few speeches escaped my father in his anger, for he was violent; a few circumstances brought together at different intervals, words from neighbors, remarks from servants, made me suspect a reason which would somewhat excuse them. Perhaps my father had some uncertainty about my birth; perhaps I was reminding my mother of a fault she had committed, and of the ingratitude of a man she had listened to too much; what do I know? But if these suspicions were ill-founded, what would I risk in confiding them to you? You will burn this writing, and I promise to burn your answers.","My father was a lawyer. * He had married my mother quite late in life, and they had three daughters. He had more than enough money to provide for all three. But to have done that would have meant at least that he should love them equally, and that is the last thing I can give him credit for. I certainly outshone my sisters in terms of intellect, beauty, character, and ability, and this seemed to upset my parents. As both the gifts of nature and the fruits of hard work, which set me above my sisters, seemed only to create trouble, I decided at a very early age to try to be like them, in the hope of being loved, cherished, praised, and invariably excused as they were. If somebody happened to say to my mother: ‘Your children are charming...’, the comment was never taken to refer to me. On the rare occasion when this wrong was righted, the praise I received cost me so dear when she and I were alone that I would have been just as happy to have been met with indifference or even insults, for whenever visitors showed an interest in me, things would take a turn for the worse once they had left. Oh, how many times I wept because I was not born ugly, stupid, foolish, conceited–in a word, with all the disadvantages that earned my sisters the favour of our parents! I tried to find some explanation for this strange behaviour in a father and mother who were otherwise decent, fair, and pious. Shall I tell you what I think, Monsieur? Some words my father let slip in a fit of rage, for he was a violent man, certain incidents over the years, comments made by neighbours, and remarks by servants, all these made me suspect one reason which might go some way to excusing them. Perhaps my father had his doubts about my birth, perhaps I reminded my mother of an indiscretion she had committed and the ingratitude of a man whom she had trusted too much, how can I know? But even if these suspicions were unfounded, what would I be risking in telling you about them? You will burn this letter, and I promise to burn your replies.","My father was an advocate. He had married my mother rather late in life and they had three daughters. He had more than enough money to settle all three comfortably, but that supposed at any rate an equal share of love for them, and that is the last thing I can give him credit for. Certainly I surpassed my sisters in qualities of mind and beauty, character and ability, and this seemed to upset my parents. As my natural and acquired advantages over them only brought sorrow to me, I strove from my very earliest days to be like them in the hope of being loved, cherished, indulged and excused as they were. If anybody happened to say to my mother: ‘Your children are charming’, it was never taken as referring to me. Sometimes this wrong was more than righted, but such praises as I then received were so cruelly paid for when we were alone that I would just as soon have met indifference or even insults, for the more the visitors had shown preference for me the more unkindly was I treated when they had gone.

I wondered what could be the reason for this strange behaviour in a father and mother otherwise good, fair-minded and pious. Shall I tell you? Odd words let slip by my father when in a temper, for he was a choleric man, and certain happenings over the years – words dropped by neighbours, things said by servants – made me suspect a reason which might excuse them a little.

"Quelquefois je m'en retournais, et je passais la journée sans rien prendre; quelquefois j'insistais; et l'on me mettait sur le seuil des mets qu'on aurait eu honte de présenter à des animaux; je les ramassais en pleurant, et je m'en allais. Arrivais-je quelquefois à la porte du chœur la dernière, je la trouvais fermée; je m'y mettais à genoux; et là j'attendais la fin de l'office: si c'était au jardin, je m'en retournais dans ma cellule. Cependant, mes forces s'affaiblissant par le peu de nourriture, la mauvaise qualité de celle que je prenais, et plus encore par la peine que j'avais à supporter tant de marques réitérées d'inhumanité, je sentis que, si je persistais à souffrir sans me plaindre, je ne verrais jamais la fin de mon procès. Je me déterminai donc à parler à la supérieure; j'étais à moitié morte de frayeur: j'allai cependant frapper doucement à sa porte. Elle ouvrit; à ma vue, elle recula plusieurs pas en arrière, en me criant:","Sometimes I would go back and pass the day without taking anything; sometimes I insisted; and they put me on the threshold of the dishes which one would have been ashamed to present to animals; I picked them up crying and left. Sometimes I arrived at the door of the choir last, I found it closed; I knelt there; and there I waited for the end of the service: if it was in the garden, I went back to my cell. However, my strength weakening from the scarcity of food, the poor quality of that which I took, and still more from the pain I had to bear so many repeated marks of inhumanity, I felt that, if I persisted in suffer without complaining, I would never see the end of my trial. I therefore determined to speak to the superior; I was half dead with fright: however, I went and knocked softly at his door. She opened; at the sight of me, she took several steps back, crying out to me:","Sometimes I left and ate nothing the whole day. On other occasions I insisted, and food was left for me on the doorstep that one would have been ashamed to give to animals. I picked it up in tears and left. Whenever I arrived last at the door to the choir, I would find it shut, so I would kneel down and wait there for the office to end. But if it was the door to the garden, I would go back to my cell. However, with my strength being sapped by my eating so little and by the poor quality of the food I did eat, and also by how difficult I found it to endure so many repeated acts of inhumanity, I felt that if I persisted in suffering without complaining, then I would never see my lawsuit through to its conclusion. And so I resolved to speak to the Mother Superior. I was half dead with terror. I nevertheless went and knocked gently on her door, which she opened. As soon as she saw me she took several steps back and cried:","Sometimes I came away and went all day without anything, but sometimes I insisted, and then they put down on the doorstep food one would have been ashamed to set before animals. I picked it up in tears and went away. If I happened to arrive last at the door of the choir I found it shut, and there I knelt down and waited for the end of the service, but if it was the door to the garden I went back to my cell. But my strength was being sapped by the lack of food and the poor quality of the food I had, and even more by the struggle I was having to bear so many repeated acts of inhumanity, and I felt that if I persisted in suffering without complaint I should never live to see the end of my lawsuit. So I made up my mind to speak to the Superior. I was half dead with panic, but I went and tapped softly on her door. She opened it and on seeing me stepped back several paces and cried:"

"Vous savez, monsieur, que le jeudi l'on transporte le Saint-Sacrement de son tabernacle dans un reposoir particulier, où il reste jusqu'au vendredi matin. Cet intervalle est rempli par les adorations successives des religieuses, qui se rendent au reposoir les unes après les autres, ou deux à deux. Il y a un tableau qui indique à chacune son heure d'adoration; que je fus contente d'y lire: La sœur Sainte-Suzanne et la sœur Sainte-Ursule, depuis deux heures du matin jusqu'à trois! Je me rendis au reposoir à l'heure marquée; ma compagne y était. Nous nous plaçâmes l'une à côté de l'autre sur les marches de l'autel; nous nous prosternâmes ensemble, nous adorâmes Dieu pendant une demi-heure. Au bout de ce temps, ma jeune amie me tendit la main et me la serra en disant:","You know, sir, that on Thursdays the Blessed Sacrament is carried from its tabernacle to a private altar, where it remains until Friday morning.

There is a table which indicates to each one her hour of adoration; How happy I was to read there: Sister Sainte-Suzanne and Sister Sainte-Ursule, from two in the morning until three! I went to the altar at the appointed time; my girlfriend was there. We placed ourselves side by side on the altar steps; we prostrated ourselves together, we adored God for half an hour. At the end of this time, my young friend held out her hand to me and shook it, saying:","As you know, Monsieur, on Maundy Thursday the Blessed Sacrament is taken from its tabernacle to a special altar of repose, where it remains until Good Friday morning. Throughout that time the nuns take it in turns to kneel in adoration before the altar, either individually or in pairs. A notice indicates the time at which each nun is to make her adoration, and I was very happy to read that Sister Sainte Suzanne and Sister Sainte Ursule were to be together between two and three in the morning. I went to the altar at the allotted time, and my companion was already there. We took our places side by side on the altar steps, prostrated ourselves together, and adored God for half an hour.

"Je fus conduite à Longchamp; ce fut ma mère qui m'accompagna. Je ne demandai point à dire adieu à M. Simonin; j'avoue que la pensée ne m'en vint qu'en chemin. On m'attendait; j'étais annoncée, et par mon histoire et par mes talents: on ne me dit rien de l'une; mais on fut très-pressé de voir si l'acquisition qu'on faisait en valait la peine. Lorsqu'on se fut entretenu de beaucoup de choses indifférentes, car après ce qui m'était arrivé, vous pensez bien qu'on ne parla ni de Dieu, ni de vocation, ni des dangers du monde, ni de la douceur de la vie religieuse, et qu'on ne hasarda pas un mot des pieuses fadaises dont on remplit ces premiers moments, la supérieure dit: «Mademoiselle, vous savez la musique, vous chantez; nous avons un clavecin; si vous vouliez, nous irions dans notre parloir...» J'avais l'âme serrée, mais ce n'était pas le moment de marquer de la répugnance; ma mère passa, je la suivis; la supérieure ferma la marche avec quelques religieuses que la curiosité avait attirées. C'était le soir; on m'apporta des bougies; je m'assis, je me mis au clavecin; je préludai longtemps, cherchant un morceau de musique dans la tête, que j'en ai pleine, et n'en trouvant point; cependant la supérieure me pressa, et je chantai sans y entendre finesse, par habitude, parce que le morceau m'était familier: Tristes apprêts, pâles flambeaux, jour plus affreux que les ténèbres, etc.12 Je ne sais ce que cela produisit; mais on ne m'écouta pas longtemps: on m'interrompit par des éloges, que je fus bien surprise d'avoir mérités si promptement et à si peu de frais. Ma mère me remit entre les mains de la supérieure, me donna sa main à baiser, et s'en retourna.","I was taken to Longchamp; it was my mother who accompanied me. I did not ask to say goodbye to M. Simonin; I confess that the thought only came to me on the way. I was expected; I was announced, and by my story and by my talents: nothing is said to me of one; but they were in a great hurry to see if the acquisition they were making was worth the trouble. When we had talked about many indifferent things, because after what had happened to me, you can well imagine that we spoke neither of God, nor of vocation, nor of the dangers of the world, nor of the sweetness of life nun, and that no one ventured a word of the pious nonsense with which these first moments are filled, the superior said: “Mademoiselle, you know music, you sing; we have a harpsichord; if you wanted, we'd go to our parlor...' My soul was tight, but this was not the time to show repugnance; my mother passed, I followed her; the superior brought up the rear with a few nuns who had been attracted by curiosity. It was the evening; they brought me candles; I sat down, I took up the harpsichord; I preluded for a long time, looking for a piece of music in my head, which is full of it, and finding none; however, the Superior pressed me, and I sang without hearing finesse, out of habit, because the piece was familiar to me: Sad preparations, pale torches, day more dreadful than darkness, etc.12 I don't know what happened; but they did not listen to me for long: they interrupted me with eulogies, which I was very surprised to have deserved so promptly and at so little expense. My mother handed me over to the superior, gave me her hand to kiss, and went back.","I was taken to Longchamp, accompanied by my mother. I did not ask to say farewell to Monsieur Simonin, and I admit that the thought only occurred to me after we had left. They were expecting me: accounts both of my past and of my talents had gone before me. Nothing was said about the former, but there was a great deal of interest in finding out if this new acquisition was worth the effort. Once we had spoken about a lot of trivial things, since, after what had happened to me, you can rest assured that no reference was made to God, a vocation, the dangers of the world, or the comforts of the religious life, and not a word was uttered of the pious platitudes with which these first moments are usually filled, the Mother Superior said: ‘Mademoiselle, you can read music, you can sing. We have a harpsichord. If you’d like, we could go into our parlour...’ I felt a pang of anguish, but this was not the time to show my repugnance. My mother led the way, I followed her, and the Mother Superior brought up the rear with a few nuns who had come out of curiosity. It was evening, and candles were brought in for me. I sat down at the harpsichord and improvised for a long time, trying to remember one of the many pieces I knew by heart, though in vain. But the Mother Superior insisted, and so, without a second thought and out of habit, because I knew it well , I sang Sorrowful decorations, faint candles, a light more terrible than the darkness *... I do not know what effect it had, but they did not listen to it for long. I was interrupted by words of praise which I was very surprised to have earned so quickly and with so little effort. My mother handed me over to the Mother Superior, gave me her hand to kiss, and then left.","I was taken to Longchamp, and my mother came with me.

As Sainte Suzanne isn’t here anymore, I can go out without meeting her. Oh! But what if I did meet her! But she’s not here anymore, is she? She isn’t, is she?... Happy the convent that has her in it!... She’ll tell her new Mother Superior everything. What will she think of me?... Has Sainte Thérèse died? I heard the bell tolling for the dead all last night.

She really has gone? Happy the convent where she is! She will tell her new Superior everything; what will she think of me? Is Sainte-Thérèse dead? I heard the bell tolling all night. Poor girl, she is damned for all eternity, and it is my fault, my fault! One day I shall meet her face to face and what shall I say? What answer shall I make? Alas for her! Alas for me!’"
"Je ne sais ce que nous dîmes encore, lorsqu'on vint l'avertir qu'on la demandait au parloir.

"Deux figures inconnues se présentèrent à moi; c'étaient une religieuse et la tourière d'Arpajon: elles m'instruisirent en un mot du sujet de leur visite.

"Je revins sur ce qu'elle m'avait dit; je demandai à Dieu de m'éclairer; je réfléchis et je conclus, tout bien considéré, que quoique des personnes fussent d'un même sexe, il pouvait y avoir du moins de l'indécence dans la manière dont elles se témoignaient leur amitié; que le P.

"Le lendemain elle entra de bonne heure dans ma cellule; je ne l'entendis point; je n'étais pas encore éveillée.

"—Et lorsqu'on vient à les perdre en y réfléchissant, car ces vapeurs salutaires, que le cœur envoie vers la raison, sont par intervalles dissipées, alors on voit toute la profondeur de sa misère; on se déteste soi-même; on déteste les autres; on pleure, on gémit, on crie, on sent les approches du désespoir. Alors les unes courent se jeter aux genoux de leur supérieure, et vont y chercher de la consolation; d'autres se prosternent ou dans leur cellule ou au pied des autels, et appellent le ciel à leur secours; d'autres déchirent leurs vêtements et s'arrachent les cheveux; d'autres cherchent un puits profond, des fenêtres bien hautes, un lacet, et le trouvent quelquefois; d'autres, après s'être tourmentées longtemps, tombent dans une espèce d'abrutissement et restent imbéciles; d'autres, qui ont des organes faibles et délicats, se consument de langueur; il y en a en qui l'organisation se trouble et qui deviennent furieuses. Les plus heureuses sont celles en qui les mêmes illusions consolantes renaissent et les bercent presque jusqu'au tombeau; leur vie se passe dans les alternatives de l'erreur et du désespoir.","—And when we come to lose them by reflecting on them, for these salutary vapors, which the heart sends towards reason, are at intervals dissipated, then we see the full depth of its misery; we hate ourselves; one hates others; we cry, we groan, we cry, we feel the approach of despair. Then some run to throw themselves at the knees of their superior, and go there to seek consolation; others prostrate themselves either in their cell or at the foot of the altars, and call on heaven for help; others tear their clothes and tear their hair; others look for a deep well, very high windows, a lace, and sometimes find it; others, after tormenting themselves for a long time, fall into a kind of stupefaction and remain imbeciles; others, who have weak and delicate organs, are consumed with languor; there are those in whom the organization becomes disturbed and who become furious. The happiest are those in whom the same consoling illusions are reborn and rock them almost to the grave; their life passes in the alternations of error and despair.","‘But when thinking about them destroys them, because these salutary vapours with which the heart shrouds reason are dispelled from time to time, it’s at that point that they realize the true depth of their misery. They hate themselves and they hate other people. They weep, wail, and howl; they feel the onset of despair. Then some of them go and throw themselves at their Mother Superior’s knees and seek solace; others prostrate themselves in their cells or before the altar and cry out to heaven for help; others rip off their clothes and tear out their hair; others look for a deep well, a very high window, or a length of rope, and sometimes they find it; others, who’ve been anxious for a long time, sink into a kind of daze and remain numb; others, with weak and delicate organs, waste away in languor; and there are yet others whose constitution is upset, whose minds are disturbed, and who go raving mad. The luckiest ones are those in whom the same consoling illusions keep recurring and who can nurture them almost until death: they spend their lives in a mixture of error and despair.’","‘And when they lose them, for these healing mists which the heart throws round reason are sometimes blown away, then they see the full depth of their misery, they loathe themselves and others, they weep, moan, howl and feel despair overtaking them. Some rush and throw themselves at their Superior’s feet and seek consolation, others bow down in their cells or before the altar and call on Heaven for succour, others rend their garments and tear their hair, others look for a deep well, high windows, a rope to hang themselves, and sometimes find what they want. Others, after long fretting, fall into a kind of apathy and become imbeciles for life, others, of frail and delicate constitution, fade away in languor, but there are yet others whose nervous systems break down and they go raving mad. The most fortunate are those in whom the same consoling illusions are ever being reborn and go on lulling them almost to the grave; their lives go by in successive phases of self-deception and despair.’"

"J'avais pris de l'humidité; j'étais dans une circonstance critique; j'avais tout le corps meurtri; depuis plusieurs jours je n'avais pris que quelques gouttes d'eau avec un peu de pain. Je crus que cette persécution serait la dernière que j'aurais à souffrir. C'est par l'effet momentané de ces secousses violentes qui montrent combien la nature a de force dans les jeunes personnes, que je revins en très-peu de temps; et je trouvai, quand je reparus, toute la communauté persuadée que j'avais été malade. Je repris les exercices de la maison et ma place à l'église. Je n'avais pas oublié mon papier, ni la jeune sœur à qui je l'avais confié; j'étais sûre qu'elle n'avait point abusé de ce dépôt, mais qu'elle ne l'avait pas gardé sans inquiétude. Quelques jours après ma sortie de prison, au chœur, au moment même où je le lui avais donné, c'est-à-dire lorsque nous nous mettons à genoux et qu'inclinées les unes vers les autres nous disparaissons dans nos stalles, je me sentis tirer doucement par ma robe; je tendis la main, et l'on me donna un billet qui ne contenait que ces mots: «Combien vous m'avez inquiétée! Et ce cruel papier, que faut-il que j'en fasse?...» Après avoir lu celui-ci, je le roulai dans mes mains, et je l'avalai. Tout cela se passait au commencement du carême. Le temps approchait où la curiosité d'entendre appelle à Longchamp la bonne et la mauvaise compagnie de Paris. J'avais la voix très-belle; j'en avais peu perdu. C'est dans les maisons religieuses qu'on est attentif aux plus petits intérêts; on eut quelques ménagements pour moi; je jouis d'un peu plus de liberté; les sœurs que j'instruisais au chant purent approcher de moi sans conséquence; celle à qui j'avais confié mon mémoire en était une. Dans les heures de récréation que nous passions au jardin, je la prenais à l'écart, je la faisais chanter; et pendant qu'elle chantait, voici ce que je lui dis:","I had taken on moisture; I was in a critical circumstance; my whole body was bruised; for several days I had only taken a few drops of water with a little bread. I believed that this persecution would be the last I would have to suffer. It was by the momentary effect of those violent shocks which show how much strength nature has in young persons, that I returned in a very short time; and I found, when I reappeared, the whole community persuaded that I had been ill. I resumed the exercises at home and my place in the church. I had not forgotten my paper, nor the young sister to whom I had entrusted it; I was sure that she had not abused this deposit, but that she had not kept it without anxiety. A few days after my release from prison, in the choir, at the very moment when I had given it to him, that is to say when we kneel down and bow down towards each other and disappear into our stalls, I felt myself tug gently by my dress; I stretched out my hand, and I was given a note which contained only these words: “How much you worried me! And this cruel paper, what am I to do with it?...” After reading this one, I rolled it up in my hands and swallowed it. All this happened at the beginning of Lent. The time was approaching when the curiosity to hear calls to Longchamp the good and the bad company of Paris. I had a very beautiful voice; I had lost little. It is in religious houses that attention is paid to the smallest interests; some consideration was given to me; I enjoy a little more freedom; the sisters whom I instructed in singing were able to approach me without consequence; the one to whom I had entrusted my dissertation was one. During the hours of recreation that we spent in the garden, I took her aside, I made her sing; and while she was singing, this is what I said to her:","I was in a critical condition. My body was covered in bruises, for several days all I had had was a few drops of water and a little bread, and I thought that this persecution would be the last trial I would ever face. But the effect of these violent upsets was short lived, which shows how strong nature is in young women. I recovered very quickly, and I found, when I reappeared, that the rest of the community had been given to believe that I had been ill. I took up my duties again in the convent and my place in the church. I had not forgotten about my statement, nor about the young sister to whom I had entrusted it. I was convinced that she would not have abused this trust, but also that looking after it would have caused her some disquiet. A few days after my release from prison, in the choir, at precisely the point in the service when I had first handed it to her, that is to say, when we kneel down and bow our heads, disappearing in our stalls, I felt a gentle pull on my dress, I held out my hand and was given a note which read simply: ‘I have been so worried about you! And what I am supposed to do with your cruel papers?’ Once I had read her note, I screwed it up and swallowed it. All this happened at the start of Lent. The time was approaching when the desire to listen to the music at Longchamp brings in all the people of Paris, good and bad alike. I had a very fine voice which had hardly deteriorated. Convents are keen to foster all interests, however small. I was treated rather considerately, enjoying a little more freedom than the others, and the sisters to whom I gave singing lessons could approach me without any repercussions. I had entrusted my statement to one of these sisters. During the free time we had in the garden, I took her to one side and made her sing, and while she was singing, I said:","My body was covered with bruises and for several days I had only had a few drops of water and a little bread. I thought that would be the last persecution I would have to suffer. Thanks to the very short-lived effects of violent upheavals which prove how resilient nature is in the young, I recovered in no time, and when I reappeared it was to find the whole community convinced that I had been ill. I took up my domestic duties again and my place in church. I had not forgotten my document, nor the young sister to whom I had entrusted it, and I was sure that she had not misused what I had given her, but that she would not have kept it without misgivings. A few days after my release from prison, in choir at the very point in the service when I had given it to her – that is, when we kneel down and bow to those opposite, disappearing in our stalls – I felt my dress being gently pulled, held out my hand and she slipped me a note containing only these words: ‘What a worry you have been to me! What am I to do with that dreadful paper?’ After reading it I screwed the note up in my fingers and swallowed it. All this happened at the beginning of Lent and the time was approaching when interest in hearing the music draws to Longchamp the whole of Paris society, good and bad alike. I had a very good voice, and it had not deteriorated very much. In religious houses they pay attention to anything profitable, however small, so I was treated kindly in various ways, enjoyed a little more freedom, and the sisters I taught singing could risk contact with me. The sister to whom I had entrusted my document was one of these. During recreation time when we were in the garden I took her to one side, made her sing, and this is what I said while she was singing:"
"Un jour que je me sentais plus incertaine et plus abattue que jamais, j'allai dans sa cellule; ma présence l'interdit d'abord: elle lut apparemment dans mes yeux, dans toute ma personne, que le sentiment profond que je portais en moi était au-dessus de ses forces; et elle ne voulait pas lutter sans la certitude d'être victorieuse. Cependant elle m'entreprit, elle s'échauffa peu à peu; à mesure que ma douleur tombait, son enthousiasme croissait: elle se jeta subitement à genoux, je l'imitai. Je crus que j'allais partager son transport, je le souhaitais; elle prononça quelques mots, puis tout à coup elle se tut. J'attendis inutilement: elle ne parla plus, elle se releva, elle fondait en larmes, elle me prit par la main, et me serrant entre ses bras: «Ah! chère enfant, me dit-elle, quel effet cruel vous avez opéré sur moi! Voilà qui est fait, l'esprit s'est retiré, je le sens: allez, que Dieu vous parle lui-même, puisqu'il ne lui plaît pas de se faire entendre par ma bouche...»","One day when I felt more uncertain and more dejected than ever, I went to his cell; my presence forbids it at first: she apparently read in my eyes, in my whole person, that the deep feeling I carried within me was beyond her strength; and she did not want to fight without the certainty of being victorious. However, she attacked me, she warmed up little by little; as my pain subsided, her enthusiasm grew: she suddenly threw herself on her knees, I imitated her. I thought I was going to share his transport, I wished; she said a few words, then suddenly she was silent. I waited in vain: she said no more, she got up, she burst into tears, she took me by the hand, and hugging me in her arms: “Ah! dear child, she said to me, what a cruel effect you have had on me! That is what is done, the spirit has withdrawn, I feel it: go, let God speak to you himself, since it does not please him to be heard by my mouth...»","One day, when I was feeling more uncertain and despondent than ever, I went to her cell. At first she was disconcerted by my presence. She seemed to be able to tell from my eyes, indeed from everything about me, that the deep emotion within me was more than she could cope with, and she did not want to struggle against it without being sure of victory. Nevertheless she took me to task, she became more and more heated, and, as my pain dwindled, her enthusiasm grew. She suddenly fell to her knees, and I did likewise. I thought I was going to share in her ecstasy: that is what I wanted to happen. She said a few words and then suddenly went silent. I waited in vain. She said nothing else, stood up, burst into tears, took hold of my hand, and, holding me in her arms, said: ‘Oh! Dear child, what a cruel effect you’ve had on me! That’s it, the Spirit has left me, I can feel it. Go, and may God speak to you himself, for it does not please him to do so through my mouth.’","One day when I was more perplexed and downcast than ever, I went to her cell. At first the sight of me filled her with confusion, for clearly she could read in my eyes and in my whole person that the deep emotion within me was beyond her power to touch, and she was loth to struggle without the certainty of winning. But she did make the attempt, and gradually she warmed to the task, and as my depression waned so her enthusiasm waxed – she suddenly fell upon her knees and I did the same. I believed I was about to share her ecstasy, and wanted to, but she said a few words and then suddenly stopped. I waited in vain, she said no more but rose to her feet, burst into tears, took my hand and held me in her arms. ‘Ah, my dear child,’ she said, ‘what a cruel effect you have had upon me! Well, it’s no use going on , I can feel that the spirit has gone out of me. So may God speak to you Himself, since it does not please Him to do so through my mouth.’"
"Voilà ce que je vous disais alors: mais, hélas! elle n'est plus, et je reste seule...","This is what I said to you then: but, alas! she is no more, and I remain alone...","That is what I told you at the time, but alas she is no more, and I am left all alone.","That is what I told you then, but alas, she is no more, and I am left alone…"

"J'allai. Elle me fit asseoir dans son fauteuil à côté de son lit, et elle se mit sur une chaise un peu plus basse; je la dominais un peu, parce que je suis plus grande, et que j'étais plus élevée. Elle était si proche de moi, que mes deux genoux étaient entrelacés dans les siens, et elle était accoudée sur son lit. Après un petit moment de silence, je lui dis:","I went. She made me sit down in her armchair beside her bed, and she sat down on a slightly lower chair; I dominated it a little, because I am taller, and I was higher.

"Il était tard. Je rêvai une partie de la nuit à ce qu'on venait de me révéler; j'y rêvai encore le lendemain. Je n'avais point de père; le scrupule m'avait ôté ma mère; des précautions prises, pour que je ne pusse prétendre aux droits de ma naissance légale; une captivité domestique fort dure; nulle espérance, nulle ressource. Peut-être que, si l'on se fût expliqué plus tôt avec moi, après l'établissement de mes sœurs, on m'eût gardée à la maison qui ne laissait pas que d'être fréquentée, il se serait trouvé quelqu'un à qui mon caractère, mon esprit, ma figure et mes talents auraient paru une dot suffisante; la chose n'était pas encore impossible, mais l'éclat que j'avais fait en couvent la rendait plus difficile: on ne conçoit guère comment une fille de dix-sept à dix-huit ans a pu se porter à cette extrémité, sans une fermeté peu commune; les hommes louent beaucoup cette qualité, mais il me semble qu'ils s'en passent volontiers dans celles dont ils se proposent de faire leurs épouses. C'était pourtant une ressource à tenter avant que de songer à un autre parti; je pris celui de m'en ouvrir à ma mère; et je lui fis demander un entretien qui me fut accordé.","It was late. I dreamed part of the night about what had just been revealed to me; I dreamed about it again the next day. I had no father; scruples had deprived me of my mother; the precautions taken so that I could not claim the rights of my legal birth; a very harsh domestic captivity; no hope, no resource. Perhaps, if they had explained it to me sooner, after the establishment of my sisters, they had kept me at the house which did not fail to be frequented, there would have been someone to whom my character, my mind, my figure and my talents would have seemed a sufficient dowry; the thing was not yet impossible, but the brilliance I had made in a convent made it more difficult: one can hardly conceive how a girl of seventeen or eighteen could carry herself to such extremity, without uncommon firmness; men praise this quality a great deal, but it seems to me that they willingly do without it in those whom they intend to make their wives. It was, however, a resource to be tried before thinking of another party; I took the decision to tell my mother about it; and I asked him for an interview, which was granted to me.","It was late. I spent part of the night pondering what had just been revealed to me; I was still thinking about it the next day. I was fatherless; scruples had robbed me of my mother; steps had been taken to ensure that I could lay no claim to the rights that were legally mine by birth; an extremely harsh domestic captivity; no hope, no means of support. Perhaps if I had been told the truth earlier, after my sisters had been married off, if I had been allowed to stay at home, where they were still living, then there might have been someone who would have found my character, my mind, my appearance, and my abilities a sufficient dowry. This could still happen, but the scandal that I had caused in the convent made it more difficult: it is seldom understood how a girl of seventeen or eighteen years of age can have driven herself to such lengths without a rare degree of determination. Men praise this quality highly in each other, but it seems to me that they willingly forgo it in a potential wife. Yet it was a possibility worth pursuing before trying to think of something else. I decided to confide in my mother. I requested a meeting with her, which she granted.","It was late. Part of the night and the next day were spent in turning over in my mind what had been revealed to me. I had no father, religious scruples had deprived me of a mother, precautions had been taken against my claiming the rights of legitimate birth, there was nothing but harsh domestic captivity, no hope, no resource. Perhaps, had the situation been explained earlier, after my sisters’ marriages, I might have been kept at home where there was no lack of visitors, and some man might have appeared who considered my character, intelligence, face and talents a sufficient dowry. That was still not quite impossible, but the sensation I had caused in the convent made it more difficult, for it is hardly credible that a girl of seventeen or eighteen could have gone to such lengths without uncommon strength of character. Men praise this quality highly, but it seems to me that they are glad to dispense with it in women they propose to take for their wives. Nevertheless it was a course of action to try before thinking of some other way, and I decided to take my mother into my confidence, and so asked for an interview, which was granted."

Je ne demandai au ciel que le bonheur d'être interrogée et entendue sans partialité; je l'obtins, mais vous allez apprendre à quel prix. S'il était de mon intérêt de paraître devant mon juge innocente et sage, il n'importait pas moins à ma supérieure qu'on me vît méchante, obsédée du démon, coupable et folle. Aussi, tandis que je redoublais de ferveur et de prières, on redoubla de méchancetés: on ne me donna d'aliments que ce qu'il en fallait pour m'empêcher de mourir de faim; on m'excéda de mortifications; on multiplia autour de moi les épouvantes; on m'ôta tout à fait le repos de la nuit; tout ce qui peut abattre la santé et troubler l'esprit, on le mit en œuvre; ce fut un raffinement de cruauté dont vous n'avez pas d'idée.

Also, while I redoubled my fervor and my prayers, they redoubled their wickedness: they only gave me enough food to prevent me from dying of hunger; they overwhelmed me with mortifications; Terrors were multiplied around me; I was completely deprived of the rest of the night; everything that can break down health and trouble the mind was done; it was a refinement of cruelty of which you have no idea.

Since it was in my interest to appear innocent and sensible before my judge, it was no less important to my Mother Superior that I should be seen as wicked, possessed by the devil, guilty, and mad. So, whilst I was doubly fervent and prayerful, they were doubly nasty: I was given only enough food to stop me from starving to death, they overwhelmed me with mortifications, and terrified me more and more on every side; I was totally deprived of sleep at night; they did all they could to weaken my health and to derange my mind: you cannot begin to imagine how well they had perfected the art of cruelty.

"Une fille demanda à ses parents la permission d'entrer parmi nous. Son père lui dit qu'il y consentait, mais qu'il lui donnait trois ans pour y penser.

Sa vocation ne s'étant point démentie, elle retourna à son père, et elle lui dit que les trois ans étaient écoulés. «Voilà qui est bien, mon enfant, lui répondit-il; je vous ai accordé trois ans pour vous éprouver, j'espère que vous voudrez bien m'en accorder autant pour me résoudre...» Cela parut encore beaucoup plus dur, et il y eut des larmes répandues; mais le père était un homme ferme qui tint bon. Au bout de ces six années elle entra, elle fit profession.

Elle s'adressa aux grands vicaires, qui lui accordèrent la permission qu'elle sollicitait. Elle entra; elle courut à la cellule de son enfant; mais quel fut son étonnement de n'y voir que les quatre murs tout nus! On en avait tout enlevé. On se doutait bien que cette mère tendre et sensible ne laisserait pas sa fille dans cet état; en effet, elle la remeubla, la remit en vêtements et en linge, et protesta bien aux religieuses que cette curiosité lui coûtait trop cher pour l'avoir une seconde fois; et que trois ou quatre visites par an comme celle-là ruineraient ses frères et ses sœurs...

This seemed much harder still, and there were tears shed; but the father was a firm man who held on. At the end of these six years she entered, she made her profession. She was a good nun, simple, pious, exact in all her duties; but it happened that the directors abused his frankness to inform themselves at the court of penitence of what passed in the house. Our superiors suspected it; she was locked up; deprived of the exercises of religion; she became mad about it: and how could the head resist the persecutions of fifty people who occupy themselves from the beginning of the day until the end in tormenting you? Previously, a trap had been laid for his mother, which clearly shows the avarice of the cloisters.

How many mothers like mine expiate a secret crime by another!","* A girl asked her parents’ permission to enter our convent. Her father told her that he agreed, but he gave her three years to think about it. The young girl, full of fervour, found her father’s ruling difficult to accept, but accept it she must. Not having wavered in her vocation, she went back to her father and told him that the three years had passed. ‘Very good, my child,’ he replied. ‘I gave you three years to test you, and I hope now that you will be good enough to give me the same amount of time to make up my mind.’ She found that more difficult still and she wept, but her father was a firm man who stood his ground. After six years she entered the convent and made her profession. She was a good nun, simple, pious, and scrupulous in performing all her tasks, but the confessors took advantage of her openness to find out from her in the confessional what was going on in the convent.

For how can the mind withstand being persecuted by fifty people, all of whom devote every minute of the day to tormenting you? Previously they had set her mother a trap which is a good illustration of how greedy convents are. They instilled into the nun’s mother the idea of coming to the convent and visiting her daughter in her cell. She asked the Vicars General, who granted her the permission she sought. She came in and ran to her daughter’s cell, but just imagine her surprise when she found there nothing but four bare walls! Everything had been taken away, and they felt sure that this loving and sensitive mother would not leave her daughter in such a state. And indeed she did not, for she refurnished the cell, gave her daughter new clothes and undergarments, and protested to the nuns that her desire to visit had cost her too much to come a second time, and that three or four such visits a year would spell the ruin of the girl’s brothers and sisters.

Her father said he consented, but gave her three years to think it over. This decree seemed hard to the girl, who was full of zeal, but she had to submit.

It was calculated that this loving and impressionable mother would not leave her daughter in such conditions, and of course she refurnished the room, set her up again in clothes and linen, but protested to the nuns that her curiosity was too expensive for her to indulge in a second time, and that three or four such visits in a year would ruin the girl’s brothers and sisters.

Je m'occupais à lui dérober l'horreur qu'elle m'inspirait, depuis que par une heureuse ou fatale curiosité j'avais appris à la mieux connaître.","She no longer shunned me; she looked at me; but my presence no longer seemed to disturb her. I occupied myself in stealing from her the horror with which she inspired me, ever since, by a happy or fatal curiosity, I had learned to know her better.","She no longer avoided me, she even watched me; my presence seemed no longer to upset her. I did my best to conceal from her the horror that she had inspired in me ever since my fortunate or fatal curiosity had taught me more about her.","She no longer avoided me and could now look at me, and my presence no longer seemed to disturb her. My constant concern was to prevent her from seeing the revulsion she inspired in me now that through a fortunate or fatal curiosity I had learned to know her better."
"M. Manouri vint à Longchamp dans la soirée même: je tins parole à l'archidiacre; je refusai de lui parler. Le lendemain il m'écrivit par son émissaire; je reçus sa lettre et je l'envoyai, sans l'ouvrir, à M. Hébert. C'était le mardi, autant qu'il m'en souvient. J'attendais toujours avec impatience l'effet de la promesse de l'archidiacre et des mouvements de M. Manouri. Le mercredi, le jeudi, le vendredi se passèrent sans que j'entendisse parler de rien. Combien ces journées me parurent longues! Je tremblais qu'il ne fût survenu quelque obstacle qui eût tout dérangé. Je ne recouvrais pas ma liberté, mais je changeais de prison; et c'est quelque chose. Un premier événement heureux fait germer en nous l'espérance d'un second; et c'est peut-être là l'origine du proverbe qu'un bonheur ne vient point sans un autre.","M. Manouri came to Longchamp the same evening: I kept my word to the archdeacon; I refused to speak to him. The next day he wrote to me through his emissary; I received his letter and sent it, unopened, to M. Hébert. It was Tuesday, as far as I remember. I was still impatiently awaiting the effect of the Archdeacon's promise and Mr. Manouri's movements. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday passed without my hearing of anything. How long these days seemed to me! I was afraid that some obstacle had arisen that would have disturbed everything. I did not recover my freedom, but I changed prison; and that's something. A first happy event germinates in us the hope of a second; and this is perhaps the origin of the proverb that one happiness does not come without another.","Monsieur Manouri came to Longchamp that evening. I kept my word to the Archdeacon and refused to speak to him. The next day he wrote to me through his representative. As soon as I received the letter, I sent it on, unopened, to Monsieur Hébert. That was on the Tuesday, if I remember rightly. I eagerly awaited the outcome of the Archdeacon’s promise and Monsieur Manouri ’s efforts. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday came and went without my hearing any news. How long those days seemed to me! I was terrified that some obstacle had emerged which had spoilt everything. I was not regaining my freedom, I was simply moving from one prison to another, but that is something in itself. One happy event makes us hope for another, and that’s perhaps where the proverb comes from: that one good thing leads to another.","Monsieur Manouri came to Longchamp that very evening, but I kept my word to the Archdeacon and refused to speak to him. The following day he wrote to me through his representative. I received his letter and sent it on unopened to Monsieur Hebert. That was on Tuesday, if I remember rightly. I was impatiently waiting for the result of the Archdeacon’s promise and Monsieur Manouri ’s activities. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday went by with no news at all, and how long those days seemed! I was terrified that some hitch had occurred and upset everything. I was not getting back my freedom, but was changing prisons, and that was something. One thing that goes well raises our hopes for a second, which is perhaps the origin of the saying that good things, like troubles, never come singly."
"—Je ne le crois pas; mais pour s'en assurer, le plus court c'est de lui écrire.","-I do not believe that; but to be sure, the shortest way is to write to him.","‘No, I don’t think so, but in order to be sure the easiest thing to do is to write to him.’","‘Of course not, but the quickest way to find out is to write to him.’"
"Je prévois, monsieur le marquis, que vous allez prendre mauvaise opinion de moi; mais puisque je n'ai point eu honte de ce que j'ai fait, pourquoi rougirais-je de l'avouer? Et puis comment supprimer dans ce récit un événement qui n'a pas laissé que d'avoir des suites? Disons donc que j'ai un tour d'esprit bien singulier; lorsque les choses peuvent exciter votre estime ou accroître votre commisération, j'écris bien ou mal, mais avec une vitesse et une facilité incroyables; mon âme est gaie, l'expression me vient sans peine, mes larmes coulent avec douceur, il me semble que vous êtes présent, que je vous vois et que vous m'écoutez. Si je suis forcée au contraire de me montrer à vos yeux sous un aspect défavorable, je pense avec difficulté, l'expression se refuse, la plume va mal, le caractère même de mon écriture s'en ressent, et je ne continue que parce que je me flatte secrètement que vous ne lirez pas ces endroits. En voici un:","I foresee, Monsieur le Marquis, that you are going to take a bad opinion of me; but since I have not been ashamed of what I have done, why should I blush to confess it? And then how to suppress in this story an event which has had consequences? Let's say then that I have a very singular turn of mind; when things may excite your esteem or increase your commiseration, I write well or badly, but with incredible speed and ease; my soul is cheerful, the expression comes to me without difficulty, my tears flow gently, it seems to me that you are present, that I see you and that you listen to me. If, on the contrary, I am forced to show myself to your eyes under an unfavorable aspect, I think with difficulty, the expression refuses, the pen goes badly, the very character of my writing is affected, and I continue only because that I secretly flatter myself that you will not read these places. Here is one:","I can tell now, Monsieur le Marquis, that you are going to have a low opinion of me, but since I did not feel ashamed of what I did, why should I blush to admit it? And how can I leave out of my account an event the consequences of which are still being felt? Let us say, then, that I have a very unusual turn of mind. When I am writing about things that could earn your respect or increase your sympathy for me, I may write well or badly, but always with incredible speed and ease. I am cheerful in heart, words come to me easily, and my tears flow gently. I feel as if you are present, as if I can see you and you are listening to me. But if, on the other hand, I am forced to present myself to you in an unfavourable light, then I have difficulty in thinking, the words do not come to me, my pen falters, the very nature of my writing is affected, and I only carry on because I secretly flatter myself that you will not read those parts. Here is one of them.","I can foresee, Sir, that you are going to have a bad opinion of me, but since I was not ashamed then of what I did why should I blush to admit it? And how can I omit from this story an event which very soon had a sequel? So let us say that I am of a very strange cast of mind: when things could inspire your respect or add to your sympathy I write well or ill, but with incredible speed and facility; I feel gay in heart, expressions come easily to me, I am easily moved to tears and I seem to feel your presence and see you there listening to me. But if on the other hand I am obliged to show myself to you in an unflattering light, I have difficulty in thinking, expressions escape me, my pen labours, even my handwriting is affected, and I only go on because I secretly flatter myself that you will skip these passages.

"Il revint quelques jours après; je le vis au parloir, je l'examinai de plus près. Il acheva de me confier de sa vie, moi de la mienne, une infinité de circonstances qui formaient entre lui et moi autant de points de contact et de ressemblance; il avait presque subi les mêmes persécutions domestiques et religieuses. Je ne m'apercevais pas que la peinture de ses dégoûts était peu propre à dissiper les miens; cependant cet effet se produisait en moi, et je crois que la peinture de mes dégoûts produisait le même effet en lui. C'est ainsi que la ressemblance des caractères se joignant à celle des événements, plus nous nous revoyions, plus nous nous plaisions l'un à l'autre; l'histoire de ses moments, c'était l'histoire des miens; l'histoire de ses sentiments, c'était l'histoire des miens; l'histoire de son âme, c'était l'histoire de la mienne.","He returned a few days later; I saw him in the parlor, I examined him more closely. He ended by entrusting me with his life, me with mine, an infinity of circumstances which formed between him and me so many points of contact and resemblance; he had suffered almost the same domestic and religious persecutions. I didn't realize that the depiction of his disgust was hardly likely to dissipate mine; however, this effect was produced in me, and I believe that the portrayal of my dislikes produced the same effect in him. It is thus that the resemblance of characters being joined to that of events, the more we met again, the more we liked each other; the story of his moments was the story of mine; the story of his feelings was the story of mine; the story of his soul was the story of mine.","He came back a few days later. I saw him in the parlour and questioned him more closely. He finished telling me a whole host of things about his life, as I did about mine, and these became points of contact and similarity between us. He had endured the same domestic and religious persecution as I had. I did not realize that the way he depicted his revulsion was unlikely to help dispel my own, but in fact it did have precisely this effect on me, and I think the way I depicted my revulsion had the same effect on him. So it was that, with the similarity of our characters combining with the similarity of the events in our lives, the more we saw each other, the more we came to like each other. The story of his life was the story of mine; the story of his feelings was the story of mine; the story of his soul was the story of mine.","He did come back a few days later, and I saw him in the parlour and examined him more closely. He finished confiding in me and I found a great number of circumstances in our lives which established between us many points of contact and similarity – indeed he had gone through almost the same domestic and religious persecutions. I did not perceive that the story of his revulsion was not at all calculated to dispel mine; yet that was the effect produced on me, and I believe that the tale of my revulsion produced the same effect upon him. And so it was that our similarity of character, together with that of the events in our lives, made us enjoy each other’s company more as we saw more of each other. The story of certain moments in his life was that of mine, the story of his emotions was that of mine, the story of his soul was that of mine."

"Il arriva un jour qu'il s'en échappa une de ces dernières de la cellule où on la tenait renfermée. Je la vis. Voilà l'époque de mon bonheur ou de mon malheur, selon, monsieur, la manière dont vous en userez avec moi. Je n'ai jamais rien vu de si hideux. Elle était échevelée et presque sans vêtement; elle traînait des chaînes de fer; ses yeux étaient égarés; elle s'arrachait les cheveux; elle se frappait la poitrine avec les poings, elle courait, elle hurlait; elle se chargeait elle-même, et les autres, des plus terribles imprécations; elle cherchait une fenêtre pour se précipiter. La frayeur me saisit, je tremblai de tous mes membres, je vis mon sort dans celui de cette infortunée, et sur-le-champ il fut décidé, dans mon cœur, que je mourrais mille fois plutôt que de m'y exposer. On pressentit l'effet que cet événement pourrait faire sur mon esprit; on crut devoir le prévenir. On me dit de cette religieuse je ne sais combien de mensonges ridicules qui se contredisaient: qu'elle avait déjà l'esprit dérangé quand on l'avait reçue; qu'elle avait eu un grand effroi dans un temps critique; qu'elle était devenue sujette à des visions; qu'elle se croyait en commerce avec les anges; qu'elle avait fait des lectures pernicieuses qui lui avaient gâté l'esprit; qu'elle avait entendu des novateurs d'une morale outrée, qui l'avaient si fort épouvantée des jugements de Dieu, que sa tête ébranlée en avait été renversée; qu'elle ne voyait plus que des démons, l'enfer et des gouffres de feu; qu'elles étaient bien malheureuses; qu'il était inouï qu'il y eût jamais eu un pareil sujet dans la maison; que sais-je encore quoi? Cela ne prit point auprès de moi. À tout moment ma religieuse folle me revenait à l'esprit, et je me renouvelais le serment de ne faire aucun vœu.","It happened one day that one of the latter escaped from the cell in which she was kept. I live it. This is the period of my happiness or my misfortune, according, sir, to the manner in which you use it with me. I have never seen anything so hideous. She was disheveled and almost without clothes; she dragged iron chains; his eyes were wild; she was tearing her hair out; she beat her chest with her fists, she ran, she screamed; she burdened herself and others with the most terrible imprecations; she was looking for a window to run to. Fear seized me, I trembled in all my limbs, I saw my fate in that of this unfortunate woman, and it was immediately decided in my heart that I would die a thousand times rather than expose myself to it. They foresaw the effect this event might have on my mind; it was thought necessary to warn him. They told me I don't know how many ridiculous lies that contradicted each other about this nun: that she had already been deranged when they received her; that she had been terrified at a critical time; that she had become subject to visions; that she thought herself in commerce with the angels; that she had done pernicious readings which had spoiled her mind; that she had heard innovators of an outrageous morality, who had terrified her so greatly of the judgments of God, that her shaken head had been thrown back; that she no longer saw anything but demons, hell and pits of fire; that they were very unhappy; that it was unheard of that there had ever been such a subject in the house; what else do I know what? It didn't take me. Every moment my mad nun came back to my mind, and I renewed my oath not to make any vows.","One day one of these mad nuns escaped from the cell where she had been locked up. I saw her. That was the beginning of my good or bad fortune, depending, Monsieur, on how you decide to treat me. I have never seen a sight more hideous. She was unkempt and almost naked; she was weighed down by iron chains; her eyes were wild; she tore at her hair, beat her chest with her fists, ran about, screamed, called down the most awful curses on herself and on everyone else; she looked for a window to throw herself out of. I was terrified, my whole body shook, I saw that this poor, unfortunate girl’s fate would be mine too, and instantly I made up my mind that I would rather die a thousand deaths than expose myself to that. Others foresaw the effect that this event might have on my mind and they knew they must prevent it. I was told endless ridiculous and contradictory lies about this nun: that she was already mentally deranged when she was admitted to the convent; that she had had a great fright at a critical time of her life; * that she had started having visions; that she believed herself to be in touch with the angels; that she had read pernicious works which had ruined her mind; that she had listened to new thinkers peddling an unorthodox moral code, who had made her so frightened about God’s judgement that her mind had been quite disturbed;* that all she saw now was demons, hell, and fiery depths; that they were unfortunate indeed; that such a thing had never been heard of before in the convent; and goodness knows what else! This had no effect on me; my mad nun was constantly on my mind, and I swore again not to take my vows.","There came a day when one of these last escaped from the cell where she was shut up. I saw her. That was the beginning of my good or bad fortune – according, Sir, to how you treat me henceforth. I have never seen anything so horrible. She was all dishevelled and half naked, she was dragging iron chains, wild-eyed, tearing her hair and beating her breast, rushing along and shrieking. She was heaping upon herself and everyone else the most appalling curses, and looking for a window to throw herself out of. I was seized with panic and trembled in every limb, seeing my own fate in that of this unhappy creature, and thereupon a vow was made in my heart that I would die a thousand deaths rather than expose myself to it. They realized the effect this event might have on my mind and that it must be forestalled. So I was told all manner of ridiculous and contradictory lies about this nun, such as that her mind was already deranged when she was admitted, that she had had a terrible shock at a critical stage of her development, she was given to seeing visions, she thought she was in communication with the angels, she had read some pernicious books which had turned her brain, she had listened to the inventors of a new and outlandish moral code who had made her so terrified of the judgement of God that her already weakened mind had given way, she now saw nothing but demons, hell and fiery abysses; and they were most unfortunate, for it was unheard of that there had ever been anyone like that in their house before – and heaven knows what else besides. It didn’t work on me. My demented nun constantly haunted my mind and I constantly swore to myself that I would never take any vow."

"Je ne me rappelle, monsieur, que très-imparfaitement tout ce qu'il me dit. À présent que je compare son discours tel que je viens de vous le rapporter, avec l'impression terrible qu'il me fit, je n'y trouve pas de comparaison; mais cela vient de ce qu'il est brisé, décousu; qu'il y manque beaucoup de choses que je n'ai pas retenues, parce que je n'y attachais aucune idée distincte, et que je ne voyais et ne vois encore aucune importance à des choses sur lesquelles il se récriait avec le plus de violence. Par exemple, qu'est-ce qu'il trouvait de si étrange dans la scène du clavecin? N'y a-t-il pas des personnes sur lesquelles la musique fait la plus violente impression? On m'a dit à moi-même que certains airs, certaines modulations changeaient entièrement ma physionomie: alors j'étais tout à fait hors de moi, je ne savais presque pas ce que je devenais; je ne crois pas que j'en fusse moins innocente. Pourquoi n'en eût-il pas été de même de ma supérieure, qui était certainement, malgré toutes ses folies et ses inégalités, une des femmes les plus sensibles qu'il y eût au monde? Elle ne pouvait entendre un récit un peu touchant sans fondre en larmes; quand je lui racontai mon histoire, je la mis dans un état à faire pitié. Que ne lui faisait-il un crime aussi de sa commisération? Et la scène de la nuit, dont il attendait l'issue avec une frayeur mortelle... Certainement cet homme est trop sévère.","I remember, sir, only very imperfectly all that he said to me. Now that I compare his speech as I have just reported it to you, with the terrible impression he made on me, I find no comparison there; but that comes from the fact that it is broken, disjointed; that there are many things missing which I did not retain, because I did not attach any distinct idea to them, and that I did not see and still do not see any importance in things over which he protested with the greatest violence. For example, what did he find so strange about the harpsichord scene? Are there not people upon whom music makes the most violent impression? I've been told to myself that certain airs, certain modulations completely change my face: then I was completely beside myself, I hardly knew what I was becoming; I don't think I was any less innocent. Why should it not have been the same with my superior, who was certainly, despite all her follies and her inequalities, one of the most sensitive women in the world? She could not hear a touching story without bursting into tears; when I told her my story, I put her in a pitiful state. Why didn't he also make a crime of his commiseration? And the scene of the night, the issue of which he awaited with mortal fear...Certainly this man is too severe.","I have only a very imperfect recollection, Monsieur, of everything he said. Now that I come to compare what he said as I have just reported it to you with the terrible impact it had on me at the time, there is no comparison, but that is because it is now broken up and disconnected and there are lots of things I have forgotten, because I had no clear idea about them and did not see, and still do not see, the significance of those things to which he took the strongest exception. For example, what did he find so strange about what happened when I was playing the harpsichord? Are there not people who are strongly affected by music? I myself have been told that certain tunes and modulations caused my facial expression to change completely. At such times I was utterly beside myself and hardly knew what was happening to me. I do not believe that I was any the less innocent for that. Why could it not have been the same with my Mother Superior who, despite all her manias and unpredictability, was certainly one of the most sensitive women in the world? She could not hear even a remotely sad story without bursting into tears. When I told her about my past, I reduced her to a pitiful state. Why did he not turn her compassion into a crime too? And the things that happened that night, the consequences of which he awaited in mortal fear... That man really is too harsh.","I have only an imperfect recollection, Sir, of all he said. At present, when I am comparing what he said as I have just set it down for you with the terrifying impression it made on me at the time, I can find no comparison. But that is because as it is set down it is broken and disconnected, and many things are left out which I have not kept in my mind because I had no clear idea about them, and did not see, and still do not see, any significance in things to which he took the strongest exception. For example, what did he think was so strange about the scene at the keyboard? Are there not people on whom music makes the most violent impression? I myself have been told that certain tunes and modulations completely changed my facial expression; at such times I was quite beside myself and hardly knew what I was doing, but I don’t think I was any the less innocent for that. Why couldn’t it have been the same with the Superior who, for all her quirks and caprices, was one of the most sensitive women in the world? She could never hear a pathetic story without bursting into tears, and when I told her my own story I reduced her to a pitiful state. Why didn’t he make her sympathy a crime as well? And the scene at night, the end of which he was waiting for in mortal dread… Decidedly this man is too severe."

He made a thousand odd requests of me, which I still don't understand now that I remember them. He treated me with indulgence; but he spoke about the Superior in terms that made me shudder; he called her unworthy, libertine, bad nun, pernicious woman, corrupt soul; and enjoined me, under pain of mortal sin, never to find myself alone with her, and not to suffer any of her caresses.","I made my confession and then fell silent, but the confessor pressed me and I held nothing back from him. He asked me a thousand strange things which even now, as I recall them, I still do not understand. He was kind to me, but he talked about the Superior in terms which made me shudder. He called her unworthy, dissolute, a bad nun, a pernicious woman, and a corrupt soul, and he ordered me on pain of mortal sin never to be alone with her or to accept any of her caresses.","I made my confession and then stopped speaking, but he did question me and I kept nothing back.

"Je priais, lorsque l'archidiacre, ses deux compagnons et la supérieure parurent dans ma cellule. Je vous ai dit que j'étais sans tapisserie, sans chaise, sans prie-dieu, sans rideaux, sans matelas, sans couvertures, sans draps, sans aucun vaisseau, sans porte qui fermât, presque sans vitre entière à mes fenêtres. Je me levai; et l'archidiacre s'arrêtant tout court et tournant des yeux d'indignation sur la supérieure, lui dit:","I was praying when the archdeacon, his two companions and the superior appeared in my cell. I told you that I was without a tapestry, without a chair, without a prie-dieu, without curtains, without a mattress, without blankets, without sheets, without any vessel, without a door that could be closed, almost without a whole pane of glass in my windows. I got up; and the archdeacon, stopping short and turning his eyes in indignation on the superior, said to her:","I was praying when the Archdeacon, his two companions, and the Mother Superior came into my cell. As I have told you, I had no wall hangings, no chair, no prayer stool, no curtains, no mattress, no blankets, no sheets, no utensils whatsoever, no door that could be closed, and hardly a pane of glass in my windows.

"Un jour de grande fête, c'était, je crois, le jour de l'Ascension, on embarrassa ma serrure; je ne pus aller à la messe; et j'aurais peut-être manqué à tous les autres offices, sans la visite de M. Manouri, à qui l'on dit d'abord que l'on ne savait pas ce que j'étais devenue, qu'on ne me voyait plus, et que je ne faisais aucune action de christianisme. Cependant, à force de me tourmenter, j'abattis ma serrure, et je me rendis à la porte du chœur, que je trouvai fermée, comme il arrivait lorsque je ne venais pas des premières. J'étais couchée à terre, la tête et le dos appuyés contre un des murs, les bras croisés sur la poitrine, et le reste de mon corps étendu fermait le passage; lorsque l'office finit, et que les religieuses se présentèrent pour sortir, la première s'arrêta tout court; les autres arrivèrent à sa suite; la supérieure se douta de ce que c'était, et dit:","One day of great celebration, it was, I believe, the day of the Ascension, they jammed my lock; I could not go to mass; and I would perhaps have missed all the other offices, had it not been for the visit of M. Manouri, who was first told that they did not know what had become of me, that they did not saw more, and that I was not doing any act of Christianity. However, by dint of tormenting myself, I knocked down my lock, and I went to the door of the choir, which I found closed, as it happened when I did not come from the first. I was lying on the ground, my head and back leaning against one of the walls, my arms crossed on my chest, and the rest of my body stretched out closing the passage; when the service ended, and the nuns presented themselves to go out, the first stopped short; the others followed him; the superior guessed what it was, and said:","One particular feast day, it was Ascension Day, I think, the lock on my door had been tampered with and I could not go to mass, and I might have missed all the other services if I had not been visited by Monsieur Manouri, who was told at first that nobody knew what had happened to me, that nobody saw me any more, and that I had abandoned my Christian observances. But I struggled with it and eventually managed to break open the lock, and I went down to the door to the choir which I found closed, as it always was whenever I was not one of the first to arrive. I lay on the ground, with my head and back against one of the walls and my arms crossed across my chest, and with the rest of my body I stretched out and blocked the passageway when the office finished and the nuns came to leave. The first one stopped short and the others followed behind her. The Mother Superior guessed what had happened and said:","One Holy-day of Obligation, Ascension Day I think it was, my lock was put out of order and I could not go to Mass, and I should perhaps have missed other services had not Monsieur Manouri come to see me. At first he was told that they did not know what had become of me , nobody had seen me and I had given up all my Christian observances. But by dint of struggling I broke the lock and made for the door to the choir, which I found closed as was always the case if I was not one of the first to arrive. I lay sprawled on the ground with my head and back propped against one of the walls, my arms crossed over my breast and the rest of my body stretched across the passage and blocking it. When the service was over and the nuns appeared on their way out , the first one stopped dead, the others caught up with her and the Superior, guessing what it was, said:"
"Une nuit, elle descendit seule à l'église; quelques-unes de nos sœurs la suivirent; elle se prosterna sur les marches de l'autel, elle se mit à gémir, à soupirer, à prier tout haut; elle sortit, elle rentra; elle dit: «Qu'on l'aille chercher, c'est une âme si pure! c'est une créature si innocente! si elle joignait ses prières aux miennes...» Puis s'adressant à toute la communauté et se tournant vers des stalles qui étaient vides, elle s'écriait: «Sortez, sortez toutes, qu'elle reste seule avec moi. Vous n'êtes pas dignes d'en approcher; si vos voix se mêlaient à la sienne, votre encens profane corromprait devant Dieu la douceur du sien. Qu'on s'éloigne, qu'on s'éloigne...» Puis elle m'exhortait à demander au ciel assistance et pardon. Elle voyait Dieu; le ciel lui paraissait se sillonner d'éclairs, s'entr'ouvrir et gronder sur sa tête; des anges en descendaient en courroux; les regards de la Divinité la faisaient trembler; elle courait de tous côtés elle se renfonçait dans les angles obscurs de l'église, elle demandait miséricorde, elle se collait la face contre terre, elle s'y assoupissait, la fraîcheur humide du lieu l'avait saisie, on la transportait dans sa cellule comme morte.","One night she went down to church alone; some of our sisters followed her; she prostrated herself on the steps of the altar, she began to moan, to sigh, to pray aloud; she went out, she came back; she said, ""Let's go get him, he's such a pure soul!"" it is such an innocent creature! if she joined her prayers to mine...» Then addressing the whole community and turning towards stalls which were empty, she exclaimed: «Get out, all of you, let her be alone with me. You are not worthy to approach it; if your voices mingled with his, your profane incense would corrupt before God the sweetness of his. Get away, get away...” Then she urged me to ask heaven for help and forgiveness. She saw God; the sky seemed to him to be criss-crossed with lightning, to open up and rumble above his head; angels descended from it in wrath; the looks of the Divinity made her tremble; she ran in all directions, she buried herself in the dark corners of the church, she begged for mercy, she pressed her face to the ground, she fell asleep there, the damp coolness of the place had seized her, they carried her in her cell as dead.","One night she went down to the church on her own; some of our sisters followed her. She prostrated herself on the altar steps and started moaning, sighing, and praying out loud. She left and came back in again. She said: ‘Go and fetch her! She’s such a pure soul! She’s such an innocent creature! If she joined her prayers with mine...’ And then, addressing the whole community and facing some empty stalls, she would cry: ‘Get out, get out, all of you, and leave her on her own with me. You’re not worthy to go near her. If your voices mixed with hers, your profane incense would corrupt the sweetness of hers before God. Go away, go away...’ And then she would urge me to ask for heaven’s help and forgiveness. She could see God, the heavens seemed to her to be streaked with lightning, to open up and rumble overhead, with angels flying down in wrath, and the face of the Lord made her tremble. She ran about in all directions and hid in the dark corners of the church. She asked for mercy. She pressed her face to the ground and dropped off to sleep. The dank coldness of the place had overcome her and she was carried back to her cell as if she was dead.","One night she went down alone into the church. Some of the sisters followed her.

You are not worthy to go near her, and if your voices blended with hers your profane incense would corrupt the sweetness of hers before God. Go away, go away…’ Then she exhorted me to ask Heaven’s help and forgiveness.

She rushed in all directions, burying herself in the darkest corners of the church, begging for mercy, pressing her face against the ground until she came over drowsy, the dank coldness of the place having affected her, and she was carried lifeless back to her cell."

"Je ne vous ferai pas le détail de mon noviciat; si l'on observait toute son austérité, on n'y résisterait pas; mais c'est le temps le plus doux de la vie monastique. Une mère des novices est la sœur la plus indulgente qu'on a pu trouver. Son étude est de vous dérober toutes les épines de l'état; c'est un cours de séduction la plus subtile et la mieux apprêtée. C'est elle qui épaissit les ténèbres qui vous environnent, qui vous berce, qui vous endort, qui vous en impose, qui vous fascine; la nôtre s'attacha à moi particulièrement. Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait aucune âme, jeune et sans expérience, à l'épreuve de cet art funeste. Le monde a ses précipices; mais je n'imagine pas qu'on y arrive par une pente aussi facile. Si j'avais éternué6 deux fois de suite, j'étais dispensée de l'office, du travail, de la prière; je me couchais de meilleure heure, je me levais plus tard; la règle cessait pour moi. Imaginez, monsieur, qu'il y avait des jours où je soupirais après l'instant de me sacrifier. Il ne se passe pas une histoire fâcheuse dans le monde qu'on ne vous en parle; on arrange les vraies, on en fait de fausses, et puis ce sont des louanges sans fin et des actions de grâces à Dieu qui nous met à couvert de ces humiliantes aventures. Cependant il approchait, ce temps que j'avais quelquefois hâté par mes désirs. Alors je devins rêveuse, je sentis mes répugnances se réveiller et s'accroître. Je les allais confier7 à la supérieure, ou à notre mère des novices. Ces femmes se vengent bien de l'ennui que vous leur portez: car il ne faut pas croire qu'elles s'amusent du rôle hypocrite qu'elles jouent, et des sottises qu'elles sont forcées de vous répéter; cela devient à la fin si usé et si maussade pour elles; mais elles s'y déterminent, et cela pour un millier d'écus qu'il en revient à leur maison. Voilà l'objet important pour lequel elles mentent toute leur vie, et préparent à de jeunes innocentes un désespoir de quarante, de cinquante années, et peut-être un malheur éternel; car il est sûr, monsieur, que, sur cent religieuses qui meurent avant cinquante ans, il y en a cent tout juste de damnées, sans compter celles qui deviennent folles, stupides ou furieuses en attendant.","I won't give you the details of my novitiate; if we observed all its austerity, we would not resist it; but it is the sweetest time of monastic life. A novice mother is the most indulgent sister we could find. His study is to rob you of all the thorns of the state; it is a course of the most subtle and best prepared seduction. It is she who thickens the darkness that surrounds you, who rocks you, who puts you to sleep, who imposes on you, who fascinates you; ours became particularly attached to me. I don't think there is any soul, young and inexperienced, that is proof against this fatal art. The world has its precipices; but I don't imagine you can get there by such an easy slope. If I had sneezed6 twice in a row, I was dispensed from office, from work, from prayer; I went to bed earlier, I got up later; the rule ceased for me. Imagine, sir, that there were days when I longed for the moment to sacrifice myself. There is not a bad story in the world that you are not told about; we arrange the real ones, we make false ones, and then there are endless praises and thanksgiving to God who protects us from these humiliating adventures. However, it was approaching that time which I had sometimes hastened by my desires. Then I became dreamy, I felt my repugnance awaken and increase. I was going to entrust them7 to the superior, or to our novice mother. These women avenge themselves well for the boredom you cause them: for you must not believe that they are amused by the hypocritical role they play, and the nonsense they are forced to repeat to you; it becomes at last so worn and so sullen for them; but they are determined to do so, and that for a thousand crowns comes to their house. This is the important object for which they lie all their lives, and prepare for young innocents a despair of forty, fifty years, and perhaps an eternal misfortune; for it is certain, sir, that out of a hundred nuns who die before fifty, there are a hundred just damned, without counting those who become mad, stupid or furious while waiting.","I will spare you the details of my noviciate. If one observed all its austerities, it would be unbearable, but it is in fact the most pleasant period of convent life. The novice mistress is the most indulgent sister imaginable. Her aim is to protect you from all the thorns of convent life; it is a lesson in seduction of the most subtle and refined kind. It is she who deepens the darkness surrounding you, who cradles you, who lulls you to sleep, who impresses you, who fascinates you; ours was particularly devoted to me. I do not think there is a single soul, young and inexperienced, who could resist this dark art. The world has its pitfalls, but I do not imagine that they are reached by such a gentle slope. If I sneezed twice, I was dispensed from the Divine Office, work, and prayer; I went to bed earlier, I got up later; the rules did not apply to me. Just imagine, Monsieur, there were days when I longed for the time to sacrifice myself. Not a single unpleasant story happens in the world outside without our being told about it; true stories are embroidered, false ones are invented, and then endless praise and thanksgiving are offered to God for saving us from such humiliations. Meanwhile the moment that I had at times wished for was approaching. Then I became pensive, I felt my resistance returning and growing stronger. I went to the Mother Superior or to the novice mistress and confided in them. These women certainly know how to avenge the trouble novices cause them; for it is wrong to think that they enjoy the hypocritical role they play or the nonsense they are forced to repeat to us. In the end it all becomes so familiar and dull to them. But they remain determined, because doing it earns the convent some thousand écus. * This is the main reason why they lie all their lives and prepare young, innocent girls for forty, fifty years of despair and perhaps eternal suffering. For it is certain, Monsieur, that out of every hundred nuns who die before the age of fifty, there are exactly one hundred who are damned, and of these many in the meantime become mad, weak-minded, or delirious. *","I won’t go into details about my novitiate. If one observed all its austerities one would never survive, yet it is the pleasantest period of monastic life. A novice-mistress is always the most indulgent sister who can be found. Her object is to hide from you all the thorns of the vocation, she subjects you to a course of the most carefully calculated seduction. Her function is to darken still more the shades of night which surround you, to lull you into slumber, to throw dust in your eyes, to fascinate you, and ours paid special attention to me. I don’t believe there exists a single young and inexperienced soul who is proof against this terrible art. There are pitfalls out in the world, but I don’t imagine you reach them down such a gentle slope. I had only to sneeze twice and I was excused from religious observances, work and prayer. I went to bed earlier and rose later, the whole rule was waived for me. Just fancy, Sir, there were times when I actually longed for the day when I should make the final sacrifice. Not a single unsavoury story happens in the world outside without your being told about it, and the true stories are revised and false ones are invented, on top of which endless praises are sung and acts of thanksgiving made to God who shelters us from these humiliating adventures. Meanwhile the day I had sometimes wished to hurry on was drawing near, and then I became thoughtful and felt my distaste coming back more strongly than ever. I went either to the Mother Superior or to our novice-mistress and confided in them. These women are well compensated for the trouble you give them, for one cannot suppose that they enjoy the hypocritical part they play and the nonsense they are forced to say over and over again. It all gets so repetitious and boring for them, but they face up to it for the sake of the thousand crowns their house makes out of it. That is the vital aim for which they spend a lifetime of deceit and prepare for innocent young girls forty or fifty years of despair and probably an eternity of suffering, for it is a certain fact, Sir, that out of every hundred nuns who die before fifty there are exactly one hundred damned, and that taking no account of the ones who in the meantime lose their reason, get feeble-minded or go raving mad."

Lorsqu'elle l'eut appris par celles qu'elle avait envoyées à ma découverte, elle accourut. Elle avait un peu de trouble dans le regard et sur son visage; mais toute sa personne était si rarement ensemble! Sainte-Thérèse était en silence, assise sur son lit, moi debout.

I said to her: “My dear mother, I beg your pardon for having come here without your permission.","At that very moment, the Mother Superior walked in. She had gone to my cell and, discovering that I was not there , she had searched almost the whole convent, but in vain. She had not even thought that I might be in Sainte Thérèse’s cell. When those she had sent to look for me told her where I was, she came running. She looked somewhat perturbed, but then her whole bearing was rarely untroubled! Sainte Thérèse was sitting silently on her bed, and I was standing. I said to her: ‘My dear Mother, please forgive me for coming here without asking permission.’","We were at that point when the Superior came in. She had gone to my cell and not found me there, then had rushed all over most of the house in vain, for it never entered her head that I was with Sister Sainte-Thérèse.

Sainte-Thérèse was sitting silent on her bed, I was standing. I said: ‘Dear Reverend Mother, I beg pardon for coming here without your permission.’"

Je ne sais ce qui se passait en moi; mais j'étais saisie d'une frayeur, d'un tremblement et d'une défaillance qui me vérifiaient le soupçon que j'avais eu que son mal était contagieux.","I realized then, at the trembling that seized her, at the confusion in her speech, at the bewilderment of her eyes and her hands, at her knee which pressed between mine, at the ardor with which she hugged me and at the violence with which her arms embraced me, that her illness would soon take hold of her. I don't know what was going on inside me; but I was seized with a fright, a trembling, and a faintness which confirmed to me the suspicion that I had had that her disease was contagious.","I could tell then from the trembling that gripped her, from the confusion in her speech, from the wild movements of her eyes and hands, from her knee pressing against mine, from the way she was clutching me fervently and embracing me violently that her illness would soon be upon her. I do not know what was going on inside me, but I was gripped by a terror, a trembling, and a dizziness which confirmed in my mind my suspicion that her illness was contagious.","The trembling that began to come over her, the confusion of her speech, the uncontrolled movements of her eyes and hands, her knee pressing between mine, the ardour of her embraces and the tightness of her arms as she held me, all showed me that her malady was about to come over her again. I don’t know what was going on inside me, but I was seized with panic, and my own trembling and faintness justified the suspicion I had had that her trouble was contagious."

"Ma mère mourut au retour d'un petit voyage qu'elle fit, sur la fin de l'automne, chez une de ses filles. Elle eut du chagrin, sa santé avait été fort affaiblie. Je n'ai jamais su ni le nom de mon père, ni l'histoire de ma naissance.

"Nous nous amusions ainsi d'une manière aussi simple que douce, lorsque tout à coup la porte s'ouvrit avec violence; j'en eus frayeur, et la supérieure aussi: c'était cette extravagante de Sainte-Thérèse: son vêtement était en désordre, ses yeux étaient troublés; elle nous parcourait l'une et l'autre avec l'attention la plus bizarre; les lèvres lui tremblaient, elle ne pouvait parler. Cependant elle revint à elle, et se jeta aux pieds de la supérieure; je joignis ma prière à la sienne, et j'obtins encore son pardon; mais la supérieure lui protesta, de la manière la plus ferme, que ce serait le dernier, du moins pour des fautes de cette nature, et nous sortîmes toutes deux ensemble.","We were having fun like this in a way that was as simple as it was sweet, when suddenly the door opened with violence; I was frightened by it, and so was the superior: it was that extravagant Sainte-Thérèse: her dress was in disorder, her eyes were troubled; she scanned both of us with the most bizarre attention; her lips trembled, she could not speak. However, she came to herself, and threw herself at the feet of the Superior; I joined my prayer to his, and again obtained his forgiveness; but the superior protested to her, in the firmest manner, that it would be the last, at least for faults of this nature, and we both went out together.","We were enjoying ourselves in this simple, sweet way when suddenly the door burst open. I was terrified, and so was the Mother Superior. It was the wild Sainte Thérèse. Her clothes were in disarray, she had a disturbed look in her eyes, she stared at both of us in the oddest way; her lips were trembling, she could not speak. Eventually she came to her senses and she threw herself at the Mother Superior’s feet. I added my plea to hers, and again ensured that she was forgiven. But the Mother Superior declared in no uncertain terms that this was the last time, at least as far as offences of this kind were concerned, and the two of us left together.","Thus we were enjoying ourselves in a manner as simple as it was pleasant, when suddenly the door was flung open. I was frightened, and so was the Superior; it was that crazy Sainte-Thérèse , her clothes in disarray, her eyes wild.

"—Chère enfant, si de pareils prétextes étaient écoutés, voyez quels abus il s'ensuivrait! Vous avez fait une démarche inconsidérée; vous vous êtes laissé entraîner par un sentiment de vengeance; vous avez à cœur les châtiments que vous m'avez obligée de vous infliger; vous avez cru qu'ils suffisaient pour rompre vos vœux; vous vous êtes trompée, cela ne se peut ni devant les hommes, ni devant Dieu.

You have taken a rash step; you let yourself be carried away by a feeling of revenge; you take to heart the chastisements you have forced me to inflict on you; you thought they were enough to break your vows; you are mistaken, that cannot be done either before men or before God. Consider that perjury is the greatest of all crimes; that you have already committed it in your heart; and that you are going to consume it.","‘My dear child, if people listened to such excuses, can you imagine the abuses that might follow? You’ve acted thoughtlessly, you’ve let yourself be swept along by feelings of revenge, all you can think about are the punishments you forced me to inflict upon you and you thought that these were enough to allow you to break your vows. But you’re wrong: that simply can’t happen, neither in the eyes of men nor in the eyes of God.

"On accourt à ses cris, on l'emporte; et je ne saurais vous dire comment cette aventure fut travestie; on en fit l'histoire la plus criminelle: on dit que le démon de l'impureté s'était emparé de moi; on me supposa des desseins, des actions que je n'ose nommer, et des désirs bizarres auxquels on attribua le désordre évident dans lequel la jeune religieuse s'était trouvée. En vérité, je ne suis pas un homme, et je ne sais ce qu'on peut imaginer d'une femme et d'une autre femme, et moins encore d'une femme seule; cependant comme mon lit était sans rideaux, et qu'on entrait dans ma chambre à toute heure, que vous dirai-je, monsieur? Il faut qu'avec toute leur retenue extérieure, la modestie de leurs regards, la chasteté de leur expression, ces femmes aient le cœur bien corrompu: elles savent du moins qu'on commet seule des actions déshonnêtes, et moi je ne le sais pas; aussi n'ai-je jamais bien compris ce dont elles m'accusaient: et elles s'exprimaient en des termes si obscurs, que je n'ai jamais su ce qu'il y avait à leur répondre.","They run to his cries, they carry him away; and I cannot tell you how this adventure was disguised; they made the most criminal story out of it: they say that the demon of impurity had taken possession of me; I was supposed to have designs, actions that I dare not name, and bizarre desires to which the obvious disorder in which the young nun had found herself was attributed. In truth, I am not a man, and I do not know what one can imagine of a woman and another woman, and still less of a woman alone; however, as my bed was without curtains, and people came into my room at all hours, what can I tell you, sir? It is necessary that with all their exterior reserve, the modesty of their looks, the chastity of their expression, these women must have a very corrupt heart: they know at least that one commits dishonest acts alone, and I do not know it. ; so I never quite understood what they were accusing me of: and they expressed themselves in such obscure terms that I never knew what there was to answer them.","Her cries drew the attention of the other nuns and they carried her away. I cannot tell you how this episode was misrepresented. It was turned into the most criminal story. They said that I had been possessed by the devil of impurity and they credited me with intentions and actions which I dare not name and bizarre desires which were meant to account for the young nun’s obvious distress. To be frank, I am not a man and I do not know what can be imagined about one woman and another, and still less about a woman on her own. But since my bed had no curtains and since nuns came into my room at all hours of the day and night, what can I say, Monsieur? Despite their outward reserve, their modest looks, and their chaste expression, these women must have truly corrupt hearts. Or at least they know that unseemly acts can be committed on one’s own, whereas I do not. So I have never really understood what they were accusing me of, and they spoke in such an obscure way that I had no idea how to respond.","Hearing her screams they rushed up and carried her away. I cannot tell how this incident was distorted, the most criminal-sounding story was made out of it, it was said that the demon of impurity had possessed me, and I was credited with intentions I dare not mention, and unnatural desires to which they attributed the obvious disarray of the young nun. Of course I am not a man, and I don’t know what can be imagined about one woman and another, still less about, one woman alone, but as my bed had no curtains and people came in and out of my room at all hours, what can I say, Sir? For all their circumspect behaviour, their modest eyes and the chastity of their talk, these women must be very corrupt at heart – anyway they know that you can commit indecent acts alone, which I don’t know, and so I have never quite understood what they accused me of, and they expressed themselves in such veiled terms that I never knew how to answer them."

If your parents die, you’ll find there’s not much for you. You’re refusing now to enter a convent, but in the future you may well regret it.’","‘That, Mademoiselle, I have not been told. But what is all too clear,’ he went on, ‘is that your sisters have been given an enormous advantage over you, and that every imaginable precaution has been taken, by marriage contracts, alienation of property, stipulations, trust funds and other means, to reduce your legal share to a minimum in case some day you are in a position to have recourse to the law to claim restitution. If you lose your parents you will find you have very little; you refuse to go to a convent now, but you may regret not being in one.’"
"Je me tus, je me penchai sur mon oreiller, je lui tendis une de mes mains qu'elle prit.

Elle me serrait quelquefois la main avec force. Elle me demanda brusquement quelle heure il était.","I fell silent, I leaned over my pillow, I held out one of my hands to her, which she took.

She had once been beautiful, but age, while making her features sag, had nevertheless added more dignity to her face by stamping deep lines on it. Her eyes were small, but they seemed either to be looking into herself or right through nearby things so as to read beyond, far away into the past or future. Sometimes she gripped my hand tightly.

"M. Manouri vint quelques jours après. La supérieure lui exposa ce dont il s'agissait; il ne balança pas un moment à être de son avis; on traita mes scrupules de ridiculités; il fut conclu que les religieuses de Longchamp seraient assignées dès le lendemain. Elles le furent; et voilà que, malgré que j'en aie, mon nom reparaît dans des mémoires, des factum, à l'audience, et cela avec des détails, des suppositions, des mensonges et toutes les noirceurs qui peuvent rendre une créature défavorable à ses juges et odieuse aux yeux du public. Mais, monsieur le marquis, est-ce qu'il est permis aux avocats de calomnier tant qu'il leur plaît? Est-ce qu'il n'y a point de justice contre eux? Si j'avais pu prévoir toutes les amertumes que cette affaire entraînerait, je vous proteste que je n'aurais jamais consenti à ce qu'elle s'entamât. On eut l'attention d'envoyer à plusieurs religieuses de notre maison les pièces qu'on publia contre moi. À tout moment, elles venaient me demander les détails d'événements horribles qui n'avaient pas l'ombre de la vérité. Plus je montrais d'ignorance, plus on me croyait coupable; parce que je n'expliquais rien, que je n'avouais rien, que je niais tout, on croyait que tout était vrai; on souriait, on me disait des mots entortillés, mais très-offensants; on haussait les épaules à mon innocence. Je pleurais, j'étais désolée.","Mr. Manouri came a few days later. The Superior explained to her what was at stake; he did not hesitate for a moment to agree with her; they called my scruples ridiculous; it was concluded that the nuns of Longchamp would be assigned the next day. They were; and now, despite my having some, my name reappears in memoirs, factums, at the hearing, and that with details, suppositions, lies and all the blackness that can make a creature unfavorable to its judges and odious to the public. But, Monsieur le Marquis, are lawyers allowed to slander as much as they please? Is there no justice against them? If I had been able to foresee all the bitterness that this affair would entail, I protest to you that I would never have consented to its beginning. We had the care to send to several nuns of our house the documents which were published against me. All the time, they came to ask me for details of horrible events that had no shadow of the truth. The more ignorance I showed, the more guilty I was believed; because I explained nothing, confessed nothing, denied everything, people believed that everything was true; people smiled, people said twisted but very offensive words to me; they shrugged their shoulders at my innocence. I was crying, I was sorry.","Monsieur Manouri came a few days later. The Mother Superior explained the situation to him, he instantly concurred with her, and my scruples were dismissed as ridiculous. It was decided that a writ would be issued against the nuns at Longchamp the following day. And so it was. In spite of myself, my name appeared again in legal documents, statements, and court hearings, complete with details, conjectures, lies, and all the aspersions that can make a creature lose favour in the eyes of judges and appear hateful in the eyes of the public. But, Monsieur le Marquis, are lawyers allowed to malign people as much as they want? Can no action be taken against them? If I could have foreseen all the bitterness that this case would rake up, I swear that I would never have agreed to it in the first place. The documents published against me were deliberately sent to several nuns in our convent. They came in a steady stream to ask me for details about horrible events which had not even a shadow of truth in them. The more ignorance I showed of them, the more they thought me guilty. Since I did not explain anything or admit anything, and since I denied everything, they thought it was all true. They smiled. They spoke to me in a convoluted but nevertheless very offensive way. They shrugged their shoulders at the idea of my innocence. I wept and was disconsolate.","Monsieur Manouri came a few days later. The Superior explained what the matter was, and he was of our opinion without any hesitation; my scruples were dismissed as ludicrous and it was decided that the nuns of Longchamp should be summoned the very next day. And they were. So, whatever I felt about it, my name reappeared in memoranda, statements, hearings, together with details, suppositions, lies and all the calumnies that can blacken a creature in the eyes of her judges and make her odious to the general public. But, Sir, what right have lawyers to calumniate people just as they like? Is there no way of bringing the lawyers to justice? Had I been able to foresee all the bitterness that this affair would entail, I swear I would never have agreed to let it be initiated. They were careful to send copies of the pieces of evidence published against me to some of the nuns in our convent. They were constantly coming and asking me about horrible details which hadn’t a particle of truth, and the more ignorance I showed the more they concluded I was guilty. Because I explained nothing, confessed nothing, denied everything, they thought it was all true, and smiled and made indirect allusions which were most offensive; they shrugged their shoulders at the idea of my innocence. I wept and was in despair."
"Elles allaient mal. M. Manouri publia un premier mémoire qui fit peu de sensation; il y avait trop d'esprit, pas assez de pathétique, presque point de raisons. Il ne faut pas s'en prendre tout à fait à cet habile avocat. Je ne voulais point absolument qu'il attaquât la réputation de mes parents; je voulais qu'il ménageât l'état religieux et surtout la maison où j'étais; je ne voulais pas qu'il peignît de couleurs trop odieuses mes beaux-frères et mes sœurs. Je n'avais en ma faveur qu'une première protestation, solennelle à la vérité, mais faite dans un autre couvent, et nullement renouvelée depuis. Quand on donne des bornes si étroites à ses défenses, et qu'on a affaire à des parties qui n'en mettent aucune dans leur attaque, qui foulent aux pieds le juste et l'injuste, qui avancent et nient avec la même impudence, et qui ne rougissent ni des imputations, ni des soupçons, ni de la médisance, ni de la calomnie, il est difficile de l'emporter, surtout à des tribunaux, où l'habitude et l'ennui des affaires ne permettent presque pas qu'on examine avec quelque scrupule les plus importantes; et où les contestations de la nature de la mienne sont toujours regardées d'un œil défavorable par l'homme politique, qui craint que, sur le succès d'une religieuse réclamant contre ses vœux, une infinité d'autres ne soient engagées dans la même démarche: on sent secrètement que, si l'on souffrait que les portes de ces prisons s'abattissent en faveur d'une malheureuse, la foule s'y porterait et chercherait à les forcer. On s'occupe à nous décourager et à nous résigner toutes à notre sort par le désespoir de le changer. Il me semble pourtant que, dans un État bien gouverné, ce devrait être le contraire: entrer difficilement en religion, et en sortir facilement. Et pourquoi ne pas ajouter ce cas à tant d'autres, où le moindre défaut de formalité anéantit une procédure, même juste d'ailleurs? Les couvents sont-ils donc si essentiels à la constitution d'un État? Jésus-Christ a-t-il institué des moines et des religieuses? L'Église ne peut-elle absolument s'en passer? Quel besoin a l'époux de tant de vierges folles? et l'espèce humaine de tant de victimes? Ne sentira-t-on jamais la nécessité de rétrécir l'ouverture de ces gouffres, où les races futures vont se perdre? Toutes les prières de routine qui se font là, valent-elles une obole que la commisération donne au pauvre? Dieu qui a créé l'homme sociable, approuve-t-il qu'il se renferme? Dieu qui l'a créé si inconstant, si fragile, peut-il autoriser la témérité de ses vœux? Ces vœux, qui heurtent la pente générale de la nature, peuvent-ils jamais être bien observés que par quelques créatures mal organisées, en qui les germes des passions sont flétris, et qu'on rangerait à bon droit parmi les monstres, si nos lumières nous permettaient de connaître aussi facilement et aussi bien la structure intérieure de l'homme que sa forme extérieure? Toutes ces cérémonies lugubres qu'on observe à la prise d'habit et à la profession, quand on consacre un homme ou une femme à la vie monastique et au malheur, suspendent-elles les fonctions animales? Au contraire ne se réveillent-elles pas dans le silence, la contrainte et l'oisiveté avec une violence inconnue aux gens du monde, qu'une foule de distractions emporte? Où est-ce qu'on voit des têtes obsédées par des spectres impurs qui les suivent et qui les agitent? Où est-ce qu'on voit cet ennui profond, cette pâleur, cette maigreur, tous ces symptômes de la nature qui languit et se consume? Où les nuits sont-elles troublées par des gémissements, les jours trempés de larmes versées sans cause et précédées d'une mélancolie qu'on ne sait à quoi attribuer? Où est-ce que la nature, révoltée d'une contrainte pour laquelle elle n'est point faite, brise les obstacles qu'on lui oppose, devient furieuse, jette l'économie animale dans un désordre auquel il n'y a plus de remède? En quel endroit le chagrin et l'humeur ont-ils anéanti toutes les qualités sociales? Où est-ce qu'il n'y a ni père, ni frère, ni sœur, ni parent, ni ami? Où est-ce que l'homme, ne se considérant que comme un être d'un instant et qui passe, traite les liaisons les plus douces de ce monde, comme un voyageur les objets qu'il rencontre, sans attachement? Où est le séjour de la haine, du dégoût et des vapeurs? Où est le lieu de la servitude et du despotisme? Où sont les haines qui ne s'éteignent point? Où sont les passions couvées dans le silence? Où est le séjour de la cruauté et de la curiosité? On ne sait pas l'histoire de ces asiles, disait ensuite M. Manouri dans son plaidoyer, on ne la sait pas. Il ajoutait dans un autre endroit: «Faire vœu de pauvreté, c'est s'engager par serment à être paresseux et voleur; faire vœu de chasteté, c'est promettre à Dieu l'infraction constante de la plus sage et de la plus importante de ses lois; faire vœu d'obéissance, c'est renoncer à la prérogative inaliénable de l'homme, la liberté. Si l'on observe ces vœux, on est criminel; si on ne les observe pas, on est parjure. La vie claustrale est d'un fanatique ou d'un hypocrite.»","They were bad. M. Manouri published a first memoir which caused little sensation; there was too much wit, not enough pathos, almost no reasons. We must not completely blame this skilful lawyer. I absolutely did not want him to attack my parents' reputation; I wanted him to spare the religious state and especially the house where I was; I didn't want him to paint my brothers-in-law and my sisters in too odious colors. I had only a first protest in my favour, solemn indeed, but made in another convent, and never renewed since. When one places such narrow limits on one's defences, and one has to do with parties who put none in their attack, who trample on the just and the unjust, who advance and deny with the same impudence, and who blush neither at imputations, nor suspicions, nor slander, nor calumny, it is difficult to prevail, especially in tribunals, where habit and the boredom of business hardly permit that We examine with some scruple the most important; and where disputes of the nature of mine are always looked upon with an unfavorable eye by the politician, who fears that, on the success of a nun claiming against her vows, an infinity of others will be engaged in the same step: one feels secretly that, if one suffered that the doors of these prisons fall down in favor of an unfortunate, the crowd would go there and would seek to force them. They are busy discouraging us and resigning us all to our fate out of the despair of changing it. It seems to me, however, that in a well-governed state, it should be the opposite: entering religion with difficulty, and leaving it easily. And why not add this case to so many others, where the slightest lack of formality annihilates a procedure, even just for that matter? Are convents so essential to the constitution of a state? Did Jesus Christ institute monks and nuns? Can't the Church absolutely do without it? What need has the husband of so many foolish virgins? and the human species of so many victims? Will we ever feel the need to narrow the opening of these chasms, where future races will lose themselves? Are all the routine prayers that are said there worth an obol that commiseration gives to the poor? God who created sociable man, does he approve of his shutting himself up? Can God who created him so inconstant, so fragile, authorize the temerity of his wishes? Can these wishes, which clash with the general bent of nature, ever be well observed except by a few badly organized creatures, in whom the seeds of the passions are withered, and whom we would rightly range among monsters, if our lights allowed us to know as easily and as well the inner structure of man as his outer form? All those lugubrious ceremonies which are observed at the taking of the habit and at profession, when a man or a woman is consecrated to the monastic life and to misfortune, do they suspend the animal functions? On the contrary, don't they wake up in silence, constraint and idleness with a violence unknown to people in the world, carried away by a crowd of distractions? Where do we see heads obsessed with impure specters following them and agitating them? Where do we see this profound boredom, this pallor, this thinness, all these symptoms of nature languishing and wasting away? Where are the nights troubled by groans, the days soaked in tears shed without cause and preceded by a melancholy to which one does not know what to attribute? Where does nature, revolted by a constraint for which she was not made, breaks down the obstacles that are opposed to her, becomes furious, throws the animal economy into a disorder for which there is no longer any remedy? Where has grief and temper destroyed all social qualities? Where is there no father, no brother, no sister, no relative, no friend? Where does man, considering himself only as a being of a moment and who passes, treat the sweetest connections of this world, like a traveler the objects he encounters, without attachment? Where is the abode of hatred, disgust and vapours? Where is the place of bondage and despotism? Where are the hatreds that cannot be extinguished? Where are the passions brooded in silence? Where is the abode of cruelty and curiosity? We don't know the history of these asylums, Mr. Manouri then said in his plea, we don't know. He added in another place: “To take a vow of poverty is to commit oneself by oath to be lazy and a thief; to take a vow of chastity is to promise God the constant infraction of the wisest and most important of his laws; to take a vow of obedience is to renounce the inalienable prerogative of man, freedom. If one observes these vows, one is criminal; if we do not observe them, we are perjured. Cloister life is that of a fanatic or a hypocrite.”","My case was going badly. Monsieur Manouri published his first account which made little impact. It was too intellectual, not moving enough, and there were almost no justifications. The blame cannot be laid entirely at this able lawyer’s door. I absolutely insisted that he must not attack my parents’ reputation, and I wanted him to handle carefully the religious life and above all the convent that I was in. I did not want him to cast my brothers-in-law and my sisters in too odious a light. All I had in my favour was my first protest, which was certainly solemn, but which had been made in another convent and had not been repeated since. When one imposes such tight limits on one’s defence and when one is dealing with people for whom the best form of defence is attack, who trample underfoot both the just and the unjust, who make allegations and denials with equal impudence, and who are not ashamed to deal in accusations, suspicions, scandalmongering, or calumny, then it is difficult to win, particularly in courts that have become so used to, and so bored with, cases that they rarely examine at all scrupulously, even the most important ones, and where claims like mine are always looked upon unfavourably by the judge who, thinking politically, worries that the success of one nun appealing against her vows would lead to a whole host of others trying to do the same thing. It is secretly felt that if the gates to these prisons were allowed to be flung open for one unfortunate nun, then a whole army of nuns would surge forward and try to force them open. Determined efforts are made to discourage us and to make us all resign ourselves to our fate, in despair of ever being able to change it. ‘ Yet it seems to me that in a well-governed state, the opposite should be the case: it should be difficult to enter the religious life and easy to leave it. And why not add this case to all those others where the slightest error in procedure negates the whole process, however justified that process may be? Are convents so essential to the constitution of a state? Did Jesus Christ institute monks and nuns? Can the Church really not do without them? What need has the bridegroom of so many foolish virgins, * and what need has the human race of so many victims? Will the need never be felt to narrow the opening to these chasms in which future generations will be lost? Are all the routine prayers which are said there worth as much as the penny that charity gives to the poor? Does God, who created man as a social being, approve of him locking himself away? Can God, who created man as such a fickle and fragile being, allow such rash vows? Can these vows, which fly in the face of our natural inclinations, ever be properly observed by anyone other than a few abnormal creatures in whom the seeds of passion have withered and whom we should rightly consider as monsters, if the current state of our knowledge allowed us to understand the internal structure of man as easily and as well as we understand his external form? Do all those doleful ceremonies that are performed at the taking of the habit and at the profession, when a man or woman is dedicated to the monastic life and to misfortune, actually suspend our animal instincts? On the contrary, are not those very instincts stirred up in the silence, constraint, and idleness, and with a violence unknown to people in the world outside who are swept along by a host of distractions? Where does one see minds obsessed by impure visions which haunt them and torment them? Where does one see that profound boredom, that pallor, and those skeletal forms which are all symptoms of nature languishing and wasting away? Where are nights troubled by groans and days filled with tears shed needlessly and preceded by some mysterious melancholy? Where does nature, revolted by a constraint for which it is not intended, smash the obstacles put in its way, become enraged, and throw the whole animal system into incurable disarray? Where have spite and whim destroyed all social qualities? Where are there no fathers, no mothers, no brothers, no sisters, no relatives, and no friends? Where does man, considering himself but an ephemeral, transitory being, treat the sweetest relationships of this world with disinterest, as a traveller treats the things he comes across? Where is the dwelling place of coercion, disgust, and hysteria? Where is the home of servitude and despotism? Where is undying hatred? Where are the passions nurtured in silence? Where is the home of cruelty and curiosity? We do not know the true story of these retreats,’ Monsieur Manouri went on in his address, ‘we simply do not know.’ Elsewhere he added: ‘To make a vow of poverty is to swear to be an idler and a thief. To make a vow of chastity is to swear to God constantly to break the wisest and most important of his laws. To make a vow of obedience is to renounce man’s inalienable prerogative: freedom. If you keep these vows, you are a criminal; if you do not keep them, you are guilty of perjury before God. To live the cloistered life, you have to be either a fanatic or a hypocrite.’","This was not going well at all. Monsieur Manouri published a first memorandum which made little impression – there was too much intelligence and not enough pathos in it, and hardly any real arguments. But one cannot blame it altogether on this skilful advocate, for I absolutely refused to let him besmirch the good name of my parents, I wanted him to tone down his strictures on convent life, and especially on the house in which I was, and I did not want him to paint my brothers-in-law and sisters in too odious colours. All I had in my favour was that my first protestation, momentous it is true, had been made in a different convent and not been renewed since. When you set such narrow limits to your defence and have to deal with opponents who set none to their attack, who trample underfoot just and unjust alike, who make allegations or denials with the same aplomb and who blush neither at imputations, suspicions, gossip nor calumny, you can hardly expect to win, especially before courts in which habit and boredom hardly permit a properly scrupulous examination even of the most important cases, and in which cases of the nature of mine are always looked upon unfavourably by the politician who is afraid that, following the success of one nun appealing against her vows, a host of others will embark on the same project; for he feels in his heart of hearts that if the prison gates were once allowed to be thrown down in favour of one unhappy woman, the whole mob would hurl itself against them and try to force them. They try to discourage us and make us resigned to our fate through despair of ever changing it. Yet it seems to me that in a properly governed state it should be the opposite: difficult to enter into religion but easy to come out. And why not add this kind of case to so many others in which the slightest irregularity of form cancels the whole proceedings, however just they may otherwise be? Are convents so essential to the constitution of a state? Were monks and nuns instituted by Jesus Christ? Can the Church positively not do without them? What need has the Bridegroom of so many foolish virgins? And the human race of so many victims? Will they never realize the necessity for narrowing the entrance to these chasms into which future generations are going to plunge to their doom? Are all the routine prayers which are said there worth as much as the penny that charity gives to the poor? Does God, who made man sociable, approve of his hiding himself away? Can God, who made man so inconstant and frail, authorize such rash vows? Can these vows, which run counter to our natural inclinations, ever be properly observed except by a few abnormal creatures in whom the seeds of passion are dried up, and whom we should rightly classify as freaks of nature if the state of our knowledge allowed us to understand the internal structure of man as well as we understand his external appearance? Do all these lugubrious ceremonies played out at the taking of the habit or the profession, when a man or woman is set apart for the monastic life and for woe, suspend the animal functions? On the contrary, do not these instincts awaken in silence, constraint and idleness with a violence unknown to the people in the world who are busy with countless other things? Where do we see minds obsessed by impure visions which haunt them and drive them on? Where do we see that fathomless boredom, that pallor, that emaciation which are all symptoms of wasting and self-consuming nature? Where are nights troubled by groans and days bathed in tears shed for no reason and preceded by fits of melancholy for which no cause can be found? Where is it that nature, outraged at constraint for which she is not designed, breaks down the obstacles put in her way and in a frenzy of madness throws the working of our bodies into a disorganization beyond all curing? Where have irritation and temper destroyed all the social qualities? Where do neither father, brother, sister, relation nor friend exist? Where is it that man, considering himself as but a creature of a moment and gone tomorrow, treats the most affectionate relationships in this world as a traveller treats odd things he passes, with no attachment? Where is the dwelling-place of hatred, disgust and hysteria? Where is the place of servitude and despotism? Where are undying hatreds and passions nurtured in silence? Where is the home of cruelty and morbid curiosity? Nobody knows the story of these places, went on Monsieur Manouri in his argument, nobody knows. At another point he added: ‘A vow of poverty means binding oneself on oath to be an idler and a thief, a vow of chastity means promising God continual breaking of the wisest and most important of His laws, a vow of obedience means giving up man’s inalienable prerogative, freedom. If one observes these vows one is a criminal, if not one is a perjurer. The cloistered life is that of a fanatic or a hypocrite.’"

J'aurais pu sévir contre vous par les voies les plus dures; je vous ai ménagée: j'ai cru que vous reconnaîtriez vos torts, que vous reprendriez l'esprit de votre état, et que vous reviendriez à moi; vous ne l'avez pas fait.

I had heard no more of the lawyer Manouri; I presumed, or that he had been put off by the difficulties; or that, distracted by amusements or by his occupations, the offers of services he had made to me were far from his memory, and I was not very unhappy with him for it: I have the character given to 'indulgence; I can forgive men everything except injustice, ingratitude and inhumanity. So I excused the lawyer Manouri as much as I could, and all those people in society who had shown so much vivacity in the course of my trial, and for whom I no longer existed; and yourself, Monsieur le Marquis, when our ecclesiastical superiors paid a visit to the house.","I found myself all alone in the convent, and in the world, for I did not know a single person who was interested in me. I had heard no more of the lawyer Manouri; I assumed that he had been either put off by the difficulties or distracted by some amusements or by his own business; the offers of help that he had made me were now far from his thoughts, and I did not really hold that against him; I am by nature inclined to be indulgent and I can forgive men anything, apart from injustice, ingratitude, and inhumanity. So I forgave the lawyer Manouri as much as I could, as well as all those people in the world outside who had shown such excitement during my case and for whom I did not now exist, and you too, Monsieur le Marquis. But at that point our ecclesiastical superiors came to visit the convent.","So now I was alone in that convent and in the world, for I did not know a single person who would be interested in me. I had heard no more of the lawyer Manouri, and I presumed either that he had been discouraged by the difficulties or that he had been taken up with amusements and business, so that the offers he had made me were long forgotten, and I could not altogether blame him. My character tends to be indulgent, and I can forgive men anything except injustice, ingratitude and inhumanity. So I was making allowances for Monsieur Manouri as far as I could, and all those people who had shown so much persistence during my case, and to whom my case now seemed closed, and for you too, Sir. But at that moment our ecclesiastical overseers came and carried out a visitation in the convent."
"J'avais bien prévu que je trouverais plusieurs sortes d'opposition; celle des lois, celles de la maison religieuse, et celles de mes beaux-frères et sœurs alarmés: ils avaient eu tout le bien de la famille; et libre, j'aurais eu des reprises considérables à faire sur eux. J'écrivis à mes sœurs; je les suppliai de n'apporter aucune opposition à ma sortie; j'en appelai à leur conscience sur le peu de liberté de mes vœux; je leur offris un désistement par acte authentique de toutes mes prétentions à la succession de mon père et de ma mère; je n'épargnai rien pour leur persuader que ce n'était ici une démarche ni d'intérêt, ni de passion. Je ne m'en imposai point sur leurs sentiments; cet acte que je leur proposais, fait tandis que j'étais encore engagée en religion, devenait invalide; et il était trop incertain pour elles que je le ratifiasse quand je serais libre: et puis leur convenait-il d'accepter mes propositions? Laisseront-elles une sœur sans asile et sans fortune? Jouiront-elles de son bien? Que dira-t-on dans le monde? Si elle vient nous demander du pain, la refuserons-nous? S'il lui prend fantaisie de se marier, qui sait la sorte d'homme qu'elle épousera? Et si elle a des enfants?... Il faut contrarier de toute notre force cette dangereuse tentative... Voilà ce qu'elles se dirent et ce qu'elles firent.","I had foreseen that I would find several kinds of opposition; that of the laws, those of the religious house, and those of my alarmed brothers and sisters-in-law: they had had all the property of the family; and free, I would have had considerable rework to do on them. I wrote to my sisters; I begged them not to bring any opposition to my going out; I appealed to their conscience on the lack of freedom of my wishes; I offered them a withdrawal by notarial deed of all my claims to the succession of my father and my mother; I spared no effort in persuading them that this was neither a matter of self-interest nor of passion. I did not intrude on their feelings; this act which I proposed to them, done while I was still engaged in religion, became invalid; and it was too uncertain for them that I should ratify it when I should be free: and then did it suit them to accept my proposals? Will they leave a sister without asylum and without fortune? Will they enjoy his good? What will people say in the world? If she comes to ask us for bread, shall we refuse her? If she takes a fancy to get married, who knows what kind of man she will marry? What if she has children?... We must thwart this dangerous attempt with all our might... That's what they said to each other and what they did.","I had already foreseen that I would encounter opposition of many kinds: from the law, from the convent, and from my alarmed brothers-in-law and sisters. They had inherited all the family wealth, and, once free, I would have had a strong claim to make against them. I wrote to my sisters, pleading with them not to oppose in any way my leaving the convent and appealing to their consciences on the question of my having had little freedom of choice when taking my vows. I offered to have a legal deed drawn up confirming that I was renouncing all claim on my father’s and mother’s inheritance. I went to great lengths to persuade them that I was not acting out of self-interest or passion. I failed to sway their feelings. The legal deed I was offering them, if I were to make it while I was still a nun, would become invalid afterwards and my sisters were concerned that I might not abide by it once I was free. And besides, was it in their interest to agree to my proposals? Will they leave a sister with no home and no money? Will they enjoy her wealth? What will people say in the world outside? If she comes to us asking for bread, shall we refuse her? If she takes it into her head to get married, who knows what kind of man she will marry? And what if she has children? We must use all our strength to thwart this dangerous endeavour. That is what they said to themselves and what they did.","Of course I had foreseen that I would encounter many kinds of opposition; from the law, from the religious house itself and from my brothers-in-law and sisters in their alarm. They had all the family money, and if I were free I should have a considerable claim to make on them. I wrote to my sisters and begged them not to oppose my leaving in any way, I appealed to their consciences about having had no freedom of choice over my vows, I offered to make a formal renunciation of any claims I had on my parents’ estate, I spared no pains to persuade them that my action was not prompted by self-interest or passion. But I did not succeed in winning against their instincts: this legal act I was contemplating, being undertaken while I was still in religion, might become invalid, and it was too uncertain from their point of view that I would consider it binding when I was free; and besides, was it in their interests to agree to my proposals? Will they leave a sister with no home and no money? Will they enjoy her money? What will other people 6ay? If she comes to us begging for bread, shall we refuse? If she takes it into her head to get married, who knows what kind of man she will have? And suppose she has children? No, we must thwart this dangerous plan with all our might and main… That is what they said to themselves and what they acted on."

"Le pronostic de M. Bouvard se vérifia; la fièvre diminua, des sueurs abondantes achevèrent de l'emporter; et l'on ne douta plus de ma guérison: je guéris en effet, mais j'eus une convalescence très-longue. Il était dit que je souffrirais dans cette maison toutes les peines qu'il est possible d'éprouver. Il y avait eu de la malignité dans ma maladie; la sœur Ursule ne m'avait presque point quittée. Lorsque je commençais à prendre des forces, les siennes se perdirent, ses digestions se dérangèrent, elle était attaquée l'après-midi de défaillances qui duraient quelquefois un quart d'heure: dans cet état, elle était comme morte, sa vue s'éteignait, une sueur froide lui couvrait le front, et se ramassait en gouttes qui coulaient le long de ses joues; ses bras, sans mouvement, pendaient à ses côtés. On ne la soulageait un peu qu'en la délaçant, et qu'en relâchant ses vêtements. Quand elle revenait de cet évanouissement, sa première idée était de me chercher à ses côtés, et elle m'y trouvait toujours; quelquefois même, lorsqu'il lui restait un peu de sentiment et de connaissance, elle promenait sa main autour d'elle sans ouvrir les yeux. Cette action était si peu équivoque, que quelques religieuses s'étant offertes à cette main qui tâtonnait, et n'en étant pas reconnues, parce qu'alors elle retombait sans mouvement, elles me disaient: «Sœur Suzanne, c'est à vous qu'elle en veut, approchez-vous donc...» Je me jetais à ses genoux, j'attirais sa main sur mon front, et elle y demeurait posée jusqu'à la fin de son évanouissement; quand il était fini, elle me disait: «Eh bien! sœur Suzanne, c'est moi qui m'en irai, et c'est vous qui resterez; c'est moi qui la reverrai la première, je lui parlerai de vous, elle ne m'entendra pas sans pleurer. S'il y a des larmes amères, il en est aussi de bien douces, et si l'on aime là-haut, pourquoi n'y pleurerait-on pas?» Alors elle penchait sa tête sur mon cou; elle en répandait avec abondance, et elle ajoutait: «Adieu, Sœur Suzanne; adieu, mon amie; qui est-ce qui partagera vos peines quand je n'y serai plus? Qui est-ce qui...? Ah! chère amie, que je vous plains! Je m'en vais, je le sens, je m'en vais. Si vous étiez heureuse, combien j'aurais de regret à mourir!»","M. Bouvard's prognosis was verified; the fever subsided, profuse sweats carried him away; and there was no longer any doubt of my recovery: I was indeed cured, but I had a very long convalescence. It was said that I would suffer in this house all the pains that it is possible to experience. There had been malignity in my illness; Sister Ursule had hardly left me. When I began to gain strength, hers were lost, her digestion was disturbed, she was attacked in the afternoon by fainting spells which sometimes lasted a quarter of an hour: in this state, she was as if dead, her eyesight failed. extinguished, a cold sweat covered his forehead, and collected in drops which ran down his cheeks; her arms, motionless, hung at her sides. She was relieved a little only by unlacing her, and releasing her clothes. When she came back from this fainting spell, her first idea was to look for me at her side, and she always found me there; sometimes even, when she had a little feeling and knowledge left, she passed her hand around her without opening her eyes. This action was so unequivocal that some nuns having offered themselves to this groping hand, and not being recognized by it, because then it fell motionless, they said to me: ""Sister Suzanne, it's up to you. she wants it, so come closer...” I threw myself at her knees, I drew her hand to my forehead, and she remained there until the end of her fainting; when it was over, she would say to me: “Well! Sister Suzanne, it is I who will go away, and it is you who will stay; I'll be the first to see her again, I'll talk to her about you, she won't hear me without crying. If there are bitter tears, there are also very sweet ones, and if one loves up there, why shouldn't one cry there? Then she leaned her head on my neck; she sprinkled it abundantly, and she added: “Farewell, Sister Suzanne; farewell, my friend; who will share your sorrows when I am no longer there? Who is who...? Ah! dear friend, how I pity you! I'm leaving, I feel it, I'm leaving. If you were happy, how sorry I would be to die!”","Monsieur B...’s diagnosis proved accurate. The fever abated, quelled finally by heavy sweating, and my recovery was no longer in doubt. I did indeed recover, but I had to convalesce for a very long time. It was said that in that convent I would suffer in every possible way. There had been something spiteful in my illness. Sister Ursule had hardly left my side. As I regained my health and strength, she began to lose hers; her digestion was upset; in the afternoons she was laid low by bouts of fainting, which sometimes lasted a quarter of an hour. Whenever she fainted, she looked as if she had died, her eyes became lifeless, her forehead was covered in a cold sweat, forming drops which ran down her cheeks; her limp arms hung, motionless, by her sides; the only way to give her a little relief was to undo and loosen her clothing. When she came round after fainting, her first instinct was to look for me at her side, where she always found me; and sometimes, when she still had a little feeling and was not entirely unconscious, she even ran her hand around her, without opening her eyes. The significance of this gesture was so clear that those nuns who had reached out to touch her hand as it groped around, but whom she clearly did not recognize since her hand simply fell motionless, said to me: ‘Sister Suzanne, it’s you she wants, come closer... ’ I threw myself at her knees and drew her hand to my forehead, where it rested until she came round. When she regained consciousness, she said to me: ‘So, Sister Suzanne, I’m the one who’s going to depart this world and you’re going to stay; I shall be the first to see her again, and I shall talk to her about you, and she’ll be in tears as she listens (if tears can be bitter, they can also be sweet); and if there is love up there, then why shouldn’t there be crying?’ Then she leant her head on my shoulder, wept copiously, and went on: ‘Farewell, Sister Suzanne, adieu, my friend. Who will share your suffering when I am gone? Who... Oh! My dear friend, how I pity you! I’m going , I can feel it, I’m going. If you were happy, I’d be so sorry to die!’","Monsieur Bouvard’s forecast proved true; the temperature went down thanks to abundant sweating, and my recovery was now certain, and in effect I did recover, but had a very long convalescence. It was ordained that in that establishment I should suffer all the ills it is possible to go through. My illness was infectious, and Sister Ursule had scarcely ever left my side. When I was beginning to recover my strength hers was declining, her digestion was upset, and in the afternoon she was taken with fainting fits lasting sometimes up to a quarter of an hour: when she was in that condition she seemed dead, her sight grew dim, her brow was covered with a cold sweat which accumulated and ran in drops down her cheeks, her arms hung loose at her sides. The only way she could be given some slight relief was by unlacing her and loosening her clothing. When she came out of one of these faints her first thought was to look for me at her side, where she always found me, and sometimes even, when she still had a little feeling and consciousness left, she would feel round with her hand without opening her eyes. This gesture was so clear in its meaning that when various nuns had offered themselves to this groping hand and not been recognized, because she had then gone inert, they said to me: ‘Sister Suzanne, it’s you she wants, come nearer …’ I threw myself down by her and moved her hand to my forehead, where it stayed until she came out of her faint, and when it was over she said: ‘Well, Sister Suzanne, I am the one who is going away and you will stay. I shall be the first to see her, I shall tell her about you and she will not hear me without weeping. There may be bitter tears, but there are also sweet ones, and if there is love in Heaven why not tears?’ She put her head on my shoulder, wept copiously and then went on: ‘Good-bye, Sister Suzanne, good-bye my dear friend. Who will share your troubles when I am no longer there to do so? Who will…? Oh, my dear, I pity you! I am going , I can feel I am, I am going. If you were happy what regrets I should have at dying!’"

All I have to do is develop a tender friendship with someone and he does his best to turn her mind against me. He very nearly drove poor Sainte Thérèse mad.

"Un jour que je sortais de ma cellule pour aller à l'église ou ailleurs, je vis une pincette à terre, en travers dans le corridor; je me baissai pour la ramasser, et la placer de manière que celle qui l'avait égarée la retrouvât facilement: la lumière m'empêcha de voir qu'elle était presque rouge; je la saisis; mais en la laissant retomber, elle emporta avec elle toute la peau du dedans de ma main dépouillée. On exposait, la nuit, dans les endroits où je devais passer, des obstacles ou à mes pieds, ou à la hauteur de ma tête; je me suis blessée cent fois; je ne sais comment je ne me suis pas tuée. Je n'avais pas de quoi m'éclairer, et j'étais obligée d'aller en tremblant, les mains devant moi. On semait des verres cassés sous mes pieds. J'étais bien résolue de dire tout cela, et je me tins parole à peu près.

Il était temps que l'archidiacre arrivât; il était temps que mon procès finît.","One day when I was leaving my cell to go to church or elsewhere, I saw a tongs on the ground, across the corridor; I bent down to pick it up, and place it so that the one who had lost it could find it easily: the light prevented me from seeing that it was almost red; I seize it; but letting it fall, it took with it all the skin inside my stripped hand. They exhibited, at night, in the places where I had to pass, obstacles either at my feet or at the height of my head; I hurt myself a hundred times; I don't know how I didn't kill myself. I had nothing to enlighten me, and I had to go trembling, my hands in front of me. Broken glasses were strewn under my feet. I had made up my mind to say all this, and I more or less kept my word. I found the door to the amenities closed, and I had to go down several flights of stairs and run to the bottom of the garden when the door was open; when she was not. Ah! sir, what wicked creatures are reclusive women, who are quite sure of seconding the hatred of their superior, and who believe they are serving God while driving you to despair! It was time for the archdeacon to arrive; it was time for my trial to end.","One day as I was coming out of my cell to go to church or somewhere else, I saw a pair of fire tongs on the floor in the corridor. I bent down to pick them up so that I could put them where whoever had lost them could easily find them. Because of the light, I could not see that they were almost red hot. I picked them up, but as I dropped them they ripped all the skin off the palm of my bare hand. At night obstacles were left for me wherever I went, either on the floor or at head-height. I was hurt a hundred times, and I do not know how I managed not to kill myself. I had no means of lighting my way, so I had to walk along, tentatively stretching my arms out in front of me. Glasses were smashed and the shards scattered beneath my feet. I was determined to say all this and did so, more or less. I used to find the door to the conveniences locked and had to go down several floors and run down to the bottom of the garden, when the gate was open. But when it was locked... Oh, Monsieur!

Ce fut un M. l'abbé Blin, docteur de Sorbonne, qui m'exhorta, et M. l'évêque d'Alep qui me donna l'habit. Cette cérémonie n'est pas gaie par elle-même; ce jour-là elle fut des plus tristes. Quoique les religieuses s'empressassent autour de moi pour me soutenir, vingt fois je sentis mes genoux se dérober, et je me vis prête à tomber sur les marches de l'autel. Je n'entendais rien, je ne voyais rien, j'étais stupide; on me menait, et j'allais; on m'interrogeait, et l'on répondait pour moi. Cependant cette cruelle cérémonie prit fin; tout le monde se retira, et je restai au milieu du troupeau auquel on venait de m'associer. Mes compagnes m'ont entourée; elles m'embrassent, et se disent: «Mais voyez donc, ma sœur, comme elle est belle! comme ce voile noir relève la blancheur de son teint! comme ce bandeau lui sied! comme il lui arrondit le visage! comme il étend ses joues! comme cet habit fait valoir sa taille et ses bras!...» Je les écoutais à peine; j'étais désolée; cependant, il faut que j'en convienne, quand je fus seule dans ma cellule, je me ressouvins de leurs flatteries; je ne pus m'empêcher de les vérifier à mon petit miroir; et il me sembla qu'elles n'étaient pas tout à fait déplacées. Il y a des honneurs attachés à ce jour; on les exagéra pour moi: mais j'y fus peu sensible; et l'on affecta de croire le contraire et de me le dire, quoiqu'il fût clair qu'il n'en était rien. Le soir, au sortir de la prière, la supérieure se rendit dans ma cellule. «En vérité, me dit-elle après m'avoir un peu considérée, je ne sais pourquoi vous avez tant de répugnance pour cet habit; il vous fait à merveille, et vous êtes charmante; sœur Suzanne est une très-belle religieuse, on vous en aimera davantage. Çà, voyons un peu, marchez. Vous ne vous tenez pas assez droite; il ne faut pas être courbée comme cela...» Elle me composa la tête, les pieds, les mains, la taille, les bras; ce fut presque une leçon de Marcel5 sur les grâces monastiques: car chaque état a les siennes. Ensuite elle s'assit, et me dit: «C'est bien; mais à présent parlons un peu sérieusement. Voilà donc deux ans de gagnés; vos parents peuvent changer de résolution; vous-même, vous voudrez peut-être rester ici quand ils voudront vous en tirer; cela ne serait point du tout impossible.—Madame, ne le croyez pas.—Vous avez été longtemps parmi nous, mais vous ne connaissez pas encore notre vie; elle a ses peines sans doute, mais elle a aussi ses douceurs...» Vous vous doutez bien de tout ce qu'elle put ajouter du monde et du cloître, cela est écrit partout, et partout de la même manière; car, grâces à Dieu, on m'a fait lire le nombreux fatras de ce que les religieux ont débité de leur état, qu'ils connaissent bien et qu'ils détestent, contre le monde qu'ils aiment, qu'ils déchirent et qu'ils ne connaissent pas.","I forgot to tell you that I saw my father and my mother, that I spared no effort to touch them, and that I found them inflexible. It was a Abbe Blin, doctor of the Sorbonne, who urged me, and the Bishop of Aleppo who gave me the habit. This ceremony is not gay by itself; that day she was most sad. Although the nuns crowded around me to support me, twenty times I felt my knees giving way, and I saw myself ready to fall on the steps of the altar. I heard nothing, I saw nothing, I was stupid; I was led, and I went; they questioned me, and they answered for me. However, this cruel ceremony came to an end; everyone withdrew, and I remained in the middle of the herd with which I had just been associated. My companions surrounded me; they embrace me, and say to themselves: “But see, my sister, how beautiful she is! how this black veil raises the whiteness of her complexion! how this headband suits him! how it rounds her face! how he spreads his cheeks! how this coat shows off her figure and her arms!...” I barely listened to them; I was sorry; however, I must admit, when I was alone in my cell, I remembered their flattery; I couldn't help checking them in my little mirror; and it seemed to me that they weren't quite out of place. There are honors attached to this day; they were exaggerated for me, but I was little aware of them; and they pretended to believe the contrary and to tell me so, although it was clear that it was not so. In the evening, after prayer, the Superior came to my cell. “In truth,” she said to me after having considered me a little, “I don't know why you have such a repugnance for this coat; he suits you wonderfully, and you are charming; Sister Suzanne is a very beautiful nun, you will be loved the more for it. Here, let's see, walk. You don't stand straight enough; you mustn't be stooped like that...' She composed my head, feet, hands, waist, arms; it was almost a lesson from Marcel5 on monastic graces: for each estate has its own. Then she sat down and said to me: “That's good; but now let's talk a little seriously. So that's two years gained; your parents may change their resolution; yourself, you might want to stay here when they want you out; that would not be at all impossible.—Madame, don't believe it.—You have been with us for a long time, but you do not yet know our life; she has her sorrows no doubt, but she also has her pleasures...” You can well imagine all that she could add about the world and the cloister, it is written everywhere, and everywhere in the same way; for, thank God, I have been made to read the numerous rubbish of what the religious have ranted about their state, which they know well and which they detest, against the world which they love, which they tear apart and that they don't know.","I forgot to mention that I saw my father and my mother, that I made every effort to soften their hearts, and that I found them inflexible. It was a certain abbé Blin,* a Sorbonne doctor, who read the homily, and the Bishop of Aleppo* who gave me my habit. This ceremony is not by nature a cheerful one, and that day it was one of the saddest ever. * Although the nuns bustled around me and supported me, I felt my knees give way time and time again, and thought I would collapse on the altar steps. I heard nothing, saw nothing; I was in a daze. I was led, and I followed; I was asked questions, and others replied for me. This cruel ceremony eventually came to its end, everybody went away, and I was left with the flock which I had just joined. My companions surrounded me, embracing me and saying to each other: ‘But look, Sister, look how pretty she is! Look how her black veil brings out the whiteness of her complexion! How her headband suits her! How it rounds off her face! How it makes her cheeks stand out! How her habit shows off her waist and her arms!...’ I hardly heard a word they were saying, I felt so wretched. But I must admit that, when I was alone in my cell, I remembered the fulsome things they said. I could not resist looking in my little mirror to see if what they had said was true, and it seemed to me that their flattery was not wholly without foundation. This is meant to be a day of great honour, and the point was emphasized for my benefit, but I was almost oblivious. People pretended to disbelieve me and said so, but it was clear that it was not so. In the evening, after prayers, the Superior came to my cell. ‘Really,’ she said, after looking at me for a short while, ‘I don’t know why you dislike your habit so much. It suits you perfectly, and you look charming. Sister Suzanne is a very beautiful nun, and we will love you all the more for that. Now, let’s have a look at you. Turn around. You’re not holding yourself quite straight; don’t lean forward like that...’ She showed me how to carry myself, my head, my feet, my hands, my body, and my arms. It was almost like being given a lesson by Marcel* on convent style, for each way of life has its own. Then she sat down, and said to me: ‘That’s good, but now let’s talk seriously. The next two years are taken care of. During that time your parents may change their minds, and you yourself will perhaps want to stay here when they want to take you away– that cannot be ruled out altogether.’ ‘No, Madame, don’t believe that.’ ‘You’ve been with us for a long time, but you still don’t know what our life is like. It certainly has its pains, but it also has its pleasures...’ You can well imagine everything she said about the world and the cloister, for it is written about everywhere, and always in the same way. Thank God I was made to read all that nonsense which the religious churn out about their way of life, which they know so well but which they hate, and all of it written to attack the world, which they love, but which they tear to shreds without actually knowing what it is like.","I forgot to mention that I saw my father and mother and did all in my power to touch their hearts, but found them adamant. The exhortation was pronounced by a certain Abbé Blin, Doctor of the Sorbonne, and the Bishop of Aleppo gave me the habit. This ceremony is hardly gay in itself, but that day it was as gloomy as can be. Although the nuns were full of attentions in giving me their support, my knees seemed to be giving way a score of times and I felt myself on the point of collapsing on the altar steps. I heard nothing, saw nothing and was quite dazed. I went where I was led, I was questioned and they answered for me. Yet the cruel ceremony eventually came to an end, the people all went away and I stayed with the flock to which I had been consigned. My companions surrounded me, embraced me, saying to each other: ‘Just look, Sister, isn’t she lovely! How this black veil brings out the whiteness of her skin! How well that band suits her! How it rounds off her face and cheeks! How well her habit shows off her figure and arms!’ I scarcely took in what they were saying, for I was overcome with grief. And yet I must confess that when I was alone in my cell I recalled their flattering remarks and couldn’t resist verifying them in my little mirror, and I felt they were not altogether undeserved. There are special honours belonging to this day, and they were exaggerated in my case but I scarcely noticed, though they pretended to think just the opposite, and told me so, which clearly was not true. That evening after prayers the Superior came into my cell. ‘ Really,’ she said, after looking me up and down, ‘I don’t know why you have such an objection to the habit; it suits you perfectly and you look charming. Sister Suzanne is a very lovely nun, and she will be all the more popular for that. Now let’s see you walk along. You’re not holding yourself quite straight, you mustn’t stoop like that…’ She placed my head, hands and feet, body and arms, and it was almost like one of Marcel’s dancing lessons on convent graces, for there are some for every walk in life. Then she took a seat and said: ‘All right, but now let us talk seriously. We have gained two years. Your parents may change their minds, you yourself may want to stay here when they want to take you away – that would be by no means impossible.’ ‘No, Madame, don’t you believe it.’ ‘You have been with us a long time, but you have no idea yet what our life is like; it may have its sorrows, but it also has its joys.’ You have a good idea of the sort of thing she was certain to have gone on to say about the world and the cloister, for it is written everywhere and in just the same way. For, thank God, I had had to read the piles of rubbish that monks and nuns have produced about their way of life, which they know inside out and loathe, against the world that they love, tear to pieces but don’t know."
"—Allons, me dit-elle, mon enfant, venez. La fraîcheur de l'église pendant la nuit vous incommodera; vous prierez dans votre cellule.»","“Come,” she said to me, “my child, come. The coolness of the church during the night will inconvenience you; you will pray in your cell.”","‘Come along, my child,’ she said, ‘come with me. The cold in the church at night is not good for you. You can say your prayers in your cell.’","‘Come along, my child, the cold in the chapel at night will upset you. You can pray in your cell.’"
"—Le passé me répond de l'avenir; si j'avais voulu écouter le crime, je serais libre. Mais s'il me convient de sortir de cette maison, ce sera, ou de votre consentement, ou par l'autorité des lois. Vous pouvez opter...»","—The past answers me for the future; if I had wanted to listen to the crime, I would be free. But if it suits me to leave this house, it will be either by your consent or by the authority of the law. You can choose...»","‘My past is the best guarantee of my future. If I’d behaved in a criminal manner, I’d be free now. But if I decide that I must leave this convent, I shall do so either with your blessing or on the authority of the law. It’s your decision.’","‘The past guarantees the future, and if I had been inclined towards crime I should be free today. But if I decide that I must leave this establishment, it will be done either with your consent or by the authority of the law. You can choose…’"

"—Je ne me suis donc pas trompée, et les sœurs de Longchamp sont restées en possession de la dot que vous leur avez payée en entrant chez elles?","""So I was not mistaken, and the sisters of Longchamp remained in possession of the dowry you paid them on entering their home?""",And the sisters at Longchamp have kept the dowry that you paid them when you entered their convent?’,"‘So I was right, and the nuns of Longchamp are still in possession of the dowry you paid when you went there?’"
"Elle ne me suivait point, elle restait à sa place, et elle me disait, en tendant doucement ses deux bras vers moi, et de la voix la plus touchante et la plus douce: «Qu'avez-vous? D'où vient cet effroi? Arrêtez. Je ne suis point Satan, je suis votre supérieure et votre amie.»","She did not follow me, she remained in her place, and she said to me, gently stretching her two arms towards me, and in the most touching and gentle voice: “What is the matter? Where does this fear come from? Stop. I am not Satan, I am your superior and your friend.”","She did not follow me; instead she stayed where she was and said, tenderly stretching her arms out towards me and speaking so very touchingly and softly: ‘What’s wrong? Why are you so frightened? Stop it. I’m not Satan; I’m your Mother Superior and your friend.’","She did not follow me, but stayed where she was, and holding her arms out lovingly said in the most touching and gentle voice: ‘What is upsetting you? Stop. I am not Satan, I am your Superior and your friend.’"
—Non.,-Nope.,‘No.’,‘No.’
J'étais un peu offensée du propos des religieuses; je répondis à la supérieure que cela n'amusait plus les sœurs.,I was a little offended by the nuns' comments; I replied to the superior that it no longer amused the sisters.,"I was a little put out by what the nuns had said, and I told the Mother Superior that the sisters were no longer enjoying my music.","I was a little put out by what the nuns had said, and so I answered the Superior that they were no longer interested."
"—Je vais sortir; craignez mon retour... je m'assieds; je vous donne encore un moment pour vous déterminer... Vos papiers, s'ils existent...","-I'm going out; fear my return... I sit down; I'll give you a moment to make up your mind... Your papers, if they exist...","‘I’m going now, but you should fear my return... No, I’ll sit down and give you another moment to make up your mind... Your papers, if they exist...’","‘I am going out now, beware of my return… No, I will sit down and give you one more moment to make up your mind… Your papers, if they exist –’"
"—Non, monsieur, je n'ignore rien, j'ai deviné mon sort, et j'y suis résignée.","“No, sir, I know nothing, I have guessed my fate, and I am resigned to it.","‘No, Monsieur, I know full well. I’ve guessed what my fate is, and I’m resigned to it.’","‘Yes, Sir, I know everything. I have guessed what my fate is, and I am resigned.’"
Et je présentai mon cou.,And I presented my neck.,And I offered my neck to them.,And I offered my neck.
"Cependant elle avait levé son linge de cou, et avait mis une de mes mains sur sa gorge; elle se taisait, je me taisais aussi; elle paraissait goûter le plus grand plaisir. Elle m'invitait à lui baiser le front, les joues, les yeux et la bouche; et je lui obéissais: je ne crois pas qu'il y eût du mal à cela; cependant son plaisir s'accroissait; et comme je ne demandais pas mieux que d'ajouter à son bonheur d'une manière innocente, je lui baisais encore le front, les joues, les yeux et la bouche. La main qu'elle avait posée sur mon genou se promenait sur tous mes vêtements, depuis l'extrémité de mes pieds jusqu'à ma ceinture, me pressant tantôt dans un endroit, tantôt dans un autre; elle m'exhortait en bégayant, et d'une voix altérée et basse, à redoubler mes caresses, je les redoublais; enfin il vint un moment, je ne sais si ce fut de plaisir ou de peine, où elle devint pâle comme la mort; ses yeux se fermèrent, tout son corps se tendit avec violence, ses lèvres se pressèrent d'abord, elles étaient humectées comme d'une mousse légère; puis sa bouche s'entr'ouvrit, et elle me parut mourir en poussant un profond soupir. Je me levai brusquement; je crus qu'elle se trouvait mal; je voulais sortir, appeler. Elle entr'ouvrit faiblement les yeux, et me dit d'une voix éteinte: «Innocente! ce n'est rien; qu'allez-vous faire? arrêtez...» Je la regardai avec des yeux hébétés, incertaine si je resterais ou si je sortirais. Elle rouvrit encore les yeux; elle ne pouvait plus parler du tout; elle me fit signe d'approcher et de me replacer sur ses genoux. Je ne sais ce qui se passait en moi; je craignais, je tremblais, le cœur me palpitait, j'avais de la peine à respirer, je me sentais troublée, oppressée, agitée, j'avais peur; il me semblait que les forces m'abandonnaient et que j'allais défaillir; cependant je ne saurais dire que ce fût de la peine que je ressentisse. J'allais près d'elle; elle me fit signe encore de la main de m'asseoir sur ses genoux; je m'assis; elle était comme morte, et moi comme si j'allais mourir. Nous demeurâmes assez longtemps l'une et l'autre dans cet état singulier. Si quelque religieuse fût survenue, en vérité elle eût été bien effrayée; elle aurait imaginé, ou que nous nous étions trouvées mal, ou que nous nous étions endormies. Cependant cette bonne supérieure, car il est impossible d'être si sensible et de n'être pas bonne, me parut revenir à elle. Elle était toujours renversée sur sa chaise; ses yeux étaient toujours fermés, mais son visage s'était animé des plus belles couleurs: elle prenait une de mes mains qu'elle baisait, et moi je lui disais: «Ah! chère mère, vous m'avez bien fait peur...» Elle sourit doucement, sans ouvrir les yeux. «Mais est-ce que vous n'avez pas souffert?","However, she had lifted her neckerchief, and had placed one of my hands on her throat; she was silent, I was silent too; she seemed to enjoy the greatest pleasure. She invited me to kiss her forehead, cheeks, eyes and mouth; and I obeyed him: I don't think there was any harm in that; however, his pleasure increased; and as I asked nothing better than to add to his happiness in an innocent way, I kissed his forehead, cheeks, eyes and mouth again. The hand she had placed on my knee wandered over all my clothes, from the end of my feet to my belt, pressing me sometimes in one place, sometimes in another; she urged me, stammering, and in a low, altered voice, to redouble my caresses, I redoubled them; finally there came a moment, I don't know whether it was pleasure or pain, when she became as pale as death; her eyes closed, her whole body tensed violently, her lips pressed together, they were moistened as with a light foam; then her mouth parted, and she seemed to me to die, heaving a deep sigh. I got up abruptly; I thought she was ill; I wanted to go out, call. She half-opened her eyes, and said to me in a faint voice: “Innocent! it's nothing; what are you going to do? stop…” I looked at her with dazed eyes, uncertain whether I would stay or go out. She opened her eyes again; she couldn't speak at all; she motioned for me to come over and get back on her lap. I don't know what was going on inside me; I was afraid, I was shaking, my heart was beating, I had trouble breathing, I felt troubled, oppressed, agitated, I was afraid; it seemed to me that my strength was abandoning me and that I was going to faint; however, I cannot say that it was pain that I felt. I went near her; she again motioned to me to sit down on her lap; I sat down; she was as if dead, and I as if I was going to die. We both remained in this strange state for quite a long time. If any nun had come, she would indeed have been very frightened; she would have imagined either that we were unwell or that we had fallen asleep. However, this good superior, because it is impossible to be so sensitive and not be good, seemed to me to come back to her. She was still leaning back in her chair; her eyes were still closed, but her face had taken on the most beautiful colors: she took one of my hands which she kissed, and I said to her: “Ah! dear mother, you really frightened me...' She smiled softly, without opening her eyes. “But didn't you suffer?","By that point she had lifted up her gimp and had placed one of my hands on her breast. She said nothing, and neither did I. She seemed to be experiencing the most intense pleasure. She would ask me to kiss her forehead, her cheeks, her eyes, and her mouth, and I would obey. I do not think there was anything wrong in doing that. As I did so, her pleasure would increase, and since I wanted nothing more than to add to her happiness in such an innocent way, I would kiss her again on the forehead, the cheeks, the eyes, and the mouth. Her hand, which she had placed on my knee, would now wander up and down all over my clothes, from the tips of my toes to my waist, pressing me here, then there. Stammering and in a faltering, soft voice, she would urge me to caress her even more, and I would do so. Eventually there came a point, and I do not know if this was out of pleasure or pain, when she went deathly pale, her eyes shut, her whole body tensed violently, her lips tightened at first, slightly moistened as if by some kind of foam, then her mouth opened and she gave a deep sigh, as if she was dying. I jumped up , I thought she was unwell, I was going to leave and call for help. She half opened her eyes and said in a faint voice: ‘Innocent one, there’s nothing wrong. What are you doing? Stop...’ I looked at her, with big, dazed eyes, unsure if I would stay or go. She opened her eyes again but could not speak a word. She gestured to me to come over to her and to sit on her knee again. I do not know what was going on inside me. I was afraid, I was trembling, my heart was pounding , I could hardly breathe, I felt anxious, constrained, agitated, I was frightened, I felt as if my strength had drained away and I was about to faint. But I could not say that what I was feeling was pain. I went over to her and again she gestured to me with her hand to sit on her lap; I sat down. It was as if she was dead, as if I was going to die. Both of us remained in this peculiar state for quite some time. If one of the nuns had found us, she would certainly have had quite a fright. She would have thought either that we had been taken ill or that we had fallen asleep. Eventually the good Mother Superior, for it is impossible to be so sensitive and not to be good, seemed to come round. She was still lying back in her chair and her eyes were still shut, but her face had lit up with the loveliest colour. She took hold of one of my hands, kissed it, and I said to her: ‘Oh! Dear Mother, you really scared me...’ She smiled sweetly without opening her eyes. ‘But haven’t you been in pain?’","By now she had raised her collar and put one of my hands on her bosom. She fell silent, and so did I. She seemed to be experiencing the most exquisite pleasure. She invited me to kiss her forehead, cheeks, eyes and mouth, and I obeyed. I don’t think there was any harm in that, but her pleasure increased, and as I was only too glad to add to her happiness in any innocent way, I kissed her again on forehead, cheeks, eyes and lips. The hand she had rested on my knee wandered all over my clothing from my feet to my girdle, pressing here and there, and she gasped as she urged me in a strange, low voice to redouble my caresses, which I did. Eventually a moment came, whether of pleasure or of pain I cannot say, when she went as pale as death, closed her eyes, and her whole body tautened violently, her lips were first pressed together and moistened with a sort of foam, then they parted and she seemed to expire with a deep sigh. I jumped up, thinking she had fainted, and was about to go and call for help. She half opened her eyes and said in a failing voice: ‘You innocent girl! it isn’t anything. What are you doing? Stop…’ I looked at her, wild-eyed and uncertain whether I should stay or go. She opened her eyes again; she had lost her power of speech, and made signs that I should come back and sit on her lap again. I don’t know what was going on inside me , I was afraid, my heart was thumping and I breathed with difficulty, I was upset, oppressed, shocked and frightened, my strength seemed to have left me and I was about to swoon. And yet I cannot say it was pain I was feeling. I went over to her and she once again motioned me to sit on her lap, which I did; she was half dead and I felt as though I were dying myself. We remained in that peculiar state for some time. If a nun had come upon us then she would certainly have been scared and would have imagined either that we had fainted or gone to sleep. However, the good Superior, for it is impossible to be so sensitive and not good, seemed to be recovering. She was still lying back in her chair and her eyes were still closed, but her face was lit up with the loveliest colour. She took one of my hands and kissed it, while I said to her: ‘Dear Mother, you did give me a fright!’ She smiled sweetly without opening her eyes. ‘ But haven’t you been ill?’"

"Je la quittai, j'allai me reposer. L'après-midi, je me rendis chez la supérieure, où je trouvai une assemblée assez nombreuse des religieuses les plus jeunes et les plus jolies de la maison; les autres avaient fait leur visite et s'étaient retirées. Vous qui vous connaissez en peinture, je vous assure, monsieur le marquis, que c'était un assez agréable tableau à voir. Imaginez un atelier de dix à douze personnes, dont la plus jeune pouvait avoir quinze ans, et la plus âgée n'en avait pas vingt-trois; une supérieure qui touchait à la quarantaine, blanche, fraîche, pleine d'embonpoint, à moitié levée sur son lit, avec deux mentons qu'elle portait d'assez bonne grâce, des bras ronds comme s'ils avaient été tournés, des doigts en fuseau, et tout parsemés de fossettes; des yeux noirs, grands, vifs et tendres, presque jamais entièrement ouverts, à demi fermés, comme si celle qui les possédait eût éprouvé quelque fatigue à les ouvrir; des lèvres vermeilles comme la rose, des dents blanches comme le lait, les plus belles joues, une tête fort agréable, enfoncée dans un oreiller profond et mollet; les bras étendus mollement à ses côtés, avec de petits coussins sous les coudes pour les soutenir. J'étais assise sur le bord de son lit, et je ne faisais rien; une autre dans un fauteuil, avec un petit métier à broder sur ses genoux; d'autres, vers les fenêtres, faisaient de la dentelle; il y en avait à terre assises sur les coussins qu'on avait ôtés des chaises, qui cousaient, qui brodaient, qui parfilaient ou qui filaient au petit rouet. Les unes étaient blondes, d'autres brunes; aucune ne se ressemblait, quoiqu'elles fussent toutes belles. Leurs caractères étaient aussi variés que leurs physionomies; celles-ci étaient sereines, celles-là gaies, d'autres sérieuses, mélancoliques ou tristes. Toutes travaillaient, excepté moi, comme je vous l'ai dit. Il n'était pas difficile de discerner les amies des indifférentes et des ennemies; les amies s'étaient placées, ou l'une à côté de l'autre, ou en face; et tout en faisant leur ouvrage, elles causaient, elles se conseillaient, elles se regardaient furtivement, elles se pressaient les doigts, sous prétexte de se donner une épingle, une aiguille, des ciseaux. La supérieure les parcourait des yeux; elle reprochait à l'une son application, à l'autre son oisiveté, à celle-ci son indifférence, à celle-là sa tristesse; elle se faisait apporter l'ouvrage, elle louait ou blâmait; elle raccommodait à l'une son ajustement de tête... «Ce voile est trop avancé... Ce linge prend trop du visage, on ne vous voit pas assez les joues... Voilà des plis qui font mal...» Elle distribuait à chacune, ou de petits reproches, ou de petites caresses.","I left her, I went to rest. In the afternoon, I went to the Superior, where I found a rather numerous assembly of the youngest and prettiest nuns of the house; the others had made their visit and retired. You who are familiar with painting, I assure you, Monsieur le Marquis, that it was quite a pleasant picture to see. Imagine a workshop of ten to twelve people, the youngest of whom might have been fifteen years old, and the oldest not twenty-three; a superior in her forties, white, fresh, full of plumpness, half-raised on her bed, with two chins which she wore rather gracefully, arms round as if they had been turned, fingers tapered, and all dotted with dimples; black eyes, large, lively and tender, almost never entirely open, half closed, as if the one who possessed them had experienced some fatigue in opening them; lips vermilion as a rose, teeth white as milk, the most beautiful cheeks, a very agreeable head, buried in a deep, soft pillow; the arms extended limply at his sides, with small cushions under the elbows to support them. I was sitting on the edge of her bed, doing nothing; another in an armchair, with a small embroidery frame on her lap; others, near the windows, were making lace; there were some sitting on the floor on the cushions that had been removed from the chairs, sewing, embroidering, threading or spinning with a little spinning wheel. Some were blondes, others brunettes; none were alike, although they were all beautiful. Their characters were as varied as their faces; some were serene, some cheerful, others serious, melancholy or sad. All of them were working, except me, as I told you. It was not difficult to distinguish the friends from the indifferent and from the enemies; the friends had taken their places either side by side or opposite each other; and while doing their work, they chatted, they advised each other, they looked at each other furtively, they squeezed their fingers, under the pretext of giving each other a pin, a needle, scissors. The Superior scanned them with her eyes; she reproached one for her application, another for her idleness, this one for her indifference, that one for her sadness; she had the work brought to her, she praised or blamed; she was mending the adjustment of her head to one... ""This veil is too advanced... This linen takes up too much of the face, you can't see your cheeks enough... There are folds that hurt..."" She distributed to each of them either little reproaches or little caresses.","I left her and went to rest. In the afternoon I went to the Mother Superior’s room, where I found quite a large gathering of the convent’s youngest and most beautiful nuns; the others had already made their visit and left. You know about painting, and I can assure you, Monsieur le Marquis, that it was quite a pleasant picture to behold. Imagine a studio with ten to twelve people in it, the youngest of whom was probably fifteen years old, the oldest not yet twenty-three; a Mother Superior, nearly forty, white, fresh, of full figure, sitting up in bed, with a double chin, which she bore quite elegantly, arms as round as if they had been turned on a lathe, slender and dimpled fingers, and big dark eyes, bright and tender, hardly ever wide open, but instead half closed, as if their owner was too weary to open them; rosy-red lips and milk-white teeth, the prettiest cheeks, and a very pleasant head, sunk into a deep soft pillow, her arms lying feebly by her sides, with little cushions supporting her elbows. I was sitting on the edge of her bed, doing nothing. Another nun was in an armchair with a little embroidery frame on her knees. Other nuns were near the windows, making lace; some were sitting on the floor on cushions from the chairs, sewing, embroidering, unpicking threads* or spinning on the little wheel. Some of them had blond hair, others brown. None looked alike, although they were all beautiful. Their characters were as varied as their looks: some were calm, others were cheerful, yet others were serious, melancholy, or sad. They were all doing something, apart from me, as I told you. It was not difficult to distinguish between those nuns who were friends and those who were indifferent to each other or who were enemies. The friends were sitting side by side or facing each other and they were chatting as they did their needlework, giving each other advice, exchanging furtive glances, squeezing each other’s hands as they pretended to hand over a pin, a needle, or a pair of scissors. The Mother Superior glanced at them. She reproached one nun for not applying herself to her work, another for being lazy, another for being indifferent, and another for being sad. She had them bring over their needlework and she would praise it or criticize it. She fixed one nun’s headwear: ‘This veil is too far forward... You’ve covered too much of your face... We can’t see enough of your cheeks... These creases will hurt you...’ She offered everyone a few words of praise or blame.","I left her and went to lie down. In the afternoon I went to the Superior’s room, where I found quite a large gathering of the youngest and prettiest nuns in the convent; the others had paid their respects and departed. You, Sir, who know about painting, can take my word for it that it made a very pleasant picture to look at. Imagine a working party of ten or twelve, the youngest of whom might be fifteen and the oldest not yet twenty-three, a Superior of about forty, white, fresh and plump, sitting up in bed with two chins which she was wearing quite elegantly, arms as round as if they had been turned on a lathe, slender yet dimpled fingers, large black eyes, shining and tender, hardly ever fully open but half closed as though their owner found it rather tiring to open them , lips rosy-red and teeth as white as milk, lovely cheeks and a very handsome head half buried in a deep, soft pillow, her arms spread nonchalantly along her sides, with little cushions supporting each elbow. I was sitting on the edge of her bed doing nothing, but another nun was in an armchair with a little embroidery frame on her knees, while others sat near the windows, making lace. Some were sitting on the floor on cushions taken from the chairs, sewing, embroidering, unpicking embroideries or spinning on a little wheel. Some fair, some dark, they were all different but all beautiful, and their characters were as varied as their faces, for some were placid and others gay, others again were serious, melancholy or sad. Everybody was at work except myself, as I have said. It was not difficult to see who were friends, who meant nothing to each other or were enemies; the friends were either side by side or opposite each other, and while working they chatted and exchanged advice, looked furtively at each other and linked their fingers on the pretext of giving each other a pin, needle or scissors. The Superior continually ran her eye over them, reproved one for working too hard and another for not getting on, another for her indifference or another for being sad; she had the work brought to her and praised or criticized it, readjusted the headgear of one of them: ‘This veil comes too far forward… This linen hides too much of your face and we can’t see enough of your cheeks… These folds don’t fall properly …’ And each one had her little penalty or little rewarding caress."
"Elle fut saignée: on lui donna les bains; mais son mal semblait s'accroître par les remèdes. Je n'ose vous décrire toutes les actions indécentes qu'elle fit, vous répéter tous les discours malhonnêtes qui lui échappèrent dans son délire. À tout moment elle portait la main à son front, comme pour en écarter des idées importunes, des images, que sais-je quelles images! Elle se renfonçait la tête dans son lit, elle se couvrait le visage de ses draps. «C'est le tentateur, disait-elle, c'est lui! Quelle forme bizarre il a prise! Prenez de l'eau bénite; jetez de l'eau bénite sur moi... Cessez, cessez; il n'y est plus.»","She was bled: they gave her baths; but his illness seemed to be increased by the remedies. I dare not describe to you all the indecent actions she did, repeat to you all the dishonest speeches which escaped her in her delirium. At all times she raised her hand to her forehead, as if to brush away importunate ideas, images, who knows what images! She buried her head in her bed, she covered her face with her sheets. ""It's the tempter,"" she would say, ""it's him!"" What a bizarre form it took! Take holy water; throw holy water on me... Cease, cease; it is no longer there.”","She was bled and bathed, but each treatment seemed to make her illness worse. I dare not describe for you all the indecent things she did, nor repeat all the obscene things that escaped from her mouth in her delirium. She kept on putting her hand up to her forehead as if she was trying to get rid of troublesome ideas and images, goodness knows what images! She buried her head in the bed and covered her face with the sheets. ‘It’s the devil,’ she said, ‘it’s him. How strange he looks! Get some holy water; sprinkle some holy water on me... Stop, stop, he’s gone now.’","She was bled, she was given baths, but her malady seemed worsened by remedies. I dare not describe all the indecent things she did and said in her delirium. She kept on putting her hand to her forehead as though trying to drive away unwanted thoughts or visions – what visions I don’t know. She buried her head in the bed and covered her face with her sheets. ‘It is the tempter!’ she cried, ‘it is he! What a strange shape he has put on! Get some holy water and sprinkle it over me… Stop, stop, he’s gone now.’"
