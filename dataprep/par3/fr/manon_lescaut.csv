"Ces réflexions me pénétraient de douleur ; mais ce n’était rien en comparaison de celles qui regardaient l’avenir car je séchais de crainte pour Manon. Elle avait déjà été à l’Hôpital, et, quand elle en fût sortie par la bonne porte, je savais que les rechutes en ce genre étaient d’une conséquence extrêmement dangereuse. J’aurais voulu lui exprimer mes frayeurs ; j’appréhendais de lui en causer trop. Je tremblais pour elle, sans oser l’avertir du danger et je l’embrassais en soupirant, pour l’assurer du moins, de mon amour qui était presque le seul sentiment que j’osasse exprimer.","These reflections filled me with pain; but it was nothing compared to those who looked to the future because I was drying up with fear for Manon. She had already been in the Hospital, and when she came out of it by the right door, I knew that relapses of this kind were of an extremely dangerous consequence. I would have liked to express my fears to him; I was afraid to cause him too much. I trembled for her, without daring to warn her of the danger and I kissed her with a sigh, to assure her at least of my love which was almost the only feeling I dared to express.","Such thoughts as these filled my heart with grief. But that was nothing beside my forebodings for the future, whilst fear for Manon withered my very soul. She had already been an inmate of the Hôpital, and, even if she had left that institution by the front door, I knew that further offences of the same kind would entail extremely dangerous consequences. I would have liked to confide my fears to her, but was frightened of passing on too much of them to her. I trembled for her but dared not warn her of her peril, and I held her in my arms and sighed so as to convince her at least of my love, for love was almost the only sentiment I dared express.","""These feelings filled me with grief; but it was bliss compared with my prospects for the future.   My fear, on account of Manon, knew no bounds.   She had already been an inmate of the Magdalen; and even if she had left it by fair means, I knew that a relapse of this nature would be attended with disastrous consequences.   I wished to let her know my fears: I was apprehensive of exciting hers.   I trembled for her, without daring to put her on her guard against the danger; and I embraced her tenderly, to satisfy her, at least, of my love, which was almost the only sentiment to which I dared to give expression.

"– Laissez, laissez, répondis-je en sortant ; je vous reverrai plus tôt que vous ne pensez. Préparez-moi le plus noir de vos cachots ; je vais travailler à le mériter.","“Leave, leave,” I answered, going out; I'll see you sooner than you think. Prepare for me the blackest of your dungeons; I will work to earn it.","‘Oh, never mind that ,’ I said as I left him, ‘I shall be seeing you again sooner than you think. Get ready the blackest of your dungeons, for I am going to do my best to deserve it.’","`Do not stop me,' said I, as I went out; `we shall meet again sooner than you imagine: get ready your darkest dungeon, for I shall shortly become its tenant.'"
"Je montrai ce billet à Manon, et je lui appris de quelle ruse je m’étais servi pour m’introduire librement chez elle. Mon invention et celle de M. de T... lui parurent admirables. Nous en rîmes à notre aise pendant quelques moments. Mais, lorsque je lui parlai de la dernière comme d’un badinage, je fus surpris qu’elle insistât sérieusement à me la proposer comme une chose dont l’idée la ravissait. En vain lui demandai-je où elle voulait que je trouvasse, tout d’un coup, des gens propres à arrêter G... M... et à le garder fidèlement. Elle me dit qu’il fallait du moins tenter, puisque M. de T... nous garantissait encore une heure, et pour réponse à mes autres objections, elle me dit que je faisais le tyran et que je n’avais pas de complaisance pour elle. Elle ne trouvait rien de si joli que ce projet.","I showed this note to Manon, and told her what trick I had used to get into her house freely. My invention and that of M. de T... seemed to him admirable. We laughed at it for a few moments. But when I told her of the latter as a joke, I was surprised that she seriously insisted on offering it to me as something the idea of which delighted her. In vain did I ask her where she wanted me to find, all of a sudden, people capable of arresting G... M... and keeping him faithfully. She told me that we should at least try, since M. de T... guaranteed us another hour, and in response to my other objections, she told me that I was playing the tyrant and that I had no complaisance. for her. She couldn't think of anything so pretty as this project.","I showed this note to Manon and explained to her the trick I had used in order to gain free admission into her house. She was vastly amused by my ingenuity and M. de T.’s, and we gave ourselves up to a few minutes of uncontrolled merriment.

In vain did I ask where she expected I could find, all of a sudden, men who could waylay G. M. and hold him in safe custody. She said that I might at least try, since M. de T. guaranteed us another hour, and when I raised further objections she accused me of being tyrannical and having no consideration for her. She thought it was the prettiest plan in the world: ‘You will have his place at supper, sleep between his sheets and early tomorrow carry off his mistress and his money.","""I showed the note to Manon; I told her at the same time of the manner in which I had procured the interview with her.   My scheme, as well as the new one of M. de T----'s, delighted her: we laughed heartily at it for some minutes; but when I treated it as a mere joke, I was surprised at her insisting seriously upon it, as a thing perfectly practicable, and too delightful to be neglected.   In vain I enquired where she thought I could possibly find, on a sudden, men fit for such an adventure? and on whom I could rely for keeping G---- M---- in strict custody?   She said that I should at least try, as M. de T---- ensured us yet a full hour; and as to my other objections, she said that I was playing the tyrant, and did not show the slightest indulgence to her fancies.

"– Ce n’est pas, monsieur, répondit-il d’un air embarrassé, que nous refusions de le laisser parler à cette fille, mais il voudrait être sans cesse auprès d’elle ; cela nous est incommode ; il est bien juste qu’il paie pour l’incommodité.","'It is not, sir,' he replied with an embarrassed air, 'that we refuse to let him speak to that girl, but he would like to be with her constantly; it is inconvenient for us; it is only fair that he should pay for the inconvenience.","‘You see, Sir,’ he managed to stammer out, ‘it isn’t as though we refuse to let him talk to his girl, but he wants to be with her all the time, and that is a nuisance that ought to be paid for.","""It is not, sir,"" said he, in an embarrassed tone, ""that we refuse to let him speak to the girl, but he wishes to be always near her, which puts us to inconvenience; and it is just that we should be paid for the trouble he occasions."

"À mon réveil, Manon me déclara que, pour passer le jour dans notre appartement, elle ne prétendait pas que j’en eusse l’air plus négligé, et qu’elle voulait que mes cheveux fussent accommodés de ses propres mains. Je les avais fort beaux. C’était un amusement qu’elle s’était donné plusieurs fois ; mais elle y apporta plus de soins que je ne lui en avais jamais vu prendre. Je fus obligé, pour la satisfaire, de m’asseoir devant sa toilette, et d’essuyer toutes les petites recherches qu’elle imagina pour ma parure. Dans le cours de son travail, elle me faisait tourner souvent le visage vers elle, et s’appuyant des deux mains sur mes épaules, elle me regardait avec une curiosité avide. Ensuite, exprimant sa satisfaction par un ou deux baisers, elle me faisait reprendre ma situation pour continuer son ouvrage. Ce badinage nous occupa jusqu’à l’heure du dîner. Le goût qu’elle y avait pris m’avait paru si naturel, et sa gaieté sentait si peu l’artifice, que ne pouvant concilier des apparences si constantes avec le projet d’une noire trahison, je fus tenté plusieurs fois de lui ouvrir mon cœur et de me décharger d’un fardeau qui commençait à me peser. Mais je me flattais, à chaque instant, que l’ouverture viendrait d’elle, et je m’en faisais d’avance un délicieux triomphe.","When I woke up, Manon told me that, to spend the day in our apartment, she did not claim that I would look more neglected, and that she wanted my hair to be done with her own hands. I had them very nice. It was an amusement she had given herself several times; but she took more care in it than I had ever seen her take. I was obliged, to satisfy her, to sit down in front of her toilet, and to undergo all the little researches she imagined for my finery. In the course of her work, she often made me turn my face towards her, and leaning with both hands on my shoulders, she looked at me with avid curiosity. Then, expressing her satisfaction with one or two kisses, she made me resume my situation to continue her work. This banter occupied us until dinner time. The taste she had taken for it seemed to me so natural, and her gaiety smacked so little of artifice, that not being able to reconcile such constant appearances with the project of black treason, I was tempted several times to open to her my heart and to relieve me of a burden that was beginning to weigh on me. But I flattered myself, every moment, that the overture would come from her, and I made myself a delicious triumph in advance.","When I woke up Manon informed me that by spending the day at home she did not mean that she wanted me to look slovenly, and she proposed to dress my hair with her own hands. I had a very fine head of hair and she had often amused herself in this way. But this time she took more care over the task than I had ever known her take before. To satisfy her, I had to sit in front of her dressing-table and submit to every little device she could think of for my embellishment. As she worked she frequently turned my face towards her, put her hands on my shoulders and scrutinized me with hungry eyes; then, expressing her satisfaction with a kiss or two, she would turn me round again and go on. This dalliance kept us busy until dinner-time. She had seemed so genuinely interested in it, and her gaiety smacked so little of artifice, that I was quite unable to make such apparent devotion tally with any intent to deceive me in so foul a manner. More than once I was tempted to open my heart to her and unburden myself of a load that was beginning to weigh me down, but each moment I flattered myself that the initiative would come from her, and promised myself the delights of a triumph.","""When I awoke in the morning, Manon said to me, that although we were to pass the day at home, she did not at all wish that I should be less carefully dressed than on other occasions; and that she had a particular fancy for doing the duties of my toilette that morning with her own hands.   It was an amusement she often indulged in: but she appeared to take more pains on this occasion than I had ever observed before.   To gratify her, I was obliged to sit at her toilette table, and try all the different modes she imagined for dressing my hair.   In the course of the operation, she made me often turn my head round towards her, and putting both hands upon my shoulders, she would examine me with most anxious curiosity: then, showing her approbation by one or two kisses, she would make me resume my position before the glass, in order to continue her occupation. ""This amatory trifling engaged us till dinner-time.   The pleasure she seemed to derive from it, and her more than usual gaiety, appeared to me so thoroughly natural, that I found it impossible any longer to suspect the treason I had previously conjured up; and I was several times on the point of candidly opening my mind to her, and throwing off a load that had begun to weigh heavily upon my heart: but I flattered myself with the hope that the explanation would every moment come from herself, and I anticipated the delicious triumph this would afford me."

He had loaded her with gifts and held out before her the fortune of a queen. Notwithstanding, she did not forget me in her grand new surroundings, so she assured me, but as she had not been able to persuade G. M. to take her to the Comedy she had had to postpone the pleasure of seeing me until another day. But to make up a little for the disappointment she foresaw this news might give me, she had managed to procure me one of the prettiest girls in Paris, who was the bearer of her letter. Signed: Your faithful love, Manon Lescaut.","G---- M---- had received her with a politeness and magnificence beyond anything she had previously conceived.

"J’attendis le retour du père avec toutes les agitations d’un malheureux qui touche au moment de sa sentence. C’était pour moi un supplice inexprimable de me représenter Manon à l’Hôpital. Outre l’infamie de cette demeure, j’ignorais de quelle manière elle y était traitée, et le souvenir de quelques particularités que j’avais entendues de cette maison d’horreur renouvelait à tous moments mes transports. J’étais tellement résolu de la secourir à quelque prix et par quelque moyen que ce pût être, que j’aurais mis le feu à Saint-Lazare, s’il m’eût été impossible d’en sortir autrement. Je réfléchis donc sur les voies que j’avais à prendre, s’il arrivait que le lieutenant général de police continuât de m’y retenir malgré moi. Je mis mon industrie à toutes les épreuves ; je parcourus toutes les possibilités. Je ne vis rien qui pût m’assurer d’une évasion certaine, et je craignis d’être renfermé plus étroitement si je faisais une tentative malheureuse. Je me rappelai le nom de quelques amis, de qui je pouvais espérer du secours ; mais quel moyen de leur faire savoir ma situation ? Enfin, je crus avoir formé un plan si adroit qu’il pourrait réussir et je remis à l’arranger encore mieux après le retour du père supérieur, si l’inutilité de sa démarche me le rendait nécessaire. Il ne tarda point à revenir. Je ne vis pas, sur son visage, les marques de joie qui accompagnent une bonne nouvelle.","I awaited the father's return with all the agitation of a wretch approaching the moment of his sentence. It was an inexpressible torture for me to imagine Manon at the hospital. Besides the infamy of this house, I did not know how it was treated there, and the memory of some particulars which I had heard of this house of horror renewed my transports at all times. I was so determined to help her at whatever cost and by whatever means it might be, that I would have set fire to Saint-Lazare, if it had been impossible for me to get out of it otherwise. So I reflected on the paths I had to take, if it happened that the Lieutenant General of Police continued to keep me there in spite of myself. I put my industry to all tests; I explored all the possibilities. I saw nothing that could assure me of a certain escape, and I feared to be confined more closely if I made an unsuccessful attempt. I remembered the names of some friends from whom I could hope for help; but what means of letting them know my situation? Finally, I thought I had formed a plan so adroit that it might succeed, and I resumed arranging it still better after the return of the Father Superior, if the uselessness of his step made it necessary for me. It was not long before he returned. I didn't see the signs of joy on his face that come with good news.","I waited for his return with all the apprehension of a poor wretch whose sentence is about to be pronounced. It was an indescribable torture to imagine Manon at the Hôpital. Apart from the disgrace of her being there at all, there was my ignorance of what sort of treatment she was receiving, while recollections of the few details I had heard about that horrible place constantly revived my anxieties. I was so determined to help her, at any cost and by any means, that I would have set fire to Saint-Lazare if it had not been possible to get out by any other method. And so I pondered over the ways open to me if the Lieutenant-General of Police persisted in keeping me there by force. I cudgelled my brains and explored every possibility, but I could find nothing that would guarantee a certain escape, and was afraid of having the watch on me tightened still more if I made an unsuccessful attempt. I went over the names of friends from whom I might expect assistance, but how could I let them know about my predicament? In the end I thought I had settled on a plan so skilful that it could hardly fail, and I decided to postpone improving on it until the Father Superior’s return and the fruitlessness of his errand had made it necessary. He soon came back, and his expression bore none of the signs of joy that one associates with good news.","""I looked for the good Father's return with all the suspense of a man expecting sentence of death.   It was torture to me to think of Manon at the Magdalen.   Besides the infamy of such a prison, I knew not how she might be treated there; and the recollection of some particulars I had formerly heard of this horrible place, incessantly renewed my misery.   Cost what it might , I was so bent upon relieving her by some means or other, that I should assuredly have set fire to St. Lazare, if no other mode of escape had presented itself. ""I considered what chances would remain to me if the lieutenant- general still kept me in confinement.   I taxed my ingenuity: I scanned every imaginable gleam of hope--I could discover nothing that gave me any prospect of escape, and I feared that I should experience only more rigid confinement, if I made an unsuccessful attempt.   I thought of some friends from whom I might hope for aid, but then, how was I to make them aware of my situation?   At length I fancied that I had hit upon a plan so ingenious, as to offer a fair probability of success.   I postponed the details of its arrangement until after the Superior's return, in case of his having failed in the object of his visit. ""He soon arrived: I did not observe upon his countenance any of those marks of joy that indicate good news.  "
Je ne répondis rien. Il continua :,I didn't answer. He continued :,"I made no answer. He went on: ‘How a father is to be pitied when, having tenderly loved his son and spared no pains to make a good man of him, all he finds in the end is a rogue who dishonours him!","""I made no reply.  "

"Je fis un moment de réflexion sur ce parti, mais, ne voyant de tous côtés que des sujets de désespoir, je pris une résolution véritablement désespérée.

He is so gentle, moreover, and so honest, that I find it hard to understand why he went to such excess without strong reasons.","‘ No, Sir,’ said the Superior, ‘we cannot treat a person of the Chevalier’s rank in such a manner. Besides, he is so gentle and well-behaved that I find it difficult to believe that he has gone to such lengths without strong provocation.’","said the governor, `it is not with a person of his birth that we are in the habit of using such means of coercion; besides, he is habitually so mild and well-conducted, that I cannot but think you must have given provocation for such excessive violence.'

"» Voilà, ajouta Manon, de quelle manière les choses se sont passées. Je ne vous déguise rien, ni de ma conduite, ni de mes desseins.

J’aurais été ravie de pouvoir vous envoyer Marcel, mais je n’ai pu me procurer un moment pour l’instruire de ce que j’avais à vous faire savoir.","That's, added Manon, how things happened. I disguise nothing from you, neither of my conduct nor of my intentions.

I would have been delighted to be able to send Marcel to you, but I could not find a moment to inform him of what I had to let you know.","And that,’ Manon concluded, ‘is how things happened. I am keeping nothing back, either of what I did or of what I proposed to do. The girl came, she struck me as pretty and, as I felt sure that my absence would make you unhappy, I was quite sincere in wishing that she might alleviate a little of your boredom, for the fidelity I expect of you is that of the heart. I would have been only too glad to send you Marcel, but I could not find a single moment to tell him what I wanted you to know.’","""`This is the history,' said Manon, `of the entire affair.   I conceal nothing from you, of either my conduct or my intentions.   The girl arrived; I thought her handsome; and as I doubted not that you would be mortified by my absence, I did most sincerely hope that she would be able to dissipate something of your ennui: for it is the fidelity of the heart alone that I value.   I should have been too delighted to have sent Marcel, but I could not for a single instant find an opportunity of telling him what I wished to communicate to you.'  "

"G... M... était plus fin que son père ; il voulait tenir sa proie avant que de compter ses espèces. Nous délibérâmes sur la conduite que Manon avait à tenir. Je fis encore des efforts pour lui ôter cette entreprise de la tête et je lui en représentai tous les dangers. Rien ne fut capable d’ébranler sa résolution. Elle fit une courte réponse à G... M..., pour l’assurer qu’elle ne trouverait pas de difficulté à se rendre à Paris le jour marqué, et qu’il pouvait l’attendre avec certitude. Nous réglâmes ensuite que je partirais sur-le-champ pour aller louer un nouveau logement dans quelque village, de l’autre côté de Paris, et que je transporterais avec moi notre petit équipage ; que le lendemain après-midi, qui était le temps de son assignation, elle se rendrait de bonne heure à Paris ; qu’après avoir reçu les présents de G... M..., elle le prierait instamment de la conduire à la Comédie ; qu’elle prendrait avec elle tout ce qu’elle pourrait porter de la somme, et qu’elle chargerait du reste mon valet, qu’elle voulait mener avec elle. C’était toujours le même qui l’avait délivrée de l’Hôpital, et qui nous était infiniment attaché. Je devais me trouver avec un fiacre, à l’entrée de la rue Saint-André-des-Arcs, et l’y laisser vers les sept heures, pour m’avancer dans l’obscurité à la porte de la Comédie. Manon me promettait d’inventer des prétextes pour sortir un instant de sa loge, et de l’employer à descendre pour me rejoindre. L’exécution du reste était facile. Nous aurions regagné mon fiacre en un moment, et nous serions sortis de Paris par le faubourg Saint-Antoine, qui était le chemin de notre nouvelle demeure.","G... M... was shrewder than his father; he wanted to hold his prey before counting his species. We deliberated on what Manon should do. I made further efforts to get this enterprise out of his head and I pointed out to him all the dangers. Nothing was able to shake his resolve. She made a short answer to G... M..., to assure him that she would find no difficulty in going to Paris on the appointed day, and that he could wait for her with certainty. We then arranged that I would leave immediately to rent a new lodging in some village on the other side of Paris, and that I would take our little crew with me; that the following afternoon, which was the time of her summons, she would go early to Paris; that after having received the presents of G... M..., she would beg him earnestly to take her to the Comédie; that she would take with her all that she could carry of the sum, and that she would charge my valet with the rest, whom she wanted to take with her. It was still the same man who had delivered her from the Hospital, and who was infinitely attached to us. I was to find myself with a cab at the entrance to the Rue Saint-André-des-Arcs, and leave it there about seven o'clock, to advance in the darkness to the Porte de la Comédie. Manon promised me to invent pretexts to get out of her box for a moment, and to use her to come down to join me. Performing the rest was easy. We would have returned to my cab in a moment, and we would have left Paris by the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was the road to our new home.","G. M. was sharper than his father. He meant to have his bird in hand before counting out his money. We discussed what line Manon was to take, and once again I did everything I could to get her to put the scheme out of her mind, pointing out all the risks; but nothing could shake her determination. She wrote a short note to G. M., assuring him that she would have no trouble in going to Paris on the day in question and that he could confidently expect her. We then settled that I was to go at once and take new lodgings in some village on the far side of Paris, and move our few belongings with me. The following afternoon, that is to say on the day of her assignation, she should go in good time to Paris, and after receiving G. M.’s presents beg him to take her to the Comedy; she should take on her person as much of the money as she could carry and entrust the rest to my valet, whom she proposed to take with her. This was the same man who helped her to escape from the Hôpital, and he was devoted to us both. I was to have a cab ready at the corner of the Rue Saint-André-des-Arts, and at about seven o’clock leave it there and proceed under cover of darkness into the doorway of the theatre. Manon promised to make some excuse for leaving her box for a minute, and she would use that minute to come down and join me. The rest would be easy. In a trice we should get back to my cab and leave Paris by the Faubourg Saint-Antoine through which lay the road to our new home.","""G---- M---- the younger was more cunning than the old gentleman.   He wanted to secure his prey before he counted out the cash.   We considered what course Manon should adopt.   I made another effort to induce her to give up the scheme, and strongly represented all its dangers; nothing, however, could shake her determination. ""Her answer to G---- M---- was brief, merely assuring him that she could be, without the least difficulty, in Paris on the appointed day and that he might expect her with certainty. ""We then resolved, that I should instantly hire lodgings in some village on the other side of Paris, and that I should take our luggage with me; that in the afternoon of the following day, which was the time appointed, she should go to Paris; that, after receiving G---- M----'s presents, she should earnestly entreat him to take her to the theatre; that she should carry with her as large a portion of the money as she could, and charge my servant with the remainder, for it was agreed that he was to accompany her.   He was the man who had rescued her from the Magdalen, and he was devotedly attached to us.   I was to be with a hackney-coach at the end of the street of St. Andre-des-arcs, and to leave it there about seven o'clock, while I stole, under cover of the twilight, to the door of the theatre.   Manon promised to make some excuse for quitting her box for a moment, when she would come down and join me.   The rest could be easily done.   We were then to return to my hackney-coach, and quit Paris by the Faubourg St. Antoine, which was the road to our new residence."
"– Rassurez-vous, messieurs, leur dis-je, en les abordant ; je ne vous apporte point la guerre, je viens vous demander des grâces.","""Reassure yourself, gentlemen,"" I said to them, approaching them; I do not bring you war, I come to ask you for graces.","‘Gentlemen,’ I said as I came up to them, ‘rest assured, I do not bring war, but come to ask favours.’","`Be persuaded, gentlemen,' said I to them, `that I come not to wage war, but rather to ask favours.'

"Il était six heures du soir. On vint m’avertir, un moment après mon retour, qu’une dame demandait à me voir. J’allai au parloir sur-le-champ. Dieux ! quelle apparition surprenante ! j’y trouvai Manon. C’était elle, mais plus aimable et plus brillante que je ne l’avais jamais vue. Elle était dans sa dix-huitième année. Ses charmes surpassaient tout ce qu’on peut décrire. C’était un air si fin, si doux, si engageant, l’air de l’Amour même. Toute sa figure me parut un enchantement.","It was six o'clock in the evening. They came to tell me, a moment after my return, that a lady wanted to see me. I went to the parlor immediately. Gods ! what a surprising appearance! I found Manon there. It was her, but kinder and brighter than I had ever seen her. She was in her eighteenth year. Her charms surpassed anything that can be described. It was such a fine tune, so sweet, so engaging, the tune of Love itself. His whole face seemed to me an enchantment.","At six o’clock I returned to Saint-Sulpice, covered with glory and complimented on all sides. A moment after I had got back I was told that a lady was asking to see me and I went straight to the parlour. God! What did I see? Manon herself. Manon, more dazzlingly beautiful than I had ever known her. She was not yet eighteen and her loveliness was then beyond description. Such gentle grace, yet at the same time such vivacity and subtle charm – she looked like the incarnation of love itself. Every line of her face was enchanting.","It was six in the evening.   The moment I returned, a lady was announced, who desired to speak with me.   I went to meet her.   Heavens! what a surprise! It was Manon.   It was she indeed, but more bewitching and brilliant than I had ever beheld her.   She was now in her eighteenth year.   Her beauty beggars all description.   The exquisite grace of her form, the mild sweetness of expression that animated her features, and her engaging air, made her seem the very personification of love.   The vision was something too perfect for human beauty. ""I stood like one enchanted at beholding her.  "
"– Non, disais-je, il n’a pas gagné le cœur de Manon, il lui a fait violence ; il l’a séduite par un charme ou par un poison ; il l’a peut-être forcée brutalement. Manon m’aime.

Manon loves me. Don't I know it well? He will have threatened her, dagger in hand, to force her to abandon me. What will he not have done to rob me of such a charming mistress! O gods! gods ! Could it be that Manon had betrayed me, and that she had ceased to love me!","‘ No,’ I said, ‘he has never won her love; he has forced her to it; he has seduced her by some charm or even drug; he may have violated her. Manon loves me, I am certain of that. He must have threatened her at the dagger’s point to make her give me up. Oh God! could it be possible that Manon betrayed me or has ceased to care for me?’","`No!'cried I; `he has not gained Manon's heart; he may have seduced her by charms, or by drugs; he may have even brutally violated her.   Manon loves me.   Do I not know that well?   He must have terrified her with a poniard, to induce her to abandon me.'   What must he not have done to have robbed me of my angelic mistress?   Oh Heaven!   Heaven! can it be possible that Manon deceived me, or that she has ceased to love me!"

"– Ah ! Manon, Manon, repris-je avec un soupir il est bien tard de me donner des larmes, lorsque vous avez causé ma mort. Vous affectez une tristesse que vous ne sauriez sentir.

"Lorsque je me trouvai muni de l’instrument de ma liberté, je ne doutai presque plus du succès de mon projet. Il était bizarre et hardi ; mais de quoi n’étais-je pas capable, avec les motifs qui m’animaient ? J’avais remarqué, depuis qu’il m’était permis de sortir de ma chambre et de me promener dans les galeries, que le portier apportait chaque jour au soir les clefs de toutes les portes au supérieur et qu’il régnait ensuite un profond silence dans la maison, qui marquait que tout le monde était retiré. Je pouvais aller sans obstacle, par une galerie de communication, de ma chambre à celle de ce père. Ma résolution était de lui prendre ses clefs, en l’épouvantant avec mon pistolet s’il faisait difficulté de me les donner et de m’en servir pour gagner la rue. J’en attendis le temps avec impatience. Le portier vint à l’heure ordinaire, c’est-à-dire un peu après neuf heures. J’en laissai passer encore une, pour m’assurer que tous les religieux et les domestiques étaient endormis. Je partis enfin, avec mon arme et une chandelle allumée. Je frappai d’abord doucement à la porte du père, pour l’éveiller sans bruit. Il m’entendit au second coup, et s’imaginant, sans doute, que c’était quelque religieux qui se trouvait mal et qui avait besoin de secours, il se leva pour m’ouvrir.

I could go without obstacle, by a connecting gallery, from my room to that of this father. My resolution was to take his keys from him, terrifying him with my pistol if he had any difficulty in giving them to me and using them to reach the street. I waited impatiently for the time. The porter came at the usual time, that is to say a little after nine o'clock. I let one more pass, to make sure that all the monks and servants were asleep. I finally left, with my gun and a lit candle. At first I knocked softly on the father's door, to wake him quietly. He heard me at the second knock, and imagining, no doubt, that it was some monk who was ill and who needed help, he rose to open the door.

There was nothing to prevent my passing from my room to his through the communicating gallery. My object was to get the keys from the Superior by threatening him with the pistol if he showed signs of refusing, after which I would use them to gain the street.

"– C’est, lui dis-je, de le faire approuver du Ciel. Nous avons l’âme trop belle, et le cœur trop bien fait, l’un et l’autre, pour vivre volontairement dans l’oubli du devoir. Passe d’y avoir vécu en France, où il nous était également impossible de cesser de nous aimer et de nous satisfaire par une voie légitime ; mais en Amérique, où nous ne dépendons que de nous-mêmes, où nous n’avons plus à ménager les lois arbitraires du rang et de la bienséance, où l’on nous croit même mariés, qui empêche que nous ne le soyons bientôt effectivement et que nous n’anoblissions notre amour par des serments que la religion autorise ? Pour moi, ajoutai-je, je ne vous offre rien de nouveau en vous offrant mon cœur et ma main, mais je suis prêt à vous en renouveler le don au pied d’un autel.","– It is, I told him, to have it approved by Heaven.

As for me, I added, I offer you nothing new by offering you my heart and my hand, but I am ready to renew the gift to you at the foot of an altar.","I pointed out that our happiness lacked one thing only: the blessing of Heaven. ‘We are both too sound in heart and soul,’ I said, ‘to go on living in defiance of our duty. It is true that we did so in France, where it was equally impossible for us to give up loving each other and to satisfy our love in a lawful way; but here in America, with nobody to depend on but ourselves and no further obligation to observe the arbitrary laws of social standing and public opinion, where indeed we are thought to be married, what is there to prevent our being so in fact, and purifying our love by the vows authorized by the Church? For my part, I am not offering you anything new when I give you my heart and hand, but I am prepared to renew that gift at the altar.’","but one thing wanting to complete our happiness: `it is,' said I, `to invoke upon our union the benediction of Heaven.   We have both of us hearts too sensitive and minds too refined, to continue voluntarily in the wilful violation of so sacred a duty.   It signifies nothing our having lived while in France in such a manner, because there it was as impossible for us not to love, as to be united by a legitimate tie: but in America, where we are under no restraint, where we owe no allegiance to the arbitrary distinctions of birth and aristocratic prejudice, where besides we are already supposed to be married, why should we not actually become so --why should we not sanctify our love by the holy ordinances of religion?

Enfin, comme je demeurais dans le silence, il continua de me dire que, suivant le calcul qu’il pouvait faire du temps depuis mon départ d’Amiens, Manon m’avait aimé environ douze jours : « car ajouta-t-il, je sais que tu partis d’Amiens le 28 de l’autre mois ; nous sommes au 29 du présent ; il y en a onze que M. B... m’a écrit ; je suppose qu’il lui en a fallu huit pour lier une parfaite connaissance avec ta maîtresse ; ainsi, qui ôte onze et huit de trente-un jours qu’il y a depuis le 28 d’un mois jusqu’au 29 de l’autre, reste douze, un peu plus ou moins ».","He added a thousand railleries of this strength, on what he called my stupidity and my credulity. Finally, as I remained silent, he continued to tell me that, according to the calculation he could make of the time since my departure from Amiens, Manon had loved me for about twelve days: ""because he added, I know that you left Amiens on the 28th of the other month; we are at the 29th of the present; there are eleven that M. B... wrote to me; I suppose it took him eight to form a perfect acquaintance with your mistress; thus, whoever takes away eleven and eight from thirty-one days that there are from the 28th of one month to the 29th of the other, remains twelve, a little more or less”.","And he added various other witticisms in the same style on what he called my silly credulity. As I made no attempt to speak, he went on to say that, according to calculations he had made, Manon had loved me for about twelve days after our departure from Amiens. ‘I know,’ he said, ‘that you left Amiens on the 28th of last month. It is now the 29th of this month. It is eleven days since M. de. B. wrote to me. Let us suppose it took him eight days to get to know your lady friend properly. So if we take eleven and eight from the thirty-one between the 28th of last month and the 29th of this, we get twelve, or thereabouts.’ More roars of laughter.","He continued in the same tone to ridicule what he was pleased to call my dullness and credulity. ""He concluded, while I maintained a profound silence, by saying that, according to the nicest calculation he could make of the time since my departure from Amiens, Manon must have been in love with me about twelve days; `for,' said he, `I know that you left Amiens on the 28th of last month; this is, the 29th of the present; it is eleven days since M. de B---- wrote to me; I suppose he required eight days to establish a perfect understanding with your mistress; so that, take eight and eleven from thirty-one days, the time between the 28th of one month and the 29th of the next, there remains twelve, more or less!'

"– Elles sont bien incertaines, lui dis-je, mais la plus solide et la plus consolante pour moi est celle de périr du moins dans l’entreprise.","“They are very uncertain,” I said to him, “but the most solid and the most consoling for me is that of perishing at least in the enterprise.","So the only way left open to me was brute force along the lines sketched out by M. de T., and I concentrated all my hopes on that. ‘Such hopes are very precarious,’ I conceded, ‘but the best-founded one, and the most comforting to me, is that at least I may perish in the attempt.’","They were questionless most uncertain; but they held out to me, at least, a substantial consolation, in the certainty of meeting death in the attempt, if unsuccessful.

"Je demeurai, après cette lecture, dans un état qui me serait difficile à décrire car j’ignore encore aujourd’hui par quelle espèce de sentiments je fus alors agité. Ce fut une de ces situations uniques auxquelles on n’a rien éprouvé qui soit semblable. On ne saurait les expliquer aux autres, parce qu’ils n’en ont pas l’idée ; et l’on a peine à se les bien démêler à soi-même, parce qu’étant seules de leur espèce, cela ne se lie à rien dans la mémoire, et ne peut même être rapproché d’aucun sentiment connu. Cependant, de quelque nature que fussent les miens, il est certain qu’il devait y entrer de la douleur, du dépit, de la jalousie et de la honte. Heureux s’il n’y fût pas entré encore plus d’amour !","I remained, after this reading, in a state which would be difficult for me to describe because I still do not know today by what kind of feelings I was then agitated. It was one of those unique situations that you have never experienced anything like. One cannot explain them to others, because they have no idea; and it is difficult to disentangle them well for oneself, because being alone of their species, it is not linked to anything in the memory, and cannot even be compared to any known feeling. However, of whatever nature mine were, it is certain that there must have been pain, resentment, jealousy and shame in them. Happy if still more love had not entered into it!","I could never describe the state I was in when I had read this letter, and to this day I cannot decide what sort of emotions swirled round in my soul. It was one of those unique situations, the like of which has never been experienced before: you cannot explain to others because they have no conception of what is meant, and you cannot unravel them for yourself because, being unique, they have no connexion with anything in your memory, nor even with any known feeling at all. And yet, whatever my emotions were, certain it is that grief, rage, jealousy, and humiliation all had a share in them. How I wish that love had not had an even greater share! ‘","""I remained, after reading this, in a state which it would be difficult to describe; for even now I know not the nature of the feelings which then agitated me.   It was one of those unique situations of which others can never have experienced anything even approaching to similarity.   It is impossible to explain it, because other persons can have no idea of its nature; and one can hardly even analyse it to oneself.   Memory furnishes nothing that will connect it with the past, and therefore ordinary language is inadequate to describe it.   Whatever was its nature, however, it is certain that grief, hate, jealousy, and shame entered into its composition.   Fortunate would it have proved for me if love also had not been a component part!"
"– Voyez, lui disais-je, en lui montrant les yeux de la mienne, et dites-moi s’il y a des fautes qui ne soient pas justifiées par une si belle cause.","“See,” I said to him, showing him the eyes of mine, “and tell me if there are faults which are not justified by such a fine cause.","‘Just take a look,’ I would say, pointing to my mistress’s eyes, ‘and say whether there are any sins in the world that are not justified by such a beautiful cause.’","`Look,' I said, at Manon's eyes, and tell me if there is one in the long catalogue of sins that might not there find a plea of justification.'

"Il se déroba aussitôt. Lescaut tomba, sans le moindre mouvement de vie. Je pressai Manon de fuir, car nos secours étaient inutiles à un cadavre, et je craignais d’être arrêté par le guet, qui ne pouvait tarder à paraître. J’enfilai, avec elle et le valet, la première petite rue qui croisait. Elle était si éperdue que j’avais de la peine à la soutenir. Enfin j’aperçus un fiacre au bout de la rue. Nous y montâmes, mais lorsque le cocher me demanda où il fallait nous conduire, je fus embarrassé à lui répondre. Je n’avais point d’asile assuré ni d’ami de confiance à qui j’osasse avoir recours. J’étais sans argent, n’ayant guère plus d’une demi pistole dans ma bourse. La frayeur et la fatigue avaient tellement incommodé Manon qu’elle était à demi pâmée près de moi. J’avais, d’ailleurs, l’imagination remplie du meurtre de Lescaut, et je n’étais pas encore sans appréhension de la part du guet. Quel parti prendre ? Je me souvins heureusement de l’auberge de Chaillot, où j’avais passé quelques jours avec Manon, lorsque nous étions allés dans ce village pour y demeurer. J’espérai non seulement d’y être en sûreté, mais d’y pouvoir vivre quelque temps sans être pressé de payer.","He pulled away immediately. Lescaut fell, without the slightest movement of life. I pressed Manon to flee, for our help was useless for a corpse, and I was afraid of being arrested by the watch, which could not be long in appearing. I walked, with her and the valet, down the first little street that crossed. She was so distraught that I could hardly support her. Finally I saw a cab at the end of the street. We got on it, but when the coachman asked me where to take us, I was embarrassed to answer him. I had no secure asylum or trusted friend to whom I dared to have recourse. I was penniless, having scarcely more than half a pistole in my purse. Fear and fatigue had bothered Manon so much that she was half swooning beside me. I had, moreover, the imagination filled with the murder of Lescaut, and I was not yet without apprehension on the part of the watch. What side to take? Fortunately, I remembered the Auberge de Chaillot, where I had spent a few days with Manon, when we had gone to that village to stay. I hoped not only to be safe there, but to be able to live there for some time without being in a hurry to pay.","He fired a pistol at him and at once made off. Lescaut fell lifeless. I urged Manon to fly, for we were useless to a corpse, and I was afraid of being arrested by the watch who were bound to come on the scene. With her and the attendant I darted down the first narrow turning. She was so panic-stricken that I could hardly prevent her from collapsing. At last I saw a cab at the end of the street. We jumped in. But when the driver asked us the address I was nonplussed, for I had no safe retreat, no trusty friend I dared fall back on, and no money either, having barely half a pistole left in my purse. Manon was so unhinged by terror and fatigue that she was only half conscious and slumped down by my side. Moreover, my own thoughts were haunted by the murder of Lescaut and I was still nervous about the watch. What was to be done? Happily I remembered the inn at Chaillot where I had spent some time with Manon when we had first gone to that village to look for somewhere to live. I hoped to find safety there, and, what was more, to be able to live there for a while without having to pay.","He then instantly disappeared.   Lescaut fell, without the least sign of life.   I pressed Manon to fly, for we could be of no use to a dead man, and I feared being arrested by the police, who would certainly be soon upon the spot.   I turned down the first narrow street with her and the servant: she was so overpowered by the scene she had just witnessed, that I could hardly support her.   At last, at the end of the street, I perceived a hackney-coach; we got into it, but when the coachman asked whither he should drive, I was scarcely able to answer him.   I had no certain asylum--no confidential friend to whom I could have recourse.   I was almost destitute of money, having but one dollar left in my purse.   Fright and fatigue had so unnerved Manon, that she was almost fainting at my side.   My imagination too was full of the murder of Lescaut, and I was not without strong apprehensions of the patrol.   What was to be done?   I luckily remembered the inn at Chaillot, where we first went to reside in that village.   I hoped to be not only secure, but to continue there for some time without being pressed for payment.  "

He said that he had not seen Manon, but had heard of her – at least if she was the one who had been old G. M.’s mistress. I guessed that he would have been told about the part I had played in that affair, and so I decided to win his sympathy by a little praiseworthy candour. I told him the whole story of Manon and myself.","Next morning I dressed as well as, in my present state of indigence, I could possibly contrive to do; and went in a hackney coach to the residence of M. de T----.

"Elle marqua peu d’attention pour mon chagrin, et dans le mouvement de sa joie, qui me parut en effet d’une vivacité singulière, elle me fit mille peintures plaisantes de la manière dont elle avait passé le jour. « Étrange fille ! me disais-je à moi-même ; que dois-je attendre de ce prélude ? » L’aventure de notre première séparation me revint à l’esprit.

"J’ajoutai mille choses, ou tristes ou violentes, suivant que les passions qui m’agitaient tour à tour cédaient ou emportaient le dessus. Cependant, à force de me tourmenter, mes transports diminuèrent assez pour faire place à quelques réflexions. Je comparai cette dernière infortune à celles que j’avais déjà essuyées dans le même genre, et je ne trouvai pas qu’il y eût plus à désespérer que dans les premières. Je connaissais Manon ; pourquoi m’affliger tant d’un malheur que j’avais dû prévoir ? Pourquoi ne pas m’employer plutôt à chercher du remède ? Il était encore temps. Je devais du moins n’y pas épargner mes soins, si je ne voulais avoir à me reprocher d’avoir contribué, par ma négligence, à mes propres peines. Je me mis là-dessus à considérer tous les moyens qui pouvaient m’ouvrir un chemin à l’espérance.","I added a thousand things, either sad or violent, according as the passions which agitated me by turns yielded or gained the upper hand.

I ought at least not to spare my care, if I did not want to have to reproach myself for having contributed, by my negligence, to my own sorrows.

I knew what Manon was: why go on upsetting myself about a misfortune I ought to have foreseen? Would it not be better to set about finding a remedy? There was still time. If I did not want to have to reproach myself for letting my troubles win by default, then at least I had better spare no pains in setting them right.

So we settled with the attendant that our attempt should not be put off any later than the morrow, and, to make assurance as sure as in us lay, we decided to smuggle in men’s clothes to simplify the escape. It was not easy to get the clothes into her room, but my resourcefulness was not at a loss for a way. I merely asked M. de T. to wear two thin waistcoats, one over the other, when he came next day, and I undertook to see to the rest.","""However sound this reasoning, it could not, in my mind, outweigh the immediate prospect of restoring Manon to liberty.

We then settled with the servant that he should carry his project into execution the following day, and to render our success as certain as he could, we resolved to carry into the prison men's clothes, in order to facilitate her escape.

J’ai ajouté qu’étant tout à fait convaincue que vous agiriez pacifiquement, je n’avais pas fait difficulté de vous dire que je venais à Paris pour quelques affaires, que vous y aviez consenti et qu’y étant venu vous-même, vous n’aviez pas paru extrêmement inquiet, lorsque je vous avais quitté. « Si je croyais, m’a-t-il dit, qu’il fût d’humeur à bien vivre avec moi, je serais le premier à lui offrir mes services et mes civilités. » Je l’ai assuré que, du caractère dont je vous connaissais, je ne doutais point que vous n’y répondissiez honnêtement, surtout, lui ai-je dit, s’il pouvait vous servir dans vos affaires, qui étaient fort dérangées depuis que vous étiez mal avec votre famille. Il m’a interrompue, pour me protester qu’il vous rendrait tous les services qui dépendraient de lui, et que, si vous vouliez même vous embarquer dans un autre amour il vous procurerait une jolie maîtresse, qu’il avait quittée pour s’attacher à moi.","“I confess to you,” she continued, “that I was struck by this magnificence. I reflected that it would be a pity to suddenly deprive us of so much property, by contenting myself with taking away the ten thousand francs and the jewels, that it was a fortune ready made for you and for me, and that we could live agreeably at the expense of G... M... Instead of offering him the Comedy, I took it into my head to sound him out on your subject, to foresee what facilities we would have to see each other assuming running my system. I found him to be of a very treatable character. He asked me what I thought of you, and whether I had any regrets in leaving you. I told him that you were so kind and that you had always dealt with me so honestly that it was not natural that I could hate you. He confessed that you had merit, and that he felt inclined to desire your friendship. He wanted to know how I thought you would take my departure, especially when you came to know that I was in his hands. I replied that the date of our love was already so long ago that he had had time to cool down a little, that you were not very comfortable, and that you might not look my loss as a great misfortune because it would relieve you of a burden that weighed on your arms. I added that being completely convinced that you would act peacefully, I had no difficulty in telling you that I was coming to Paris on some business, that you had consented to it and that having come there yourself, you hadn't seemed extremely worried when I left you. ""If I believed,"" he told me, ""that he was in the mood to live well with me, I would be the first to offer him my services and my courtesies. I assured him that, from the character with which I knew you, I had no doubt that you would answer it honestly, above all, I said to him, if he could help you in your affairs, which had been very disturbed since then. that you were bad with your family. He interrupted me, to protest to me that he would render you all the services which depended on him, and that, if you even wanted to embark on another love, he would procure for you a pretty mistress, whom he had left to attach to me.","‘I admit,’ she said, ‘that I was impressed by all this magnificence, and it seemed to me that it would be a pity to spoil our chances of so much money in the long run, by merely being content to disappear there and then with the ten thousand francs and the jewels. Here was a fortune ready to drop into our hands, and you and I might live very comfortably at G. M.’s expense. Instead of suggesting the theatre, I took it into my head to sound him about you, so as to get an idea of our chances of seeing one another if my plan came off successfully. I found him very easy to manage. He asked me what I felt about you and whether I had any regrets about leaving you. I said that you were so charming and had always been so good to me that it was hardly to be expected that I could dislike you. He admitted that you were a good fellow and that he had been drawn to you as a friend. He wanted to know how I thought you would take my leaving you, particularly when you found out that I was in his hands. I told him that our love affair was already of such long standing that our passion had had time to cool off somewhat; also that you were rather uneasy about it, and might not take losing me as a very great disaster, because it would free you from a burden which you were beginning to find irksome. I added that I had not found it difficult to allege that I was going to Paris on business, because I knew that you would not make a fuss, and that you had agreed and come along yourself and not seemed particularly upset when I had left you. “If I thought,” he said, “that he would be prepared to be on good terms with me, I would be the first to pay my respects and offer him my services.” I said that from what I knew of your character I was sure that you would respond to such a gesture, especially if he could render you some assistance in your business affairs, which had been in a precarious state since you had broken with your family. He hastened to say that he would do you any service that lay in his power, and even, supposing you felt inclined to embark on another love affair, procure you a pretty girl he had just given up in order to live with me.","""`I acknowledge,' continued Manon, `that I was dazzled by all this magnificence.   It struck me that it would be madness to sacrifice at once so many good things for the mere sake of carrying off the money and the jewels already in my possession; that it was a certain fortune made for both you and me, and that we might pass the remainder of our lives most agreeably and comfortably at the expense of G---- M----. ""`Instead of proposing the theatre, I thought it more prudent to sound his feelings with regard to you, in order to ascertain what facilities we should have for meeting in future, on the supposition that I could carry my project into effect.   I found him of a most tractable disposition.   He asked me how I felt towards you, and if I had not experienced some compunction at quitting you.   I told him that you were so truly amiable, and had ever treated me with such undeviating kindness, that it was impossible I could hate you.   He admitted that you were a man of merit, and expressed an ardent desire to gain your friendship. ""`He was anxious to know how I thought you would take my elopement, particularly when you should learn that I was in his hands.   I answered, that our love was of such long standing as to have had time to moderate a little; that, besides, you were not in very easy circumstances, and would probably not consider my departure as any severe misfortune, inasmuch as it would relieve you from a burden of no very insignificant nature.   I added that, being perfectly convinced you would take the whole matter rationally, I had not hesitated to tell you that I had some business in Paris; but you had at once consented, and that having accompanied me yourself, you did not seem very uneasy when we separated. ""`If I thought,' said he to me, 'that he could bring himself to live on good terms with me, I should be too happy to make him a tender of my services and attentions.'   I assured him that, from what I knew of your disposition, I had no doubt you would acknowledge his kindness in a congenial spirit: especially, I added, if he could assist you in your affairs, which had become embarrassed since your disagreement with your family.   He interrupted me by declaring, that he would gladly render you any service in his power, and that if you were disposed to form a new attachment, he would introduce you to an extremely pretty woman, whom he had just given up for me."
"– Je le veux bien, me dit-elle ; mais vous n’approuvez donc pas mon projet ?","'I will,' she said to me; but then you do not approve of my project?","‘Yes, I would like to,’ she said, ‘but don’t you approve of my plan, then?’","""`Nothing can give me more pleasure,' said she; `but you don't approve then of my project?'"
Elle m’interrompit :,She interrupted me:,She cut me short. ‘,"""She interrupted me."
"Toute notre conversation fut à peu près du même goût, pendant le souper Manon, qui était badine, fut sur le point, plusieurs fois, de gâter tout par ses éclats de rire. Je trouvai l’occasion, en soupant, de lui raconter sa propre histoire, et le mauvais sort lui le menaçait. Lescaut et Manon tremblaient pendant mon récit, surtout lorsque je faisais son portrait au naturel ; mais l’amour-propre l’empêcha de s’y reconnaître, et je l’achevai si adroitement, qu’il fut le premier à le trouver fort risible. Vous verrez que ce n’est pas sans raison que je me suis étendu sur cette ridicule scène. Enfin, l’heure du sommeil étant arrivée, il parla d’amour et d’impatience. Nous nous retirâmes, Lescaut et moi ; on le conduisit à sa chambre, et Manon, étant sortie sous prétexte d’un besoin, nous vint joindre à la porte. Le carrosse, qui nous attendait trois ou quatre maisons plus bas, s’avança pour nous recevoir. Nous nous éloignâmes en un instant du quartier.","Our whole conversation was more or less in the same vein during supper. Manon, who was playful, was on the point, several times, of spoiling everything with her bursts of laughter. I found an opportunity, over supper, to tell him his own story, and bad luck threatened him. Lescaut and Manon trembled during my story, especially when I painted her portrait in the natural; but self-love prevented him from recognizing himself in it, and I finished him off so skillfully that he was the first to find it very laughable. You will see that it is not without reason that I dwell on this ridiculous scene. Finally, when it was time for sleep, he spoke of love and impatience. We withdrew, Lescaut and I; we led him to his room, and Manon, having gone out on the pretext of a need, came to join us at the door. The carriage, which was waiting for us three or four houses below, came forward to receive us. We moved away in an instant from the neighborhood.","All through supper the conversation was on about the same level. Manon, who was in a gay mood, nearly upset everything several times by shrieking with laughter. I contrived to tell him his own story, not excluding the nasty dénouement in store for him. It was amusing to see Manon and Lescaut trembling, especially while I was doing a lifelike impersonation of him, but he was too vain to recognize himself, and I brought the story to so neat a conclusion that he was the first to find it vastly amusing. You will see in due course that I have my reasons for dwelling on this ridiculous episode. At length bedtime drew near, and he began saying things about the impatience of lovers. Lescaut and I withdrew. He was helped up to his room, and Manon, alleging a natural need, slipped away and joined us at the front door. The carriage was waiting three or four doors down the street, and it came to pick us up. In a trice we were far away.","""The whole conversation during supper was of the same kind.   Manon, with her usual gaiety, was several times on the point of spoiling the joke by her bursts of laughter.   I contrived, while eating, to recount his own identical history, and to paint even the fate that awaited him.   Lescaut and Manon were in an agony of fear during my recital, especially while I was drawing his portrait to the life: but his own vanity prevented him from recognising it, and I did it so well that he was the first to pronounce it extremely laughable.   You will allow that I had reason for dwelling on this ridiculous scene. At length it was time to retire.   He hinted at the impatience of love.   Lescaut and I took our departure.   G---- M---- went to his room, and Manon, making some excuse for her absence, came to join us at the gate.   The coach, that was waiting for us a few doors off, drove up towards us, and we were out of the street in an instant."
"Je lui mis entre les mains les cent pistoles que j’avais reçues de M. de T... Elles furent employées, le lendemain, jusqu’au dernier sol. Les trois soldats passèrent en revue devant moi.

They were used the next day to the last sol. The three soldiers passed in review in front of me. I encouraged them with great promises, and to relieve them of all mistrust, I began by making a present to them, each, of ten pistoles.","I gave him the hundred pistoles I had had from M. de T., and they were spent the next day to the last sou.

"– Non, non, me dit-il d’un ton sévère ; j’aime mieux te voir sans vie que sans sagesse et sans honneur.","“No, no,” he said to me in a severe tone; I would rather see you without life than without wisdom and without honour.","‘No, no,’ he said sternly, ‘I would rather see you without life than without virtue and honour.’","`No! no!' replied he, in the severest tone; `I would rather see you lifeless, than infamous and depraved.'"
"– Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, lui dit-il avec un sourire forcé, j’ouvre en effet les yeux, et je vous trouve bien moins novice que je ne me l’étais figuré.","“Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle,” he said to her with a forced smile, “I am indeed opening my eyes, and I find you much less of a novice than I had imagined.","But he quickly recovered himself, and I gave up my idea on hearing his reply, which struck me as rather crude: ‘Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle,’ he said, with a forced smile, ‘I certainly have had my eyes opened, and I see you are far less of a novice than I had supposed.’","""`Young lady! young lady!' said he to her, with a sardonic smile, 'my eyes in truth are opened, and I perceive that you are much less of a novice than I had pictured to myself.'"
"Je suis persuadé qu’il n’y a point d’honnête homme au monde qui n’eût approuvé mes vues dans les circonstances où j’étais, c’est-à-dire asservi fatalement à une passion que je ne pouvais vaincre et combattu par des remords que je ne devais point étouffer. Mais se trouvera-t-il quelqu’un qui accuse mes plaintes d’injustice, si je gémis de la rigueur du Ciel à rejeter un dessein que je n’avais formé que pour lui plaire ?

Il m’avait souffert avec patience tandis que je marchais aveuglément dans la route du vice, et ses plus rudes châtiments m’étaient réservés lorsque je commençais à retourner à la vertu.

"Je pénétrai sans obstacle jusqu’à l’appartement. Manon était occupée à lire. Ce fut là que j’eus lieu d’admirer le caractère de cette étrange fille.

"Il m’en coûta six louis d’or.

Elle me répondit avec une modestie si douce et si charmante, que je ne pus m’empêcher de faire, en sortant, mille réflexions sur le caractère incompréhensible des femmes.","It cost me six louis d'or.

"– Vous serez donc la plus riche personne de l’univers, me répondit-elle, car s’il n’y eut jamais d’amour tel que le vôtre, il est impossible aussi d’être aimé plus tendrement que vous l’êtes. Je me rends justice, continua-t-elle. Je sens bien que je n’ai jamais mérité ce prodigieux attachement que vous avez pour moi. Je vous ai causé des chagrins, que vous n’avez pu me pardonner sans une bonté extrême. J’ai été légère et volage, et même en vous aimant éperdument, comme j’ai toujours fait, je n’étais qu’une ingrate. Mais vous ne sauriez croire combien je suis changée. Mes larmes, que vous avez vues couler si souvent depuis notre départ de France, n’ont pas eu une seule fois mes malheurs pour objet. J’ai cessé de les sentir aussitôt que vous avez commencé à les partager. Je n’ai pleuré que de tendresse et de compassion pour vous. Je ne me console point d’avoir pu vous chagriner un moment dans ma vie. Je ne cesse point de me reprocher mes inconstances et de m’attendrir en admirant de quoi l’amour vous a rendu capable pour une malheureuse qui n’en était pas digne, et qui ne paierait pas bien de tout son sang, ajouta-t-elle avec une abondance de larmes, la moitié des peines qu’elle vous a causées.","“So you will be the richest person in the universe,” she replied, “because if there was never a love like yours, it is also impossible to be loved more tenderly than you are. . I do myself justice, she continued. I feel that I have never deserved this prodigious attachment that you have for me. I have caused you grief, which you could not forgive me without extreme kindness. I was light and fickle, and even while loving you madly, as I have always done, I was only ungrateful. But you wouldn't believe how changed I am. My tears, which you have seen flow so often since our departure from France, have not once had my misfortunes as their object. I stopped feeling them as soon as you started sharing them. I only cried out of tenderness and compassion for you. I cannot console myself for having been able to grieve you for a moment in my life. I do not cease to reproach myself for my inconsistencies and to soften in admiring what love has made you capable of for an unfortunate woman who was not worthy of it, and who would not pay well with all her blood, added-t-t- she cried with an abundance of tears, half the pain she caused you.","‘Then you will be the richest person in the universe,’ she answered, ‘for if there has never been a love like yours, it is equally impossible to be loved more tenderly than you are. I know what I am,’ she went on, ‘ and I know full well that I have never been worthy of the wonderful affection you have for me. I have hurt you in ways you could never have forgiven but for your unfailing goodness. I have been frivolous and fickle, and even while loving you passionately, as I have always done, I have never been anything but graceless. But you cannot imagine how I have changed. The tears you have seen me shed so often since we left France have never once been for my own troubles, for I ceased to feel them as soon as you began to share them with me. No, I have only wept out of love and pity for you. I cannot console myself for having given you a single moment’s pain in my life. Over and over again I blame myself for my inconstancy, and my heart aches when I think what love has made you capable of doing for an unhappy woman all unworthy of it, and who,’ she ended with a flood of tears, ‘if she gave all the blood in her body, could never repay half the sorrow she has brought upon you.’","""`In that case,' she answered, `you shall be the richest man in the universe; for, as there never was love surpassing yours, so it is impossible for man to be loved more tenderly than you are by me.   I well know,' she continued, `that I have never merited the almost incredible fidelity and attachment which you have shown for me.   I have often caused you annoyances, which nothing but excessive fondness could have induced you to pardon.   I have been thoughtless and volatile; and even while loving you as I have always done to distraction, I was never free from a consciousness of ingratitude.   But you cannot believe how much my nature is altered; those tears which you have so frequently seen me shed since quitting the French shore, have not been caused by my own misfortunes.   Since you began to share them with me, I have been a stranger to selfishness: I only wept from tenderness and compassion for you.   I am inconsolable at the thought of having given you one instant's pain during my past life.   I never cease upbraiding myself with my former inconstancy, and wondering at the sacrifices which love has induced you to make for a miserable and unworthy wretch, who could not, with the last drop of her blood, compensate for half the torments she has caused you.'"

"Que les résolutions humaines soient sujettes à changer, c’est ce qui ne m’a jamais causé d’étonnement ; une passion les fait naître, une autre passion peut les détruire ; mais quand je pense à la sainteté de celles qui m’avaient conduit à Saint-Sulpice et à la joie intérieure que le Ciel m’y faisait goûter en les exécutant, je suis effrayé de la facilité avec laquelle j’ai pu les rompre. S’il est vrai que les secours célestes sont à tous moments d’une force égale à celle des passions, qu’on m’explique donc par quel funeste ascendant on se trouve emporté tout d’un coup loin de son devoir sans se trouver capable de la moindre résistance, et sans ressentir le moindre remords. Je me croyais absolument délivré des faiblesses de l’amour. Il me semblait que j’aurais préféré la lecture d’une page de saint Augustin, ou un quart d’heure de méditation chrétienne, à tous les plaisirs des sens, sans excepter ceux qui m’auraient été offerts par Manon. Cependant, un instant malheureux me fit retomber dans le précipice, et ma chute fut d’autant plus irréparable que, me trouvant tout d’un coup au même degré de profondeur d’où j’étais sorti, les nouveaux désordres où je tombai me portèrent bien plus loin vers le fond de l’abîme.","That human resolutions are subject to change has never astonished me; one passion gives birth to them, another passion can destroy them; but when I think of the sanctity of those which had led me to Saint-Sulpice and of the inner joy that Heaven made me taste there by executing them, I am terrified at the ease with which I was able to break them. If it is true that the celestial aids are at all times of a force equal to that of the passions, then explain to me by what disastrous ascendancy one finds oneself suddenly carried away from one's duty without finding oneself capable of the slightest resistance, and without feeling the slightest remorse. I believed myself absolutely delivered from the weaknesses of love. It seemed to me that I would have preferred reading a page of Saint Augustine, or a quarter of an hour of Christian meditation, to all the pleasures of the senses, without excepting those offered to me by Manon. However, an unfortunate moment caused me to fall back into the precipice, and my fall was all the more irreparable because, finding myself suddenly at the same degree of depth from which I had emerged, the new disorders into which I had fallen carried much further towards the bottom of the abyss.","All human resolutions are subject to change: that in itself has never surprised me, for they are born of a passion and another passion may destroy them. But when I think of the purity of the resolves which led me to Saint-Sulpice, and the deep inner peace which God poured into my soul as I carried them out, I am appalled at the ease with which I broke them. If it be true that Heaven always gives us strength equal to that of our passions, how can we explain the terrible power which can suddenly carry us far away from our duty, stripping us of all strength to resist and all feelings of remorse? I thought I was saved for ever from the weakness of love; I imagined that I should always prefer reading a page of St Augustine or a quarter of an hour’s pious meditation to all the pleasures of the senses, even those that Manon might give. And yet one accursed moment plunged me back into the abyss, and my fall was all the more irreparable because, when I found myself brought as low as I had been before, new excesses dragged me even further down.","""It has never been matter of wonder to me that human resolutions are liable to change; one passion gives them birth, another may destroy them; but when I reflect upon the sacredness of those motives that led me to St. Sulpice, and upon the heartfelt satisfaction I enjoyed while obeying their dictation, I shudder at the facility with which I outraged them all.   If it be true that the benign succour afforded by Heaven is at all times equal to the strongest of man's pinions, I shall be glad to learn the nature of the deplorable ascendancy which causes us suddenly to swerve from the path of duty, without the power of offering the least resistance, and without even the slightest visitation of remorse. ""I now thought myself entirely safe from the dangers of love.   I fancied that I could have preferred a single page of St. Augustine, or a quarter of an hour of Christian meditation, to every sensual gratification, not excepting any that I might have derived even from Manon's society.   Nevertheless, one unlucky moment plunged me again headlong into the gulf; and my ruin was the more irreparable, because, falling at once to the same depth from whence I had been before rescued, each of the new disorders into which I now lapsed carried me deeper and deeper still down the profound abyss of vice.

"Lorsque j’eus perdu l’espérance de recevoir du secours de Tiberge, je vendis mon cheval. L’argent que j’en tirai, joint à ce qui me restait encore de vos libéralités, me composa la petite somme de dix-sept pistoles. J’en employai sept à l’achat de quelques soulagements nécessaires à Manon, et je serrai les dix autres avec soin, comme le fondement de notre fortune et de nos espérances en Amérique. Je n’eus point de peine à me faire recevoir dans le vaisseau. On cherchait alors des jeunes gens qui fussent disposés à se joindre volontairement à la colonie. Le passage et la nourriture me furent accordés gratis. La poste de Paris devant partir le lendemain, j’y laissai une lettre pour Tiberge.

The money I got from it, added to what still remained to me of your liberalities, made up for me the small sum of seventeen pistoles.

I had no difficulty in getting myself received into the ship. We were then looking for young people who were willing to join the colony voluntarily. Passage and food were given to me free of charge. The post office in Paris being due to leave the next day, I left a letter there for Tiberge.

I had no trouble about being taken on the ship, for young men ready to join the colony were then in demand, and my food and passage were given me free of charge.

I had no difficulty in getting admitted on board the vessel.   They were at the time looking for young men as voluntary emigrants to the colony.   The passage and provisions were supplied gratis.

"Cette pensée me jeta dans un trouble si affreux, que je balançai, pendant quelques moments, si je ne ferais pas mieux de finir tous mes maux par la mort. Cependant, je conservai assez de présence d’esprit pour vouloir examiner auparavant s’il ne me restait nulle ressource. Le Ciel me fit naître une idée, qui arrêta mon désespoir.

"Dans le temps que j’étais ainsi tout occupé d’elle, j’entendis le bruit de plusieurs personnes qui montaient l’escalier. On frappa doucement à la porte. Manon me donna un baiser et s’échappant de mes bras, elle entra rapidement dans le cabinet, qu’elle ferma aussitôt sur elle. Je me figurai qu’étant un peu en désordre, elle voulait se cacher aux yeux des étrangers qui avaient frappé. J’allai leur ouvrir moi-même. À peine avais-je ouvert, que je me vis saisir par trois hommes, que je reconnus pour les laquais de mon père. Ils ne me firent point de violence ; mais deux d’entre eux m’ayant pris par le bras, le troisième visita mes poches, dont il tira un petit couteau qui était le seul fer que j’eusse sur moi. Ils me demandèrent pardon de la nécessité où ils étaient de me manquer de respect ; ils me dirent naturellement qu’ils agissaient par l’ordre de mon père, et que mon frère aîné m’attendait en bas dans un carrosse. J’étais si troublé, que je me laissai conduire sans résister et sans répondre. Mon frère était effectivement à m’attendre. On me mit dans le carrosse, auprès de lui, et le cocher, qui avait ses ordres, nous conduisit à grand train jusqu’à Saint-Denis. Mon frère m’embrassa tendrement, mais il ne me parla point, de sorte que j’eus tout le loisir dont j’avais besoin, pour rêver à mon infortune.","While I was thus occupied with her, I heard the noise of several people coming up the stairs. There was a soft knock on the door. Manon gave me a kiss and escaping from my arms, she quickly entered the cabinet, which she immediately closed behind her. I imagined that, being a little disorderly, she wanted to hide herself from the eyes of the strangers who had knocked. I went to open it myself. No sooner had I opened the door than I saw myself seized by three men, whom I recognized as my father's lackeys. They did me no violence; but two of them having taken me by the arm, the third looked into my pockets, from which he drew a small knife which was the only iron I had on me. They begged my pardon for the necessity in which they were to disrespect me; they naturally told me that they were acting by order of my father, and that my eldest brother was waiting for me below in a carriage. I was so disturbed that I allowed myself to be led without resisting and without answering. My brother was actually waiting for me. They put me in the carriage, beside him, and the coachman, who had his orders, drove us at full speed to Saint-Denis. My brother kissed me tenderly, but he did not speak to me, so that I had all the leisure I needed to dream of my misfortune.","While I was wholly concerned with her in this way, I heard some footsteps on the stairs. Somebody tapped softly on the door. Manon gave me a kiss, wrenched herself out of my arms, ran quickly into the other room and shut the door behind her. For a moment I imagined that she did not want the strangers to see the state she was in. I opened the outer door. Scarcely had I done so before I was seized by three men whom I recognized as my father’s lackeys. They did not rough-handle me, but two of them pinioned my arms while the third went through my pockets and removed the only weapon I had on me, a small knife. They apologized for being obliged to show me such scant respect, and explained, of course, that they were acting on my father’s orders and that my elder brother was waiting for me down below in a carriage. I was so taken by surprise that I let them lead me away without question or protest. Sure enough my brother was waiting in the carriage and I was put next to him. The coachman, who already had his orders, drove us at full speed to Saint-Denis. My brother embraced me with every sign of affection but did not say a word, so that I had all the leisure I needed for thinking things over.","""While my attention was thus confined to her, I heard people coming upstairs.   They tapped gently at the door.   Manon gave me a kiss, and escaping from my arms, quickly entered the boudoir, turning the key after her.

""I had hardly opened the door, when I found myself seized by three men, whom I recognised as my father's servants.

They begged pardon for the necessity they were under of treating me with apparent disrespect; telling me frankly that they were acting by the orders of my father, and that my eldest brother was in a carriage below waiting to receive me.   My feelings were so overpowered, that I allowed myself to be led away without making either reply or resistance.   I found my brother waiting for me as they had stated.   They placed me by his side, and the coachman immediately drove, by his orders, towards St. Denis.

"Ma consternation fut si grande, que je versais des larmes en descendant l’escalier, sans savoir encore de quel sentiment elles partaient.

I wanted to regard it as an illusion, and I was ready two or three times to return to the house, without noticing that I had noticed it. It seemed to me so impossible that Manon should have betrayed me, that I was afraid of doing her injury by suspecting her. I adored him, that was sure; I had given her no more proofs of love than I had received from her; why should I have accused her of being less sincere and less constant than myself? What reason would she have had to deceive me?

It seemed so impossible that Manon had deceived me that I felt it was insulting even to suspect her. I worshipped her; that was certain, and she had returned my love no less ardently. How could I accuse her of being any less sincere and loyal than I had been? What possible reason could she have for deceiving me?

Still, I dared not recall what I had heard the moment before.   I strove to look upon it as a dream; and was more than once on the point of returning to my lodgings, determined to attach no importance to what I had heard. It appeared to me so impossible that Manon could have been unfaithful, that I feared even to wrong her by a suspicion.

He had questioned him on a thousand details. Finally, he had tried to put him in his interests by considerable promises, and taking out a letter which he had ready, he had offered him a few louis d'or in vain to return it to his mistress.","The next day I went back to Paris without having formed any plan beyond that of increasing my wealth as quickly as possible by playing for higher stakes, so as to be in a position to leave Chaillot at the first sign of trouble. I learned nothing disquieting that evening. The stranger had reappeared in the Bois, and on the strength of what had happened the day before he had again come up to my man and talked about his love, but in terms which did not suggest he had any understanding with Manon. He had questioned him on all sorts of details and finally tried to win him over by lavish promises, and, taking out a letter which he had ready prepared, he had vainly tried to make him accept some gold pieces if he would deliver it to his mistress.","""I returned on the following day to Paris, with no other intention than to hasten the improvement of my fortune, by playing deeper than ever, in order to be in a condition to quit Chaillot on the first real occasion for uneasiness.   That night I learned nothing at all calculated to trouble my repose.   The foreigner had, as usual, made his appearance in the Bois de Boulogne; and venturing, from what had passed the preceding day, to accost my servant more familiarly, he spoke to him openly of his passion, but in such terms as not to lead to the slightest suspicion of Manon's being aware of it.   He put a thousand questions to him, and at last tried to bribe him with large promises; and taking a letter from his pocket, he in vain entreated him, with the promise of some louis d'ors, to convey it to her."
"– J’ai compté, disais-je pour me consoler, que vingt mille écus nous suffiraient pendant dix ans. Supposons que les dix ans soient écoulés, et que nul des changements que j’espérais ne soit arrivé dans ma famille. Quel parti prendrais-je ? Je ne le sais pas trop bien, mais, ce que je ferais alors, qui m’empêche de le faire aujourd’hui ? Combien de personnes vivent à Paris, qui n’ont ni mon esprit, ni mes qualités naturelles, et qui doivent néanmoins leur entretien à leurs talents, tels qu’ils les ont ! La Providence, ajoutais-je, en réfléchissant sur les différents états de la vie, n’a-t-elle pas arrangé les choses fort sagement ? La plupart des grands et des riches sont des sots : cela est clair à qui connaît un peu le monde. Or il y a là-dedans une justice admirable : s’ils joignaient l’esprit aux richesses, ils seraient trop heureux, et le reste des hommes trop misérable. Les qualités du corps et de l’âme sont accordées à ceux-ci, comme des moyens pour se tirer de la misère et de la pauvreté. Les uns prennent part aux richesses des grands en servant à leurs plaisirs : ils en font des dupes ; d’autres servent à leur instruction : ils tâchent d’en faire d’honnêtes gens ; il est rare, à la vérité, qu’ils y réussissent, mais ce n’est pas là le but de la divine Sagesse : ils tirent toujours un fruit de leurs besoins, qui est de vivre aux dépens de ceux qu’ils instruisent, et de quelque façon qu’on le prenne, c’est un fond excellent de revenu pour les petits, que la sottise des riches et des grands.","“I reckoned,” I said to console myself, “that twenty thousand crowns would be enough for us for ten years. Suppose the ten years are up, and none of the changes I was hoping for have happened in my family. What side would I take? I'm not sure, but what I would do then, who's stopping me from doing it today? How many people live in Paris who have neither my mind nor my natural qualities, and who nevertheless owe their maintenance to their talents, such as they have them! Providence, I added, in reflecting on the different states of life, has it not arranged things very wisely? Most of the great and the rich are fools: that is clear to anyone who knows the world a little. Now there is an admirable justice in this: if they joined the spirit to riches, they would be too happy, and the rest of men too miserable. The qualities of the body and the soul are granted to them, as means to get out of misery and poverty. Some take part in the riches of the great by serving their pleasures: they make dupes of them; others serve for their instruction: they try to make honest people of them; it is rare, in truth, that they succeed in this, but that is not the aim of divine Wisdom: they always draw a fruit from their needs, which is to live at the expense of those whom they instruct, and however you look at it, the stupidity of the rich and the great is an excellent fund of revenue for the little ones.","I consoled myself by recalling that I had calculated that twenty thousand écus would keep us for ten years. Now, I thought, supposing the ten years had gone by without any of the family changes I had hoped for. What should I have done? I am not at all sure, but what is there to prevent my doing now whatever I should have done in those circumstances? How many people are there in Paris at this moment who have neither my wits nor my natural advantages, but who manage to make a living by their talents, such as they are? Thereupon I fell to musing on the ups and downs of life and came to the conclusion that Providence had arranged things pretty wisely, for the majority of the rich are fools – that much is clear to anybody with some slight knowledge of the world. Which proves the ultimate justice of things, for, if they had brains as well as riches, they would be too happy and the rest of men too wretched. The poor are vouchsafed qualities of mind and body to raise them out of their poverty. Some get a share of the wealth of the great by pandering to their pleasures and swindling them. Others try to teach them to be useful citizens – usually, it is true, without success – but that is not the object of divine wisdom; they draw a dividend from their labours by living at the expense of those they instruct, and, from whatever angle you look at it, the stupidity of the rich and great is an excellent source of revenue for the poor and humble.","""I had calculated in endeavouring to comfort myself, that twenty thousand crowns would support us for ten years.   Suppose that these ten years had now elapsed, and that none of the events which I had looked for in my family had occurred.   What then would have been my course?   I hardly know; but whatever I should then have done, why may I not do now?   How many are there in Paris, who have neither my talents, nor the natural advantages I possess, and who, notwithstanding, owe their support to the exercise of their talents, such as they are? ""`Has not Providence,' I added, while reflecting on the different conditions of life, `arranged things wisely?'   The greater number of the powerful and the rich are fools.   No one who knows anything of the world can doubt that.   How admirable is the compensating justice thereof!   If wealth brought with it talent also, the rich would be too happy, and other men too wretched.   To these latter are given personal advantages and genius, to help them out of misery and want.   Some of them share the riches of the wealthy by administering to their pleasures, or by making them their dupes; others afford them instruction, and endeavour to make them decent members of society; to be sure, they do not always succeed; but that was probably not the intention of the divine wisdom.   In every case they derive a benefit from their labours by living at the expense of their pupils; and, in whatever point of view it is considered, the follies of the rich are a bountiful source of revenue to the humbler classes."
"Où trouver un barbare qu’un repentir si vif et si tendre n’eût pas touché ? Pour moi, je sentis, dans ce moment, que j’aurais sacrifié pour Manon tous les évêchés du monde chrétien. Je lui demandai quel nouvel ordre elle jugeait à propos de mettre dans nos affaires. Elle me dit qu’il fallait sur-le-champ sortir du séminaire, et remettre à nous arranger dans un lieu plus sûr. Je consentis à toutes ses volontés sans réplique. Elle entra dans son carrosse, pour aller m’attendre au coin de la rue. Je m’échappai un moment après, sans être aperçu du portier. Je montai avec elle. Nous passâmes à la friperie. Je repris les galons et l’épée. Manon fournit aux frais, car j’étais sans un sou ; et dans la crainte que je ne trouvasse de l’obstacle à ma sortie de Saint-Sulpice, elle n’avait pas voulu que je retournasse un moment à ma chambre pour y prendre mon argent. Mon trésor d’ailleurs, était médiocre, et elle assez riche des libéralités de B... pour mépriser ce qu’elle me faisait abandonner. Nous conférâmes, chez le fripier même, sur le parti que nous allions prendre. Pour me faire valoir davantage le sacrifice qu’elle me faisait de B..., elle résolut de ne pas garder avec lui le moindre ménagement.","Where to find a barbarian whom such lively and tender repentance would not have touched? As for me, I felt, at that moment, that I would have sacrificed all the bishoprics of the Christian world for Manon. I asked her what new order she thought fit to put in our affairs. She told me that we had to get out of the seminary right away and start making arrangements in a safer place. I consented to all his wishes without reply. She entered her carriage to wait for me at the corner of the street. I escaped a moment later, without being seen by the porter. I went up with her. We went to the thrift store. I took up the stripes and the sword. Manon provides for the expenses, because I was penniless; and fearing that I might find some obstacle in my way out of Saint-Sulpice, she had not wanted me to return for a moment to my room to take my money. My treasury, moreover, was mediocre, and she was sufficiently rich in the liberalities of B... to despise what she made me abandon. We conferred, at the thrift store itself, on the course we were going to take. To make me appreciate more the sacrifice she was making to me of B..., she resolved not to show him the slightest consideration.","What heart of stone would not have been softened by such a touching proof of bitter remorse? For my part I felt at that moment that I would have given up all the bishoprics in Christendom for Manon. I asked her what steps we ought to take next, and she said that first and foremost we must get out of the seminary and think things out in some safer place. I fell in with all her wishes without question. She drove in her carriage to the corner of the street and waited there, while I slipped out and joined her a minute later without having been noticed by the doorkeeper. We began by going to a wardrobe dealer’s, where I resumed the braided coat and sword, Manon paying for everything as I had not a penny (for fear of anything happening to prevent my getting out of Saint-Sulpice, she had not allowed me to go back to my room even for a moment to get my money). In any case my fortune was very modest, while thanks to the liberality of M. de B. she was rich enough to think nothing of what she was making me leave behind. While we were still in the shop we had a conference about what we should do next. She announced her intention of making a clean break with M. de B. This was calculated to make me appreciate the full value of what she was prepared to give up for me.","""Could any savage remain unmoved by such proofs of cordial repentance as those I had just witnessed?   For my part, I felt at the moment that I could gladly have given up all the bishoprics in Christendom for Manon.   I asked what course she would recommend in our present emergency. `It is requisite,' she replied, `at all events, to quit the seminary, and settle in some safer place.'   I consented to everything she proposed.   She got into her carriage to go and wait for me at the corner of the street.   I escaped the next moment, without attracting the porter's notice.   I entered the carriage, and we drove off to a Jew's.   I there resumed my lay-dress and sword.   Manon furnished the supplies, for I was without a sou, and fearing that I might meet with some new impediment, she would not consent to my returning to my room at St. Sulpice for my purse.   My finances were in truth wretchedly low, and hers more than sufficiently enriched by the liberality of M. de B---- to make her think lightly of my loss.

– De qui vient cette lettre ? lui dis-je en montant.,- Who is this letter from? I tell him on the way up.,‘Who sent this letter?’ I said as we went upstairs.,`Who is the writer of this letter?' I enquired.  
"M. Lescaut me présenta, le soir même, comme un de ses parents ; il ajouta que j’étais d’autant mieux disposé à réussir que j’avais besoin des plus grandes faveurs de la fortune. Cependant, pour faire connaître que ma misère n’était pas celle d’un homme de néant, il leur dit que j’étais dans le dessein de leur donner à souper. L’offre fut acceptée. Je les traitai magnifiquement. On s’entretint longtemps de la gentillesse de ma figure et de mes heureuses dispositions. On prétendit qu’il y avait beaucoup à espérer de moi, parce qu’ayant quelque chose dans la physionomie qui sentait l’honnête homme, personne ne se défierait de mes artifices. Enfin, on rendit grâce à M. Lescaut d’avoir procuré à l’Ordre un novice de mon mérite, et l’on chargea un des chevaliers de me donner, pendant quelques jours, les instructions nécessaires. Le principal théâtre de mes exploits devait être l’hôtel de Transylvanie, où il y avait une table de pharaon dans une salle et divers autres jeux de cartes et de dés dans la galerie. Cette académie se tenait au profit de M. le prince de R..., qui demeurait alors à Clagny, et la plupart de ses officiers étaient de notre société. Le dirai-je à ma honte ? Je profitai en peu de temps des leçons de mon maître. J’acquis surtout beaucoup d’habileté à faire une volte-face, à filer la carte, et m’aidant fort bien d’une longue paire de manchettes, j’escamotais assez légèrement pour tromper les yeux des plus habiles, et ruiner sans affectation quantité d’honnêtes joueurs. Cette adresse extraordinaire hâta si fort les progrès de ma fortune, que je me trouvai en peu de semaines des sommes considérables, outre celles que je partageais de bonne foi avec mes associés. Je ne craignis plus, alors, de découvrir à Manon notre perte de Chaillot, et, pour la consoler en lui apprenant cette fâcheuse nouvelle, je louai une maison garnie, où nous nous établîmes avec un air d’opulence et de sécurité.","M. Lescaut introduced me that very evening as one of his relatives; he added that I was so much the better disposed to succeed as I needed the greatest favors of fortune. However, to make it known that my misery was not that of a man of nothingness, he told them that I intended to give them supper. The offer was accepted. I treated them beautifully. They talked for a long time about the kindness of my face and my happy dispositions. It was said that there was much to be hoped for from me, because having something in my countenance which smacked of an honest man, no one would mistrust my artifices. Finally, they gave thanks to M. Lescaut for having procured for the Order a novice of my merit, and they charged one of the knights to give me the necessary instructions for a few days. The principal theater of my exploits was to be the Hotel de Transylvanie, where there was a pharaoh's table in one room and various other games of cards and dice in the gallery. This academy was held for the benefit of M. le prince de R..., who then lived at Clagny, and most of his officers were from our company. Shall I say it to my shame? I profited in a short time from the lessons of my master. Above all, I acquired a great deal of skill in doing a volte-face, in slipping the map, and helping myself very well with a long pair of cuffs, I evaded lightly enough to deceive the eyes of the most skilful, and ruin without assignment amount of honest players. This extraordinary address hastened the progress of my fortune so greatly that in a few weeks I found myself considerable sums, in addition to those which I shared in good faith with my associates. I no longer feared, then, to inform Manon of our loss of Chaillot, and, to console her by telling her this unfortunate news, I hired a furnished house, where we established ourselves with an air of opulence and security.","That very evening M. Lescaut introduced me as a relation of his, explaining that I was all the more likely to succeed because I was in urgent need of a stroke of good luck. But to make it clear that my poverty was not as abject as all that, he announced that I wished to entertain them to supper. The invitation was accepted and I feasted them royally. For a considerable time the conversation ran along the lines of my handsome appearance and natural gifts. It was asserted that great things might be hoped from me because there was something about my face which suggested the honest man, and nobody would think of expecting anything crooked from me. In fine, a vote of thanks was passed to M. Lescaut for having brought along such a promising novice to the brotherhood, and one of their number was detailed to give me a few days of necessary instruction. The principal scene of my exploits was to be the Hôtel de Transylvanie, where there was a faro table in one room and various card and dice games in the gallery. This institution was run for the benefit of the Prince of R., who was then living at Clagny, and most of his officers belonged to our circle.11 I must confess to my shame that in a very short time I assimilated all my instructor’s lessons. I became particularly adept at turning a card over, and at palming. With the help of a long pair of cuffs I could whisk a card away nimbly enough to deceive the sharpest eye and neatly ruin many an honest player. This amazing skill built up my fortune so rapidly that in a few weeks I found myself possessed of a considerable sum over and above what I shared out loyally with my associates. Gone were all my fears about telling Manon of our loss at Chaillot, and to console her when I broke the sad news, I took a furnished house where we installed ourselves with every appearance of wealth and security.","""Lescaut presented me that night as a relation of his own.   He added, that I was the more likely to succeed in my new profession, from wanting the favours of fortune.   However, to show them that I was not quite reduced to the lowest ebb, he said it was my intention to treat them with a supper.   The offer was accepted, and I entertained them en prince.   They talked a good deal about my fashionable appearance and the apparent amiability of my disposition; they said that the best hopes might be entertained of me, because there was something in my countenance that bespoke the gentleman, and no one therefore could have a suspicion of my honesty: they voted thanks to Lescaut for having introduced so promising a novice, and deputed one of the members to instruct me for some days in the necessary manoeuvres. ""The principal scene of my exploits was the hotel of Transylvania, where there was a faro table in one room, and other games of cards and dice in the gallery.   This academy was kept by the Prince of R----, who then lived at Clagny, and most of his officers belonged to our society.   Shall I mention it to my shame?   I profited quickly by my instructor's tuition.   I acquired an amazing facility in sleight of hand tricks, and learned in perfection to sauter le coup; with the help of a pair of long ruffles, I shuffled so adroitly as to defy the quickest observer, and I ruined several fair players.   My unrivalled skill so quickened the progress of my fortunes, that I found myself master, in a few weeks, of very considerable sums, besides what I divided in good faith with my companions. ""I had no longer any fear of communicating to Manon the extent of our loss at Chaillot, and, to console her on the announcement of such disastrous news, I took a furnished house, where we established ourselves in all the pride of opulence and security."
"Cette conversation servit du moins à renouveler la pitié de mon ami. Il comprit qu’il y avait plus de faiblesse que de malignité dans mes désordres. Son amitié en fut plus disposée, dans la suite, à me donner des secours, sans lesquels j’aurais péri infailliblement de misère.","This conversation served at least to renew my friend's pity. He understood that there was more weakness than malignity in my disorders. His friendship was the more disposed, afterwards, to give me help, without which I would inevitably have perished of misery.","This conversation had at least the one useful result of reviving my friend’s sympathy. He realized that my misdeeds were due not so much to perversity as to weakness, and this made his friendly soul more ready to help me later on when without him I should assuredly have perished of misery and want.","397. ""One effect of our conversation was to revive my friend's pity for me in all its force.

"Il me restait peu d’argent. C’était, néanmoins, un fondement nécessaire, par lequel il fallait commencer. Je ne voyais que trois personnes de qui j’en pusse attendre : M. de T..., mon père et Tiberge. Il y avait peu d’apparence d’obtenir quelque chose des deux derniers, et j’avais honte de fatiguer l’autre par mes importunités. Mais ce n’est point dans le désespoir qu’on garde des ménagements. J’allai sur-le-champ au Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice, sans m’embarrasser si j’y serais reconnu. Je fis appeler Tiberge. Ses premières paroles me firent comprendre qu’il ignorait encore mes dernières aventures. Cette idée me fit changer le dessein que j’avais, de l’attendrir par la compassion. Je lui parlai, en général, du plaisir que j’avais eu de revoir mon père, et je le priai ensuite de me prêter quelque argent, sous prétexte de payer, avant mon départ de Paris, quelques dettes que je souhaitais de tenir inconnues. Il me présenta aussitôt sa bourse. Je pris cinq cents francs sur six cents que j’y trouvai. Je lui offris mon billet ; il était trop généreux pour l’accepter.","I had little money left. It was, however, a necessary foundation with which to begin. I only saw three people from whom I could expect: M. de T..., my father and Tiberge. There was little prospect of getting anything from the last two, and I was ashamed to tire the other by my importunities. But it is not in desperation that we maintain consideration. I immediately went to the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice, without worrying if I should be recognized there. I sent for Tiberge. His first words made me understand that he was still unaware of my latest adventures. This idea made me change the plan I had, to soften her with compassion. I spoke to him in general of the pleasure I had had in seeing my father again, and then I begged him to lend me some money, under the pretext of paying, before my departure from Paris, some debts which I wished to keep unknown. He immediately presented me with his purse. I took five hundred francs out of the six hundred I found there. I offered him my ticket; he was too generous to accept it.","I had little money left.

Il admira Manon, moi, tout ce qui nous appartenait, et il mangea d’un appétit qui fit honneur à notre souper. Lorsqu’on eut desservi, la conversation devint plus sérieuse. Il baissa les yeux pour nous parler de l’excès où son père s’était porté contre nous. Il nous fit les excuses les plus soumises.","I made no difficulty about anything after such assurances.

"– Ce n’est pas à vos yeux, cher ami, lui dis-je, que je veux paraître ce que je ne suis point. Si vous avez cru trouver ici un ami sage et réglé dans ses désirs, un libertin réveillé par les châtiments du Ciel, en un mot un cœur dégagé de l’amour et revenu des charmes de sa Manon, vous avez jugé trop favorablement de moi. Vous me revoyez tel que vous me laissâtes il y a quatre mois : toujours tendre, et toujours malheureux par cette fatale tendresse dans laquelle je ne me lasse point de chercher mon bonheur.","“It is not in your eyes, dear friend,” I said to him, “that I want to appear what I am not. If you thought you had found a wise friend here, regulated in his desires, a libertine awakened by the chastisements of Heaven, in a word, a heart freed from love and returned from the charms of his Manon, you have judged me too favorably. You see me again as you left me four months ago: still tender, and still unhappy by that fatal tenderness in which I never tire of seeking my happiness.","‘ My dear friend,’ I said, ‘you are not the sort of man before whom I want to appear what I am not. If you think you have come here to see a reformed character, with passions all under control, a libertine whose eyes have been opened by the chastisement of God, in a word a heart purged of desire and no longer ensnared by Manon ’s wiles, you have judged me too indulgently. You see me now just as you left me four months ago, still susceptible, still haunted by that fatal passion, still untiringly seeking happiness there and there alone.’","`It is not from such a friend as you,' said I, `that I can ever wish to dissemble my real feelings.   If you flattered yourself with a hope that you were at last about to find me grown prudent and regular in my conduct, a libertine reclaimed by the chastisements of fortune, released alike from the trammels of love, and the dominion that Manon wields over me, I must in candour say, that you deceive yourself.   You still behold me, as you left me four months ago, the slave--if you will, the unhappy slave--of a passion, from which I now hope, as fervently and as confidently as I ever did, to derive eventually solid comfort.'"
"Je m’efforçai en vain de la consoler par mes caresses ; mes propres pleurs trahissaient mon désespoir et ma consternation. En effet, nous étions ruinés si absolument, qu’il ne nous restait pas une chemise. Je pris le parti d’envoyer chercher sur-le-champ M. Lescaut. Il me conseilla d’aller à l’heure même, chez M. le Lieutenant de Police et M. le Grand Prévôt de Paris. J’y allai, mais ce fut pour mon plus grand malheur ; car outre que cette démarche et celles que je fis faire à ces deux officiers de justice ne produisirent rien, je donnai le temps à Lescaut d’entretenir sa sœur, et de lui inspirer, pendant mon absence, une horrible résolution. Il lui parla de M. de G... M..., vieux voluptueux, qui payait prodiguement les plaisirs, et il lui fit envisager tant d’avantages à se mettre à sa solde, que, troublée comme elle était par notre disgrâce, elle entra dans tout ce qu’il entreprit de lui persuader. Cet honorable marché fut conclu avant mon retour, et l’exécution remise au lendemain, après que Lescaut aurait prévenu M. de G... M... Je le trouvai qui m’attendait au logis ; mais Manon s’était couchée dans son appartement, et elle avait donné ordre à son laquais de me dire qu’ayant besoin d’un peu de repos, elle me priait de la laisser seule pendant cette nuit. Lescaut me quitta, après m’avoir offert quelques pistoles que j’acceptai.","I tried in vain to console her with my caresses; my own tears betrayed my despair and consternation. In fact, we were so absolutely ruined that we had not a shirt left. I decided to send for M. Lescaut immediately. He advised me to go at the same time to the house of the Lieutenant of Police and the Grand Provost of Paris. I went, but it was for my greatest misfortune; for besides the fact that this step and those which I made these two officers of the justice take produced nothing, I gave Lescaut time to talk to his sister, and to inspire in her, during my absence, a horrible resolution. He spoke to her of M. de G... M..., a voluptuous old man, who paid lavishly for pleasures, and he made her consider so many advantages in putting himself in his pay, that, troubled as she was by our disgrace , she entered into whatever he set out to persuade her. This honorable bargain was concluded before my return, and the execution postponed to the next day, after Lescaut had informed M. de G... M... I found him waiting for me at home; but Manon had gone to bed in her apartment, and she had ordered her lackey to tell me that, needing a little rest, she begged me to leave her alone that night. Lescaut left me, after offering me a few pistoles, which I accepted.","I tried vainly to console her with caresses, but my own tears betrayed my consternation and despair. The truth was that we were so completely ruined that we had not a stitch left. The best thing seemed to be to send at once for M. Lescaut. He advised me to go without delay to the Lieutenant of Police and Grand Provost of Paris. I went, but it only served to complete my undoing. This step, and those I got the police to take on my behalf, gained me nothing, and by going out I gave Lescaut time to talk to his sister and put a horrible idea into her head. He told her about M. de G. M., an old voluptuary famous for his liberality where his pleasures were concerned, and he let her see so many advantages in being kept by this man that in her troubled state of mind she entered into everything he liked to suggest. This honourable bargain was concluded before I returned, and the execution of it fixed for the next day, after Lescaut had prepared M. de G. M. When I got back I found him waiting for me, but Manon had retired to her room, having given orders for me to be told that she needed rest and quiet and asked me to leave her alone that night. Lescaut offered me a little money, which I accepted, and then he left.","I endeavoured, in vain, by my entreaties and caresses, to console her.   My own lamentations betrayed my distress and despair.   In fact, we were so completely ruined, that we were bereft almost of decent covering. ""I determined to send off at once for Lescaut.   He advised me to go immediately to the lieutenant of police, and to give information also to the Grand Provost of Paris.   I went, but it was to add to my calamities only; for, independently of my visit producing not the smallest good effect, I, by my absence, allowed Lescaut time for discussion with his sister, during which he did not fail to inspire her with the most horrible resolutions.   He spoke to her about M. G---- M----, an old voluptuary, who paid prodigally for his pleasures; he so glowingly described the advantages of such a connection, that she entered into all his plans.   This discreditable arrangement was all concluded before my return, and the execution of it only postponed till the next morning, after Lescaut should have apprised G---- M----. ""I found him, on my return, waiting for me at my house; but Manon had retired to her own apartment, and she had desired the footman to tell me that, having need of repose, she hoped she should not be disturbed that night.   Lescaut left me, after offering me a few crowns which I accepted."

"– Je puis vous dire, néanmoins, ce que ces misérables n’ignorent point, continua-t-il en montrant les archers, c’est que je l’aime avec une passion si violente qu’elle me rend le plus infortuné de tous les hommes. J’ai tout employé, à Paris, pour obtenir sa liberté. Les sollicitations, l’adresse et la force m’ont été inutiles ; j’ai pris le parti de la suivre, dût-elle aller au bout du monde. Je m’embarquerai avec elle ; je passerai en Amérique. Mais ce qui est de la dernière inhumanité, ces lâches coquins, ajouta-t-il en parlant des archers, ne veulent pas me permettre d’approcher d’elle. Mon dessein était de les attaquer ouvertement, à quelques lieues de Paris. Je m’étais associé quatre hommes qui m’avaient promis leur secours pour une somme considérable. Les traîtres m’ont laissé seul aux mains et sont partis avec mon argent. L’impossibilité de réussir par la force m’a fait mettre les armes bas. J’ai proposé aux archers de me permettre du moins de les suivre en leur offrant de les récompenser. Le désir du gain les y a fait consentir. Ils ont voulu être payés chaque fois qu’ils m’ont accordé la liberté de parler à ma maîtresse. Ma bourse s’est épuisée en peu de temps, et maintenant que je suis sans un sou, ils ont la barbarie de me repousser brutalement lorsque je fais un pas vers elle. Il n’y a qu’un instant, qu’ayant osé m’en approcher malgré leurs menaces, ils ont eu l’insolence de lever contre moi le bout du fusil. Je suis obligé, pour satisfaire leur avarice et pour me mettre en état de continuer la route à pied, de vendre ici un mauvais cheval qui m’a servi jusqu’à présent de monture.","“I can tell you, nevertheless, what these wretches are not unaware of,” he continued, pointing to the archers, “is that I love him with a passion so violent that it makes me the most unfortunate of all. men. I used everything in Paris to obtain his freedom. Solicitations, skill and force have been useless to me; I decided to follow her, even if she had to go to the end of the world. I will embark with her; I will go to America. But what is the ultimate inhumanity, these cowardly rascals, he added, speaking of the archers, will not allow me to approach her. My plan was to attack them openly, a few leagues from Paris. I had associated myself with four men who had promised me their help for a considerable sum. The traitors left me alone in their hands and left with my money. The impossibility of succeeding by force made me lay down my arms. I proposed to the archers to at least allow me to follow them by offering to reward them. The desire for gain made them consent to it. They wanted to be paid every time they gave me the freedom to talk to my mistress. My purse ran out in a short time, and now that I'm penniless, they have the barbarism to push me back brutally when I take a step towards her. Only a moment ago, having dared to approach me despite their threats, they had the insolence to raise the point of the gun against me. I am obliged, in order to satisfy their avarice and to put myself in a condition to continue the journey on foot, to sell here a bad horse which has hitherto served me as a mount.","‘But what I can tell you,’ he went on, pointing to the guards, ‘and those wretches know it all too well, is that I love her so passionately that she has made me the most unhappy man alive. I used every possible means in Paris to get her set free – petitions, intrigues, violence – nothing worked. And so I made up my mind to follow her, if need be to the ends of the earth. I shall embark with her and go to America. But,’ he continued, returning to the subject of the guards, ‘can you imagine anyone more inhuman than those foul creatures? They won’t let me go near her. I had planned to attack them some leagues out from Paris, with the promised help of four men to whom I handed out a large sum. When it came to the fighting, they left me in the lurch and decamped with my money, and so, seeing that I could not succeed by force, I laid down my arms. Then I asked those guards to let me follow them, offering a handsome reward, of course. Their greed made them consent, but every time I have had permission to speak to her I have had to pay. My purse was soon empty, and now that I haven’t a penny left the devils shove me back roughly whenever I take a step in her direction. Only a minute ago I made up my mind to brave their threats and go up to her, and they had the effrontery to raise the butts of their rifles at me. Now I shall have to sell the poor old horse that I have ridden up to now, so as to meet their demands and be able to finish the journey on foot.’","""I may, however, tell you this much, for it is no longer a secret to these wretches,"" he continued, pointing to the guards,--""that I adore her with a passion so ardent and absorbing as to render me the most unhappy of human beings.   I tried every means at Paris to effect her liberty.        Petitions, artifice, force--all failed.   Go where she may, I have resolved to follow her--to the extremity of the world.   I shall embark with her and cross to America. But think of the brutal inhumanity of these cowardly ruffians,"" he added, speaking of the guards; ""they will not allow me to approach her!   I had planned an open attack upon them some leagues from Paris; having secured, as I thought, the aid of four men, who for a considerable sum hired me their services.   The traitors, however, left me to execute my scheme single-handed, and decamped with my money.   The impossibility of success made me of course abandon the attempt, I then implored of the guards permission to follow in their train, promising them a recompense.   The love of money procured their consent; but as they required payment every time I was allowed to speak to her, my purse was speedily emptied; and now that I am utterly penniless, they are barbarous enough to repulse me brutally, whenever I make the slightest attempt to approach her.   It is but a moment since, that venturing to do so, in spite of their threats, one of the fellows raised the butt-end of his musket.   I am now driven by their exactions to dispose of the miserable horse that has brought me hither, and am preparing to continue the journey on foot."""

"– J’avais dix-sept ans, et j’achevais mes études de philosophie à Amiens, où mes parents, qui sont d’une des meilleures maisons de P..., m’avaient envoyé. Je menais une vie si sage et si réglée, que mes maîtres me proposaient pour l’exemple du collège. Non que je fisse des efforts extraordinaires pour mériter cet éloge, mais j’ai l’humeur naturellement douce et tranquille : je m’appliquais à l’étude par inclination, et l’on me comptait pour des vertus quelques marques d’aversion naturelle pour le vice.

"» Ne vous alarmez pas, ajoutai-je en voyant son zèle prêt à se chagriner. L’unique chose que je veux conclure ici, c’est qu’il n’y a point de plus mauvaise méthode pour dégoûter un cœur de l’amour, que de lui en décrier les douceurs et de lui promettre plus de bonheur dans l’exercice de la vertu. De la manière dont nous sommes faits, il est certain que notre félicité consiste dans le plaisir ; je défie qu’on s’en forme une autre idée ; or le cœur n’a pas besoin de se consulter longtemps pour sentir que, de tous les plaisirs, les plus doux sont ceux de l’amour. Il s’aperçoit bientôt qu’on le trompe lorsqu’on lui en promet ailleurs de plus charmants, et cette tromperie le dispose à se défier des promesses les plus solides. Prédicateurs, qui voulez me ramener à la vertu, dites-moi qu’elle est indispensablement nécessaire, mais ne me déguisez pas qu’elle est sévère et pénible. Établissez bien que les délices de l’amour sont passagères, qu’elles sont défendues, qu’elles seront suivies par d’éternelles peines, et ce qui fera peut-être encore plus d’impression sur moi, que, plus elles sont douces et charmantes, plus le Ciel sera magnifique à récompenser un si grand sacrifice, mais confessez qu’avec des cœurs tels que nous les avons, elles sont ici-bas nos plus parfaites félicités.","""Don't be alarmed,"" I added, seeing his zeal ready to falter. The only thing I want to conclude here is that there is no worse way to disgust a heart with love than to decry its sweetness and promise it more happiness in love. exercise of virtue. As we are made, it is certain that our happiness consists in pleasure; I defy anyone to form any other idea of it; now the heart does not need to consult for long to feel that, of all the pleasures, the sweetest are those of love. He soon perceives that he is deceived when he is promised more charming ones elsewhere, and this deception disposes him to mistrust the most solid promises. Preachers, who want to bring me back to virtue, tell me that it is indispensably necessary, but do not disguise that it is severe and painful. Establish well that the delights of love are transient, that they are forbidden, that they will be followed by eternal sorrows, and what will perhaps make an even greater impression on me, that the sweeter they are and charming, the more magnificent Heaven will be in rewarding such a great sacrifice, but confess that with hearts such as we have, they are our most perfect happiness here below.","Seeing signs of righteous anger on his part I went on: ‘Don’t be alarmed; the only conclusion I want to draw from this is that, if you want to cure a lovesick heart, the worst method you can adopt is to decry the joys of love and promise greater happiness in the exercise of virtue. Being made as we are, it is indisputable that our felicity is found in pleasure, and I challenge anyone to define it in any other way. Now the human heart does not need prolonged study to feel that of all pleasures those of love are sweetest, and it very soon perceives that a promise of greater joys elsewhere is a fraud, and a fraud which predisposes it to mistrust the most solemn assurances. Let the preachers who seek to lead me back to virtue say by all means that virtue is necessary and indispensable, but they must not hide the fact that it is austere and painful. Let them establish that the delights of love are ephemeral, forbidden and liable to be followed by eternal punishment, and, what might make a still stronger impression on me, that the more sweet and captivating they are the more magnanimously Heaven will reward such a great sacrifice. But they must allow that with hearts like ours we cannot find more perfect joys here below.’","""`Do not be alarmed,' said I, perceiving that I had almost offended his zealous feelings of devotion.   `I only wish to say, that there is no more unsuccessful method of weaning man's heart from love, than by endeavouring to decry its enjoyments, and by promising him more pleasure from the exercise of virtue.   It is an inherent principle in our nature, that our felicity consists only in pleasure.   I defy you to conceive any other notion of it; and it requires little time to arrive at the conviction, that, of all pleasures, those of love are immeasurably the most enchanting.   A man quickly discerns the delusion, when he hears the promise made of livelier enjoyment, and the effect of such misrepresentation is only to make him doubt the truth of a more solid promise. ""`Let the preacher who seeks the reformation of a sinner tell me that virtue is indispensably necessary, but not disguise its difficulty and its attendant denials.   Say that the enjoyments of love are fleeting, if you will, that they are rigidly forbidden, that they lead with certainty to eternal suffering; and, what would assuredly make a deeper impression upon me than any other argument , say that the more sweet and delectable they are, the brighter will be the reward of Heaven for giving them up in sacrifice; but do in the name of justice admit, that, constituted as the heart of man is, they form here, on earth, our most perfect happiness.'"
"Je passai la nuit et le jour suivant dans cette situation. Je refusai la nourriture qu’on m’apporta le lendemain. Mon père vint me voir l’après-midi. Il eut la bonté de flatter mes peines par les plus douces consolations. Il m’ordonna si absolument de manger quelque chose, que je le fis par respect pour ses ordres. Quelques jours se passèrent, pendant lesquels je ne pris rien qu’en sa présence et pour lui obéir. Il continuait toujours de m’apporter les raisons qui pouvaient me ramener au bon sens et m’inspirer du mépris pour l’infidèle Manon.

He always continued to bring me the reasons that could bring me back to common sense and inspire me with contempt for the unfaithful Manon. It is certain that I no longer esteemed him; how could I have esteemed the most fickle and treacherous of all creatures? But his image, his charming features that I carried in the bottom of my heart, still remained there. I felt it.","All that night and all the following day I refused the food that was brought me.

He persevered in finding arguments calculated to bring me back to my senses and make me see the faithlessness of the despicable Manon. It is quite true that by then I had ceased to respect her virtue – how could I respect anyone so fickle and disloyal? But her picture, her lovely features, were imprinted on my mind for ever. Yet I was not deceived.","In this situation I passed the night and the following day.   I refused the nourishment that was brought to me next morning. ""My father came to see me in the afternoon.

We were not badly covered, in a room at Chaillot, and for future needs, I thought it would be time to think about it when I had satisfied the presents.","I sat down on the grass and launched into a sea of reasoning and arguments which gradually sorted themselves out under three main headings: I needed immediate financial help for countless pressing necessities; I had to find some means of living which would at any rate lead to hopes of future security, and, last but not least, I had to see how the land lay and take steps to guarantee Manon’s personal safety and my own. After having gone through all the plans and calculations I could think of under these three heads, I decided that after all I had better cut out the last two. We were fairly well hidden in our room at Chaillot, and it seemed time enough to think of future needs when I had satisfied the present ones.","I had pressing want of an infinite number of absolute necessaries; I had to seek some mode of at least raising a hope for the future; and, though last, not least in importance, I had to gain information, and adopt measures, to secure Manon's safety and my own.

We were not ill sheltered from observation in the inn at Chaillot; and as to future wants, I thought it would be time enough to think about them when those of the moment were satisfied."
"Deux jours se passèrent sans aucun autre incident. Le troisième fut plus orageux.

Il n’avait eu le temps de les exprimer qu’en baisant amoureusement les caractères, parce qu’elle s’était aussitôt dérobée. Mais elle avait paru d’une gaieté extraordinaire pendant le reste du jour, et depuis qu’elle était rentrée au logis, cette humeur ne l’avait pas abandonnée. Je frémis, sans doute, à chaque mot.","Two days passed without any further incident. The third was more stormy.

He had had time to express them only by lovingly kissing the characters, because she had immediately slipped away.

He had only time to express his delight by kissing the billet-doux, for she was out of sight in an instant.   But she appeared in unusually high spirits the remainder of the day; and even after her return to our lodgings, her gaiety continued.   I trembled at every word."

"Manon quitta mes cheveux, se jeta dans un fauteuil, et fit retentir la chambre de longs éclats de rire. Je ne dissimulerai pas que je fus touché, jusqu’au fond du cœur, d’un sacrifice que je ne pouvais attribuer qu’à l’amour. Cependant la plaisanterie me parut excessive. Je lui en fis des reproches. Elle me raconta que mon rival, après l’avoir observée pendant plusieurs jours au bois de Boulogne, et lui avoir fait deviner ses sentiments par des grimaces, avait pris le parti de lui en faire une déclaration ouverte, accompagnée de son nom et de tous ses titres, dans une lettre qu’il lui avait fait remettre par le cocher qui la conduisait avec ses compagnes ; qu’il lui promettait, au-delà des monts, une brillante fortune et des adorations éternelles ; qu’elle était revenue à Chaillot dans la résolution de me communiquer cette aventure, mais qu’ayant conçu que nous en pouvions tirer de l’amusement, elle n’avait pu résister à son imagination ; qu’elle avait offert au prince italien, par une réponse flatteuse, la liberté de la voir chez elle, et qu’elle s’était fait un second plaisir de me faire entrer dans son plan, sans m’en avoir fait naître le moindre soupçon. Je ne lui dis pas un mot des lumières qui m’étaient venues par une autre voie, et l’ivresse de l’amour triomphant me fit tout approuver.","Manon left my hair, threw herself into an armchair, and made the room resound with long bursts of laughter. I will not hide that I was touched, to the bottom of my heart, by a sacrifice that I could only attribute to love. However, the joke seemed excessive to me. I blamed him. She told me that my rival, after observing her for several days in the Bois de Boulogne, and having made her guess his feelings by grimaces, had made up his mind to make an open declaration to her, accompanied by his name and all her titles, in a letter which he had had delivered to her by the coachman who drove her with her companions; that he promised her, beyond the mountains, a brilliant fortune and eternal adoration; that she had returned to Chaillot with the resolution of communicating this adventure to me, but that having conceived that we could draw some amusement from it, she had been unable to resist her imagination; that she had offered the Italian prince, by a flattering reply, the liberty of seeing her at her house, and that she had given herself a second suspicion. I did not say a word to her about the enlightenment that had come to me by another route, and the intoxication of triumphant love made me approve of everything.","Manon let go of my hair, flung herself into an armchair and the room re-echoed with her peals of laughter. I will not deny that I was touched to the heart by a sacrifice which I could ascribe only to love. All the same, the joke seemed to me a trifle overdone, and I criticized her for it. She told me that my rival, having pestered her for several days in the Bois de Boulogne, and having conveyed his feelings by grimacings, had made up his mind to send a formal declaration, together with his name and a full list of his titles, in a letter he had had delivered by the coachman who drove her and her friends. He had promised her a brilliant fortune and eternal adoration away over the mountains. She had come back to Chaillot intending to tell me the whole story, but, thinking we might get some fun out of it , she had not been able to resist the vision her imagination had conjured up. And so she had sent the Italian prince a flattering reply, giving him free permission to come and see her, and had given herself a second pleasure by making me participate in her plan without having the slightest suspicion.

Still, however, I could not help thinking she had gone rather too far.   I reproached her with what I called her indiscretion.   She told me that my rival, after having besieged her for several days in the Bois de Boulogne, and having made her comprehend his object by signs and grimaces, had actually made an open declaration of love; informing her at the same time of his name and all his titles, by means of a letter, which he had sent through the hands of the coachman who drove her and her companions; that he had promised her, on the other side of the Alps, a brilliant fortune and eternal adoration; that she returned to Chaillot, with the intention of relating to me the whole adventure, but that, fancying it might be made a source of amusement to us, she could not help gratifying her whim; that she accordingly invited the Italian prince, by a flattering note, to pay her a visit; and that it had afforded her equal delight to make me an accomplice, without giving me the least suspicion of her plan.

Your disorders would make her die of pain if she had lived long enough to see them. Let's end this conversation, he added; he annoys me, and will not make me change my resolution. I return home; I order you to follow me.","‘Don’t say another word about your mother,’ he angrily replied; ‘the very thought makes me boil with indignation. If she had lived to see your debaucheries, they would have killed her with grief. That is enough of this talk. It is only making me angry and it will certainly not make me change my decision. I am going home, and I order you to follow me.’","""`Breathe not again the sacred name of your mother,' he exclaimed, in a voice of thunder; `the very allusion to her memory rouses my indignation.   Had she lived to witness the unredeemed profligacy of your life, it would have brought her in pain and sorrow to her grave.--Let us put an end to this discussion' he added; `it distresses me, and makes not the slightest change in my determination: I am going back to my lodgings, and I desire you to follow me.'"
"Son discours me fit trembler. Je jugeai qu’elle était accablée de ses maux. Je m’efforçai de prendre un air plus tranquille, pour lui ôter ces funestes pensées de mort et de désespoir. Je résolus de tenir la même conduite à l’avenir ; et j’ai éprouvé, dans la suite, que rien n’est plus capable d’inspirer du courage à une femme que l’intrépidité d’un homme qu’elle aime.","His speech made me tremble. I judged that she was overwhelmed with her ills. I forced myself to assume a calmer air, to take away from him these fatal thoughts of death and despair. I resolved to follow the same course in the future; and I found afterwards that nothing is more capable of inspiring courage in a woman than the intrepidity of a man she loves.","Her words made me shudder, for it seemed to me that her misfortunes had got the better of her. I therefore tried to assume a calmer manner in order to divert her mind from death and despair. I resolved to keep up the same attitude in the future, and since then I have found nothing succeeds more in putting new heart into a woman than a courageous air in the man she loves.","""Her observations made me tremble.   I saw that she was overpowered by her afflictions.   I tried to assume a more tranquil air, in order to dissipate such melancholy thoughts of death and despair. I resolved to adopt the same course in future; and I learned by the results, that nothing is more calculated to inspire a woman with courage than the demonstration of intrepidity in the man she loves."
"Je reconnus bientôt que j’étais moins enfant que je ne le croyais. Mon cœur s’ouvrit à mille sentiments de plaisir dont je n’avais jamais eu l’idée. Une douce chaleur se répandit dans toutes mes veines. J’étais dans une espèce de transport, qui m’ôta pour quelque temps, la liberté de la voix et qui ne s’exprimait que par mes yeux. Mademoiselle Manon Lescaut, c’est ainsi qu’elle me dit qu’on la nommait, parut fort satisfaite de cet effet de ses charmes. Je crus apercevoir qu’elle n’était pas moins émue que moi. Elle me confessa qu’elle me trouvait aimable et qu’elle serait ravie de m’avoir obligation de sa liberté. Elle voulut savoir qui j’étais, et cette connaissance augmenta son affection, parce qu’étant d’une naissance commune, elle se trouva flattée d’avoir fait la conquête d’un amant tel que moi. Nous nous entretînmes des moyens d’être l’un à l’autre. Après quantité de réflexions, nous ne trouvâmes point d’autre voie que celle de la fuite. Il fallait tromper la vigilance du conducteur, qui était un homme à ménager quoiqu’il ne fût qu’un domestique. Nous réglâmes que je ferais préparer pendant la nuit une chaise de poste, et que je reviendrais de grand matin à l’auberge avant qu’il fût éveillé ; que nous nous déroberions secrètement, et que nous irions droit à Paris, où nous nous ferions marier en arrivant. J’avais environ cinquante écus, qui étaient le fruit de mes petites épargnes ; elle en avait à peu près le double. Nous nous imaginâmes, comme des enfants sans expérience, que cette somme ne finirait jamais, et nous ne comptâmes pas moins sur le succès de nos autres mesures.","I soon realized that I was less of a child than I thought. My heart opened to a thousand feelings of pleasure that I had never imagined. A soft warmth spread through all my veins. I was in a kind of transport, which deprived me for some time of the freedom of voice and which expressed itself only through my eyes. Mademoiselle Manon Lescaut, as she told me she was called, seemed very pleased with this effect of her charms. I thought I saw that she was no less moved than me. She confessed to me that she found me amiable and that she would be delighted to be under obligation to me for her freedom. She wanted to know who I was, and this knowledge increased her affection, because being of common birth, she felt flattered to have made the conquest of a lover such as myself. We talked about ways to be with each other. After much thought, we found no other way but to flee. It was necessary to deceive the vigilance of the driver, who was a man to be spared although he was only a servant. We settled that I should have a post-chaise prepared during the night, and that I should return early in the morning to the inn before he was awake; that we would steal away secretly, and that we would go straight to Paris, where we would get married on our arrival. I had about fifty crowns, which were the fruit of my small savings; she had about twice that. We imagined, like inexperienced children, that this sum would never end, and we counted no less on the success of our other measures.","In a very short time I realized that I was not nearly as callow as I thought. I had all sorts of pleasurable sensations the like of which I had never dreamed of before: a kind of ineffable warmth spread through my whole being and I experienced such overpowering emotion that for some time I could not utter a sound, but only let my passion declare itself through my eyes. Mademoiselle Manon Lescaut (she told me that was her name) seemed gratified by this proof of the power of her charms, and I thought she was as deeply affected as I was. She admitted that she would be overjoyed to owe her freedom to me, for she found me most charming. She then asked who I was, and when I told her, her affection visibly increased because, being of humbler birth, she felt flattered at having such a man as me for a lover. We discussed ways and means of belonging to each other, and after much thought agreed that the only way was to elope. The first thing was to dodge the watchful eye of her man, and, though he was only a hired servant, he was a person to be reckoned with. It was decided that I should hire a post-chaise during the night and bring it round to the inn very early before he woke up; then we would steal away, make straight for Paris and get married as soon as we arrived. I had all my savings, about fifty écus, and she had about twice as much. In our innocence we imagined that this sum would last for ever, and were confident that everything else would be equally satisfactory.","""I soon learned that I was less a child than I had before imagined.   My heart expanded to a thousand sentiments of pleasure, of which I had not before the remotest idea.   A delicious consciousness of enjoyment diffused itself through my whole mind and soul.   I sank into a kind of ecstasy, which deprived me for a time of the power of utterance, and which found vent only in a flood of tears. ""Manon Lescaut (this she told me was her name) seemed gratified by the visible effect of her own charms.   She appeared to me not less excited than myself.   She acknowledged that she was greatly pleased with me, and that she should be enchanted to owe to me her freedom and future happiness.   She would insist on hearing who I was, and the knowledge only augmented her affection; for, being herself of humble birth, she was flattered by securing for her lover a man of family. After many reflections we could discover no other resource than in flight.   To effect this it would be requisite to cheat the vigilance of Manon's guardian, who required management, although he was but a servant.   We determined, therefore, that, during the night, I should procure a post-chaise, and return with it at break of day to the inn, before he was awake; that we should steal away quietly, and go straight to Paris, where we might be married on our arrival.   I had about fifty crowns in my pocket, the fruit of my little savings at school; and she had about twice as much.   We imagined, like inexperienced children, that such a sum could never be exhausted, and we counted, with equal confidence, upon the success of our other schemes."
"Pardonnez, si j’achève en peu de mots un récit qui me tue. Je vous raconte un malheur qui n’eut jamais d’exemple. Toute ma vie est destinée à le pleurer.

It is, I believe, a calamity without parallel.   I can never cease to deplore it.   But although it continues, of course, deeply and indelibly impressed on my memory, yet my heart seems to shrink within me each time that I attempt the recital."
– Quoi donc ? m’écriai-je en la repoussant. Qui ? Quel prince ?,"- What ? I exclaimed, pushing her away. Who ? What prince?","‘What!’ I cried, pushing her away from me, ‘Who? What prince?’",""" `What then,' exclaimed I, as I indignantly pushed her from me, `who?--what prince?'"
"Ma vivacité l’effraya. Il me répondit, d’un air inquiet, que sa pénétration n’avait pas été si loin, mais qu’ayant observé, depuis plusieurs jours, que cet étranger venait assidûment au bois de Boulogne, qu’il y descendait de son carrosse, et que, s’engageant seul dans les contre-allées, il paraissait chercher l’occasion de voir ou de rencontrer mademoiselle, il lui était venu à l’esprit de faire quelque liaison avec ses gens, pour apprendre le nom de leur maître ; qu’ils le traitaient de prince italien, et qu’ils le soupçonnaient eux-mêmes de quelque aventure galante ; qu’il n’avait pu se procurer d’autres lumières, ajouta-t-il en tremblant, parce que le Prince, étant alors sorti du bois, s’était approché familièrement de lui, et lui avait demandé son nom ; après quoi, comme s’il eût deviné qu’il était à notre service, il l’avait félicité d’appartenir à la plus charmante personne du monde.","My liveliness frightened him. He answered me, with a worried air, that his penetration had not gone so far, but that having observed, for several days, that this stranger came assiduously to the Bois de Boulogne, that he alighted there from his carriage, and that, entering the side alleys alone, he seemed to seek an opportunity of seeing or meeting Mademoiselle, it had occurred to him to make some connection with his people, to learn the name of their master; that they treated him as an Italian prince, and that they themselves suspected him of some gallant adventure; that he had been unable to procure any other lights, he added, trembling, because the Prince, having then come out of the wood, had approached him familiarly, and asked his name; after which, as if he had guessed that he was in our service, he had congratulated him on belonging to the most charming person in the world.","The violence of my tone unnerved him, and he answered that he had not been able to see into things as deeply as that. He did say, however, that for some days past he had noticed that this stranger was assiduous in his visits to the Bois de Boulogne, and that he had made a habit of leaving his carriage and walking alone among the trees, apparently looking out for a chance to see or meet Mademoiselle. My servant had therefore decided to strike up an acquaintance with the gentleman’s servants so as to find out his name. To the best of their knowledge he was an Italian prince, and they suspected that he was up to some amorous intrigue. He added nervously that he had not been able to find out anything else because at that moment the prince had emerged from the wood, come up to him without ceremony and asked him his name, and, as if he guessed he belonged to us, had congratulated him on being in the service of the most charming person in the world.","I enquired, interrupting my informant with more impatience than was requisite, if I desired to have a full explanation. ""He was alarmed at my excitement; and replied in an undecided tone, that he had not made sufficiently minute observation to satisfy me; but that, having noticed for several days together the regular arrival of the stranger at the Bois de Boulogne, where, quitting his carriage, he walked by himself in the cross-avenues, appearing to seek opportunities of meeting Manon, it had occurred to him to form an acquaintance with the servants, in order to discover the name of their master; that they spoke of him as an Italian prince, and that they also suspected he was upon some adventure of gallantry.   He had not been able to learn anything further, he added, trembling as he spoke, because the prince, then on the point of leaving the wood, had approached him, and with the most condescending familiarity asked his name; upon which, as if he at once knew that he was in our service, he congratulated him on having, for his mistress, the most enchanting person upon earth."
"– Il faut bien que je sois coupable, me dit-elle tristement, puisque j’ai pu vous causer tant de douleur et d’émotion ; mais que le Ciel me punisse si j’ai cru l’être, ou si j’ai eu la pensée de le devenir !","“I must be guilty,” she said to me sadly, “since I have been able to cause you so much pain and emotion; but may Heaven punish me if I thought I was, or if I thought of becoming one!","I suppose I must be very wicked,’ she mused sadly, ‘since I have given you such pain and grief, but may Heaven punish me if I thought I was, or even dreamed of becoming so.’","`I must have indeed done something most culpable,' said she, sobbing with grief, `to have excited and annoyed you to this degree; but, I call Heaven to attest my utter unconsciousness of crime, and my innocence of all criminal intention!'"
"– Voilà un fils, dis-je à Manon, bien autrement généreux que son père. Parlons de bonne foi, ajoutai-je ; cette offre ne vous tente-t-elle point ?","“Here is a son,” I said to Manon, much more generous than his father. Let us speak in good faith, I added; does this offer not tempt you?","‘Here we have a son very much more generous than his father,’ I said. ‘Now, honestly, doesn’t this offer tempt you just a little?’","""`There is indeed a son,' said I, `very different from his father! But tell me truly, now, does not such an offer tempt you?'"
"– Je me rends justice, monsieur lui dis-je. Je confesse que la jeunesse m’a fait commettre de grandes fautes, et que vous en êtes assez blessé pour vous plaindre. Mais, si vous connaissez la force de l’amour, si vous pouvez juger de ce que souffre un malheureux jeune homme à qui l’on enlève tout ce qu’il aime, vous me trouverez peut-être pardonnable d’avoir cherché le plaisir d’une petite vengeance, ou du moins, vous me croirez assez puni par l’affront que je viens de recevoir. Il n’est besoin ni de prison ni de supplice pour me forcer de vous découvrir où est monsieur votre fils. Il est en sûreté. Mon dessein n’a pas été de lui nuire ni de vous offenser. Je suis prêt à vous nommer le lieu où il passe tranquillement la nuit, si vous me faites la grâce de nous accorder la liberté.","“I do myself justice, sir,” I said to him. I confess that my youth made me commit great faults, and that you are hurt enough to complain. But, if you know the power of love, if you can judge what an unfortunate young man suffers from when everything he loves is taken away, you will perhaps find me pardonable for having sought pleasure. of a little revenge, or at least, you will believe me sufficiently punished by the affront which I have just received. There is no need of prison or punishment to force me to find out to you where your son is. He is safe. My intention was not to harm him or offend you. I am ready to name to you the place where he quietly spends the night, if you will do me the grace to grant us freedom.","‘I see my faults in their true light, Sir,’ I said, ‘and admit that my youth has led me to commit grave offences, and that you have grounds for complaint after having been so wronged. But if you know the power of love, if you can conceive what a poor young man must be suffering when all he has in the world is being taken away from him, you will perhaps think I might be forgiven for having tried to enjoy some slight revenge, or at least that I have been punished enough by the humiliation I have just been through. There is no need for prison or torture to discover your son’s whereabouts. He is in safe hands. I had no intention of hurting him or offending you. If you will do me the favour of setting us free, I am prepared to name the place where he is spending a peaceful night.’","`I wish to do myself but common justice, sir,' said I to him; `I admit that my youth has led me into egregious follies; and that you have had fair reason to complain: but if you have ever felt the resistless power of love, if you can enter into the sufferings of an unhappy young man, from whom all that he most loved was ravished, you may think me perhaps not so culpable in seeking the gratification of an innocent revenge; or at least, you may consider me sufficiently punished, by the exposure and degradation I have just now endured.   Neither pains nor imprisonment will be requisite to make me tell you where your son now is.   He is in perfect safety.   It was never my intention to injure him, nor to give you just cause for offence.   I am ready to let you know the place where he is safely passing the night, if, in return, you will set us at liberty.'"
"Une heure après, je vis entrer l’aumônier chez moi. Je m’imaginai qu’il venait me donner quelques instructions sur mon mariage ; mais, après m’avoir salué froidement, il me déclara, en deux mots, que M. le gouverneur me défendait d’y penser, et qu’il avait d’autres vues sur Manon.","An hour later, I saw the chaplain come into my house.

"Ces pensées me remirent un peu le cœur et la tête. Je résolus d’abord d’aller consulter M. Lescaut, frère de Manon. Il connaissait parfaitement Paris, et je n’avais eu que trop d’occasions de reconnaître que ce n’était ni de son bien ni de la paie du roi qu’il tirait son plus clair revenu. Il me restait à peine vingt pistoles qui s’étaient trouvées heureusement dans ma poche. Je lui montrai ma bourse, en lui expliquant mon malheur et mes craintes, et je lui demandai s’il y avait pour moi un parti à choisir entre celui de mourir de faim, ou de me casser la tête de désespoir. Il me répondit que se casser la tête était la ressource des sots ; pour mourir de faim, qu’il y avait quantité de gens d’esprit qui s’y voyaient réduits, quand ils ne voulaient pas faire usage de leurs talents ; que c’était à moi d’examiner de quoi j’étais capable ; qu’il m’assurait de son secours et de ses conseils dans toutes mes entreprises.","These thoughts cheered me up a bit. I resolved first to go and consult M. Lescaut, Manon's brother. He knew Paris perfectly, and I had had only too many occasions to recognize that it was neither from his property nor from the King's pay that he drew his clearest income. I barely had twenty pistoles left, which had fortunately been in my pocket. I showed him my purse, explaining to him my misfortune and my fears, and I asked him if there was a course for me to choose between that of starving to death or breaking my head in despair. He replied that racking his brains was the resource of fools; to die of hunger, that there were a number of clever people who saw themselves reduced to it, when they did not want to make use of their talents; that it was up to me to see what I was capable of; that he assured me of his help and advice in all my undertakings.","These reflections put a little heart back in me and cleared my mind. I decided to begin by consulting Lescaut, Manon’s brother. He knew his Paris inside out, and it had been all too clearly borne in on me that his main source of income could be neither his property nor his army pay. All I had left was about twenty pistoles that fortunately I had in my pocket. I showed him my purse, described my mishap and my fears, and asked him if there was any choice open to me apart from dying of hunger or taking my own life. He answered that suicide was the last resort of fools, and, as for dying of hunger, plenty of clever people found themselves in that predicament if they were not prepared to use their wits. It was up to me to find out what I was capable of, and I could count on his advice and help in anything I undertook.","""These thoughts restored me a little to my spirits and to my reason.   I determined first to consult M. Lescaut, the brother of Manon.   He knew Paris perfectly; and I had too many opportunities of learning that it was neither from his own estates, nor from the king's pay, that he derived the principal portion of his income.   I had about thirty-three crowns left, which I fortunately happened to have about me.   I showed him my purse, and explained to him my misfortune and my fears, and then asked him whether I had any alternative between starvation and blowing out my brains in despair.   He coolly replied that suicide was the resource of fools.   As to dying of want, there were hundreds of men of genius who found themselves reduced to that state when they would not employ their talents; that it was for myself to discover what I was capable of doing, and he told me to reckon upon his assistance and his advice in any enterprise I might undertake."
"– Dieux ! me dit le garde du corps, qui paraissait aussi éperdu que moi de cette infâme désertion, qu’allons-nous faire ? Nous ne sommes que deux. J’avais perdu la voix, de fureur et d’étonnement. Je m’arrêtai, incertain si ma première vengeance ne devait pas s’employer à la poursuite et au châtiment des lâches qui m’abandonnaient. Je les regardais fuir et je jetais les yeux, de l’autre côté, sur les archers. S’il m’eût été possible de me partager, j’aurais fondu tout à la fois sur ces deux objets de ma rage ; je les dévorais tous ensemble. Le garde du corps, qui jugeait de mon incertitude par le mouvement égaré de mes yeux, me pria d’écouter son conseil.","- Gods ! said the bodyguard to me, who seemed as distraught as I was at this infamous desertion, what are we going to do?

I watched them flee and cast my eyes on the other side at the archers. If it had been possible for me to share myself, I would have melted at the same time on these two objects of my rage; I devoured them all together. The bodyguard, who judged of my uncertainty by the wild movement of my eyes, begged me to listen to his advice.","‘My God!’ said the guardsman, as panic-stricken as I was by such an infamous desertion, ‘what are we to do now? There are only two of us.’ I was speechless with rage and astonishment, and pulled up, uncertain whether my first revenge ought to be to pursue the wretches who had left me in the lurch. I watched them galloping out of sight and then glanced at the guards. Had I been able to cut myself in two, I would have charged simultaneously on these two objects of my rage and destroyed them together. The guardsman could tell the dilemma I was in by the shifting of my eyes, and he urged me to listen to him: ‘There are only two of us,’ he said, ‘and it would be madness to attack six men as well armed as we are ourselves and apparently determined to make a stand.","""`Good heavens!' said the guardsman, who appeared as much annoyed as I was by this infamous desertion, `what is to be done? we are but two now.'

Je l’aimais avec trop de simplicité pour m’alarmer facilement.,I loved him with too much simplicity to be easily alarmed.,I loved her too singleheartedly to be easily disturbed by suspicions.,I loved her too purely to experience the slightest suspicion.
"Ainsi, pendant les premières semaines, je ne pensai qu’à jouir de ma situation ; et la force de l’honneur autant qu’un reste de ménagement pour la police, me faisait remettre de jour en jour à renouer avec les associés de l’hôtel de T..., je me réduisis à jouer dans quelques assemblées moins décriées, où ma faveur du sort m’épargna l’humiliation d’avoir recours à l’industrie. J’allais passer à la ville une partie de l’après-midi, et je revenais souper à Chaillot, accompagné fort souvent de M. de T..., dont l’amitié croissait de jour en jour pour nous. Manon trouva des ressources contre l’ennui. Elle se lia, dans le voisinage, avec quelques jeunes personnes que le printemps y avait ramenées. La promenade et les petits exercices de leur sexe faisaient alternativement leur occupation. Une partie de jeu, dont elles avaient réglé les bornes, fournissait aux frais de la voiture. Elles allaient prendre l’air au bois de Boulogne, et le soir, à mon retour, je retrouvais Manon plus belle, plus contente, et plus passionnée que jamais.","Thus, during the first weeks, I thought only of enjoying my situation; and the force of honor as much as a remnant of consideration for the police, made me put off day by day to reconnect with the associates of the Hôtel de T..., I reduced myself to playing in a few less decried assemblies , where my favor of fate spared me the humiliation of having recourse to industry. I was going to spend part of the afternoon in town, and I was returning to supper at Chaillot, very often accompanied by M. de T..., whose friendship for us grew day by day. Manon found resources against boredom. She made friends in the neighborhood with some young people whom the spring had brought back. The walk and the little exercises of their sex were alternately their occupation. A game of gambling, the limits of which they had regulated, supplied the cost of the carriage. They were going to take the air in the Bois de Boulogne, and in the evening, on my return, I found Manon more beautiful, happier, and more passionate than ever.","And so for the first few weeks my only concern was to get the most enjoyment I could out of the situation. It was as much my sense of honour as a lingering respect for the police that made me put off from day to day renewing my old relationship with the fraternity at the Hôtel de Transylvanie. I restricted my activities to playing in a few less notorious haunts, where good luck spared me the humiliation of having to resort to sharping. I spent part of each afternoon in town, returning to Chaillot for supper, as often as not with M. de T. whose friendship for us grew more intimate every day. Manon found ways of combating boredom. With the coming of spring some of the young ladies had returned to the district, and she struck up an acquaintance with them. They divided their time between little excursions and trivial feminine occupations, and defrayed the cost of the carriage by arranging gambling parties with strictly limited stakes. They used to go and take the air in the Bois de Boulogne, and when I came home in the evenings it was to find Manon happier and more devoted to me than ever.","VIII This Passion hath its floods in the very times of weakness, which are great prosperity, and great adversity; both which times kindle Love, and make it more fervent.--BACON. ""For several weeks I thus continued to think only of enjoying the full luxury of my situation; and being restrained, by a sense of honour, as well as a lurking apprehension of the police, from renewing my intimacy with my former companions at the hotel of Transylvania, I began to play in certain coteries less notorious, where my good luck rendered it unnecessary for me to have recourse to my former accomplishments.   I passed a part of the afternoon in town, and returned always to supper at Chaillot, accompanied very often by M. de T----, whose intimacy and friendship for us daily increased. ""Manon soon found resources against ennui.   She became acquainted with some young ladies, whom the spring brought into the neighbourhood.   They occupied their leisure hours in walking, and the customary amusements of persons of their sex and age.   Their little gains at cards (always within innocent limits) were laid out in defraying the expense of a coach, in which they took an airing occasionally in the Bois de Boulogne; and each night when I returned, I was sure of finding Manon more beautiful--more contented--more affectionate than ever."
"Nous étions demeurés un jour à Paris, pour y coucher comme il nous arrivait fort souvent. La servante, qui restait seule à Chaillot dans ces occasions, vint m’avertir, le matin, que le feu avait pris, pendant la nuit, dans ma maison, et qu’on avait eu beaucoup de difficulté à l’éteindre. Je lui demandai si nos meubles avaient souffert quelque dommage ; elle me répondit qu’il y avait eu une si grande confusion, causée par la multitude d’étrangers qui étaient venus au secours, qu’elle ne pouvait être assurée de rien. Je tremblai pour notre argent, qui était renfermé dans une petite caisse. Je me rendis promptement à Chaillot. Diligence inutile ; la caisse avait déjà disparu. J’éprouvai alors qu’on peut aimer l’argent sans être avare. Cette perte me pénétra d’une si vive douleur que j’en pensai perdre la raison. Je compris tout d’un coup à quels nouveaux malheurs j’allais me trouver exposé ; l’indigence était le moindre. Je connaissais Manon ; je n’avais déjà que trop éprouvé que, quelque fidèle et quelque attachée qu’elle me fût dans la bonne fortune, il ne fallait pas compter sur elle dans la misère. Elle aimait trop l’abondance et les plaisirs pour me les sacrifier :","We had stayed one day in Paris, to sleep there, as we often did. The servant, who remained alone at Chaillot on these occasions, came to tell me in the morning that the fire had broken out during the night in my house, and that it had been very difficult to put it out. I asked him if our furniture had suffered any damage; she replied that there had been such great confusion, caused by the multitude of strangers who had come to help, that she could not be certain of anything. I trembled for our money, which was kept in a small cash box. I promptly went to Chaillot. Unnecessary diligence; the crate had already disappeared. I felt then that one can love money without being miserly. This loss filled me with such intense pain that I thought I was losing my mind. I understood all of a sudden what new misfortunes I was about to find myself exposed to; poverty was the least. I knew Manon; I had already felt only too well that, however faithful and attached she was to me in good fortune, I should not count on her in misery. She loved abundance and pleasures too much to sacrifice them to me:","One night we had slept in Paris, as we often did. In the morning our servant, who on these occasions stayed alone at Chaillot, came and told me that fire had broken out in my house during the night and had been extinguished only with great difficulty. I asked her whether the furniture had been damaged, and she said that there had been such confusion, owing to the crowds of folk who had come offering help, that she could not be sure of anything. I trembled for our money which was kept in a little coffer, and went off to Chaillot with all speed. No need to hurry: it had already gone. At that moment I understood how you can love money without necessarily being a miser. The loss nearly drove me out of my mind. In a flash I could see all the fresh evils I should be exposed to, and poverty was far from being the worst. I knew my Manon; experience had already taught me all too clearly that, however attached to me she might be when things went well, it was no use counting on her in hard times. She was too fond of wealth and pleasure to give them up for me.","""One night we stopped in Paris to sleep, as it had now indeed become our constant habit.   The servant-maid who on such occasions remained alone at Chaillot, came early the next morning to inform me that our house had taken fire in the night, and that the flames had been extinguished with great difficulty.   I asked whether the furniture had suffered.   She answered, that there had been such confusion, owing to the multitude of strangers who came to offer assistance, that she could hardly ascertain what damage had been done.   I was principally uneasy about our money, which had been locked up in a little box.   I went off in haste to Chaillot.   Vain hope! the box had disappeared! ""I discovered that one could love money without being a miser.   This loss afflicted me to such a degree that I was almost out of my mind.   I saw at one glance to what new calamities I should be exposed: poverty was the least of them.   I knew Manon thoroughly; I had already had abundant proof that, although faithful and attached to me under happier circumstances, she could not be depended upon in want: pleasure and plenty she loved too well to sacrifice them for my sake.

"Ce transport, dont je ne fus pas le maître, faillit de m’attirer un fâcheux embarras. Le cocher fit réflexion à mon langage, et lorsque je lui dis ensuite le nom de la rue où nous voulions être conduits, il me répondit qu’il craignait que je ne l’engageasse dans une mauvaise affaire, qu’il voyait bien que ce beau jeune homme, qui s’appelait Manon, était une fille que j’enlevais de l’Hôpital, et qu’il n’était pas d’humeur à se perdre pour l’amour de moi. La délicatesse de ce coquin n’était qu’une envie de me faire payer la voiture plus cher. Nous étions trop près de l’Hôpital pour ne pas filer doux.","This transport, of which I was not the master, nearly caused me an unfortunate embarrassment. The coachman reflected on my language, and when I then told him the name of the street where we wanted to be taken, he replied that he was afraid that I was engaging him in a bad business, that he saw very well that this handsome young man, whose name was Manon, was a girl whom I took from the Hospital, and he was in no mood to lose himself for love of me. The delicacy of this rascal was only a desire to make me pay more for the car. We were too close to the hospital not to take it easy.","This involuntary flourish nearly landed me in a nasty mess. The coachman noticed my language, and when I went on to tell him the name of the street to which we wanted to be taken, he answered that he was afraid I was letting him in for some shady business; that it was plain to see that this pretty young man, whose name was Manon, was a girl I was smuggling out of the Hôpital; that he was not feeling in the mood to get himself into trouble for love of me. This fellow’s scruples were merely a desire to make me pay more for the carriage. We were too near the Hôpital not to go warily. ‘ Be quiet!’","""This burst, which I could not control, was near bringing me into fresh trouble.   The coachman reflected upon what I said, and when I afterwards told him the name of the street to which I wished him to drive, he answered that he feared I was about to implicate him in some bad business; that he saw plainly enough that the good- looking young man whom I called Manon was a girl eloping from the Hospital, and that he was little disposed indeed to ruin himself for love of me. ""Extortion was the source of this scoundrel's delicacy.   We were still too near the Hospital to make any noise.  "
"– Manon, que ferons-nous ? lui dis-je lorsqu’elle eut repris un peu de force. Hélas ! qu’allons-nous faire ? Il faut nécessairement que je m’éloigne. Voulez-vous demeurer dans la ville ? Oui, demeurez-y. Vous pouvez encore y être heureuse ; et moi je vais, loin de vous, chercher la mort parmi les sauvages ou entre les griffes des bêtes féroces.","– Manon, what will we do? I said to her when she had regained some strength. Alas! what are we going to do ? Of course I have to get away. Do you want to stay in the city? Yes, stay there. You can still be happy there; and I am going, far from you, to seek death among the savages or between the claws of ferocious beasts.","‘Manon, what are we to do?’ I said, when she was a little more herself again. ‘What are we to do? I must go away from here. Do you want to stay in the town? Yes, you stay here. You may still find happiness, and I shall go far away and seek death at the hands of savages or from the claws of wild beasts.’","`Manon,' said I to her, when she had recovered a little, `what shall we do?   Alas, what hope remains to us?   I must necessarily fly.   Will you remain in the town?   Yes dearest Manon, do remain; you may possibly still be happy here; while I, far away from you, may seek death and find it amongst the savages, or the wild beasts.'"
"Ma malheureuse maîtresse fut donc enlevée, à mes yeux, et menée dans une retraite que j’ai horreur de nommer. Quel sort pour une créature toute charmante, qui eût occupé le premier trône du monde, si tous les hommes eussent eu mes yeux et mon cœur ! On ne l’y traita pas barbarement ; mais elle fut resserrée dans une étroite prison, seule, et condamnée à remplir tous les jours une certaine tâche de travail, comme une condition nécessaire pour obtenir quelque dégoûtante nourriture. Je n’appris ce triste détail que longtemps après, lorsque j’eus essuyé moi-même plusieurs mois d’une rude et ennuyeuse pénitence. Mes gardes ne m’ayant point averti non plus du lieu où ils avaient ordre de me conduire, je ne connus mon destin qu’à la porte de Saint-Lazare. J’aurais préféré la mort, dans ce moment, à l’état où je me crus prêt de tomber. J’avais de terribles idées de cette maison. Ma frayeur augmenta lorsqu’en entrant les gardes visitèrent une seconde fois mes poches, pour s’assurer qu’il ne me restait ni armes, ni moyen de défense. Le supérieur parut à l’instant ; il était prévenu sur mon arrivée ; il me salua avec beaucoup de douceur.","My unfortunate mistress was therefore kidnapped, in my eyes, and led to a retreat which I hate to name. What a fate for a most charming creature, who would have occupied the first throne in the world, if all men had had my eyes and my heart! He was not treated barbarously there; but she was confined in a narrow prison, alone, and condemned to perform a certain task of labor every day, as a necessary condition for obtaining some disgusting food. I did not learn of this sad detail until long after, when I myself had endured several months of harsh and tiresome penance. Nor having my guards informed me of the place to which they had orders to take me, I did not know my fate until the gate of Saint-Lazare. I would have preferred death, at that moment, to the state in which I thought I was ready to fall. I had terrible ideas of this house. My fear increased when on entering the guards visited my pockets a second time, to make sure that I had neither weapons nor means of defense left. The Superior appeared instantly; he was informed of my arrival; he greeted me very gently.","My unhappy mistress had been taken off and put into an institution which I cannot name without horror.12 What a fate for the most beautiful of women, who, if all men had my eyes and heart, might have sat on the most exalted throne in the world! She was not roughly treated, but confined alone in a narrow prison and condemned to perform some menial task every day as a necessary condition for obtaining some revolting food. All this I learned only long afterwards, when I myself had undergone several months of cruel and monotonous punishment. As the guards had not told me where they had orders to take me, I found out my destination only at the very gates of Saint-Lazare. I had such terrible ideas about this place that at that moment I would have preferred death to the fate I believed to be in store for me.13 My fears were redoubled at the entrance, when the guards went through my pockets for the second time to make sure that I had no weapons or means of defence. My arrival was reported to the Father Superior, who came at once and greeted me very kindly.","""My unhappy mistress was dragged then from my presence, and taken to a place the very name of which fills me with horror to remember.   This to be the lot of a creature the most perfect, who must have shared the most splendid throne on earth, if other men had only seen and felt as I did!   She was not treated harshly there, but was shut up in a narrow prison, and obliged, in solitary confinement, to perform a certain quantity of work each day, as a necessary condition for obtaining the most unpalatable food.   I did not learn this till a long time after, when I had myself endured some months of rough and cruel treatment.

I would have preferred death, at that moment, to the state into which I believed myself about to be thrown.   I had the utmost terror of this place.   My misery was increased by the guards on my entrance, examining once more my pockets, to ascertain whether I had about me any arms or weapons of defence. ""The governor appeared.   He had been informed of my apprehension.   He saluted me with great mildness.  "

"– Écoutez, Manon, lui répondis-je en l’embrassant, je ne puis vous cacher que j’ai le cœur mortellement affligé. Je ne parle point à présent des alarmes où votre fuite imprévue m’a jeté, ni de la cruauté que vous avez eue de m’abandonner sans un mot de consolation, après avoir passé la nuit dans un autre lit que moi. Le charme de votre présence m’en ferait bien oublier davantage. Mais croyez-vous que je puisse penser sans soupirs, et même sans larmes, continuai-je en en versant quelques-unes à la triste et malheureuse vie que vous voulez que je mène dans cette maison ? Laissons ma naissance et mon honneur à part : ce ne sont plus des raisons si faibles qui doivent entrer en concurrence avec un amour tel que le mien ; mais cet amour même, ne vous imaginez-vous pas qu’il gémit de se voir si mal récompensé, ou plutôt traité si cruellement par une ingrate et dure maîtresse ?...","“Listen, Manon,” I replied, kissing her, “I cannot hide from you that my heart is mortally afflicted. I am not speaking now of the alarms into which your unforeseen flight threw me, nor of the cruelty you had in abandoning me without a word of consolation, after having spent the night in another bed than me. The charm of your presence would make me forget even more. But do you think I can think without sighing, and even without tears, I continued, shedding a few of the sad and unhappy life you want me to lead in this house? Let's leave my birth and my honor apart: these are no longer such feeble reasons that must compete with a love such as mine; but this very love, do you not imagine that it groans at seeing itself so poorly rewarded, or rather treated so cruelly by an ungrateful and harsh mistress?...","‘Listen, Manon,’ I said, taking her in my arms, ‘it’s no use pretending that I am not cut to the heart, for I am. I am not referring now to the shock your unexpected flight gave me, nor to your cruelty in leaving me without one word of comfort after spending the night in another bed than mine. All that and much more besides would be charmed away by your mere presence. But do you suppose I can contemplate the miserable, degrading life you want me to live in this house without being upset even to the point of tears?’ I was weeping myself by now. ‘ Let us leave my honour and station in life out of this,’ I went on; ‘little things like that have long ceased to have power to compete with a love like mine. But can’t you see that it is this very love of mine that is groaning at being so ill rewarded, or rather so brutally ill-treated by a callous and ungrateful mistress?’","""`Hearken to me, Manon,' said I, embracing her; `I cannot conceal from you that my heart is bitterly afflicted.   I do not now allude to the uneasiness your sudden flight caused me, nor to the unkindness of quitting me without a word of consolation, after having passed the night away from me.   The pleasure of seeing you again would more than compensate for all; but do you imagine that I can reflect without sighs and tears upon the degrading and unhappy life which you now wish me to lead in this house?   Say nothing of my birth, or of my feelings of honour; love like mine derives no aid from arguments of that feeble nature; but do you imagine that I can without emotion see my love so badly recompensed, or rather so cruelly treated, by an ungrateful and unfeeling mistress?'"

"Vous dirai-je quel fut le déplorable sujet de mes entretiens avec Manon pendant cette route, ou quelle impression sa vue fit sur moi lorsque j’eus obtenu des gardes la liberté d’approcher de son chariot ? Ah ! les expressions ne rendent jamais qu’à demi les sentiments du cœur. Mais figurez-vous ma pauvre maîtresse enchaînée par le milieu du corps, assise sur quelques poignées de paille, la tête appuyée languissamment sur un côté de la voiture, le visage pâle et mouillé d’un ruisseau de larmes qui se faisaient un passage au travers de ses paupières, quoiqu’elle eût continuellement les yeux fermés. Elle n’avait pas même eu la curiosité de les ouvrir lorsqu’elle avait entendu le bruit de ses gardes, qui craignaient d’être attaqués. Son linge était sale et dérangé, ses mains délicates exposées à l’injure de l’air ; enfin, tout ce composé charmant, cette figure capable de ramener l’univers à l’idolâtrie, paraissait dans un désordre et un abattement inexprimables. J’employai quelque temps à la considérer en allant à cheval à côté du chariot. J’étais si peu à moi-même que je fus sur le point, plusieurs fois, de tomber dangereusement. Mes soupirs et mes exclamations fréquentes m’attirèrent d’elle quelques regards.

Ah! expressions never more than half render the sentiments of the heart. But imagine my poor mistress, chained down the middle of her body, seated on a few handfuls of straw, her head leaning languidly on one side of the carriage, her face pale and wet with a stream of tears that made their way through of her eyelids, although her eyes were continually closed. She hadn't even had the curiosity to open them when she heard the noise of her guards, who were afraid of being attacked. Her linen was dirty and disheveled, her delicate hands exposed to the insult of the air; finally, all this charming composition, this figure capable of leading the universe back to idolatry, appeared in inexpressible disorder and dejection.

She had been too listless to open them, even when she had heard the noise made by the guards when they were afraid of being attacked. Her clothes were dirty and disordered and her delicate hands exposed to wind and weather. That enchanting frame, that face capable of taking the whole world back to the days of idolatry, was reduced to an indescribable state of slovenliness and neglect. For some time I rode by the side of the cart and gazed at her. I had so little control of my emotions that more than once I nearly had a bad fall.

She had not even the curiosity to open her eyes on hearing the bustle of the guards when they expected our attack.

La joie de la retrouver ne l’emportait pas tout à fait sur le chagrin de son infidélité. Elle, au contraire, paraissait transportée du plaisir de me revoir. Elle me fit des reproches de ma froideur.

"Quoique je n’eusse pas eu le moindre doute du succès de ma demande, je fus surpris de l’avoir obtenue à si bon marché, c’est-à-dire sans qu’il m’eût querellé sur mon impénitence. Mais je me trompais, en me croyant tout à fait quitte de ses reproches, car lorsqu’il eut achevé de me compter son argent et que je me préparais à le quitter, il me pria de faire avec lui un tour d’allée. Je ne lui avais point parlé de Manon ; il ignorait qu’elle fût en liberté ; ainsi sa morale ne tomba que sur la fuite téméraire de Saint-Lazare et sur la crainte où il était qu’au lieu de profiter des leçons de sagesse que j’y avais reçues, je ne reprisse le train du désordre. Il me dit qu’étant allé pour me visiter à Saint-Lazare, le lendemain de mon évasion, il avait été frappé au-delà de toute expression en apprenant la manière dont j’en étais sorti ; qu’il avait eu là-dessus un entretien avec le Supérieur ; que ce bon père n’était pas encore remis de son effroi ; qu’il avait eu néanmoins la générosité de déguiser à M. le lieutenant général de police les circonstances de mon départ, et qu’il avait empêché que la mort du portier ne fût connue au dehors ; que je n’avais donc, de ce côté-là, nul sujet d’alarme, mais que, s’il me restait le moindre sentiment de sagesse, je profiterais de cet heureux tour que le Ciel donnait à mes affaires ; que je devais commencer par écrire à mon père, et me remettre bien avec lui ; et que, si je voulais suivre une fois son conseil, il était d’avis que je quittasse Paris, pour retourner dans le sein de ma famille.","Although I had not had the slightest doubt of the success of my request, I was surprised to have obtained it so cheaply, that is to say, without his having quarreled with me on my impenitence. But I was mistaken, in thinking myself quite clear of his reproaches, for when he had finished counting out his money and I was preparing to leave him, he asked me to take a walk with him. I had not spoken to him about Manon; he did not know that she was at liberty; thus his moral fell only on the reckless flight from Saint-Lazare and on the fear in which he was that instead of profiting by the lessons of wisdom which I had received there, I would resume the train of disorder. He told me that, having gone to visit me at Saint-Lazare, the day after my escape, he had been struck beyond expression on learning the manner in which I had escaped; that he had had an interview on this subject with the Superior; that this good father had not yet recovered from his fright; that he had nevertheless had the generosity to disguise the circumstances of my departure from the Lieutenant-General of Police, and that he had prevented the porter's death from becoming known outside; that I had therefore, on that side, no cause for alarm, but that, if I had the slightest feeling of wisdom left, I would profit by this happy turn which Heaven gave to my affairs; that I should begin by writing to my father, and get on well with him; and that, if I wanted to follow his advice once, he was of the opinion that I should leave Paris, to return to the bosom of my family.","Although I had never for a moment doubted that my appeal would succeed, I was surprised to have got what I wanted with so little trouble, that is to say without hard words from him on my impenitence. But I made a mistake in thinking that I could get away scot-free and without any criticism, for when he had finished counting out the money, and I was getting ready to leave him, he asked me to take a stroll with him round a path in the park. I had not mentioned Manon’s name, and he did not know that she was at large, and so his sermon was concerned only with my escape from Saint-Lazare and his fear that I might relapse into my evil ways instead of profiting by the lessons in wisdom I had been given in prison. He told me that having been to see me at Saint-Lazare on the day after my escape he had been horrified beyond words to learn how I had taken my departure; he had had a talk with the Superior, who had not yet recovered from his shock. The good Father had nevertheless been generous enough to keep the circumstances of my going from the knowledge of the police, and had thus prevented the news of the porter’s death from being known outside. I therefore had no grounds for alarm on that score; but if I had any decent feelings left I would learn my lesson from the fortunate turn things had taken, thanks to divine intervention. I ought to begin by writing to my father and seeking a reconciliation; and if, for once, I would listen to his advice, he thought I ought to leave Paris and go back to the bosom of my family.","""Although I had never entertained a doubt of Tiberge's readiness to grant my request, yet I was surprised at having obtained it on such easy terms, that is to say, without a word of reprimand for my impenitence; but I was premature in fancying myself safe from his reproaches, for when he had counted out the money, and I was on the point of going away, he begged of me to take a walk with him in the garden.   I had not mentioned Manon's name; he knew nothing of her escape; so that his lecture was merely upon my own rash flight from St. Lazare, and upon his apprehensions lest, instead of profiting by the lessons of morality which I had received there, I should again relapse into dissipation. ""He told me, that having gone to pay me a visit at St. Lazare, the day after my escape, he had been astonished beyond expression at hearing the mode in which I had effected it; that he had afterwards a conversation with the Superior; that the good Father had not quite recovered the shock; that he had, however, the generosity to conceal the real circumstances from the lieutenant-general of police, and that he had prevented the death of the porter from becoming known outside the walls; that I had, therefore, upon that score, no ground for alarm, but that, if I retained one grain of prudence, I should profit by this happy turn which Providence had given to my affairs, and begin by writing to my father, and reconciling myself to his favour; and finally that, if I would be guided by his advice, I should at once quit Paris, and return to the bosom of my family."
"Elle continua de me raconter par quels moyens elle avait été instruite de mon séjour à Paris, du changement de ma condition, et de mes exercices de Sorbonne. Elle m’assura qu’elle avait été si agitée, pendant la dispute, qu’elle avait eu beaucoup de peine, non seulement à retenir ses larmes, mais ses gémissements mêmes et ses cris, qui avaient été plus d’une fois sur le point d’éclater. Enfin, elle me dit qu’elle était sortie de ce lieu la dernière, pour cacher son désordre, et que, ne suivant que le mouvement de son cœur et l’impétuosité de ses désirs, elle était venue droit au séminaire, avec la résolution d’y mourir si elle ne me trouvait pas disposé à lui pardonner.","She continued to tell me by what means she had learned of my stay in Paris, of the change in my condition, and of my exercises at the Sorbonne. She assured me that she had been so agitated during the argument that she had great difficulty, not only in restraining her tears, but her very moans and cries, which had more than once been on the point of bursting. Finally, she told me that she had left this place the last, to hide her disorder, and that, following only the movement of her heart and the impetuosity of her desires, she had come straight to the seminary, with the resolution to die there if she found me unwilling to forgive her.","She went on to tell me how she had found out that I was in Paris and about my change of condition and examination at the Sorbonne. I gathered that during my public disputation she had had the greatest difficulty in withholding not only her tears but even audible sobs and groans, so deeply had she been moved. She had stayed behind until last so that nobody should see her emotion, and then, acting on a sudden irresistible impulse, she had come straight to the seminary with a mind to die there if I refused to forgive her.","""She continued to inform me how she had been apprised of my residence at Paris, of the change in my condition, and of her witnessing my examination at the Sorbonne.   She told me how agitated she had been during my intellectual conflict with the examiner; what difficulty she felt in restraining her tears as well as her sighs, which were more than once on the point of spurning all control, and bursting forth; that she was the last person to leave the hall of examination, for fear of betraying her distress, and that, following only the instinct of her own heart, and her ardent desires, she came direct to the seminary, with the firm resolution of surrendering life itself, if she found me cruel enough to withhold my forgiveness."
"En lui promettant néanmoins un oubli général de ses fautes, je voulus être informé de quelle manière elle s’était laissé séduire par B...

Elle me parla de Tiberge et de la confusion extrême que sa visite lui avait causée.","Promising her, nevertheless, a general oblivion of her faults, I wished to be informed in what manner she had allowed herself to be seduced by B... She informed me that, having seen her at her window, he had become passionately fond of her; that he had made his declaration as a farmer-general, that is to say, by indicating to him in a letter that the payment would be proportionate to the favors; that she had capitulated at first, but with no other design than to draw from him some considerable sum which might serve to support us comfortably; that he had dazzled her with such magnificent promises, that she had allowed herself to be shaken by degrees; that I should, however, judge of her remorse by the grief of which she had let me see the testimonies, the day before our separation; that, despite the opulence in which he had kept her, she had never tasted happiness with him, not only because she did not find there, she told me, the delicacy of my feelings and the pleasing to my manners, but because even in the midst of the pleasures he unceasingly procured for her, she carried deep in her heart the memory of my love and remorse for her infidelity. She told me about Tiberge and the extreme confusion her visit had caused her.","And yet, although I promised to forgive and forget all her frailties, I felt I must know all about how she had been seduced by M. de B. I learned that he had seen her at the window, desired her passionately, and wooed her in true farmer-general style, that is to say by stating in a letter that payment would be in proportion to favours received. She had yielded first of all with no other object than to get out of him some large sum that would keep us both comfortably. Then he had held out in front of her such dazzling promises that she had given in little by little, and (she said) I could tell how bitterly she regretted doing so by the grief I had seen on her face just before our separation. In spite of the luxury with which he had surrounded her she had never tasted any real pleasure with him, not only because he had none of my delicacy and refinement of manner, but because, in the midst of all the amusements he constantly lavished on her, in her heart of hearts she had never ceased to have a haunting memory of my love and a growing sense of guilt for her unfaithfulness. She told me about Tiberge and how his visit had embarrassed her.","""In promising her, however, a full remission of her past frailties, I enquired how she permitted herself to be led astray by B----.   She informed me that having seen her at her window, he became passionately in love with her; that he made his advances in the true style of a mercantile cit;--that is to say, by giving her to understand in his letter, that his payments would be proportioned to her favours; that she had admitted his overtures at first with no other intention than that of getting from him such a sum as might enable us to live without inconvenience; but that he had so bewildered her with splendid promises, that she allowed herself to be misled by degrees.   She added, that I ought to have formed some notion of the remorse she experienced, by her grief on the night of our separation; and assured me that, in spite of the splendour in which he maintained her, she had never known a moment's happiness with him, not only, she said, because he was utterly devoid of that delicacy of sentiment and of those agreeable manners which I possessed, but because even in the midst of the amusements which he unceasingly procured her, she could never shake off the recollection of my love, or her own ingratitude.   She then spoke of Tiberge, and the extreme embarrassment his visit caused her.  "

Une si fâcheuse nouvelle ne pouvait manquer de l’alarmer beaucoup : il n’avait que ce fils, et sa vivacité était extrême pour son âge. Il voulut savoir d’abord du laquais tout ce que son fils avait fait l’après-midi, s’il s’était querellé avec quelqu’un, s’il avait pris part au démêlé d’un autre, s’il s’était trouvé dans quelque maison suspecte. Celui-ci, qui croyait son maître dans le dernier danger et qui s’imaginait ne devoir plus rien ménager pour lui procurer du secours, découvrit tout ce qu’il savait de son amour pour Manon et la dépense qu’il avait faite pour elle, la manière dont il avait passé l’après-midi dans sa maison jusqu’aux environs de neuf heures, sa sortie et le malheur de son retour. C’en fut assez pour faire soupçonner au vieillard que l’affaire de son fils était une querelle d’amour. Quoiqu’il fût au moins dix heures et demie du soir, il ne balança point à se rendre aussitôt chez M. le lieutenant de police. Il le pria de faire donner des ordres particuliers à toutes les escouades du guet, et lui en ayant demandé une pour se faire accompagner, il courut lui-même vers la rue où son fils avait été arrêté.

Naturally he was most alarmed at such disquieting news. He was extremely active for his age, and this was his only son. First he questioned the lackey about everything his son had done that afternoon – had he quarrelled with anybody, or taken part in somebody else’s quarrel? Had he been in any questionable house? The lackey, believing his master to be in deadly peril, thought that now he ought not to hold anything back that might help to save him, and divulged all he knew about his affair with Manon, the money he had laid out on her, how he had spent the afternoon in the house until about nine o’clock, how he had then gone out, and the trouble he had got into on his return.

I added; will not all my pretensions be fulfilled? It is certain that this project extremely flattered my inclinations. But, at the end of such a wise arrangement, I felt that my heart was still waiting for something, and that, to have nothing to desire in the most charming solitude, it was necessary to be there with Manon.","Along these lines I mapped out a plan for the peaceful and solitary life. The ingredients included a sequestered cottage with a little copse and a babbling brook at the end of the garden, a library of choice books, a select number of virtuous and intellectual friends and good but frugal and wholesome fare. I threw in a literary correspondence with a friend in Paris who kept me informed about the news – not so much to gratify my idle curiosity as to entertain me with the distant spectacle of the vain and feverish pursuits of men. ‘What bliss will be mine!’ I thought, ‘and will not all my ambitions be satisfied?’ These projects were calculated to flatter all my natural tendencies. But when all these sage deliberations were over, I felt that there was something still wanting, and that to make this peaceful retirement delightful beyond all possibility of improvement Manon would have to be there.","""I thereupon pictured to myself in anticipation a course of life peaceful and retired.   I fancied a retreat embosomed in a wood, with a limpid stream of running water bounding my garden; a library, comprising the most select works; a limited circle of friends, virtuous and intellectual; a table neatly served, but frugal and temperate.   To all these agremens I added a literary correspondence with a friend whose residence should be in Paris, who should give me occasional information upon public affairs, less for the gratification of my curiosity, than to afford a kind of relaxation by hearing of and lamenting the busy follies of men.   `Shall not I be happy?' added I; `will not my utmost wishes be thus gratified?'   This project flattered my inclinations extremely.   But after all the details of this most admirable and prudent plan, I felt that my heart still yearned for something; and that in order to leave nothing to desire in this most enchanting retirement, one ought to be able to share it with Manon."
"Il est sûr que, du naturel tendre et constant dont je suis, j’étais heureux pour toute ma vie, si Manon m’eût été fidèle. Plus je la connaissais, plus je découvrais en elle de nouvelles qualités aimables. Son esprit, son cœur, sa douceur et sa beauté formaient une chaîne si forte et si charmante, que j’aurais mis tout mon bonheur à n’en sortir jamais. Terrible changement ! Ce qui fait mon désespoir a pu faire ma félicité. Je me trouve le plus malheureux de tous les hommes, par cette même constance dont je devais attendre le plus doux de tous les sorts, et les plus parfaites récompenses de l’amour.","It is certain that, from the tender and constant nature of which I am, I would have been happy for all my life, if Manon had been faithful to me. The more I got to know her, the more I discovered new lovable qualities in her. Her mind, her heart, her gentleness and her beauty formed such a strong and charming chain that I would have taken all my happiness never to leave it. Terrible change! What makes my despair could make my happiness. I find myself the most unhappy of all men, by this same constancy from which I had to expect the sweetest of all fates, and the most perfect rewards of love.","I am quite sure that with my loyal and affectionate nature I should have been happy for life with Manon if only she had been faithful to me. The better I got to know her, the more charms of mind, heart, character and above all beauty I discovered in her, and her manifold and ever-fresh attractions bound me to her by ties so strong yet so delightful that I should have been content never to break them. What a terrible change of fortune was to be mine! Those very things which have brought me to despair might have made me rapturously happy, and I have become the most wretched man alive through that very constancy of mine which might have brought me the ineffable joys of true love.","It is certain that with my easy and constant disposition, I should have been happy for my whole life, if Manon had remained faithful to me.   The more I saw of her, the more I discovered in her new perfections.   Her mind, her heart, her gentleness and beauty, formed a chain at once so binding and so agreeable, that I could have found perfect happiness in its enduring influence.   Terrible fatality? that which has been the source of my despair, might, under a slight change of circumstances, have constituted my happiness.   I find myself the most wretched of mankind, by the force of that very constancy from which I might have fairly expected to derive the most serene of human blisses, and the most perfect recompense of love."
"Je consolais Manon, en avançant ; mais, au fond, j’avais le désespoir dans le cœur. Je me serais donné mille fois la mort, si je n’eusse pas eu, dans mes bras, le seul bien qui m’attachait à la vie. Cette seule pensée me remettait. Je la tiens du moins, dirais-je ; elle m’aime, elle est à moi. Tiberge a beau dire, ce n’est pas là un fantôme de bonheur. Je verrais périr tout l’univers sans y prendre intérêt. Pourquoi ? Parce que je n’ai plus d’affection de reste.","I consoled Manon as I advanced; but, deep down, I had despair in my heart. I would have killed myself a thousand times if I had not had, in my arms, the only good that attached me to life. That thought alone gave me back. I hold it at least, I would say; she loves me, she is mine. Tiberge may say so, this is not a phantom of happiness. I would see the whole universe perish without taking any interest in it. Why ? Because I have no affection left.","On the journey, for all my attempts to console Manon, I had death in my heart. Had I not had in my arms the only thing which bound me to this world, I would have taken my own life, and this consideration alone restored some calm to my mind. ‘I love her, she loves me, she is mine,’ I said to myself. ‘Tiberge can say what he likes. This is no empty shadow of happiness. I would see all the rest of the world perish and not care a rap. Why? Because I have no love left for anything else.’","""I tried to console Manon as we went along, but despair was rankling in my own heart.   I should have destroyed myself a thousand times over, if I had not felt that I held in my arms all that could attach me to life: this reflection reconciled me.   `I possess her at least,' said I; `she loves me! she is mine!   Vainly does Tiberge call this a mere phantom of happiness.'   I could, without feeling interest or emotion, see the whole world besides perish around me.   Why?   Because I have in it no object of affection beyond her."
"Le chevalier des Grieux ayant employé plus d’une heure à ce récit, je le priai de prendre un peu de relâche, et de nous tenir compagnie à souper. Notre attention lui fit juger que nous l’avions écouté avec plaisir. Il nous assura que nous trouverions quelque chose encore de plus intéressant dans la suite de son histoire, et lorsque nous eûmes fini de souper il continua dans ces termes.","The Chevalier des Grieux having spent more than an hour on this story, I begged him to take a little respite and keep us company at supper. Our attention made him judge that we had listened to him with pleasure. He assured us that we would find something even more interesting in the sequel of his story, and when we had finished supper he continued in these terms.","The Chevalier des Grieux had been speaking for over an hour, and I asked him to take a little rest and have some supper with us. He knew that we had enjoyed listening to him because our interest had never flagged, and he promised us that we should find something still more interesting in the sequel to his story. When supper was over he took up the tale again in these words.","We then took the road to Chaillot together, where I arrived much more easy in mind than when I had left it that morning."
"– Ah ! monsieur, repris-je, il me semble que votre rigueur est extrême, dans le traitement que vous avez fait à la malheureuse Manon. Vous vous en êtes rapporté à M. de G... M... Sa haine vous l’a représentée sous les plus noires couleurs. Vous vous êtes formé d’elle une affreuse idée. Cependant, c’est la plus douce et la plus aimable créature qui fût jamais. Que n’a-t-il plu au Ciel de vous inspirer l’envie de la voir un moment ! Je ne suis pas plus sûr qu’elle est charmante, que je le suis qu’elle vous l’aurait paru. Vous auriez pris parti pour elle ; vous auriez détesté les noirs artifices de G... M... ; vous auriez eu compassion d’elle et de moi. Hélas ! j’en suis sûr. Votre cœur n’est pas insensible ; vous vous seriez laissé attendrir.","– Ah! sir, I continued, it seems to me that your rigor is extreme in the treatment you gave to the unfortunate Manon. You referred it to M. de G... M... His hatred represented it to you in the darkest colors. You have formed a terrible idea of her. However, it is the sweetest and loveliest creature that ever was. Why did it not please Heaven to inspire you with the desire to see her for a while! I am no more sure that she is charming than I am than she would have seemed to you. You would have taken her side; you would have hated the black artifices of G... M...; you would have had compassion on her and on me. Alas! I'm sure. Your heart is not insensitive; you would have allowed yourself to be touched.","‘ Oh, Sir,’ I went on, ‘I feel that you are being unnecessarily severe in the treatment you have meted out to poor Manon. You have sought advice from M. de G. M., and in his hatred he has painted her in the blackest colours. You have formed a dreadful picture of her, and yet she really is the sweetest and most lovable creature that ever lived. Why has not Heaven inspired you to want to see her just for a moment? I am no more certain that she is charming than that you would have found her so. You would have taken her part. You would have come to loathe the shady intrigues of G. M. and would have taken pity on her and me. Yes, I know you would. Your heart is not made of stone, and it would have been softened.’","""`Ah, sir,' I replied, `it does seem to me that your severity is excessive in the penalty you inflict upon the unfortunate Manon.   You have taken only M. G---- M----'s report of her.   His hatred has made him represent her to you in the most odious colours: you have formed a frightful idea of her.   She is, on the contrary, the mildest and most amiable of living creatures; would that Heaven had but inspired you at any one moment with the desire of seeing her!   I am convinced that you would be not less sensible of her perfections than your unhappy son.   You would then have been her advocate; you would have abhorred the foul artifices of G---- M----; you would have had pity on both her and me.   Alas! I am persuaded of it; your heart is not insensible; it must ere now have melted with compassion.'"

"– Pour le lieu, ajouta-t-il agréablement, il ne faut plus l’appeler l’Hôpital ; c’est Versailles, depuis qu’une personne qui mérite l’empire de tous les cœurs y est renfermée.","“As for the place,” he added pleasantly, “we must no longer call it the Hospital; it is Versailles, since a person who deserves the empire of all hearts has been confined there.","And as to this place,’ he added with a smile, ‘we must not call it the Hôpital any more. Since a person worthy to reign over all hearts has been kept here, it is Versailles!’","`As to the abode,' he said, 'it must no longer be called the Magdalen; it is Versailles! now that it contains a person who deserves the empire of all hearts.'"
"– Ô mon Père, lui dis-je, en continuant de pleurer comme un enfant, figurez-vous la plus horrible cruauté, imaginez-vous la plus détestable de toutes les barbaries, c’est l’action que l’indigne G...

You are good, you will have pity on me.","Oh, Father,’ I said, still weeping like a child, ‘think of the most loathsome cruelty, the most inhuman savagery you can imagine, and that may give you some inkling of what this unspeakable G. M. has done. He has dealt me a blow from which I shall never recover. I should like to tell you the whole story. You are kind and you will have pity on me.’","said I to him, continuing to cry like a child, `imagine the most horrible cruelty, figure to yourself the most inhuman of atrocities --that is what G---- M---- has had the cowardly baseness to perpetrate: he has pierced my heart.

"Après avoir soupé avec plus de satisfaction que je n’en avais jamais ressenti, je me retirai pour exécuter notre projet. Mes arrangements furent d’autant plus faciles, qu’ayant eu dessein de retourner le lendemain chez mon père, mon petit équipage était déjà préparé. Je n’eus donc nulle peine à faire transporter ma malle, et à faire tenir une chaise prête pour cinq heures du matin, qui étaient le temps où les portes de la ville devaient être ouvertes ; mais je trouvai un obstacle dont je ne me défiais point, et qui faillit de rompre entièrement mon dessein.","After having supped with more satisfaction than I had ever felt, I retired to carry out our project. My arrangements were all the easier because, having intended to return the next day to my father, my little crew was already prepared. I therefore had no difficulty in having my trunk transported, and in having a chair ready for five o'clock in the morning, which was the time when the gates of the city were to be opened; but I found an obstacle which I did not distrust, and which almost completely broke my plan.","After the most delightful meal I had ever enjoyed, I went off to put the scheme into operation. Arrangements were all the easier because my things were ready packed for my return home next day.

"Je regardai comme un effet de la protection du Ciel de m’être souvenu si à propos de Tiberge et je résolus de chercher les moyens de le voir avant la fin du jour. Je retournai sur-le-champ au logis, pour lui écrire un mot, et lui marquer un lieu propre à notre entretien. Je lui recommandais le silence et la discrétion, comme un des plus importants services qu’il pût me rendre dans la situation de mes affaires. La joie que l’espérance de le voir m’inspirait effaça les traces du chagrin que Manon n’aurait pas manqué d’apercevoir sur mon visage. Je lui parlai de notre malheur de Chaillot comme d’une bagatelle qui ne devait pas l’alarmer ; et Paris étant le lieu du monde où elle se voyait avec le plus de plaisir, elle ne fut pas fâchée de m’entendre dire qu’il était à propos d’y demeurer jusqu’à ce qu’on eût réparé à Chaillot quelques légers effets de l’incendie. Une heure après, je reçus la réponse de Tiberge, qui me promettait de se rendre au lieu de l’assignation. J’y courus avec impatience. Je sentais néanmoins quelque honte d’aller paraître aux yeux d’un ami, dont la seule présence devait être un reproche de mes désordres, mais l’opinion que j’avais de la bonté de son cœur et l’intérêt de Manon soutinrent ma hardiesse.","I considered it an effect of Heaven's protection to have remembered so apropos of Tiberge, and resolved to seek means of seeing him before the close of day. I returned at once to the house, to write him a note, and mark out to him a suitable place for our interview. I recommended silence and discretion to him, as one of the most important services he could render me in the situation of my affairs. The joy that the hope of seeing him inspired in me erased the traces of grief that Manon would not have failed to see on my face. I spoke to him of our misfortune at Chaillot as of a trifle which should not alarm him; and Paris being the place in the world where she saw herself with the greatest pleasure, she was not sorry to hear me say that it was proper to stay there until some light things had been repaired at Chaillot. effects of the fire. An hour later, I received Tiberge's reply, who promised to go to the place of summons. I ran there impatiently. I nevertheless felt some shame at going to appear in the eyes of a friend, whose mere presence was to be a reproach for my disorders, but the opinion I had of the goodness of his heart and Manon's interest sustained my boldness.","I interpreted this timely recollection of Tiberge as a sign of heavenly intervention, and I resolved to find a way of seeing him that very day. I went straight back home and wrote him a note suggesting a suitable meeting-place and enjoining absolute secrecy as the most important thing he could do for me in my present circumstances. Fortunately my joy at the prospect of seeing him again smoothed away from my face the traces of worry Manon could not have failed to notice. I referred to our Chaillot mishap as a mere bagatelle not to be taken at all seriously, and, as she enjoyed being in Paris better than anywhere else in the world, she was not sorry to hear me say that we had better stay there until the slight damage caused at Chaillot by the fire had been put right. An hour later I had word from Tiberge promising to keep the appointment. Although I felt a little ashamed at showing myself to a friend whose very presence was a reproach to my excesses, I went there with all speed, keeping my courage up by my knowledge of his kindness of heart and my concern for Manon’s interests.","""I consider it a blessing to have thought so apropos of Tiberge, and resolved to take measures to find him before evening.   I returned at once to my lodgings to write him a line, and fix a convenient place for our meeting.   I requested secrecy and discretion, as the most important service he could render me under present circumstances. ""The pleasure I derived from the prospect of seeing Tiberge dissipated every trace of melancholy, which Manon would not have failed otherwise to detect in my countenance.   I described our misfortune at Chaillot as a trifle which ought not to annoy her; and Paris being the spot she liked best in the world, she was not sorry to hear me say that it would be necessary for us to remain there entirely, until the little damage was repaired which had been caused by the fire at Chaillot. ""In an hour I received an answer from Tiberge, who promised to be at the appointed rendezvous.   I went there punctually.   I certainly felt some shame at encountering a friend whose presence alone ought to be a reproach to my iniquities; but I was supported by the opinion I had of the goodness of his heart, as well as by my anxiety about Manon."

"Nous cultivâmes soigneusement l’amitié du gouverneur. Il eut la bonté, quelques semaines après notre arrivée, de me donner un petit emploi qui vint à vaquer dans le fort. Quoiqu’il ne fût pas bien distingué, je l’acceptai comme une faveur du Ciel. Il me mettait en état de vivre sans être à charge à personne. Je pris un valet pour moi et une servante pour Manon. Notre petite fortune s’arrangea. J’étais réglé dans ma conduite ; Manon ne l’était pas moins. Nous ne laissions point échapper l’occasion de rendre service et de faire du bien à nos voisins. Cette disposition officieuse et la douceur de nos manières nous attirèrent la confiance et l’affection de toute la colonie. Nous fûmes en peu de temps si considérés, que nous passions pour les premières personnes de la ville après le gouverneur.","We carefully cultivated the governor's friendship. He had the kindness, a few weeks after our arrival, to give me a little job which became vacant in the fort. Although he was not well distinguished, I accepted him as a favor from Heaven.

I was regulated in my conduct; Manon was no less. We did not miss the opportunity to render service and do good to our neighbours.

A few weeks after our arrival, he was good enough to give me a small post which happened to fall vacant at the citadel. It was not a very distinguished position, but I accepted it as a boon from Heaven, for it enabled me to live without depending on anybody else. I took a man for myself and a maid for Manon. Our little fortune settled into a routine. My life was exemplary and so was Manon’s, and we neglected no opportunity of making ourselves useful or of doing good to our neighbours. Our sociable disposition and the gentleness of our manners earned us the confidence and affection of the whole community. In a short while we were so well thought of that we ranked as the leading people in the town after the governor.","""We carefully cultivated the governor's friendship.   He bestowed upon me, a few weeks after our arrival, a small appointment which became vacant in the fort.

Our little establishment became settled: nothing could surpass the regularity of my conduct, or that of Manon; we lost no opportunity of serving or doing an act of kindness to our neighbours.

We soon became so respected, that we ranked as the principal persons in the town after the governor."
"Il me laissa seul, après mille protestations d’amitié. J’employai la nuit à mettre ordre à mes affaires, et m’étant rendu à l’hôtellerie de mademoiselle Manon vers la pointe du jour, je la trouvai qui m’attendait.

"– Les reconnaissez-vous ? lui dit-il avec un sourire moqueur. Ce n’était pas la première fois que vous les eussiez vus. Les mêmes, sur ma foi.

"Elle ne me répondit que par quelques soupirs qui augmentèrent mon inquiétude. Je me levai en tremblant. Je la conjurai, avec tous les empressements de l’amour, de me découvrir le sujet de ses pleurs ; j’en versai moi-même en essuyant les siens ; j’étais plus mort que vif.

"Quoiqu’à mes propres yeux cette action fût une véritable friponnerie, ce n’était pas la plus injuste que je crusse avoir à me reprocher.

I am not sure whether he took any steps that night to discover us, but he had influence enough to ensure an effectual pursuit, and we were sufficiently imprudent to rely upon the extent of Paris and the distance between our residence and his.   Not only did he discover our abode and our circumstances, but also who I was--the life that I had led in Paris--Manon's former connection with B----,--the manner in which she had deceived him: in a word, all the scandalous facts of our history.   He therefore resolved to have us apprehended, and treated less as criminals than as vagabonds.  "

"« Tiberge, disais-je, le bon Tiberge, me refusera-t-il ce qu’il aura le pouvoir de me donner ? Non, il sera touché de ma misère ; mais il m’assassinera par sa morale. Il faudra essuyer ses reproches, ses exhortations, ses menaces ; il me fera acheter ses secours si cher, que je donnerais encore une partie de mon sang plutôt que de m’exposer à cette scène fâcheuse qui me laissera du trouble et des remords. Bon ! reprenais-je, il faut donc renoncer à tout espoir puisqu’il ne me reste point d’autre voie, et que je suis si éloigné de m’arrêter à ces deux-là, que je verserais plus volontiers la moitié de mon sang que d’en prendre une, c’est-à-dire tout mon sang plutôt que de les prendre toutes deux ? Oui, mon sang tout entier, ajoutai-je, après une réflexion d’un moment ; je le donnerais plus volontiers, sans doute, que de me réduire à de basses supplications. Mais il s’agit bien ici de mon sang ! Il s’agit de la vie et de l’entretien de Manon, il s’agit de son amour et de sa fidélité. Qu’ai-je à mettre en balance avec elle ? Je n’y ai rien mis jusqu’à présent. Elle me tient lieu de gloire, de bonheur et de fortune. Il y a bien des choses, sans doute, que je donnerais ma vie pour obtenir ou pour éviter mais estimer une chose plus que ma vie n’est pas une raison pour l’estimer autant que Manon. »","""Tiberge,"" I said, ""will the good Tiberge refuse me what he has the power to give me? No, he will be touched by my misery; but he will assassinate me by his morality. It will be necessary to wipe his reproaches, his exhortations, his threats; he will make me buy his assistance so dearly that I would give a part of my blood rather than expose myself to this unfortunate scene which will leave me troubled and remorseful. Good ! I went on, ""we must therefore give up all hope since I have no other way left, and I am so far from stopping at these two that I would more willingly shed half my blood than to take one, that is, all my blood, rather than taking them both? Yes, my whole blood, I added, after a moment's reflection; I would give it more willingly, no doubt, than reduce myself to low entreaties. But this is definitely my blood! It is about the life and maintenance of Manon, it is about her love and her fidelity. What do I have to weigh against it? I haven't put anything in it so far. It takes the place of glory, happiness and fortune for me. There are many things, no doubt, that I would give my life to obtain or to avoid, but to value something more than my life is not a reason to value it as much as Manon. »","‘Then there is Tiberge,’ I thought. ‘Surely my good Tiberge will not refuse anything he can give me? No, my plight will touch his heart, but his moral sermons will be the death of me. I shall have to swallow his reproaches, exhortations and threats; he will exact such a price for his help that there again I would give part of my blood rather than have to face a tiresome scene which will leave me all upset and plagued with remorse. Very well, then, I shall have to give up all hope, since there is no alternative left and I am so averse from stopping to consider these, that I would rather shed half my blood than have recourse to either – that is to say the whole of my blood rather than try both. Yes, the whole of my blood,’ I reflected; ‘I would cheerfully shed it all rather than stoop to grovelling supplications. ‘But what has my blood got to do with it? What matters is Manon’s life and how to keep her alive; all that matters is her love, her loyalty. Have I anything worthy to be weighed in the balance against her? Such a thought has never occurred to me until now. For me she is glory, happiness and fortune. No doubt there are many things I would give my life to have or to avoid, but to value a thing higher than my life is no reason for valuing it as high as Manon.’","""`Tiberge,' said I, `kind Tiberge, will he refuse me what he has it in his power to grant?   No, he will assuredly sympathise in my misery; but he will also torture me with his lectures!   One must endure his reproaches, his exhortations, his threats: I shall have to purchase his assistance so dearly, that I would rather make any sacrifice than encounter this distressing scene, which cannot fail to leave me full of sorrow and remorse.   Well,' thought I again, `all hope must be relinquished, since no other course presents itself: so far am I from adopting either of these, that I would sooner shed half my blood than face one of these evils, or the last drop rather than encounter both.   Yes, the very last drop,' I repeated after a moment's reflection, `I would sacrifice willingly rather than submit to such base supplication! ""`But it is not in reality a question of my existence!   Manon's life and maintenance, her love and her fidelity, are at stake!   What consideration can outweigh that?   In her are centred all my glory, happiness, and future fortune!   There are doubtless many things that I would gladly give up my life to obtain, or to avoid; but to estimate a thing merely beyond the value of my own life, is not putting it on a par with that of Manon.'

"Je revenais un jour de Rouen, où elle m’avait prié d’aller solliciter une affaire au Parlement de Normandie pour la succession de quelques terres auxquelles je lui avais laissé des prétentions du côté de mon grand-père maternel. Ayant repris mon chemin par Évreux, où je couchai la première nuit, j’arrivai le lendemain pour dîner à Pacy, qui en est éloigné de cinq ou six lieues. Je fus surpris, en entrant dans ce bourg, d’y voir tous les habitants en alarme. Ils se précipitaient de leurs maisons pour courir en foule à la porte d’une mauvaise hôtellerie, devant laquelle étaient deux chariots couverts. Les chevaux, qui étaient encore attelés et qui paraissaient fumants de fatigue et de chaleur marquaient que ces deux voitures ne faisaient qu’arriver. Je m’arrêtai un moment pour m’informer d’où venait le tumulte ; mais je tirai peu d’éclaircissement d’une populace curieuse, qui ne faisait nulle attention à mes demandes, et qui s’avançait toujours vers l’hôtellerie, en se poussant avec beaucoup de confusion. Enfin, un archer revêtu d’une bandoulière, et le mousquet sur l’épaule, ayant paru à la porte, je lui fis signe de la main de venir à moi. Je le priai de m’apprendre le sujet de ce désordre.","I was returning one day from Rouen, where she had asked me to go and solicit a case from the Parliament of Normandy for the succession of some lands to which I had left her claims on the side of my maternal grandfather. Having resumed my journey via Évreux, where I slept the first night, I arrived the next day to dine at Pacy, which is five or six leagues distant. I was surprised, on entering this town, to see all the inhabitants in alarm. They rushed from their houses to run in crowds to the door of a poor inn, in front of which were two covered wagons. The horses, which were still harnessed and which seemed steaming with fatigue and heat, showed that these two carriages had only just arrived. I stopped a moment to inquire where the tumult was coming from; but I elicited little information from a curious populace, who paid no attention to my requests, and who continued to advance towards the hostelry, pushing each other in great confusion. Finally, an archer wearing a bandolier, and the musket on his shoulder, having appeared at the door, I made a sign to him with my hand to come to me. I begged him to tell me the subject of this disorder.","I once had to go to Rouen where she had asked me to see a case through the Law Courts relating to some land left by my maternal grandfather which I wished to hand over to her.

As I came into the little town I was surprised to see all the people rushing out of their houses and gathering in a crowd outside a shabby-looking inn in front of which two covered wagons were standing. The two wagons had evidently only just arrived, for the horses were still panting and steaming in the shafts. I stopped a moment to find out the cause of the uproar, but I could get no sense out of the gaping crowd, who ignored my questions and kept on fighting their way towards the inn. But just then there appeared in the doorway a soldier, complete with bandolier and musket, and I beckoned him and asked him what all the excitement was about. ‘","I was one day returning from Rouen, where I had been, at her request, to attend a cause then pending before the Parliament of Normandy, respecting an inheritance to which I had claims derived from my maternal grandfather.

I was amazed, on entering this quiet town, to see all the inhabitants in commotion.

"Sa résolution me fut beaucoup plus agréable que l’espérance des cinq mille livres. J’eus lieu de reconnaître que mon cœur n’avait point encore perdu tout sentiment d’honneur puisqu’il était si satisfait d’échapper à l’infamie. Mais j’étais né pour les courtes joies et les longues douleurs. La Fortune ne me délivrera d’un précipice que pour me faire tomber dans un autre. Lorsque j’eus marqué à Manon, par mille caresses, combien je me croyais heureux de son changement, je lui dis qu’il fallait en instruire M. Lescaut, afin que nos mesures se prissent de concert. Il en murmura d’abord ; mais les quatre ou cinq mille livres d’argent comptant le firent entrer gaiement dans nos vues. Il fut donc réglé que nous nous trouverions tous à souper avec M. de G... M..., et cela pour deux raisons : l’une, pour nous donner le plaisir d’une scène agréable en me faisant passer pour un écolier, frère de Manon ; l’autre, pour empêcher ce vieux libertin de s’émanciper trop avec ma maîtresse, par le droit qu’il croirait s’être acquis en payant si libéralement d’avance. Nous devions nous retirer, Lescaut et moi, lorsqu’il monterait à la chambre où il comptait de passer la nuit ; et Manon, au lieu de le suivre, nous promit de sortir et de la venir passer avec moi. Lescaut se chargea du soin d’avoir exactement un carrosse à la porte.","His resolution was much more agreeable to me than the expectation of five thousand pounds. I had reason to recognize that my heart had not yet lost all feeling of honor since it was so satisfied to escape infamy. But I was born for short joys and long sorrows. Fortune will deliver me from one precipice only to make me fall into another. When I had expressed to Manon, by a thousand caresses, how happy I thought I was at her change, I told her that we must inform M. Lescaut about it, so that our measures could be taken in concert. He murmured at first; but the four or five thousand pounds in cash brought him cheerfully into our sights. It was therefore settled that we should all be at supper with M. de G... M..., and that for two reasons: one, to give us the pleasure of a pleasant scene by making me pass for a schoolboy, brother of Manon; the other, to prevent this old libertine from emancipating himself too much with my mistress, by the right he thought he had acquired by paying so liberally in advance. We were to retire, Lescaut and I, when he went up to the room where he intended to spend the night; and Manon, instead of following him, promised to go out and come and spend her with me. Lescaut undertook to have exactly one carriage at the door.","This decision of hers pleased me much more than the prospect of the five thousand livres. I had not yet lost every honourable feeling, it seemed to me, since I was so glad to be spared this infamy. But I was born to fleeting joys and lasting sufferings. Fate rescued me from one abyss only to hurl me down into another. I showed my gratitude for this change of plan by embracing Manon passionately, and then said that we must inform M. Lescaut so that the three of us could act together. He demurred at first, but the four or five thousand in hard cash brought him cheerfully round to our point of view. It was settled that we should all be present at supper with M. de G. M., and for two reasons: firstly for the fun of the comic turn I was to put on as Manon’s student brother, and secondly to prevent the old rake from making too free with his mistress on the strength of having paid liberally in advance. It was arranged that Lescaut and I would take our leave when he went up to the room where he proposed to spend the night, and instead of following him Manon promised to come out and spend it with me. Lescaut undertook to have a carriage waiting at the proper moment outside the door.","""Her determination was of more value in my eyes than twenty thousand crowns.   I could feel that I was not yet bereft of every sentiment of honour, by the satisfaction I experienced at escaping thus from infamy,   But I was born for brief joys, and miseries of long duration.   Fate never rescued me from one precipice, but to lead me to another.   When I had expressed my delight to Manon at this change in her intentions, I told her she had better inform Lescaut of it, in order that we might take our measures in concert.   At first he murmured, but the money in hand induced him to enter into our views.   It was then determined that we should all meet at G---- M----'s supper table, and that, for two reasons: first, for the amusement of passing me off as a schoolboy, and brother to Manon; and secondly, to prevent the old profligate from taking any liberties with his mistress, on the strength of his liberal payments in advance.   Lescaut and I were to retire, when he went to the room where he expected to pass the night; and Manon, instead of following him, promised to come out, and join us.

Il ajouta qu’il me croyait entièrement dégagé de Manon, mais qu’il était surpris, néanmoins, que je ne lui eusse pas donné de mes nouvelles depuis huit jours. Mon père n’était pas dupe ; il comprit qu’il y avait quelque chose qui échappait à la pénétration de Tiberge, dans le silence dont il se plaignait, et il employa tant de soins pour découvrir mes traces que, deux jours après son arrivée, il apprit que j’étais au Châtelet.","He had made up his mind to come and assure himself of my change through his eyes, and to regulate his conduct by the sincerity of my repentance.

Tiberge gave him a very reassuring account of my leanings towards virtue as expressed in our last talk, adding that he thought I had broken altogether with Manon, but he was surprised that I had not given him any news of myself for a week.

"Je lui demandai s’il n’était point à craindre qu’elle ne fût reconnue en traversant les galeries et les cours.

He agreed that she could absolutely escape in this way; “but if she is recognized,” he continued, “if she is arrested while fleeing, it may be the end of her forever. Besides, you would therefore have to leave Paris immediately, because you would never be sufficiently hidden from the searches. They would be doubled, as much in relation to you as to her. A man escapes easily when he is alone, but it is almost impossible to remain unknown with a pretty woman. »","I asked whether there was any fear of her being recognized in the passages and courtyards. He admitted that there was some danger of that, but said that there were some risks that had to be taken. His keenness delighted me, but I called in M. de T. to lay the project before him, together with the only drawback which might make it unsafe. He saw more difficulties than I had. He agreed that it was quite possible that she might get away by such means, but he pointed out that if she were recognized and stopped while attempting to escape it might be all up with her for good. ‘ Moreover,’ he went on, ‘you would have to leave Paris at once, for you would never be sufficiently hidden from a search. The search would be intensified for you as well as for her, and while one man alone can easily dodge his pursuers, it is next to impossible to remain unobserved in the company of a pretty woman.’","I asked whether there was no danger of her being recognised as she traversed the long galleries and the courts.   He admitted that there was danger, but that nothing could be done without some slight risk. ""Although I was delighted to find him so determined, I called M. de T----, and informed him of the project, and of the only difficulty in the way.   He thought it not so easy of execution.   He allowed the possibility of escaping thus:  `But if she be recognised,' continued he, `if she be stopped in the attempt, all hope will be over with her, perhaps for ever.   Besides, you would be obliged to quit Paris instantly, for you could never evade the search that would be made for you: they would redouble their efforts as much on your own account as hers.

Little did I care if I could be sure of the bliss of living with her. Is not the whole universe the dwelling-place of two faithful lovers?

"Cet arrangement n’eût pas été la plus folle action de ma vie, si nous eussions été assez sages pour nous y assujettir constamment. Mais nos résolutions ne durèrent guère plus d’un mois. Manon était passionnée pour le plaisir ; je l’étais pour elle. Il nous naissait, à tous moments, de nouvelles occasions de dépense ; et loin de regretter les sommes qu’elle employait quelquefois avec profusion, je fus le premier à lui procurer tout ce que je croyais propre à lui plaire. Notre demeure de Chaillot commença même à lui devenir à charge. L’hiver approchait ; tout le monde retournait à la ville, et la campagne devenait déserte. Elle me proposa de reprendre une maison à Paris. Je n’y consentis point ; mais, pour la satisfaire en quelque chose, je lui dis que nous pouvions y louer un appartement meublé, et que nous y passerions la nuit lorsqu’il nous arriverait de quitter trop tard l’assemblée où nous allions plusieurs fois la semaine, car l’incommodité de revenir si tard à Chaillot était le prétexte qu’elle apportait pour le vouloir quitter. Nous nous donnâmes ainsi deux logements, l’un à la ville, et l’autre à la campagne. Ce changement mit bientôt le dernier désordre dans nos affaires, en faisant naître deux aventures qui causèrent notre ruine.","This arrangement would not have been the craziest action of my life, if we had been wise enough to subject ourselves to it constantly. But our resolutions hardly lasted more than a month. Manon was passionate about pleasure; I was for her. New occasions for spending arose at all times; and far from regretting the sums which she sometimes used profusely, I was the first to procure for her all that I thought fit to please her. Our home at Chaillot even began to become a burden to him. Winter was approaching; everyone returned to the city, and the countryside became deserted. She suggested that I take over a house in Paris. I did not consent to it; but, to satisfy her in some way, I told her that we could rent a furnished apartment there, and that we would spend the night there when we happened to leave the assembly too late, where we went several times a week, because the The inconvenience of returning to Chaillot so late was the pretext she brought for wanting to leave it. We thus gave ourselves two lodgings, one in the city, and the other in the country. This change soon put the last disorder in our affairs, by giving birth to two adventures which caused our ruin.","If only we had had the wisdom to keep to it closely, this arrangement would certainly not have been the silliest one I had made in my life. But our resolutions lasted little more than a month. Manon was pleasure-mad and I was mad on her. Some new reason for spending money arose at every moment, and far from regretting the sums she squandered I was the first to buy her anything she fancied. Even our home at Chaillot began to get on her nerves, for with the approach of winter everybody went back to town and the country was deserted. She suggested taking a house in Paris again. I did not agree, but in order to give her some satisfaction I said that we might take furnished rooms there. It would be somewhere to spend the night when we stayed late at the assembly-rooms where we went several evenings a week – her pretext for wanting to leave Chaillot was the difficulty of getting home late at night. So now we had two homes, one in town and the other in the country, and this change promptly led to the final breakdown of our affairs, because it was directly responsible for two adventures which brought disaster.","""This arrangement would not have been by any means the most silly act of my life, if we had only been prudent enough to persevere in its execution; but our resolutions hardly lasted longer than a month.   Manon's passion was for amusement; she was the only object of mine.   New temptations to expense constantly presented themselves, and far from regretting the money which she sometimes prodigally lavished, I was the first to procure for her everything likely to afford her pleasure.   Our residence at Chaillot began even to appear tiresome. ""Winter was approaching, and the whole world returning to town; the country had a deserted look.   She proposed to me to take a house in Paris.   I did not approve of this; but, in order partly at least to satisfy her, I said that we might hire furnished apartments, and that we might sleep there whenever we were late in quitting the assembly , whither we often went; for the inconvenience of returning so late to Chaillot was her excuse for wishing to leave it.   We had thus two dwellings, one in town and the other in the country.   This change soon threw our affairs into confusion, and led to two adventures, which eventually caused our ruin."

"– Mon cher chevalier me dit-il, je ne vous dis rien qui ne soit solidement vrai, et dont je ne me sois convaincu par un sérieux examen.

J’ai conçu pour le monde un mépris auquel il n’y a rien d’égal. Devineriez-vous ce qui m’y retient, ajouta-t-il, et ce qui m’empêche de courir à la solitude ? C’est uniquement la tendre amitié que j’ai pour vous. Je connais l’excellence de votre cœur et de votre esprit ; il n’y a rien de bon dont vous ne puissiez vous rendre capable. Le poison du plaisir vous a fait écarter du chemin. Quelle perte pour la vertu ! Votre fuite d’Amiens m’a causé tant de douleur, que je n’ai pas goûté, depuis, un seul moment de satisfaction.

Judge by the steps she made me take.","My dear fellow, I am saying nothing that is not founded on solid truth, and I have only reached this conviction after long and careful thought. There was a time when I was as much given to sensual gratification as you are, but God also gave me a love of virtue. I used my intelligence and compared the fruits of sin with those of virtue, and, God helping me, I soon found out the difference. The world has no charms for me now. Can you guess what has kept me in the world and prevented me from seeking the peace of the solitary life? Simply my friendship for you. I know your qualities of heart and mind and that there is no good thing you are not capable of. The lust of the flesh has led you astray, and what a loss it has been for the forces of good! Your flight from Amiens was such a grievous shock to me that I have not had a moment’s happiness since. You can tell the truth of that by all the things I have felt impelled to do. Listen.’",""" `My dear chevalier,' said he to me, `you shall hear nothing but the strict truth, of which I have assured myself by the most serious examination.   I had, perhaps, as strong an inclination for pleasure as you, but Heaven had at the same time, in its mercy, blessed me with a taste for virtue.   I exercised my reason in comparing the consequences of the one with those of the other, and the divine aid was graciously vouchsafed to my reflections.   I conceived for the world a contempt which nothing can equal.   Can you guess what it is retains me in it now,' he added, `and that prevents me from embracing a life of solitude?

M... who left this house very unsatisfied, and who is respected enough to be feared.","Seeing me in such depths of affliction, the worthy priest tried to console me, saying that he had never known the true facts of my story as I had just put them. He had known, of course, about my disorderly life, but he had supposed that the motives behind M. de G. M. ’s action had been concern for me and family friendship. That was the only interpretation he had been able to find, and what I had just told him put a very different complexion on the affair. He felt sure that the true account he now intended giving to the Lieutenant-General of Police would hasten the day when I should be set free. He then asked me why I had not yet thought of letting my family know what had become of me; since they were not responsible for my captivity. I met this objection with reasons drawn from the grief I had been afraid of inflicting on my father, and the shame I should have felt myself. He finally promised to go at once to the Lieutenant-General if only to forestall some still more sinister move on the part of M. de G. M., who had gone off in an ugly mood and who was influential enough to be dangerous.","""The good Father, seeing me in such affliction, endeavoured to console me.   He told me that he had never understood my history, as I just now related it ; he had of course known that I led a dissolute life, but he had imagined that M. G---- M----'s interest about me was the result of his esteem and friendship for my family; that it was in this sense he had explained the matter to him; that what I had now told him should assuredly produce a change in my treatment, and that he had no doubt but the accurate detail which he should immediately transmit to the lieutenant-general of police would bring about my liberation. ""He then enquired why I had never thought of informing my family of what had taken place, since they had not been instrumental to my incarceration.   I satisfactorily answered this by stating my unwillingness to cause my father pain, or to bring upon myself the humiliation of such an exposure.   In the end, he promised to go directly to the lieutenant-general of police if it were only, said he, to be beforehand with M. G---- M----, who went off in such a rage, and who had sufficient influence to make himself formidable."

"Je cédai à ses instances, malgré les mouvements secrets de mon cœur qui semblaient me présager une catastrophe malheureuse.

Je demeurai avec eux jusqu’au moment où je vis paraître G... M..., et je me retirai alors quelques pas au-dessous, dans un endroit obscur pour être témoin d’une scène si extraordinaire.

"Manon était une créature d’un caractère extraordinaire. Jamais fille n’eut moins d’attachement qu’elle pour l’argent, mais elle ne pouvait être tranquille un moment, avec la crainte d’en manquer. C’était du plaisir et des passe-temps qu’il lui fallait. Elle n’eût jamais voulu toucher un sou, si l’on pouvait se divertir sans qu’il en coûte. Elle ne s’informait pas même quel était le fonds de nos richesses, pourvu qu’elle pût passer agréablement la journée, de sorte que, n’étant ni excessivement livrée au jeu ni capable d’être éblouie par le faste des grandes dépenses, rien n’était plus facile que de la satisfaire, en lui faisant naître tous les jours des amusements de son goût. Mais c’était une chose si nécessaire pour elle, d’être ainsi occupée par le plaisir qu’il n’y avait pas le moindre fond à faire, sans cela, sur son humeur et sur ses inclinations. Quoiqu’elle m’aimât tendrement, et que je fusse le seul, comme elle en convenait volontiers, qui pût lui faire goûter parfaitement les douceurs de l’amour, j’étais presque certain que sa tendresse ne tiendrait point contre de certaines craintes. Elle m’aurait préféré à toute la terre avec une fortune médiocre ; mais je ne doutais nullement qu’elle ne m’abandonnât pour quelque nouveau B... lorsqu’il ne me resterait que de la constance et de la fidélité à lui offrir. Je résolus donc de régler si bien ma dépense particulière que je fusse toujours en état de fournir aux siennes, et de me priver plutôt de mille choses nécessaires que de la borner même pour le superflu. Le carrosse m’effrayait plus que tout le reste ; car il n’y avait point d’apparence de pouvoir entretenir des chevaux et un cocher. Je découvris ma peine à M. Lescaut. Je ne lui avais point caché que j’eusse reçu cent pistoles d’un ami. Il me répéta que, si je voulais tenter le hasard du jeu, il ne désespérait point qu’en sacrifiant de bonne grâce une centaine de francs pour traiter ses associés, je ne pusse être admis, à sa recommandation, dans la Ligue de l’Industrie. Quelque répugnance que j’eusse à tromper, je me laissai entraîner par une cruelle nécessité.","Manon was a creature of extraordinary character. Never had a girl been less fond of money than she was, but she could not be quiet for a moment, fearing she would run out of it. It was fun and hobbies that he needed. She would never have wanted to get a penny, if one could amuse oneself without cost. She did not even inquire what was the fund of our wealth, provided she could pass the day pleasantly, so that, being neither excessively given up to gambling nor capable of being dazzled by the pomp of great expenditure, nothing was easier than to satisfy her, by giving her every day amusements to her liking. But it was such a necessary thing for her, to be so occupied with pleasure that there was not the least ground to be made, without it, on her mood and her inclinations. Although she loved me tenderly, and I was the only one, as she willingly admitted, who could make her taste perfectly the sweetness of love, I was almost certain that her tenderness would not hold against certain fears. She would have preferred me to all the earth with mediocre fortune; but I had no doubt that she would abandon me for some new B... when I had nothing left but constancy and fidelity to offer her. I therefore resolved to regulate my private expense so well that I would always be able to provide for his, and rather to deprive myself of a thousand necessities than to limit it even to the superfluous. The carriage frightened me more than anything else; for there was no prospect of being able to maintain horses and a coachman. I revealed my grief to M. Lescaut. I had not concealed from him that I had received a hundred pistoles from a friend. He repeated to me that, if I wanted to try the chance of the game, he did not despair that by willingly sacrificing a hundred francs to treat his associates, I could not be admitted, on his recommendation, to the League of Industry. However reluctant I felt to deceive, I allowed myself to be carried away by a cruel necessity.","Manon had a most extraordinary character. No woman was ever less attached to money for its own sake, and yet she could not for a moment endure the risk of being without it. She had to have pleasures and amusements, but she would never have wanted a sou if enjoyment could have been had free of charge. So long as the day could be spent in pleasure she never troubled her head where the money came from; and so as she was not particularly addicted to gambling, nor dazzled by the mere display of wealth, it was the easiest thing in the world to satisfy her by supplying from day to day the sort of amusements she liked. But this ceaseless round of pleasures was so essential to her being, that without it there was no relying on what she might feel or do. Although she loved me tenderly, and I was the only one, as she was the first to admit, with whom she could taste the full pleasure of love, yet I was almost sure her love would never stand firm against certain kinds of anxiety. Had I had even a modest fortune she would have preferred me to anyone in the world, but I had not the slightest doubt that she would throw me over for some new B. the moment I had nothing to offer her but constancy and fidelity. With all this in mind I resolved to limit my personal expenditure so rigorously that I could always provide for hers, and to give up a multitude of necessities rather than deprive her even of superfluities. What worried me more than anything else was the upkeep of a carriage, for I could not see how to maintain horses and a coachman. I mentioned my perplexity to M. Lescaut (from whom I had not concealed my having had a hundred pistoles from a friend); and once again he said that if I wanted to try my hand at gaming he did not think it impossible that, provided I were willing to invest a hundred francs or so and treat his friends to a dinner, I might be admitted on his recommendation to the fraternity.10 I swallowed the distaste I had for swindling, and let myself be carried along by cruel necessity.","""Manon was a creature of most extraordinary disposition.   Never had mortal a greater contempt for money, and yet she was haunted by perpetual dread of wanting it.   Her only desire was for pleasure and amusement.   She would never have wished to possess a sou, if pleasure could be procured without money.   She never even cared what our purse contained, provided she could pass the day agreeably; so that, being neither fond of play nor at all dazzled by the desire of great wealth, nothing was more easy than to satisfy her, by daily finding out amusements suited to her moderate wishes.   But it became by habit a thing so absolutely necessary for her to have her mind thus occupied, that, without it, it was impossible to exercise the smallest influence over her temper or inclinations.   Although she loved me tenderly, and I was the only person, as she often declared, in whose society she could ever find the pure enjoyments of love, yet I felt thoroughly convinced that her attachment could not withstand certain apprehensions.   She would have preferred me, even with a moderate fortune, to the whole world; but I had no kind of doubt that she would, on the other hand, abandon me for some new M. de B----, when I had nothing more to offer her than fidelity and love. ""I resolved therefore so to curtail my own individual expenses, as to be able always to meet hers, and rather to deprive myself of a thousand necessaries than even to limit her extravagance.   The carriage made me more uneasy than anything else, for I saw no chance of being able to maintain either coachman or horses. ""I told M. Lescaut of my difficulties, and did not conceal from him that I had received a thousand francs from a friend.

Je me repentis de lui avoir promis un louis, non seulement parce que le présent était excessif, mais par une autre raison bien plus forte, qui était l’impuissance de le payer. Je fis appeler Lescaut. Il descendit de sa chambre pour venir à la porte. Je lui dis à l’oreille dans quel embarras je me trouvais.

I repented of having promised him a louis, not only because the present was excessive, but for another much stronger reason, which was the inability to pay it. I called Lescaut.

I regretted having promised him a louis, not only because it was an absurd sum, but for another and much better reason which was that I was not in a position to pay. I sent for Lescaut who came down from his room, and I told him in a whisper what a fix I was in.

"– Tu sauras donc, reprit mon père, puisque tu l’ignores, que M. B... a gagné le cœur de ta princesse, car il se moque de moi, de prétendre me persuader que c’est par un zèle désintéressé pour mon service qu’il a voulu te l’enlever. C’est bien d’un homme tel que lui, de qui, d’ailleurs, je ne suis pas connu, qu’il faut attendre des sentiments si nobles ! Il a su d’elle que tu es mon fils, et pour se délivrer de tes importunités, il m’a écrit le lieu de ta demeure et le désordre où tu vivais, en me faisant entendre qu’il fallait main-forte pour s’assurer de toi. Il s’est offert de me faciliter les moyens de te saisir au collet, et c’est par sa direction et celle de ta maîtresse même que ton frère a trouvé le moment de te prendre sans vert. Félicite-toi maintenant de la durée de ton triomphe. Tu sais vaincre assez rapidement, chevalier ; mais tu ne sais pas conserver tes conquêtes.","“You will know then,” resumed my father, “since you do not know it, that M. B. has won the heart of your princess, for he makes fun of me, for pretending to persuade me that it is through disinterested zeal for my service that he wanted to take it away from you. It is indeed from a man like him, by whom, moreover, I am not known, that one must expect such noble sentiments! He learned from her that you are my son, and to get rid of your importunities, he wrote to me about your place of residence and the disorder in which you lived, making me understand that a strong hand was needed to save himself. sure of yourself. He offered to facilitate the means of seizing you by the collar, and it was by his direction and that of your mistress herself that your brother found the moment to take you without a green. Congratulate yourself now on the duration of your triumph. You know how to win fairly quickly, knight; but you do not know how to preserve your conquests.","It’s all nonsense for him to make out that he wanted to get you away from her out of purely disinterested regard for my feelings. Just as though we could expect such noble sentiments from a man of his sort. Why, he doesn’t even know me! He found out from her who your father was, and simply to get rid of you he wrote giving me your address and an account of your goings-on, taking care to give me to understand that force would be needed to make sure of you. He offered to find means of laying hands on you, and your brother caught you napping on information supplied by him and the lady herself. Now pat yourself on the back on your long success. You can conquer pretty quickly, my son, but you don’t know how to safeguard your conquests.’","`You must know then,' continued my father, `since you appear as yet ignorant of it, that M. de B---- has won the affections of your idol; for he can't be serious in pretending that it is his disinterested regard for me that has induced him to take her from you.   It would be absurd to expect such noble sentiments from a man of his description, and one, besides, who is a perfect stranger to me.   He knew that you were my son, and in order to get rid of you, he wrote to inform me of your abode, and of the life you led; saying, at the same time, that strong measures would be necessary to secure you. He offered to procure me the means of laying hold of you; and it was by his direction, as well as that of your mistress herself, that your brother hit upon the moment for catching you unawares.   Now, you may congratulate yourself upon the duration of your triumph.   You know how to conquer, rapid enough; but you have yet to learn how to secure your conquests.'"
"Les vacances arrivant, je me préparais à retourner chez mon père, qui m’avait promis de m’envoyer bientôt à l’Académie. Mon seul regret, en quittant Amiens, était d’y laisser un ami avec lequel j’avais toujours été tendrement uni. Il était de quelques années plus âgé que moi. Nous avions été élevés ensemble, mais le bien de sa maison étant des plus médiocres, il était obligé de prendre l’état ecclésiastique, et de demeurer à Amiens après moi, pour y faire les études qui conviennent à cette profession. Il avait mille bonnes qualités. Vous le connaîtrez par les meilleures dans la suite de mon histoire, et surtout, par un zèle et une générosité en amitié qui surpassent les plus célèbres exemples de l’antiquité. Si j’eusse alors suivi ses conseils, j’aurais toujours été sage et heureux. Si j’avais, du moins, profité de ses reproches dans le précipice où mes passions m’ont entraîné, j’aurais sauvé quelque chose du naufrage de ma fortune et de ma réputation. Mais il n’a point recueilli d’autre fruit de ses soins que le chagrin de les voir inutiles et, quelquefois, durement récompensés par un ingrat qui s’en offensait et qui les traitait d’importunités.","With the holidays coming, I was getting ready to go back to my father, who had promised to send me to the Academy soon. My only regret, on leaving Amiens, was to leave behind a friend with whom I had always been tenderly united. He was a few years older than me. We had been brought up together, but the good of his house being of the most mediocre, he was obliged to take the ecclesiastical state, and to remain at Amiens after me, to do there the studies which are suitable for this profession. He had a thousand good qualities. You will know him by the best in the course of my history, and above all, by a zeal and a generosity in friendship which surpass the most famous examples of antiquity. If I had then followed his advice, I would always have been wise and happy. If I had, at least, taken advantage of his reproaches into the precipice into which my passions have led me, I would have saved something from the shipwreck of my fortune and my reputation. But he reaped no other fruit from his care than the grief of seeing them useless and, sometimes, harshly rewarded by an ingrate who took offense at them and called them importunities.","As the vacation was beginning, I was getting ready to go home to my father who had promised to send me on to the Academy. My only regret at leaving Amiens was that it also meant leaving behind a friend from whom I had always been inseparable. He was a few years my senior and we had been brought up together, but as his family was poor he had no choice but to enter the priesthood and stay on in Amiens to take the necessary course of study. He was one of the very best of men, as you will see later in my story when you hear about his admirable qualities and his steadfast and generous friendship surpassing the most famous examples in antiquity. If only I had followed his advice at that time I should always have been good and happy. Or if I had listened to his criticisms when my passions were dragging me down to the abyss, I might at least have saved something from the wreck of my fortune and good name. But the only reward he has had has been the bitterness of seeing his loving care unavailing and more often than not brutally repulsed and taken for an insult and a nuisance.","The vacation having arrived, I was preparing to return to my father, who had promised to send me soon to the Academy. ""My only regret on quitting Amiens arose from parting with a friend, some years older than myself, to whom I had always been tenderly attached.   We had been brought up together; but from the straitened circumstances of his family, he was intended to take orders, and was to remain after me at Amiens to complete the requisite studies for his sacred calling.   He had a thousand good qualities.   You will recognise in him the very best during the course of my history, and above all, a zeal and fervour of friendship which surpass the most illustrious examples of antiquity.   If I had at that time followed his advice, I should have always continued a discreet and happy man.   If I had even taken counsel from his reproaches, when on the brink of that gulf into which my passions afterwards plunged me, I should have been spared the melancholy wreck of both fortune and reputation.   But he was doomed to see his friendly admonitions disregarded; nay, even at times repaid by contempt from an ungrateful wretch, who often dared to treat his fraternal conduct as offensive and officious."
"– Vous êtes d’un naturel si doux et si aimable, me dit-il un jour que je ne puis comprendre les désordres dont on vous accuse. Deux choses m’étonnent : l’une, comment, avec de si bonnes qualités, vous avez pu vous livrer à l’excès du libertinage ; et l’autre que j’admire encore plus, comment vous recevez si volontiers mes conseils et mes instructions, après avoir vécu plusieurs années dans l’habitude du désordre. Si c’est repentir, vous êtes un exemple signalé des miséricordes du Ciel ; si c’est bonté naturelle, vous avez du moins un excellent fond de caractère, qui me fait espérer que nous n’aurons pas besoin de vous retenir ici longtemps, pour vous ramener à une vie honnête et réglée.","“You are so gentle and amiable by nature,” he said to me one day, “that I cannot understand the disorders of which you are accused. Two things astonish me: one, how, with such good qualities, you were able to indulge in excessive licentiousness; and the other, which I admire even more, how you receive my advice and instructions so willingly, after having lived many years in the habit of disorder. If it is repentance, you are a signal example of the mercies of Heaven; if it is natural goodness, you have at least an excellent background of character, which makes me hope that we shall not need to detain you here long, to bring you back to an honest and orderly life.","‘You have such a good and gentle disposition,’ he said one day, ‘that I cannot comprehend the excesses you are accused of. Two things astonish me: one is how, with all your great qualities, you can have given yourself over to such dissipation, and the other, which I find even more difficult to understand, is how you heed my advice and instruction so meekly after living for several years in habitual vice. If it is repentance, you are a signal example of the mercy of God; if it is natural goodness, at least it means that your character is unimpaired, and that leads me to hope that we shall not need to hold you here for long before we can bring you back to a sane and balanced life.’","""`You appear to me,' said he one day, `of a disposition so mild and tractable, that I cannot comprehend the excesses into which you have fallen.   Two things astonish me: one is, how, with your good qualities, you could have ever abandoned yourself to vice; and the other, which amazes me still more, is, how you can receive with such perfect temper my advice and instructions, after having lived so long in a course of debauchery.   If it be sincere repentance, you present a singular example of the benign mercy of Heaven; if it proceed from the natural goodness of your disposition, then you certainly have that within you which warrants the hope that a protracted residence in this place will not be required to bring you back to a regular and respectable life.'"
"– Ah Dieux ! m’écriai-je, vous pleurez, ma chère Manon ; vous êtes affligée jusqu’à pleurer, et vous ne me dites pas un seul mot de vos peines.","– Oh Gods! I exclaimed, you are crying, my dear Manon; you are afflicted to the point of crying, and you do not say a single word to me of your sorrows.","And then I saw that her eyes were shining with tears – treacherous tears! ‘Ah, dearest Manon,’ I cried, ‘you are weeping, you are moved to tears, and you won’t tell me anything about your troubles.’","`Oh heavens!' I cried, `my dearest Manon, why allow your sorrows to afflict you to this degree without imparting their cause to me?'  "
"Ce compliment devait le surprendre. Il demeura quelque temps à me considérer sans me répondre. Comme je n’en avais pas à perdre, je repris la parole pour lui dire que j’étais fort touché de toutes ses bontés, mais que, la liberté étant le plus cher de tous les biens, surtout pour moi à qui on la ravissait injustement, j’étais résolu de me la procurer cette nuit même, à quelque prix que ce fût ; et de peur qu’il ne lui prît envie d’élever la voix pour appeler du secours, je lui fis voir une honnête raison de silence, que je tenais sous mon juste-au-corps.","This compliment must have surprised him. He remained for some time looking at me without answering me. As I had nothing to lose, I spoke again to tell him that I was very touched by all his kindness, but that, freedom being the dearest of all goods, especially for me from whom it was stolen unjustly, I had resolved to procure it that very night, at whatever price; and for fear that he should feel like raising his voice to call for help, I showed him an honest reason for silence, which I kept under my jerkin.","This polite speech must have astonished him. He looked me up and down for some time without saying a word. As I had no time to lose I went on to say that I had been most touched by his kindness, but that liberty being the most precious of all possessions, especially for one unjustly deprived of it , I was determined to get it that night and at any price. For fear he might take it into his head to raise his voice and call for help I let him see the very convincing argument for silence that I had under my jacket.","""This compliment to his friendship seemed to surprise him.   He stood for a few moments looking at me without making any reply.   Finding that I had no time to lose, I just begged to assure him that I had the most lively sense of all his kindnesses, but that freedom was dearer to man than every other consideration, especially so to me, who had been cruelly and unjustly deprived of it; that I was resolved this night to recover it, cost what it would, and fearing lest he might raise his voice and call for assistance , I let him see the powerful incentive to silence which I had kept concealed in my bosom.

Il avait assez de bon sens pour en apercevoir toutes les difficultés, mais il fut assez généreux pour entreprendre de les surmonter. Nous employâmes une partie de la nuit à raisonner sur mon dessein. Il me parla des trois soldats aux gardes, dont il s’était servi dans la dernière occasion, comme de trois braves à l’épreuve. M. de T... m’avait informé exactement du nombre des archers qui devaient conduire Manon ; ils n’étaient que six. Cinq hommes hardis et résolus suffisaient pour donner l’épouvante à ces misérables, qui ne sont point capables de se défendre honorablement lorsqu’ils peuvent éviter le péril du combat par une lâcheté.

My silence leaving her free to continue, she told me that for three weeks I had not spent a whole day with her; that she could not endure such long absences; that she asked me at least a day, at intervals; and that, the very next day, she wanted to see me near her from morning till night.","He called on Heaven to witness to his good faith.

"J’écoutai ce discours avec beaucoup de patience. J’y trouvais assurément quantité de traits cruels et mortifiants pour moi, car le dessein de son infidélité était si clair qu’elle n’avait pas même eu le soin de me le déguiser. Elle ne pouvait espérer que G... M... la laissât, toute la nuit, comme une vestale. C’était donc avec lui qu’elle comptait de la passer. Quel aveu pour un amant ! Cependant, je considérai que j’étais cause en partie de sa faute, par la connaissance que je lui avais donnée d’abord des sentiments que G... M... avait pour elle, et par la complaisance que j’avais eue d’entrer aveuglément dans le plan téméraire de son aventure. D’ailleurs, par un tour naturel de génie qui m’est particulier je fus touché de l’ingénuité de son récit, et de cette manière bonne et ouverte avec laquelle elle me racontait jusqu’aux circonstances dont j’étais le plus offensé. Elle pèche sans malice, disais-je en moi-même ; elle est légère et imprudente, mais elle est droite et sincère. Ajoutez que l’amour suffisait seul pour me fermer les yeux sur toutes ses fautes. J’étais trop satisfait de l’espérance de l’enlever le soir même à mon rival.","I listened to this speech with great patience. I certainly found in it a number of cruel and mortifying traits for me, for the design of her infidelity was so clear that she had not even taken the trouble to disguise it from me. She could not hope that G... M... would leave her, all night, like a vestal. It was therefore with him that she intended to spend it. What a confession for a lover! However, I considered that I was partly the cause of her fault, by the knowledge that I had first given her of the feelings that G... M... had for her, and by the complaisance that I had had to enter blindly into the reckless plan of his adventure. Besides, by a natural turn of genius which is peculiar to me, I was touched by the ingenuousness of her story, and by that good and open manner in which she related to me even the circumstances by which I was most offended. She sins without malice, I said to myself; she is light and reckless, but she is upright and sincere. Add that love alone sufficed to close my eyes to all its faults. I was too satisfied with the hope of snatching it that very evening from my rival.","I HEARD this tale through very patiently. It is true that it contained many cruel and mortifying things from my point of view, for her disloyal intentions were so clear that she had not even taken the trouble to disguise them. She could hardly expect G. M. to leave her alone all that night like a vestal virgin, and it was therefore with him that she proposed to spend it. What an admission to make to a lover! And yet I reflected that I was partly responsible for her doing this, through having made G. M.’s sentiments known to her in the first instance and through my complaisance in blindly lending myself to the rash idea of this adventure. Besides, by a natural reaction peculiar to my type of mind, I was impressed by the candour of her story and by the frank and open way she retailed even circumstances most calculated to give me offence. I told myself that there was no malice in her sins; she was fickle and imprudent but straightforward and honest. Moreover, of course, love was in itself enough to shut my eyes to all her misdeeds. I was only too delighted at the prospect of snatching her back from my rival that very night.","""I listened to her with great patience.   There were certainly parts of her recital sufficiently cruel and mortifying; for the intention, at least, of the infidelity was so obvious, that she had not even taken the trouble to disguise it.   She could never have imagined that G---- M---- meant to venerate her as a vestal.   She must therefore clearly have made up her mind to pass at least one night with him.   What an avowal for a lover's ears!   However, I considered myself as partly the cause of her guilt, by having been the first to let her know G---- M----'s sentiments towards her, and by the silly readiness with which I entered into this rash project.   Besides, by a natural bent of my mind, peculiar I believe to myself, I was duped by the ingenuousness of her story--by that open and winning manner with which she related even the circumstances most calculated to annoy me.   `There is nothing of wanton vice,' said I to myself, `in her transgressions; she is volatile and imprudent, but she is sincere and affectionate.'   My love alone rendered me blind to all her faults.   I was enchanted at the prospect of rescuing her that very night from my rival.  "

I gave him a thousand welcomes, and ordered that they should supply him with everything he wanted.   He did not wait to be solicited for the history of his life.  "
"– Pour ce qui regarde votre délivrance, continua Lescaut, c’est une entreprise moins facile que vous ne pensez. Nous passâmes hier la soirée, deux de mes amis et moi, à observer toutes les parties extérieures de cette maison, et nous jugeâmes que, vos fenêtres étant sur une cour entourée de bâtiments, comme vous nous l’aviez marqué, il y aurait bien de la difficulté à vous tirer de là. Vous êtes d’ailleurs au troisième étage, et nous ne pouvons introduire ici ni cordes ni échelles. Je ne vois donc nulle ressource du côté du dehors. C’est dans la maison même qu’il faudrait imaginer quelque artifice.","“As far as your deliverance is concerned,” continued Lescaut, “it is a less easy undertaking than you think. We spent the evening yesterday, two of my friends and I, observing all the exterior parts of this house, and we judged that, your windows being on a courtyard surrounded by buildings, as you had pointed out to us, there would be many hard to get out of there. You are, moreover, on the third floor, and we cannot introduce here either ropes or ladders. So I see no resource outside. It is in the house itself that one would have to imagine some artifice.","‘Now about setting you free,’ said Lescaut. ‘This is not such an easy job as you think. Two of my friends and I spent all yesterday evening looking at the outside of the building and we came to the conclusion that it would be very difficult to get you out, with your windows looking on to a courtyard surrounded by bricks and mortar, as you yourself told me. What’s more, you are on the third floor and we can’t bring in any ladders or ropes. So I can’t see any chance from the outside. Something will have to be worked out for an inside job.’","`As to your escape,' continued Lescaut, `it will not be so easy as you imagine.   Last evening, I and a couple of friends walked round this establishment to reconnoitre it; and we agreed that, as your windows looked into a court surrounded by buildings, as you yourself mentioned in your letter, there would be vast difficulty in getting you out.   Besides, you are on the third story, and it would be impossible to introduce ropes or ladders through the window.   I therefore see no means from without--in the house itself we must hit upon some scheme.'"
"M. de T... parla à quelques concierges de la maison qui s’empressèrent de lui offrir tout ce qui dépendait d’eux pour sa satisfaction. Il se fit montrer le quartier où Manon avait sa chambre, et l’on nous y conduisit avec une clef d’une grandeur effroyable, qui servit à ouvrir sa porte. Je demandai au valet qui nous menait, et qui était celui qu’on avait chargé du soin de la servir, de quelle manière elle avait passé le temps dans cette demeure. Il nous dit que c’était une douceur angélique ; qu’il n’avait jamais reçu d’elle un mot de dureté ; qu’elle avait versé continuellement des larmes pendant les six premières semaines après son arrivée, mais que, depuis quelque temps, elle paraissait prendre son malheur avec plus de patience, et qu’elle était occupée à coudre du matin jusqu’au soir à la réserve de quelques heures qu’elle employait à la lecture. Je lui demandai encore si elle avait été entretenue proprement. Il m’assura que le nécessaire, du moins, ne lui avait jamais manqué.","M. de T... spoke to some concierges of the house, who hastened to offer him everything that depended on them for his satisfaction. He asked to be shown the quarter where Manon had her room, and we were led there with a key of appalling size, which served to unlock her door. I asked the valet who led us, and who was the one who had been charged with the duty of serving her, how she had passed her time in this dwelling. He tells us it was angelic sweetness; that he had never received a harsh word from her; that she had continuously shed tears during the first six weeks after her arrival, but that for some time she seemed to take her misfortune with more patience, and that she was busy sewing from morning until evening at the reserve of a few hours which she employed in reading. I asked her again if she had been properly maintained. He assured me that the necessary, at least, had never failed him.","M. de T. had a word with various warders who were only too willing to do anything they could to please him. He had the block pointed out where Manon’s room was, and the attendant who took us had a gigantic key which opened the door. This man was also the one detailed to look after her, and on the way I asked him how she had spent her time. He said that she was as gentle as an angel; he had never had a hard word from her. For six weeks after her arrival she had done nothing but weep, but for some time now she seemed to be bearing her troubles more patiently, and spent all her day from morning till night sewing, apart from an hour or two set aside for reading. I renewed my inquiries whether she had been properly looked after, and he assured me that at any rate she had never lacked necessities.","""M. de T---- spoke to some of the porters of the establishment, who appeared all anxious to please him.   The quarter in which Manon's room lay was pointed out to us, and our guide carried in his hand the key of her chamber: it was of frightful size.   I asked the man who conducted us, and whose duty it was to attend to Manon , how she passed her time?   He said, that she had a temper of the most angelic sweetness; that even he, disagreeable as his official duties must render him, had never heard from her a single syllable in the nature of rebuke or harshness; that her tears had never ceased to flow during the first six weeks after her arrival, but that latterly she seemed to bear her misfortunes with more resignation, and that she employed herself from morning till night with her needle, excepting some hours that she, each day, devoted to reading.   I asked whether she had been decently provided for.   He assured me that at least she had never felt the want of necessaries."
"Il ajouta que, si le soin de sa réputation lui eût permis d’entreprendre lui-même la délivrance de ma maîtresse, il m’eût offert son bras et son épée.","He added that, if the care of his reputation had enabled him to undertake the deliverance of my mistress himself, he would have offered me his arm and his sword.","He added that if his own reputation had allowed him to take a hand personally in rescuing Manon, he would have put his arm and sword at my disposal.","He added, that if the fear of losing his character did not prevent him from embarking in such an enterprise, he would have willingly put his sword and his life at my service."
"Nous marchâmes aussi longtemps que le courage de Manon put la soutenir, c’est-à-dire environ deux lieues, car cette amante incomparable refusa constamment de s’arrêter plus tôt. Accablée enfin de lassitude, elle me confessa qu’il lui était impossible d’avancer davantage. Il était déjà nuit. Nous nous assîmes au milieu d’une vaste plaine, sans avoir pu trouver un arbre pour nous mettre à couvert. Son premier soin fut de changer le linge de ma blessure, qu’elle avait pansée elle-même avant notre départ. Je m’opposai en vain à ses volontés. J’aurais achevé de l’accabler mortellement, si je lui eusse refusé la satisfaction de me croire à mon aise et sans danger, avant que de penser à sa propre conservation. Je me soumis durant quelques moments à ses désirs. Je reçus ses soins en silence et avec honte.","We walked as long as Manon's courage could sustain her, that is to say about two leagues, for this incomparable lover constantly refused to stop sooner. Finally overwhelmed with weariness, she confessed to me that it was impossible for her to go any further. It was already night. We sat down in the middle of a vast plain, without having been able to find a tree to take cover. Her first care was to change the linen on my wound, which she had dressed herself before our departure. I resisted his wishes in vain. I would have overwhelmed him mortally, if I had refused him the satisfaction of believing me to be at my ease and without danger, before thinking of his own preservation. I submitted for a few moments to his wishes. I received his care in silence and with shame.","We walked on as long as Manon’s courage kept her going, that is to say about two leagues, for her matchless devotion made her refuse to stop sooner. At last, overcome by weariness, she had to admit that she could not go on any further. Night had already fallen. We sat down in the middle of a great plain, not having been able to find a single tree to shelter us. Her first care was to change the bandages she had tied on my wound before we set out. It was useless for me to try to stop her, and it would have put the finishing touch to her troubles if I had refused her the satisfaction of seeing me comfortable and out of danger before thinking about her own welfare. For some time I let her have her way, but I did so in silence and felt ashamed.","""We journeyed on as long as Manon's strength would permit, that is to say, about six miles; for this incomparable creature, with her usual absence of selfishness, refused my repeated entreaties to stop.   Overpowered at length by fatigue, she acknowledged the utter impossibility of proceeding farther.   It was already night: we sat down in the midst of an extensive plain, where we could not even find a tree to shelter us.   Her first care was to dress my wound, which she had bandaged before our departure. I, in vain, entreated her to desist from exertion: it would have only added to her distress if I had refused her the satisfaction of seeing me at ease and out of danger, before her own wants were attended to.   I allowed her therefore to gratify herself, and in shame and silence submitted to her delicate attentions."
"– Ô cher ami ! lui répondis-je, c’est ici que je reconnais ma misère et ma faiblesse. Hélas ! oui, c’est mon devoir d’agir comme je raisonne ! mais l’action est-elle en mon pouvoir ? De quels secours n’aurais-je pas besoin pour oublier les charmes de Manon ?","– O dear friend! I answered him, it is here that I recognize my misery and my weakness. Alas! yes, it is my duty to act as I reason! but is the action in my power? What help would I not need to forget Manon's charms?","‘ My dear fellow,’ I answered, ‘This is where I admit my unworthiness and lack of strength. Ah yes, duty says I should practise what I preach, but am I capable of any action at all? Think of the help I should need to make me forget Manon’s charms!’","`Oh! my dear friend,' replied I; `that it is which makes me conscious of my own misery and weakness: true, alas! it is indeed my duty to act according to my argument; but have I the power of governing my own actions?   What aid will enable me to forget Manon's charms?'  "
"Mon bonheur me parut d’abord établi d’une manière inébranlable. Manon était la douceur et la complaisance même. Elle avait pour moi des attentions si délicates, que je me crus trop parfaitement dédommagé de toutes mes peines. Comme nous avions acquis tous deux un peu d’expérience, nous raisonnâmes sur la solidité de notre fortune. Soixante mille francs, qui faisaient le fond de nos richesses, n’étaient pas une somme qui pût s’étendre autant que le cours d’une longue vie. Nous n’étions pas disposés d’ailleurs à resserrer trop notre dépense. La première vertu de Manon, non plus que la mienne, n’était pas l’économie. Voici le plan que je me proposai :","My happiness seemed to me at first to be established in an unshakeable manner. Manon was gentleness and kindness itself. She had such delicate attentions for me that I thought myself too perfectly compensated for all my troubles. As we had both acquired a little experience, we reasoned about the solidity of our fortune. Sixty thousand francs, which formed the basis of our wealth, was not a sum which could extend so much as the course of a long life. Besides, we were not disposed to restrict our spending too much. Manon's first virtue, no more than mine, was not economy. Here is the plan I came up with:","At first I thought that my happiness was built on unshakable foundations. Manon was sweetness and kindness itself, and the many thoughtful little attentions with which she surrounded me seemed more than a reward for all my troubles. As by now we had both had a little experience of life, we gave some thought to our financial position. Our capital of sixty thousand francs was not likely to last for a long lifetime, but neither were we inclined to cut down our expenditure too drastically. Economy was not Manon’s outstanding quality any more than it was mine. This was the plan I suggested: ‘Sixty thousand francs,’ I said, ‘might keep us going for ten years.9 If we stay at Chaillot we can manage on two thousand écus a year.","""My happiness now appeared to be secured beyond the reach of fate.   Manon was everything most sweet and amiable.   She was so delicate and so unceasing in her attentions to me, that I deemed myself but too bountifully rewarded for all my past troubles.   As we had both, by this time, acquired some experience, we discussed rationally the state of our finances.   Sixty thousand francs (the amount of our wealth) was not a sum that could be expected to last our whole life; besides, we were neither of us much disposed to control our expenses.   Manon's chief virtue assuredly was not economy, any more than it was mine.   This was my proposition.  "
"La douceur de ses regards, un air charmant de tristesse en prononçant ces paroles, ou, plutôt, l’ascendant de ma destinée qui m’entraînait à ma perte, ne me permirent pas de balancer un moment sur ma réponse. Je l’assurai que, si elle voulait faire quelque fond sur mon honneur et sur la tendresse infinie qu’elle m’inspirait déjà, j’emploierais ma vie pour la délivrer de la tyrannie de ses parents, et pour la rendre heureuse. Je me suis étonné mille fois, en y réfléchissant, d’où me venait alors tant de hardiesse et de facilité à m’exprimer ; mais on ne ferait pas une divinité de l’amour, s’il n’opérait souvent des prodiges. J’ajoutai mille choses pressantes. Ma belle inconnue savait bien qu’on n’est point trompeur à mon âge ; elle me confessa que, si je voyais quelque jour à la pouvoir mettre en liberté, elle croirait m’être redevable de quelque chose de plus cher que la vie. Je lui répétai que j’étais prêt à tout entreprendre, mais, n’ayant point assez d’expérience pour imaginer tout d’un coup les moyens de la servir je m’en tenais à cette assurance générale, qui ne pouvait être d’un grand secours pour elle et pour moi.","The gentleness of her looks, a charming air of sadness in pronouncing these words, or, rather, the ascendancy of my destiny which was leading me to my ruin, did not allow me to hesitate for a moment on my answer. I assured her that, if she wanted to make some foundation on my honor and on the infinite tenderness which she already inspired in me, I would use my life to deliver her from the tyranny of her parents, and to make her happy. I wondered a thousand times, when I reflected on it, whence came to me so much boldness and ease in expressing myself; but one would not make a divinity of love if it did not often work wonders. I added a thousand pressing things. My beautiful stranger knew well that one is not deceitful at my age; she confessed to me that, if I saw some day to be able to set her free, she would believe that she owed me something dearer than her life. I repeated to her that I was ready to undertake anything, but, not having enough experience to suddenly imagine the means of serving her, I stuck to this general assurance, which could not be a great help for her and for me.","Perhaps it was the soft appeal of her eyes as she spoke and her air of wistful sadness, or, more likely, it was the power of destiny luring me on to my destruction: at all events I did not hesitate a moment, but assured her that if she would rely on my honour and the deep affection I already felt for her, I was ready to devote my life to rescuing her from her tyrannical family and making her happy. On thinking it over since, I have been amazed time and again at my daring and the ease with which words came to me, but I suppose love would never have been called divine if it could not work miracles of this kind. I went on to invent a hundred irresistible arguments, and my beautiful stranger knew quite well that men of my age are not deceivers. She confided to me that if I could see any means of setting her free she would feel she owed me gratitude for something dearer than life itself. I said again and again that I was ready to undertake anything, but being too inexperienced to think on the spur of the moment of any plan for helping her, I went no further than this general declaration, which was not very useful either to her or to me.","The sweetness of her look, the air of sorrow with which she pronounced these words, or rather perhaps the controlling destiny which led me on to ruin, allowed me not an instant to weigh my answer.   I assured her that if she would place reliance on my honour, and on the tender interest with which she had already inspired me, I would sacrifice my life to deliver her from the tyranny of her parents, and to render her happy.   I have since been a thousand times astonished in reflecting upon it, to think how I could have expressed myself with so much boldness and facility; but love could never have become a divinity, if he had not often worked miracles. ""I made many other pressing and tender speeches; and my unknown fair one was perfectly aware that mine was not the age for deceit.   She confessed to me that if I could see but a reasonable hope of being able to effect her enfranchisement, she should deem herself indebted for my kindness in more than life itself could pay.   I repeated that I was ready to attempt anything in her behalf; but, not having sufficient experience at once to imagine any reasonable plan of serving her , I did not go beyond this general assurance, from which indeed little good could arise either to her or to myself.  "
"Elle se plaignit tendrement de ma défiance, et elle me renouvela tous ses serments. Son compte était d’arriver à Paris sur les trois heures. Je partis après elle. J’allais me morfondre, le reste de l’après-midi, dans le café de Féré, au pont Saint-Michel ; j’y demeurai jusqu’à la nuit. J’en sortis alors pour prendre un fiacre, que je postai, suivant notre projet, à l’entrée de la rue Saint-André-des-Arcs ; ensuite je gagnai à pied la porte de la Comédie. Je fus surpris de n’y pas trouver Marcel, qui devait être à m’attendre. Je pris patience pendant une heure, confondu dans une foule de laquais, et l’œil ouvert sur tous les passants. Enfin, sept heures étant sonnées, sans que j’eusse rien aperçu qui eût rapport à nos desseins, je pris un billet de parterre pour aller voir si je découvrirais Manon et G... M... dans les loges. Ils n’y étaient ni l’un ni l’autre. Je retournai à la porte, où je passai encore un quart d’heure, transporté d’impatience et d’inquiétude. N’ayant rien vu paraître, je rejoignis mon fiacre, sans pouvoir m’arrêter à la moindre résolution. Le cocher, m’ayant aperçu, vint quelques pas au-devant de moi pour me dire, d’un air mystérieux, qu’une jolie demoiselle m’attendait depuis une heure dans le carrosse ; qu’elle m’avait demandé, à des signes qu’il avait bien reconnus, et qu’ayant appris que je devais revenir, elle avait dit qu’elle ne s’impatienterait point à m’attendre. Je me figurai aussitôt que c’était Manon. J’approchai ; mais je vis un joli petit visage, qui n’était pas le sien. C’était une étrangère, qui me demanda d’abord si elle n’avait pas l’honneur de parler à M. le chevalier des Grieux. Je lui dis que c’était mon nom.","She complained tenderly of my mistrust, and she renewed all her oaths to me. His plan was to arrive in Paris at three o'clock. I left after her. I was going to mope, the rest of the afternoon, in the café de Féré, at the Saint-Michel bridge; I stayed there until nightfall. I then left to take a cab, which I posted, according to our plan, at the entrance to the rue Saint-André-des-Arcs; then I walked to the Porte de la Comédie. I was surprised not to find Marcel there, who must have been waiting for me. I was patient for an hour, confused in a crowd of lackeys, and my eyes open on all passers-by. Finally, seven o'clock being struck, without my having seen anything that had any bearing on our plans, I took a ticket from the pit to go and see if I could discover Manon and G... M... in the boxes. Neither of them was there. I returned to the door, where I spent another quarter of an hour, transported with impatience and uneasiness. Having seen nothing appear, I returned to my cab, unable to stop at the slightest resolution. The coachman, having seen me, came a few steps in front of me to tell me, with a mysterious air, that a pretty young lady had been waiting for me for an hour in the carriage; that she had asked for me, by signs which he had well recognized, and that having learned that I was to return, she had said that she would not be impatient in waiting for me. I immediately imagined that it was Manon. I approached; but I saw a pretty little face, which was not his. She was a stranger, who first asked me if she had not the honor of speaking to the Chevalier des Grieux. I told him that was my name.","She tenderly scolded me for my lack of trust, and repeated all her protestations. Her idea was to get to Paris about three. I left a little later and went and froze all the afternoon at the Café de Féré, by the Pont Saint-Michel. I stayed there until nightfall and then left to take a cab which I posted at the corner of the Rue Saint-André-des-Arts, as we had arranged.17 Then I walked to the door of the theatre. I was surprised not to find Marcel, who should have been waiting for me there. I waited patiently for an hour amidst a crowd of lackeys, anxiously scanning all the passers-by. At length, when it was well past seven and I had seen nothing with any bearing on our plan, I bought a ticket for the floor of the house in order to see whether Manon and G. M. were to be found in the boxes. They were not, either of them. I went back to the door, where I spent another quarter of an hour in a fever of impatience and anxiety. But I saw nothing, could not make up my mind to do anything definite, and so found my way back to the cab. The driver saw me and came forward a few steps to meet me, saying mysteriously that a pretty young lady had been waiting in the carriage for an hour. She had asked for me, giving a description that he recognized, and having been told that I was coming back she had said that she would not mind waiting. I supposed it must be Manon, and hurried on. But I saw a pretty little face that did not belong to her. It was a stranger, who began by asking if she had not the honour of addressing M. le Chevalier des Grieux. I said that was my name.","She complained, in the tenderest tone, of my want of confidence, and renewed all her protestations of eternal love. ""She was to be in Paris at three o'clock.   I went some time after.   I spent the remainder of the afternoon moping in the Cafe de Fere, near the Pont St. Michel.   I remained there till nightfall.   I then hired a hackney-coach, which I placed, according to our plan, at the end of the street of St. Andre-des-arcs, and went on foot to the door of the theatre.   I was surprised at not seeing Marcel, who was to have been there waiting for me.   I waited patiently for a full hour, standing among a crowd of lackeys, and gazing at every person that passed.   At length, seven o'clock having struck, without my being able to discover anything or any person connected with our project, I procured a pit ticket, in order to ascertain if Manon and G---- M---- were in the boxes.   Neither one nor the other could I find.   I returned to the door, where I again stopped for a quarter of an hour, in an agony of impatience and uneasiness.   No person appeared, and I went back to the coach, without knowing what to conjecture.   The coachman, seeing me, advanced a few paces towards me, and said, with a mysterious air, that a very handsome young person had been waiting more than an hour for me in the coach; that she described me so exactly that he could not be mistaken, and having learned that I intended to return, she said she would enter the coach and wait with patience. ""`I felt confident that it was Manon.   I approached.   I beheld a very pretty face, certainly, but alas, not hers.   The lady asked, in a voice that I had never before heard, whether she had the honour of speaking to the Chevalier des Grieux?   I answered, `That is my name.'  "
"– Hélas ! repris-je, après un moment de silence, il n’est que trop vrai que je suis le malheureux objet de la plus lâche de toutes les perfidies. Oui, continuai-je, en versant des larmes de dépit, je vois bien que je ne suis qu’un enfant. Ma crédulité ne leur coûtait guère à tromper. Mais je sais bien ce que j’ai à faire pour me venger.","– Alas! said I, after a moment of silence, it is only too true that I am the unfortunate object of the most cowardly of all perfidies. Yes, I continued, shedding tears of annoyance, I see that I am only a child. My credulity cost them little to deceive. But I know what I have to do to get revenge.","yes,’ I went on after a pause, ‘it is all too true that I am the wretched dupe of the meanest of tricks. Yes, I agree that I must still be only a baby, for they found it the easiest thing in the world to exploit my gullibility. But I know what to do for revenge.’","`Alas!' replied I, after a moment's silence, `it is but too true that I am the unhappy victim of the vilest perfidy.   Yes,' I continued, while shedding tears of anger, `I too clearly perceive that I am indeed but a child.   Credulity like mine was easily gulled; but I shall be at no loss to revenge myself.'  "
"J’écoutai son discours jusqu’à la fin. Il y avait là bien des choses satisfaisantes. Je fus ravi, premièrement, de n’avoir rien à craindre du côté de Saint-Lazare. Les rues de Paris me redevenaient un pays libre. En second lieu, je m’applaudis de ce que Tiberge n’avait pas la moindre idée de la délivrance de Manon et de son retour avec moi. Je remarquais même qu’il avait évité de me parler d’elle, dans l’opinion, apparemment, qu’elle me tenait moins au cœur puisque je paraissais si tranquille sur son sujet. Je résolus, sinon de retourner dans ma famille, du moins d’écrire à mon père, comme il me le conseillait, et de lui témoigner que j’étais disposé à rentrer dans l’ordre de mes devoirs et de ses volontés. Mon espérance était de l’engager à m’envoyer de l’argent, sous prétexte de faire mes exercices à l’Académie, car j’aurais eu peine à lui persuader que je fusse dans la disposition de retourner à l’état ecclésiastique. Et dans le fond, je n’avais nul éloignement pour ce que je voulais lui promettre. J’étais bien aise, au contraire, de m’appliquer à quelque chose d’honnête et de raisonnable, autant que ce dessein pourrait s’accorder avec mon amour Je faisais mon compte de vivre avec ma maîtresse et de faire en même temps mes exercices ; cela était fort compatible. Je fus si satisfait de toutes ces idées que je promis à Tiberge de faire partir le jour même, une lettre pour mon père. J’entrai effectivement dans un bureau d’écriture, en le quittant, et j’écrivis d’une manière si tendre et si soumise, qu’en relisant ma lettre, je me flattai d’obtenir quelque chose du cœur paternel.","I listened to his speech until the end. There were a lot of satisfying things there. I was delighted, first, to have nothing to fear from Saint-Lazare. The streets of Paris once again became a free country. Secondly, I congratulate myself on the fact that Tiberge had not the slightest idea of Manon's deliverance and her return with me. I even noticed that he had avoided talking to me about her, in the opinion, apparently, that she meant less to me since I seemed so quiet about her. I resolved, if not to return to my family, at least to write to my father, as he advised me, and to testify to him that I was ready to return to the order of my duties and his wishes. My hope was to induce him to send me money, under the pretext of doing my exercises at the Academy, for I would have had difficulty in persuading him that I was in a disposition to return to the ecclesiastical state. And deep down, I had no qualms about what I wanted to promise her. I was quite happy, on the contrary, to apply myself to something honest and reasonable, as much as this design could agree with my love. exercises; it was very compatible. I was so satisfied with all these ideas that I promised Tiberge to send a letter for my father the same day. I actually went into a writing office, on leaving it, and I wrote in such a tender and submissive manner, that in rereading my letter, I flattered myself that I was obtaining something from the paternal heart.","I heard this speech out to the end. There were several reassuring features about it. First of all I was overjoyed to have nothing more to fear from Saint-Lazare; once again the streets of Paris were a free country for me. Secondly I congratulated myself that Tiberge had no idea that Manon was at liberty and back with me. I did not fail to notice that he had avoided mentioning her name to me, presumably because he thought my apparent calmness about her meant that she was beginning to lose her hold on my affections. I decided, if not to return to my family, at least to write to my father, as Tiberge suggested, and to express my readiness to come back to a sense of duty and obedience. I hoped by this means to cajole some money out of him, on the pretext that I was going to study at the Academy, for I should have been hard put to it to convince him that I was in a frame of mind to take up an ecclesiastical calling again. And, seriously, I was not at all averse from what I was prepared to promise him; on the contrary, I was really looking forward with pleasure to taking up something regular and intellectual, insofar as it would fit in with my love. I reckoned that I could live with Manon and do my studies at the same time. The two things were perfectly compatible! These ideas pleased me so much that I promised Tiberge to send off a letter to my father that very day. When I left him I did in fact go to a public writing-room and wrote such an affectionate and submissive letter that when I read it over I flattered myself that it would coax something out of the paternal heart.","""I listened to him attentively till he had finished.   There was much in what he said to gratify me.   In the first place, I was delighted to learn that I had nothing to fear on account of St. Lazare--the streets of Paris at least were again open to me.   Then I rejoiced to find that Tiberge had no suspicion of Manon's escape, and her return to my arms.   I even remarked that he had not mentioned her name, probably from the idea that, by my seeming indifference to her, she had become less dear to my heart.   I resolved, if not to return home, at least to write to my father, as he advised me, and to assure him that I was disposed to return to my duty, and consult his wishes.   My intention was to urge him to send me money for the purpose of pursuing my ordinary studies at the University, for I should have found it difficult to persuade him that I had any inclination to resume my ecclesiastical habit.   I was in truth not at all averse to what I was now going to promise him.   On the contrary, I was ready to apply myself to some creditable and rational pursuit, so far as the occupation would be compatible with my love.   I reckoned upon being able to live with my mistress, and at the same time continuing my studies.   I saw no inconsistency in this plan. ""These thoughts were so satisfactory to my mind, that I promised Tiberge to dispatch a letter by that day's post to my father: in fact, on leaving him, I went into a scrivener's, and wrote in such a submissive and dutiful tone, that, on reading over my own letter, I anticipated the triumph I was going to achieve over my father's heart."
"– Point de bruit, mon père, répétais-je de mon côté à tout moment.","“Don't make a sound, father,” I repeated on my side at all times.","And each time I replied, ‘Not so much noise, Father.’","`No noise, good Father, no noise,' I as often answered in my turn.  "
"– Non, non, lui dis-je, c’est pour moi un sort digne d’envie que d’être malheureux avec vous.","“No, no,” I said to him, “it is an enviable fate for me to be unhappy with you.","‘No, no,’ I said, ‘for me it is an enviable lot to be unhappy with you.’","""`No, no, Manon,' said I; `it is but too enviable a lot, in my estimation, to be allowed to share your misfortunes.'"
Les archers nous prièrent de ne pas les faire attendre plus longtemps. Ils avaient un carrosse à la porte. Je tendis la main à Manon pour descendre.,The archers begged us not to keep them waiting any longer. They had a carriage at the door. I held out my hand to Manon to get off.,The soldiers asked us not to keep them waiting any longer: they had a carriage at the door.

"– Puis-je me flatter, repris-je doucement, que deux mois de prison, que j’ai déjà essuyés, lui paraîtront une expiation suffisante ? Il me promit de lui en parler si je le souhaitais. Je le priai instamment de me rendre ce bon office. Il m’apprit, deux jours après, que G... M... avait été si touché du bien qu’il avait entendu de moi, que non seulement il paraissait être dans le dessein de me laisser voir le jour, mais qu’il avait même marqué beaucoup d’envie de me connaître plus particulièrement, et qu’il se proposait de me rendre une visite dans ma prison. Quoique sa présence ne pût m’être agréable, je la regardais comme un acheminement prochain à ma liberté.","“Can I flatter myself,” I resumed gently, “that two months in prison, which I have already served, will seem to him a sufficient expiation? He promised to talk to him about it if I wanted to. I begged him earnestly to do me this good office. He informed me, two days later, that G... M... had been so touched by the good he had heard from me, that not only did he appear to be planning to let me see the light of day, but that he had even expressed a great desire to know me more particularly, and that he intended to pay me a visit in my prison. Although her presence could not be agreeable to me, I looked upon her as an approach to my freedom.","‘Dare I hope,’ I said in honeyed tones, ‘that he will think the two months’ imprisonment I have already served are a sufficient expiation?’ He promised to speak to him about it if I wished, and I most earnestly begged him to do me this kindness. Two days later he told me that G. M. had been so touched by the good report he had had of me that not only did he seem disposed to set me free, but had also shown a strong desire to know me better and intended to visit me. Although I could scarcely look forward to seeing him, I interpreted this visit as a further step towards liberty.","`May I flatter myself,' rejoined I, in the mildest tone, `that he will consider two months, which I have now spent in this prison, as a sufficient atonement?'   He offered to speak to him, if I wished it.   I implored him without delay to do me that favour. ""He told me two days afterwards that G---- M---- was so sensibly affected by what he had heard, that he not only was ready to consent to my liberation, but that he had even expressed a strong desire to become better acquainted with me, and that he himself purposed to pay me a visit in prison.   Although his presence could not afford me much pleasure, I looked upon it as a certain prelude to my liberation."

"Je communiquai ce projet à Manon, et je lui fis entendre qu’outre les motifs de l’amour et du devoir, celui de la nécessité pouvait y entrer aussi pour quelque chose, car nos fonds étaient extrêmement altérés, et je commençais à revenir de l’opinion qu’ils étaient inépuisables. Manon reçut froidement cette proposition. Cependant, les difficultés qu’elle y opposa n’étant prises que de sa tendresse même et de la crainte de me perdre, si mon père n’entrait point dans notre dessein après avoir connu le lieu de notre retraite, je n’eus pas le moindre soupçon du coup cruel qu’on se préparait à me porter. À l’objection de la nécessité, elle répondit qu’il nous restait encore de quoi vivre quelques semaines, et qu’elle trouverait, après cela, des ressources dans l’affection de quelques parents à qui elle écrirait en province. Elle adoucit son refus par des caresses si tendres et si passionnées, que moi, qui ne vivais que dans elle, et qui n’avais pas la moindre défiance de son cœur, j’applaudis à toutes ses réponses et à toutes ses résolutions.","I communicated this project to Manon, and I made her understand that besides the motives of love and duty, that of necessity could also enter into it for something, because our funds were extremely altered, and I was beginning to return from the opinion that they were inexhaustible. Manon received this proposal coldly. However, the difficulties that she opposed to it being taken only from her very tenderness and from the fear of losing me, if my father did not enter into our plan after having known the place of our retreat, I would not have had the slightest suspicion of the cruel blow that was about to be dealt to me. To the objection of necessity, she replied that we still had enough to live on for a few weeks, and that she would find, after that, resources in the affection of some relatives to whom she would write in the provinces. She softened her refusal with caresses so tender and so passionate that I, who lived only in her, and who had not the slightest mistrust in her heart, applauded all her answers and all her resolutions.","I spoke about it to Manon, and gave her to understand that, apart altogether from motives of filial duty, sheer necessity might soon come into the picture because our funds were running low and I was beginning to revise my opinion that they were inexhaustible. Manon heard this news with marked coolness. But as the objections she raised were based on her affection for me and the fear that when my father had found out our hiding-place she would lose me, if he did not come round to our point of view, I had not the slightest suspicion of the cruel blow being prepared for me at that very moment. She countered the argument of financial necessity by saying that we still had enough left for several weeks, and that after that she would write to some relatives in the country from whom she was sure she could manage to wheedle some money. And her refusal was softened by such tender caresses that I could not entertain the least doubt about her love, but even applauded all her arguments and plans. As I lived for her alone, how could I do otherwise?","I mentioned the project to Manon, and explained to her that, besides every motive of filial love and duty, the weightier one of necessity should also have some influence; for our finances were sadly reduced, and I began to see the folly of thinking them, as I once did, inexhaustible. ""Manon received the proposition with considerable coldness.   However, the difficulties she made, being apparently the suggestions of tenderness alone, or as arising from the natural fear of losing me, if my father, after learning our address, should refuse his assent to our union, I had not the smallest suspicion of the cruel blow she was at the very time preparing to inflict.   As to the argument of necessity, she replied that we had still abundant means of living for some weeks longer, and that she would then find a resource in the kindness of some relations in the country, to whom she should write.   She tempered her opposition by caresses so tender and impassioned, that I, who lived only for her, and who never had the slightest misgiving as to her love, applauded at once her arguments and her resolutions."

"Cependant, Tiberge continuant de me rendre de fréquentes visites, dans le dessein qu’il m’avait inspiré, je pris l’occasion d’en faire l’ouverture à mon père. Il me déclara que son intention était de laisser ses enfants libres dans le choix de leur condition et que, de quelque manière que je voulusse disposer de moi, il ne se réserverait que le droit de m’aider de ses conseils. Il m’en donna de fort sages, qui tendaient moins à me dégoûter de mon projet, qu’à me le faire embrasser avec connaissance. Le renouvellement de l’année scolastique approchait. Je convins avec Tiberge de nous mettre ensemble au séminaire de Saint-Sulpice, lui pour achever ses études de théologie, et moi pour commencer les miennes. Son mérite, qui était connu de l’évêque du diocèse, lui fit obtenir de ce prélat un bénéfice considérable avant notre départ.","However, Tiberge continuing to pay me frequent visits, for the purpose he had inspired in me, I took the opportunity to open the door to my father. He told me that his intention was to leave his children free in the choice of their condition and that, in any way that I wanted to dispose of me, he would only reserve the right to help me with his advice. He gave me some very wise ones, which tended less to disgust me with my project than to make me embrace it knowingly. The renewal of the scholastic year was approaching. I agreed with Tiberge to put us together at the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice, he to complete his theological studies and I to begin mine. His merit, which was known to the bishop of the diocese, enabled him to obtain from this prelate a considerable benefice before our departure.","Meanwhile Tiberge frequently came to see me and did his best to encourage me to follow up the plan he had suggested, and I seized a chance to broach the matter with my father. He declared that he wished to leave his children a free choice of career and that, whatever I were to decide, he would not interfere but only give me his advice. And the advice he gave me was very wise and, far from turning me away from my project, it made me go into it with my eyes open. It was almost time for the beginning of the academic year, and I agreed with Tiberge that we would go up together to the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, where he could finish his theology and I could start mine. He was very well thought of by the bishop of our diocese, and through him he was awarded a generous grant before we left.","""However, Tiberge continuing to pay me frequent visits in order to strengthen me in the purpose with which he had inspired me, I took an opportunity of opening the subject to my father.   He declared that his intention ever was to leave his children free to choose a profession, and that in whatever manner I should dispose of myself, all he wished to reserve was the right of aiding me with his counsel.   On this occasion he gave me some of the wisest, which tended less to divert me from my project, than to convince me of my good father's sound judgment and discretion. The recommencement of the scholastic year being at hand, Tiberge and I agreed to enter ourselves together at St. Sulpice, he to pursue his theological studies, and I to begin mine.   His merits, which were not unknown to the bishop of the diocese, procured him the promise of a living from that prelate before our departure."

It only remains for us to think out how best to take advantage of your kindness and fulfil your promise.’","`Lescaut,' said I, putting my hands to my eyes as if to shut out such a horrifying vision, `if your intention was to render me a service, I give you thanks.

B...","He told me how, after realizing that I had deceived him and gone off with Manon, he had taken horse to follow me, but as we had four or five hours’ start he had found it impossible to overtake me. Nevertheless he had reached Saint-Denis only half an hour after I had left. Being fairly certain that I would stay in Paris, he had spent six weeks vainly searching for me; he had been to all the places where he thought I might be found, and eventually one day he had recognized Manon in a theatre. She was so gorgeously attired that he thought she must owe such opulence to a new lover. He had followed her carriage home and found out from a servant that she was being kept by M. de B.","He then told me how, after discovering that I had deceived him, and gone off with my mistress, he procured horses for the purpose of pursuing me, but having the start of him by four or five hours, he found it impossible to overtake me; that he arrived, however, at St. Denis half an hour after I had left it; that, being very sure that I must have stopped in Paris, he spent six weeks there in a fruitless endeavour to discover me--visiting every place where he thought he should be likely to meet me, and that one evening he at length recognised my mistress at the play, where she was so gorgeously dressed, that he of course set it down to the account of some new lover; that he had followed her equipage to her house, and had there learned from a servant that she was entertained in this style by M. de B----.

"Ce sentiment était vrai ; cependant, dans le temps que je faisais si peu de cas des biens du monde, je sentais que j’aurais eu besoin d’en avoir du moins une petite partie, pour mépriser encore plus souverainement tout le reste. L’amour est plus fort que l’abondance, plus fort que les trésors et les richesses, mais il a besoin de leur secours ; et rien n’est plus désespérant, pour un amant délicat, que de se voir ramené par là, malgré lui, à la grossièreté des âmes les plus basses.","This feeling was real; however, in the time when I had so little regard for the goods of the world, I felt that I needed to have had at least a small part of them, in order to despise all the rest still more sovereignly. Love is stronger than abundance, stronger than treasures and riches, but it needs their help; and nothing is more despairing for a delicate lover than to see himself reduced thereby, in spite of himself, to the coarseness of the lowest souls.","There was some truth in the sentiment; but, all the same, at that moment when I was so lightly dismissing this world’s possessions I felt that I could have done with just a small share of them, if only so as to be able to scorn the rest more loftily. Love is stronger than wealth, mightier than treasures and riches, but it can do with their help; and nothing is more exasperating to a delicate-minded lover than to see himself brought, willy-nilly, down to the level of coarser souls simply through lack of money.","""This sentiment was true; however, while I so lightly esteemed the good things of the world, I felt that there was no doing without some little portion of them, were it only to inspire a more thorough contempt for the remainder.   Love is more powerful than wealth--more attractive than grandeur or fame; but, alas! it cannot exist without certain artificial aids; and there is nothing more humiliating to the feelings, of a sensitive lover, than to find himself, by want of means, reduced to the level of the most vulgar minds."
"Il vint effectivement à Saint-Lazare. Je lui trouvai l’air plus grave et moins sot qu’il ne l’avait eu dans la maison de Manon. Il me tint quelques discours de bon sens sur ma mauvaise conduite. Il ajouta, pour justifier apparemment ses propres désordres, qu’il était permis à la faiblesse des hommes de se procurer certains plaisirs que la nature exige, mais que la friponnerie et les artifices honteux méritaient d’être punis. Je l’écoutai avec un air de soumission dont il parut satisfait. Je ne m’offensai pas même de lui entendre lâcher quelques railleries sur ma fraternité avec Lescaut et Manon, et sur les petites chapelles dont il supposait, me dit-il, que j’avais dû faire un grand nombre à Saint-Lazare, puisque je trouvais tant de plaisir à cette pieuse occupation. Mais il lui échappa, malheureusement pour lui et pour moi-même, de me dire que Manon en aurait fait aussi, sans doute, de fort jolies à l’hôpital. Malgré le frémissement que le nom d’hôpital me causa, j’eus encore le pouvoir de le prier, avec douceur de s’expliquer.","He actually came to Saint-Lazare. I thought he looked more serious and less stupid than he had in Manon's house. He gave me a few common-sense speeches about my bad behavior. He added, in apparent justification of his own disorders, that the weakness of men was permitted to procure certain pleasures which nature requires, but that cheating and shameful artifice deserved punishment. I listened to him with an air of submission with which he seemed satisfied. I was not offended even to hear him sneer at my fraternity with Lescaut and Manon, and at the little chapels of which he supposed, he told me, that I must have made a large number at Saint-Lazare, since I found so much pleasure in this pious occupation. But it escaped him, unfortunately for him and for myself, to tell me that Manon would also, no doubt, have made some very pretty ones in the hospital. Despite the shudder that the name of hospital caused me, I still had the power to pray to him, with gentleness to explain himself.","In due course he came to Saint-Lazare. He looked more dignified and less foolish than when I had seen him in Manon’s house. He made a few edifying remarks about my misconduct, and added, apparently to justify his own goings-on, that it was permissible for men in their frailty to gratify certain of nature’s demands, but that swindling and scoundrelly trickery ought to be punished. He seemed pleased by the meekness with which I listened. I did not even take offence when he allowed himself a few jokes about my supposed family relationship with Lescaut and Manon, and the little chapels of which, he presumed, I must have made quite a number at Saint-Lazare, since I found so much enjoyment in that pious occupation. But, unfortunately for him and for me, he let slip a remark that no doubt Manon too must have made some pretty ones in the Hôpital. This word gave me a shock, but I kept enough self-control to ask him to be so good as to explain.","""He accordingly came to St. Lazare.   I met him with an air more grave and certainly less silly than I had exhibited at his house with Manon.   He spoke reasonably enough of my former bad conduct.   He added, as if to excuse his own delinquencies, that it was graciously permitted to the weakness of man to indulge in certain pleasures, almost, indeed, prompted by nature, but that dishonesty and such shameful practices ought to be, and always would be, inexorably punished. ""I listened to all he said with an air of submission, which quite charmed him.

"Tiberge n’avait pas manqué, pendant ce temps-là, de me rendre de fréquentes visites. Sa morale ne finissait point. Il recommençait sans cesse à me représenter le tort que je faisais à ma conscience, à mon honneur et à ma fortune. Je recevais ses avis avec amitié, et quoique je n’eusse pas la moindre disposition à les suivre, je lui savais bon gré de son zèle, parce que j’en connaissais la source.

His morality never ended. He constantly began to remind me of the harm I was doing to my conscience, my honor and my fortune.

Sometimes I laughed at him pleasantly, in the very presence of Manon, and I urged him not to be more scrupulous than a large number of bishops and other priests, who know very well how to grant a mistress with a benefice.","All through this period Tiberge was regular in his visits and untiring in his moralizings. Day after day he pointed out the wrong I was doing to my conscience, honour and prospects. I put up with his advice good-humouredly, though without the slightest intention of following it, and I was even grateful because I knew it came from the heart. Sometimes I chaffed him about it, even in front of Manon, and recommended him not to be more scrupulous than many a bishop and other ecclesiastic, who contrived to reconcile a mistress and a living.","""Tiberge was in the habit, at this period, of paying me frequent visits.   He was never tired of his moral lectures.   Over and over again did he represent to me the injury I was inflicting upon my conscience, my honour, and my fortune.

"Il était donc question de remplir actuellement ma bourse. M. de T... m’avait offert généreusement la sienne, mais j’avais une extrême répugnance à le remettre moi-même sur cette matière.

Only a craven little soul, so devoid of feeling that he could not see the humiliation of it, would be capable of such a thing: or else a Christian, whose real humanity and greatness of soul raised him above such diffidence. I was neither one thing nor the other, and I would have given half my blood to be spared this indignity.","""The main object now was to replenish my purse.   M. de T---- had once offered me his, but I had an extreme repugnance to mention the subject to him again.

I would have sacrificed half my life to be spared the humiliation."
"Manon parla peu. Il semblait que la honte et la douleur eussent altéré les organes de sa voix ; le son en était faible et tremblant. Elle me remercia de ne l’avoir pas oubliée, et de la satisfaction que je lui accordais, dit-elle en soupirant, de me voir du moins encore une fois et de me dire le dernier adieu. Mais, lorsque je l’eus assurée que rien n’était capable de me séparer d’elle et que j’étais disposé à la suivre jusqu’à l’extrémité du monde pour prendre soin d’elle, pour la servir, pour l’aimer et pour attacher inséparablement ma misérable destinée à la sienne, cette pauvre fille se livra à des sentiments si tendres et si douloureux, que j’appréhendai quelque chose pour sa vie d’une si violente émotion. Tous les mouvements de son âme semblaient se réunir dans ses yeux. Elle les tenait fixés sur moi. Quelquefois elle ouvrait la bouche, sans avoir la force d’achever quelques mots qu’elle commençait.

It seemed that shame and pain had altered his voice organs; the sound was weak and tremulous. She thanked me for not having forgotten her, and for the satisfaction I gave her, she said with a sigh, to see me at least once more and to say my last farewell. But when I had assured her that nothing could separate me from her and that I was ready to follow her to the end of the world to take care of her, to serve her, to To love and to attach my miserable destiny inseparably to hers, this poor girl gave herself up to feelings so tender and so painful, that I apprehended something for her life with such violent emotion.

When I assured her that nothing could tear me away from her, that I was minded to follow her to the ends of the earth to care for her, serve her, cherish her and bind my wretched fate to hers for ever, the poor girl gave way to such an outburst of love and sorrow that I feared such violent emotion might endanger her life. Every feeling in her soul seemed concentrated in her eyes, which she kept fixed on me. Now and again she opened her mouth, but had not the strength to finish the few phrases she began. But a few sentences did escape her: words of wonder at my love, tender concern at the excess of it, doubt that she could really be so happy as to have inspired such perfect devotion, pleading to make me give up this idea of following her and seek some other happiness more worthy of me, which, she said, I could not hope to find with her.","When at length we were able to speak, our conversation was not less sorrowful.   Manon said little: shame and grief appeared to have altered the character of her voice; its tone was feeble and tremulous.

She more than once opened her lips without the power of giving utterance to her thoughts.   I could, however, catch some expressions that dropped from her, of admiration and wonder at my excessive love--of doubt that she could have been fortunate enough to inspire me with a passion so perfect--of earnest entreaty that I would abandon my intention of following her, and seek elsewhere a lot more worthy of me, and which, she said, I could never hope to find with her."
"Il me pressa si fort et si longtemps de lui découvrir mon secret, que, n’ayant jamais eu de réserve avec lui, je lui fis l’entière confidence de ma passion. Il la reçut avec une apparence de mécontentement qui me fit frémir. Je me repentis surtout de l’indiscrétion avec laquelle je lui avais découvert le dessein de ma fuite.

J’étais au désespoir de m’être trahi si mal à propos. Cependant, l’amour m’ayant ouvert extrêmement l’esprit depuis deux ou trois heures, je fis attention que je ne lui avais pas découvert que mon dessein devait s’exécuter le lendemain, et je résolus de le tromper à la faveur d’une équivoque.","He pressed me so hard and for so long to reveal my secret to him that, having never had reservations with him, I confided in him the entire confidence of my passion.

He told me that he was too perfectly my friend not to oppose it with all his power; that he wanted to represent to me first of all what he believed capable of diverting me from it but that, if I did not then renounce this miserable resolution, he would warn people who could certainly arrest him. He gave me a serious speech on this which lasted more than a quarter of an hour, and which ended again with the threat of denouncing me if I did not give him my word to conduct me with more wisdom and reason. I was in despair at having betrayed myself so inappropriately. However, love having opened my mind extremely for two or three hours, I took care that I had not discovered to him that my plan was to be executed the next day, and I resolved to deceive him by favor of an ambiguity.","He urged me to let him share my secret, and pleaded so long and so earnestly that, never having hidden anything from him before, I ended by taking him into my confidence about the whole affair. He heard me with such obvious disapproval that I trembled. I was particularly vexed at having so rashly divulged my intention to run away. He said that he was too intimate a friend of mine not to oppose the idea with all his might, and that he would begin by mustering all the reasons he could think of to dissuade me. But if I did not give up such an absurd notion he would go and warn somebody in a position to stop me. Thereupon he read me a lecture lasting over a quarter of an hour, finishing up by renewed threats to inform against me unless I gave him my word of honour to behave more reasonably. I was furious at having given the game away at such an awkward moment. But in those two or three hours love had taught me many things, and now it occurred to me that I had not mentioned that the project was to be carried out the very next day. So I decided to deceive him by prevarication.","He pressed me so much and so earnestly to discover my secret, that, having never up to that moment felt the slightest reserve towards him, I confided to him now the whole history of my passion.   He heard it with an appearance of disapprobation, which made me tremble; and I immediately repented of my indiscretion, in telling him of my intended elopement.   He told me he was too sincerely my friend not to oppose every obstacle in his power to such a scheme; that he would first try all other means of turning me from such a purpose, but that if I refused to renounce so fatal a resolution, he assuredly would inform some persons of my intention, who would be able to defeat it.   He held forth upon the subject for a full quarter of an hour, in the most serious tone, and ended by again threatening to inform against me, if I did not pledge him my word that I would return to the paths of discretion and reason. ""I was in despair at having so awkwardly betrayed myself.

"Mon argent eut un fort bon effet. On me mit dans une chambre proprement meublée, et l’on m’assura que Manon en avait une pareille. Je m’occupai aussitôt des moyens de hâter ma liberté. Il était clair qu’il n’y avait rien d’absolument criminel dans mon affaire, et supposant même que le dessein de notre vol fût prouvé par la déposition de Marcel, je savais fort bien qu’on ne punit point les simples volontés. Je résolus d’écrire promptement à mon père, pour le prier de venir en personne à Paris. J’avais bien moins de honte, comme je l’ai dit, d’être au Châtelet qu’à Saint-Lazare ; d’ailleurs, quoique je conservasse tout le respect dû à l’autorité paternelle, l’âge et l’expérience avaient diminué beaucoup ma timidité.

Nous allâmes passer la nuit chez un traiteur où je me remis un peu de la mauvaise chère que j’avais faite depuis près de trois mois. Je ne pus néanmoins m’y livrer au plaisir. Je souffrais mortellement sans Manon.","However, I thanked him for having taken this precaution, without which I would doubtless be at Saint-Lazare for a long time. We went to spend the night at a caterer where I recovered a little from the bad food I had had for nearly three months. However, I could not indulge myself in it. I suffered mortally without Manon.","But all the same I thanked him for having taken this precaution, but for which I should certainly have been at Saint-Lazare for a long time. We went for the night to a tavern where I made up somewhat for the meagre fare I had had for nearly three months. But I could not really enjoy myself, for in my mind I was sharing Manon’s cruel sufferings.","I, however, could not help thanking him for having taken this precaution, without which I doubtless must have continued much longer at St. Lazare.   We went to pass the night at a tavern, where I made up, in some degree, for the miserable fare which had been doled out to me for nearly three months.   I was very far, however, from tasting perfect enjoyment; Manon's sufferings were mine.  "
"Au fond, sa frayeur me laissa de cruels doutes. Elle pouvait lui avoir fait supprimer une partie de la vérité. Cependant, après quelques réflexions, je revins de mes alarmes, jusqu’à regretter d’avoir donné cette marque de faiblesse. Je ne pouvais faire un crime à Manon d’être aimée. Il y avait beaucoup d’apparence qu’elle ignorait sa conquête ; et quelle vie allais-je mener si j’étais capable d’ouvrir si facilement l’entrée de mon cœur à la jalousie ?","Basically, his fright left me with cruel doubts. She could have made him suppress part of the truth. However, after a few reflections, I recovered from my alarms, to the point of regretting having given this mark of weakness. I couldn't make it a crime for Manon to be loved. There was much appearance that she was unaware of her conquest; and what life would I lead if I was able to open the entrance to my heart so easily to jealousy?","But all the same his embarrassment left me in agonies of doubt, for it might have made him hold back part of the truth. But when I had thought it over a little I recovered from my panic and regretted having betrayed my weakness in this way. It was no crime on Manon’s part that people fell in love with her, and everything seemed to point to her being unaware of the conquest she had made. What sort of a life was I going to lead if I was capable of harbouring jealousy so readily?","""In truth, the effect of his fright was to leave me in a state of the cruellest suspense.   It was possible that she had ordered him to suppress part of the truth.   However, after a little reflection, I recovered sufficiently from my fears to see the manner in which I had exposed my weaknesses.   I could hardly consider it a crime in Manon to be loved.   Judging from appearances, it was probable that she was not even aware of her conquest.   `And what kind of life shall I in future lead,' thought I, `if I am capable of letting jealousy so easily take possession of my mind?'"
"– Mais, mon cher fils, reprit-il d’un air pâle et effrayé, que vous ai-je fait ? quelle raison avez-vous de vouloir ma mort ?","“But, my dear son,” he resumed with a pale and frightened air, “what have I done to you? what reason do you have for wanting me dead?","‘But, my dear son,’ said he, pale and trembling, ‘what harm have I done you, what reason have you for desiring my death?’","`But, my dear son!' said he, pale and frightened, `what have I done to you?   What reason have you for taking my life?'  "
"– Aussi mépriserais-je tous les empires du monde, lui répondis-je, pour m’assurer le bonheur d’être aimé d’elle.","“And so I would despise all the empires of the world,” I answered her, “to assure myself of the happiness of being loved by her.","‘And I would scorn all the empires of the world,’ I answered, ‘for the joy of knowing I was loved by her.’","`Nor would I,' I replied, `give up her love for universal empire!'"

"– C’est trop, mon cher monsieur. Si, avec tant de bonté et d’amitié, vous me faites revoir ma chère Manon, je vous suis attaché pour toute ma vie.

If you return this dear creature to me completely, I will not believe that I am quit in shedding all my blood to serve you.","I declined, but said, ‘No, my dear Sir, you are too good. If through your great kindness and friendly help I succeed in seeing Manon again, I am your servant for life. If you restore her to me altogether, I shall think that my debt to you can never be repaid even if I shed all my blood for you.’","I refused, but said to him, `You are too kind, my dear sir!

"Il m’attaqua avec une furie inexprimable. Je dois confesser que je n’étais pas fort dans les armes, n’ayant eu que trois mois de salle à Paris. L’amour conduisait mon épée. Synnelet ne laissa pas de me percer le bras d’outre en outre, mais je le pris sur le temps et je lui fournis un coup si vigoureux qu’il tomba à mes pieds sans mouvement.","He attacked me with inexpressible fury. I must confess that I was not strong in arms, having had only three months of room in Paris. Love drove my sword. Synnelet did not fail to pierce my arm furthermore, but I caught him on the spot and gave him such a vigorous blow that he fell motionless at my feet.","He came at me with indescribable fury. I must admit that I was no great swordsman, not having had more than three months instruction in Paris, but love guided my blade.

"Comme il n’y avait rien, après tout, dans le gros de ma conduite, qui pût me déshonorer absolument, du moins en la mesurant sur celle des jeunes gens d’un certain monde, et qu’une maîtresse ne passe point pour une infamie dans le siècle où nous sommes, non plus qu’un peu d’adresse à s’attirer la fortune du jeu, je fis sincèrement à mon père le détail de la vie que j’avais menée. À chaque faute dont je lui faisais l’aveu, j’avais soin de joindre des exemples célèbres, pour en diminuer la honte.","As there was nothing, after all, in the bulk of my behavior which could dishonor me absolutely, at least by measuring it against that of young people of a certain world, and that a mistress does not pass for a infamy in the century in which we live, no more than a little skill in attracting fortune from gambling, I sincerely told my father the details of the life I had led. To each fault of which I confessed to him, I took care to add famous examples, to lessen the shame.","As there was nothing in my behaviour, taken all round, which was completely dishonourable – at least when it was compared to that of young men of a certain set – and as a mistress is not considered anything to be ashamed of nowadays, any more than a little manipulation in winning at cards, I described the life I had been leading in a detailed and candid manner. But with each misdeed I acknowledged, I was careful to complete an illustrious parallel, so as to mitigate the shame of it.","""As there really was not anything in my conduct so grossly improper as to reflect dishonour upon me; at least, in comparison with the conduct of other young men of a certain station in the world; and as a mistress is not considered a disgrace, any more than a little dexterity in drawing some advantage from play, I gave my father a candid detail of the life I had been leading.   As I recounted each transgression, I took care to cite some illustrious example in my justification, in order to palliate my own faults."

"– J’avoue, repris-je, qu’elle n’est pas juste ; mais prenez-y garde, ce n’est pas sur elle que porte mon raisonnement. J’ai eu dessein d’expliquer ce que vous regardez comme une contradiction, dans la persévérance d’un amour malheureux, et je crois avoir fort bien prouvé que, si c’en est une, vous ne sauriez vous en sauver plus que moi. C’est à cet égard seulement que j’ai traité les choses d’égales, et je soutiens encore qu’elles le sont. Répondrez-vous que le terme de la vertu est infiniment supérieur à celui de l’amour ? Qui refuse d’en convenir ? Mais est-ce de quoi il est question ? Ne s’agit-il pas de la force qu’ils ont, l’un et l’autre, pour faire supporter les peines ? Jugeons-en par l’effet. Combien trouve-t-on de déserteurs de la sévère vertu, et combien en trouverez-vous peu de l’amour ? Répondrez-vous encore que, s’il y a des peines dans l’exercice du bien, elles ne sont pas infaillibles et nécessaires ; qu’on ne trouve plus de tyrans ni de croix, et qu’on voit quantité de personnes vertueuses mener une vie douce et tranquille ? Je vous dirai de même qu’il y a des amours paisibles et fortunées, et, ce qui fait encore une différence qui m’est extrêmement avantageuse, j’ajouterai que l’amour, quoiqu’il trompe assez souvent, ne promet du moins que des satisfactions et des joies, au lieu que la religion veut qu’on s’attende à une pratique triste et mortifiante.","“I confess,” I resumed, “that it is not just; but take care, it is not on her that my reasoning bears. I had the intention of explaining what you regard as a contradiction, in the perseverance of an unhappy love, and I believe I have proved very well that, if it is one, you would not know how to save yourself from it any more than I do. . It is in this respect alone that I have treated things as equals, and I still maintain that they are. Will you reply that the term virtue is infinitely superior to that of love? Who refuses to agree? But is this what it is about? Isn't it a question of the strength that they both have to bear the pains? Let's judge by the effect. How many deserters are there from severe virtue, and how few will you find from love? Will you still answer that, if there are pains in the exercise of good, they are not infallible and necessary; that we no longer find tyrants or crosses, and that we see many virtuous people leading a sweet and quiet life? I will tell you in the same way that there are peaceful and fortunate loves, and, which still makes a difference which is extremely advantageous to me, I will add that love, although it often deceives, at least does not promise only satisfactions and joys, whereas religion wants us to expect a sad and mortifying practice.","‘I grant you,’ I replied, ‘that it is not a fair comparison, but take note that my argument does not depend on that. I simply wanted to explain what you call a contradiction in my perseverance in an unhappy love, and I think I have satisfactorily proved that, if contradiction there be, you cannot avoid falling into it any more than I can. That is the only sense in which I treated the things as equal, and I still maintain that they are. You will no doubt answer that the aim of virtue is infinitely higher than that of love. Who would gainsay that? But is that the point at issue? Aren’t we discussing the power of each of these things to enable us to bear sufferings? They must be judged by results. How many people desert the cause of strict virtue, but how few forsake that of love! Or again, perhaps you will answer that if there are difficulties in the good life they are not inevitable and necessary, that tyrants and tortures are no longer the rule and that many virtuous people nowadays lead a tranquil and happy life. But in the same way I can say that love often runs a peaceful and untroubled course, but with this difference that is most advantageous to my argument. Love, I must add, though it may often deceive us, does at least promise only satisfaction and pleasure, whereas religion expects us to be prepared for a life of gloom and mortification.’","""`I acknowledge,' said I, `that the comparison is not a just one, but my argument does not at all depend upon it.   I was about to explain what you consider a contradiction--the persevering in a painful pursuit; and I think I have satisfactorily proved, that if there be any contradiction in that, we shall be both equally obnoxious to the charge.   It was in this light, only, that I could observe no difference in our cases, and I cannot as yet perceive any. ""`You may probably answer, that the proposed end, the promised reward, of virtue, is infinitely superior to that of love?   No one disputes it, but that is not the question --we are only discussing the relative aid they both afford in the endurance of affliction.   Judge of that by the practical effect: are there not multitudes who abandon a life of strict virtue? how few give up the pursuits of love! ""`Again, you will reply that if there be difficulties in the exercise of virtue, they are by no means universal and sure; that the good man does not necessarily meet tyrants and tortures, and that, on the contrary, a life of virtue is perfectly compatible with repose and enjoyment.   I can say with equal truth, that love is often accompanied by content and happiness; and what makes another distinction of infinite advantage to my argument, I may add that love, though it often deludes, never holds out other than hopes of bliss and joy, whilst religion exacts from her votaries mortification and sorrow."

Je me connais digne de vos reproches, mais je vous conjure d’y mettre un peu plus de bonté et de ne pas me traiter comme le plus infâme de tous les hommes. Je ne mérite pas des noms si durs. C’est l’amour, vous le savez, qui a causé toutes mes fautes. Fatale passion ! Hélas ! n’en connaissez-vous pas la force, et se peut-il que votre sang, qui est la source du mien, n’ait jamais ressenti les mêmes ardeurs ?

It is love, you know, that has caused all my faults. Fatal passion! Alas! do you not know its strength, and is it possible that your blood, which is the source of mine, has never felt the same ardor?

You know that the cause of all my misdeeds is love. What a fatal passion it is! Do you know its power; can it be that your blood, which is the source of mine, has never burned with the same fires? Love has made me too soft, too passionate, too faithful and perhaps over-indulgent of the desires of a most charming woman; and that is the sum of my crimes. Do any of these things dishonour you, do you think? Please, father,’ I added affectionately, ‘have a little pity for a son who has always been devoted to you and full of respect, who has not turned his back on honour and duty as you think, and who is a thousand times more to be pitied than you can imagine.’","""`I assure you, sir,' said I to him, `that the modesty which you ridicule is by no means affected; it is the natural feeling of a son who entertains sincere respect for his father, and above all, a father irritated as you justly are by his faults.   Neither have I, sir, the slightest wish to pass for the most respectable member of my family.   I know that I have merited your reproaches, but I conjure you to temper them with mercy, and not to look upon me as the most infamous of mankind.   I do not deserve such harsh names.   It is love, you know it, that has caused all my errors.   Fatal passion!   Have you yourself never felt its force?   Is it possible that you, with the same blood in your veins that flows in mine, should have passed through life unscathed by the same excitements?   Love has rendered me perhaps foolishly tender--too easily excited-- too impassioned--too faithful, and probably too indulgent to the desires and caprices, or, if you will, the faults of an adored mistress.   These are my crimes; are they such as to reflect dishonour upon you?   Come, my dear father,' said I tenderly, `show some pity for a son, who has never ceased to feel respect and affection for you--who has not renounced, as you say, all feelings of honour and of duty, and who is himself a thousand times more an object of pity than you imagine.'

"L’indignation et la surprise me lièrent la langue. Elle répétait ses instances, et je cherchais des expressions pour les rejeter avec mépris.

"J’allai chez le gouverneur comme j’en étais convenu avec Manon, pour le prier de consentir à la cérémonie de notre mariage. Je me serais bien gardé d’en parler, à lui ni à personne, si j’eusse pu me promettre que son aumônier, qui était alors le seul prêtre de la ville, m’eût rendu ce service sans sa participation ; mais, n’osant espérer qu’il voulût s’engager au silence, j’avais pris le parti d’agir ouvertement. Le gouverneur avait un neveu, nommé Synnelet, qui lui était extrêmement cher. C’était un homme de trente ans, brave, mais emporté et violent. Il n’était point marié. La beauté de Manon l’avait touché dès le jour de notre arrivée ; et les occasions sans nombre qu’il avait eues de la voir, pendant neuf ou dix mois, avaient tellement enflammé sa passion, qu’il se consumait en secret pour elle. Cependant, comme il était persuadé, avec son oncle et toute la ville, que j’étais réellement marié, il s’était rendu maître de son amour jusqu’au point de n’en laisser rien éclater et son zèle s’était même déclaré pour moi, dans plusieurs occasions de me rendre service. Je le trouvai avec son oncle, lorsque j’arrivai au fort. Je n’avais nulle raison qui m’obligeât de lui faire un secret de mon dessein, de sorte que je ne fis point difficulté de m’expliquer en sa présence. Le gouverneur m’écouta avec sa bonté ordinaire. Je lui racontai une partie de mon histoire, qu’il entendit avec plaisir, et, lorsque je le priai d’assister à la cérémonie que je méditais, il eut la générosité de s’engager à faire toute la dépense de la fête. Je me retirai fort content.","I went to the governor as I had agreed with Manon, to beg him to consent to our marriage ceremony. I would have taken good care not to speak of it, to him or to anyone, if I had been able to promise myself that his chaplain, who was then the only priest in the town, would have done me this service without his participation; but, not daring to hope that he would commit himself to silence, I had made up my mind to act openly. The governor had a nephew, named Synnelet, who was extremely dear to him. He was a man of thirty, brave, but hot-tempered and violent. He was not married. Manon's beauty had touched him from the day we arrived; and the innumerable occasions he had had of seeing her, during nine or ten months, had so inflamed his passion that he secretly consumed himself for her. However, as he was convinced, with his uncle and the whole town, that I was really married, he had made himself master of his love to the point of not letting anything burst out of it and his zeal had even declared itself. for me, on many occasions of doing me a favor. I found him with his uncle when I arrived at the fort. I had no reason which obliged me to make a secret of my intention to him, so that I made no difficulty in explaining myself in his presence. The governor listened to me with his usual kindness. I told him part of my story, which he heard with pleasure, and when I begged him to attend the ceremony I was planning, he had the generosity to undertake to pay all the expense of the party. I retired very happy.","As I had agreed with Manon, I went to see the governor to ask his consent to the ceremony of our marriage. I would not have mentioned the matter to him or anybody else, if I could have been sure that his almoner, who was the only priest in the town, would have done me this service without his knowledge; but, not daring to hope that the almoner would promise to keep it a secret, I had elected to act openly. The governor had a nephew, named Synnelet, of whom he was very fond. He was a man of thirty, brave, but hot-tempered and passionate. He was unmarried. From the very day of our arrival Manon’s beauty had made an impression on him, and the numberless occasions he had had of seeing her for nine or ten months had so inflamed his passion that he was secretly pining away for her. But as he, like his uncle and everybody else in the town, was convinced that I was really married, he had conquered his love to the extent of keeping it unobserved, and had even shown his friendship for me by offering me his services on more than one occasion. When I reached the citadel I found him with his uncle. I saw no reason for keeping my intentions secret from him and made no difficulty about going into the matter in his presence. The governor heard me with his usual kindness. I told him part of our story, which he gladly listened to, and when I asked him to be present at the ceremony I had in mind he generously undertook to bear all the expense of the celebrations. I came away very pleased.","""I waited upon the governor, as I had settled with Manon, to procure his consent to the ceremony of our marriage.   I should have avoided speaking to him or to any other person upon the subject, if I had imagined that his chaplain, who was the only minister in the town, would have performed the office for me without his knowledge; but not daring to hope that he would do so privately , I determined to act ingenuously in the matter. ""The governor had a nephew named Synnelet, of whom he was particularly fond.   He was about thirty; brave, but of a headstrong and violent disposition.   He was not married.   Manon's beauty had struck him on the first day of our arrival; and the numberless opportunities he had of seeing her during the last nine or ten months, had so inflamed his passion, that he was absolutely pining for her in secret.   However, as he was convinced in common with his uncle and the whole colony that I was married, he put such a restraint upon his feelings, that they remained generally unnoticed; and he lost no opportunity of showing the most disinterested friendship for me. ""He happened to be with his uncle when I arrived at the government house.   I had no reason for keeping my intention a secret from him, so that I explained myself without hesitation in his presence.   The governor heard me with his usual kindness.   I related to him a part of my history, to which he listened with evident interest; and when I requested his presence at the intended ceremony, he was so generous as to say, that he must be permitted to defray the expenses of the succeeding entertainment.   I retired perfectly satisfied."
