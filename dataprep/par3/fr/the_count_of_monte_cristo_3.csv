Mon père, assis devant une grande ouverture, attachait un regard sombre sur les profondeurs de l’horizon, interrogeant chaque point noir qui apparaissait sur le lac, tandis que ma mère, à demi couchée près de lui, appuyait sa tête sur son épaule, et que, moi, je jouais à ses pieds, admirant, avec ces étonnements de l’enfance qui grandissent encore les objets, les escarpements du Pinde, qui se dressait à l’horizon, les châteaux de Janina, sortant blancs et anguleux des eaux bleues du lac, les touffes immenses de verdures noires, attachées comme des lichens aux rocs de la montagne, qui de loin semblaient des mousses, et qui de près sont des sapins gigantesques et des myrtes immenses.","“I could not say how long we remained like this: at that time I still did not know what time was; sometimes, but rarely, my father had my mother and I summoned to the terrace of the palace; those were my hours of pleasure, seeing in the underground only moaning shadows and the flaming spear of Selim. My father, seated in front of a large opening, stared gloomily at the depths of the horizon, questioning each black speck that appeared on the lake, while my mother, half lying beside him, leaned her head on his shoulder, and that I was playing at his feet, admiring, with those childish astonishments which still magnify objects, the escarpments of Pindus, which rose on the horizon, the castles of Janina, emerging white and angular from the waters blue of the lake, the immense tufts of black verdure, attached like lichens to the rocks of the mountain, which from a distance looked like mosses, and which up close were gigantic firs and immense myrtles.","‘I cannot say how long we remained thus.

Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selim's fiery lance.

J'aime les bons accueils, moi: ils épanouissent les visages, et ceux qui m'entourent me paraissent encore moins laids. Je suis douée de quelque esprit et d'une certaine sensibilité relative qui me permet de tirer de l'existence générale, pour la faire entrer dans la mienne, ce que j'y trouve de bon, comme fait le singe lorsqu'il casse la noix verte pour en tirer ce qu'elle contient. Je suis riche, car vous avez une des belles fortunes de France, car je suis votre fille unique, et vous n'êtes point tenace au degré où le sont les pères de la Porte-Saint-Martin et de la Gaîté, qui déshéritent leurs filles parce qu'elles ne veulent pas leur donner de petits-enfants.

Happy, on the contrary, because I ask you, what am I missing? The world finds me beautiful, it's something to be welcomed. I like good receptions: they brighten faces, and those around me seem even less ugly. I am endowed with some wit and a certain relative sensibility which allows me to draw from general existence, to bring it into mine, what I find good in it, as the monkey does when he breaks the green nut to extract what it contains. I am rich, because you have one of the finest fortunes in France, because I am your only daughter, and you are not tenacious to the degree to which the fathers of Porte-Saint-Martin and de la Gaîté are, who disinherit their daughters because they don't want to give them grandchildren.

So beautiful, witty, adorned with some talent as they say in comic operas, and rich! but that is happiness, sir! Why then do you call me unhappy?","‘Wretched?’ Eugénie repeated. ‘Did you say wretched, Monsieur? Not at all, I assure you, and the exclamation seems altogether too theatrical and pretentious.

I like to be received with a smile which is becoming to a face and which makes those around me appear less ugly than usual.

I am rich because you have one of the finest fortunes in France, I am your only child and you are not obstinate like the fathers in plays at the Porte Saint-Martin or the Gaîté,2 who disinherit their daughters because they refuse to give them grandchildren.

Happy, on the contrary, for what am I in want of! The world calls me beautiful. It is something to be well received. I like a favorable reception; it expands the countenance, and those around me do not then appear so ugly. I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all I meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents. I am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in France. I am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the Porte Saint-Martin and Gaiete, who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren.

Cette réponse connue, il avait accédé au désir manifesté par Albert d'être présenté à Haydée; une fois devant elle, il avait laissé l'entretien tomber sur la mort d'Ali, ne s'opposant pas au récit d'Haydée (mais ayant sans doute donné à la jeune fille dans les quelques mots romaïques qu'il avait prononcés des instructions qui n'avaient point permis à Morcerf de reconnaître son père); d'ailleurs n'avait-il pas prié Morcerf de ne pas prononcer le nom de son père devant Haydée? Enfin il avait mené Albert en Normandie au moment où il savait que le grand éclat devait se faire. Il n'y avait pas à en douter, tout cela était un calcul, et, sans aucun doute, Monte-Cristo s'entendait avec les ennemis de son père.","And then, each of the forgotten or unnoticed things became visible to his eyes or present to his memory. Monte-Cristo knew everything, since he had bought Ali-Pasha's daughter, and knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Janina. This answer known, he had acceded to the desire expressed by Albert to be presented to Haydée; once in front of her, he had let the interview fall on Ali's death, not opposing Haydée's story (but having no doubt given the young girl in the few romaic words he had spoken instructions which had not enabled Morcerf to recognize his father); besides, had he not asked Morcerf not to pronounce his father's name in front of Haydée? Finally he had taken Albert to Normandy just when he knew the big splash was about to happen. There was no doubt about it, it was all a calculation, and, without a doubt, Monte Cristo got along with his father's enemies.","Then, one by one, certain things that he had forgotten or failed to notice became visible to his eyes and present in his memory: Monte Cristo knew everything, since he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Janina. Once he knew the reply, he had granted Albert’s wish to be introduced to Haydée; and, once in her presence, he had allowed the conversation to turn to the death of Ali, not objecting to Haydée ’s story – but no doubt instructing the young woman, in the few words of Romaic that he spoke to her, not to allow Morcerf to recognize his father. Moreover, had he not requested Morcerf to avoid mentioning his father’s name in front of Haydée? Finally he had taken Albert to Normandy at the very moment when he knew that the scandal would break. There could no longer be any doubt: all this was part of a plot and, without any doubt, Monte Cristo was in collusion with his father’s enemies.","And, in addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert's wish to be introduced to Haidee, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Haidee's recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf's father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father's name before Haidee? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father's enemies."
