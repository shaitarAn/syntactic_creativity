"Swann était du reste aveugle, en ce qui concernait Odette, non seulement devant ces lacunes de son éducation, mais aussi devant la médiocrité de son intelligence. Bien plus, chaque fois qu’Odette racontait une histoire bête, Swann écoutait sa femme avec une complaisance, une gaieté, presque une admiration où il devait entrer des restes de volupté ; tandis que, dans la même conversation, ce que lui-même pouvait dire de fin, même de profond, était écouté par Odette, habituellement sans intérêt, assez vite, avec impatience et quelquefois contredit avec sévérité. Et on conclura que cet asservissement de l’élite à la vulgarité est de règle dans bien des ménages, si l’on pense, inversement, à tant de femmes supérieures qui se laissent charmer par un butor, censeur impitoyable de leurs plus délicates paroles, tandis qu’elles s’extasient, avec l’indulgence infinie de la tendresse, devant ses facéties les plus plates. Pour revenir aux raisons qui empêchèrent à cette époque Odette de pénétrer dans le faubourg Saint-Germain, il faut dire que le plus récent tour du kaléidoscope mondain avait été provoqué par une série de scandales. Des femmes chez qui on allait en toute confiance avaient été reconnues être des filles publiques, des espionnes anglaises. On allait pendant quelque temps demander aux gens, on le croyait du moins, d’être avant tout, bien posés, bien assis… Odette représentait exactement tout ce avec quoi on venait de rompre et d’ailleurs immédiatement de renouer (car les hommes, ne changeant pas du jour au lendemain, cherchent dans un nouveau régime la continuation de l’ancien, mais en le cherchant sous une forme différente qui permît d’être dupe et de croire que ce n’était plus la société d’avant la crise). Or, aux dames « brûlées » de cette société Odette ressemblait trop. Les gens du monde sont fort myopes ; au moment où ils cessent toutes relations avec des dames israélites qu’ils connaissaient, pendant qu’ils se demandent comment remplacer ce vide, ils aperçoivent, poussée là comme à la faveur d’une nuit d’orage, une dame nouvelle, israélite aussi ; mais grâce à sa nouveauté, elle n’est pas associée dans leur esprit, comme les précédentes, avec ce qu’ils croient devoir détester. Elle ne demande pas qu’on respecte son Dieu. On l’adopte. Il ne s’agissait pas d’antisémitisme à l’époque où je commençai d’aller chez Odette. Mais elle était pareille à ce qu’on voulait fuir pour un temps.","Swann was, moreover, blind, as far as Odette was concerned, not only to these shortcomings in her education, but also to the mediocrity of her intelligence. Moreover, each time that Odette told a stupid story, Swann listened to his wife with a complacency, a gaiety, almost an admiration into which there must have been traces of pleasure; while, in the same conversation, what he himself could say of end, even of profound, was listened to by Odette, usually without interest, rather quickly, impatiently and sometimes contradicted with severity. And we will conclude that this enslavement of the elite to vulgarity is the rule in many households, if we think, conversely, of so many superior women who allow themselves to be charmed by a bittern, pitiless censor of their most delicate words, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of tenderness, before his flatter antics. To return to the reasons which at that time prevented Odette from entering the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be said that the most recent turn of the social kaleidoscope had been provoked by a series of scandals. Women to whom one went in complete confidence had been recognized as prostitutes, English spies. We were going to ask people for a while, we thought so at least, to be above all, well posed, well seated... Odette represented exactly everything with which we had just broken and moreover immediately reconnected (because men, not changing overnight, seek in a new regime the continuation of the old, but by seeking it in a different form which allows one to be duped and to believe that it was no longer the society before the crisis ). However, to the “burnt” ladies of this society Odette resembled too much. People of the world are very myopic; at the moment when they cease all relations with Jewish ladies they knew, while they are wondering how to replace this void, they see, pushed there as if by the favor of a stormy night, a new lady, also an Israelite ; but thanks to its novelty, it is not associated in their minds, like the preceding ones, with what they believe they should hate. She does not ask that we respect her God. We adopt it. It wasn't about anti-Semitism when I started going to Odette's. But it was like what we wanted to flee for a while.","But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint–Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come expect people (so, at least, one supposed) to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once (for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old) but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short–sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti–semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid.","In any case, Swann was blind not only to the gaps in Odette’s education, but also to her poverty of mind. Indeed, when she told one of her silly stories, he would listen to her full of an obliging, cheerful, even admiring attentiveness, which could only be explained by his finding her still sexually arousing; whereas, in the same conversation, Odette’s inveterate way was to lend a perfunctory ear, bored or impatient, to anything subtle or even profound that he might say, to half-ignore and at times sharply contradict him. It must be supposed that, in many marriages, such subservience of the outstanding to the vulgar is the rule, for one need only think of the opposite case, that of the gifted wives who smilingly defer to their crass boor of a husband as he crushes their nicest conceits, then gush with loving indulgence at the inept buffoonery which he thinks is humour. Among the other reasons which at that time prevented Odette from being accepted in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be said that a series of scandals had lately caused another shift in the patterns of the social kaleidoscope. Certain women, with whom people had been mixing without suspecting anything untoward, turned out to be common prostitutes and English spies. For a while, it was going to be expected, or so it was believed, that the only acceptable people would be those who were of unimpeachable respectability. Odette stood for everything which had just been shunned, but which (as people do not change overnight, but seek to continue a former state of affairs in the guise of a new one) was soon going to be welcomed back with open arms, having slightly altered its forms, thus enabling society to fool itself into believing it was no longer the same as it had been before the scandal. However, at that time Odette bore too close a resemblance to society’s lately exposed ladies. The elegant are nothing if not short-sighted – at the very moment when, having ostracized all the Jewish ladies of their acquaintance, they are looking about for other ladies with whom to replace them, they suddenly notice a new-comer who turns up like an orphan in the storm, but who happens to be Jewish too; it is the novelty of her which prevents them from seeing in her what they had seen, but chosen to abhor, in her predecessors. She requires no one to have no other gods before hers; and she is adopted. In the days when I was making my first entry into the world of Mme Swann, though the problem was not anti-Semitism, she was of a kind with those who were to be kept at a distance, for a time."
"Il n’est peut-être rien qui donne plus l’impression de la réalité de ce qui nous est extérieur, que le changement de la position, par rapport à nous, d’une personne même insignifiante, avant que nous l’ayons connue, et après. J’étais le même homme qui avait pris à la fin de l’après-midi le petit chemin de fer de Balbec, je portais en moi la même âme. Mais dans cette âme, à l’endroit où, à six heures, il y avait avec l’impossibilité d’imaginer le directeur, le Palace, son personnel, une attente vague et craintive du moment où j’arriverais, se trouvaient maintenant les boutons extirpés dans la figure du directeur cosmopolite (en réalité naturalisé Monégasque, bien qu’il fût – comme il disait parce qu’il employait toujours des expressions qu’il croyait distinguées, sans s’apercevoir qu’elles étaient vicieuses – « d’originalité roumaine ») – son geste pour sonner le lift, le lift lui-même, toute une frise de personnages de guignol sortis de cette boîte de Pandore qu’était le Grand-Hôtel, indéniables, inamovibles, et, comme tout ce qui est réalisé, stérilisants. Mais du moins ce changement dans lequel je n’étais pas intervenu me prouvait qu’il s’était passé quelque chose d’extérieur à moi – si dénuée d’intérêt que cette chose fût en soi – et j’étais comme le voyageur qui, ayant eu le soleil devant lui en commençant une course, constate que les heures sont passées quand il le voit derrière lui. J’étais brisé par la fatigue, j’avais la fièvre ; je me serais bien couché, mais je n’avais rien de ce qu’il eût fallu pour cela. J’aurais voulu au moins m’étendre un instant sur le lit, mais à quoi bon puisque je n’aurais pu y faire trouver de repos à cet ensemble de sensations qui est pour chacun de nous son corps conscient, sinon son corps matériel, et puisque les objets inconnus qui l’encerclaient, en le forçant à mettre ses perceptions sur le pied permanent d’une défensive vigilante, auraient maintenu mes regards, mon ouïe, tous mes sens, dans une position aussi réduite et incommode (même si j’avais allongé mes jambes) que celle du cardinal La Balue dans la cage où il ne pouvait ni se tenir debout ni s’asseoir. C’est notre attention qui met des objets dans une chambre, et l’habitude qui les en retire, et nous y fait de la place. De la place, il n’y en avait pas pour moi dans ma chambre de Balbec (mienne de nom seulement), elle était pleine de choses qui, ne me connaissant pas, me rendirent le coup d’œil méfiant que je leur jetai et, sans tenir aucun compte de mon existence, témoignèrent que je dérangeais le train-train de la leur. La pendule – alors qu’à la maison je n’entendais la mienne que quelques secondes par semaine, seulement quand je sortais d’une profonde méditation – continua sans s’interrompre un instant à tenir dans une langue inconnue des propos qui devaient être désobligeants pour moi, car les grands rideaux violets l’écoutaient sans répondre, mais dans une attitude analogue à celle des gens qui haussent les épaules pour montrer que la vue d’un tiers les irrite. Ils donnaient à cette chambre si haute un caractère quasi historique qui eût pu la rendre appropriée à l’assassinat du duc de Guise, et plus tard à une visite de touristes conduits par un guide de l’agence Cook, mais nullement à mon sommeil. J’étais tourmenté par la présence de petites bibliothèques à vitrines, qui couraient le long des murs, mais surtout par une grande glace à pieds, arrêtée en travers de la pièce et avant le départ de laquelle je sentais qu’il n’y aurait pas pour moi de détente possible. Je levais à tout moment mes regards – que les objets de ma chambre de Paris ne gênaient pas plus que ne faisaient mes propres prunelles, car ils n’étaient plus que des annexes de mes organes, un agrandissement de moi-même – vers le plafond surélevé de ce belvédère situé au sommet de l’hôtel et que ma grand’mère avait choisi pour moi ; et, jusque dans cette région plus intime que celle où nous voyons et où nous entendons, dans cette région où nous éprouvons la qualité des odeurs, c’était presque à l’intérieur de mon moi que celle du vétiver venait pousser dans mes derniers retranchements son offensive, à laquelle j’opposais non sans fatigue la riposte inutile et incessante d’un reniflement alarmé. N’ayant plus d’univers, plus de chambre, plus de corps que menacé par les ennemis qui m’entouraient, qu’envahi jusque dans les os par la fièvre, j’étais seul, j’avais envie de mourir. Alors ma grand’mère entra ; et à l’expansion de mon cœur refoulé s’ouvrirent aussitôt des espaces infinis.","There is perhaps nothing which gives the impression of the reality of what is outside us more than the change of the position, in relation to us, of even an insignificant person, before we have known him. , and after. I was the same man who had taken the little Balbec railway at the end of the afternoon, I carried within me the same soul. But in that soul, where at six o'clock there was with impossibility of imagining the manager, the Palace, his staff, a vague and fearful expectation of when I would arrive, were now the pimples removed from the face of the cosmopolitan director (in reality a naturalized Monegasque, although he was – as he said because he always used expressions which he thought distinguished, without noticing that they were vicious – “of Romanian originality"") – his gesture to ring the lift, the lift itself, a whole frieze of puppet characters emerging from this Pandora's box that was the Grand-Hôtel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realized, sterilants. But at least this change in which I had not intervened proved to me that something external to me had happened – however uninteresting that thing was in itself – and I was like the traveler who , having had the sun in front of him when starting a race, finds that the hours have passed when he sees it behind him. I was broken with fatigue, I had a fever; I would have gone to bed, but I had nothing that would have been necessary for that. I would have liked to at least lie down for a moment on the bed, but what was the point since I could not have found rest there for this set of sensations which is for each of us his conscious body, if not his material body, and since the unknown objects which surrounded him, by forcing him to put his perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant defensive, would have kept my eyes, my hearing, all my senses, in such a reduced and inconvenient position (even if I I had stretched out my legs) than that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage where he could neither stand nor sit. It is our attention that puts objects in a room, and habit that takes them out, and makes room for us. There wasn't room for me in my room at Balbec (mine in name only), it was full of things which, not knowing me, gave me back the wary glance I gave them and , without taking any account of my existence, testified that I was disturbing the routine of theirs. The clock – whereas at home I only heard mine for a few seconds a week, only when I emerged from deep meditation – continued without a moment's interruption to make remarks in an unknown language which must have been derogatory. for me, because the big purple curtains listened to him without answering, but in an attitude analogous to that of people who shrug their shoulders to show that the sight of a third party irritates them. They gave this lofty room an almost historic character that might have made it appropriate for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and later for a visit by tourists led by a guide from the Cook agency, but in no way for my sleep. I was tormented by the presence of little bookcases with glass cases running along the walls, but above all by a large mirror on feet, stopped across the room and before the departure of which I felt there would be no no possible relaxation for me. I raised my gaze at all times – which the objects in my room in Paris did not bother any more than did my own eyes, for they were no more than appendages to my organs, an enlargement of myself – towards the ceiling. elevated from this belvedere situated at the top of the hotel and which my grandmother had chosen for me; and, even in this region more intimate than that where we see and where we hear, in this region where we experience the quality of odors, it was almost inside my self that that of the vetiver came to grow in my last entrenchments. his offensive, to which I opposed, not without fatigue, the useless and incessant retort of an alarmed sniffle. Having no more universe, no more bedroom, no more body than threatened by the enemies that surrounded me, than invaded to the bone by fever, I was alone, I wanted to die. Then my grandmother came in; and to the expansion of my repressed heart immediately opened up infinite spaces.","There is perhaps nothing that gives us so strong an impression of the reality of the external world as the difference in the positions, relative to ourselves, of even a quite unimportant person before we have met him and after. I was the same man who had taken, that afternoon, the little train from Balbec to the coast, I carried in my body the same consciousness But on that consciousness, in the place where, at six o'clock, there had been, with the impossibility of forming any idea of the manager, the Grand Hotel or its occupants, a vague and timorous impatience for the moment at which I should reach my destination, were to be found now the pustules excised from the face of the cosmopolitan manager (he was, as a matter of fact, a naturalised Monegasque, although—as he himself put it, for he was always using expressions which he thought distinguished without noticing that they were incorrect—'of Rumanian originality'), his action in ringing for the lift, the lift–boy himself, a whole frieze of puppet–show characters issuing from that Pandora's box which was the Grand Hotel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realised, sterilising. But at least this change, which I had done nothing to bring about, proved to me that something had happened which was external to myself—however devoid of interest that thing might be—and I was like a traveller who, having had the sun in his face when he started, concludes that he has been for so many hours on the road when he finds the sun behind him. I was half dead with exhaustion, I was burning with fever; I would gladly have gone to bed, but I had no night–things. I should have liked at least to lie down for a little while on the bed, but what good would that have done me, seeing that I should not have been able to find any rest there for that mass of sensations which is for each of us his sentient if not his material body, and that the unfamiliar objects which encircled that body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant and defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped and comfortless (even if I had stretched out my legs) as that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage in which he could neither stand nor sit. It is our noticing them that puts things in a room, our growing used to them that takes them away again and clears a space for us. Space there was none for me in my bedroom (mine in name only) at Balbec; it was full of things which did not know me, which flung back at me the distrustful look that I had cast at them, and, without taking any heed of my existence, shewed that I was interrupting the course of theirs. The clock—whereas at home I heard my clock tick only a few seconds in a week, when I was coming out of some profound meditation—continued without a moment's interruption to utter, in an unknown tongue, a series of observations which must have been most uncomplimentary to myself, for the violet curtains listened to them without replying, but in an attitude such as people adopt who shrug their shoulders to indicate that the sight of a third person irritates them. They gave to this room with its lofty ceiling a semi–historical character which might have made it a suitable place for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and afterwards for parties of tourists personally conducted by one of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son's guides, but for me to sleep in—no. I was tormented by the presence of some little bookcases with glass fronts which ran along the walls, but especially by a large mirror with feet which stood across one corner, for I felt that until it had left the room there would be no possibility of rest for me there. I kept raising my eyes—which the things in my room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyelids themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself—towards the fantastically high ceiling of this belvedere planted upon the summit of the hotel which my grandmother had chosen for me; and in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, almost in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of flowering grasses next launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up to it, not without tiring myself still further, with the futile incessant defence of an anxious sniffing. Having no world, no room, no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging round me, invaded to the very bones by fever, I was utterly alone; I longed to die. Then my grandmother came in, and to the expansion of my ebbing heart there opened at once an infinity of space.","To give us an impression of the realness of people and things external to us, even if they are insignificant, there are few comparisons more instructive than the change their disposition towards ourselves undergoes between the time before we know them and the time after. I was the same person who had taken the late afternoon train on the little branch-line to Balbec; the self in me was the same. But now inside that self, occupying the space which at six in the evening had been fraught with my inability to picture the manager, the Grand-Hôtel and its employees, as well as with a vague uneasy expectation of the moment of arrival, there were the erstwhile pimples on the face of the cosmopolitan manager (who was actually a naturalized Monegasque of, as he put it, ‘Rumanian originality’, being given to sprinkling his speech with malapropisms which he thought very distinguished), the gesture he had made to summon the ‘lift’, not to mention the ‘lift’ himself, a whole frieze of puppetlike characters out of the opened Pandora’s box of the Grand-Hôtel, undeniable, unremoveable and, like all things which have come to pass, sterilizing in their effect. But at least this change, which I had not brought about, proved that something external to myself had happened, however trite a thing it was in itself; and I was like a traveller who, having set out on his journey with the sun in front of him, realizes that hours must have passed because it is now behind him. Feeling exhausted and with a touch of fever, I would have been glad to go to bed; but all my bedtime things were missing. I would have liked at least to lie down for a moment on the bed: but that would have done me no good, since I would have been incapable of granting any rest to that bundle of sensations that the waking body, even the material body, is for each of us, and also because the unknown objects which surrounded it, by forcing it to keep its perceptions in a permanent state of defensive alertness, would have held my eyes and ears, all my senses, in a posture as cramped and uncomfortable, even if I had stretched out my legs, as the one Louis XI inflicted on Cardinal La Balue12 by having him locked in a cage which made it impossible either to sit or stand. As our attentiveness furnishes a room, so habit unfurnishes it, making space in it for us. In that room of mine at Balbec, ‘mine’ in name only, there was no space for me: it was crammed with things which did not know me, which glared my distrust of them back at me, noting my existence only to the extent of letting me know they resented me for disturbing theirs. Without let-up, in some unfamiliar tongue, the clock, which at home I would never have heard for more than a few seconds a week, on surfacing from a long reverie, went on making comments about me, which must have sounded offensive to the tall violet curtains, for they stood there without a word in a listening posture, looking like the sort of people who will shrug their shoulders to show they are irked by the mere sight of someone. They gave to that bedroom with its high ceiling an almost historical air: it was the perfect sort of place for the Duc de Guise to have been assassinated in,13 say, and for crocodiles of tourists to file through led by a guide from Cook ’s – but not for me to get some sleep. I was tormented by the presence of low glass-fronted bookcases which ran all round the walls, and especially by a tall cheval-glass which stood athwart a corner of the room and which I knew would have to be taken away if I was ever to enjoy any possibility of calm. Constantly glancing or staring upwards (activities which, in Paris, were as unhindered by the things in my room as by my eyes themselves, these things being nothing but accessories of my own organs, extensions of myself), I looked at the vast height of the ceiling in this belvedere stuck on the very top of the hotel, which my grandmother had selected for me; and in that part of me which is more private than those used for seeing and hearing, that part where one is aware of shades of smell, almost inside the self, an assault by vetiver threw me back on my deepest defences as I tried to repel it, in my tiredness, with a pointless, repeated and apprehensive sniffing. Deprived of my universe, evicted from my room, with my very tenancy of my body jeopardized by the enemies about me, infiltrated to the bone by fever, I was alone and wished I could die. It was then that my grandmother entered the room and, as my shrivelled heart expanded, broad vistas of hope opened to me."
La patronne qui ne connaissait pas l’opéra d’Halévy ignorait pourquoi j’avais pris l’habitude de dire : « Rachel quand du Seigneur ». Mais ne pas la comprendre n’a jamais fait trouver une plaisanterie moins drôle et c’est chaque fois en riant de tout son cœur qu’elle me disait :,"The boss, who did not know Halévy's opera, did not know why I had taken to saying: ""Rachel when from the Lord"". But not understanding her never made you find a less funny joke and it was each time laughing with all her heart that she said to me:","The mistress, who was not familiar with Halévy's opera, did not know why I always called the girl ""Rachel when from the Lord."" But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole–hearted laugh that she would say to me:","The madam, being unfamiliar with Halévy’s opera, had no idea why I had taken to calling the girl ‘Rachel, when of the Lord’. But an inability to understand a joke has never been an impediment to being amused by it, and she always greeted me with a great laugh and the words:"
"Nous étions sortis du petit bois et avions suivi un lacis de chemins assez peu fréquentés où Andrée se retrouvait fort bien. « Tenez, me dit-elle tout à coup, voici vos fameux Creuniers, et encore vous avez de la chance, juste par le temps, dans la lumière où Elstir les a peints. » Mais j’étais encore trop triste d’être tombé pendant le jeu du furet d’un tel faîte d’espérances. Aussi ne fût-ce pas avec le plaisir que j’aurais sans doute éprouvé que je pus distinguer tout d’un coup à mes pieds, tapies entre les roches où elles se protégeaient contre la chaleur, les Déesses marines qu’Elstir avait guettées et surprises, sous un sombre glacis aussi beau qu’eût été celui d’un Léonard, les merveilleuses Ombres abritées et furtives, agiles et silencieuses, prêtes, au premier remous de lumière, à se glisser sous la pierre, à se cacher dans un trou, et promptes, la menace du rayon passée, à revenir auprès de la roche ou de l’algue, sous le soleil émietteur des falaises et de l’Océan décoloré dont elles semblent veiller l’assoupissement, gardiennes immobiles et légères, laissant paraître à fleur d’eau leur corps gluant et le regard attentif de leurs yeux foncés.","We had come out of the little wood and had followed a maze of fairly unfrequented paths where Andrée found herself very well. ""Here,"" she said to me suddenly, ""here are your famous Creuniers, and again you are lucky, just by the weather, in the light in which Elstir painted them."" But I was still too sad to have fallen during the ferret game from such a pinnacle of hope. So it was not with the pleasure that I would doubtless have experienced that I could suddenly distinguish at my feet, crouched between the rocks where they protected themselves against the heat, the sea Goddesses whom Elstir had watched and surprised, under a dark glaze as beautiful as that of Leonardo, the marvelous shades, sheltered and furtive, agile and silent, ready, at the first swirl of light, to slip under the stone, to hide in a hole , and quick, the threat of the ray passed, to return to the rock or the seaweed, under the crumbling sun of the cliffs and the discolored Ocean whose drowsiness they seem to watch over, motionless and light guardians, letting appear to water flower their sticky body and the watchful gaze of their dark eyes.","We had left the little wood and had followed a network of overgrown paths through which Andrée managed to find her way with great skill. Suddenly, ""Look now,"" she said to me, ""there are your famous Creuniers, and, I say, you are in luck, it's just the time of day, and the light is the same as when Elstir painted them."" But I was still too wretched at having fallen, during the game of 'ferret,' from such a pinnacle of hopes. And so it was not with the pleasure which otherwise I should doubtless have felt that I caught sight, almost below my feet, crouching among the rocks, where they had gone for protection from the heat, of marine goddesses for whom Elstir had lain in wait and surprised them there, beneath a dark glaze as lovely as Leonardo would have painted, the marvellous Shadows, sheltered and furtive, nimble and voiceless, ready at the first glimmer of light to slip behind the stone, to hide in a cranny, and prompt, once the menacing ray had passed, to return to rock or seaweed beneath the sun that crumbled the cliffs and the colourless ocean, over whose slumbers they seemed to be watching, motionless lightfoot guardians letting appear on the water's surface their viscous bodies and the attentive gaze of their deep blue eyes.","By now we were out of the little wood and into a network of rather deserted lanes, which Andrée followed without difficulty. ‘Well, here we are! she said all at once. Here are Les Creuniers for you! And you’re in luck – the weather today and the light are just as in Elstir’s water-colour.’ But the game of ring-on-a-string had knocked my high hopes from under me and I was too sad to take the pleasure I might otherwise have enjoyed in suddenly coming upon the sea-divinities whom Elstir had watched for and taken by surprise : there they were, directly beneath me, crouching among the rocks for protection against the rays of the sun, under the glow of a dark glaze as beautiful as any used by Leonardo, those wonderful furtively sheltering Shadows, nimble and soundless, ready at the slightest feint of light to slip under their stones or hide in a hole, and just as ready, once the threat from the rays had passed, to slip out again and lie awake beside the rocks or the seaweed, watching over them as they drowse drenched in the light of the cliff-corroding sun and the faded ocean, unmoving, insubstantial guardians, showing on the surface of the water the viscid shimmer of their bodies and the vigilant dark of their eyes."
"Quand Mme Swann était retournée auprès de ses visites, nous l’entendions encore parler et rire, car même devant deux personnes et comme si elle avait eu à tenir tête à tous les « camarades », elle élevait la voix, lançait les mots, comme elle avait si souvent, dans le petit clan, entendu faire à la « patronne », dans les moments où celle-ci « dirigeait la conversation ». Les expressions que nous avons récemment empruntées aux autres étant celles, au moins pendant un temps, dont nous aimons le plus à nous servir, Mme Swann choisissait tantôt celles qu’elle avait apprises de gens distingués que son mari n’avait pu éviter de lui faire connaître (c’est d’eux qu’elle tenait le maniérisme qui consiste à supprimer l’article ou le pronom démonstratif devant un adjectif qualifiant une personne), tantôt de plus vulgaires (par exemple : « C’est un rien ! » mot favori d’une de ses amies) et cherchait à les placer dans toutes les histoires que, selon une habitude prise dans le « petit clan », elle aimait à raconter. Elle disait volontiers ensuite : « J’aime beaucoup cette histoire », « ah ! avouez, c’est une bien belle histoire ! » ; ce qui lui venait, par son mari, des Guermantes qu’elle ne connaissait pas.","When Mme Swann had returned to her visits, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even in front of two people and as if she had had to stand up to all the ""comrades"", she raised her voice, threw out the words, as she had so often, in the little clan, overheard the ""boss"" doing things when she ""directed the conversation."" The expressions which we have recently borrowed from others being those, at least for a time, which we like to use the most, Madame Swann sometimes chose those which she had learned from distinguished people whom her husband had been unable to avoid from him. make known (it is from them that she inherited the mannerism which consists of removing the article or the demonstrative pronoun before an adjective qualifying a person), sometimes more vulgar (for example: ""It's a nothing!"" favorite word of one of her friends) and tried to place them in all the stories that, according to a habit taken in the ""little clan"", she liked to tell. She would then gladly say: “I really like this story”, “ah! Admit it, it's a great story! » ; what came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes whom she did not know.","When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the 'good friends' at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the 'little clan' heard its 'Mistress' do, at the moments when she 'led the conversation.' The expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished people whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know (it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person's name), at another time others more plebeian (such as ""It's a mere nothing!"" the favourite expression of one of her friends), and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the 'little clan,' she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, ""I do love that story!"" or ""Do admit, it's a very good story!"" which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know. Mme.","When Mme Swann had gone back to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing; for even in the presence of only two people, as though commanding the attention of the full complement of ‘chums’, she raised her voice, she held forth, as she had so often seen the ‘Patronne’ do among the ‘little clan’ so as to ‘keep the conversation going’. The expressions which we have most recently borrowed being those we most like to use, at least for a time, Mme Swann sometimes chose the ones she had picked up from the few distinguished people whom her husband had not managed to avoid introducing to her (such as the mannerism of dropping the article or the demonstrative pronoun before an adjective describing a person), and sometimes more vulgar ones (for instance, ‘Isn’t it ducky!’, which one of her close friends was always saying); and these she tried to work into whatever stories she told, as was her wont since the days of the ‘little clan’. At the end of her stories, she would sometimes add, ‘I’m very fond of that story,’ or ‘Now, you must admit, that’s a lovely story!’, a habit which she had acquired, via her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know."
– Ah ! il faudra que je donne ce renseignement à certaine personne qui n’est pas femme à en faire fi.,– Ah! I will have to give this information to some person who is not a woman to ignore it.,"""Indeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.""","– Well, I really must pass on that information to a certain person.

"Le bonheur de connaître ces jeunes filles était-il donc irréalisable ? Certes ce n’eût pas été le premier de ce genre auquel j’eusse renoncé. Je n’avais qu’à me rappeler tant d’inconnues que, même à Balbec, la voiture s’éloignant à toute vitesse m’avait fait à jamais abandonner. Et même le plaisir que me donnait la petite bande, noble comme si elle était composée de vierges helléniques, venait de ce qu’elle avait quelque chose de la fuite des passantes sur la route. Cette fugacité des êtres qui ne sont pas connus de nous, qui nous forcent à démarrer de la vie habituelle où les femmes que nous fréquentons finissent par dévoiler leurs tares, nous met dans cet état de poursuite où rien n’arrête plus l’imagination. Or dépouiller d’elle nos plaisirs, c’est les réduire à eux-mêmes, à rien. Offertes chez une de ces entremetteuses que, par ailleurs, on a vu que je ne méprisais pas, retirées de l’élément qui leur donnait tant de nuances et de vague, ces jeunes filles m’eussent moins enchanté. Il faut que l’imagination, éveillée par l’incertitude de pouvoir atteindre son objet, crée un but qui nous cache l’autre, et en substituant au plaisir sensuel l’idée de pénétrer dans une vie, nous empêche de reconnaître ce plaisir, d’éprouver son goût véritable, de le restreindre à sa portée.","Was the happiness of knowing these young girls, then, unattainable? Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had given up. I had only to remember so many unknowns that, even at Balbec, the car speeding away had made me give up forever. And even the pleasure that the little band gave me, noble as if it were composed of Hellenic virgins, came from the fact that it had something of the flight of passers-by on the road. This transience of beings who are not known to us, who force us to start from the usual life where the women we meet end up revealing their flaws, puts us in this state of pursuit where nothing can stop the imagination. Now to strip our pleasures of it is to reduce them to themselves, to nothing. Offered by one of those go-betweens whom, moreover, we have seen that I did not despise, removed from the element which gave them so much nuance and vagueness, these young girls would have enchanted me less. It is necessary that the imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to reach its object, creates a goal which hides the other from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasure the idea of penetrating into a life, prevents us from recognizing this pleasure, to experience its true taste, to restrict it within its reach.","The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range.","Was the happiness of knowing these young girls really unattainable? It would certainly not have been the first happiness of that sort which I had abandoned all hope of ever enjoying. I needed only to think of all the unknown girls, even on the roads round Balbec, whom I had had to give up as the speeding carriage parted me from them for ever. Even the joy I derived from this little group, as noble as though composed of Hellenic virgins, had something in it akin to the feeling I got from those fleeting passers-by on the road. The transience of brief strangers who enter our life and force us out of the normality in which all the women we are used to will eventually reveal their blemishes, puts us into a state of readiness to pursue them, in which nothing inhibits the imagination. For a pleasure divested of imagination is a pleasure reduced to itself, to nothing. If they had been offered to me by a madam – in the sort of house which, as has been seen, I did not disdain – divorced from the element which lent them so many colours and such attractive imprecision, they would have been less enchanting. The imagination, aroused by the possibility that it will not achieve its aim, is obliged to mask it with another, and by replacing sensual pleasure with the idea of penetrating someone’s life, makes sure we neither recognize that pleasure, experience its true flavour nor restrict it to its dimension of mere pleasure."
"Je restais maintenant volontiers à table pendant qu’on desservait, et si ce n’était pas un moment où les jeunes filles de la petite bande pouvaient passer, ce n’était plus uniquement du côté de la mer que je regardais. Depuis que j’en avais vu dans des aquarelles d’Elstir, je cherchais à retrouver dans la réalité, j’aimais comme quelque chose de poétique, le geste interrompu des couteaux encore de travers, la rondeur bombée d’une serviette défaite où le soleil intercale un morceau de velours jaune, le verre à demi vidé qui montre mieux ainsi le noble évasement de ses formes, et au fond de son vitrage translucide et pareil à une condensation du jour, un reste de vin sombre, mais scintillant de lumières, le déplacement des volumes, la transmutation des liquides par l’éclairage, l’altération des prunes qui passent du vert au bleu et du bleu à l’or dans le compotier déjà à demi dépouillé, la promenade des chaises vieillottes qui deux fois par jour viennent s’installer autour de la nappe dressée sur la table ainsi que sur un autel où sont célébrées les fêtes de la gourmandise, et sur laquelle au fond des huîtres quelques gouttes d’eau lustrale restent comme dans de petits bénitiers de pierre ; j’essayais de trouver la beauté là où je ne m’étais jamais figuré qu’elle fût, dans les choses les plus usuelles, dans la vie profonde des « natures mortes ».","I now happily stayed at the table while we served, and if it was not a time when the young girls of the little band could pass, it was no longer only the side of the sea that I looked at. Since I had seen some in Elstir's watercolors, I had been trying to find in reality, I liked something poetic, the interrupted gesture of the knives still crooked, the rounded roundness of an undone napkin where the sun interposes a piece of yellow velvet, the half-emptied glass which thus better shows the noble flare of its forms, and at the bottom of its translucent glazing and similar to a condensation of the day, a remnant of dark wine, but scintillating with lights, the shifting of volumes, the transmutation of liquids by lighting, the alteration of plums which pass from green to blue and from blue to gold in the already half-stripped compote, the promenade of old-fashioned chairs which twice a day come and settle around the tablecloth set up on the table as well as on an altar where the feasts of gluttony are celebrated, and on which at the bottom of the oysters a few drops of lustral water remain as in small stone clams; I tried to find beauty where I had never imagined it to be, in the most everyday things, in the deep life of “still lifes”.","I would now gladly remain at the table while it was being cleared, and, if it was not a moment at which the girls of the little band might be passing, it was no longer solely towards the sea that I would turn my eyes. Since I had seen such things depicted in water–colours by Elstir, I sought to find again in reality, I cherished, as though for their poetic beauty, the broken gestures of the knives still lying across one another, the swollen convexity of a discarded napkin upon which the sun would patch a scrap of yellow velvet, the half–empty glass which thus shewed to greater advantage the noble sweep of its curved sides, and, in the heart of its translucent crystal, clear as frozen daylight, a dreg of wine, dusky but sparkling with reflected lights, the displacement of solid objects, the transmutation of liquids by the effect of light and shade, the shifting colour of the plums which passed from green to blue and from blue to golden yellow in the half–plundered dish, the chairs, like a group of old ladies, that came twice daily to take their places round the white cloth spread on the table as on an altar at which were celebrated the rites of the palate, where in the hollows of oyster–shells a few drops of lustral water had gathered as in tiny holy water stoups of stone; I tried to find beauty there where I had never imagined before that it could exist, in the most ordinary things, in the profundities of 'still life.'","At the end of lunch, I was inclined now to sit on as the tables were being cleared; and if it was not a moment at which the little gang of girls could be expected to pass, my eyes looked on things other than the sea. Since seeing such things in the water-colours of Elstir, I enjoyed noticing them in reality, glimpses of poetry as they seemed: knives lying askew in halted gestures; the bell-tent of a used napkin, within which the sun has secreted its yellow velvet; the half-emptied glass showing better the noble widening of its lines, the undrunk wine darkening it, but glinting with lights, inside the translucent glaze seemingly made from condensed daylight; volumes displaced, and liquids transmuted, by angles of illumination; the deterioration of the plums, green to blue, blue to gold, in the fruit dish already half plundered; the wandering of the old-fashioned chairs, which twice a day take their places again about the cloth draping the table as though it is an altar for the celebration of the sanctity of appetite, with a few drops of lustral water left in oyster-shells like little stone fonts; I tried to find beauty where I had never thought it might be found, in the most ordinary things, in the profound life of ‘still life’."
"Elle était généralement en tiers dans mes rendez-vous avec son amie. Cependant il y avait des jours où je devais voir Albertine seule, jours que j’attendais dans la fièvre, qui passaient sans rien m’apporter de décisif, sans avoir été ce jour capital dont je confiais immédiatement le rôle au jour suivant, qui ne le tiendrait pas davantage ; ainsi s’écroulaient l’un après l’autre, comme des vagues, ces sommets aussitôt remplacés par d’autres.","She was usually third in my dates with her friend. However, there were days when I was to see Albertine alone, days that I waited for feverishly, which passed without bringing me anything decisive, without having been that capital day whose role I immediately entrusted to the following day, which did not would not hold it any longer; thus fell one after another, like waves, these peaks immediately replaced by others.","She was generally present as a third party at my meetings with her friend. And yet there were days when I was to see Albertine by herself, days to which I looked forward with feverish impatience, which passed without bringing me any decisive result, without having, any of them , been that cardinal day whose part I immediately entrusted to the day that was to follow, which would prove no more apt to play it; thus there crumbled and collapsed, one after another, like waves of the sea, those peaks at once replaced by others.","She was usually present when Albertine and I were together. But there were other times when I was due to see Albertine without her, each of which I looked forward to in a fever of expectation, then looked back on with the knowledge that it had brought about nothing of significance, that it had not been the great day I had hoped for, a hope I immediately transferred to the next one, which would not live up to it either; and so, one after the other, like waves, these pinnacles of promise rose, then broke, and were replaced by others."
"– Vous croyez vraiment ? me répondit-il. Eh bien, écoutez, si, tout de même, cela doit être cela que vous aimez le mieux, moi, je me le figure, voilà ce que je crois.","– Do you really think so? he replied. Well, listen, if, all the same, that must be what you like best, I imagine it, that's what I believe.","""You really think not?"" he replied. "" Well, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best , I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.""","– Really, is that so? he replied. No, look, honestly, you must be fond of them! Bound to be! I suspect you really are.’"
"– Maintenant que les Trombert sont soumis, les tribus voisines ne tarderont pas à se rendre.","“Now that the Tromberts are subjugated, the neighboring tribes will soon surrender.","Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial expedition, Mamma went on to observe: ""Now that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.","‘Now that the Tromberts are subdued, the neighbouring tribes will not hold out much longer.’"
"– Je saurais être raisonnable si tu partais pour quelques jours, mais je compterais les heures.","“I could be reasonable if you were leaving for a few days, but I would count the hours.","""I could manage to be sensible if you went away for a few days, but I should count the hours.""","Well, I might be if you went away for a few days.

"– Comment, mais c’est pour rien, c’est donné. On m’avait dit trois fois autant.","– How, but it’s for nothing, it’s given. I was told three times as much.","Why, that's nothing; it's given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.""",– Three! But that’s giving it away! I was told the figure was three times as high.
"Malheureusement, ce mécontentement que me causaient le projet de séance photographique et surtout la satisfaction que ma grand’mère paraissait en ressentir, je le laissai suffisamment apercevoir pour que Françoise le remarquât et s’empressât involontairement de l’accroître en me tenant un discours sentimental et attendri auquel je ne voulus pas avoir l’air d’adhérer.","Unfortunately, this dissatisfaction caused me by the project of a photographic session and above all the satisfaction that my grandmother seemed to feel about it, I allowed it to be seen enough for Françoise to notice it and involuntarily hasten to increase it by giving me a sentimental speech. and tenderness to which I did not want to appear to adhere.","Unfortunately, this displeasure that I derived from the prospect of a photographic 'sitting,' and more particularly from the satisfaction with which my grandmother appeared to be looking forward to it, I made so apparent that Françoise remarked it and did her best, unintentionally, to increase it by making me a sentimental, gushing speech, by which I refused to appear moved.","I was ill-advised enough, in Françoise’s presence, to show something of my disgruntlement at the intended photography session, and at the gratification that my grandmother seemed to derive from it; and Françoise, having noticed this, unintentionally aggravated my mood by making a sentimental and lachrymose remark, which I greeted with an expression calculated to dissociate myself from it."
"Mme de Villeparisis nous prévint que bientôt elle ne pourrait nous voir aussi souvent. Un jeune neveu qui préparait Saumur, actuellement en garnison dans le voisinage, à Doncières, devait venir passer auprès d’elle un congé de quelques semaines et elle lui donnerait beaucoup de son temps. Au cours de nos promenades, elle nous avait vanté sa grande intelligence, surtout son bon cœur ; déjà je me figurais qu’il allait se prendre de sympathie pour moi, que je serais son ami préféré et quand, avant son arrivée, sa tante laissa entendre à ma grand’mère qu’il était malheureusement tombé dans les griffes d’une mauvaise femme dont il était fou et qui ne le lâcherait pas, comme j’étais persuadé que ce genre d’amour finissait fatalement par l’aliénation mentale, le crime et le suicide, pensant au temps si court qui était réservé à notre amitié, déjà si grande dans mon cœur sans que je l’eusse encore vu, je pleurai sur elle et sur les malheurs qui l’attendaient comme sur un être cher dont on vient de nous apprendre qu’il est gravement atteint et que ses jours sont comptés.","Madame de Villeparisis told us that soon she would not be able to see us so often. A young nephew who was preparing Saumur, currently in garrison in the neighborhood, in Doncières, was to come and spend a few weeks' leave with her and she would give him a lot of her time. During our walks, she had boasted to us of her great intelligence, especially her good heart; I was already imagining that he was going to take a liking to me, that I would be his favorite friend, and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of a bad woman he was crazy about and who would not let go of him, as I was convinced that this kind of love inevitably ended in insanity, crime and suicide, thinking of the short time reserved for our friendship, already so big in my heart without my having seen her yet, I wept over her and over the misfortunes that awaited her as over a loved one who we have just been told is seriously ill and whose days are numbered.","Mme. de Villeparisis gave us warning that presently she would not be able to see so much of us. A young nephew who was preparing for Saumur, and was meanwhile stationed in the neighbourhood, at Doncières, was coming to spend a few weeks' furlough with her, and she would be devoting most of her time to him. In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered.","Mme de Villeparisis informed us that she would soon not be able to see so much of us: a young nephew of hers who was preparing for entry to the cavalry school at Saumur, and who was garrisoned nearby at Doncières,37 was coming to spend a few weeks’ holiday with her, and she would have to devote much of her time to him. On some of our drives together, she had spoken very warmly of his high intelligence and especially his kind heart, and I had been imagining how he would take a liking to me, how I would become his favourite friend; then, when his aunt hinted to my grandmother, before his arrival, that he had had the misfortune to fall madly in love with some impossible woman who now had him in her clutches and would not let him go, as I was convinced that love affairs of that sort could only lead to mental derangement, crime and suicide, the thought of how little time was left for our friendship, which was already so strong in my heart although I had not set eyes on him, moved me to tears for the misfortunes which must attend it, as though it was some beloved companion who one learns is seriously ill and not expected to live long."
"À cause de la violence de mes battements de cœur on me fit diminuer la caféine, ils cessèrent. Alors je me demandai si ce n’était pas un peu à elle qu’était due cette angoisse que j’avais éprouvée quand je m’étais à peu près brouillé avec Gilberte, et que j’avais attribuée chaque fois qu’elle se renouvelait à la souffrance de ne plus voir mon amie, ou de risquer de ne la voir qu’en proie à la même mauvaise humeur. Mais si ce médicament avait été à l’origine des souffrances que mon imagination eût alors faussement interprétées (ce qui n’aurait rien d’extraordinaire, les plus cruelles peines morales ayant souvent pour cause chez les amants, l’habitude physique de la femme avec qui ils vivent), c’était à la façon du philtre qui longtemps après avoir été absorbé continue à lier Tristan à Yseult. Car l’amélioration physique que la diminution de la caféine amena presque immédiatement chez moi n’arrêta pas l’évolution de chagrin que l’absorption du toxique avait peut-être sinon créé, du moins su rendre plus aigu.","Because of the violence of my heartbeat I was made to reduce the caffeine, they stopped. So I wondered if it wasn't a little to her that was due this anguish I had felt when I had more or less fallen out with Gilberte, and which I had attributed each time it happened again. to the suffering of not seeing my friend any more, or of risking seeing her only in the prey of the same bad mood. But if this medicine had been at the origin of the sufferings which my imagination would then have falsely interpreted (which would not be extraordinary, the most cruel moral penalties often having as their cause in lovers, the physical habit of women with whom they live), it was like the potion which, long after being absorbed, continues to bind Tristan to Yseult. For the physical improvement that the reduction in caffeine brought about almost immediately in me did not stop the evolution of grief that the absorption of the toxic had perhaps if not created, at least been able to make more acute.","In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill–humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly (not that there would be anything extraordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living), it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps—if it had not created it—at any rate contrived to render more acute.","My heart palpitations had become so violent that I was ordered to reduce my consumption of caffeine. This having put a stop to them, I began to wonder whether the caffeine might not be partly responsible for the anguish I had felt when I more or less chose to fall out with Gilberte, and which I had attributed, each time it recurred, to the grief of separation from her, or the likelihood of being with her only when she was still in the same bad mood. But if this medication was really the source of a suffering that had then been misinterpreted by my imagination (which would not be unheard-of, as the most acute emotional pain suffered by a lover often comes from his sheer physical habituation to the woman he loves), then its action was like that of the love-potion which, long after Tristan and Yseult have drunk it, continues to bind them. For the physical improvement brought about almost at once by the reduction in caffeine did not inhibit the evolution of the sorrow which the toxic dose had possibly created, or which it had at least contrived to make more acute."
"Je me convainquis que je n’étais pas cruel de me moquer de la sensibilité de Françoise, en me rappelant que ma mère et ma grand’mère, mes modèles en tout, le faisaient souvent aussi. Mais ma grand’mère, s’apercevant que j’avais l’air ennuyé, me dit que si cette séance de pose pouvait me contrarier elle y renoncerait. Je ne le voulus pas, je l’assurai que je n’y voyais aucun inconvénient et la laissai se faire belle, mais je crus faire preuve de pénétration et de force en lui disant quelques paroles ironiques et blessantes destinées à neutraliser le plaisir qu’elle semblait trouver à être photographiée, de sorte que si je fus contraint de voir le magnifique chapeau de ma grand’mère, je réussis du moins à faire disparaître de son visage cette expression joyeuse qui aurait dû me rendre heureux et qui, comme il arrive trop souvent tant que sont encore en vie les êtres que nous aimons le mieux, nous apparaît comme la manifestation exaspérante d’un travers mesquin plutôt que comme la forme précieuse du bonheur que nous voudrions tant leur procurer. Ma mauvaise humeur venait surtout de ce que cette semaine-là ma grand’mère avait paru me fuir, et que je n’avais pu l’avoir un instant à moi, pas plus le jour que le soir. Quand je rentrais dans l’après-midi pour être un peu seul avec elle, on me disait qu’elle n’était pas là ; ou bien elle s’enfermait avec Françoise pour de longs conciliabules qu’il ne m’était pas permis de troubler. Et quand ayant passé la soirée dehors avec Saint-Loup je songeais pendant le trajet du retour au moment où j’allais pouvoir retrouver et embrasser ma grand’mère, j’avais beau attendre qu’elle frappât contre la cloison ces petits coups qui me diraient d’entrer lui dire bonsoir, je n’entendais rien ; je finissais par me coucher, lui en voulant un peu de ce qu’elle me privât, avec une indifférence si nouvelle de sa part, d’une joie sur laquelle j’avais compté tant, je restais encore, le cœur palpitant comme dans mon enfance, à écouter le mur qui restait muet et je m’endormais dans les larmes.","I convinced myself that it was not cruel to make fun of Françoise's sensibility, remembering that my mother and my grandmother, my role models in everything, often did it too. But my grandmother, realizing that I looked bored, told me that if this posing session could upset me, she would give it up. I didn't want to, I assured her that I saw no inconvenience and let her make herself beautiful, but I thought I was showing penetration and strength by saying a few ironic and hurtful words to her intended to neutralize the pleasure that she seemed to be photographed, so that if I was forced to see my grandmother's magnificent hat, I at least succeeded in erasing from her face that joyous expression which should have made me happy and which, as it happens too often, while the beings we love best are still alive, appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of a petty flaw rather than as the precious form of happiness that we would so much like to procure for them. My bad humor was due above all to the fact that that week my grandmother had seemed to avoid me, and that I had not been able to have her for a moment to myself, any more during the day than in the evening. When I came home in the afternoon to be a little alone with her, I was told that she was not there; or else she shut herself up with Françoise for long confabulations which I was not permitted to disturb. And when, having spent the evening outside with Saint-Loup, I dreamed during the return trip of the moment when I was going to be able to find and kiss my grandmother, I waited in vain for her to knock against the partition those little knocks that would say to come in and say good evening, I couldn't hear a thing; I ended up going to bed, resenting her a little for depriving me, with such new indifference on her part, of a joy on which I had counted so much. childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent and I fell asleep in tears.","I acquired the conviction that I was not cruel in laughing at Françoise's sensibility, by reminding myself that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did the same. But my grandmother, noticing that I seemed cross, said that if this plan of her sitting for her photograph offended me in any way she would give it up. I would not let her; I assured her that I saw no harm in it, and left her to adorn herself, but, thinking that I shewed my penetration and strength of mind , I added a few stinging words of sarcasm, intended to neutralise the pleasure which she seemed to find in being photographed, so that if I was obliged to see my grandmother's magnificent hat, I succeeded at least in driving from her face that joyful expression which ought to have made me glad; but alas, it too often happens, while the people we love best are still alive, that such expressions appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of some unworthy freak of fancy rather than as the precious form of the happiness which we should dearly like to procure for them. My ill–humour arose more particularly from the fact that, during the last week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me, and I had not been able to have her to myself for a moment, either by night or day. When I came back in the afternoon to be alone with her for a little I was told that she was not in the hotel; or else she would shut herself up with Françoise for endless confabulations which I was not permitted to interrupt. And when, after being out all evening with Saint– Loup, I had been thinking on the way home of the moment at which I should be able to go to my grandmother and to kiss her, in vain might I wait for her to knock on the partition between us the three little taps which would tell me to go in and say good night to her; I heard nothing; at length I would go to bed, a little resentful of her for depriving me, with an indifference so new and strange in her, of a joy on which I had so much counted, I would lie still for a while, my heart throbbing as in my childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent, until I cried myself to sleep.","I told myself it was not unkind to scorn Françoise’s mode of sensibility, with the reminder that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did so. But my grandmother, noticing that I looked put out, said that, if the taking of the photograph was bothersome to me, she would not go ahead with it. I did not want her to abandon the idea, told her I had no objection and let her titivate herself. But I thought it was pretty clever and superior of me to say a few hurtful and sarcastic words to her, so as to neutralize the pleasure she seemed to look forward to from being photographed; and, though I was obliged to see her magnificent hat, at least I managed to banish from her face the signs of a joy which I ought to have been happy to share with her, but which, as so often happens while those whom we love best are still alive, can strike us as a mere irritant, a mark of something silly and small-minded, rather than the precious revelation of the happiness we long to give to them. My bad mood was mainly the result of the fact that, throughout that week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me and that I had been unable to have a moment with her, either during the day or in the evenings. When I went back to the hotel in the afternoons, so as to have a little time with her, I was told she was not in; or else she was closeted with Françoise, having long confabulations which I was supposed not to interrupt. Or if I had been out all evening with Saint-Loup, and came back to the hotel enjoying the prospect of being with her again and giving her a kiss, I would wait in vain for her little knocks on the wall, which were her invitation to me to go in and kiss her goodnight; I would get into bed, a little resentful at this unfamiliar indifference in her, at her way of depriving me of a pleasure which I had been much looking forward to; and with my heart throbbing as much as it had ever done when I was a child, I would lie there listening to the silence of the wall, until sleep came to dry my tears."

"Tant que je m’étais contenté d’apercevoir du fond de mon lit de Paris l’église persane de Balbec au milieu des flocons de la tempête, aucune objection à ce voyage n’avait été faite par mon corps. Elles avaient commencé seulement quand il avait compris qu’il serait de la partie et que le soir de l’arrivée on me conduirait à « ma » chambre qui lui serait inconnue. Sa révolte était d’autant plus profonde que la veille même du départ j’avais appris que ma mère ne nous accompagnerait pas, mon père, retenu au ministère jusqu’au moment où il partirait pour l’Espagne avec M. de Norpois, ayant préféré louer une maison dans les environs de Paris. D’ailleurs la contemplation de Balbec ne me semblait pas moins désirable parce qu’il fallait l’acheter au prix d’un mal qui au contraire me semblait figurer et garantir la réalité de l’impression que j’allais chercher, impression que n’aurait remplacée aucun spectacle prétendu équivalent, aucun « panorama » que j’eusse pu aller voir sans être empêché par cela même de rentrer dormir dans mon lit. Ce n’était pas la première fois que je sentais que ceux qui aiment et ceux qui ont du plaisir ne sont pas les mêmes. Je croyais désirer aussi profondément Balbec que le docteur qui me soignait et qui me dit, s’étonnant, le matin du départ, de mon air malheureux : « Je vous réponds que si je pouvais seulement trouver huit jours pour aller prendre le frais au bord de la mer, je ne me ferais pas prier. Vous allez avoir les courses, les régates, ce sera exquis. » Pour moi j’avais déjà appris et même bien avant d’aller entendre la Berma, que quelle que fût la chose que j’aimerais, elle ne serait jamais placée qu’au terme d’une poursuite douloureuse au cours de laquelle il me faudrait d’abord sacrifier mon plaisir à ce bien suprême, au lieu de l’y chercher.","As long as I had contented myself with glimpsing from the depths of my bed in Paris the Persian church of Balbec amid the flakes of the storm, no objection to this trip had been made by my body. They had started only when he understood that he would be there and that on the evening of his arrival I would be taken to ""my"" room, which would be unknown to him. His revolt was all the more profound since the very day before we left I had learned that my mother would not be accompanying us, my father, who had been kept at the ministry until he left for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to rent a house near Paris. Besides, the contemplation of Balbec did not seem to me less desirable because it had to be bought at the price of an evil which, on the contrary, seemed to me to represent and guarantee the reality of the impression that I was going to seek, an impression that I would have replaced any supposedly equivalent spectacle, any ""panorama"" that I could have gone to see without being prevented by that very reason from going back to sleep in my bed. It was not the first time that I felt that those who love and those who have fun are not the same. I thought I wanted Balbec as deeply as the doctor who was treating me and who said to me, surprised, the morning of departure, by my unhappy air: ""I answer you that if I could only find a week to cool off of the sea, I would not be asked to pray. You are going to have the races, the regattas, it will be exquisite. For me, I had already learned, and even long before going to hear Berma, that whatever thing I wanted, it would never be placed until the end of a painful pursuit during which I I would first have to sacrifice my pleasure to this supreme good, instead of seeking it there.","So long as I had been content to look out from the warmth of my own bed in Paris at the Persian church of Balbec, shrouded in driving sleet, no sort of objection to this journey had been offered by my body. Its objections began only when it had gathered that it would have itself to take part in the journey, and that on the evening of my arrival I should be shewn to 'my' room which to my body would be unknown. Its revolt was all the more deep–rooted in that on the very eve of my departure I learned that my mother would not be coming with us, my father, who would be kept busy at the Ministry until it was time for him to start for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to take a house in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the other hand, the spectacle of Balbec seemed to me none the less desirable because I must purchase it at the price of a discomfort which, on the contrary, I felt to indicate and to guarantee the reality of the impression which I was going there to seek, an impression the place of which no spectacle of professedly equal value, no 'panorama' which I might have gone to see without being thereby precluded from returning home to sleep in my own bed, could possibly have filled. It was not for the first time that I felt that those who love and those who find pleasure are not always the same. I believed myself to be longing fully as much for Balbec as the doctor who was treating me, when he said to me, surprised, on the morning of our departure, to see me look so unhappy, ""I don't mind telling you that if I could only manage a week to go down and get a blow by the sea, I shouldn't wait to be asked twice. You'll be having races, regattas; you don't know what all!"" But I had already learned the lesson—long before I was taken to hear Berma— that, whatever it might be that I loved, it would never be attained save at the end of a long and heart–rending pursuit, in the course of which I should have first to sacrifice my own pleasure to that paramount good instead of seeking it there.","As long as I had been content to lie in my snug bed in Paris and see Balbec’s Persian church buffeted by blizzard and storm, my body had raised no objection to this journey. Objections only began once my body realized it was to be included and that on the evening of our arrival I would be shown to ‘my’ room, which would be completely unfamiliar to it. Its disagreement with this was especially acute since I had learned only on the eve of our departure that my mother was not to accompany us; my father, who was unable to get away from the Ministry until the date set for his visit to Spain with M. de Norpois, had decided to rent a house at Saint-Cloud on the outskirts of Paris. Not that to be able to gaze upon Balbec seemed less desirable because it could only be enjoyed at the cost of pain to myself. On the contrary, it was this pain which seemed to embody and guarantee the reality of the impression which I sought; and that impression could never have been replaced by some other supposedly equivalent sight, such as a ‘fine view’ which I might have been able to go and see without its preventing me from going home at bed-time. Not for the first time I sensed that those who know love and those who enjoy life are not the same people. I was sure my desire to go to Balbec was as strong as my doctor’s when he said, on the very morning of our departure, surprised as he was by my unhappy expression, ‘Believe you me, if I could just take a single week off, to enjoy the sea-air, you wouldn’t have to ask me twice! Just think: there’ll be the races and the regattas – it will be lovely!’ Long before going to see La Berma, however, I had learned that whatever I longed for would be mine only at the end of a painful pursuit; and that this supreme goal could be achieved only on condition that I sacrifice to it the pleasure I had hoped to find in it."

"– Il porte le titre de baron de Charlus. Régulièrement, quand mon grand-oncle est mort, mon oncle Palamède aurait dû prendre le titre de prince des Laumes, qui était celui de son frère avant qu’il devînt duc de Guermantes, car dans cette famille-là ils changent de nom comme de chemise. Mais mon oncle a sur tout cela des idées particulières. Et comme il trouve qu’on abuse un peu des duchés italiens, grandesses espagnoles, etc., et bien qu’il eût le choix entre quatre ou cinq titres de prince, il a gardé celui de baron de Charlus, par protestation et avec une apparente simplicité où il y a beaucoup d’orgueil. « Aujourd’hui, dit-il, tout le monde est prince, il faut pourtant bien avoir quelque chose qui vous distingue ; je prendrai un titre de prince quand je voudrai voyager incognito. » Il n’y a pas selon lui de titre plus ancien que celui de baron de Charlus ; pour vous prouver qu’il est antérieur à celui des Montmorency, qui se disaient faussement les premiers barons de France, alors qu’ils l’étaient seulement de l’Île-de-France, où était leur fief, mon oncle vous donnera des explications pendant des heures et avec plaisir parce que, quoiqu’il soit très fin, très doué, il trouve cela un sujet de conversation tout à fait vivant, dit Saint-Loup avec un sourire. Mais comme je ne suis pas comme lui, vous n’allez pas me faire parler généalogie, je ne sais rien de plus assommant, de plus périmé, vraiment l’existence est trop courte.","– He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Regularly, when my great-uncle died, my uncle Palamède should have taken the title of Prince of Laumes, which was that of his brother before he became Duke of Guermantes, because in that family they change their name as well as their shirt. But my uncle has special ideas about all this. And as he finds that the Italian duchies, Spanish greatnesses, etc., are a little abused, and although he had the choice between four or five titles of prince, he kept that of baron de Charlus, by protest and with a apparent simplicity where there is much pride. “Today,” he said, “everyone is a prince, yet you must have something that distinguishes you; I will take a title of prince when I want to travel incognito. According to him, there is no title older than that of Baron de Charlus; To prove to you that it predates that of the Montmorencys, who falsely called themselves the first barons of France, when they were only of the Ile-de-France, where their fief was, my uncle will give you explanations for hours and with pleasure because, although he is very shrewd, very gifted, he finds it a very lively topic of conversation, said Saint-Loup with a smile. But since I'm not like him, you're not going to make me talk about genealogy, I don't know anything more boring, more outdated, really life is too short.","""He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Properly speaking, when my great–uncle died, my uncle Palamède ought to have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which his brother used before he became Duc de Guermantes, for in that family they change their names as you'd change your shirt. But my uncle has peculiar ideas about all that sort of thing. And as he feels that people are rather apt to overdo the Italian Prince and Grandee of Spain business nowadays, though he had half–a–dozen titles of 'Prince' to choose from, he has remained Baron de Charlus, as a protest, and with an apparent simplicity which really covers a good deal of pride. ' In these days,' he says, 'everybody is Prince something–or–other; one really must have a title that will distinguish one; I shall call myself Prince when I wish to travel incognito.' According to him there is no older title than the Charlus barony; to prove to you that it is earlier than the Montmorency title, though they used to claim, quite wrongly, to be the premier barons of France when they were only premier in the He de France, where their fief was, my uncle will explain to you for hours on end and enjoy doing it, because, although he's a most intelligent man, really gifted, he regards that sort of thing as quite a live topic of conversation,"" Saint–Loup smiled again. "" But as I am not like him, you mustn't ask me to talk pedigrees; I know nothing more deadly, more perishing; really, life is not long enough.""","– He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Strictly speaking, at the death of my great-uncle, my uncle Palamède should have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which was his brother’s before he in his turn became the Duc de Guermantes – the people in my family change their titles the way other people change their shirt. However, my uncle has his own way of thinking on such things: he takes the view that there are rather too many Italian duchies and Spanish grandees and the like, and so, though he could have chosen any one of four or five titles which would have made him Prince of This or That, he remained plain Baron de Charlus, as a sort of protest, but with a lot of pride concealed under the apparent simplicity of it. “Nowadays,” he says, “when every Tom, Dick or Harry is a prince, one requires something else with which to differentiate onself. I’ll keep my ‘Prince’ for when I’m travelling incognito.” According to him, there’s no title as ancient as Baron de Charlus: if he undertakes to prove to you that it’s older than the titles of the Montmorency family, who falsely claim to be the first Barons of France, when all they were was Barons of Île-de-France,55 because that’s where their feudal lands were, he’ll take a delight in inundating you, submerging you with facts and figures about it. It must be said that, although he’s very clever, very gifted, he thinks that’s a brilliant topic of conversation, Saint-Loup said with a smile. But I’m not like him and you’re not going to get me to talk for hours about genealogies – life is too short to spend it prattling about boring out-of-date nonsense like that.’"
"Peut-être avait-elle obscurément senti que mon jeu avait un autre objet que celui que j’avais avoué, mais n’avait-elle pas su remarquer que je l’avais atteint. Et moi qui craignais qu’elle s’en fût aperçue (et un certain mouvement rétractile et contenu de pudeur offensée qu’elle eut un instant après, me donna à penser que je n’avais pas eu tort de le craindre), j’acceptai de lutter encore, de peur qu’elle pût croire que je ne m’étais proposé d’autre but que celui après quoi je n’avais plus envie que de rester tranquille auprès d’elle.","Perhaps she had vaguely sensed that my game had another object than the one I had confessed to, but had failed to notice that I had achieved it.

"On peut penser que l’apparition soudaine, sous les traits d’une petite vieille, de la plus puissante des fées ne m’aurait pas causé plus de plaisir, dénué comme j’étais de tout recours pour m’approcher de Mlle de Stermaria, dans un pays où je ne connaissais personne. J’entends personne au point de vue pratique. Esthétiquement, le nombre des types humains est trop restreint pour qu’on n’ait pas bien souvent, dans quelque endroit qu’on aille, la joie de revoir des gens de connaissance, même sans les chercher dans les tableaux des vieux maîtres, comme faisait Swann. C’est ainsi que dès les premiers jours de notre séjour à Balbec, il m’était arrivé de rencontrer Legrandin, le concierge de Swann, et Mme Swann elle-même, devenus, le premier, garçon de café, le second un étranger de passage que je ne revis pas, et la dernière un maître baigneur. Et une sorte d’aimantation attire et retient si inséparablement les uns auprès les autres certains caractères de physionomie et de mentalité que quand la nature introduit ainsi une personne dans un nouveau corps elle ne la mutile pas trop. Legrandin changé en garçon de café gardait intacts sa stature, le profil de son nez et une partie du menton ; Mme Swann dans le sexe masculin et la condition de maître baigneur avait été suivie non seulement par sa physionomie habituelle, mais même par une certaine manière de parler. Seulement elle ne pouvait pas m’être de plus d’utilité entourée de sa ceinture rouge et hissant, à la moindre houle, le drapeau qui interdit les bains, car les maîtres baigneurs sont prudents, sachant rarement nager, qu’elle ne l’eût pu dans la fresque de la Vie de Moïse où Swann l’avait reconnue jadis sous les traits de la fille de Jethro. Tandis que cette Mme de Villeparisis était bien la véritable, elle n’avait pas été victime d’un enchantement qui l’eût dépouillée de sa puissance, mais était capable au contraire d’en mettre un à la disposition de la mienne qu’il centuplerait, et grâce auquel, comme si j’avais été porté par les ailes d’un oiseau fabuleux, j’allais franchir en quelques instants les distances sociales infinies, au moins à Balbec, qui me séparaient de Mlle de Stermaria.","One can think that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a little old woman, of the most powerful of the fairies would not have given me more pleasure, devoid as I was of any recourse to approach Mlle de Stermaria. , in a country where I did not know anyone. I hear nobody from a practical point of view. Aesthetically, the number of human types is too limited for us not to have very often, wherever we go, the joy of seeing people we know again, even without looking for them in the paintings of the old masters, such as said Swann. It was thus that from the first days of our stay at Balbec, I happened to meet Legrandin, Swann's concierge, and Madame Swann herself, who had become, the first, a waiter, the second a stranger to passage that I did not see again, and the last a lifeguard. And a sort of magnetism so inseparably attracts and retains together certain characteristics of physiognomy and mentality that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him too much. Legrandin, transformed into a waiter, kept intact his stature, the profile of his nose and part of his chin; Madame Swann in the male sex and the condition of master bather had been followed not only by her usual physiognomy, but even by a certain way of speaking. Only she could not be of more use to me surrounded by her red belt and hoisting, at the slightest swell, the flag which prohibits baths, for the master bathers are cautious, rarely knowing how to swim, than she does. might have been in the fresco of the Life of Moses, where Swann had once recognized her as the daughter of Jethro. While this Madame de Villeparisis was indeed the real one, she had not been the victim of an enchantment that would have stripped her of her power, but was on the contrary capable of placing one at the disposal of mine that he would increase a hundredfold, and thanks to which, as if I had been carried by the wings of a fabulous bird, I was going to cross in a few moments the infinite social distances, at least at Balbec, which separated me from Mademoiselle de Stermaria.","It may be imagined that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a. little old woman, of the most powerful of fairies would not have given me so much pleasure, destitute as I was of any means of access to Mlle. de Stermaria, in a strange place where I knew no one: no one, that is to say, for any practical purpose. Aesthetically the number of types of humanity is so restricted that we must constantly, wherever we may be, have the pleasure of seeing people we know, even without looking for them in the works of the old masters, like Swann. Thus it happened that in the first few days of our visit to Balbec I had succeeded in finding Legrandin, Swann's hall porter and Mme. Swann herself, transformed into a waiter, a foreign visitor whom I never saw again and a bathing superintendent. And a sort of magnetism attracts and retains so inseparably, one after another, certain characteristics, facial and mental, that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him unduly. Legrandin turned waiter kept intact his stature, the outline of his nose, part of his chin; Mme. Swann, in the masculine gender and the calling of a bathing superintendent, had been accompanied not only by familiar features, but even by the way she had of speaking. Only, she could be of little if any more use to me, standing upon the beach there in the red sash of her office, and hoisting at the first gust of wind the flag which forbade us to bathe (for these superintendents are prudent men, and seldom know how to swim) than she would have been in that fresco of the Life of Moses in which Swann had long ago identified her in the portrait of Jethro's Daughter. Whereas this Mme. de Villeparisis was her real self, she had not been the victim of an enchantment which had deprived her of her power, but was capable, on the contrary, of putting at the service of my power an enchantment which would multiply it an hundredfold, and thanks to which, as though I had been swept through the air on the wings of a fabulous bird, I was to cross in a few moments the infinitely wide (at least, at Balbec) social gulf which separated me from Mlle. de Stermaria.","The sudden appearance, in the guise of a little old lady, of the most influential of fairy godmothers could not have caused me greater pleasure, devoid as I was of any device to bring myself closer to Mlle de Stermaria in a place where I knew no one. No one, I mean, of any practical assistance. The aesthetic range available to the human countenance being so narrow, one frequently has the pleasure, wherever one may be, of meeting faces known to one, without needing to seek them out, as Swann did, in the paintings of old masters. So it was that, in the very first days of our stay at Balbec, I had happened upon first Legrandin, then Swann’s concierge and finally Mme Swann herself, turned into a waiter in a café, a visiting foreigner whom I never set eyes on again and a bathing monitor. There is a sort of magnetism which brings together, and keeps together, certain features of physiognomy and mentality, so that when Nature fits such a person into a different body, it does so without much mutilation. Though transformed into a waiter, Legrandin had kept his stature, the line of his nose and a part of his chin; Mme Swann, though she had undergone a sex-change and was a bathing monitor, had retained her usual facial features and even something of her own ways of speaking. However, even with her red belt and waving her flag to warn swimmers out of the water at the slightest swell (bathing monitors being cautious creatures, so few of them being themselves swimmers), she was of no more help to me in the present circumstances than she would have been in the Life of Moses fresco, where Swann had once noticed her disguised as Jethro’s daughter. Mme de Villeparisis, however, was there in person; not only had no spell stripped her of her power, but she could actually cast a spell on my power, greatly increasing it and enabling me in an instant, as though on the wings of some fabled bird, to sweep over the infinite social distance – infinite in Balbec at least – separating me from Mlle de Stermaria."

But as soon as we entered the living room of a fairly distant cousin who had the right reason to come first that her home was not ours, my mother was horrified when she saw, her candied or disguised chestnuts in her hand, the best friend of the most susceptible of my uncles to whom he was going to report that we had not begun our tour with him. This uncle would surely be hurt; he would have thought it only natural for us to go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes where he lived before stopping at Saint-Augustin, to set off again on rue de l'École-de-Médecine.","When New Year's Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand (with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father) according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing–room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint–Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l'Ecole de Médecine.","When New Year’s Day came round, my first occupation was to accompany Mama on visits to family. So as not to tire me, she had my father map out an itinerary for us; and she arranged our calls according to which part of town our relatives lived in, rather than in any order of family precedence. But we had hardly set foot in the drawing-room of a rather distant cousin – the lack of distance to her house being the reason why she was first on the list – when my mother was horrified to see, among the bringers of seasonal offerings of marrons glacés and marrons déguisés, the best friend of the touchiest of my uncles, who would therefore be informed that we had seen fit to make our first visit of the morning to someone other than himself. My uncle would be sure to be offended, as he would no doubt have taken it for granted that we should go all the way down from the Madeleine to his house near the Jardin des Plantes, then come all the way back to Saint-Augustin before crossing the river again to go to the rue de l’École-de-Médecine."
"Quelle déception j’éprouvai les jours suivants quand, chaque fois que je le rencontrai dehors ou dans l’hôtel – le col haut, équilibrant perpétuellement les mouvements de ses membres autour de son monocle fugitif et dansant qui semblait leur centre de gravité – je pus me rendre compte qu’il ne cherchait pas à se rapprocher de nous et vis qu’il ne nous saluait pas quoiqu’il ne pût ignorer que nous étions les amis de sa tante. Et me rappelant l’amabilité que m’avaient témoignée Mme de Villeparisis et avant elle M. de Norpois, je pensais que peut-être ils n’étaient que des nobles pour rire et qu’un article secret des lois qui gouvernent l’aristocratie doit y permettre peut-être aux femmes et à certains diplomates de manquer dans leurs rapports avec les roturiers, et pour une raison qui m’échappait, à la morgue que devait au contraire pratiquer impitoyablement un jeune marquis. Mon intelligence aurait pu me dire le contraire. Mais la caractéristique de l’âge ridicule que je traversais – âge nullement ingrat, très fécond – est qu’on n’y consulte pas l’intelligence et que les moindres attributs des êtres semblent faire partie indivisible de leur personnalité. Tout entouré de monstres et de dieux, on ne connaît guère le calme. Il n’y a presque pas un des gestes qu’on a faits alors qu’on ne voudrait plus tard pouvoir abolir. Mais ce qu’on devrait regretter au contraire c’est de ne plus posséder la spontanéité qui nous les faisait accomplir. Plus tard on voit les choses d’une façon plus pratique, en pleine conformité avec le reste de la société, mais l’adolescence est le seul temps où l’on ait appris quelque chose.","What a disappointment I felt in the days that followed when, each time I met him outside or in the hotel – his collar high, balancing the movements of his limbs perpetually around his fleeting, dancing monocle which seemed to be their center of gravity – I could I realized that he wasn't trying to get closer to us and saw that he wasn't greeting us, although he couldn't ignore that we were his aunt's friends. And remembering the kindness that Mme de Villeparisis and before her M. de Norpois had shown me, I thought that perhaps they were only nobles for fun and a secret article of the laws which govern the aristocracy. must perhaps allow women and certain diplomats to lack in their relations with the commoners, and for some reason that escaped me, the arrogance that a young marquis had to practice on the contrary. My intelligence could have told me otherwise. But the characteristic of the ridiculous age that I was going through – an age that was by no means ungrateful, very fertile – is that the intelligence is not consulted there and that the slightest attributes of beings seem to be an indivisible part of their personality. All surrounded by monsters and gods, one hardly knows calm. There is hardly one of the gestures that we have made when we would later not want to be able to abolish. But what we should regret, on the contrary, is that we no longer possess the spontaneity that made us accomplish them. Later we see things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but adolescence is the only time when we have learned something.","What a disappointment was mine on the days that followed, when, each time that I met him outside or in the hotel—his head erect, perpetually balancing the movements of his limbs round the fugitive and dancing monocle which seemed to be their centre of gravity—I was forced to admit that he had evidently no desire to make our acquaintance, and saw that he did not bow to us although he must have known that we were friends of his aunt. And calling to mind the friendliness that Mme. de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had shewn me, I thought that perhaps they were only of a bogus nobility, and that there might be a secret section in the laws that govern the aristocracy which allowed women, perhaps, and certain diplomats to discard, in their relations with plebeians, for a reason which was beyond me, the stiffness which must, on the other hand, be pitilessly maintained by a young Marquis. My intelligence might have told me the opposite. But the characteristic feature of the silly phase through which I was passing—a phase by no means irresponsive, indeed highly fertile—is that we do not consult our intelligence and that the most trivial attributes of other people seem to us then to form an inseparable part of their personality. In a world thronged with monsters and with gods, we are barely conscious of tranquillity. There is hardly one of the actions which we performed in that phase which we would not give anything, in later life, to be able to erase from our memory. Whereas what we ought to regret is that we no longer possess the spontaneity which made us perform them. In later life we look at things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but youth was the only time in which we learned anything.","What a disappointment it was for me, on each of the days following, whenever our paths crossed outside or inside the hotel, he with his high collar, and keeping his limbs in perpetual equilibrium about the dancing flight of his monocle, which seemed to be their centre of gravity, to realize that it was not his intention to make our acquaintance, that he never once greeted us, although he could not be unaware we were friends with his aunt! When I remembered how polite Mme de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had been towards me, I wondered whether they might not be mere mock nobility, whether there might not be some secret provision in the code of laws governing the aristocracy which perhaps, for some reason unknown to me, permitted women or the odd diplomat who might have dealings with commoners not to treat them with the sweeping disdain which a merciless young marquis must show. Reason could have contradicted this. But the salient feature of the absurd age I was at – an age which, for all its alleged awkwardness, is prodigiously rich – is that reason is not its guide, and the most insignificant attributes of other people always appear to be consubstantial with their personality. One lives among monsters and gods, a stranger to peace of mind. There is scarcely a single one of our acts from that time which we would not prefer to abolish later on. But all we should lament is the loss of the spontaneity which urged them upon us. In later life, we see things with a more practical eye, one we share with the rest of society; but adolescence was the only time when we ever learned anything."

"À midi et demi, je me décidais enfin à entrer dans cette maison qui, comme un gros soulier de Noël, me semblait devoir m’apporter de surnaturels plaisirs. (Le nom de Noël était du reste inconnu à Mme Swann et à Gilberte qui l’avaient remplacé par celui de Christmas, et ne parlaient que du pudding de Christmas, de ce qu’on leur avait donné pour leur Christmas, de s’absenter – ce qui me rendait fou de douleur – pour Christmas. Même à la maison, je me serais cru déshonoré en parlant de Noël et je ne disais plus que Christmas, ce que mon père trouvait extrêmement ridicule.)","At half past twelve, I finally decided to enter this house which, like a big Christmas shoe, seemed to me to bring me supernatural pleasures. (Noel's name was, moreover, unknown to Madame Swann and Gilberte, who had replaced it with that of Christmas, and spoke only of Christmas's pudding, of what they had been given for their Christmas, of being absent - which drove me mad with grief - for Christmas. Even at home I would have felt dishonored by talking about Christmas and would only say Christmas, which my father found extremely ridiculous.)","At half–past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. (The French name 'Noël' was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English 'Christmas,' and would speak of nothing but 'Christmas pudding,' what people had given them as 'Christmas presents' and of going away—the thought of which maddened me with grief—'for Christmas.' At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word 'Noël,' and always said 'Christmas,' which my father considered extremely silly.)","By half-past twelve, I would have plucked up the courage to enter the house which, like a great Christmas stocking, seemed to promise supernatural delights. The French word Noël, by the way, was never heard from the lips of Mme Swann or Gilberte. They had replaced it by the English word and spoke of le pudding de Christmas, of the présents de Christmas which they had been given, of going away (which gave me an unbearable pang) pour Christmas. At home, it would have been beneath my dignity to speak of Noël; and I went about talking of le Christmas, in the teeth of my father’s ridicule."
"Malheureusement ces lieux merveilleux que sont les gares, d’où l’on part pour une destination éloignée, sont aussi des lieux tragiques, car si le miracle s’y accomplit grâce auquel les pays qui n’avaient encore d’existence que dans notre pensée vont être ceux au milieu desquels nous vivrons, pour cette raison même il faut renoncer au sortir de la salle d’attente à retrouver tout à l’heure la chambre familière où l’on était il y a un instant encore. Il faut laisser toute espérance de rentrer coucher chez soi, une fois qu’on s’est décidé à pénétrer dans l’antre empesté par où l’on accède au mystère, dans un de ces grands ateliers vitrés, comme celui de Saint-Lazare où j’allais chercher le train de Balbec, et qui déployait au-dessus de la ville éventrée un de ces immenses ciels crus et gros de menaces amoncelées de drame, pareils à certains ciels, d’une modernité presque parisienne, de Mantegna ou de Véronèse, et sous lequel ne pouvait s’accomplir que quelque acte terrible et solennel comme un départ en chemin de fer ou l’érection de la Croix.","Unfortunately, these marvelous places which are the stations, from which one leaves for a distant destination, are also tragic places, because if the miracle is accomplished there thanks to which the countries which still had no existence except in our thought are going to be those in the midst of which we will live, for this very reason we must give up leaving the waiting room to find later the familiar room where we were still a moment ago. You have to give up all hope of going back to sleep at home, once you have decided to enter the pestilent lair through which you gain access to the mystery, in one of those large glass studios, like that of Saint-Lazare. where I was going to fetch the train from Balbec, and which unfurled above the gutted city one of those immense crude skies heavy with threats heaped up with drama, like certain skies, of an almost Parisian modernity, of Mantegna or Veronese, and under which could only be accomplished some terrible and solemn act like a departure by train or the erection of the Cross.","Unhappily those marvellous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote destination, are tragic places also, for if in them the miracle is accomplished whereby scenes which hitherto have had no existence save in our minds are to become the scenes among which we shall be living, for that very reason we must, as we emerge from the waiting–room, abandon any thought of finding ourself once again within the familiar walls which, but a moment ago, were still enclosing us. We must lay aside all hope of going home to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into one of those vast, glass–roofed sheds, like that of Saint–Lazare into which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the city one of those bleak and boundless skies, heavy with an accumulation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the Cross.","Sad to say, those wonderful places, railway-stations, our starting-point for a distant destination, are also tragic places, for though they are the setting for the miracle which will turn a land hitherto non-existent except in the mind into one we are going to live in, for that very reason, as soon as we venture outside the waiting-room, we must abandon all hope of returning to the familiar bedroom which we left only a moment before. We have to give up all prospect of sleeping at home tonight, as soon as we have decided to venture into the reeking cavern which is the necessary anteroom to mystery, one of those huge glass-roofed machine-shops, such as the Gare Saint-Lazare, which was where I had to seek out the train for Balbec and which, above the great chasm slitting the city, had spread out one of those vast bleak skies, dense with portents of pent-up tragedy, resembling certain skies of Mantegna’s and Veronese’s, fraught with their quasi-Parisian modernity, an apt backdrop to the most awesome or hideous of acts, such as the Crucifixion or a departure by train."

"Si, au moment de quitter Mme Swann quand son « thé » finissait, je pensais à ce que j’allais écrire à sa fille, Mme Cottard elle, en s’en allant, avait eu des pensées d’un caractère tout différent. Faisant sa « petite inspection », elle n’avait pas manqué de féliciter Mme Swann sur les meubles nouveaux, les récentes « acquisitions » remarquées dans le salon. Elle pouvait d’ailleurs y retrouver, quoique en bien petit nombre, quelques-uns des objets qu’Odette avait autrefois dans l’hôtel de la rue Lapérouse, notamment ses animaux en matières précieuses, ses fétiches.","If, at the moment of leaving Madame Swann when her ""tea"" was over, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Madame Cottard, on leaving, had had thoughts of an entirely different character. Making her ""little inspection"", she had not failed to congratulate Madame Swann on the new furniture, the recent ""acquisitions"" noticed in the living room. She could also find there, albeit in very small numbers, some of the objects that Odette once had in the hotel on rue Lapérouse, in particular her animals made of precious materials, her fetishes.","If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea–party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little 'tour of inspection' she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new 'pieces,' the recent 'acquisitions' which caught the eye in her drawing–room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La Pérouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes.","My thoughts, as I left Mme Swann’s at the end of her tea-time, were all for what I was going to say in my letter to her daughter; but Mme Cottard’s thoughts were full of something very different. As she carried out her little ‘tour of inspection’, she had made a point of congratulating Mme Swann on any new piece of furniture or any recent ‘acquisition’ she had noticed in the drawing-room. Among them she might also have noticed a meagre remnant of the things Odette had once surrounded herself with in the rue La Pérouse house, especially the animals in precious stones and metals, her fetishes."
"C’est aussi en détournant les yeux que je traversai le jardin qui avait une pelouse – en plus petit comme chez n’importe quel bourgeois dans la banlieue de Paris – une petite statuette de galant jardinier, des boules de verre où l’on se regardait, des bordures de bégonias et une petite tonnelle sous laquelle des rocking-chairs étaient allongés devant une table de fer. Mais après tous ces abords empreints de laideur citadine, je ne fis plus attention aux moulures chocolat des plinthes quand je fus dans l’atelier ; je me sentis parfaitement heureux, car par toutes les études qui étaient autour de moi, je sentais la possibilité de m’élever à une connaissance poétique, féconde en joies, de maintes formes que je n’avais pas isolées jusque-là du spectacle total de la réalité. Et l’atelier d’Elstir m’apparut comme le laboratoire d’une sorte de nouvelle création du monde, où, du chaos que sont toutes choses que nous voyons, il avait tiré, en les peignant sur divers rectangles de toile qui étaient posés dans tous les sens, ici une vague de la mer écrasant avec colère sur le sable son écume lilas, là un jeune homme en coutil blanc accoudé sur le pont d’un bateau. Le veston du jeune homme et la vague éclaboussante avaient pris une dignité nouvelle du fait qu’ils continuaient à être, encore que dépourvus de ce en quoi ils passaient pour consister, la vague ne pouvant plus mouiller, ni le veston habiller personne.","It was also looking away that I crossed the garden which had a lawn – smaller as in any bourgeois in the suburbs of Paris – a small statuette of a gallant gardener, glass balls where we watched, borders of begonias and a small arbor under which rocking chairs were stretched out in front of an iron table. But after all these surroundings imbued with urban ugliness, I no longer paid attention to the chocolate moldings of the baseboards when I was in the workshop; I felt perfectly happy, because through all the studies that were around me, I felt the possibility of raising myself to a poetic knowledge, fruitful in joys, of many forms that I had not isolated until then from the total spectacle. reality. And Elstir's studio seemed to me like the laboratory of a kind of new creation of the world, where, from the chaos that is all things that we see, he had drawn, painting them on various rectangles of canvas which were placed in all directions, here a wave of the sea angrily crushing its lilac foam on the sand, there a young man in white drill leaning on the deck of a boat. The young man's jacket and the splashing wave had taken on a new dignity from the fact that they continued to be, though devoid of what they were thought to consist of, the wave no longer being able to wet, nor the jacket to clothe anyone.","It was also with averted eyes that I crossed the garden, which had a lawn—in miniature, like any little suburban villa round Paris—a statuette of an amorous gardener, glass balls in which one saw one's distorted reflexion, beds of begonias and a little arbour, beneath which rocking chairs were drawn up round an iron table. But after all these preliminaries hallmarked with philistine ugliness, I took no notice of the chocolate mouldings on the plinths once I was in the studio; I felt perfectly happy, for, with the help of all the sketches and studies that surrounded me, I foresaw the possibility of raising myself to a poetical understanding, rich in delights, of many forms which I had not, hitherto, isolated from the general spectacle of reality. And Elstir's studio appeared to me as the laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world in which, from the chaos that is all the things we see, he had extracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas that were hung everywhere about the room, here a wave of the sea crushing angrily on the sand its lilac foam, there a young man in a suit of white linen, leaning upon the rail of a vessel. His jacket and the spattering wave had acquired fresh dignity from the fact that they continued to exist, even although they were deprived of those qualities in which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able to splash nor the jacket to clothe anyone.","As I walked through the garden, I kept my eyes averted also from the lawn – smaller than, but reminiscent of, that of any middle-class philistine in the suburbs of Paris – the statuette of a lovelorn gardener, glass balls for looking at one’s reflection, borders of begonias and a little arbour with rocking-chairs set out round a metal table. After all these approaches full of citified ugliness, once in the studio itself, I paid no attention to the chocolate-coloured mouldings on its skirting-boards: I was perfectly happy among all the studies ranged about, for I glimpsed in them the possibility that I might rise to a poetic awareness, rich in fulfilling insights for me, of many forms which I had hitherto never distinguished in reality’s composite spectacle. Elstir’s studio seemed like the laboratory out of which would come a kind of new creation of the world: from the chaos made of all things we see, he had abstracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas now standing about on all sides, glimpses of things, like a wave in the sea crashing its angry lilac-shaded foam down on the sand, or a young man in white twill leaning on a ship’s rail. The young man’s jacket and the splash of the wave had taken on a new dignity, in virtue of the fact that they continued to exist, though now deprived of what they were believed to consist in, the wave being now unable to wet anyone, and the jacket unable to be worn."
"Je serrai les dix mille francs. Mais ils ne me servaient plus à rien. Je les dépensai du reste encore plus vite que si j’eusse envoyé tous les jours des fleurs à Gilberte, car quand le soir venait, j’étais si malheureux que je ne pouvais rester chez moi et allais pleurer dans les bras de femmes que je n’aimais pas. Quant à chercher à faire un plaisir quelconque à Gilberte, je ne le souhaitais plus ; maintenant retourner dans la maison de Gilberte n’eût pu que me faire souffrir. Même revoir Gilberte qui m’eût été si délicieux la veille ne m’eût plus suffi. Car j’aurais été inquiet tout le temps où je n’aurais pas été près d’elle. C’est ce qui fait qu’une femme par toute nouvelle souffrance qu’elle nous inflige, souvent sans le savoir, augmente son pouvoir sur nous, mais aussi nos exigences envers elle. Par ce mal qu’elle nous a fait, la femme nous cerne de plus en plus, redouble nos chaînes, mais aussi celles dont il nous aurait jusque-là semblé suffisant de la garrotter pour que nous nous sentions tranquilles. La veille encore, si je n’avais pas cru ennuyer Gilberte, je me serais contenté de réclamer de rares entrevues, lesquelles maintenant ne m’eussent plus contenté et que j’eusse remplacées par bien d’autres conditions. Car en amour, au contraire de ce qui se passe après les combats, on les fait plus dures, on ne cesse de les aggraver, plus on est vaincu, si toutefois on est en situation de les imposer. Ce n’était pas mon cas à l’égard de Gilberte. Aussi je préférai d’abord ne pas retourner chez sa mère. Je continuais bien à me dire que Gilberte ne m’aimait pas, que je le savais depuis assez longtemps, que je pouvais la revoir si je voulais, et, si je ne le voulais pas, l’oublier à la longue. Mais ces idées, comme un remède qui n’agit pas contre certaines affections, étaient sans aucune espèce de pouvoir efficace contre ces deux lignes parallèles que je revoyais de temps à autre, de Gilberte et du jeune homme s’enfonçant à petits pas dans l’avenue des Champs-Élysées. C’était un mal nouveau, qui lui aussi finirait par s’user, c’était une image qui un jour se présenterait à mon esprit entièrement décantée de tout ce qu’elle contenait de nocif, comme ces poisons mortels qu’on manie sans danger, comme un peu de dynamite à quoi on peut allumer sa cigarette sans crainte d’explosion. En attendant, il y avait en moi une autre force qui luttait de toute sa puissance contre cette force malsaine qui me représentait sans changement la promenade de Gilberte dans le crépuscule et qui, pour briser les assauts renouvelés de ma mémoire, travaillait utilement en sens inverse mon imagination. La première de ces deux forces, certes, continuait à me montrer ces deux promeneurs de l’avenue des Champs-Élysées, et m’offrait d’autres images désagréables, tirées du passé, par exemple Gilberte haussant les épaules quand sa mère lui demandait de rester avec moi. Mais la seconde force, travaillant sur le canevas de mes espérances, dessinait un avenir bien plus complaisamment développé que ce pauvre passé en somme si restreint. Pour une minute où je revoyais Gilberte maussade, combien n’y en avait-il pas où je combinais une démarche qu’elle ferait faire pour notre réconciliation, pour nos fiançailles peut-être. Il est vrai que cette force que l’imagination dirigeait vers l’avenir, elle la puisait malgré tout dans le passé. Au fur et à mesure que s’effacerait mon ennui que Gilberte eût haussé les épaules, diminuerait aussi le souvenir de son charme, souvenir qui me faisait souhaiter qu’elle revînt vers moi. Mais j’étais encore bien loin de cette mort du passé. J’aimais toujours celle qu’il est vrai que je croyais détester. Mais chaque fois qu’on me trouvait bien coiffé, ayant bonne mine, j’aurais voulu qu’elle fût là. J’étais irrité du désir que beaucoup de gens manifestèrent à cette époque de me recevoir et chez lesquels je refusai d’aller. Il y eut une scène à la maison parce que je n’accompagnai pas mon père à un dîner officiel où il devait y avoir les Bontemps avec leur nièce Albertine, petite jeune fille, presque encore enfant. Les différentes périodes de notre vie se chevauchent ainsi l’une l’autre. On refuse dédaigneusement, à cause de ce qu’on aime et qui vous sera un jour si égal, de voir ce qui vous est égal aujourd’hui, qu’on aimera demain, qu’on aurait peut-être pu, si on avait consenti à le voir, aimer plus tôt, et qui eût ainsi abrégé vos souffrances actuelles, pour les remplacer, il est vrai, par d’autres. Les miennes allaient se modifiant. J’avais l’étonnement d’apercevoir au fond de moi-même, un jour un sentiment, le jour suivant un autre, généralement inspirés par telle espérance ou telle crainte relatives à Gilberte, à la Gilberte que je portais en moi. J’aurais dû me dire que l’autre, la réelle, était peut-être entièrement différente de celle-là, ignorait tous les regrets que je lui prêtais, pensait probablement beaucoup moins à moi non seulement que moi à elle, mais que je ne la faisais elle-même penser à moi quand j’étais seul en tête à tête avec ma Gilberte fictive, cherchais quelles pouvaient être ses vraies intentions à mon égard et l’imaginais ainsi, son attention toujours tournée vers moi.","I squeezed the ten thousand francs. But they were of no use to me anymore. I spent them, moreover, even more quickly than if I had sent flowers to Gilberte every day, for when evening came I was so unhappy that I could not stay at home and went to cry in the arms of women I loved. did not like. As for trying to give Gilberte any kind of pleasure, I no longer wanted it; now to return to Gilberte's house could only have made me suffer. Even seeing Gilberte again, which would have been so delightful to me the day before, would no longer have been enough for me. Because I would have been worried all the time if I hadn't been near her. This is what makes a woman by any new suffering that she inflicts on us, often without knowing it, increases her power over us, but also our demands on her. By this harm that she has done us, the woman surrounds us more and more, redoubles our chains, but also those which until then it would have seemed sufficient for us to bind her for us to feel at ease. The day before, if I had not thought I was boring Gilberte, I would have contented myself with asking for rare interviews, which now would not have satisfied me and which I would have replaced by many other conditions. Because in love, contrary to what happens after fights, we make them harder, we keep making them worse, the more we are defeated, if however we are in a position to impose them. This was not my case with regard to Gilberte. So at first I preferred not to go back to his mother. I kept telling myself that Gilberte didn't love me, that I had known that for a long enough time, that I could see her again if I wanted to, and, if I didn't want to, forget her in the long run. But these ideas, like a remedy which does not act against certain affections, were without any kind of effective power against these two parallel lines which I saw again from time to time, of Gilberte and of the young man sinking with small steps into the 'Champs-Elysees avenue. It was a new evil, which too would eventually wear out, it was an image which one day would present itself to my mind entirely decanted of all that it contained harmful, like those deadly poisons which one handles without danger, like a little dynamite with which you can light your cigarette without fear of an explosion. In the meantime, there was another force within me which struggled with all its might against this unhealthy force which represented to me without change Gilberte's walk in the twilight and which, to break the renewed assaults on my memory, was working usefully in the opposite direction. my imagination. The first of these two forces, of course, continued to show me these two walkers on the avenue des Champs-Élysées, and offered me other unpleasant images, drawn from the past, for example Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay with me. But the second force, working on the canvas of my hopes, sketched out a future that was much more complacently developed than this poor past that was, on the whole, so restricted. For one minute when I saw Gilberte sullen again, how many were there not when I concocted a step she would have taken for our reconciliation, for our engagement perhaps. It is true that this force which the imagination directed towards the future, it drew in spite of everything from the past. As my boredom that Gilberte had shrugged her shoulders faded away, the memory of her charm would also diminish, a memory that made me wish she would come back to me. But I was still a long way from this death of the past. I still loved the one that it is true that I thought I hated. But every time I was found to have my hair done, looking good, I would have liked her to be there. I was irritated by the desire that many people expressed at that time to receive me and to whom I refused to go. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner where there were to be the Bontemps with their niece Albertine, a young girl, almost still a child. The different periods of our life thus overlap with each other. We disdainfully refuse, because of what we love and which will one day be so equal to you, to see what is equal to you today, that we will love tomorrow, that we might have been able to, if we had consented to see him, to love him sooner, and which would have thus shortened your present sufferings, to replace them, it is true, by others. Mine were changing. I was astonished to see in the depths of myself, one day a feeling, the next day another, generally inspired by such hope or such fear relative to Gilberte, to the Gilberte that I carried within me. I should have told myself that the other, the real one, was perhaps entirely different from that one, ignored all the regrets that I ascribed to her, probably thought much less of me not only than I of her, but that I I didn't make her think of me when I was alone alone with my fictitious Gilberte, I tried to find out what her real intentions towards me might be and imagined her like that, her attention always turned towards me.","I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains—but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs–Elysées. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind's eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one's cigarette without fear of an explosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs–Elysées, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte's sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to–day, with whom we shall be in love to–morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the next, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself.","I locked away my 10,000 francs. They were of no use to me now; and they were to end up being spent even more quickly than if I had sent flowers to Gilberte every day, since as twilight came each evening I was so unhappy that, rather than stay at home, I went to lie weeping in the arms of other women whom I did not love. As for trying to please Gilberte with presents, I had lost all desire to do so. To step inside her house now would have been to face the certainty of suffering. Just to see her – a thing that had seemed so exhilarating the previous evening – would have been of little help to me: every moment when I could not be with her would have revived my anxiety. This explains why every new pain that a woman inflicts on us (which she often does without meaning to) increases not only her power over us, but also the demands we make on her. By every use of her power to hurt, the woman constricts us more and more, shackling us with stronger chains; but she also shows us the weakness of those which once seemed strong enough to bind her and thus to enable us to feel untroubled by her. Only the day before, had I not wanted to avoid upsetting Gilberte, I would have settled for infrequent meetings with her; but now these could no longer have satisfied me, and my conditions would have been very different. For in love, unlike war, the more one is defeated, the more one imposes harsh conditions; and one constantly tries to make them harsher, if one is actually in a position to impose any, that is. With Gilberte, I was not in this position. So to begin with, I preferred not to go back to her mother’s house. I also went on telling myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ages, that I could see her whenever I liked and that, if I preferred not to see her, I would eventually forget her. But these thoughts, like a medication which has no effect on certain disorders, were quite ineffectual against what came intermittently to my mind: those two close silhouettes of Gilberte and that young man, stepping slowly along the avenue des Champs-Élysées. This was a new pain, but one which would eventually fade and disappear in its turn; it was an image which one day would come back to my mind with all its noxious power neutralized, like those deadly poisons which can be handled without danger, or the small piece of dynamite one can use to light a cigarette without fear of being blown up. For the time being, though, there was another force in me, fighting for all it was worth against the pernicious impulse which kept showing me, without the slightest alteration, Gilberte walking through the twilight: working against memory, trying to withstand its repeated onslaughts, there was the quiet and helpful endeavour of imagination. The force of memory went on showing the pair walking down the avenue des Champs-Élysées, along with other irksome images from the past, such as Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay in with me. But the second force, sketching freely on the canvas of my hopes, improvised a future which was much more lovingly detailed than the meagre glimpses afforded by such a paltry past. To think that, against a single moment of the sullen Gilberte, I had a wealth of other moments, all devoted to her attempts to bring about our reconciliation – or even our engagement! This force, though directed towards the future by my imagination, did of course draw its sustenance from the past; and as my unhappiness at Gilberte’s surly shrug of the shoulders gradually faded, so would my memory of her charm and the yearning for her that came with it. However, at the present moment, that death of the past was still remote. I still loved Gilberte, though I believed I hated her. Whenever somebody complimented me on the neatness of my hair, whenever anyone said I was looking well, I wished she could be there to hear it. Throughout that whole period, I was irritated by receiving so many invitations; and I turned them all down. On one occasion there was a great row at home, because I declined to accompany my father to an official function, at which M. and Mme Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, who was then little more than a child. The different periods of our life overlap. Because you are now in love with someone who will one day mean nothing to you, you refuse out of hand to meet someone who means nothing to you now, but whom you will one day come to love, someone whom you might have loved sooner if you had agreed to an earlier meeting, who might have curtailed your present sufferings (before replacing them, of course, with others). My own sufferings were changing. I was surprised to notice certain feelings in myself, one day a particular emotion, the following day some quite different one, generally inspired by some hope or fear focussed on Gilberte. The Gilberte of my private imaginings, I mean. But I ought to have borne in mind that the other Gilberte, the real one, was perhaps utterly different from this private one, that she probably lived in ignorance of all the regrets I invented for her to feel, and thought not only much less about me than I about her, but much less than I pretended she thought about me in my moments of private communion with the fictitious Gilberte, when I longed to know her real intentions towards me and pictured her as spending her days doting on me."
"Il y avait des jours où nous goûtions dans l’une des fermes-restaurants du voisinage. Ce sont les fermes dites des Écorres, Marie-Thérèse, de la Croix d’Heuland, de Bagatelle, de Californie, de Marie-Antoinette. C’est cette dernière qu’avait adoptée la petite bande.","There were days when we tasted at one of the nearby farmhouse restaurants. These are the so-called Écorres, Marie-Thérèse, Croix d'Heuland, Bagatelle, California and Marie-Antoinette farms. It was the latter that the little band had adopted.","Some days we took our refreshment at one of the outlying farms which catered to visitors. These were the farms known as Les Ecorres, Marie–Thérèse, La Croix d'Heuland, Bagatelle, Californie and Marie–Antoinette. It was the last that had been adopted by the little band.","On some days, we would take tea in one of the neighbourhood farmhouse-inns. These are the farms known as Les Écorres, the Marie-Thérèse, the Croix-d’Heuland, the Bagatelle, the Californie and the Marie-Antoinette. It was the last of these that the little gang of girls had adopted."
"J’avais cru, il y avait quelques heures, qu’Albertine ne répondrait à mon salut que de loin. Nous venions de nous quitter en faisant le projet d’une excursion ensemble. Je me promis, quand je rencontrerais Albertine, d’être plus hardi avec elle, et je m’étais tracé d’avance le plan de tout ce que je lui dirais et même (maintenant que j’avais tout à fait l’impression qu’elle devait être légère) de tous les plaisirs que je lui demanderais. Mais l’esprit est influençable comme la plante, comme la cellule, comme les éléments chimiques, et le milieu qui le modifie si on l’y plonge, ce sont des circonstances, un cadre nouveau. Devenu différent par le fait de sa présence même, quand je me trouvai de nouveau avec Albertine, je lui dis tout autre chose que ce que j’avais projeté. Puis me souvenant de la tempe enflammée je me demandais si Albertine n’appréciait pas davantage une gentillesse qu’elle saurait être désintéressée. Enfin j’étais embarrassé devant certains de ses regards, de ses sourires. Ils pouvaient signifier mœurs faciles, mais aussi gaieté un peu bête d’une jeune fille sémillante mais ayant un fond d’honnêteté. Une même expression, de figure comme de langage, pouvant comporter diverses acceptions ; j’étais hésitant comme un élève devant les difficultés d’une version grecque.","I had thought, a few hours ago, that Albertine would only respond to my greeting from afar. We had just left each other planning an excursion together. I promised myself, when I met Albertine, to be bolder with her, and I had traced out in advance the plan of everything I would say to her and even (now that I had the complete impression that she had to be light) of all the pleasures I would ask of her. But the mind can be influenced like the plant, like the cell, like the chemical elements, and the environment that modifies it if you immerse it in it, these are circumstances, a new framework. Having become different by the fact of her very presence, when I found myself again with Albertine, I told her something quite different from what I had planned. Then remembering the inflamed temple, I wondered if Albertine did not appreciate a kindness more than she would know how to be disinterested. Finally, I was embarrassed by some of his looks, his smiles. They could mean easy morals, but also the somewhat silly cheerfulness of a lively young girl but with a background of honesty. The same expression, of figure as of language, which can have various meanings; I was hesitant like a student faced with the difficulties of a Greek version.","I had thought, a few hours before, that Albertine would acknowledge my bow but would not speak to me. We had now parted, after planning to make some excursion soon together. I vowed that when I next met Albertine I would treat her with greater boldness, and I had sketched out in advance a draft of all that I would say to her, and even (being now quite convinced that she was not strait–laced) of all the favours that I would demand of her. But the mind is subject to external influences, as plants are, and cells and chemical elements, and the medium in which its immersion alters it is a change of circumstances, or new surroundings. Grown different by the mere fact of her presence, when I found myself once again in Albertine's company, what I said to her was not at all what I had meant to say. Remembering her flushed temple, I asked myself whether she might not appreciate more keenly a polite attention which she knew to be disinterested. Besides, I was embarrassed by certain things in her look, in her smile. They might equally well signify a laxity of morals and the rather silly merriment of a girl who though full of spirits was at heart thoroughly respectable. A single expression, on a face as in speech, is susceptible of divers interpretations, and I stood hesitating like a schoolboy faced by the difficulties of a piece of Greek prose.","Some hours before, I had believed Albertine would give me only a distant nod. Now we had just agreed to an outing together. I resolved that, the next time I met her, I would be more forward; and I drew up a detailed scheme for what to say to her and even, since I had a strong impression that she was not overburdened by virtue, for all the pleasures she would lend herself to at my suggestion. But the mind is as susceptible to influence as any plant, any cell, any chemical elements; and the milieu which modifies it is the circumstances by which it is surrounded, a new setting. The presence of Albertine was enough to make me different; and when I was next with her the things I said were also completely different from what I had planned. Then, remembering her flushed temple, I wondered whether she might not be more appreciative of a kindness on my part which she would know was not self-interested. I was also perplexed by some looks she gave me, a way she had of smiling. They might be taken to mean easy virtue; but they might also mean the guileless if silly gaiety of a girl who, though vivacious, is fundamentally virtuous. There being more than one connotation for a single expression, whether on her face or in her speech, I was as hesitant as a pupil faced with the difficulties of a Greek unseen."
"Ce changement n’était peut-être pas aussi extraordinaire que le trouvait M. de Norpois. Odette n’avait pas cru que Swann finirait par l’épouser ; chaque fois qu’elle lui annonçait tendancieusement qu’un homme comme il faut venait de se marier avec sa maîtresse, elle lui avait vu garder un silence glacial et tout au plus, si elle l’interpellait directement en lui demandant : « Alors, tu ne trouves pas que c’est très bien, que c’est bien beau ce qu’il a fait là, pour une femme qui lui a consacré sa jeunesse ? », répondre sèchement : « Mais je ne te dis pas que ce soit mal, chacun agit à sa guise. » Elle n’était même pas loin de croire que, comme il le lui disait dans des moments de colère, il l’abandonnerait tout à fait, car elle avait depuis peu entendu dire par une femme sculpteur : « On peut s’attendre à tout de la part des hommes, ils sont si mufles », et frappée par la profondeur de cette maxime pessimiste, elle se l’était appropriée, elle la répétait à tout bout de champ d’un air découragé qui semblait dire : « Après tout, il n’y aurait rien d’impossible, c’est bien ma chance. » Et, par suite, toute vertu avait été enlevée à la maxime optimiste qui avait jusque-là guidé Odette dans la vie : « On peut tout faire aux hommes qui vous aiment, ils sont idiots », et qui s’exprimait dans son visage par le même clignement d’yeux qui eût pu accompagner des mots tels que : « Ayez pas peur, il ne cassera rien. » En attendant, Odette souffrait de ce que telle de ses amies, épousée par un homme qui était resté moins longtemps avec elle qu’elle-même avec Swann, et n’avait pas, elle, d’enfant, relativement considérée maintenant, invitée aux bals de l’Élysée, devait penser de la conduite de Swann. Un consultant plus profond que ne l’était M. de Norpois eût sans doute pu diagnostiquer que c’était ce sentiment d’humiliation et de honte qui avait aigri Odette, que le caractère infernal qu’elle montrait ne lui était pas essentiel, n’était pas un mal sans remède, et eût aisément prédit ce qui était arrivé, à savoir qu’un régime nouveau, le régime matrimonial, ferait cesser avec une rapidité presque magique ces accidents pénibles, quotidiens, mais nullement organiques. Presque tout le monde s’étonna de ce mariage, et cela même est étonnant. Sans doute peu de personnes comprennent le caractère purement subjectif du phénomène qu’est l’amour, et la sorte de création que c’est d’une personne supplémentaire, distincte de celle qui porte le même nom dans le monde, et dont la plupart des éléments sont tirés de nous-mêmes. Aussi y a-t-il peu de gens qui puissent trouver naturelles les proportions énormes que finit par prendre pour nous un être qui n’est pas le même que celui qu’ils voient. Pourtant il semble qu’en ce qui concerne Odette on aurait pu se rendre compte que si, certes, elle n’avait jamais entièrement compris l’intelligence de Swann, du moins savait-elle les titres, tout le détail de ses travaux, au point que le nom de Ver Meer lui était aussi familier que celui de son couturier ; de Swann, elle connaissait à fond ces traits du caractère que le reste du monde ignore ou ridiculise et dont seule une maîtresse, une sœur, possèdent l’image ressemblante et aimée ; et nous tenons tellement à eux, même à ceux que nous voudrions le plus corriger, que c’est parce qu’une femme finit par en prendre une habitude indulgente et amicalement railleuse, pareille à l’habitude que nous en avons nous-mêmes, et qu’en ont nos parents, que les vieilles liaisons ont quelque chose de la douceur et de la force des affections de famille. Les liens qui nous unissent à un être se trouvent sanctifiés quand il se place au même point de vue que nous pour juger une de nos tares. Et parmi ces traits particuliers, il y en avait aussi qui appartenaient autant à l’intelligence de Swann qu’à son caractère, et que pourtant, en raison de la racine qu’ils avaient malgré tout en celui-ci, Odette avait plus facilement discernés. Elle se plaignait que quand Swann faisait métier d’écrivain, quand il publiait des études, on ne reconnût pas ces traits-là autant que dans les lettres ou dans sa conversation où ils abondaient. Elle lui conseillait de leur faire la part la plus grande. Elle l’aurait voulu parce que c’était ceux qu’elle préférait en lui, mais comme elle les préférait parce qu’ils étaient plus à lui, elle n’avait peut-être pas tort de souhaiter qu’on les retrouvât dans ce qu’il écrivait. Peut-être aussi pensait-elle que des ouvrages plus vivants, en lui procurant enfin à lui le succès, lui eussent permis à elle de se faire ce que chez les Verdurin elle avait appris à mettre au-dessus de tout : un salon.","This change was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois thought it to be. Odette had not believed that Swann would end up marrying her; each time she tendentiously announced to him that a decent man had just married his mistress, she had seen him keep an icy silence and at most, if she called out to him directly by asking him: ""So, you Don't you think it's very good, it's very beautiful what he did there, for a woman who devoted her youth to him? “, answer curtly: “But I do not tell you that it is bad, each one acts as he pleases. She was not even far from believing that, as he told her in moments of anger, he would abandon her altogether, for she had recently heard a woman sculptor say: ""We can expect everything from men, they are such muffs"", and struck by the profundity of this pessimistic maxim, she had appropriated it, she repeated it all the time with a discouraged air which seemed to say: ""After all , there would be nothing impossible, it is my luck. And, as a result, all virtue had been taken away from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette in life: ""You can do anything to the men who love you, they are idiots"", and which was expressed in her face. with the same blink of an eye that might have accompanied words such as: ""Don't be afraid, he won't break anything."" In the meantime, Odette suffered from the fact that one of her friends, married by a man who had spent less time with her than she had with Swann, and had no children, relatively considered now, invited at the Elysée balls, must have thought of Swann's conduct. A deeper consultant than M. de Norpois would no doubt have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of humiliation and shame that had embittered Odette, that the infernal character she displayed was not essential to her, It was not an evil without remedy, and would have easily predicted what had happened, namely that a new regime, the matrimonial regime, would put an end with an almost magical rapidity to these painful, daily, but in no way organic accidents. Almost everyone was astonished at this marriage, and even that is astonishing. Probably few people understand the purely subjective character of the phenomenon that is love, and the kind of creation it is of an additional person, distinct from the one who bears the same name in the world, and whose majority elements are drawn from ourselves. Also there are few people who can find natural the enormous proportions that end up assuming for us a being who is not the same as the one they see. However, it seems that as far as Odette is concerned, one could have realized that if, of course, she had never fully understood Swann's intelligence, at least she knew the titles, all the details of his works, at least so much so that the name of Ver Meer was as familiar to him as that of his dressmaker; of Swann, she knew thoroughly those traits of character which the rest of the world ignores or ridicules and of which only a mistress, a sister, possesses the resembling and beloved image; and we care so much about them, even those whom we would most like to correct, that it is because a woman ends up acquiring an indulgent and friendly mocking habit of them, similar to the habit that we ourselves have of them, and what do our parents have of it, that old liaisons have something of the sweetness and strength of family affections. The ties that unite us to a being are sanctified when he takes the same point of view as us to judge one of our flaws. And among these particular traits, there were also some which belonged as much to Swann's intelligence as to his character, and which nevertheless, because of the root they had in spite of everything, Odette had more easily discerned. She complained that when Swann worked as a writer, when he published studies, one did not recognize these traits as much as in the letters or in his conversation where they abounded. She advised him to give them the greatest part. She would have liked it because they were the ones she preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were more his, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they were found in this place. that he was writing. Perhaps she also thought that more lively works, by at last bringing him success, would have enabled her to have what at the Verdurins she had learned to put above all else: a salon.","This alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: ""Don't you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?"" had heard him answer dryly: "" But I don't say that there's anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right. "" She came very near, indeed, to believing that (as he used to threaten in moments of anger) he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that ""You cannot be surprised at anything men do, they're such brutes,"" and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: ""After all, it's not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck. "" Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: ""You can do anything with men when they're in love with you, they're such idiots!"" a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: ""Don't be frightened; he won't break anything. "" While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elysée and so forth, must think of Swann's behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann's mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter , Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins' she had been taught to value above everything else in the world—a salon.","This change in Odette may not have been such an extraordinary thing as M. de Norpois thought. She had never believed that Swann would eventually marry her. Every time she informed him in a meaning tone that a certain fashionable gentleman had just married his mistress, she had been met with an icy silence; and if she went so far as to say to him straight out, ‘So, don’t you think that was a nice thing to do? Don’t you think it’s the decent thing for him to make an honest woman of someone that’s given him the best years of her life?’ the most she ever got was the tart reply, ‘I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it – he can please himself.’ In fact, Odette had come close to believing that he would do what he sometimes threatened to do in a fit of temper, and leave her for good, for she had not long since heard a sculptress declare, ‘There’s nothing men won’t stoop to , there’s not a good one among them’; and the pessimism of this profound verity had so struck her that she had taken to uttering it in all sorts of situations, accompanying it with a defeated air which seemed to mean, ‘Well, what would you expect, it’d be just my luck!’ As a consequence, all efficacy had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette’s steps through life: ‘You can treat men that are in love with you any way you like, they’re such fools,’ to which she always gave the twinkle of the eye which might accompany a statement like, ‘Don’t worry – he’s quite house-trained!’ Meanwhile, Odette was mortified to think how Swann’s conduct must appear to one of her friends, who had recently managed to marry a man whom she had been ‘with’ for a shorter time than Swann and Odette had been together, although she did not even have a child by him, and who was relatively accepted now, receiving invitations to balls at the Élysée Palace. A more perceptive clinician than M. de Norpois could no doubt have made a different diagnosis: that it was this feeling of humiliation and shame that had embittered Odette, that the shrewish character which came out in her was neither integral to her nor an incurable malady; and he might have easily foreseen what had in fact taken place, that a new regimen, marriage, would bring about an almost magical remission of these painful attacks which, though of daily occurrence, were in no way organic. The marriage came as a surprise to almost everybody, which is itself a surprise. No doubt, few people understand either the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon of love, or how it creates a supplementary person who is quite different from the one who bears our beloved’s name in the outside world, and is mostly formed from elements within ourselves. So there are few who see anything natural in the disproportionate dimensions which we come to perceive in a person who is not the same as the one they see. In the case of Odette, however, it should have been possible to notice that, though she had admittedly never fully appreciated the quality of Swann’s mind, at least she was acquainted with the titles and the details of his writings, that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as the name of her dressmaker, that she knew by heart certain traits of Swann, the kind which all other people either mock or do not know, the true fond likeness of which reposes only in a mistress’s or a sister’s heart; and these traits in ourself we cling to so much, even the ones we would most like to see changed, that when a woman comes to have an indulgent and banteringly amicable attachment to them, seeing them rather as they are seen by ourselves and by our close relatives, a long-standing liaison can come to have something of the mildness and strength of affections within the family. The feelings we share with another are sanctified when, in judging one of our faults, that person adopts the same point of view as we do. However, there were certain aspects of Swann’s mind which Odette had in fact appreciated, since they too were in part outcomes of his character. She lamented the fact that when Swann did produce a study or some other piece of writing, these aspects were not as perceptible as in his letters or in his conversation, where they abounded. She suggested that he should give them greater scope. Her reason for this was that it was these features she herself preferred in the man; but since this preference meant only that these things were more ‘him’ than others, she may have been right to wish they might be more visible in his writings. Perhaps she thought too that if these writings could have more vitality in them, they might be more successful, which might then have enabled her to aspire to the thing which in her time with the Verdurins she had come to see as the greatest of all achievements – a salon of her own."
"Une après-midi de grande chaleur j’étais dans la salle à manger de l’hôtel qu’on avait laissée à demi dans l’obscurité pour la protéger du soleil en tirant des rideaux qu’il jaunissait et qui par leurs interstices laissaient clignoter le bleu de la mer, quand, dans la travée centrale qui allait de la plage à la route, je vis, grand, mince, le cou dégagé, la tête haute et fièrement portée, passer un jeune homme aux yeux pénétrants et dont la peau était aussi blonde et les cheveux aussi dorés que s’ils avaient absorbé tous les rayons du soleil. Vêtu d’une étoffe souple et blanchâtre comme je n’aurais jamais cru qu’un homme eût osé en porter, et dont la minceur n’évoquait pas moins que le frais de la salle à manger la chaleur et le beau temps du dehors, il marchait vite. Ses yeux, de l’un desquels tombait à tout moment un monocle, étaient de la couleur de la mer. Chacun le regarda curieusement passer, on savait que ce jeune marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray était célèbre pour son élégance. Tous les journaux avaient décrit le costume dans lequel il avait récemment servi de témoin au jeune duc d’Uzès, dans un duel. Il semblait que la qualité si particulière de ses cheveux, de ses yeux, de sa peau, de sa tournure, qui l’eussent distingué au milieu d’une foule comme un filon précieux d’opale azurée et lumineuse, engainé dans une matière grossière, devait correspondre à une vie différente de celle des autres hommes. Et en conséquence, quand avant la liaison dont Mme de Villeparisis se plaignait, les plus jolies femmes du grand monde se l’étaient disputé, sa présence, dans une plage par exemple, à côté de la beauté en renom à laquelle il faisait la cour ne la mettait pas seulement tout à fait en vedette, mais attirait les regards autant sur lui que sur elle. À cause de son « chic », de son impertinence de jeune « lion », à cause de son extraordinaire beauté surtout, certains lui trouvaient même un air efféminé, mais sans le lui reprocher, car on savait combien il était viril et qu’il aimait passionnément les femmes. C’était ce neveu de Mme de Villeparisis duquel elle nous avait parlé. Je fus ravi de penser que j’allais le connaître pendant quelques semaines et sûr qu’il me donnerait toute son affection. Il traversa rapidement l’hôtel dans toute sa largeur, semblant poursuivre son monocle qui voltigeait devant lui comme un papillon. Il venait de la plage, et la mer qui remplissait jusqu’à mi-hauteur le vitrage du hall lui faisait un fond sur lequel il se détachait en pied, comme dans certains portraits où des peintres prétendent sans tricher en rien sur l’observation la plus exacte de la vie actuelle, mais en choisissant pour leur modèle un cadre approprié, pelouse de polo, de golf, champ de courses, pont de yacht, donner un équivalent moderne de ces toiles où les primitifs faisaient apparaître la figure humaine au premier plan d’un paysage. Une voiture à deux chevaux l’attendait devant la porte ; et tandis que son monocle reprenait ses ébats sur la route ensoleillée, avec l’élégance et la maîtrise qu’un grand pianiste trouve le moyen de montrer dans le trait le plus simple, où il ne semblait pas possible qu’il sût se montrer supérieur à un exécutant de deuxième ordre, le neveu de Mme de Villeparisis, prenant les guides que lui passa le cocher, s’assit à côté de lui et tout en décachetant une lettre que le directeur de l’hôtel lui remit, fit partir les bêtes.","One very hot afternoon I was in the dining room of the hotel which had been left half dark to protect it from the sun by drawing curtains which were yellowing and which through their interstices allowed them to flicker the blue of the sea, when, in the central bay that went from the beach to the road, I saw, tall, thin, neck exposed, head high and proudly carried, pass a young man with penetrating eyes and whose skin was as blonde and her hair as golden as if it had absorbed all the rays of the sun. Dressed in a supple, whitish fabric such as I would never have believed a man would have dared to wear, and whose thinness evoked no less than the coolness of the dining room the heat and fine weather outside, he walked quickly. His eyes, from one of which constantly dropped a monocle, were the color of the sea. Everyone watched him pass curiously, it was known that this young Marquis of Saint-Loup-en-Bray was famous for his elegance. All the newspapers had described the costume in which he had recently served as a witness to the young Duke of Uzès, in a duel. It seemed that the particular quality of his hair, of his eyes, of his skin, of his figure, which had distinguished him in the midst of a crowd like a precious vein of azure and luminous opal, sheathed in a coarse material , had to correspond to a life different from that of other men. And consequently, when before the affair of which Madame de Villeparisis complained, the prettiest women in the world had disputed him, his presence, on a beach for example, next to the renowned beauty to whom he was courting not only put her in the spotlight, but drew attention to him as well as her. Because of his ""chic"", his impertinence as a young ""lion"", above all because of his extraordinary beauty, some even thought he had an effeminate air, but without reproaching him for it, because we knew how virile he was and that he passionately loved women. It was that nephew of Madame de Villeparisis of whom she had spoken to us. I was delighted to think that I was going to know him for a few weeks and sure that he would give me all his affection. He quickly crossed the whole width of the hotel, seeming to pursue his monocle which fluttered in front of him like a butterfly. He had come from the beach, and the sea which filled halfway up the glass of the hall gave him a background against which he stood out full length, as in certain portraits where painters claim, without cheating in any way on observation, the more exact of current life, but by choosing for their model an appropriate setting, polo field, golf course, racetrack, yacht deck, to give a modern equivalent of these canvases where the primitives made the human figure appear in the foreground of a landscape. A two-horse carriage was waiting for him outside the door; and while his monocle resumed its frolics on the sunny road, with the elegance and the control that a great pianist finds the means to show in the simplest line, where it did not seem possible that he knew how to show himself superior to a second-rate performer, the nephew of Madame de Villeparisis, taking the guides passed to him by the coachman, sat down beside him and, while unsealing a letter that the manager of the hotel gave him, made the animals leave .","In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered. One afternoon of scorching heat I was in the dining–room of the hotel, which they had plunged in semi–darkness, to shield it from the glare, by drawing the curtains which the sun gilded, while through the gaps between them I caught flashing blue glimpses of the sea, when along the central gangway leading inland from the beach to the high road I saw, tall, slender, his head held proudly erect upon a springing neck, a young man go past with searching eyes, whose skin was as fair and whose hair as golden as if they had absorbed all the rays of the sun. Dressed in a clinging, almost white material such as I could never have believed that any man would have the audacity to wear, the thinness of which suggested no less vividly than the coolness of the dining–room the heat and brightness of the glorious day outside, he was walking fast. His eyes, from one of which a monocle kept dropping, were of the colour of the sea. Everyone looked at him with interest as he passed, knowing that this young Marquis de Saint–Loup–en–Bray was famed for the smartness of his clothes. All the newspapers had described the suit in which he had recently acted as second to the young Duc d'Uzès in a duel. One felt that this so special quality of his hair, his eyes, his skin, his figure, which would have marked him out in a crowd like a precious vein of opal, azure–shot and luminous, embedded in a mass of coarser substance, must correspond to a life different from that led by other men. So that when, before the attachment which Mme. de Villeparisis had been deploring, the prettiest women in society had disputed the possession of him, his presence, at a watering–place for instance, in the company of the beauty of the season to whom he was paying court, not only made her conspicuous, but attracted every eye fully as much to himself. Because of his 'tone,' of his impertinence befitting a young 'lion,' and especially of his astonishing good looks, some people even thought him effeminate, though without attaching any stigma, for everyone knew how manly he was and that he was a passionate 'womaniser.' This was Mme. de Villeparisis's nephew of whom she had spoken to us. I was overcome with joy at the thought that I was going to know him and to see him for several weeks on end, and confident that he would bestow on me all his affection. He strode rapidly across the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach, and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall gave him a background against which he was drawn at full length, as in certain portraits whose painters attempt, without in anyway falsifying the most accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their sitter appropriate surroundings, a polo ground, golf links, a racecourse, the bridge of a yacht, to furnish a modern equivalent of those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human figure in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair was waiting for him at the door; and, while his monocle resumed its gambollings in the air of the sunlit street, with the elegance and mastery which a great pianist contrives to display in the simplest piece of execution, where it has not appeared possible that he could shew himself superior to a performer of the second class, Mme. de Villeparisis's nephew, taking the reins that were handed him by the groom, jumped on to the box seat by his side and, while he opened a letter which the manager of the hotel sent out after him, made his horses start.","On some of our drives together, she had spoken very warmly of his high intelligence and especially his kind heart, and I had been imagining how he would take a liking to me, how I would become his favourite friend; then, when his aunt hinted to my grandmother, before his arrival, that he had had the misfortune to fall madly in love with some impossible woman who now had him in her clutches and would not let him go, as I was convinced that love affairs of that sort could only lead to mental derangement, crime and suicide, the thought of how little time was left for our friendship, which was already so strong in my heart although I had not set eyes on him, moved me to tears for the misfortunes which must attend it, as though it was some beloved companion who one learns is seriously ill and not expected to live long. One very hot afternoon, from inside the dining-room, which was in half-darkness, sheltering from the sun behind drawn curtains, which were a yellow glow edged by the blue dazzle of the sea, I saw, traversing the hotel’s central bay, which extended from the beach to the road, a tall, slim, young man with piercing eyes, a proud head held high on a fine uncovered neck, and with hair so golden and skin so fair that they seemed to have soaked up the bright sunshine of the day. In a loose off-white garment, the like of which I would never have believed a man would dare to wear, and which in its lightness was as suggestive of the heat and brilliance of outdoors as was the cool dimness of the dining-room, he was advancing at a quick march. His eyes, from which a monocle kept dropping, were the colour of the sea. We all sat there, intrigued, watching him as he passed, knowing that we beheld the young Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, famous in the fashionable world. The newspapers had recently been full of descriptions of the suit he had worn when attending at a duel, as a second for the young Duc d’Uzès. It seemed as though the very special quality of his hair and eyes, his skin and bearing, which would have distinguished him in a crowd, as a pale precious vein of luminous opal stands out among crude earth, must be the mark of a life quite unlike those lived by ordinary men. In the days before the beginning of the liaison lamented by Mme de Villeparisis, when the prettiest women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain had vied for his attentions, his presence at a seaside resort, for example, with whichever celebrated beauty he was courting at the time, not only thrust the lady into the limelight, but also turned all heads towards him. Because of his general ‘stylishness’ as a young ‘lion’, his cavalier manner and above all his own remarkable beauty, some thought there was something effeminate about him, though no one ever said such a thing against him, as his virility and passionate liking for women were well known. This was the nephew of whom Mme de Villeparisis had spoken. I was warmed by the thought that, for these few weeks, I would have the opportunity of knowing him, and by the certainty that he would give me his affection. He strode right through the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which fluttered in front of him like a butterfly. He had come up from the beach; and the sea, which filled the lower half of the plate-glass in the vestibule, was a background against which his whole figure stood out, as in those portraits in which the painter, without departing from the strictest observation of present-day life, chooses to put his model in an apt setting – a polo ground, a golf-course, a race-track, the deck of a yacht – making a modern equivalent of the old masters’ canvasses in which a human figure stands in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair awaited him at the door; and with his monocle now flitting about against the background of the sunny roadway, the nephew of Mme de Villeparisis, with all the grace and command that a virtuoso pianist is somehow able to show even in the simplest passage, where it would have seemed barely possible for him to display any superiority over a lesser performer, climbed up beside his coachman, accepted the reins from the latter and, opening the while an envelope that the manager of the hotel handed to him, set the horses off."
"Comme je quittais l’église, je vis devant le vieux pont des filles du village qui, sans doute parce que c’était un dimanche, se tenaient attifées, interpellant les garçons qui passaient. Moins bien vêtue que les autres, mais semblant les dominer par quelque ascendant – car elle répondait à peine à ce qu’elles lui disaient – l’air plus grave et plus volontaire, il y en avait une grande qui assise à demi sur le rebord du pont, laissant pendre ses jambes, avait devant elle un petit pot plein de poissons qu’elle venait probablement de pêcher. Elle avait un teint bruni, des yeux doux, mais un regard dédaigneux de ce qui l’entourait, un petit nez d’une forme fine et charmante. Mes regards se posaient sur sa peau et mes lèvres à la rigueur pouvaient croire qu’elles avaient suivi mes regards. Mais ce n’est pas seulement son corps que j’aurais voulu atteindre, c’était aussi la personne qui vivait en lui et avec laquelle il n’est qu’une sorte d’attouchement, qui est d’attirer son attention, qu’une sorte de pénétration, y éveiller une idée.","As I was leaving the church, I saw in front of the old bridge some girls from the village who, no doubt because it was a Sunday, stood decked up, calling out to the boys who were passing. Less well dressed than the others, but seeming to dominate them by some ascendancy - for she hardly answered what they said to her - looking more serious and more determined, there was a tall one who was half seated on the ledge. from the bridge, letting her legs dangle, had in front of her a small pot full of fish that she had probably just caught. She had a tanned complexion, soft eyes, but a disdainful look at her surroundings, a small nose of a fine and charming shape. My gaze rested on her skin and my lips at a pinch could believe that they had followed my gaze. But it is not only his body that I would have liked to reach, it was also the person who lived in him and with whom he is only a kind of touch, which is to attract his attention, that a kind of penetration, to awaken an idea there.","As I came away from the church I saw by the old bridge a cluster of girls from the village who, probably because it was Sunday, were standing about in their best clothes, rallying the young men who went past. Not so well dressed as the others, but seeming to enjoy some ascendancy over them—for she scarcely answered when they spoke to her—with a more serious and a more determined air, there was a tall one who, hoisted upon the parapet of the bridge with her feet hanging down, was holding on her lap a small vessel full of fish which she had presumably just been catching. She had a tanned complexion, gentle eyes but with a look of contempt for her surroundings, a small nose, delicately and attractively modelled. My eyes rested upon her skin; and my lips, had the need arisen, might have believed that they had followed my eyes. But it was not only to her body that I should have liked to attain, there was also her person, which abode within her, and with which there is but one form of contact, namely to attract its attention, but one sort of penetration, to awaken an idea in it.","As I left the church, I noticed a few village girls in their garish Sunday finery, standing about down by the old bridge and bantering with the local lads. One of the taller of the girls, less showily dressed than the others, but apparently superior to them in some way (she paid little attention to what they said to her), with a more solemn and bolder look to her, was half-sitting on the parapet of the bridge, dangling her legs, beside a little jar full of fish which she had presumably just caught. Her face was tanned; her eyes, though gentle, were full of disdain for her surroundings; and the line of her neat little nose was delicate and charming. My eyes rested on her skin and my lips could almost believe they had done likewise. It was not only her body I was after , it was the person living inside it, with whom there can only be one mode of touching, which is to attract her attention, and one mode of penetration, which is to put an idea into her mind."
"Il fut bien vite convenu entre lui et moi que nous étions devenus de grands amis pour toujours, et il disait « notre amitié » comme s’il eût parlé de quelque chose d’important et de délicieux qui eût existé en dehors de nous-mêmes et qu’il appela bientôt – en mettant à part son amour pour sa maîtresse – la meilleure joie de sa vie. Ces paroles me causaient une sorte de tristesse, et j’étais embarrassé pour y répondre, car je n’éprouvais à me trouver, à causer avec lui – et sans doute c’eût été de même avec tout autre – rien de ce bonheur qu’il m’était au contraire possible de ressentir quand j’étais sans compagnon. Seul, quelquefois, je sentais affluer du fond de moi quelqu’une de ces impressions qui me donnaient un bien-être délicieux. Mais dès que j’étais avec quelqu’un, dès que je parlais à un ami, mon esprit faisait volte-face, c’était vers cet interlocuteur et non vers moi-même qu’il dirigeait ses pensées, et quand elles suivaient ce sens inverse, elles ne me procuraient aucun plaisir. Une fois que j’avais quitté Saint-Loup, je mettais, à l’aide de mots, une sorte d’ordre dans les minutes confuses que j’avais passées avec lui ; je me disais que j’avais un bon ami, qu’un bon ami est une chose rare et je goûtais, à me sentir entouré de biens difficiles à acquérir, ce qui était justement l’opposé du plaisir qui m’était naturel, l’opposé du plaisir d’avoir extrait de moi-même et amené à la lumière quelque chose qui y était caché dans la pénombre. Si j’avais passé deux ou trois heures à causer avec Robert de Saint-Loup et qu’il eût admiré ce que je lui avais dit, j’éprouvais une sorte de remords, de regret, de fatigues de ne pas être resté seul et prêt enfin à travailler. Mais je me disais qu’on n’est pas intelligent que pour soi-même, que les plus grands ont désiré d’être appréciés, que je ne pouvais pas considérer comme perdues des heures où j’avais bâti une haute idée de moi dans l’esprit de mon ami, je me persuadais facilement que je devais en être heureux et je souhaitais d’autant plus vivement que ce bonheur ne me fût jamais enlevé, que je ne l’avais pas ressenti. On craint plus que de tous les autres la disparition des biens restés en dehors de nous parce que notre cœur ne s’en est pas emparé. Je me sentais capable d’exercer les vertus de l’amitié mieux que beaucoup (parce que je ferais toujours passer le bien de mes amis avant ces intérêts personnels auxquels d’autres sont attachés et qui ne comptaient pas pour moi), mais non pas de connaître la joie par un sentiment qui, au lieu d’accroître les différences qu’il y avait entre mon âme et celles des autres – comme il y en a entre les âmes de chacun de nous – les effacerait. En revanche par moment ma pensée démêlait en Saint-Loup un être plus général que lui-même, le « noble », et qui comme un esprit intérieur mouvait ses membres, ordonnait ses gestes et ses actions ; alors, à ces moments-là, quoique près de lui, j’étais seul comme je l’eusse été devant un paysage dont j’aurais compris l’harmonie. Il n’était plus qu’un objet que ma rêverie cherchait à approfondir. À retrouver toujours en lui cet être antérieur, séculaire, cet aristocrate que Robert aspirait justement à ne pas être, j’éprouvais une vive joie, mais d’intelligence, non d’amitié. Dans l’agilité morale et physique qui donnait tant de grâce à son amabilité, dans l’aisance avec laquelle il offrait sa voiture à ma grand’mère et l’y faisait monter, dans son adresse à sauter du siège quand il avait peur que j’eusse froid, pour jeter son propre manteau sur mes épaules, je ne sentais pas seulement la souplesse héréditaire des grands chasseurs qu’avaient été depuis des générations les ancêtres de ce jeune homme qui ne prétendait qu’à l’intellectualité, leur dédain de la richesse qui, subsistant chez lui à côté du goût qu’il avait d’elle rien que pour pouvoir mieux fêter ses amis, lui faisait mettre si négligemment son luxe à leurs pieds ; j’y sentais surtout la certitude ou l’illusion qu’avaient eu ces grands seigneurs d’être « plus que les autres », grâce à quoi ils n’avaient pu léguer à Saint-Loup ce désir de montrer qu’on est « autant que les autres », cette peur de paraître trop empressé qui lui était en effet vraiment inconnue et qui enlaidit de tant de laideur et de gaucherie la plus sincère amabilité plébéienne. Quelquefois je me reprochais de prendre ainsi plaisir à considérer mon ami comme une œuvre d’art, c’est-à-dire à regarder le jeu de toutes les parties de son être comme harmonieusement réglé par une idée générale à laquelle elles étaient suspendues mais qu’il ne connaissait pas et qui par conséquent n’ajoutait rien à ses qualités propres, à cette valeur personnelle d’intelligence et de moralité à quoi il attachait tant de prix.","It was quickly agreed between him and me that we had become great friends forever, and he said ""our friendship"" as if he were talking about something important and delicious that existed outside of ourselves. and which he soon called - apart from his love for his mistress - the best joy of his life. These words caused me a kind of sadness, and I was embarrassed to answer them, for I felt in finding myself, in chatting with him - and doubtless it would have been the same with any other - none of this happiness that On the contrary, it was possible for me to feel when I was without a companion. Alone, sometimes, I felt surging from the depths of me some of those impressions which gave me a delicious well-being. But as soon as I was with someone, as soon as I spoke to a friend, my mind turned around, it was towards this interlocutor and not towards myself that he directed his thoughts, and when they followed this opposite direction, they gave me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint-Loup, I put, with the help of words, a sort of order in the confused minutes I had spent with him; I said to myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend is a rare thing and I enjoyed feeling surrounded by possessions that were difficult to acquire, which was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me. opposed to the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden there in the half-light. If I had spent two or three hours chatting with Robert de Saint-Loup and he had admired what I had told him, I felt a kind of remorse, regret, fatigue at not having remained alone and finally ready to work. But I said to myself that one is not intelligent only for oneself, that the greatest have wanted to be appreciated, that I could not consider as wasted the hours when I had built up a lofty idea of myself in the spirit of my friend, I easily persuaded myself that I should be happy about it and I wished all the more strongly that this happiness had never been taken away from me, that I had not felt it. We fear more than all the others the disappearance of the goods that have remained outside of us because our heart has not taken hold of them. I felt able to exercise the virtues of friendship better than many (because I would always put the good of my friends before those personal interests which others are attached to and which did not matter to me), but not to know joy through a feeling which, instead of increasing the differences that there were between my soul and those of others – as there are between the souls of each of us – would erase them. On the other hand, at times my thoughts unraveled in Saint-Loup a being more general than himself, the ""noble,"" who like an interior spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at those moments, although near him, I was alone as I would have been before a landscape whose harmony I would have understood. He was no more than an object that my reverie sought to deepen. To always find in him that previous, secular being, that aristocrat that Robert precisely aspired not to be, I felt a great joy, but of intelligence, not of friendship. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his friendliness, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his car and got her into it, in his skill in jumping from the seat when he was afraid that I was cold to throw his own coat over my shoulders, I felt not only the hereditary suppleness of the great hunters that the ancestors of this young man who claimed only intellectuality had been for generations, their disdain of the wealth which, subsisting at home alongside the taste he had for her, simply to be able to entertain his friends better, made him so negligently lay his luxury at their feet; I felt there above all the certainty or the illusion that these great lords had had of being ""more than the others"", thanks to which they had not been able to bequeath to Saint-Loup this desire to show that one is "" as much as the others”, this fear of appearing too hasty which was indeed truly unknown to him and which ugliness with so much ugliness and awkwardness the most sincere plebeian friendliness. Sometimes I reproached myself for taking such pleasure in considering my friend as a work of art, that is to say in regarding the interplay of all the parts of his being as harmoniously regulated by a general idea to which they were suspended but which he did not know and which consequently added nothing to his own qualities, to that personal value of intelligence and morality to which he attached so much value.","It was promptly settled between us that he and I were to be great friends for ever, and he would say 'our friendship' as though he were speaking of some important and delightful thing which had an existence independent of ourselves, and which he soon called—not counting his love for his mistress—the great joy of his life. These words made me rather uncomfortable and I was at a loss for an answer, for I did not feel when I was with him and talked to him—and no doubt it would have been the same with everyone else—any of that happiness which it was, on the other hand, possible for me to experience when I was by myself. For alone, at times, I felt surging from the depths of my being one or other of those impressions which gave me a delicious sense of comfort. But as soon as I was with some one else, when I began to talk to a friend, my mind at once 'turned about,' it was towards the listener and not myself that it directed its thoughts, and when they followed this outward course they brought me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint– Loup, I managed, with the help of words, to put more or less in order the confused minutes that I had spent with him; I told myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend was a rare thing, and I tasted, when I felt myself surrounded by 'goods' that were difficult to acquire, what was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden in my inner darkness. If I had spent two or three hours in conversation with Saint–Loup, and he had expressed his admiration of what I had said to him, I felt a sort of remorse, or regret, or weariness at not having been left alone and ready, at last, to begin my work. But I told myself that one is not given intelligence for one's own benefit only, that the greatest of men have longed for appreciation, that I could not regard as wasted hours in which I had built up an exalted idea of myself in the mind of my friend; I had no difficulty in persuading myself that I ought to be happy in consequence, and I hoped all the more anxiously that this happiness might never be taken from me simply because I had not yet been conscious of it. We fear more than the loss of everything else the disappearance of the 'goods' that have remained beyond our reach, because our heart has not taken possession of them. I felt that I was capable of exemplifying the virtues of friendship better than most people (because I should always place the good of my friends before those personal interests to which other people were devoted but which did not count for me), but not of finding happiness in a feeling which, instead of multiplying the differences that there were between my nature and those of other people—as there are among all of us—would cancel them. At the same time my mind was distinguishing in Saint– Loup a personality more collective than his own, that of the 'noble'; which like an indwelling spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at such moments, although in his company, I was as much alone as I should have been gazing at a landscape the harmony of which I could understand. He was no more then than an object the properties of which, in my musing contemplations, I sought to explore. The perpetual discovery in him of this pre–existent, this aeonial creature, this aristocrat who was just what Robert aspired not to be, gave me a keen delight, but one that was intellectual and not social. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his kindnesses, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his carriage and made her get into it, in the alacrity with which he sprang from the box, when he was afraid that I might be cold, to spread his own cloak over my shoulders, I felt not only the inherited litheness of the mighty hunters who had been for generations the ancestors of this young man who made no pretence save to intellectuality, their scorn of wealth which, subsisting in him side by side with his enjoyment of it simply because it enabled him to entertain his friends more lavishly, made him so carelessly shower his riches at their feet; I felt in him especially the certainty or the illusion in the minds of those great lords of being 'better than other people,' thanks to which they had not been able to hand down to Saint– Loup that anxiety to shew that one is ""just as good"", that dread of seeming inferior, of which he was indeed wholly unconscious, but which mars with so much ugliness, so much awkwardness, the most sincere overtures of a plebeian. Sometimes I found fault with myself for thus taking pleasure in my friend as in a work of art, that is to say in regarding the play of all the parts of his being as harmoniously ordered by a general idea from which they depended but which he did not know, so that it added nothing to his own good qualities, to that personal value, intellectual and moral, to which he attached so high a price.","It was very soon agreed between us that we had become firm friends for ever, and each time he said ‘our friendship’ it was as though he spoke of some important and delightful entity existing outside ourselves – before long he even came to say that, apart from his love for his mistress, it was the greatest joy in his life. Such talk saddened me in a way, and I never knew how to respond to it: for in spending my time chatting with him, I felt none of the happiness I was capable of deriving from being without company; and in this, I suspect it would have been the same for me with any other person. It was only when I was alone that I would be swept on occasion by one of those impressions which brought with them such deeply satisfying feelings. But I only had to be in the presence of someone else, talking with a friend for instance, for my mind to face the wrong way, occupying itself with thoughts directed towards the other person rather than towards myself; and thoughts going in that other direction never afforded me any enjoyment. No sooner had I left the company of Saint-Loup than I sought words with which to tidy up the disordered minutes I had just spent with him : I assured myself that I had a close friend and that a close friend is a rarity; yet in knowing I was the recipient of things difficult to come by, what I felt was the exact opposite of the mode of enjoyment natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure that could come from finding something lying deep within myself, from bringing it out of its inner darkness and into the light of day. Whenever I spent two or three hours talking with Robert de Saint-Loup, and if he was impressed by what I had been saying, I was overcome by something like remorse, regret or weariness, vexed at not having spent the time alone, at not having got down once and for all to the work that awaited me. Then I would assure myself that there is no law against others’ appreciation of one’s cleverest ideas, that even the greatest minds may be excused for being admired, that it was not right to see a waste of time in hours which had led my friend to form a high opinion of me; I had no difficulty in convincing myself that I should really be happy about all this, and my hope that such happiness would never leave me was as strong as my knowledge that I had never in fact felt it. The joys we most dread losing are those which have remained outside us, beyond the reach of our heart. Although I felt I was better able than most to practise the virtues of friendship (in that I would always see the interests of my friends as counting for more than the sort of selfish advantage that motivates others, but which I ignored), I was aware of my own inability to find joy in a feeling which, rather than enhancing the differences between my mind and the minds of others – differences which exist among all minds – would abolish them. However, there were also moments when my mind could detect in Saint-Loup a creature of wider generality than himself, the ‘nobleman’, a being which, like some inner daemon, moved his limbs, directed his gestures and his actions; and at such times, though sitting beside him, I was as alone as I would have been gazing at a landscape and appreciating its harmonies. He had become an object for my thoughts to toy with in an idle moment. To glimpse through him the earlier, immemorial, aristocratic self that Robert sought to avoid being was to experience a keen joy, but it was a joy generated by the mind, not by friendship. In the moral and physical agility which gave him such grace in friendliness, in his easy manner as he offered my grandmother a lift in his carriage and handed her in, then in the nimble way he jumped down from the box when he feared I might be feeling the cold, so as to drape his own overcoat about my shoulders, I sensed not only the hereditary deftness of generations of great hunters, the ancestors of this young man who prized nothing so much as things of the mind, not only their disdain for wealth, which, though he also enjoyed being wealthy for the sole reason that he could afford to make much of his friends, had come down to him in a casual habit of lavishing luxury on them, but also especially the knowledge (or possibly the illusion) these grand personages had entertained of being ‘above other people’, which had prevented them from handing on to Saint-Loup any wish to show he was ‘no better than other people’, any reluctance to appear overfriendly, of which he was genuinely devoid but which can spoil even the sincerest likings of the less-than-noble with much stiff and awkward posturing. Occasionally I would feel a little guilty at delighting in this view of my friend as a work of art, at seeing the smooth interplay of his component parts as being regulated by a general idea which underlay their structure and function, but which, because he was unaware of it, added nothing to his inherent qualities as an individual, or to those personal values of mind and morality which he saw as paramount."
"Et elle nous faisait entrer dans la salle à manger, sombre comme l’intérieur d’un Temple asiatique peint par Rembrandt, et où un gâteau architectural, aussi débonnaire et familier qu’il était imposant, semblait trôner là à tout hasard comme un jour quelconque, pour le cas où il aurait pris fantaisie à Gilberte de le découronner de ses créneaux en chocolat et d’abattre ses remparts aux pentes fauves et raides, cuites au four comme les bastions du palais de Darius. Bien mieux, pour procéder à la destruction de la pâtisserie ninitive, Gilberte ne consultait pas seulement sa faim ; elle s’informait encore de la mienne, tandis qu’elle extrayait pour moi du monument écroulé tout un pan verni et cloisonné de fruits écarlates, dans le goût oriental. Elle me demandait même l’heure à laquelle mes parents dînaient, comme si je l’avais encore sue, comme si le trouble qui me dominait avait laissé persister la sensation de l’inappétence ou de la faim, la notion du dîner ou l’image de la famille, dans ma mémoire vide et mon estomac paralysé. Malheureusement cette paralysie n’était que momentanée. Les gâteaux que je prenais sans m’en apercevoir, il viendrait un moment où il faudrait les digérer. Mais il était encore lointain. En attendant, Gilberte me faisait « mon thé ». J’en buvais indéfiniment, alors qu’une seule tasse m’empêchait de dormir pour vingt-quatre heures. Aussi ma mère avait-elle l’habitude de dire : « C’est ennuyeux, cet enfant ne peut aller chez les Swann sans rentrer malade. » Mais savais-je seulement, quand j’étais chez les Swann, que c’était du thé que je buvais ? L’eussé-je su que j’en eusse pris tout de même, car en admettant que j’eusse recouvré un instant le discernement du présent, cela ne m’eût pas rendu le souvenir du passé et la prévision de l’avenir. Mon imagination n’était pas capable d’aller jusqu’au temps lointain où je pourrais avoir l’idée de me coucher et le besoin du sommeil.","And she ushered us into the dining room, dark as the interior of an Asian temple painted by Rembrandt, and where an architectural cake, as good-natured and familiar as it was imposing, seemed to sit there haphazardly like a day. whatever, in case Gilberte should have taken it into her head to uncrown it from its chocolate crenellations and demolish its ramparts with their steep, tawny slopes, baked in the oven like the bastions of Darius' palace. Much better, to proceed with the destruction of the ninitive pastry, Gilberte did not only consult her hunger; she was still inquiring about mine, while she was extracting for me from the collapsed monument a whole section varnished and partitioned with scarlet fruits, in the oriental style. She even asked me what time my parents ate dinner, as if I had still known it, as if the disorder that dominated me had allowed the feeling of inappetence or hunger to persist, the notion of dinner or image of the family, in my empty memory and my paralyzed stomach. Unfortunately, this paralysis was only temporary. The cakes that I took without realizing it, there would come a time when I would have to digest them. But he was still far away. In the meantime, Gilberte was making me ""my tea."" I drank it indefinitely, while a single cup kept me awake for twenty-four hours. So my mother used to say, ""It's boring, that child can't go to the Swanns without coming home sick."" But did I even know, when I was with the Swanns, that it was tea I drank? Had I known that I would have taken it all the same, for admitting that I had recovered for a moment the discernment of the present, that would not have given me back the memory of the past and the forecast of the future. My imagination was not able to go to the distant time when I could have the idea of going to bed and the need for sleep.","And she would make us go into the dining–room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental style. She asked me even at what o'clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making 'my' tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty–four hours. Which explains why my mother used always to say: ""What a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms' without coming home ill."" But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns', that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present , that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep.","Whereupon, she would show us through to the dining-room, which was as dim as an Asian temple interior as Rembrandt might have painted it, and was dominated by the architectural splendour of a cake, as cheerful and familiar as it was imposing, which seemed to be standing there as though this day was an ordinary day, just in case Gilberte might have felt a passing urge to demolish its chocolate battlements and lay waste the slopes of its steep, dark ramparts, baked like the bastions of Darius’ palace. The best thing was that, in setting about the destruction of her Ninevite cake-castle, Gilberte was motivated not only by the urges of her own appetite; she inquired also about mine, as she salvaged for me from the crumbling ruins a whole wall varnished and studded with scarlet fruit, in the Oriental style. She even asked me what time my parents dined, as though I knew something about it, as though the emotional upset from which I was suffering could enable any sensation such as lack of appetite or hunger, any notion of dinner or family, to survive in my vacant memory and paralysed stomach. Unfortunately this paralysis was only temporary; and there would come a time when cakes which I consumed without noticing them would have to be digested. But that moment was still in the future; and in the present, Gilberte made ‘my tea’. I drank huge quantities of it, although normally a single cup of tea would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. So it was that my mother had come to remark, ‘It’s a worry – as sure as that boy goes to the Swanns’ he comes home sick.’ But while I was at the Swanns’ I would have been unable to say whether or not it was really tea I was drinking. And even if I had known, I would have gone on drinking it; for even if I had been restored momentarily to proper awareness of the present, this would not have given me back the ability to remember the past or foresee the future. My imagination was incapable of stretching to the remote moment when I might feel tired or think of going to bed."
– Mais l’église de Balbec est en partie romane ?,"""But the church of Balbec is partly Romanesque?""","""But, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?""","– But the church of Balbec is partly Romanesque, isn’t it?"
"Cependant, comme presque chaque fois que j’allais la voir, Mme Swann m’invitait à venir goûter avec sa fille et me disait de répondre directement à celle-ci, j’écrivais souvent à Gilberte, et dans cette correspondance je ne choisissais pas les phrases qui eussent pu, me semblait-il, la persuader, je cherchais seulement à frayer le lit le plus doux au ruissellement de mes pleurs. Car le regret comme le désir ne cherche pas à s’analyser, mais à se satisfaire ; quand on commence d’aimer, on passe le temps non à savoir ce qu’est son amour, mais à préparer les possibilités des rendez-vous du lendemain. Quand on renonce, on cherche non à connaître son chagrin, mais à offrir de lui à celle qui le cause l’expression qui nous paraît la plus tendre. On dit les choses qu’on éprouve le besoin de dire et que l’autre ne comprendra pas, on ne parle que pour soi-même. J’écrivais : « J’avais cru que ce ne serait pas possible. Hélas, je vois que ce n’est pas si difficile. » Je disais aussi : « Je ne vous verrai probablement plus », je le disais en continuant à me garder d’une froideur qu’elle eût pu croire affectée, et ces mots, en les écrivant, me faisaient pleurer, parce que je sentais qu’ils exprimaient non ce que j’aurais voulu croire, mais ce qui arriverait en réalité. Car à la prochaine demande de rendez-vous qu’elle me ferait adresser, j’aurais encore comme cette fois le courage de ne pas céder et, de refus en refus, j’arriverais peu à peu au moment où à force de ne plus l’avoir vue je ne désirerais pas la voir. Je pleurais mais je trouvais le courage, je connaissais la douceur, de sacrifier le bonheur d’être auprès d’elle à la possibilité de lui paraître agréable un jour, un jour où, hélas ! lui paraître agréable me serait indifférent. L’hypothèse même, pourtant si peu vraisemblable, qu’en ce moment, comme elle l’avait prétendu pendant la dernière visite que je lui avais faite, elle m’aimât, que ce que je prenais pour l’ennui qu’on éprouve auprès de quelqu’un dont on est las ne fût dû qu’à une susceptibilité jalouse, à une feinte d’indifférence analogue à la mienne, ne faisait que rendre ma résolution moins cruelle. Il me semblait alors que dans quelques années, après que nous nous serions oubliés l’un l’autre, quand je pourrais rétrospectivement lui dire que cette lettre qu’en ce moment j’étais en train de lui écrire n’avait été nullement sincère, elle me répondrait : « Comment, vous, vous m’aimiez ? Si vous saviez comme je l’attendais, cette lettre, comme j’espérais un rendez-vous, comme elle me fit pleurer. » La pensée, pendant que je lui écrivais, aussitôt rentré de chez sa mère, que j’étais peut-être en train de consommer précisément ce malentendu-là, cette pensée par sa tristesse même, par le plaisir d’imaginer que j’étais aimé de Gilberte, me poussait à continuer ma lettre.","However, as almost every time I went to see her, Madame Swann invited me to come and have tea with her daughter and told me to reply directly to her, I often wrote to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the sentences that could, it seemed to me, have persuaded her, I only tried to make the softest bed for the streaming of my tears. For regret, like desire, does not seek to be analyzed, but to be satisfied; when you begin to love, you pass the time not knowing what your love is, but preparing for the possibilities of the next day's meetings. When we give up, we seek not to know our sorrow, but to offer of it to the one who causes it the expression that seems to us the most tender. We say the things that we feel the need to say and that the other will not understand, we only speak for ourselves. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see that it is not so difficult. I also said: ""I probably won't see you again"", I said it while continuing to guard myself against a coldness which she might have thought affected, and these words, while writing them, made me cry, because I felt that they expressed not what I would have liked to believe, but what would actually happen. Because the next time she asked me to meet, I would still have the courage, like this time, not to give in and, from refusal to refusal, I would gradually arrive at the moment when, by dint of no longer to have seen it I would not wish to see it. I cried but I found the courage, I knew the sweetness, to sacrifice the happiness of being near her to the possibility of appearing pleasant to her one day, a day when, alas! to seem agreeable to him would be indifferent to me. The very hypothesis, yet so improbable, that at this moment, as she had claimed during the last visit I had made to her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom one experiences near someone of whom one is weary was due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a pretense of indifference analogous to mine, only rendered my resolution less cruel. It seemed to me then that in a few years, after we would have forgotten each other, when I could retrospectively tell him that this letter that I was writing to him at that moment had been in no way sincere. , she would answer me: “How, you, you loved me? If you knew how I expected this letter, how I hoped for a meeting, how it made me cry. The thought, while I was writing to him, as soon as I returned from his mother's, that I was perhaps in the process of consuming precisely this misunderstanding, this thought by its very sadness, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, urged me to continue my letter.","Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the expressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one's time, not in getting to know what one's love really is, but in making it possible to meet next day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one's grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: ""I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult. "" I said also: ""I shall probably not see you again;"" I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they expressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, ""What, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it. "" The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother's house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter.","In fact, since Mme Swann, almost every time I went to visit her, would invite me to come to tea with her and her daughter, and told me to send my reply direct to Gilberte, I often had occasion to write to her, sending her notes that I filled not with words which might have won her over, but with words chosen for the sole purpose of letting my sorrow flow free and sweet. Regret, like desire, seeks satisfaction and not self-analysis: in the beginning of love, our time is spent not in finding out what love is made of, but in trying to make sure we can see each other tomorrow; and at the end of love, you do not try to ascertain the nature of your sorrow, but only to voice it in what you hope is its tenderest form to her who is the cause of it. You say things you feel the need to say and which she will not understand; you talk only for your own benefit. So I wrote to Gilberte: I used to believe it couldn’t be possible. But I can see now, alas, it’s not that difficult … Though I added: I expect I’ll never see you again, I was still careful not to adopt a distant tone, which might have made her suspect it was feigned; and as I wrote these words, I was in tears, because I felt they expressed, not what I would have liked to believe, but what was in fact going to happen. I knew that when her next invitation came, I would once again be brave enough not to give in, and that each successive invitation declined would bring me gradually to a time when, having gone without seeing her for so long , I would have no further wish to see her at all. So with tears, courage and consolation, I sacrificed the happiness of being with her to the possibility of one day seeming lovable in her eyes, though knowing it would be a day when the prospect of seeming lovable in her eyes would leave me cold. Even the albeit highly unlikely hypothesis that at this very instant she still loved me, as she had claimed during my last visit to her, that what I saw as the annoyance of having to be with someone whose company is irksome was really only an expression of touchy possessiveness, an affectation of indifference no more genuine in her than mine was in me, served only to make my determination less cruel. And I felt as though, at a time several years hence, when we had completely forgotten one another, when I could look back on this letter I was writing and tell her there had been not one word of sincerity in it, she would say, ‘What? You mean you did love me? Oh, if you only knew how I had been looking forward to getting that letter! How I longed for us to meet! How I cried when I read it!’ As I sat writing to her, having just come home from visiting her mother, the thought that I was possibly there and then in the act of consummating that very misunderstanding, the sadness of it all, the joy of believing Gilberte loved me, made me go on with my letter."
"– Vous avez dû être enchanté, surtout si c’était la première fois que vous l’entendiez. Monsieur votre père s’alarmait du contre-coup que cette petite escapade pouvait avoir sur votre état de santé, car vous êtes un peu délicat, un peu frêle, je crois. Mais je l’ai rassuré. Les théâtres ne sont plus aujourd’hui ce qu’ils étaient il y a seulement vingt ans. Vous avez des sièges à peu près confortables, une atmosphère renouvelée, quoique nous ayons fort à faire encore pour rejoindre l’Allemagne et l’Angleterre, qui à cet égard comme à bien d’autres ont une formidable avance sur nous. Je n’ai pas vu MmeBerma dans Phèdre, mais j’ai entendu dire qu’elle y était admirable. Et vous avez été ravi, naturellement ?","“You must have been delighted, especially if it was the first time you heard it. Your father was alarmed at the repercussions this little escapade could have on your state of health, for you are a little delicate, a little frail, I believe. But I reassured him. Theaters are no longer what they were twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats, a renewed atmosphere, although we still have a lot to do to catch up with Germany and England, which in this respect as in many others have a formidable lead over us. I did not see Madame Berma in Phèdre, but I have heard that she was admirable there. And you were delighted, of course?","""You must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to–day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Phèdre, but I have always heard that she is excellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?""","‘You must have been delighted,’ M. de Norpois said; ‘especially if you were seeing her for the first time.

However, I reassured him. Theatres nowadays are not what they used to be, even just twenty years ago. I mean, one has more or less comfortable seats to sit in; and the air circulates a bit – though we still have a long way to go to equal Germany and England, which in that respect (as in many another!) have far outstripped us. I have never seen Mme Berma in Phèdre, but I have been told she is outstanding. It must, of course, have been a great thrill for you.’"
– Ah ! mais voilà une nouvelle recrue et qui lui en amènera d’autres.,– Ah! but here is a new recruit and who will bring him others.,"That's a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.""",‘Now there’s a new recruit! And she’ll bring in others.’
"Quand M. de Norpois fut parti, mon père jeta un coup d’œil sur le journal du soir ; je songeais de nouveau à la Berma. Le plaisir que j’avais eu à l’entendre exigeait d’autant plus d’être complété qu’il était loin d’égaler celui que je m’étais promis ; aussi s’assimilait-il immédiatement tout ce qui était susceptible de le nourrir, par exemple ces mérites que M. de Norpois avait reconnus à la Berma et que mon esprit avait bus d’un seul trait comme un pré trop sec sur qui on verse de l’eau. Or mon père me passa le journal en me désignant un entrefilet conçu en ces termes : « La représentation de Phèdre qui a été donnée devant une salle enthousiaste où on remarquait les principales notabilités du monde des arts et de la critique a été pour MmeBerma, qui jouait le rôle de Phèdre, l’occasion d’un triomphe comme elle en a rarement connu de plus éclatant au cours de sa prestigieuse carrière. Nous reviendrons plus longuement sur cette représentation qui constitue un véritable événement théâtral ; disons seulement que les juges les plus autorisés s’accordaient à déclarer qu’une telle interprétation renouvelait entièrement le rôle de Phèdre, qui est un des plus beaux et des plus fouillés de Racine, et constituait la plus pure et la plus haute manifestation d’art à laquelle de notre temps il ait été donné d’assister. » Dès que mon esprit eut conçu cette idée nouvelle de « la plus pure et haute manifestation d’art », celle-ci se rapprocha du plaisir imparfait que j’avais éprouvé au théâtre, lui ajouta un peu de ce qui lui manquait et leur réunion forma quelque chose de si exaltant que je m’écriai : « Quelle grande artiste ! » Sans doute on peut trouver que je n’étais pas absolument sincère. Mais qu’on songe plutôt à tant d’écrivains qui, mécontents du morceau qu’ils viennent d’écrire, s’ils lisent un éloge du génie de Chateaubriand, ou évoquant tel grand artiste dont ils ont souhaité d’être l’égal, fredonnant par exemple en eux-mêmes telle phrase de Beethoven de laquelle ils comparent la tristesse à celle qu’ils ont voulu mettre dans leur prose, se remplissent tellement de cette idée de génie qu’ils l’ajoutent à leurs propres productions en repensant à elles, ne les voient plus telles qu’elles leur étaient apparues d’abord, et risquant un acte de foi dans la valeur de leur œuvre se disent : « Après tout ! » sans se rendre compte que, dans le total qui détermine leur satisfaction finale, ils font entrer le souvenir de merveilleuses pages de Chateaubriand qu’ils assimilent aux leurs, mais enfin qu’ils n’ont point écrites ; qu’on se rappelle tant d’hommes qui croient en l’amour d’une maîtresse de qui ils ne connaissent que les trahisons ; tous ceux aussi qui espèrent alternativement soit une survie incompréhensible dès qu’ils pensent, maris inconsolables, à une femme qu’ils ont perdue et qu’ils aiment encore, artistes, à la gloire future de laquelle ils pourront jouir, soit un néant rassurant quand leur intelligence se reporte au contraire aux fautes que sans lui ils auraient à expier après leur mort ; qu’on pense encore aux touristes qu’exalte la beauté d’ensemble d’un voyage dont jour par jour ils n’ont éprouvé que de l’ennui, et qu’on dise, si dans la vie en commun que mènent les idées au sein de notre esprit, il est une seule de celles qui nous rendent le plus heureux qui n’ait été d’abord en véritable parasite demander à une idée étrangère et voisine le meilleur de la force qui lui manquait.","When M. de Norpois had gone, my father glanced at the evening paper; I thought again of Berma. The pleasure I had had in hearing it demanded all the more to be completed because it was far from equaling that which I had promised myself; so he immediately assimilated everything that was likely to nourish him, for example those merits which M. de Norpois had recognized in Berma and which my some water. But my father handed me the newspaper, pointing to a paragraph written in these terms: ""The performance of Phèdre which was given before an enthusiastic audience where the main notables of the world of art and criticism were noticed was for Mme Berma, who played the role of Phèdre, the occasion of a triumph such as she has rarely known more brilliant during her prestigious career. We will return at greater length to this performance which constitutes a real theatrical event; let us only say that the most authoritative judges agreed in declaring that such an interpretation entirely renewed the role of Phèdre, which is one of the most beautiful and detailed of Racine, and constituted the purest and highest manifestation of art to which in our time it has been given to assist. As soon as my mind had conceived this new idea of ""the purest and highest manifestation of art"", it approached the imperfect pleasure I had felt in the theater, added to it a little of what it lacked and meeting formed something so exhilarating that I exclaimed: “What a great artist! No doubt one may find that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us think rather of so many writers who, dissatisfied with the piece they have just written, if they read a eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoking some great artist of whom they wished to be the equal , humming to themselves, for example, a phrase from Beethoven whose sadness they compare to that which they wanted to put in their prose, fill themselves so much with this idea of genius that they add it to their own productions by rethinking to them, no longer see them as they had first appeared to them, and risking an act of faith in the value of their work say to themselves: “After all! without realizing that, in the total which determines their final satisfaction, they include the memory of marvelous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but in the end which they have not written; that we remember so many men who believe in the love of a mistress of whom they only know the betrayals; all those also who alternately hope either for an incomprehensible survival as soon as they think, inconsolable husbands, of a woman they have lost and whom they still love, artists, whose future glory they will be able to enjoy, or a reassuring nothingness when, on the contrary, their intelligence refers to the faults which without it they would have to expiate after their death; that one still thinks of the tourists who are exalted by the overall beauty of a journey from which day by day they have experienced nothing but boredom, and that one says, if in the life in common that ideas lead in the heart of our mind, there is only one of those which make us happiest who has not been at first like a veritable parasite to ask from a foreign and neighboring idea the best of the strength which it lacked.","After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for instance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:— The performance of Phèdre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Phèdre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine's creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness. Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of ""the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art,"" it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so exalting that I cried out within myself: "" What a great artist! "" It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: ""After all!"" without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked.","After M. de Norpois’s departure, my father glanced at the evening paper, while I sat thinking over my experience of La Berma. The pleasure I had taken in seeing her act was so far from the pleasure I had been looking forward to, and was in such acute need of sustenance, that it immediately assimilated whatever might nourish it, such as the qualities M. de Norpois had identified in her acting, which my mind had absorbed as easily as a parched meadow soaks up water. My father now handed me the newspaper, pointing to a review of the matinée: ‘The performance of Phèdre given today before an enthusiastic audience, distinguished by the presence of the foremost personalities in the world of the arts and criticism, afforded Mme Berma in the title part the opportunity to score a triumph than which, in the whole course of her illustrious career, she has rarely had a greater. We shall have more, much more, to say on another occasion about this production, which marks a veritable milestone in the theatre. Suffice it for the moment to note that the best qualified judges are as one in pronouncing that such an interpretation will stand not only as a landmark in our appreciation of the character of Phèdre, one of the greatest and the most searching parts ever produced by Racine, but also as the finest, highest achievement in the realm of art that any of us have been privileged to witness in this day and age.’ This new concept of ‘the finest, highest achievement in the realm of art’ had no sooner entered my mind than it located the imperfect enjoyment I had had at the theatre, and added to it a little of what it lacked; this made such a heady mixture that I exclaimed, ‘What a great artiste she is!’ It may be thought I was not altogether sincere. Think, however, of so many writers who, in a moment of dissatisfaction with a piece they have just written, may read a eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or who may think of some other great artist whom they have dreamed of equalling, who hum to themselves a phrase of Beethoven’s for instance, comparing the sadness of it to the mood they have tried to capture in their prose, and are then so carried away by that perception of genius that they let it affect the way they read their own piece, no longer seeing it as they first saw it, but going so far as to hazard an act of faith in the value of it, by telling themselves, ‘It’s not bad, you know!’ without realizing that the sum total which determines their ultimate satisfaction includes the memory of Chateaubriand’s brilliant pages, which they have assimilated to their own but which, of course, they did not write. Think of all the men who go on believing in the love of a mistress in whom nothing is more flagrant than her infidelities; of all those torn between the hope of something beyond this life (such as the bereft widower who remembers a beloved wife, or the artist who indulges in dreams of posthumous fame, each of them looking forward to an after-life which he knows is inconceivable) and the desire for a reassuring oblivion, when their better judgment reminds them of the faults which they might otherwise have to expiate after death; or think of the travellers who are uplifted by the general beauty of a journey they have just completed, although during it their main impression, day after day, was that it was a chore – think of them before deciding whether, given the promiscuity of the ideas that lurk within us, a single one of those which afford us our greatest happiness has not begun life by parasitically attaching itself to a foreign idea with which it happened to come into contact, and by drawing from it much of the power of pleasing which it once lacked."
"En rentrant à Balbec, de telle de ces inconnues à qui il m’avait présenté je me redisais sans m’arrêter une seconde et pourtant sans presque m’en apercevoir : « Quelle femme délicieuse ! » comme on chante un refrain. Certes, ces paroles étaient plutôt dictées par des dispositions nerveuses que par un jugement durable. Il n’en est pas moins vrai que si j’eusse eu mille francs sur moi et qu’il y eût encore des bijoutiers d’ouverts à cette heure-là, j’eusse acheté une bague à l’inconnue. Quand les heures de notre vie se déroulent ainsi que sur des plans trop différents, on se trouve donner trop de soi pour des personnes diverses qui le lendemain vous semblent sans intérêt. Mais on se sent responsable de ce qu’on leur a dit la veille et on veut y faire honneur.","On my way back to Balbec, from one of those strangers to whom he had introduced me, I repeated to myself without stopping for a second and yet almost without realizing it: “What a delicious woman! as one sings a refrain. Certainly, these words were dictated rather by nervous dispositions than by a lasting judgment. It is none the less true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and there were still jewelers open at that hour, I would have bought a ring from the unknown. When the hours of our life unfold like this on too different planes, we find ourselves giving too much of ourselves to diverse people who the next day seem uninteresting to you. But we feel responsible for what we told them the day before and we want to honor it.","On our way back to Balbec, of those of the fair strangers to whom he had introduced me I would repeat to myself without a moment's interruption, and yet almost unconsciously: ""What a delightful woman!"" as one chimes in with the refrain of a song. I admit that these words were prompted rather by the state of my nerves than by any lasting judgment. It was nevertheless true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and if there had still been a jeweller's shop open at that hour, I should have bought the lady a ring. When the successive hours of our life are thus displayed against too widely dissimilar backgrounds, we find that we give away too much of ourselves to all sorts of people who next day will not interest us in the least. But we feel that we are still responsible for what we said to them overnight, and that we must honour our promises.","All the way back to Balbec, if it happened that Robert had introduced me to one or other of these unfamiliar women, I kept repeating to myself, as though singing over a remembered refrain, without a second’s pause, but almost without noticing what I was doing, ‘What a delightful woman!’ The words, rather than expressing a lasting judgment, were prompted by a state of nervous excitement. Nevertheless, if I had had 1,000 francs on me, and if any jewellers had been open at that hour, I would have bought a ring for her. When the compartments in which we live parts of our lives are too different from one another, we can expend ourselves on a person who, by the following day, may come to seem uninteresting. But we feel responsible for what we may have said the night before, and wish to honour it."
"Mais ce désappointement-là n’était guère que spirituel. Je rayonnais de joie dans cette maison où Gilberte, quand elle n’était pas encore avec nous, allait entrer, et me donnerait dans un instant, pour des heures, sa parole, son regard attentif et souriant tel que je l’avais vu pour la première fois à Combray. Tout au plus étais-je un peu jaloux en la voyant souvent disparaître dans de grandes chambres auxquelles on accédait par un escalier intérieur. Obligé de rester au salon, comme l’amoureux d’une actrice qui n’a que son fauteuil à l’orchestre et rêve avec inquiétude de ce qui se passe dans les coulisses, au foyer des artistes, je posai à Swann, au sujet de cette autre partie de la maison, des questions savamment voilées, mais sur un ton duquel je ne parvins pas à bannir quelque anxiété. Il m’expliqua que la pièce où allait Gilberte était la lingerie, s’offrit à me la montrer et me promit que chaque fois que Gilberte aurait à s’y rendre il la forcerait à m’y emmener. Par ces derniers mots et la détente qu’ils me procurèrent, Swann supprima brusquement pour moi une de ces affreuses distances intérieures au terme desquelles une femme que nous aimons nous apparaît si lointaine. À ce moment-là, j’éprouvai pour lui une tendresse que je crus plus profonde que ma tendresse pour Gilberte. Car maître de sa fille, il me la donnait et elle, elle se refusait parfois, je n’avais pas directement sur elle ce même empire qu’indirectement par Swann. Enfin elle, je l’aimais et ne pouvais par conséquent la voir sans ce trouble, sans ce désir de quelque chose de plus, qui ôte, auprès de l’être qu’on aime, la sensation d’aimer.","But this disappointment was hardly more than spiritual. I was beaming with joy in this house where Gilberte, when she was not yet with us, was going to enter, and would give me in an instant, for hours, her words, her attentive and smiling gaze such as I had seen her for the first time in Combray. At most I was a little jealous seeing her often disappearing into large rooms which were accessed by an internal staircase. Obliged to stay in the salon, like the lover of an actress who has only her seat in the orchestra and dreams with anxiety of what is happening behind the scenes, in the artists' foyer, I asked Swann about from that other part of the house, cleverly veiled questions, but in a tone from which I could not banish some anxiety. He explained to me that the room Gilberte went to was the laundry room, offered to show it to me, and promised that whenever Gilberte had to go there he would force her to take me there. By these last words and the relaxation they gave me, Swann abruptly suppressed for me one of those frightful interior distances at the end of which a woman we love seems so distant to us. At that moment, I felt a tenderness for him which I believed to be deeper than my tenderness for Gilberte. Because master of his daughter, he gave her to me and she, she sometimes refused herself, I did not have this same empire over her directly as indirectly through Swann. Finally, I loved her and could not therefore see her without this confusion, without this desire for something more, which removes, near the being one loves, the feeling of loving.","But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing–room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall 'in front' and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green–room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen–room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving.","However, that disappointment was really only in the mind. I was usually radiant with joy in the Swanns’ house, for if Gilberte had not yet joined us, she might come in at any moment and for hours on end let me enjoy her words, her attentive gaze and smile, as I had first seen them at Combray. The greatest of my displeasures was a touch of mild jealousy if she disappeared, as she quite often did, up an inner staircase leading to large rooms on the floor above. Unable to leave the drawing-room, like an actress’s lover who has his seat in the stalls, but can only imagine the disquieting things that may be happening in the wings or the green-room, I sat with Swann and, in a voice which was not without a trace of anxiety, asked cunningly disguised questions about that other part of the house. He explained that the room where she sometimes went was the linen-room, offered to show it to me and promised that, whenever she had to go there, he would make sure she took me with her. With these words and the relief they brought me, he suddenly bridged for me one of those dreadful chasms within the heart, which put such a distance between us and the woman we love. It was a moment when I believed my affection for him was even stronger than my affection for Gilberte. For Swann was the master of his daughter, and it was he who gave her to me; whereas, left to her own devices, she could at times withhold herself from me; I did not have the direct power over her that I could exercise indirectly through him. And since I loved her, I could only ever see her through the confused desire for more of her, which when you are with the person you love, deprives you of the feeling of loving."
"– Mais comment, s’écria mon père, ennuyé de l’impression fâcheuse que l’aveu de mon incompréhension pouvait produire sur M. de Norpois, comment peux-tu dire que tu n’as pas eu de plaisir, ta grand’mère nous a raconté que tu ne perdais pas un mot de ce que la Berma disait, que tu avais les yeux hors de la tête, qu’il n’y avait que toi dans la salle comme cela.","""But how,"" exclaimed my father, annoyed by the unfortunate impression that the admission of my incomprehension might produce on M. de Norpois, ""how can you say that you had no pleasure, your grandmother? told us that you didn't lose a word of what Berma was saying, that your eyes were bulging out of your head, that there was only you in the room like that.","""What's that?"" cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, ""What on earth do you mean; you didn't enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.""","‘What’s that?’ exclaimed my father, appalled at the poor impression my ineptness might make on M. de Norpois. ‘How can you say you didn’t enjoy it? Your grandmother told us you didn’t miss a word, that you just stared and stared at her, that nobody else in the whole audience lapped it up the way you did!’"
"Elle fut certainement désolée de n’avoir pu me faire plaisir et me donna un petit crayon d’or, par cette vertueuse perversité des gens qui, attendris par votre gentillesse et ne souscrivant pas à vous accorder ce qu’elle réclame, veulent cependant faire en votre faveur autre chose : le critique dont l’article flatterait le romancier l’invite à la place à dîner, la duchesse n’emmène pas le snob avec elle au théâtre, mais lui envoie sa loge pour un soir où elle ne l’occupera pas. Tant ceux qui font le moins et pourraient ne rien faire sont poussés par le scrupule à faire quelque chose. Je dis à Albertine qu’en me donnant ce crayon, elle me faisait un grand plaisir, moins grand pourtant que celui que j’aurais eu si le soir où elle était venue coucher à l’hôtel elle m’avait permis de l’embrasser. « Cela m’aurait rendu si heureux ! qu’est-ce que cela pouvait vous faire ? je suis étonné que vous me l’ayez refusé. – Ce qui m’étonne, me répondit-elle, c’est que vous trouviez cela étonnant. Je me demande quelles jeunes filles vous avez pu connaître pour que ma conduite vous ait surpris. – Je suis désolé de vous avoir fâchée, mais, même maintenant je ne peux pas vous dire que je trouve que j’ai eu tort. Mon avis est que ce sont des choses qui n’ont aucune importance, et je ne comprends pas qu’une jeune fille qui peut si facilement faire plaisir, n’y consente pas. Entendons-nous, ajoutai-je pour donner une demi-satisfaction à ses idées morales, en me rappelant comment elle et ses amies avaient flétri l’amie de l’actrice Léa, je ne veux pas dire qu’une jeune fille puisse tout faire et qu’il n’y ait rien d’immoral. Ainsi, tenez, ces relations dont vous parliez l’autre jour à propos d’une petite qui habite Balbec et qui existeraient entre elle et une actrice, je trouve cela ignoble, tellement ignoble que je pense que ce sont des ennemis de la jeune fille qui auront inventé cela et que ce n’est pas vrai. Cela me semble improbable, impossible. Mais se laisser embrasser et même plus par un ami, puisque vous dites que je suis votre ami… – Vous l’êtes, mais j’en ai eu d’autres avant vous, j’ai connu des jeunes gens qui, je vous assure, avaient pour moi tout autant d’amitié. Hé bien, il n’y en a pas un qui aurait osé une chose pareille. Ils savaient la paire de calottes qu’ils auraient reçue. D’ailleurs ils n’y songeaient même pas, on se serrait la main bien franchement, bien amicalement, en bons camarades, jamais on n’aurait parlé de s’embrasser et on n’en était pas moins amis pour cela. Allez, si vous tenez à mon amitié, vous pouvez être content, car il faut que je vous aime joliment pour vous pardonner. Mais je suis sûre que vous vous fichez bien de moi. Avouez que c’est Andrée qui vous plaît. Au fond, vous avez raison, elle est beaucoup plus gentille que moi, et elle est ravissante ! Ah ! les hommes ! » Malgré ma déception récente, ces paroles si franches, en me donnant une grande estime pour Albertine, me causaient une impression très douce. Et peut-être cette impression eut-elle plus tard pour moi de grandes et fâcheuses conséquences, car ce fut par elle que commença à se former ce sentiment presque familial, ce noyau moral qui devait toujours subsister au milieu de mon amour pour Albertine. Un tel sentiment peut être la cause des plus grandes peines. Car pour souffrir vraiment par une femme, il faut avoir cru complètement en elle. Pour le moment, cet embryon d’estime morale, d’amitié, restait au milieu de mon âme comme une pierre d’attente. Il n’eût rien pu, à lui seul, contre mon bonheur s’il fût demeuré ainsi sans s’accroître, dans une inertie qu’il devait garder l’année suivante et à plus forte raison pendant ces dernières semaines de mon premier séjour à Balbec. Il était en moi comme un de ces hôtes qu’il serait malgré tout plus prudent qu’on expulsât, mais qu’on laisse à leur place sans les inquiéter, tant les rendent provisoirement inoffensifs leur faiblesse et leur isolement au milieu d’une âme étrangère.","She was certainly sorry for not having been able to please me and gave me a little gold pencil, by that virtuous perversity of people who, softened by your kindness and not subscribing to grant you what she asks for, nevertheless want to do something else in your favor: the critic whose article would flatter the novelist invites him instead to dinner, the Duchess does not take the snob with her to the theater, but sends him her box for an evening when she does not will not occupy. So many who do the least and could do nothing are driven by scruple to do something. I told Albertine that by giving me this pencil, she gave me great pleasure, less great pleasure, however, than what I would have had if the evening when she had come to sleep at the hotel she had allowed me to kiss her. . “That would have made me so happy! what could that do you? I'm surprised you refused me. “What surprises me,” she replied, “is that you find that astonishing. I wonder what young girls you may have known that my behavior surprised you. “I'm sorry to have upset you, but even now I can't tell you that I think I was wrong. My opinion is that these are things that have no importance, and I do not understand that a young girl who can so easily please, does not consent to it. Let's get along, I added to give half satisfaction to her moral ideas, remembering how she and her friends had stigmatized the actress's friend Léa, I don't want to say that a young girl can do everything. and that there is nothing immoral. So, look, these relationships you were talking about the other day about a little girl who lives in Balbec and which would exist between her and an actress, I find that despicable, so despicable that I think they are enemies of the young girl who will have invented this and that it is not true. It seems improbable, impossible. But letting yourself be kissed, and even more by a friend, since you say I'm your friend… – You are, but I've had others before you, I've known young people who, I assure you , had just as much friendship for me. Well, there is not one who would have dared such a thing. They knew the pair of skullcaps they would have received. Besides, they didn't even think about it, we shook hands very frankly, very amicably, like good comrades, we would never have spoken of kissing and we were friends none the less for that. Come on, if you value my friendship, you can be happy, because I must love you nicely to forgive you. But I'm sure you don't care about me. Admit that you like Andrée. Basically, you're right, she's much nicer than me, and she's lovely! Ah! men ! Despite my recent disappointment, these frank words, while giving me great esteem for Albertine, made a very sweet impression on me. And perhaps this impression had great and unfortunate consequences for me later on, for it was through it that this almost family sentiment began to form, this moral core which was always to subsist in the midst of my love for Albertine. Such a feeling can be the cause of the greatest sorrows. Because to really suffer through a woman, you must have believed completely in her. For the moment, this embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, remained in the middle of my soul like a waiting stone. It could not have done anything, on its own, against my happiness if it had remained thus without increasing, in an inertia which it was to keep the following year and even more so during these last weeks of my first stay. in Balbec. He was in me like one of those guests whom, in spite of everything, it would be more prudent to expel, but whom one leaves in their place without worrying them, so much does their weakness and their isolation in the midst of a soul render them temporarily harmless. foreign.","She was genuinely distressed by her failure to afford me pleasure, and gave me a little gold pencil–case, with that virtuous perversity which people shew who, moved by your supplications and yet not consenting to grant you what those supplications demand, are anxious all the same to bestow on you some mark of their affection; the critic, an article from whose pen would so gratify the novelist, asks him instead to dinner; the duchess does not take the snob with her to the theatre but lends him her box on an evening when she will not be using it herself. So far are those who do least for us, and might easily do nothing, driven by conscience to do something. I told Albertine that in giving me this pencil–case she was affording me great pleasure, and yet not so great as I should have felt if, on the night she had spent at the hotel, she had permitted me to embrace her. ""It would have made me so happy; what possible harm could it have done you? I was simply astounded at your refusing to let me do it."" ""What astounds me,"" she retorted, ""is that you should have thought it astounding. Funny sort of girls you must know if my behaviour surprises you."" ""I am extremely sorry if I annoyed you, but even now I cannot say that I think I was in the wrong. What I feel is that all that sort of thing is of no importance, really, and I can't understand a girl who could so easily give pleasure not consenting to do so. Let us be quite clear about it,"" I went on, throwing a sop of sorts to her moral scruples, as I recalled how she and her friends had scarified the girl who went about with the actress Lea. ""I don't mean to say for a moment that a girl can behave exactly as she likes, or that there's no such thing as immorality. Take, let me see now, yes, what you were saying the other day about a girl who is staying at Balbec and her relations with an actress; I call that degrading, so degrading that I feel sure it must all have been made up by the girl's enemies, and that there can't be any truth in the story. It strikes me as improbable, impossible. But to let a friend kiss you, and go farther than that even—since you say that I am your friend…"" ""So you are, but I have had friends before now , I have known lots of young men who were every bit as friendly, I can assure you. There wasn't one of them would ever have dared to do a thing like that. They knew they'd get their ears boxed if they tried it on. Besides, they never dreamed of trying, we would shake hands in an open, friendly sort of way, like good pals, but there was never a word said about kissing, and yet we weren't any the less friends for that. Why, if it's my friendship you are after, you've nothing to complain of; I must be jolly fond of you to forgive you. But I'm sure you don't care two straws about me, really. Own up now , it's Andrée you're in love with. After all, you're quite right; she is ever so much prettier than I am, and perfectly charming! Oh! You men!"" Despite my recent disappointment, these words so frankly uttered, by giving me a great respect for Albertine, made a very pleasant impression on me. And perhaps this impression was to have serious and vexatious consequences for me later on, for it was round it that there began to form that feeling almost of brotherly intimacy, that moral core which was always to remain at the heart of my love for Albertine. A feeling of this sort may be the cause of the keenest pain. For in order really to suffer at the hands of a woman one must have believed in her completely. For the moment, that embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, was left embedded in me like a stepping–stone in a stream. It could have availed nothing, by itself, against my happiness if it had remained there without growing, in an inertia which it was to retain the following year, and still more during the final weeks of this first visit to Balbec. It dwelt in me like one of those foreign bodies which it would be wiser when all is said to expel, but which we leave where they are without disturbing them, so harmless for the present does their weakness, their isolation amid a strange environment render them.","What was sure was that she was upset at not having been nice to me, and that she gave me a little golden pencil, acting on that virtuous perversity of people who are moved by the liking we inspire in them to do us a favour, not the one we would prefer, but some other: a critic, rather than writing a good review on a novelist, takes him out to dinner; a duchess, instead of including a social climber in her theatre party, lends him her box for an evening when she stays at home. Thus conscience, in those who do little and who could do nothing, makes them do something more. I told Albertine that I was very pleased by her gift of a pencil, but that I would have been better pleased if she had let me kiss her on the evening when she stayed at the hotel: ‘It would have made me so happy! What difference could it have made to you? I’m surprised you didn’t want to. – Well, I’m surprised you’re surprised! she replied. What sort of girls must you be familiar with to be surprised at what I did? – I’m sorry if I upset you, but I can’t say, even now, that I think what I did was wrong. If you ask me, it’s the sort of thing which is utterly unimportant, and I can’t see why a girl who could so easily be nice to someone won’t do it. Mind you, I added, the memory of the girl who was friendly with the actress Léa, and the odium heaped on her by Albertine and her group of friends, making me concede a sort of semi-agreement with her ideas of morality, I don’t mean girls can do just anything, or that there’s no such thing as immorality. I mean, that Balbec girl you were all talking about the other day, who’s supposed to be carrying on with that actress , well I think that’s just disgusting – so disgusting, actually, that I can only assume it’s not true, but was invented by the girl’s enemies. It just strikes me as improbable, impossible in fact. But letting a chap that you like kiss you, and go even further, since you say you like me … – I do! But I’ve liked other chaps too. Believe you me, I’ve known other boys who were just as fond of me as you are. But there wasn’t one of them who would’ve dared do any such thing! They knew perfectly well they’d have got a good slap in the face! Anyway, the thought never entered their heads – we just shook hands in the usual way, like ordinary good friends. No one would ever have thought of kissing, but that didn’t stop us being close friends. Look, if you really want us to be friends, then you can count yourself lucky – I must be pretty fond of you to forgive you like this. In any case, I’m sure you’re just having me on! Andrée’s the one you really like – admit it! And I’m sure you’re right – she’s much nicer than me, and she’s beautiful! Oh, you men!’ That Albertine should speak so openly was balm to my recent hurt feelings; and this gave me a high opinion of her. The consolation I drew from her words may even have had, much later, far-reaching and grave consequences for me, because it contributed to the development of a sort of family feeling for her, a moral core which gathered in the centre of my love for her, and was to be for ever inseparable from it. Such a feeling can be the harbinger of acute suffering: for a woman to cause us great pain, there must have been a time when we trusted her implicitly. For the time being, this embryo of friendliness, of moral esteem, lay latent within me, a toothing stone for a future extension. Without that growth to come, if it had remained in the inert state in which it still was the following year, let alone during the last weeks of my first stay in Balbec, it would have been unavailing against my happiness. It lived in me like a quiescent parasite, which it would really be wiser to be rid of, but which one leaves to its own devices, undisturbed, harmless for the moment, weak and lost as it is in the further reaches of a foreign self."
"La ressemblance était des plus vagues, mais on eût dit que ce fût un titre. On répétait : « Bloch ? lequel ? le duc d’Aumale ? » Comme on dit : « La princesse Murat ? laquelle ? la Reine (de Naples) ? » Un certain nombre d’autres infimes indices achevaient de lui donner aux yeux du cousinage une prétendue distinction. N’allant pas jusqu’à avoir une voiture, M. Bloch louait à certains jours une victoria découverte à deux chevaux de la Compagnie et traversait le bois de Boulogne, mollement étendu de travers, deux doigts sur la tempe, deux autres sous le menton et si les gens qui ne le connaissaient pas le trouvaient à cause de cela « faiseur d’embarras », on était persuadé dans la famille que pour le chic, l’oncle Salomon aurait pu en remontrer à Gramont-Caderousse. Il était de ces personnes qui quand elles meurent et à cause d’une table commune avec le rédacteur en chef de cette feuille dans un restaurant des boulevards, sont qualifiés de physionomie bien connue des Parisiens, par la Chronique mondaine du Radical. M. Bloch nous dit à Saint-Loup et à moi que Bergotte savait si bien pourquoi lui, M. Bloch, ne le saluait pas, que dès qu’il l’apercevait au théâtre ou au cercle, il fuyait son regard. Saint-Loup rougit, car il réfléchit que ce cercle ne pouvait pas être le Jockey dont son père avait été président. D’autre part ce devait être un cercle relativement fermé, car M. Bloch avait dit que Bergotte n’y serait plus reçu aujourd’hui. Aussi est-ce en tremblant de « sous-estimer l’adversaire » que Saint-Loup demanda si ce cercle était le cercle de la rue Royale, lequel était jugé « déclassant » par la famille de Saint-Loup et où il savait qu’étaient reçus certains Israélites. « Non, répondit M. Bloch d’un air négligent, fier et honteux, c’est un petit cercle, mais beaucoup plus agréable, le Cercle des Ganaches. On y juge sévèrement la galerie. – Est-ce que sir Rufus Israël n’en est pas président ? » demanda Bloch fils à son père, pour lui fournir l’occasion d’un mensonge honorable et sans se douter que ce financier n’avait pas le même prestige aux yeux de Saint-Loup qu’aux siens. En réalité, il y avait au Cercle des Ganaches non point sir Rufus Israël, mais un de ses employés. Mais comme il était fort bien avec le patron, il avait à sa disposition des cartes du grand financier, et en donnait une à M. Bloch, quand celui-ci partait en voyage sur une ligne dont sir Rufus était administrateur, ce qui faisait dire au père Bloch : « Je vais passer au cercle demander une recommandation de sir Rufus. » Et la carte lui permettait d’éblouir les chefs de train. Les demoiselles Bloch furent plus intéressées par Bergotte et revenant à lui au lieu de poursuivre sur les « Ganaches », la cadette demanda à son frère du ton le plus sérieux du monde car elle croyait qu’il n’existait pas au monde pour désigner les gens de talent d’autres expressions que celles qu’il employait : « Est-ce un coco vraiment étonnant, ce Bergotte ? Est-il de la catégorie des grands bonshommes, des cocos comme Villiers ou Catulle ? – Je l’ai rencontré à plusieurs générales, dit M. Nissim Bernard. Il est gauche, c’est une espèce de Schlemihl. » Cette allusion au conte de Chamisso n’avait rien de bien grave, mais l’épithète de Schlemihl faisait partie de ce dialecte mi-allemand, mi-juif, dont l’emploi ravissait M. Bloch dans l’intimité, mais qu’il trouvait vulgaire et déplacé devant des étrangers. Aussi jeta-t-il un regard sévère sur son oncle. « Il a du talent, dit Bloch. – Ah ! fit gravement sa sœur comme pour dire que dans ces conditions j’étais excusable. – Tous les écrivains ont du talent, dit avec mépris M. Bloch père. – Il paraît même, dit son fils en levant sa fourchette et en plissant ses yeux d’un air diaboliquement ironique, qu’il va se présenter à l’Académie. – Allons donc ! il n’a pas un bagage suffisant, répondit M. Bloch le père qui ne semblait pas avoir pour l’Académie le mépris de son fils et de ses filles. Il n’a pas le calibre nécessaire. – D’ailleurs l’Académie est un salon et Bergotte ne jouit d’aucune surface », déclara l’oncle à héritage de Mme Bloch, personnage inoffensif et doux dont le nom de Bernard eût peut-être à lui seul éveillé les dons de diagnostic de mon grand-père, mais eût paru insuffisamment en harmonie avec un visage qui semblait rapporté du palais de Darius et reconstitué par Mme Dieulafoy, si, choisi par quelque amateur désireux de donner un couronnement oriental à cette figure de Suse, ce prénom de Nissim n’avait fait planer au-dessus d’elle les ailes de quelque taureau androcéphale de Khorsabad. Mais M. Bloch ne cessait d’insulter son oncle, soit qu’il fût excité par la bonhomie sans défense de son souffre-douleur, soit que, la villa étant payée par M. Nissim Bernard, le bénéficiaire voulût montrer qu’il gardait son indépendance et surtout qu’il ne cherchait pas par des cajoleries à s’assurer l’héritage à venir du richard. Celui-ci était surtout froissé qu’on le traitât si grossièrement devant le maître d’hôtel. Il murmura une phrase inintelligible où on distinguait seulement : « Quand les Meschorès sont là. » Meschorès désigne dans la Bible le serviteur de Dieu. Entre eux les Bloch s’en servaient pour désigner les domestiques et en étaient toujours égayés, parce que leur certitude de n’être pas compris ni des chrétiens ni des domestiques eux-mêmes exaltait chez M. Nissim Bernard et M. Bloch leur double particularisme de « maîtres » et de « juifs ». Mais cette dernière cause de satisfaction en devenait une de mécontentement quand il y avait du monde. Alors M. Bloch entendant son oncle dire « Meschorès » trouvait qu’il laissait trop paraître son côté oriental, de même qu’une cocotte qui invite ses amies avec des gens comme il faut est irritée si elles font allusion à leur métier de cocotte, ou emploient des mots malsonnants. Aussi, bien loin que la prière de son oncle produisît quelque effet sur M. Bloch, celui-ci, hors de lui, ne put plus se contenir. Il ne perdit plus une occasion d’invectiver le malheureux oncle. « Naturellement, quand il y a quelque bêtise prudhommesque à dire, on peut être sûr que vous ne la ratez pas. Vous seriez le premier à lui lécher les pieds s’il était là », cria M. Bloch tandis que M. Nissim Bernard attristé inclinait vers son assiette la barbe annelée du roi Sargon. Mon camarade depuis qu’il portait la sienne qu’il avait aussi crépue et bleutée ressemblait beaucoup à son grand-oncle.","The resemblance was very vague, but it looked like a title. We kept repeating: “Bloch? which ? the Duke of Aumale? As they say: ""Princess Murat?"" which ? the Queen (of Naples)? A certain number of other tiny clues finished giving him a supposed distinction in the eyes of the cousins. Not going so far as to have a carriage, M. Bloch rented on certain days an uncovered victoria with two horses from the Company and crossed the Bois de Boulogne, limply stretched askew, two fingers on his temple, two others under his chin. and if people who didn't know him thought he was an ""embarrassment"" because of that, we were convinced in the family that for the chic, Uncle Salomon could have shown it to Gramont-Caderousse. He was one of those people who when they die and because of a joint table with the editor of this sheet in a restaurant on the boulevards, are described as a face well known to Parisians, by the Chronique mondaine du Radical. M. Bloch told Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, did not greet him, that as soon as he saw him at the theater or at the club, he avoided his gaze. Saint-Loup blushed, for he reflected that this circle could not be the Jockey of which his father had been president. On the other hand, it must have been a relatively closed circle, because M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would no longer be received there today. It was therefore while trembling at ""underestimating the adversary"" that Saint-Loup asked if this circle was the circle of the rue Royale, which was considered ""downgrading"" by the Saint-Loup family and where he knew that some Israelites were received. ""No,"" replied M. Bloch with a careless, proud, and ashamed air, ""it's a small circle, but much nicer, the Cercle des Ganaches."" The gallery is judged severely there. ""Isn't Sir Rufus Israel president?"" Bloch Jr. asked his father, to give him an opportunity for an honorable lie and without suspecting that this financier did not have the same prestige in Saint-Loup's eyes as in his own. In reality, there was not Sir Rufus Israel at the Cercle des Ganaches, but one of his employees. But as he was on good terms with the boss, he had cards of the great financier at his disposal, and gave one to M. Bloch, when the latter went on a journey on a line of which Sir Rufus was administrator, which made one say to Father Bloch: ""I am going to go to the club to ask for a recommendation from Sir Rufus."" And the map allowed him to dazzle the conductors. The Bloch ladies were more interested in Bergotte and coming back to him instead of continuing on the ""Ganaches"", the youngest asked her brother in the most serious tone in the world because she believed that he did not exist in the world to designate the talented people with other expressions than those he used: ""Is this a really astonishing coco, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of big men, cocos like Villiers or Catulle? “I met him at several rehearsals,” said M. Nissim Bernard. He is clumsy, he is a kind of Schlemihl. This allusion to the tale of Chamisso was not very serious, but the epithet of Schlemihl was part of this half-German, half-Jewish dialect, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in private, but which he found it vulgar and out of place in front of strangers. So he cast a stern look on his uncle. ""He's got talent,"" Bloch said. – Ah! said her sister gravely, as if to say that under these conditions I was excusable. ""All writers have talent,"" said M. Bloch scornfully. “It even appears,” said his son, raising his fork and squinting his eyes with a devilishly ironic air, “that he is going to present himself at the Academy. - Let's go then! he does not have a sufficient background, replied M. Bloch the father, who did not seem to have the contempt of his son and his daughters for the Academy. He does not have the necessary caliber. ""Besides, the Academy is a salon and Bergotte enjoys no space,"" declared Madame Bloch's inherited uncle, an inoffensive and gentle character whose name Bernard would perhaps have awakened the gifts of diagnosis of my grandfather, but would have seemed insufficiently in harmony with a face which seemed brought back from the palace of Darius and reconstituted by Madame Dieulafoy, if, chosen by some amateur wishing to give an oriental crowning to this figure of Susa, this first name of Nissim had made the wings of some male-headed bull from Khorsabad hover above her. But M. Bloch never ceased to insult his uncle, either because he was excited by the defenseless good nature of his whipping boy, or because, the villa being paid for by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wanted to show that he kept his independence and above all that he did not seek by cajoling to ensure the future inheritance of the richard. The latter was especially offended at being treated so rudely in front of the butler. He murmured an unintelligible sentence in which one could only make out: ""When the Meschores are there."" Meschores designates in the Bible the servant of God. Among themselves the Blochs used it to designate the servants and were always amused by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves exalted in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their double particularism. of ""masters"" and ""Jews"". But this last cause of satisfaction became one of discontent when there were people. So Mr. Bloch, hearing his uncle say ""Meschores"", found that he let his oriental side show too much, just as a cocotte who invites her friends over with decent people is irritated if they allude to their job as a cocotte, or use misleading words. Thus, far from his uncle's prayer having any effect on M. Bloch, the latter, beside himself, could contain himself no longer. He lost no more opportunity to invective the unfortunate uncle. “Of course, when there is some prudhommesque nonsense to say, we can be sure that you do not miss it. You'd be the first to lick his feet if he was there,” cried Mr. Bloch as a saddened Mr. Nissim Bernard tilted King Sargon's ringed beard to his plate. My comrade since he wore his that he had also frizzy and bluish looked a lot like his great-uncle.","The resemblance was the faintest, but you would have said that it conferred a title. When he was mentioned, it would always be: ""Bloch? Which one? The Duc d'Aumale?"" as people say ""Princesse Murat? Which one? The Queen (of Naples)? "" And there were certain other minute marks which combined to give him, in the eyes of the cousinhood, an acknowledged claim to distinction. Not going the length of having a carriage of his own, M. Bloch used on special occasions to hire an open victoria with a pair of horses from the Company, and would drive through the Bois de Boulogne, his body sprawling limply from side to side, two fingers pressed to his brow, other two supporting his chin, and if people who did not know him concluded that he was an 'old nuisance,' they were all convinced, in the family, that for smartness Uncle Solomon could have taught Gramont– Caderousse a thing or two. He was one of those people who when they die, because for years they have shared a table in a restaurant on the boulevard with its news–editor, are described as ""well known Paris figures"" in the social column of the Radical. M. Bloch told Saint–Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, always cut him that as soon as he caught sight of him, at the theatre or in the club, he avoided his eye. Saint– Loup blushed, for it had occurred to him that this club could not be the Jockey, of which his father had been chairman. On the other hand it must be a fairly exclusive club, for M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would never have got into it if he had come up now. So it was not without the fear that he might be 'underrating his adversary' that Saint–Loup asked whether the club in question were the Rue Royale, which was considered 'lowering' by his own family, and to which he knew that certain Israelites had been admitted. "" No,"" replied M. Bloch in a tone at once careless, proud and ashamed, ""it is a small club, but far more pleasant than a big one, the Ganaches. We're very strict there, don't you know."" ""Isn't Sir Rufus Israels the chairman?"" Bloch junior asked his father, so as to give him the opportunity for a glorious lie, never suspecting that the financier had not the same eminence in Saint– Loup's eyes as in his. The fact of the matter was that the Ganaches club boasted not Sir Rufus Israels but one of his staff. But as this man was on the best of terms with his employer, he had at his disposal a stock of the financier's cards, and would give one to M. Bloch whenever he wished to travel on a line of which Sir Rufus was a director, the result of which was that old Bloch would say: ""I'm just going round to the Club to ask Sir Rufus for a line to the Company."" And the card enabled him to dazzle the guards on the trains. The Misses Bloch were more interested in Bergotte and, reverting to him rather than pursue the subject of the Ganaches, the youngest asked her brother, in the most serious tone imaginable, for she believed that there existed in the world, for the designation of men of talent, no other terms than those which he was in the habit of using: ""Is he really an amazing good egg, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of the great lads, good eggs like Villiers and Catullus?"" ""I've met him several times at dress rehearsals,"" said M. Nissim Bernard. "" He is an uncouth creature, a sort of Schlemihl. "" There was nothing very serious in this allusion to Chamisso's story but the epithet 'Schlemihl' formed part of that dialect, half–German, half–Jewish, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in the family circle, but struck him as vulgar and out of place before strangers. And so he cast a reproving glance at his uncle. "" He has talent,"" said Bloch. "" Ah!"" His sister sighed gravely, as though to imply that in that case there was some excuse for me. "" All writers have talent,"" said M. Bloch scornfully. ""In fact it appears,"" went on his son, raising his fork, and screwing up his eyes with an air of impish irony, ""that he is going to put up for the Academy."" ""Go on. He hasn't enough to shew them,"" replied his father, who seemed not to have for the Academy the same contempt as his son and daughters. "" He's not big enough."" ""Besides, the Academy is a salon, and Bergotte has no polish,"" declared the uncle (whose heiress Mme. Bloch was), a mild and inoffensive person whose surname, Bernard, might perhaps by itself have quickened my grandfather's powers of diagnosis, but would have appeared too little in harmony with a face which looked as if it had been brought back from Darius's palace and restored by Mme. Dieulafoy, had not (chosen by some collector desirous of giving a crowning touch of orientalism to this figure from Susa) his first name, Nissim, stretched out above it the pinions of an androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. But M. Bloch never stopped insulting his uncle, whether it was that he was excited by the unresisting good–humour of his butt, or that the rent of the villa being paid by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wished to shew that he kept his independence, and, more important still, that he was not seeking by flattery to make sure of the rich inheritance to come. What most hurt the old man was being treated so rudely in front of the manservant. He murmured an unintelligible sentence of which all that could be made out was: ""when the meschores are in the room. "" 'Meschores,' in the Bible, means 'the servant of God.' In the family circle the Blochs used the word when they referred to their own servants, and were always exhilarated by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves enhanced in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their twofold distinction of being 'masters' and at the same time 'Jews.' But this latter source of satisfaction became a source of displeasure when there was 'company.' At such times M. Bloch, hearing his uncle say 'meschores,' felt that he was making his oriental side too prominent, just as a light–of–love who has invited some of her sisters to meet her respectable friends is annoyed if they allude to their profession or use words that do not sound quite nice. Therefore, so far from his uncle's request's producing any effect on M. Bloch, he, beside himself with rage, could contain himself no longer. He let no opportunity pass of scarifying his wretched uncle. ""Of course, when there is a chance of saying anything stupid, one can be quite certain that you won't miss it. You would be the first to lick his boots if he were in the room!"" shouted M. Bloch, while M. Nissim Bernard in sorrow lowered over his plate the ringleted beard of King Sargon. My friend, when he began to grow his beard, which also was blue–black and crimped, became very like his great–uncle.","This resemblance was remote; yet it seemed to be viewed as a sort of title. People said, ‘Which Bloch do you mean – the Duc d’Aumale?’ as they might say, ‘Which Princesse Murat do you mean – the Queen of Naples?’ One or two other minute features were enough to make all the kith and kin exclaim at how distinguished he looked. Though his style of life did not run to a carriage, on certain days M. Bloch would hire an open victoria and pair, and have himself driven through the Bois de Boulogne, nonchalantly sprawling, with two fingers at his temple and two under his chin; and though passers-by who did not know him may have thought he was ‘just a joker’, the whole family knew that, when it came to ‘the high life’, Uncle Salomon could show a thing or two to Gramont-Caderousse71 himself. He was one of those men who, when they die, are described in the social column of Le Radical, because they used to eat in a restaurant on the boulevards at the same table as the editor of that little newspaper, as ‘a personality well known to Parisians’. M. Bloch said to Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte was well aware why he, M. Bloch, never greeted him, that Bergotte averted his eyes as soon as he caught sight of him at the theatre or at the club. Saint-Loup started to blush, at the thought that such a club could not possibly be the Jockey Club, of which his father had been the chairman. Yet it had to be quite an exclusive one, as M. Bloch had just said that, nowadays, Bergotte would not be elected to it. So, with some apprehension, in case he was ‘underestimating the opponent’, Saint-Loup asked whether the club in question was not the Cercle de la rue Royale, which was a club deemed to be ‘beyond the pale’ by his family, to which he knew certain Jews had been elected. ‘ No, replied M. Bloch with an air of negligence, pride and shame, it’s a small club, but much more enjoyable than that one: the Old Duffers’ Club. We’re very select, you know. – Isn’t Sir Rufus Israel the Chairman?’ the younger Bloch asked, to give his father the opportunity to tell a lie which would put him in a good light, and quite without realizing that the financier’s name did not have the same prestige for Saint-Loup as it had for him. In point of fact, the Old Duffers’ Club counted among its members, not Sir Rufus Israel, but one of his employees. This man, being on good terms with his employer, carried about a supply of cards bearing the financier’s name, one of which he would give to M. Bloch whenever the latter was about to travel with a railway company of which Sir Rufus was a director. M. Bloch would say, ‘I must look in at the club and get a recommendation from Sir Rufus.’ Once on the train, the card enabled him to impress the guard. Mesdemoiselles Bloch being more interested in Bergotte than in pursuing the subject of the Old Duffers, the youngest of them asked her brother in a voice that was completely serious (for she was under the impression that the only way to speak of talented men was to use her brother’s repertoire of expressions), ‘Is this Bergotte customer really an outstanding sort of a cove? I mean, is he one of your Villiers or your Catulles,72 really big customers like that? – I’ve met him at a few first nights, said M. Nissim Bernard. He’s awkward, a sort of Peter Schlemihl. ’73 M. Bloch had nothing against this reference to the Count von Chamisso; but the mention of a word like ‘Schlemihl’, though it belonged to the sort of semi-German, semi-Jewish dialect which delighted him within the family circle, he thought was vulgar and out of keeping when spoken in front of strangers. He shot a dark look at his uncle. ‘ He does have some talent, Bloch said. – Oh, I see, the sister replied, in a very sober voice, as though meaning that in that case I was to be excused. – All writers have some talent, M. Bloch senior said scornfully. – It’s even being said,’ said the son, brandishing his fork and screwing his eyes into a diabolically ironic expression, ‘that he’s going to present himself for election to the Académie française! – Oh, for goodness sake! The man’s a light-weight!’ replied M. Bloch senior, who seemed not to hold the Académie in such low esteem as his son and daughters. ‘He doesn’t have the necessary calibre. – In any case, the Académie is a salon and Bergotte enjoys too little credit,’ pronounced Mme Bloch’s uncle, a harmless and gentle individual with money to leave, whose surname, Bernard, might have been enough to stimulate my grandfather’s diagnostic gift, though it might also have seemed insufficiently in harmony with a face which could have been brought back from the palace of Darius and recomposed by Mme Dieulafoy,74 had it not been preceded by the name of Nissim, chosen by some expert wishing to crown this visage from Susa in an aptly Oriental way, by spreading above it the wingspan of some androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. M. Bloch senior would often insult this uncle, either because he was stimulated to pick on him by the man’s simple but vulnerable good nature, or because, the villa being rented in the name of M. Nissim Bernard, he wanted to show that, though his beneficiary, he was not beholden to him in any way, and especially that he was not trying to ingratiate himself with the aim of inheriting all that money when the time came. M. Nissim Bernard was upset mainly at being treated rudely in the presence of the butler. He murmured something unintelligible, in which all one could make out was, ‘When the Meschores are here.’ In the Bible, ‘Meschores’ means the ‘servant of God’. Among themselves, the Blochs used the word with the meaning of ‘the servants’ and they had great fun in using it: their belief that neither Gentiles nor indeed their servants understood the allusion quickened for both M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch senior the gratification they derived from their double status of ‘masters’ and ‘Jews’. However, the latter satisfaction turned into dissatisfaction when guests were present. When M. Bloch heard his uncle say ‘Meschores’, he felt he was drawing too much attention to his Easternness, as a courtesan entertaining some of her likes along with more respectable people will be annoyed if the loose women raise the subject of their profession or use objectionable language. So, rather than mollifying M. Bloch, his uncle’s murmur of complaint irritated him beyond measure; and he lost no opportunity of berating the poor man. ‘Naturally, when there’s some pompous stupidity to utter, one may be sure you will do it. You would be the first to lick Bergotte’s boots if he was here!’ M. Bloch exclaimed, while M. Nissim Bernard lowered the dense locks of the beard of King Sargon towards his plate. Young Bloch too now wore a beard, which was also frizzed and blue-black, bringing out in him a close resemblance to his great-uncle."
"M. de Norpois pour contribuer lui aussi à l’agrément du repas nous servit diverses histoires dont il régalait fréquemment ses collègues de carrière, tantôt en citant une période ridicule dite par un homme politique coutumier du fait et qui les faisait longues et pleines d’images incohérentes, tantôt telle formule lapidaire d’un diplomate plein d’atticisme. Mais, à vrai dire, le critérium qui distinguait pour lui ces deux ordres de phrases ne ressemblait en rien à celui que j’appliquais à la littérature. Bien des nuances m’échappaient ; les mots qu’il récitait en s’esclaffant ne me paraissaient pas très différents de ceux qu’il trouvait remarquables. Il appartenait au genre d’hommes qui pour les œuvres que j’aimais eût dit : « Alors, vous comprenez ? moi j’avoue que je ne comprends pas, je ne suis pas initié », mais j’aurais pu lui rendre la pareille, je ne saisissais pas l’esprit ou la sottise, l’éloquence ou l’enflure qu’il trouvait dans une réplique ou dans un discours, et l’absence de toute raison perceptible pour quoi ceci était mal et ceci bien faisait que cette sorte de littérature m’était plus mystérieuse, me semblait plus obscure qu’aucune. Je démêlai seulement que répéter ce que tout le monde pensait n’était pas en politique une marque d’infériorité mais de supériorité. Quand M. de Norpois se servait de certaines expressions qui traînaient dans les journaux et les prononçait avec force, on sentait qu’elles devenaient un acte par le seul fait qu’il les avait employées, et un acte qui susciterait des commentaires.","M. de Norpois, to also contribute to the enjoyment of the meal, served us various stories with which he frequently regaled his career colleagues, sometimes quoting a ridiculous period told by a politician accustomed to the fact and which made them long and full of incoherent images, sometimes such a pithy formula of a diplomat full of Atticism. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which distinguished for him these two orders of sentences was in no way similar to that which I applied to literature. Many nuances escaped me; the words he recited with laughter did not strike me as very different from those he found remarkable. He belonged to the kind of man who for the works that I liked would have said: “So, you understand? I confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated"", but I could have returned the favor, I did not grasp the wit or the stupidity, the eloquence or the swelling that he found in a line or in a speech, and the absence of any discernible reason why this was wrong and this right made this kind of literature more mysterious to me, more obscure to me than any. I only figured out that repeating what everyone thought was not a mark of inferiority in politics but of superiority. When M. de Norpois used certain expressions which were found in the newspapers and pronounced them with force, one felt that they became an act by the mere fact that he had used them, and an act which would arouse commentaries.","M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in ""the career,"" quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: ""So you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;"" but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one's being badly and the other's well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain expressions which were 'common form' in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment.","So as to contribute his fair share to the enjoyment of the meal, M. de Norpois now served up for us several stories which his diplomatic colleagues were familiar with, some of them featuring the sesquipedalianism of a certain politician known for his preposterous utterances larded with mixed metaphors, others featuring the epigrammatic brevity of a diplomat who was a master of elegant atticism. It was clear that M. de Norpois’s judgment of these two types of sentence was based on a criterion which was utterly unlike the one I applied to literature. I missed many niceties in his stories: I could see little difference between the clumsy sentences which he accompanied with guffaws, and the others which he thought were so fine. He was the kind of man who would have said of the books I liked, ‘So you fancy this sort of stuff, do you? Personally, I have to say I don’t see much in it , I’m not one of the initiated.’ But I could have said the same thing to him: in a statement or a speech, I could not see what he saw as witty or what he thought was stupid, what was eloquence and what was bombast; and the lack of any apparent reason why one was good and the other bad meant that these literary standards struck me as most mysterious and obscure. The only deduction I could draw was that, in politics, it was a mark of superiority rather than inferiority to repeat what everybody else thought. Each time M. de Norpois used certain expressions, which were as trite as the newspapers in which he read them, and which he spoke with emphasis, one could sense that, by virtue of having been uttered by him, they became an act, and that this act would not go unnoticed."
"– Je ne peux pas vous dire comme Mme Blandais m’agace en regardant ces gens-là comme cela, dit le bâtonnier au président. Je voudrais pouvoir lui donner une gifle. C’est comme cela qu’on donne de l’importance à cette canaille qui naturellement ne demande qu’à ce que l’on s’occupe d’elle. Dites donc à son mari de l’avertir que c’est ridicule ; moi je ne sors plus avec eux s’ils ont l’air de faire attention aux déguisés.","""I can't tell you how Mrs. Blandais irritates me by looking at these people like that,"" said the President of the Bar. I wish I could give him a slap. This is how we give importance to this scoundrel who naturally only asks that we take care of her. Tell her husband to warn her that it is ridiculous; I don't go out with them anymore if they seem to pay attention to disguises.","""I can't tell you how angry Mme. Blandais makes me when she stares at those people like that,"" said the barrister to the chief magistrate, ""I feel I want to slap her. That is just the way to make the wretches appear important; and of course that's the very thing they want, that people should take an interest in them. Do ask her husband to tell her what a fool she's making of herself. I swear I won't go out with them again if they stop and gape at those masqueraders.""","‘I wish I could tell you how it irritates me when Mme Blandais stares at those people like that, the bâtonnier said to the First President. I feel like giving her a good slap across the face. It’s people like her that make people take an interest in riff-raff like that. And of course riff-raff love it when people take an interest in them. Tell her husband, would you, to tell her it’s ridiculous. I for one will certainly not be going out with them again if they look as though they’re fascinated by a couple in fancy dress!’"
"J’avais pensé qu’en nous invitant ainsi chez sa tante, que je ne doutais pas qu’il eût prévenue, M. de Charlus eût voulu réparer l’impolitesse qu’il m’avait témoignée pendant la promenade du matin. Mais quand, arrivé dans le salon de Mme de Villeparisis, je voulus saluer le neveu de celle-ci, j’eus beau tourner autour de lui qui, d’une voix aiguë, racontait une histoire assez malveillante pour un de ses parents, je ne pus pas attraper son regard ; je me décidai à lui dire bonjour, et assez fort, pour l’avertir de ma présence, mais je compris qu’il l’avait remarquée, car avant même qu’aucun mot ne fût sorti de mes lèvres, au moment où je m’inclinais je vis ses deux doigts tendus pour que je les serrasse, sans qu’il eût tourné les yeux ou interrompu la conversation. Il m’avait évidemment vu, sans le laisser paraître, et je m’aperçus alors que ses yeux, qui n’étaient jamais fixés sur l’interlocuteur, se promenaient perpétuellement dans toutes les directions, comme ceux de certains animaux effrayés, ou ceux de ces marchands en plein air qui, tandis qu’ils débitent leur boniment et exhibent leur marchandise illicite, scrutent, sans pourtant tourner la tête, les différents points de l’horizon par où pourrait venir la police. Cependant j’étais un peu étonné de voir que Mme de Villeparisis, heureuse de nous voir venir, ne semblait pas s’y être attendue, je le fus plus encore d’entendre M. de Charlus dire à ma grand’mère : « Ah ! c’est une très bonne idée que vous avez eue de venir, c’est charmant, n’est-ce pas, ma tante ? » Sans doute avait-il remarqué la surprise de celle-ci à notre entrée et pensait-il en homme habitué à donner le ton, le « la », qu’il lui suffisait pour changer cette surprise en joie d’indiquer qu’il en éprouvait lui-même, que c’était bien le sentiment que notre venue devait exciter. En quoi il calculait bien, car Mme de Villeparisis qui comptait fort son neveu et savait combien il était difficile de lui plaire, parut soudain avoir trouvé à ma grand’mère de nouvelles qualités et ne cessa de lui faire fête. Mais je ne pouvais comprendre que M. de Charlus eût oublié en quelques heures l’invitation si brève, mais en apparence si intentionnelle, si préméditée qu’il m’avait adressée le matin même, et qu’il appelât « bonne idée » de ma grand’mère, une idée qui était toute de lui. Avec un scrupule de précision que je gardai jusqu’à l’âge où je compris que ce n’est pas en la lui demandant qu’on apprend la vérité sur l’intention qu’un homme a eue et que le risque d’un malentendu qui passera probablement inaperçu est moindre que celui d’une naïve insistance : « Mais monsieur, lui dis-je, vous vous rappelez bien, n’est-ce pas, que c’est vous qui m’avez demandé que nous vinssions ce soir ? » Aucun son, aucun mouvement ne trahirent que M. de Charlus eût entendu ma question. Ce que voyant je la répétai comme les diplomates ou ces jeunes gens brouillés qui mettent une bonne volonté inlassable et vaine à obtenir des éclaircissements que l’adversaire est décidé à ne pas donner. M. de Charlus ne me répondit pas davantage. Il me sembla voir flotter sur ses lèvres le sourire de ceux qui de très haut jugent les caractères et les éducations.","I had thought that by inviting us thus to his aunt's, whom I had no doubt he had informed, M. de Charlus wished to make up for the rudeness he had shown me during the morning's walk. But when, when I arrived in Madame de Villeparisis's drawing-room, I wanted to greet her nephew, I tried to circle around him who, in a high-pitched voice, was telling a rather malevolent story for one of his relatives. couldn't catch his eye; I made up my mind to say hello to him, and loud enough to alert him to my presence, but I understood that he had noticed it, for even before a word had left my lips, at the moment when I As I bowed I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to squeeze, without his having turned his eyes or interrupted the conversation. He had obviously seen me, without letting it appear, and I then noticed that his eyes, which were never fixed on the interlocutor, were perpetually wandering in all directions, like those of certain frightened animals, or those of those open-air merchants who, while they spout their spiel and exhibit their illicit merchandise, scrutinize, without however turning their heads, the different points of the horizon from which the police might come. However, I was a little surprised to see that Madame de Villeparisis, happy to see us coming, did not seem to have expected it. I was even more surprised to hear Monsieur de Charlus say to my grandmother: ""Ah! ! It's a very good idea that you had to come, it's charming, isn't it, my aunt? No doubt he had noticed her surprise when we entered and thought, as a man accustomed to setting the tone, the ""the"", that it was enough for him to change this surprise into joy to indicate that he felt himself, that it was indeed the feeling that our arrival was to excite. In which he calculated well, for Madame de Villeparisis, who had great regard for her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, suddenly seemed to have found new qualities in my grandmother and never ceased to make him happy. But I could not understand how M. de Charlus should have forgotten in a few hours the invitation so brief, but apparently so intentional, so premeditated that he had addressed to me that very morning, and which he called ""a good idea"" to my grandmother, an idea that was entirely his. With a scruple of precision that I kept until the age when I understood that it is not by asking him that one learns the truth about the intention that a man had and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unnoticed is less than that of a naive insistence: ""But sir,"" I said to him, ""you remember very well, don't you, that it was you who asked me to come to this evening ? No sound, no movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had heard my question. Seeing this, I repeated it like the diplomats or those confused young people who use tireless and vain good will to obtain clarifications that the adversary has decided not to give. M. de Charlus did not answer me further. It seemed to me that I saw floating on his lips the smile of those who judge characters and educations from a very high place.","I had supposed that in thus inviting us to take tea with his aunt, whom I never doubted that he would have warned that we were coming, M. de Charlus wished to make amends for the impoliteness which he had shewn me during our walk that morning. But when, on our entering Mme. de Villeparisis's room, I attempted to greet her nephew, even although I walked right round him, while in shrill accents he was telling a somewhat spiteful story about one of his relatives, I did not succeed in catching his eye; I decided to say ""Good evening"" to him, and fairly loud, to warn him of my presence; but I realised that he had observed it, for before ever a word had passed my lips, just as I began to bow to him , I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to shake without his having turned to look at me or paused in his story. He had evidently seen me, without letting it appear that he had, and I noticed then that his eyes, which were never fixed on the person to whom he was speaking, strayed perpetually in all directions, like those of certain animals when they are frightened, or those of street hawkers who, while they are bawling their patter and displaying their illicit merchandise, keep a sharp look–out, though without turning their heads, on the different points of the horizon from any of which may appear, suddenly, the police. At the same time I was a little surprised to find that Mme. de Villeparisis, while glad to see us, did not seem to have been expecting us, and I was still more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother: "" Ah! that was a capital idea of yours to come and pay us a visit; charming of them, is it not, my dear aunt? "" No doubt he had noticed his aunt's surprise at our entry and thought, as a man accustomed to set the tone, to strike the right note, that it would be enough to transform that surprise into joy were he to shew that he himself felt it, that it was indeed the feeling which our arrival there ought to have prompted. In which he calculated wisely; for Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a high opinion of her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, appeared suddenly to have found new attractions in my grandmother and continued to make much of her. But I failed to understand how M. de Charlus could, in the space of a few hours, have forgotten the invitation—so curt but apparently so intentional, so premeditated—which he had addressed to me that same morning, or why he called a 'capital idea' on my grandmother's part an idea that had been entirely his own. With a scruple of accuracy which I retained until I had reached the age at which I realised that it is not by asking him questions that one learns the truth of what another man has had in his mind, and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unobserved is less than that which may come from a purblind insistence: ""But, sir,"" I reminded him, ""you remember, surely, that it was you who asked me if we would come in this evening?"" Not a sound, not a movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had so much as heard my question. Seeing which I repeated it, like a diplomat, or like young men after a misunderstanding who endeavour, with untiring and unrewarded zeal, to obtain an explanation which their adversary is determined not to give them. Still M. de Charlus answered me not a word. I seemed to see hovering upon his lips the smile of those who from a great height pass judgment on the characters and breeding of their inferiors.","I imagined that M. de Charlus, by inviting us to the suite of his aunt, whom he had no doubt consulted on the matter, intended to make amends for his discourtesy towards me during our walk that morning. Yet, when I arrived in Mme de Villeparisis’s sitting-room and attempted to greet her nephew, however hard I tried to catch his eye, I found it impossible: he just went on recounting in a shrill voice a rather disobliging story about one of his relatives. I decided to bid him good evening in a loud voice, so that he could be aware of my presence, but I soon saw that he had noticed me: just as I was about to bow, and before a word had passed my lips, I saw his two fingers extended for me to grasp, although he had not even glanced towards me or stopped talking. He had obviously seen me, but had given no hint of it, which was what made me realize that his eyes, which never met those of the person with whom he was speaking, were in constant motion in all directions, like the eyes of some animals when frightened, or those of pedlars who, while they recite their patter and display their illicit wares, manage to study all the points of the compass without so much as looking round, in case the police are about. I was also rather surprised to see that Mme de Villeparisis, though pleased to see us come in, had seemed not to have been expecting us; and then I was even more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother, ‘Well, how nice of you to think of dropping in like this! Isn’t it charming of them, Aunt?’ He must have noticed Mme de Villeparisis ’s expression of surprise at our arrival and thought, as a man accustomed to setting the tone, that to turn her surprise into pleasure all he had to do was make it plain that he himself took pleasure in the present circumstance, and that pleasure was an appropriate response. In this, he was a good judge, for Mme de Villeparisis, who greatly esteemed her nephew and knew how hard to please he was, instantly appeared to discover new qualities in my grandmother and welcomed her with open arms. It was difficult to accept that in the few hours which had passed since the morning, M. de Charlus could have forgotten an invitation which, though curtly delivered, had had all the appearances of being intentional and premeditated, and that he should now say my grandmother was just ‘dropping in’, when it was he who had asked us to come! With a respect for the facts, which I retained until the day when I realized that the truth about a man’s motive is not to be got from him by direct questioning, and that the damage likely to be done by a misunderstanding which could pass unnoticed may well be less than that done by naïve persistence, I said to him, ‘Surely you must remember, sir, that it was you who asked us to come this evening?’ He gave no hint, either by word or movement, of having heard me. So I repeated my question, like a diplomat or a youngster who, after a falling-out, tries and tries again, with indefatigable but futile good-will, to reason with someone who is determined not to be reasoned with. M. de Charlus persisted in not replying. I thought I could see a smile flicker about his lips: the smile of the man who looks down from a great height on the characters and manners of lesser men."
"Aimé, avant de se retirer, tint à me dire que Dreyfus était mille fois coupable. « On saura tout, me dit-il, pas cette année, mais l’année prochaine : c’est un monsieur très lié dans l’état-major qui me l’a dit. Je lui demandais si on ne se déciderait pas à tout découvrir tout de suite avant la fin de l’année. Il a posé sa cigarette », continua Aimé en mimant la scène et en secouant la tête et l’index comme avait fait son client voulant dire : il ne faut pas être trop exigeant. « Pas cette année, Aimé, qu’il m’a dit en me touchant à l’épaule, ce n’est pas possible. Mais à Pâques, oui ! » Et Aimé me frappa légèrement sur l’épaule en me disant : « Vous voyez, je vous montre exactement comme il a fait », soit qu’il fût flatté de cette familiarité d’un grand personnage, soit pour que je pusse mieux apprécier en pleine connaissance de cause la valeur de l’argument et nos raisons d’espérer.","Aimé, before retiring, made a point of telling me that Dreyfus was a thousand times guilty. “We will know everything, he told me, not this year, but next year: it was a very close gentleman in the general staff who told me. I asked him if we wouldn't decide to find out everything right away before the end of the year. He put down his cigarette,” continued Aimé, mimicking the scene and shaking his head and index finger as his client had done, meaning: don’t be too demanding. ""Not this year, Aimé, he said to me, touching me on the shoulder, it's not possible. But at Easter, yes! And Aimé tapped me lightly on the shoulder, saying: ""You see, I'm showing you exactly how he did"", either that he was flattered by this familiarity of a great personage, or so that I could better appreciate fully aware of the value of the argument and our reasons for hope.","Aimé could not go away without telling me that Dreyfus was guilty a thousand times over. ""It will all come out,"" he assured me, ""not this year, but next. It was a gentleman who's very thick with the General Staff, told me. I asked him if they wouldn't decide to bring it all to light at once, before the year is out. He laid down his cigarette,"" Aimé went on, acting the scene for my benefit, and, shaking his head and his forefinger as his informant had done, as much as to say: ""We mustn't expect too much!""—""'Not this year, Aimé,' those were his very words, putting his hand on my shoulder, 'It isn't possible. But next Easter, yes!' "" And Aimé tapped me gently on my shoulder, saying, ""You see, I'm letting you have it exactly as he told me,"" whether because he was flattered at this act of familiarity by a distinguished person or so that I might better appreciate, with a full knowledge of the facts, the worth of the arguments and our grounds for hope.","Before he left the room, Aimé felt the need to inform me that there could be no doubt that Dreyfus was guilty, totally and utterly.84 ‘The whole truth, he said, will come out, not this year, but next. It was this gent that’s very in the know with the General Staff that told me.’ I asked him whether it would not be decided to divulge everything all at once, before the end of the year. ‘Look, he put down his cigarette,’ Aimé said, acting the scene for me, shaking his head and his forefinger at me, as the hotel-guest had done, meaning: Don’t be so demanding. ‘ “Not this year, Aimé,” he says, giving me a tap on the shoulder. “Out of the question. But just you wait and see what Easter brings!” ’ Aimé gave me a tap on the shoulder, then said, ‘There, that’s exactly what he did,’ either because he was flattered at having been treated so familiarly by a great man, or so that I could better appreciate the force of the argument and the validity of the reasons why we must live in hope."
"M. de Charlus célébrait la véritable noblesse d’esprit et de cœur de ces femmes, jouant ainsi sur le mot par une équivoque qui le trompait lui-même et où résidait le mensonge de cette conception bâtarde, de cet ambigu d’aristocratie, de générosité et d’art, mais aussi sa séduction, dangereuse pour des êtres comme ma grand’mère à qui le préjugé plus grossier mais plus innocent d’un noble qui ne regarde qu’aux quartiers et ne se soucie pas du reste eût semblé trop ridicule, mais qui était sans défense dès que quelque chose se présentait sous les dehors d’une supériorité spirituelle, au point qu’elle trouvait les princes enviables par-dessus tous les hommes parce qu’ils purent avoir un La Bruyère, un Fénelon comme précepteurs.","M. de Charlus celebrated the true nobility of mind and heart of these women, thus playing on the word by an equivocation which deceived him generosity and art, but also his seduction, dangerous for beings like my grandmother to whom the cruder but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who only looks at the quarters and does not care about the rest would have seemed too ridiculous, but who was defenseless as soon as something presented itself beneath the exterior of a spiritual superiority, to the point that she found princes enviable above all men because they could have a La Bruyère, a Fénelon like preceptors.","M. de Charlus praised the true 'nobility' of mind and heart which characterised these women, playing upon the word in a double sense by which he himself was taken in, and in which lay the falsehood of this bastard conception, of this medley of aristocracy, generosity and art, but also its seductiveness, dangerous to people like my grandmother, to whom the less refined but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who cared only about quarterings and took no thought for anything besides would have appeared too silly for words, whereas she was defenceless as soon as a thing presented itself under the externals of a mental superiority, so much so, indeed, that she regarded Princes as enviable above all other men because they were able to have a Labruyère, a Fénelon as their tutors.","In celebrating the true nobility of mind and heart of these women, M. de Charlus was playing on a double meaning of the word which deceived him, and in which there lay not only the falseness of such a misbegotten notion, this medley of aristocracy, magnanimity and art, but also its dangerous attractiveness for people such as my grandmother, in whose eyes the flagrant but harmless prejudice of the noble who attends to the number of quarterings in another man’s escutcheon, and for whom nothing else counts, would have seemed too ridiculous; but she was susceptible to something masquerading as a spiritual superiority, which was why she thought princes were the most blessed of men, in that they could have as their tutor a La Bruyère or a Fénelon.57"
"Parfois pourtant la pluie trop cinglante nous retenait, ma grand’mère et moi, le Casino étant fermé, dans des pièces presque complètement vides comme à fond de cale d’un bateau quand le vent souffle, et où chaque jour, comme au cours d’une traversée, une nouvelle personne d’entre celles près de qui nous avions passé trois mois sans les connaître, le premier président de Rennes, la bâtonnier de Caen, une dame américaine et ses filles, venaient à nous, entamaient la conversation, inventaient quelque manière de trouver les heures moins longues, révélaient un talent, nous enseignaient un jeu, nous invitaient à prendre le thé, ou à faire de la musique, à nous réunir à une certaine heure, à combiner ensemble de ces distractions qui possèdent le vrai secret de nous faire donner du plaisir, lequel est de n’y pas prétendre, mais seulement de nous aider à passer le temps de notre ennui, enfin nouaient avec nous sur la fin de notre séjour des amitiés que le lendemain leurs départs successifs venaient interrompre. Je fis même la connaissance du jeune homme riche, d’un de ses deux amis nobles et de l’actrice qui était revenue pour quelques jours ; mais la petite société ne se composait plus que de trois personnes, l’autre ami était rentré à Paris. Ils me demandèrent de venir dîner avec eux dans leur restaurant. Je crois qu’ils furent assez contents que je n’acceptasse pas. Mais ils avaient fait l’invitation le plus aimablement possible, et bien qu’elle vînt en réalité du jeune homme riche, puisque les autres personnes n’étaient que ses hôtes, comme l’ami qui l’accompagnait, le marquis Maurice de Vaudémont, était de très grande maison, instinctivement l’actrice, en me demandant si je ne voudrais pas venir, me dit pour me flatter :","Sometimes, however, the excessively biting rain kept us, my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely empty, like in the bottom of the hold of a boat when the wind blows, and where every day, like during a crossing, a new person among those near whom we had spent three months without knowing them, the first president of Rennes, the president of Caen, an American lady and her daughters, came to us, started the conversation, invented some way of finding the shorter hours, revealed a talent, taught us a game, invited us to have tea, or to play music, to meet at a certain hour, to combine together those distractions which possess the true secret of making us give pleasure, which is not to claim it, but only to help us pass the time of our boredom, finally tied with us at the end of our stay friendships that the next day their successive departures came interrupt. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his two noble friends, and of the actress who had returned for a few days; but the little company no longer consisted of more than three people, the other friend had returned to Paris. They asked me to come and dine with them in their restaurant. I think they were quite happy that I didn't accept. But they had extended the invitation as kindly as possible, and although it actually came from the rich young man, since the other people were only his guests, like the friend who accompanied him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaudémont , was from a very big house, instinctively the actress, asking me if I wouldn't like to come, said to flatter me:","Sometimes, however, the driving rain kept my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely deserted, as in the lowest hold of a ship when a storm is raging; and there, day by day, as in the course of a sea–voyage, a new person from among those in whose company we had spent three months without getting to know them, the chief magistrate from Caen, the leader of the Cherbourg bar, an American lady and her daughters, came up to us, started conversation, discovered some way of making the time pass less slowly, revealed some social accomplishment, taught us a new game, invited us to drink tea or to listen to music, to meet them at a certain hour, to plan together some of those diversions which contain the true secret of pleasure–giving, which is to aim not at giving pleasure but simply at helping us to pass the time of our boredom, in a word, formed with us, at the end of our stay at Balbec, ties of friendship which, in a day or two, their successive departures from the place would sever. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his pair of aristocratic friends and of the actress, who had reappeared for a few days; but their little society was composed now of three persons only, the other friend having returned to Paris. They asked me to come out to dinner with them at their restaurant. I think, they were just as well pleased that I did not accept. But they had given the invitation in the most friendly way imaginable, and albeit it came actually from the rich young man, since the others were only his guests, as the friend who was staying with him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaudémont, came of a very good family indeed, instinctively the actress, in asking me whether I would not come, said, to flatter my vanity: ""","At times, however, the rain was too heavy and my grandmother and I had to stay indoors; the Casino having closed, we spent our days in sitting-rooms which were almost completely deserted, like a ship’s passengers keeping below decks out of the wind, where every day, as happens on a voyage, one or other of the people among whom we had spent three months without having made their acquaintance, the First President from Rennes,120 the bâtonnier from Caen, an American lady with her daughters, came to sit with us, struck up conversation, devised a way of making the hours seem less slow to pass, revealed a talent, taught us a game, invited us to tea, to make music with them, to foregather at a particular time of day, to collaborate with them in one of these diversions that have the happy knack of affording us true enjoyment, which consists not in being striven after, but in merely helping us to while away our boredom, and formed friendships with us right at the end of our stay which would be broken off the very next day by their successive departures. I even came to know the very wealthy young man, one of his two aristocratic friends and the actress (who had come back down to spend a few days in Balbec); but their little closed group now contained only the three of them, as their other friend had returned to Paris. They asked me to go and have dinner with them at their special restaurant. I think they were quite relieved that I declined the invitation. Still, it had been issued in the nicest possible manner: though the inviter was really the wealthy young man, the other two being just his guests, when the actress asked me whether I would go with them, she automatically phrased it so as to flatter me: ‘Maurice would love you to come’ –"
"Donc nous partirions simplement de Paris par ce train de une heure vingt-deux que je m’étais plu trop longtemps à chercher dans l’indicateur des chemins de fer, où il me donnait chaque fois l’émotion, presque la bienheureuse illusion du départ, pour ne pas me figurer que je le connaissais. Comme la détermination dans notre imagination des traits d’un bonheur tient plutôt à l’identité des désirs qu’il nous inspire qu’à la précision des renseignements que nous avons sur lui, je croyais connaître celui-là dans ses détails, et je ne doutais pas que j’éprouverais dans le wagon un plaisir spécial quand la journée commencerait à fraîchir, que je contemplerais tel effet à l’approche d’une certaine station ; si bien que ce train, réveillant toujours en moi les images des mêmes villes que j’enveloppais dans la lumière de ces heures de l’après-midi qu’il traverse, me semblait différent de tous les autres trains ; et j’avais fini, comme on fait souvent pour un être qu’on n’a jamais vu mais dont on se plaît à s’imaginer qu’on a conquis l’amitié, par donner une physionomie particulière et immuable à ce voyageur artiste et blond qui m’aurait emmené sur sa route, et à qui j’aurais dit adieu au pied de la cathédrale de Saint-Lô, avant qu’il se fût éloigné vers le couchant.","So we would simply leave Paris by this one-twenty-two hour train that I had taken too long to look for in the railroad indicator, where it gave me each time the emotion, almost the happy illusion of leaving. , so as not to imagine that I knew him. As the determination in our imagination of the traits of a happiness depends more on the identity of the desires it inspires in us than on the precision of the information we have about it, I thought I knew that one in its details, and I I had no doubt that I would experience a special pleasure in the car when the day began to cool, that I would contemplate such an effect as I approached a certain station; so much so that this train, always awakening in me the images of the same towns that I enveloped in the light of those afternoon hours through which it passes, seemed to me different from all the other trains; and I had ended, as one often does for a being whom one has never seen but whose friendship one likes to imagine one has won, by giving a particular and immutable physiognomy to this artistic traveler and blond who would have taken me on his way, and to whom I would have said goodbye at the foot of the cathedral of Saint-Lô, before he had moved away towards the sunset.","And so we were simply to leave Paris by that one twenty–two train which I had too often beguiled myself by looking out in the railway timetable, where its itinerary never failed to give me the emotion, almost the illusion of starting by it, not to feel that I already knew it. As the delineation in our mind of the features of any form of happiness depends more on the nature of the longings that it inspires in us than on the accuracy of the information which we have about it, I felt that I knew this train in all its details, nor did I doubt that I should feel, sitting in one of its compartments, a special delight as the day began to cool, should be contemplating this or that view as the train approached one or another station; so much so that this train, which always brought to my mind's eye the images of the same towns, which I bathed in the sunlight of those post–meridian hours through which it sped, seemed to me to be different from every other train; and I had ended—as we are apt to do with a person whom we have never seen but of whom we like to believe that we have won his friendship—by giving a distinct and unalterable cast of countenance to the traveller, artistic, golden–haired, who would thus have taken me with him upon his journey, and to whom I should bid farewell beneath the Cathedral of Saint–Lo, before he hastened to overtake the setting sun.","So our departure from Paris was to be quite simple, by that 1.22 train on which, perusing the railway time-tables, drawing from it each time the excitement and almost the blissful illusion of setting off, I had doted so often that I fancied I had already taken it. As our imagination, in fixing the definitive features of a future happiness, is more influenced by the unchangingness of our desire for that fulfilment than by any accuracy in the information which we may have about it, I was sure I had a close acquaintance with this one; and I had no doubt I would feel a special pleasure in our compartment as the warmth of the day began to wane, that as we drew into this or that station I would recognize a particular feature; for this train, having always given me glimpses of the same towns, which I saw tinged by the light of the afternoon hours through which it runs, seemed different from all other trains; and, as we often do with somebody we have never seen but whose friendship we like to fancy we already enjoy , I had come to picture it as a fair artistic wayfarer, to whom I had even given a particular and constant expression, who let me accompany him on his journey and whom, having bade him farewell outside the cathedral of Saint-Lô, I would then watch as he disappeared towards the setting sun."
"Puisqu’il refusait toute explication, j’essayai de m’en donner une, et je n’arrivai qu’à hésiter entre plusieurs dont aucune ne pouvait être la bonne. Peut-être ne se rappelait-il pas ou peut-être c’était moi qui avais mal compris ce qu’il m’avait dit le matin… Plus probablement par orgueil ne voulait-il pas paraître avoir cherché à attirer des gens qu’il dédaignait, et préférait-il rejeter sur eux l’initiative de leur venue. Mais alors, s’il nous dédaignait, pourquoi avait-il tenu à ce que nous vinssions, ou plutôt à ce que ma grand’mère vînt, car de nous deux ce fut à elle seule qu’il adressa la parole pendant cette soirée et pas une seule fois à moi. Causant avec la plus grande animation avec elle ainsi qu’avec Mme de Villeparisis, caché en quelque sorte derrière elles, comme il eût été au fond d’une loge, il se contentait seulement, détournant par moments le regard investigateur de ses yeux pénétrants, de l’attacher sur ma figure, avec le même sérieux, le même air de préoccupation, que si elle eût été un manuscrit difficile à déchiffrer.","Since he refused any explanation, I tried to give myself one, and I only managed to hesitate between several, none of which could be the right one. Maybe he didn't remember or maybe it was me who had misunderstood what he had said to me in the morning… More probably out of pride he didn't want to appear to have sought to attract people than he disdained, and he preferred to throw back on them the initiative of their coming. But then, if he disdained us, why had he insisted on our coming, or rather on my grandmother coming, for it was to her alone that he spoke during that evening and not once to me. Talking with the greatest animation with her as well as with Mme. to attach it to my face, with the same seriousness, the same air of preoccupation, as if it had been a manuscript difficult to decipher.","Since he refused to give any explanation, I tried to provide one for myself, but succeeded only in hesitating between several, none of which could be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember, or perhaps it was I who had failed to understand what he had said to me that morning…. More probably, in his pride, he did not wish to appear to have sought to attract people whom he despised, and preferred to cast upon them the responsibility for their intrusion. But then, if he despised us, why had he been so anxious that we should come, or rather that my grandmother should come, for of the two of us it was to her alone that he spoke that evening, and never once to me. Talking with the utmost animation to her, as also to Mme. de Villeparisis, hiding, so to speak, behind them, as though he were seated at the back of a theatre–box, he contented himself, turning from them every now and then the exploring gaze of his penetrating eyes, with fastening it on my face, with the same gravity, the same air of preoccupation as if my face had been a manuscript difficult to decipher.","In the face of M. de Charlus’s refusal to explain himself, I was reduced to conjecture, though I knew that none of the possible explanations which came to mind might be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember; perhaps I had misheard what he had said that morning … It appeared more likely that it was his pride making him wish to avoid appearing to seek out people whom he despised, and that he therefore shrugged off on to them the idea that they should come to visit. But if he despised us, why had he wanted us to come, or rather, since he addressed not a syllable to me all evening and spoke only to my grandmother, why had he wanted her to come? Sitting almost behind her and Mme de Villeparisis, and all but hidden by them, as though in a theatre-box, he contented himself from time to time with glancing away from them and letting his penetrating eye rest on my face, which it investigated with an air of gravity and preoccupation, as though I was a manuscript full of indecipherable things."
"Disons pour finir qui était le marquis de Norpois. Il avait été ministre plénipotentiaire avant la guerre et ambassadeur au Seize Mai, et, malgré cela, au grand étonnement de beaucoup, chargé plusieurs fois, depuis, de représenter la France dans des missions extraordinaires – et même comme contrôleur de la Dette, en Égypte, où grâce à ses grandes capacités financières il avait rendu d’importants services – par des cabinets radicaux qu’un simple bourgeois réactionnaire se fût refusé à servir, et auxquels le passé de M. de Norpois, ses attaches, ses opinions eussent dû le rendre suspect. Mais ces ministres avancés semblaient se rendre compte qu’ils montraient par une telle désignation quelle largeur d’esprit était la leur dès qu’il s’agissait des intérêts supérieurs de la France, se mettaient hors de pair des hommes politiques en méritant que le Journal des Débats lui-même les qualifiât d’hommes d’État, et bénéficiaient enfin du prestige qui s’attache à un nom aristocratique et de l’intérêt qu’éveille comme un coup de théâtre un choix inattendu. Et ils savaient aussi que ces avantages ils pouvaient, en faisant appel à M. de Norpois, les recueillir sans avoir à craindre de celui-ci un manque de loyalisme politique contre lequel la naissance du marquis devait non pas les mettre en garde, mais les garantir. Et en cela le gouvernement de la République ne se trompait pas. C’est d’abord parce qu’une certaine aristocratie, élevée dès l’enfance à considérer son nom comme un avantage intérieur que rien ne peut lui enlever (et dont ses pairs, ou ceux qui sont de naissance plus haute encore, connaissent assez exactement la valeur), sait qu’elle peut s’éviter, car ils ne lui ajouteraient rien, les efforts que sans résultat ultérieur appréciable font tant de bourgeois pour ne professer que des opinions bien portées et ne fréquenter que des gens bien pensants. En revanche, soucieuse de se grandir aux yeux des familles princières ou ducales au-dessous desquelles elle est immédiatement située, cette aristocratie sait qu’elle ne le peut qu’en augmentant son nom de ce qu’il ne contenait pas, de ce qui fait qu’à nom égal, elle prévaudra : une influence politique, une réputation littéraire ou artistique, une grande fortune. Et les frais dont elle se dispense à l’égard de l’inutile hobereau recherché des bourgeois et de la stérile amitié duquel un prince ne lui saurait aucun gré, elle les prodiguera aux hommes politiques, fussent-ils francs-maçons, qui peuvent faire arriver dans les ambassades ou patronner dans les élections, aux artistes ou aux savants dont l’appui aide à « percer » dans la branche où ils priment, à tous ceux enfin qui sont en mesure de conférer une illustration nouvelle ou de faire réussir un riche mariage.","Finally, let's say who the Marquis de Norpois was. He had been minister plenipotentiary before the war and ambassador to the Sixteenth of May, and, despite this, to the great astonishment of many, responsible several times since to represent France in extraordinary missions - and even as controller of the Debt, in Egypt , where, thanks to his great financial capacities, he had rendered important services - through radical cabinets that a simple reactionary bourgeois would have refused to serve, and to which M. de Norpois' past, his ties, his opinions would have owed him make suspect. But these advanced ministers seemed to realize that they were showing by such an appointment what breadth of mind they had when it came to the higher interests of France, putting themselves above the peers of politicians by deserving that the Journal des Débats itself described them as statesmen, and finally benefited from the prestige which attaches to an aristocratic name and from the interest aroused like a coup de theater by an unexpected choice. And they also knew that these advantages they could, by appealing to M. de Norpois, reap them without having to fear from him a lack of political loyalty against which the birth of the Marquis was not to put them on their guard, but the to guarantee. And in this the government of the Republic was not mistaken. It is firstly because a certain aristocracy, brought up from childhood to consider his name as an inner advantage that nothing can take away from him (and of which his peers, or those of even higher birth, know enough exactly the value), knows that it can be avoided, because they would add nothing to it, the efforts that without appreciable ulterior result so many bourgeois make to profess only well-held opinions and to associate only with well-meaning people. On the other hand, anxious to grow in the eyes of the princely or ducal families below which it is immediately situated, this aristocracy knows that it can only do so by increasing its name with what it did not contain, with what fact that in equal name, it will prevail: political influence, literary or artistic reputation, great fortune. And the expenses she dispenses with with regard to the useless squire sought after by the bourgeois and whose sterile friendship a prince would not be grateful to her, she will lavish on politicians, even if they are Freemasons, who can do to arrive in embassies or patronize in elections, to artists or scholars whose support helps to ""break through"" in the branch where they take precedence, to all those finally who are in a position to confer a new illustration or to make a rich man succeed marriage.","But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions,—even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services—by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des Débats itself, the title of 'Statesmen,' and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves,—to profess only the 'right' opinions, to frequent only the 'sound' people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter–skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it , a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free–masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or 'back' him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to 'arrive' in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to 'bring off' a rich marriage.","Of the Marquis de Norpois it can be said that, having been a plenipotentiary of Napoleon III before the Franco-Prussian War, he had been briefly elevated to an ambassadorship during the constitutional crisis of 16 May 1877. Despite this, and to the great astonishment of many, he had also been appointed several times since then as an extraordinary representative of France, accomplishing special missions and even acting as Comptroller of Public Monies in Egypt, where his great financial ability enabled him to render important services, at the behest of Radical cabinets, on whose behalf a mere middle-class reactionary would have declined to act, and to which M. de Norpois’s past, connections and opinions should have made him suspect. But these progressive ministers seemed to realize that, in making such an appointment, they were demonstrating the breadth of vision of which they were capable when the higher interests of France required it – so outclassing the average politician that they might expect to be called ‘statesmen’ by the Journal des débats itself! – while basking in the prestige afforded by the man’s noble name and title, and in the interest created by a dramatically unforeseeable choice. They knew too that, in having recourse to M. de Norpois, they could enjoy these advantages without fear of political disloyalty on his part, as the Marquis’s breeding, rather than giving them grounds to suspect him of any such thing, ensured against it. In this, the government of the Republic was not mistaken, for the good reason that a certain aristocracy, bred from childhood to see their name as an intrinsic benefit which nothing can take away (and the value of which is fairly well gauged by their peers and by those of even higher birth), know they can spare themselves the efforts made by many a commoner to profess only opinions seen as sound, and to mix only with people seen as proper, as these efforts would be of no profit to them. However, wishing to magnify themselves in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which are their immediate superiors, these aristocrats also know that they can do this only if they enhance their name with something extraneous to it, something which, other names being equal, will make theirs prevail: a political influence, a literary or artistic reputation, a large fortune. So they lavish their attentions not on the futile squireen who is courted by the commoner, or on a fruitless friendship which will never impress a prince, but on the politicians who, though they may be freemasons, can get someone appointed to a plum job in an embassy or elected to a safe seat, on the artists or academics who can pull a string or two in the area which they dominate, on anyone who might be able to lend some distinction, or help in the making of a rich marriage."
"Ces jours où je devais sortir avec les Swann, je venais chez eux pour le déjeuner, que Mme Swann appelait le lunch ; comme on n’était invité que pour midi et demi et qu’à cette époque mes parents déjeunaient à onze heures un quart, c’est après qu’ils étaient sortis de table que je m’acheminais vers ce quartier luxueux, assez solitaire à toute heure, mais particulièrement à celle-là où tout le monde était rentré. Même l’hiver et par la gelée s’il faisait beau, tout en resserrant de temps à autre le nœud d’une magnifique cravate de chez Charvet et en regardant si mes bottines vernies ne se salissaient pas, je me promenais de long en large dans les avenues en attendant midi vingt-sept. J’apercevais de loin, dans le jardinet des Swann, le soleil qui faisait étinceler comme du givre les arbres dénudés. Il est vrai que ce jardinet n’en possédait que deux. L’heure indue faisait nouveau le spectacle. À ces plaisirs de nature (qu’avivait la suppression de l’habitude, et même la faim), la perspective émotionnante de déjeuner chez Mme Swann se mêlait, elle ne les diminuait pas, mais les dominant les asservissait, en faisait des accessoires mondains ; de sorte que si, à cette heure où d’ordinaire je ne les percevais pas, il me semblait découvrir le beau temps, le froid, la lumière hivernale, c’était comme une sorte de préface aux œufs à la crème, comme une patine, un rose et frais glacis ajoutés au revêtement de cette chapelle mystérieuse qu’était la demeure de Mme Swann et au cœur de laquelle il y avait au contraire tant de chaleur, de parfums et de fleurs.","On those days when I had to go out with the Swanns, I came to their house for breakfast, which Madame Swann called lunch; as we were only invited for half past twelve and at that time my parents had lunch at a quarter past eleven, it was after they had left the table that I headed for this luxurious neighborhood, quite lonely in any time, but especially at that time when everyone had returned. Even in winter and in frost if the weather was nice, while occasionally tightening the knot of a magnificent tie from Charvet and watching to see if my patent leather boots were getting dirty, I walked up and down in the avenues while waiting for twelve twenty-seven. I could see from afar, in the Swann garden, the sun which made the bare trees sparkle like frost. It is true that this garden had only two. The undue hour made the spectacle new. To these pleasures of nature (which were heightened by the suppression of habit, and even by hunger), the exciting prospect of lunching at Madame Swann's was mingled, it did not diminish them, but dominating them enslaved them, made them worldly accessories. ; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, it seemed to me to discover the good weather, the cold, the winter light, it was like a sort of preface to creamed eggs, like a patina , a pink and fresh glaze added to the coating of this mysterious chapel that was Madame Swann's home and at the heart of which there was, on the contrary, so much warmth, perfumes and flowers.","On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner, which Mme. Swann called 'le lunch'; as one was not expected before half–past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet's and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty–seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns' little garden–plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare–boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature (intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger) the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers.","On days when I was going out with the Swanns, I was also invited to what Mme Swann called ‘the lunch’. As the Swanns’ invitation was for half-past twelve and my parents lunched at a quarter-past eleven , it was after they had left the table that I would set off for the Swanns’ luxurious district, which was rather deserted at any hour of the day but especially so at this time when everybody else was indoors. Even on frosty days in winter, if it was fine, adjusting from time to time the knot in my magnificent tie from Charvet’s, and making sure the gloss on my patent-leather boots remained unsullied, I loitered about the broad avenues, in the hope that it would soon be twenty-seven minutes past twelve. From a distance, I could see the leafless trees in the Swanns’ little front garden, sparkling in the sunshine as though white with frost. There were only two of these trees; but the untoward hour made it a novel spectacle for me. Such pleasures from the natural world, sharpened for me by the departure from habit and even by hunger, were mixed with the overwhelming prospect of lunch at Mme Swann’s; this prospect, though it dominated those other pleasures, did not diminish them; it exploited them, turned them into fashionable accessories. So although that time of day, when I did not normally notice fine weather, cold air and winter light, gave me the feeling of having just discovered them, they also felt like a mere preface to the eggs Béchamel, a sort of patina, an icy pink glaze added to the outside of that mysterious sanctum, the house where Mme Swann lived, inside which all would be warmth, perfumes and flowers."
"Bientôt le séjour de Saint-Loup toucha à sa fin. Je n’avais pas revu ces jeunes filles sur la plage. Il restait trop peu de l’après-midi à Balbec pour pouvoir s’occuper d’elles et tâcher de faire, à mon intention, leur connaissance. Le soir il était plus libre et continuait à m’emmener souvent à Rivebelle. Il y a dans ces restaurants, comme dans les jardins publics et les trains, des gens enfermés dans une apparence ordinaire et dont le nom nous étonne, si l’ayant par hasard demandé, nous découvrons qu’ils sont non l’inoffensif premier venu que nous supposions, mais rien de moins que le ministre ou le duc dont nous avons si souvent entendu parler. Déjà deux ou trois fois dans le restaurant de Rivebelle, nous avions, Saint-Loup et moi, vu venir s’asseoir à une table, quand tout le monde commençait à partir, un homme de grande taille, très musclé, aux traits réguliers, à la barbe grisonnante, mais de qui le regard songeur restait fixé avec application dans le vide. Un soir que nous demandions au patron qui était ce dîneur obscur, isolé et retardataire : « Comment, vous ne connaissiez pas le célèbre peintre Elstir ? » nous dit-il. Swann avait une fois prononcé son nom devant moi, j’avais entièrement oublié à quel propos ; mais l’omission d’un souvenir, comme celui d’un membre de phrase dans une lecture, favorise parfois non l’incertitude, mais l’éclosion d’une certitude prématurée. « C’est un ami de Swann, et un artiste très connu, de grande valeur », dis-je à Saint-Loup. Aussitôt passa sur lui et sur moi, comme un frisson, la pensée qu’Elstir était un grand artiste, un homme célèbre, puis, que nous confondant avec les autres dîneurs, il ne se doutait pas de l’exaltation où nous jetait l’idée de son talent. Sans doute, qu’il ignorât notre admiration, et que nous connaissions Swann, ne nous eût pas été pénible si nous n’avions pas été aux bains de mer. Mais attardés à un âge où l’enthousiasme ne peut rester silencieux, et transportés dans une vie où l’incognito semble étouffant, nous écrivîmes une lettre signée de nos noms, où nous dévoilions à Elstir dans les deux dîneurs assis à quelques pas de lui deux amateurs passionnés de son talent, deux amis de son grand ami Swann, et où nous demandions à lui présenter nos hommages. Un garçon se chargea de porter cette missive à l’homme célèbre.","Soon Saint-Loup's stay came to an end. I had not seen those young girls again on the beach. There was too little of the afternoon left at Balbec to be able to attend to them and try to make their acquaintance for me. In the evening he was freer and continued to take me often to Rivebelle. There are in these restaurants, as in the public parks and the trains, people locked in an ordinary appearance and whose name surprises us, if having asked it by chance, we discover that they are not the inoffensive first comer we supposed, but no less than the minister or the duke of whom we have so often heard. Already two or three times in the Rivebelle restaurant, Saint-Loup and I had seen come and sit down at a table, when everyone was starting to leave, a tall man, very muscular, with regular features, with a graying beard, but whose pensive gaze remained fixed with application in the void. One evening when we were asking the boss who this obscure, isolated and latecomer diner was: ""What, you didn't know the famous painter Elstir?"" he tells us. Swann had once uttered his name in front of me, I had entirely forgotten to what effect; but the omission of a memory, like that of a phrase in a reading, sometimes favors not uncertainty, but the blossoming of a premature certainty. “He is a friend of Swann, and a very well-known and valuable artist,” I tell Saint-Loup. Immediately passed over him and over me, like a shiver, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a famous man, then, confusing us with the other diners, he had no idea of the exaltation into which the idea of his talent. Doubtless that he was unaware of our admiration, and that we knew Swann, would not have been painful to us if we had not been to the sea baths. in a life where incognito seems suffocating, we wrote a letter signed with our names, where we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated a few steps from him two passionate amateurs of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and where we asked to present our homage to him. A boy took it upon himself to deliver this missive to the famous man.","Presently Saint– Loup's visit drew to an end. I had not seen that party of girls again on the beach. He was too little at Balbec in the afternoons to have time to bother about them, or to attempt, in my interest, to make their acquaintance. In the evenings he was more free, and continued to take me constantly to Rivebelle. There are, in those restaurants, as there are in public gardens and railway trains, people embodied in a quite ordinary appearance, whose name astonishes us when, having happened to ask it, we discover that this is not the mere inoffensive stranger whom we supposed but nothing less than the Minister or Duke of whom we have so often heard. Two or three times already, in the Rivebelle restaurant, we had—Saint–Loup and I—seen come in and sit down at a table when everyone else was getting ready to go, a man of large stature, very muscular, with regular features and a grizzled beard, gazing, with concentrated attention, into the empty air. One evening, on our asking the landlord who was this obscure, solitary and belated diner, ""What!"" he exclaimed, ""do you mean to say you don't know the famous painter Elstir?"" Swann had once mentioned his name to me, I had entirely forgotten in what connexion; but the omission of a particular memory, like that of part of a sentence when we are reading, leads sometimes not to uncertainty but to a birth of certainty that is premature. "" He is a friend of Swann, a very well known artist, extremely good,"" I told Saint–Loup. Whereupon there passed over us both, like a wave of emotion, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a celebrated man, and that, confounding us with the rest of the diners, he had no suspicion of the ecstasy into which we were thrown by the idea of his talent. Doubtless, his unconsciousness of our admiration and of our acquaintance with Swann would not have troubled us had we not been at the seaside. But since we were still at an age when enthusiasm cannot keep silence, and had been transported into a life in which not to be known is unendurable, we wrote a letter, signed with both our names, in which we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated within a few feet of him two passionate admirers of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and asked to be allowed to pay our homage to him in person. A waiter undertook to convey this missive to the celebrity.","Saint-Loup’s stay at Balbec was soon to come to an end. I had not seen any of the girls on the beach again. He could spend too few afternoons at Balbec to be able to busy himself with getting to know them on my behalf. In the evenings, he had more time and often took me out to Rivebelle. In those sorts of restaurants, as in public parks and trains, one comes across people enclosed in an ordinary appearance, and whose name astonishes us if, having asked by chance what they are called, we discover them to be, not the nondescript nobody we had supposed, but none other than the minister or the duke whom we have so often heard of. In the Rivebelle restaurant, Saint-Loup and I had several times noticed a tall man, very well-built, with regular features and a beard turning grey, who, having arrived when most other diners were leaving, would sit at a table resolutely staring at nothing with pensive, unfocussed eyes. When we asked the owner one night who this unknown, solitary, belated diner was, he replied, ‘What? Don’t you know the famous painter Elstir?’ Swann had once spoken the name of Elstir in my presence, though I had completely forgotten in what connection; but the loss of a memory, like the omission of a phrase during reading, rather than making for uncertainty, can lead to a premature certainty. ‘ He’s a friend of Swann’s, a very well-known artist, among the best,’ I said to Saint-Loup. The immediate thought that thrilled through the mind of each of us was that Elstir was a great artist, a famous man; and the next was that he must look on us as he looked on the other diners, and be quite unaware of the excitement that filled us at the knowledge of his brilliance. Had we not been at the seaside, we would not have been irked to realize he knew nothing of our admiration for him or our acquaintance with Swann. But we were still at an age when enthusiasm cries out to be known of; and with a sudden conviction that our incognito was intolerable, we wrote a letter, which we both signed, telling Elstir that the two diners sitting not far away were ardent admirers of his ability and friends of his great friend Swann, and asking his permission to present our compliments. We got a waiter to take our message to the famous man."
"– Ils sont retrouvés, ou plutôt ils n’ont jamais été perdus, voici ce qui était arrivé, nous dit Mme de Villeparisis, qui, sans que nous sussions comment, avait l’air beaucoup plus renseigné que nous sur les détails du voyage. Je crois que votre père avancera son retour à la semaine prochaine car il renoncera probablement à aller à Algésiras. Mais il a envie de consacrer un jour de plus à Tolède car il est admirateur d’un élève de Titien dont je ne me rappelle pas le nom et qu’on ne voit bien que là.","“They are found, or rather they were never lost, here is what had happened,” said Madame de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed much more informed than us about the details of the trip. I believe your father will bring forward his return to next week because he will probably give up going to Algeciras. But he wants to devote one more day to Toledo because he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian whose name I don't remember and who you can only see clearly there.","""It has been found; as a matter of fact, it was never really lost, I can tell you what happened,"" explained Mme. de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed to be far better informed than ourselves of the course of my father's travels. ""I think your father is now planning to come home earlier, next week, in fact, as he will probably give up the idea of going to Algeçiras. But he is anxious to devote a day longer to Toledo; it seems, he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian,—I forget the name—whose work can only be seen properly there.""","‘It has turned up, or rather it was never lost in the first place. You’ll never guess what happened,’ Mme de Villeparisis said, seeming inexplicably better informed than either of us about the details of my father’s journey. ‘I think your father will return home early, next week, since he will probably decide not to go on to Algeciras. However, he does want to have one day longer in Toledo, being a great admirer of one of Titian’s students – the name escapes me, but if you want to see his best things, you’ve got to go there.’"
"– Non, non, dit Bergotte, sauf dans la scène où elle avoue sa passion à Œnone et où elle fait avec la main le mouvement d’Hégeso dans la stèle du Céramique, c’est un art bien plus ancien qu’elle ranime. Je parlais des Koraï de l’ancien Éréchthéion, et je reconnais qu’il n’y a peut-être rien qui soit aussi loin de l’art de Racine, mais il y a tant déjà de choses dans Phèdre… , une de plus… Oh ! et puis, si, elle est bien jolie la petite Phèdre du VIe siècle, la verticalité du bras, la boucle du cheveu qui « fait marbre », si, tout de même, c’est très fort d’avoir trouvé tout ça. Il y a là beaucoup plus d’antiquité que dans bien des livres qu’on appelle cette année « antiques ».","“No, no,” said Bergotte, “except in the scene where she confesses her passion to Œnone and where she makes the movement of Hégeso with her hand in the stele of Ceramics, it is a much older art that she revives. I was talking about the Koraï of the old Erechtheion, and I recognize that there is perhaps nothing that is so far from the art of Racine, but there are already so many things in Phèdre…, one more … Oh ! and then, yes, she is very pretty, the little Phaedra from the 6th century, the verticality of the arm, the curl of the hair which “makes marble”, if, all the same, it is very strong to have found all that. There is much more antiquity there than in many of the books that this year is called ""antique"".","""No, no,"" said Bergotte, ""except in the scene where she confesses her passion to Œnone, where she moves her hand exactly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramicus, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Phèdre,… that one more… Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little sixth century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair 'frozen into marble,' yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling 'antique' this year.""","– No, I don’t mean that, Bergotte replied. Or rather, yes, but only in the scene where she confesses her love to Oenone, gesturing with exactly the hand movement of Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramicus. No, usually she brings back to life a form of art that’s much more ancient. I was referring to the Korai from the old Erechtheum – and I fully accept that it’s a form of art which is the antithesis of Racine. But then, there are so many things in Phèdre that one extra … Even so, I must agree, that pretty little Phèdre straight out of the sixth century BC is very nice, the perpendicularity of the arm, the curl of hair looking like marble, there’s no doubt about it, it all adds up to a real brain-wave. There’s much more antiquity in it than in many of this year ’s books about so-called antiquity.’"
"– Nous abusons de vous, disait ma grand’mère.","“We abuse you,” said my grandmother.","""But you must be tired of us by now,"" protested my grandmother. ""Not at all!","‘We’re imposing on you, my grandmother said."
"Ses parents ne me firent pas seulement l’éloge des vertus de Gilberte – cette même Gilberte qui même avant que je l’eusse jamais vue m’apparaissait devant une église, dans un paysage de l’Île-de-France, et qui ensuite m’évoquant non plus mes rêves, mais mes souvenirs, était toujours devant la haie d’épines roses, dans le raidillon que je prenais pour aller du côté de Méséglise ; – comme j’avais demandé à Mme Swann, en m’efforçant de prendre le ton indifférent d’un ami de la famille, curieux des préférences d’une enfant, quels étaient parmi les camarades de Gilberte ceux qu’elle aimait le mieux, Mme Swann me répondit :","Her parents not only praised the virtues of Gilberte to me – this same Gilberte who even before I had ever seen her appeared to me in front of a church, in a landscape of the Ile-de-France, and who afterwards no longer evoking my dreams, but my memories, was still in front of the hedge of pink thorns, in the steep path that I took to go towards Méséglise; – as I had asked Madame Swann, forcing myself to adopt the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious about the preferences of a child, which among Gilberte's comrades she liked best, Madame Swann replied:","But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte—that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the Méséglise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann (and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child), which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: ""","Her parents did not sing the virtues only of Gilberte, the girl who in my imagination, long before I had even set eyes on her, used to appear standing in front of a church, in a landscape somewhere in the Île-de-France,43 until the day when my dreams were replaced by memories and I saw her always in front of a hedge of pink hawthorn, beside the steep little lane that led up to the Méséglise way. There came a day when I asked Mme Swann, taking great care to speak in the casual tone of a family friend asking about a child’s likes and dislikes, whether Gilberte had a particular favourite among her friends; to which her mother replied:"
– Vous ne nous ferez pas le plaisir de dîner avec nous ?,"""You won't do us the pleasure of dining with us?""","And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaudémont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: ""Won't you give us the pleasure of dining with us?""",‘So we’re not to have us the pleasure of your company at dinner?’
"Ce fut vers cette époque que Bloch bouleversa ma conception du monde, ouvrit pour moi des possibilités nouvelles de bonheur (qui devaient du reste se changer plus tard en possibilités de souffrances), en m’assurant que, contrairement à ce que je croyais au temps de mes promenades du côté de Méséglise, les femmes ne demandaient jamais mieux que de faire l’amour. Il compléta ce service en m’en rendant un second que je ne devais apprécier que beaucoup plus tard : ce fut lui qui me conduisit pour la première fois dans une maison de passe. Il m’avait bien dit qu’il y avait beaucoup de jolies femmes qu’on peut posséder. Mais je leur attribuais une figure vague, que les maisons de passe devaient me permettre de remplacer par des visages particuliers. De sorte que si j’avais à Bloch – pour sa « bonne nouvelle » que le bonheur, la possession de la beauté, ne sont pas choses inaccessibles et que nous avons fait œuvre utile en y renonçant à jamais – une obligation de même genre qu’à tel médecin ou tel philosophe optimiste qui nous fait espérer la longévité dans ce monde, et de ne pas être entièrement séparé de lui quand on aura passé dans un autre, les maisons de rendez-vous que je fréquentai quelques années plus tard – en me fournissant des échantillons du bonheur, en me permettant d’ajouter à la beauté des femmes cet élément que nous ne pouvons inventer, qui n’est pas que le résumé des beautés anciennes, le présent vraiment divin, le seul que nous ne puissions recevoir de nous-même, devant lequel expirent toutes les créations logiques de notre intelligence et que nous ne pouvons demander qu’à la réalité : un charme individuel – méritèrent d’être classées par moi à côté de ces autres bienfaiteurs d’origine plus récente mais d’utilité analogue (avant lesquels nous imaginions sans ardeur la séduction de Mantegna, de Wagner, de Sienne, d’après d’autres peintres, d’autres musiciens, d’autres villes) : les éditions d’histoire de la peinture illustrées, les concerts symphoniques et les études sur les « Villes d’art ». Mais la maison où Bloch me conduisit et où il n’allait plus d’ailleurs lui-même depuis longtemps était d’un rang trop inférieur, le personnel était trop médiocre et trop peu renouvelé pour que j’y puisse satisfaire d’anciennes curiosités ou en contracter de nouvelles. La patronne de cette maison ne connaissait aucune des femmes qu’on lui demandait et en proposait toujours dont on n’aurait pas voulu. Elle m’en vantait surtout une, une dont, avec un sourire plein de promesses (comme si ç’avait été une rareté et un régal), elle disait : « C’est une Juive ! Ça ne vous dit rien ? » (C’est sans doute à cause de cela qu’elle l’appelait Rachel.) Et avec une exaltation niaise et factice, qu’elle espérait être communicative et qui finissait sur un râle presque de jouissance : « Pensez donc, mon petit, une Juive, il me semble que ça doit être affolant ! Rah ! » Cette Rachel, que j’aperçus sans qu’elle me vît, était brune, pas jolie, mais avait l’air intelligent, et, non sans passer un bout de langue sur ses lèvres, souriait d’un air plein d’impertinence aux michés qu’on lui présentait et que j’entendais entamer la conversation avec elle. Son mince et étroit visage était entouré de cheveux noirs et frisés, irréguliers comme s’ils avaient été indiqués par des hachures dans un lavis à l’encre de Chine. Chaque fois je promettais à la patronne, qui me la proposait avec une insistance particulière en vantant sa grande intelligence et son instruction, que je ne manquerais pas un jour de venir tout exprès pour faire la connaissance de Rachel, surnommée par moi « Rachel quand du Seigneur ». Mais le premier soir j’avais entendu celle-ci, au moment où elle s’en allait, dire à la patronne :","It was around this time that Bloch turned my conception of the world upside down, opened up new possibilities of happiness for me (which, moreover, were later to change into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, contrary to what I believed at the time on my walks near Meseglise, the women never asked for better than to make love. He completed this service by rendering me a second one which I was not to appreciate until much later: it was he who led me for the first time to a brothel. He had told me that there were many pretty women one could possess. But I gave them a vague figure, which brothels had to allow me to replace with specific faces. So that if I had to Bloch - for his ""good news"" that happiness, the possession of beauty, are not inaccessible things and that we have done useful work by renouncing them forever - an obligation of the same kind as 'to such an optimistic doctor or philosopher who makes us hope for longevity in this world, and not to be entirely separated from him when we have passed into another, the meeting houses which I frequented a few years later - in providing me with samples of happiness, allowing me to add to the beauty of women this element that we cannot invent, which is not only the summary of ancient beauties, the truly divine present, the only one that we cannot receive of ourselves, before which expire all the logical creations of our intelligence and which we can only ask of reality: an individual charm - deserved to be classed by me alongside these other benefactors of more recent origin but of utility analogue (before which we imagined without ardor the seduction of Mantegna, Wagner, Siena, according to other painters, other musicians, other cities): the editions of illustrated history of painting, the concerts symphony and studies on the ""Cities of art"". But the house where Bloch took me and where he himself hadn't been going for a long time was of too low a rank, the staff was too mediocre and too little renewed for me to be able to satisfy old curiosities there. or contract new ones. The owner of this house did not know any of the women she was asked for and always offered some who we would not have wanted. She praised me above all for one, one of which, with a smile full of promise (as if it had been a rarity and a treat), she said: ""She's a Jewess!"" Does it ring a bell ? (It was no doubt because of this that she called him Rachel.) And with a silly and artificial exaltation, which she hoped to be communicative and which ended in a rattle almost of pleasure: ""Think about it, my little , a Jew, it seems to me that it must be maddening! Ah! This Rachel, whom I saw without her seeing me, was dark, not pretty, but seemed intelligent, and, not without passing a tip of her tongue over her lips, smiled with an air full of impertinence. to the loaves that were presented to her and that I heard starting the conversation with her. Her thin, narrow face was framed by black, curly hair, uneven as if it had been indicated by hatching in a India ink wash. Each time I promised the landlady, who offered her to me with particular insistence, boasting of her great intelligence and her education, that I would not fail one day to come expressly to meet Rachel, nicknamed by me ""Rachel when du Lord "". But the first evening I had heard this one, as she was leaving, say to the landlady:","It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness (which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the Méséglise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch—for his 'good tidings' that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time—a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later—by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm—deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities): namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to 'Mediaeval Towns.' But the house to which Bloch led me (and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit), was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise (as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat) she would whisper: ""She is a Jewess! Doesn't that make you want to?"" (That, by the way, was probably why the girl's name was Rachel.) And with a silly and affected excitement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: ""Think of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn't that be lovely? Rrrr!"" This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the 'boys' who were introduced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen–strokes upon a wash–drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed ""Rachel when from the Lord."" But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: ""That's settled then; I shall be free to–morrow, if you have anyone you won't forget to send for me.""","It was about this time that Bloch disturbed my conception of the world and opened before me new vistas of possible happiness (which were later to turn into possibilities of great unhappiness): contradicting what I had believed about women in the days when I used to go for walks along the Méséglise way, he assured me that they were always on the look-out for opportunities to make love. This good turn he complemented with another, which I did not fully appreciate till much later: he it was who took me for the first time to a brothel. He had of course told me there were many pretty women in the world to be slept with. But the faces I had imagined for them were devoid of detail; and these brothels were to enable me to see that each of them had an individual face. So it was that, on the one hand, because of Bloch’s ‘good news’ – that happiness and the possession of beauty are not unattainable, and that we are misguided if we despair of ever enjoying them – I was as indebted to him as one is to the optimistic doctor or philosopher who gives one grounds for expecting a long life in this world, or a continued contact with it even after we pass into another world; and on the other hand, the brothels I frequented some years later (by giving me samples of happiness, and enabling me to enhance the beauty of women with that element which we can never invent, which is not just an amalgam of types of beauty familiar to us, but the truly divine gift, the only one we cannot receive from ourselves, the one beside which all the logical figments of our mind fade away, and which can be acquired only from reality: the charm of the individual) deserve to stand beside those other benefactors, more recent in origin but equal in utility, thanks to whom we can now revel in the full glory of Mantegna, Wagner and Siena, without having to invent pale, imagined versions of them based on other painters, other composers and other towns: the publishers of illustrated volumes on the history of painting, producers of symphony concerts and the compilers of those series on ‘Cities of the Arts’. But the first hotel Bloch took me to, which he himself had not frequented for some time, was of a rather inferior sort; its women were too nondescript, and they were not renewed often enough, for me to gratify familiar urges or contract unfamiliar ones. The madam did not know any of the women one asked her for, and kept suggesting others that one had no desire for. There was one woman in particular whom she praised to the skies, saying with a suggestive smile, as though talking about a treat or a rarity, ‘She’s a Jewess! Eh? Couldn’t you fancy that?’ (That was presumably why she called the girl Rachel.) And she added, filling her voice with a vacuous, affected rapturousness, which she hoped would be infectious, and dropping it almost to a moan of sensuous delight, ‘Just think, dearie! A Jewess! I mean! That must be a bit of all right, wouldn’t you say? Eh? Yer!’ I was able to look at Rachel without her seeing me: she was dark, not pretty but with an intelligent look, and as she licked her lips with the tip of her tongue, she smiled pertly at the different customers who were being introduced to her, and whom I could hear striking up conversation with her. Her face was thin and narrow, framed by black curly hair, which looked so irregular as to have been cross-hatched in an Indian ink wash-drawing. At each visit I assured the madam, who kept urging me to have the girl, stressing her high intelligence and level of education, that I would be sure to come back one day for the express purpose of meeting Rachel, for whom my private nickname was ‘Rachel, when of the Lord’.58 But the fact was that on the very first evening, I had overheard the girl say to the madam as she was leaving:"
"– Et est-ce que la fille de Mme Swann était à ce dîner, demandai-je à M. de Norpois, profitant pour faire cette question d’un moment où, comme on passait au salon, je pouvais dissimuler plus facilement mon émotion que je n’aurais fait à table, immobile et en pleine lumière.","""And was Madame Swann's daughter at that dinner?"" I would not have done at the table, motionless and in full light.","""And was Mme. Swann's daughter at the dinner? "" I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing–room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight.","– And was Mme Swann’s daughter present at the dinner, sir?’ I asked, glad to be able to broach this matter as we went through to the drawing-room, and thus conceal my excitement more easily than I might have at the table, sitting up there in full view."
– Ah ! on dit lift. Et d’un ton sec et hautain :,– Ah! we say lift. And in a dry and haughty tone:,"""Oh, you say 'lift,' do you?"" And then, in a dry and lofty tone: ""Not that it is of the slightest importance.""","Bloch himself proved this some time later, when he overheard me speak of the ‘lift’ and interrupted me with, ‘I see – so it’s “lift”.’ To which, in a sharp and supercilious tone, he added, ‘Anyway – doesn’t matter.’"
"C’était surtout un homme qui au fond n’aimait vraiment que certaines images et (comme une miniature au fond d’un coffret) que les composer et les peindre sous les mots. Pour un rien qu’on lui avait envoyé, si ce rien lui était l’occasion d’en entrelacer quelques-unes, il se montrait prodigue dans l’expression de sa reconnaissance, alors qu’il n’en témoignait aucune pour un riche présent. Et s’il avait eu à se défendre devant un tribunal, malgré lui il aurait choisi ses paroles, non selon l’effet qu’elles pouvaient produire sur le juge, mais en vue d’images que le juge n’aurait certainement pas aperçues.","Above all, he was a man who really only liked certain images and (like a miniature at the bottom of a box) only composing them and painting them under the words. For a nothing that had been sent to him, if this nothing gave him the opportunity to intertwine some of them, he showed himself prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, whereas he showed none for a rich man. here. And if he had had to defend himself in court, in spite of himself he would have chosen his words, not according to the effect they could produce on the judge, but in view of images that the judge would certainly not have seen. .","Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and (like a miniature set in the floor of a casket) the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an expensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived.","Most importantly, Bergotte was a man who took his greatest pleasure in certain images, in composing and painting them in words, like a miniature in the bottom of a casket. In response to some trifling gift, if it afforded him the opportunity of devising some of these images, he would be lavish in expressing his appreciation, though he might well have nothing to say in return for an expensive present. If he had ever been on trial in a court of law, despite himself he would have chosen his words not for the effect they might have on the judge, but for the sake of imagery which the judge would not even have noticed."
Je n’osais lui répondre qu’on en aurait éprouvé bien plus à Combray si j’avais eu l’air de ne pas le croire.,I dared not answer him that we would have experienced much more at Combray if I had seemed not to believe him.,I dared not reply that it would have caused an even greater sensation in Combray society if people had thought that I did not believe it.,I did not dare reply that I would have created greater consternation in Combray if it was thought I did not believe it.
"Françoise, au retour, déclara que je m’étais « trouvé indisposé », que j’avais dû prendre un « chaud et froid », et le docteur, aussitôt appelé, déclara « préférer » la « sévérité », la « virulence » de la poussée fébrile qui accompagnait ma congestion pulmonaire et ne serait « qu’un feu de paille » à des formes plus « insidieuses » et « larvées ». Depuis longtemps déjà j’étais sujet à des étouffements et notre médecin, malgré la désapprobation de ma grand’mère, qui me voyait déjà mourant alcoolique, m’avait conseillé, outre la caféine qui m’était prescrite pour m’aider à respirer, de prendre de la bière, du champagne ou du cognac quand je sentais venir une crise. Celles-ci avorteraient, disait-il, dans l’« euphorie » causée par l’alcool. J’étais souvent obligé pour que ma grand’mère permît qu’on m’en donnât, de ne pas dissimuler, de faire presque montre de mon état de suffocation. D’ailleurs, dès que je le sentais s’approcher, toujours incertain des proportions qu’il prendrait, j’en étais inquiet à cause de la tristesse de ma grand’mère que je craignais beaucoup plus que ma souffrance. Mais en même temps mon corps, soit qu’il fût trop faible pour garder seul le secret de celle-ci, soit qu’il redoutât que dans l’ignorance du mal imminent on exigeât de moi quelque effort qui lui eût été impossible ou dangereux, me donnait le besoin d’avertir ma grand’mère de mes malaises avec une exactitude où je finissais par mettre une sorte de scrupule physiologique. Apercevais-je en moi un symptôme fâcheux que je n’avais pas encore discerné, mon corps était en détresse tant que je ne l’avais pas communiqué à ma grand’mère. Feignait-elle de n’y prêter aucune attention, il me demandait d’insister. Parfois j’allais trop loin ; et le visage aimé, qui n’était plus toujours aussi maître de ses émotions qu’autrefois, laissait paraître une expression de pitié, une contraction douloureuse. Alors mon cœur était torturé par la vue de la peine qu’elle avait ; comme si mes baisers eussent dû effacer cette peine, comme si ma tendresse eût pu donner à ma grand’mère autant de joie que mon bonheur, je me jetais dans ses bras. Et les scrupules étant d’autre part apaisés par la certitude qu’elle connaissait le malaise ressenti, mon corps ne faisait pas opposition à ce que je la rassurasse. Je protestais que ce malaise n’avait rien de pénible, que je n’étais nullement à plaindre, qu’elle pouvait être certaine que j’étais heureux ; mon corps avait voulu obtenir exactement ce qu’il méritait de pitié, et pourvu qu’on sût qu’il avait une douleur en son côté droit, il ne voyait pas d’inconvénient à ce que je déclarasse que cette douleur n’était pas un mal et n’était pas pour moi un obstacle au bonheur, mon corps ne se piquant pas de philosophie ; elle n’était pas de son ressort. J’eus presque chaque jour de ces crises d’étouffement pendant ma convalescence. Un soir que ma grand’mère m’avait laissé assez bien, elle rentra dans ma chambre très tard dans la soirée, et s’apercevant que la respiration me manquait : « Oh ! mon Dieu, comme tu souffres », s’écria-t-elle, les traits bouleversés. Elle me quitta aussitôt, j’entendis la porte cochère, et elle rentra un peu plus tard avec du cognac qu’elle était allée acheter parce qu’il n’y en avait pas à la maison. Bientôt je commençai à me sentir heureux. Ma grand’mère, un peu rouge, avait l’air gêné, et ses yeux une expression de lassitude et de découragement.","Françoise, on my return, declared that I had ""found myself indisposed"", that I had had to take a ""hot and cold"", and the doctor, immediately called, declared that he ""preferred"" the ""severity"", the ""virulence"" of the feverish surge that accompanied my pulmonary congestion and would be ""just a flash in the pan"" in more ""insidious"" and ""creepy"" forms. For a long time already I had been subject to suffocation and our doctor, in spite of the disapproval of my grandmother, who saw me already dying as an alcoholic, had advised me, in addition to the caffeine which was prescribed for me to help me breathe, to have beer, champagne or brandy when I felt a crisis coming. These would abort, he said, in the ""euphoria"" caused by alcohol. I was often obliged, in order for my grandmother to allow it to be given to me, not to conceal, to show almost my state of suffocation. Besides, as soon as I felt it approaching, still uncertain of the proportions it would take, I was worried because of my grandmother's sadness, which I feared much more than my suffering. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep the secret of it alone, or because it feared that, in ignorance of the impending evil, some effort would be demanded of me which would have been impossible or dangerous for it. , gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my illnesses with an accuracy in which I ended up showing a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself an unfortunate symptom that I had not yet discerned, my body was in distress as long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. If she pretended not to pay any attention to it, he asked me to insist. Sometimes I went too far; and the beloved face, which was no longer always so master of its emotions as before, showed an expression of pity, a painful contraction. Then my heart was tortured by the sight of the pain she had; as if my kisses should have erased this pain, as if my tenderness could have given my grandmother as much joy as my happiness, I threw myself into her arms. And the scruples being on the other hand appeased by the certainty that she knew the discomfort felt, my body did not object to my reassuring her. I protested that there was nothing painful about this discomfort, that I was in no way to be pitied, that she could be certain that I was happy; my body had wanted to get exactly what it deserved in terms of pity, and as long as it was known that he had pain in his right side, he didn't mind my saying that this pain was not an evil and was not for me an obstacle to happiness, my body not priding itself on philosophy; it was not his responsibility. I had these attacks of suffocation almost every day during my convalescence. One evening when my grandmother had left me quite well, she came back to my room very late in the evening, and realizing that my breath was failing me: “Oh! my God, how you suffer, ”she cried, her features upset. She left me immediately, I heard the porte-cochere, and she came back a little later with some brandy that she had gone to buy because there was none at home. Soon I began to feel happy. My grandmother, a little flushed, looked embarrassed, and her eyes an expression of weariness and discouragement.","Françoise, on our return, declared that I had been 'taken bad,' that I must have caught a 'hot and cold,' while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he 'preferred' the 'severity,' the 'virulence' of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than 'a fire of straw,' to other forms, more 'insidious' and 'septic.' For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard's death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the 'euphoria' brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother's anxiety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an expression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it 'had a pain' in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy ; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, "" Oh, my poor boy,"" she exclaimed, her face quivering with sympathy, ""you are in dreadful pain."" She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed 'put out' about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection.","When we got back home, Françoise announced that I had ‘had a turn’, that I must have caught ‘a touch of the chill’; and the doctor, who was immediately summoned, announced that he ‘preferred’ the ‘fierce onset’ and the ‘virulence’ of the attack of fever accompanying my congestion of the lungs, which he said would turn out to be nothing but a ‘flash in the pan’, to a more ‘insidious’ or ‘lurking’ form of it. For years I had suffered from attacks of shortness of breath; and our doctor, despite the disapproval of my grandmother, who was convinced I would go to an alcoholic’s early grave, had recommended that, in addition to the caffeine already prescribed as an aid to my breathing, I should have a drink of beer, champagne or brandy each time I felt an attack coming on. The ‘euphoria’ brought on by the alcohol would, he said, ‘nip it in the bud’. Rather than conceal the state of breathlessness I was in, I was often obliged almost to exaggerate it, before my grandmother would allow me to have such a drink. Also, as soon as I felt an attack coming on, my uncertainty about how serious it might or might not be became a more acute anxiety because of my grandmother’s sorrow, which always upset me more than the fit itself. However, my body, whether because it was too infirm to bear the stress of keeping this secret to itself, or because it feared that someone unaware of the imminence of the attack might require me to make an effort that would prove impossible or harmful to it, made me need to inform my grandmother of my discomfort with a degree of accuracy which I eventually came to invest with a sort of physiological realism. If I noticed within me a bothersome symptom which I had never before identified, my body remained distressed until I could let my grandmother know. If she pretended not to pay attention, my body required me to persevere. Sometimes I went too far; and wincing with pain, the loved face, which was not as skilled as it had once been at concealing its emotions, showed an expression of pity. The sight of her grief cut me to the quick, and I fell into her arms, as though my kisses might take the grief away, as though my love for her could cause her as much joy as my being well and happy. My anxiety being now lessened by the knowledge that she was aware of the discomfort I had been in, my body had no objection to my reassuring her. I told her there was nothing distressing in the discomfort, that she must not feel sorry for me, that she could be sure I was happy. My body had been trying to receive as much sympathy as it deserved; and as long as it was known that it had a pain in its right side, it did not mind if I stated that the pain was neither severe nor an impediment to my happiness. My body did not take itself for a philosopher; philosophy was not its province. During my convalescence, I had fits of breathlessness like this almost every day. On one occasion, when my grandmother had seen me quite well earlier in the evening, she came back into my room much later; and when she saw how short of breath I was, her face was stricken with grief and she moaned, ‘ Oh dear, oh dear! You’re so ill!’ She went straight out , I heard the porte cochère and she came back in a little while with a bottle of brandy which, as we had none in the house, she had gone out to buy. I soon started to feel better. My grandmother was rather flushed and looked embarrassed; and her eyes were full of an expression of weariness and discouragement."
"Et c’était comme on invite un engagé volontaire avec son colonel, c’était dans l’intérêt de ma carrière, et comme si les chefs-d’œuvre se faisaient par « relations », qu’elle me disait de ne pas manquer de venir le lendemain dîner chez elle avec Bergotte.","And it was like one invites a volunteer with his colonel, it was in the interest of my career, and as if the masterpieces were made by ""relationships"", that she told me not to miss to come the next day to dine at her house with Bergotte.","And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of ""getting to know"" people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day, to meet Bergotte.","It sounded as though she was inviting a private to meet his colonel: it was so as to further my career, as though knowing ‘the right people’ could help produce a masterpiece, that she urged me not to miss dinner with Bergotte at her house the following evening."
"Personnellement, je ne tenais pas beaucoup à ce que Bloch vînt à l’hôtel. Il était à Balbec, non pas seul, malheureusement, mais avec ses sœurs qui y avaient elles-mêmes beaucoup de parents et d’amis. Or cette colonie juive était plus pittoresque qu’agréable. Il en était de Balbec comme de certains pays, la Russie ou la Roumanie, où les cours de géographie nous enseignent que la population israélite n’y jouit point de la même faveur et n’y est pas parvenue au même degré d’assimilation qu’à Paris par exemple. Toujours ensemble, sans mélange d’aucun autre élément, quand les cousines et les oncles de Bloch, ou leurs coreligionnaires mâles ou femelles se rendaient au Casino, les unes pour le « bal », les autres bifurquant vers le baccarat, ils formaient un cortège homogène en soi et entièrement dissemblable des gens qui les regardaient passer et les retrouvaient là tous les ans sans jamais échanger un salut avec eux, que ce fût la société des Cambremer, le clan du premier président, ou des grands et petits bourgeois, ou même de simples grainetiers de Paris, dont les filles, belles, fières, moqueuses et françaises comme les statues de Reims, n’auraient pas voulu se mêler à cette horde de fillasses mal élevées, poussant le souci des modes de « bains de mer » jusqu’à toujours avoir l’air de revenir de pêcher la crevette ou d’être en train de danser le tango. Quant aux hommes, malgré l’éclat des smokings et des souliers vernis, l’exagération de leur type faisait penser à ces recherches dites « intelligentes » des peintres qui, ayant à illustrer les Évangiles ou les Mille et Une Nuits, pensent au pays où la scène se passe et donnent à saint Pierre ou à Ali-Baba précisément la figure qu’avait le plus gros « ponte » de Balbec. Bloch me présenta ses sœurs, auxquelles il fermait le bec avec la dernière brusquerie et qui riaient aux éclats des moindres boutades de leur frère, leur admiration et leur idole. De sorte qu’il est probable que ce milieu devait renfermer comme tout autre, peut-être plus que tout autre, beaucoup d’agréments, de qualités et de vertus. Mais pour les éprouver, il eût fallu y pénétrer. Or, il ne plaisait pas, il le sentait, il voyait là la preuve d’un antisémitisme contre lequel il faisait front en une phalange compacte et close où personne d’ailleurs ne songeait à se frayer un chemin.","Personally, I didn't really want Bloch to come to the hotel. He was at Balbec, not alone, unfortunately, but with his sisters who themselves had many relatives and friends there. But this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. It was with Balbec as with certain countries, Russia or Rumania, where geography lessons teach us that the Jewish population there does not enjoy the same favor and has not reached the same degree of assimilation there as in Paris for example. Always together, without mixing any other element, when Bloch's cousins and uncles, or their male or female co-religionists, went to the Casino, some for the ""ball"", the others branching off to baccarat, they formed a procession homogeneous in itself and entirely unlike the people who watched them go by and found them there every year without ever exchanging a greeting with them, whether it was the Cambremer society, the clan of the first president, or the great and petty bourgeois, or even simple seedsmen of Paris, whose daughters, beautiful, proud, mocking and French like the statues of Reims, would not have liked to mingle with this horde of ill-bred girls, pushing the concern for the fashions of ""sea bathing"" to the point of 'always seem to come back from shrimp fishing or dancing the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of the tuxedos and varnished shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of the so-called ""intelligent"" research of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Thousand and One Nights, think of the country where the scene takes place and gives Saint Peter or Ali-Baba precisely the face that the biggest ""laying"" of Balbec had. Bloch introduced me to his sisters, to whom he shut their mouths with the utmost abruptness and who laughed out loud at their brother's slightest quips, their admiration and their idol. So it is probable that this environment must have contained like any other, perhaps more than any other, many amenities, qualities and virtues. But to experience them, it would have been necessary to enter them. However, he did not like it, he felt it, he saw there the proof of an anti-Semitism against which he stood up in a compact and closed phalanx where no one else thought of making their way.","Personally, I was not particularly anxious that Bloch should come to the hotel. He was at Balbec not by himself, unfortunately, but with his sisters, and they in turn had innumerable relatives and friends staying there. Now this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec was in this respect like such countries as Russia or Rumania, where the geography books teach us that the Israelite population does not enjoy anything approaching the same esteem and has not reached the same stage of assimilation as, for instance, in Paris. Always together, with no blend of any other element, when the cousins and uncles of Bloch or their coreligionists male or female repaired to the Casino, the ladies to dance, the gentlemen branching off towards the baccarat–tables, they formed a solid troop, homogeneous within itself, and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past and found them there again every year without ever exchanging a word or a sign with them, whether these were on the Cambremers' list, or the presiding magistrate's little group, professional or 'business' people, or even simple corn–chandlers from Paris, whose daughters, handsome, proud, derisive and French as the statues at Rheims, would not care to mix with that horde of ill –bred tomboys, who carried their zeal for 'seaside fashions' so far as to be always apparently on their way home from shrimping or out to dance the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of their dinner–jackets and patent–leather shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of what people call the 'intelligent research' of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, consider the country in which the scenes are laid, and give to Saint Peter or to Ali–Baba the identical features of the heaviest 'punter' at the Balbec tables. Bloch introduced his sisters, who, though he silenced their chatter with the utmost rudeness, screamed with laughter at the mildest sallies of this brother, their blindly worshipped idol. So that it is probable that this set of people contained, like every other, perhaps more than any other, plenty of attractions, merits and virtues. But in order to experience these, one had first to penetrate its enclosure. Now it was not popular; it could feel this; it saw in its unpopularity the mark of an anti–semitism to which it presented a bold front in a compact and closed phalanx into which, as it happened, no one ever dreamed of trying to make his way.","I was none too pleased at the thought that Bloch might turn up at the hotel. The trouble was that he was not alone: he had come to Balbec with his sisters, who had many relatives and friends there. This Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec, in this respect, was rather like certain countries, Russia or Rumania, for example, where, as geography classes inform us, the Jewish population does not enjoy the same favour, and has not attained the same degree of assimilation, as in Paris, say. Eternally together, quite without admixture of any extraneous element, whenever Bloch’s uncles or female cousins, or any of their co-religionists of either sex, went to the Casino, some of them heading for the ‘ball’, others turning towards the baccarat rooms, they formed a homogeneous procession, quite distinct from the people who watched them pass and who recognized them from previous years without ever exchanging a greeting with them, whether it was the Cambremers’ set, the little clan of the First President from Caen, people of exalted social position or of the mere middle classes, even simple corn chandlers down from Paris, none of whose daughters, beautiful, proud and scornful, as French as the statues of Rheims cathedral, would have dreamed of mixing with a rabble of ill-bred hussies who thought ‘seaside’ modishness so important that they always looked as though they had just been shrimping or were dancing the tango. As for the men, despite their glossy dinner-jackets and patent-leather shoes, they were so unmistakable in their physical characteristics that they brought to mind those allegedly ‘clever’ likenesses contrived by painters who, in illustrating the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, remember the country where the story unfolds and give to St Peter or Ali Baba the features of the most self-important ‘punter’ in Balbec. Bloch introduced his sisters to me, girls at whom he would suddenly snap to make them shut up, but who hailed with gales of mirth the slightest joke of this brother of theirs, their admiration and their idol. It is quite likely that this Jewish community, like any other, perhaps more than any other, could boast of many charms, qualities and virtues. The enjoyment of these, however, was restricted to its members. The fact was they were disliked; and this, once they became aware of it, became a proof in their eyes of anti-Semitism, against which they ranged themselves in a dense phalanx, closing ranks in the face of a world which was, in any case, in no mind to join their group."
"« Hé bien ! je ne l’aurais pas cru, le père Norpois n’est pas du tout opposé à l’idée que tu fasses de la littérature », m’avait dit mon père. Et comme, assez influent lui-même, il croyait qu’il n’y avait rien qui ne s’arrangeât, ne trouvât sa solution favorable dans la conversation des gens importants : « Je le ramènerai dîner un de ces soirs en sortant de la Commission. Tu causeras un peu avec lui pour qu’il puisse t’apprécier. Écris quelque chose de bien que tu puisses lui montrer ; il est très lié avec le directeur de la Revue des Deux-Mondes, il t’y fera entrer, il réglera cela, c’est un vieux malin ; et, ma foi, il a l’air de trouver que la diplomatie, aujourd’hui !… »",""" Well ! I would not have believed it, Father Norpois is not at all opposed to the idea of you doing literature,” my father had told me. And since, quite influential himself, he believed that nothing was going to get better, he didn't find a favorable solution in the conversation of important people: ""I'll bring him back to dinner one of these evenings when I leave the Commission. You will talk a little with him so that he can appreciate you. Write something good that you can show her; he's very close to the director of the Revue des Deux-Mondes, he'll get you in, he'll sort it out, he's a clever old man; and, my faith, he seems to find that diplomacy today!…”","""Well, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn't at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,"" my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be 'arranged,' no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who 'counted.' ""I shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux–Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays——!""","‘Well, who’d have believed it!’ my father said. ‘Old Norpois’s got nothing against the idea that you might make a career in literature.’ Being himself quite influential, he believed there was nothing which could not be sorted out and favourably resolved by a chat between important men. ‘I’ll bring him home to dinner one of these nights after a session at the Select Committee. You can have a chat with him and he’ll be able to form some opinion of you. So just write something nice that you can show him. He’s a great friend of the editor of the Revue des Deux Mondes, you know. He could get you in there, he could look after it for you, he’s a pretty sharp old chap. I must say, he doesn’t sound greatly enamoured of the diplomatic career nowadays.’"
"Il y avait donc, enclavé en mon camarade Bloch, un père Bloch, qui retardait de quarante ans sur son fils, débitait des anecdotes saugrenues, et en riait autant au fond de mon ami que ne faisait le père Bloch extérieur et véritable, puisque au rire que ce dernier lâchait non sans répéter deux ou trois fois le dernier mot, pour que son public goûtât bien l’histoire, s’ajoutait le rire bruyant par lequel le fils ne manquait pas à table de saluer les histoires de son père. C’est ainsi qu’après avoir dit les choses les plus intelligentes, Bloch jeune, manifestant l’apport qu’il avait reçu de sa famille, nous racontait pour la trentième fois quelques-uns des mots que le père Bloch sortait seulement (en même temps que sa redingote) les jours solennels où Bloch jeune amenait quelqu’un qu’il valait la peine d’éblouir : un de ses professeurs, un « copain » qui avait tous les prix, ou, ce soir-là, Saint-Loup et moi. Par exemple : « Un critique militaire très fort, qui avait savamment déduit avec preuves à l’appui pour quelles raisons infaillibles dans la guerre russo-japonaise, les Japonais seraient battus et les Russes vainqueurs », ou bien : « C’est un homme éminent qui passe pour un grand financier dans les milieux politiques et pour un grand politique dans les milieux financiers. » Ces histoires étaient interchangeables avec une du baron de Rothschild et une de sir Rufus Israël, personnages mis en scène d’une manière équivoque qui pouvait donner à entendre que M. Bloch les avait personnellement connus.","So there was, enclosed in my comrade Bloch, a father Bloch, who was behind his son by forty years, spouted out absurd anecdotes, and laughed at them as much in the depths of my friend as did the exterior and genuine father Bloch, since at the laughter that the latter let loose, not without repeating the last word two or three times, so that his audience would get a good taste of the story, was added the noisy laughter with which the son did not fail at the table to salute his father's stories. Thus, after having said the most intelligent things, young Bloch, showing the contribution he had received from his family, told us for the thirtieth time some of the words that Father Bloch only used (in same time as his frock coat) the solemn days when young Bloch brought along someone worth dazzling: one of his teachers, a ""buddy"" who had all the prizes, or, that evening, Saint- Wolf and me. For example: ""A very strong military critic, who had learnedly deduced with supporting evidence for what infallible reasons in the Russo-Japanese war the Japanese would be beaten and the Russians victorious"", or else: ""He is a man eminent who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician in financial circles. These stories were interchangeable with one of Baron de Rothschild and one of Sir Rufus Israel, characters staged in an equivocal manner which might suggest that Mr. Bloch knew them personally.","There was, then, embedded in my friend Bloch a father Bloch who lagged forty years behind his son, told impossible stories and laughed as loudly at them from the heart of my friend as did' the separate, visible and authentic father Bloch, since to the laugh which the latter emitted, not without several times repeating the last word so that his public might taste the full flavour of the story, was added the braying laugh with which the son never failed, at table, to greet his father's anecdotes. Thus it came about that after saying the most intelligent things young Bloch, to indicate the portion that he had inherited from his family, would tell us for the thirtieth time some of the gems which father Bloch brought out only (with his swallow–tail coat) on the solemn occasions on which young Bloch brought someone to the house on whom it was worth while making an impression; one of his masters, a 'chum' who had taken all the prizes, or, this evening, Saint–Loup and myself. For instance: ""A military critic of great insight, who had brilliantly worked out, supporting them with proofs, the reasons for which, in the Russo–Japanese war, the Japanese must inevitably be beaten and the Russians victorious,"" or else: ""He is an eminent gentleman who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician among financiers. "" These stories were interchangeable with one about Baron de Rothschild and one about Sir Rufus Israels, who were brought into the conversation in an equivocal manner which might let it be supposed that M. Bloch knew them personally.","So, set within my old school-friend Bloch was Bloch senior, forty years behind the times of his son, who recounted stupid stories and laughed at them in the son’s voice, as much as the real Bloch senior laughed at them in his own voice, since whenever he bayed with laughter and repeated the funny part several times so that his audience would properly savour the point of each anecdote, the gales of the son’s faithful guffaws would never fail to celebrate in unison with the father the latter’s table-talk. The younger Bloch was capable of saying things that were strikingly clever, which he would follow immediately by showing what he owed to his family, telling for the thirtieth time some jokes of his father’s which the latter trotted out, along with his frock-coat, only on those ceremonial occasions when Bloch the younger brought home somebody whom it was worth going to some trouble to impress: one of his former teachers, a ‘chum’ who was a great prize-winner or, as on this occasion, Saint-Loup and myself. So we were treated to this: ‘A military commentator of genius, who had proved without the shadow of a doubt why, in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese would be beaten and the Russians could not fail to win …’; and then to this: ‘He’s an eminent man who’s seen as a great financier in political circles and a great politician in financial circles.’ These statements were interchangeable with others concerning the Baron de Rothschild and Sir Rufus Israel, two characters who were introduced ambiguously, in a way which could make a listener infer that M. Bloch senior had known them personally."
"– Oh ! c’est une femme bien simple, elle est charmante, on ne fait pas moins de façons. Je pensais que vous alliez venir, je vous faisais des signes… je vous aurais présenté ! dit-il en corrigeant par une légère ironie l’énormité de cette proposition comme Assuérus quand il dit à Esther : « Faut-il de mes États vous donner la moitié ! »","- Oh ! She's a very simple woman, she's charming, we don't do less manners. I thought you were coming, I was waving to you… I would have introduced you! he said, correcting with a slight irony the enormity of this proposition like Ahasuerus when he said to Esther: “Must I give you half of my estates! »","Not through the females."" ""Oh, she's a very simple soul, she is charming, no stand–offishness about her. I thought you were coming to join us. I was making signals to you…I would have introduced you!"" he asserted, tempering with a hint of irony the vast generosity of the offer, like Ahasuerus when he says to Esther: Of all my Kingdom must I give you half!","Not from the distaff side. – She’s a very unspoiled lady, you know, quite charming. A less stuck-up person would be hard to find. I thought you might come over. I tried to tip you the wink. I could have introduced you!’ said the bâtonnier, moderating with a slight irony the enormity of the suggestion, like Asahuerus saying to Esther, ‘So now must I give you the half of my Estate?’18"
"Mais la parfaite indépendance des muscles du visage à laquelle M. de Norpois était arrivé lui permettait d’écouter sans avoir l’air d’entendre. Mon père finissait par se troubler : « J’avais pensé à demander l’avis de la Commission… » disait-il à M. de Norpois après de longs préambules. Alors du visage de l’aristocratique virtuose qui avait gardé l’inertie d’un instrumentiste dont le moment n’est pas venu d’exécuter sa partie sortait avec un débit égal, sur un ton aigu et comme ne faisant que finir, mais confiée cette fois à un autre timbre, la phrase commencée : « Que, bien entendu, vous n’hésiterez pas à réunir, d’autant plus que les membres vous sont individuellement connus et peuvent facilement se déplacer. » Ce n’était pas évidemment en elle-même une terminaison bien extraordinaire. Mais l’immobilité qui l’avait précédée la faisait se détacher avec la netteté cristalline, l’imprévu quasi malicieux de ces phrases par lesquelles le piano, silencieux jusque-là, réplique, au moment voulu, au violoncelle qu’on vient d’entendre, dans un concerto de Mozart.","But the perfect independence of the facial muscles at which M. de Norpois had arrived enabled him to listen without seeming to hear. My father ended up getting confused: ""I had thought of asking the Commission's opinion..."" he said to M. de Norpois after a long preamble. Then from the face of the aristocratic virtuoso who had retained the inertia of an instrumentalist whose time has not come to perform his part came out with an even flow, in a shrill tone and as if only finishing, but entrusted this time in another timbre, the sentence begun: ""Which, of course, you will not hesitate to bring together, especially since the members are known to you individually and can easily move around."" This was obviously not in itself a very extraordinary ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it stand out with the crystalline clarity, the almost mischievous unforeseenness of those phrases by which the piano, silent until then, replies, at the desired moment, to the cello that has just been played. hear, in a Mozart concerto.","But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. ""I had thought,"" he ventured, after an endless preamble, ""of asking the advice of the Commission…"" Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion (but scored for a different voice) of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: ""of which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day. "" This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then, ""takes up"", at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto.","The state of total independence from his facial muscles in which M. de Norpois lived enabled him to listen while not seeming to hear. My father, having stumbled through a longish preamble, eventually had to grope for a word: ‘So I had been thinking I might just ask for, you know, the views of the Select Committee …’ Whereupon, from the countenance of the aristocratic virtuoso, who had been sitting as still as an instrumentalist awaiting his turn to play, there came, with perfect attack and a smooth delivery, in a sharpened pitch and sounding as though finishing a phrase just begun, but in a different tone-colouring, the words, ‘ … of which, of course, you will not hesitate to convene a meeting, given that each and every one of its members is personally known to you and can come in at any moment.’ In itself, this completion was hardly remarkable. But the unmoving posture which had preceded it gave it the sudden crystal clarity, the almost mischievous surprise of the phrases by which the piano, after its silent rests, makes its punctual little replies to the cello, in a concerto by Mozart."

"– Vous me faites penser, car c’était tout à fait le même, à un fauteuil que j’ai eu longtemps, mais que j’ai fini par ne pas pouvoir garder parce qu’il avait été donné à ma mère par la malheureuse duchesse de Praslin. Ma mère qui était pourtant la personne la plus simple du monde, mais qui avait encore des idées qui viennent d’un autre temps et que déjà je ne comprenais pas très bien, n’avait pas voulu d’abord se laisser présenter à Mme de Praslin qui n’était que Mlle Sebastiani, tandis que celle-ci, parce qu’elle était duchesse, trouvait que ce n’était pas à elle à se faire présenter. Et par le fait, ajoutait Mme de Villeparisis oubliant qu’elle ne comprenait pas ce genre de nuances, n’eût-elle été que Mme de Choiseul que sa prétention aurait pu se soutenir. Les Choiseul sont tout ce qu’il y a de plus grand, ils sortent d’une sœur du roi Louis-le-Gros, ils étaient de vrais souverains en Bassigny. J’admets que nous l’emportons par les alliances et l’illustration, mais l’ancienneté est presque la même. Il était résulté de cette question de préséance des incidents comiques, comme un déjeuner qui fut servi en retard de plus d’une grande heure que mit l’une de ces dames à accepter de se laisser présenter. Elles étaient malgré cela devenues de grandes amies et elle avait donné à ma mère un fauteuil du genre de celui-ci et où, comme vous venez de faire, chacun refusait de s’asseoir. Un jour ma mère entend une voiture dans la cour de son hôtel. Elle demande à un petit domestique qui c’est. « C’est Madame la duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, madame la comtesse. – Ah ! bien, je la recevrai. » Au bout d’un quart d’heure, personne. « Hé bien, Madame la duchesse de La Rochefoucauld ? où est-elle donc ? – Elle est dans l’escalier, a souffle, madame la comtesse », répond le petit domestique qui arrivait depuis peu de la campagne où ma mère avait la bonne habitude de les prendre. Elle les avait souvent vu naître. C’est comme cela qu’on a chez soi de braves gens. Et c’est le premier des luxes. En effet, la duchesse de La Rochefoucauld montait difficilement, étant énorme, si énorme, que quand elle entra ma mère eut un instant d’inquiétude en se demandant où elle pourrait la placer. À ce moment le meuble donné par Mme de Praslin frappa ses yeux : « Prenez donc la peine de vous asseoir », dit ma mère en le lui avançant. Et la duchesse le remplit jusqu’aux bords. Elle était, malgré cette importance, restée assez agréable. « Elle fait encore un certain effet quand elle entre », disait un de nos amis. « Elle en fait surtout quand elle sort », répondit ma mère qui avait le mot plus leste qu’il ne serait de mise aujourd’hui. Chez Mme de La Rochefoucauld même, on ne se gênait pas pour plaisanter devant elle, qui en riait la première, ses amples proportions. « Mais est-ce que vous êtes seul ? » demanda un jour à M. de La Rochefoucauld ma mère qui venait faire visite à la duchesse et qui, reçue à l’entrée par le mari, n’avait pas aperçu sa femme qui était dans une baie du fond. « Est-ce que Madame de La Rochefoucauld n’est pas là ? je ne la vois pas. – Comme vous êtes aimable ! » répondit le duc qui avait un des jugements les plus faux que j’aie jamais connus, mais ne manquait pas d’un certain esprit.","– You remind me, because it was exactly the same, of an armchair that I had for a long time, but which I ended up not being able to keep because it had been given to my mother by the unfortunate Duchess of Praslin. My mother, who was nevertheless the simplest person in the world, but who still had ideas which come from another time and which I already did not understand very well, had not wanted at first to allow herself to be introduced to Madame de Praslin who was only Mademoiselle Sebastiani, while the latter, because she was a duchess, found that it was not for her to be introduced. And in fact, added Madame de Villeparisis, forgetting that she did not understand this kind of nuance, had she only been Madame de Choiseul, her claim could have been supported. The Choiseuls are all the greatest, they come from a sister of King Louis-le-Gros, they were true sovereigns in Bassigny. I admit we win by alliances and illustration, but the seniority is almost the same. This question of precedence had resulted in comic incidents, such as a luncheon which was served more than an hour late, which took one of the ladies to agree to be introduced. Despite this, they had become great friends and she had given my mother an armchair like this one in which, as you have just done, everyone refused to sit down. One day my mother hears a car in the courtyard of her hotel. She asks a little servant who it is. ""It's Madame la Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, Madame la Comtesse. – Ah! well, I will receive it. After a quarter of an hour, no one. ""Well, Madame la Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?"" where is she? ""She's on the stairs, a breath, Madame la Comtesse,"" replied the little servant, who had recently arrived from the country where my mother had the good habit of taking them. She had often seen them born. That's how you have good people at home. And this is the first of the luxuries. In fact, the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld ascended with difficulty, being enormous, so enormous, that when she entered my mother was for a moment uneasy, wondering where she could place her. At that moment the piece of furniture given by Madame de Praslin struck her eyes: ""Take the trouble to sit down,"" said my mother, offering it to her. And the Duchess fills it to the brim. She had, despite this importance, remained pleasant enough. “She still has a certain effect when she comes in,” said one of our friends. “She does it especially when she goes out,” replied my mother, who had the more nimble word than it would be appropriate today. Even at Madame de La Rochefoucauld's, they weren't shy about joking in front of her, who was the first to laugh at her ample proportions. “But are you alone? asked M. de La Rochefoucauld one day, my mother, who had come to pay a visit to the Duchess and who, received at the entrance by the husband, had not seen his wife, who was in a bay at the back. “Is Madame de La Rochefoucauld not there? I do not see her. - How kind you are! replied the duke, who had one of the most false judgments I have ever known, but was not lacking in a certain wit.","""You remind me, for it was exactly like this, of a seat that I had for many years until at last I couldn't keep it any longer because it had been given to my mother by the poor Duchesse de Praslin. My mother, though she was the simplest person in the world, really, had ideas that belonged to another generation, which even in those days I could scarcely understand; and at first she had not been at all willing to let herself be introduced to Mme. de Praslin, who had been plain Mlle. Sebastiani, while she, because she was a Duchess, felt that it was not for her to be introduced to my mother. And really, you know,"" Mme. de Villeparisis went on, forgetting that she herself did not understand these fine shades of distinction, ""even if she had just been Mme. de Choiseul , there was a good deal to be said for her claim. The Choiseuls are everything you could want; they spring from a sister of Louis the Fat; they were ruling princes down in Basigny. I admit that we beat them in marriages and in distinction, but the precedence is pretty much the same. This little difficulty gave rise to several amusing incidents, such as a luncheon party which was kept waiting a whole hour or more before one of these ladies could make up her mind to let herself be introduced to the other. In spite of which they became great friends, and she gave my mother a seat like that, in which people always refused to sit, just as you did, until one day my mother heard a carriage drive into the courtyard. She asked a young servant we had, who it was. ' The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, ma'am.' ' Very well, say that I am at home.' A quarter of an hour passed; no one came. ' What about the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?' my mother asked. ' Where is she?' ' She's on the stairs, ma'am, getting her breath,' said the young servant, who had not been long up from the country, where my mother had the excellent habit of getting all her servants. Often she had seen them born. That's the only way to get really good ones. And they're the rarest of luxuries. And sure enough the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld had the greatest difficulty in getting upstairs, for she was an enormous woman, so enormous, indeed, that when she did come into the room my mother was quite at a loss for a moment to know where to put her. And then the seat that Mme. de Praslin had given her caught her eye. ' Won't you sit down?' she said, bringing it forward. And the Duchess filled it from side to side. She was quite a pleasant woman, for all her massiveness. ' She still creates an effect when she comes in,' one of our friends said once. ' She certainly creates an effect when she goes out,' said my mother, who was rather more free in her speech than would be thought proper nowadays. Even in Mme. de La Rochefoucauld's own drawing–room people weren't afraid to make fun of her to her face (at which she was always the first to laugh) over her ample proportions. ' But are you all alone?' my grandmother once asked M. de La Rochefoucauld, when she had come to pay a call on the Duchess, and being met at the door by him had not seen his wife who was at the other end of the room. ' Is Mme. de La Rochefoucauld not at home? I don't see her. '—'How charming of you!' replied the Duke, who had about the worst judgment of any man I have ever known, but was not altogether lacking in humour.""","– That reminds me of an armchair, exactly like this one, which I had for a long time, but which I eventually had to be rid of, because it had been given to my mother by the ill-fated Duchesse de Praslin.35 You see, my mother, though she was quite the most unpretending person imaginable, had rather retained certain ways of seeing things which belonged to another period, and which even then I was beginning to find rather difficult to understand, and to begin with she had declined to be presented to Mme de Praslin, who was only Mlle Sebastiani-that-was, whereas Mme de Praslin, who was a duchess, took the view that it was not for her to be presented. And of course,’ added Mme de Villeparisis, forgetting that she found such social niceties rather difficult to understand, ‘had she been Mme de Choiseul proper, rather than just Mme de Choiseul-Praslin, her view might well have been able to prevail, since than the Choiseuls there are none greater – being descended from a sister of King Louis the Large, they were once true sovereigns in their ancient fiefdom of Bassigny. I must confess that we Bouillons take precedence, through our marriages and illustrious achievements, but in point of ancientness there is little difference in rank. So, that matter of protocol had given rise to certain comical incidents, such as a luncheon which was an hour late in starting, because one of these two ladies required to be persuaded that she should agree to be the one presented to the other. Despite all that, they had become firm friends, and she gave my mother an armchair of this very sort, in which, just like you, everyone was reluctant to sit. One day my mother heard a carriage arriving in the courtyard and asked of a servant lad who it was. “It’s Her Ladyship the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, Your Ladyship. – Fine, show her in.” A quarter of an hour later, there was still no sign of her. “So where’s Her Ladyship the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld? – She’s comin’ upstairs, Your Ladyship. Stopped for a breather, see,” replied the servant lad, who had only recently come up from the country, it being my mother’s sound practice to acquire them there. Many a time she had known them from birth. That’s how one gets good people. And good people are the first luxury in life. So, there was the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld painfully ascending, she being gigantic, so gigantic indeed that when she came in, my mother had a moment’s bother, as she wondered where she might seat her. That was when the armchair from Mme de Praslin caught her eye; so she moved it forward and said, “Do be so kind as to take a seat.” The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld filled it to overflowing. Despite being, shall I say, so imposing, she was still a perfectly agreeable person. One of our family friends used to say of her, “She still makes quite an effect when she arrives,” to which my mother would reply, “She makes an even greater one when she leaves.” My mother was freer in speech than would be thought proper nowadays. But even at her own house, no one felt inhibited about chaffing Mme de La Rochefoucauld on her inordinate proportions, and she laughed as readily as anyone. Once, when my mother went to visit her, having been welcomed at the door by the husband, she said to him, not having seen the Duchesse, who was sitting in an alcove, towards the back of the room, “Oh, are you all alone? Isn’t Mme de La Rochefoucauld at home? I don’t see her. – How kind you are!” the Duc replied, he being the man with the faultiest judgment I have ever known, but one who could rise to wit on occasion.’"
"Une fois je faillis me décider, mais elle était « sous presse », une autre fois entre les mains du « coiffeur », un vieux monsieur qui ne faisait rien d’autre aux femmes que verser de l’huile sur leurs cheveux déroulés et les peigner ensuite. Et je me lassai d’attendre, bien que quelques habituées fort humbles, soi-disant ouvrières, mais toujours sans travail, fussent venues me faire de la tisane et tenir avec moi une longue conversation à laquelle – malgré le sérieux des sujets traités – la nudité partielle ou complète de mes interlocutrices donnait une savoureuse simplicité. Je cessai du reste d’aller dans cette maison parce que, désireux de témoigner mes bons sentiments à la femme qui la tenait et avait besoin de meubles, je lui en donnai quelques-uns – notamment un grand canapé – que j’avais hérités de ma tante Léonie. Je ne les voyais jamais, car le manque de place avait empêché mes parents de les laisser entrer chez nous et ils étaient entassés dans un hangar. Mais dès que je les retrouvai dans la maison où ces femmes se servaient d’eux, toutes les vertus qu’on respirait dans la chambre de ma tante à Combray m’apparurent, suppliciées par le contact cruel auquel je les avais livrés sans défense ! J’aurais fait violer une morte que je n’aurais pas souffert davantage. Je ne retournai plus chez l’entremetteuse, car ils me semblaient vivre et me supplier, comme ces objets en apparence inanimés d’un conte persan, dans lesquels sont enfermées des âmes qui subissent un martyre et implorent leur délivrance. D’ailleurs, comme notre mémoire ne nous présente pas d’habitude nos souvenirs dans leur suite chronologique, mais comme un reflet où l’ordre des parties est renversé, je me rappelai seulement beaucoup plus tard que c’était sur ce même canapé que bien des années auparavant j’avais connu pour la première fois les plaisirs de l’amour avec une de mes petites cousines avec qui je ne savais où me mettre, et qui m’avait donné le conseil dangereux de profiter d’une heure où ma tante Léonie était levée.","Once I almost made up my mind, but it was ""in the press"", another time in the hands of the ""hairdresser"", an old gentleman who did nothing to women except pour oil on their loose hair and then comb. And I grew tired of waiting, although some very humble regulars, so-called workers, but still out of work, had come to make me some herbal tea and hold a long conversation with me in which – despite the seriousness of the subjects dealt with – the Partial or complete nudity of my interlocutors gave a tasty simplicity. I stopped going to this house because, wanting to show my good feelings to the woman who kept it and needed some furniture, I gave her some – notably a large sofa – which I had inherited from my aunt Leonie. I never saw them, because the lack of space had prevented my parents from letting them into our house and they were piled up in a shed. But as soon as I found them again in the house where these women made use of them, all the virtues which one breathed in my aunt's room at Combray appeared to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had delivered them up defenseless! I would have had a dead woman raped if I had not suffered more. I never went back to the go-between, for they seemed to me to live and beg me, like those seemingly inanimate objects in a Persian tale, in which souls are imprisoned who suffer martyrdom and implore their deliverance. Moreover, as our memory does not usually present our memories to us in their chronological sequence, but as a reflection where the order of the parts is reversed, I only remembered much later that it was on this same sofa that many years before I had known for the first time the pleasures of love with one of my little cousins with whom I did not know where to sit, and who had given me the dangerous advice to take advantage of an hour when my Aunt Leonie was up.","Once I was just making up my mind, but she was 'in the press,' another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place (working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work), had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, anxious to present a token of my good–will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt Léonie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt's room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy–tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt Léonie had left her room.","On one occasion I had almost decided to accept the offer; but the girl was ‘on the job’. Then another time she was with the ‘hairdresser’ (this was an old gentleman whose hairdressing consisted solely of oiling the women’s hair, once they had let it down, and then combing it for them). I tired of waiting for her, although several denizens of the establishment, of very humble charms, allegedly working-class women but always out of work, came up to make me a cup of tisane and engage me in a lengthy conversation to which, despite the seriousness of the subjects we talked about, their partial or total nakedness gave a piquant simplicity. However, I gave up going to that house, because in my desire to do the madam a good turn, she being rather short of furniture, I made her a present of some pieces, notably a large couch, which had been left to me by my Aunt Léonie. I rarely saw these things, since my parents, having no room to accommodate them, had put them into storage. But as soon as I set eyes on them again in that brothel, put to use by those women, I was assailed by all the virtues which had perfumed the air in my aunt’s bedroom at Combray, now defiled by the brutal dealings to which I had condemned the dear, defenceless things. I could not have suffered more if it had been the dead woman herself being violated. So I stopped going to that procuress’s establishment, as they seemed to be living creatures, crying out silently to me, like those apparently inanimate objects inside which, as a Persian tale has it, souls are imprisoned, subjected to constant torture and begging for ever to be freed. Moreover, given that memory does not usually produce recollections in chronological order, but acts more like a reflection which inverts the sequence of parts, it was not until much later that I remembered this was the couch on which, many years before, I had been initiated into the pleasures of love by one of my cousins, a girl whose presence embarrassed and excited me to distraction, and who had urged me to take perilous advantage of an hour when our Aunt Léonie was out of the room."
"– J’ai un autre volume de Bergotte ici, je vais vous le chercher, ajouta-t-il, et il sonna. Un groom vint au bout d’un moment. « Allez me chercher votre maître d’hôtel. Il n’y a que lui ici qui soit capable de faire une commission intelligemment, dit M. de Charlus avec hauteur. – Monsieur Aimé, monsieur ? demanda le groom. – Je ne sais pas son nom, mais si, je me rappelle que je l’ai entendu appeler Aimé. Allez vite, je suis pressé. – Il va être tout de suite ici, monsieur, je l’ai justement vu en bas », répondit le groom qui voulait avoir l’air au courant. Un certain temps se passa. Le groom revint. « Monsieur, Monsieur Aimé est couché. Mais je peux faire la commission. – Non, vous n’avez qu’à le faire lever. – Monsieur, je ne peux pas, il ne couche pas là. – Alors, laissez-nous tranquilles. – Mais, monsieur, dis-je, le groom parti, vous êtes trop bon, un seul volume de Bergotte me suffira. – C’est ce qui me semble, après tout. » M. de Charlus marchait. Quelques minutes se passèrent ainsi, puis, après quelques instants d’hésitation et se reprenant à plusieurs fois, il pivota sur lui-même et de sa voix redevenue cinglante, il me jeta : « Bonsoir, monsieur » et partit. Après tous les sentiments élevés que je lui avais entendu exprimer ce soir-là, le lendemain qui était jour de son départ, sur la plage, dans la matinée, au moment où j’allais prendre mon bain, comme M. de Charlus s’était approché de moi pour m’avertir que ma grand’mère m’attendait aussitôt que je serais sorti de l’eau, je fus bien étonné de l’entendre me dire, en me pinçant le cou, avec une familiarité et un rire vulgaires :","“I have another volume of Bergotte here, I will fetch it for you,” he added, and rang the bell. A bellhop came after a while. “Get me your butler. Only he here is capable of carrying out an intelligent errand, said M. de Charlus haughtily. ""Monsieur Aimé, sir?"" asked the bellhop. – I don’t know his name, but yes, I remember hearing him call Aimé. Go quickly, I'm in a hurry. ""He'll be here right away, sir, I just saw him downstairs,"" replied the bellhop, who wanted to seem informed. Some time passed. The groom returned. “Sir, Monsieur Aimé is in bed. But I can do the commission. - No, you just have to get him up. “Sir, I can't, he's not sleeping there. “Then leave us alone. ""But, sir,"" I said, ""the groom gone, you're too good, a single volume of Bergotte will suffice for me."" ""That's what it seems to me, after all. M. de Charlus was walking. A few minutes passed like this, then, after a few moments of hesitation and recovering himself several times, he turned on himself and, in his voice which had become scathing again, he called me: ""Good evening, sir"" and left. After all the lofty feelings I had heard him express that evening, the next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, in the morning, when I was going to take my bath, as M. de Charlus approached me to tell me that my grandmother was expecting me as soon as I got out of the water, I was very surprised to hear her say to me, pinching my neck, with familiarity and a vulgar laugh :","""I have another volume of Bergotte here; I will fetch it for you,"" he went on, and rang the bell. Presently a page came. "" Go and find me your head waiter. He is the only person here who is capable of obeying an order intelligently,"" said M. de Charlus stiffly. "" Monsieur Aimé, sir?"" asked the page. ""I cannot tell you his name; yes, I remember now, I did hear him called Aimé. Run along, I am in a hurry."" ""He won't be a minute, sir, I saw him downstairs just now,"" said the page, anxious to appear efficient. There was an interval of silence. The page returned. ""Sir, M. Aimé has gone to bed. But I can take your message."" ""No, you have only to get him out of bed."" ""But I can't do that, sir; he doesn't sleep here."" ""Then you can leave us alone."" ""But, sir,"" I said when the page had gone, ""you are too kind; one volume of Bergotte will be quite enough."" ""That is just what I was thinking."" M. de Charlus walked up and down the room. Several minutes passed in this way, then after a prolonged hesitation, and several false starts, he swung sharply round and, his voice once more stinging, flung at me: "" Good night, sir!"" and left the room. After all the lofty sentiments which I had heard him express that evening, next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, before noon, when I was on my way down to bathe, and M. de Charlus had come across to tell me that my grandmother was waiting for me to join her as soon as I left the water, I was greatly surprised to hear him say, pinching my neck as he spoke, with a familiarity and a laugh that were frankly vulgar:","‘I have another volume of Bergotte with me,’ he said as he rang the bell. ‘I’ll just get it for you.’ A page appeared, to whom M. de Charlus said haughtily, ‘Fetch me the butler, boy. He’s the only one round here who’s clever enough to run an errand. – Do you mean M. Aimé, Monsieur? asked the page. – I do not know the fellow’s name! But now you mention it, yes, I seem to remember he’s called Aimé. Look sharp – it’s urgent! – He’ll be here straight away, Monsieur. I saw him downstairs just now,’ said the page, wishing to appear efficient. After a moment, he came back: ‘M. Aimé is in bed, Monsieur. But I could do the errand instead. – No, you must get him out of bed. – Monsieur, I can’t. He doesn’t sleep at the hotel. – In that case, leave us. – Monsieur, I said when the page had left, you are too kind – a single volume of Bergotte will suffice. – Yes, I agree, actually.’ M. de Charlus was still striding up and down. Several minutes went by; then, after hesitating for a few moments and making as though to leave several times, he swung round and made his exit, calling out in his former scathing voice, ‘I bid you good evening, Monsieur!’ After all the elevated sentiments I had heard him express that evening, he amazed me on the beach the following morning: just before he was to leave Balbec, and as I was about to go in for a bathe, he came down to tell me my grandmother would like to see me as soon as I came out of the water, and, as he spoke, he pinched me on the neck, with a most vulgar laugh and air of familiarity:"
"Puis maman cherchait à me distraire, elle me demandait ce que je commanderais pour dîner, elle admirait Françoise, lui faisait compliment d’un chapeau et d’un manteau qu’elle ne reconnaissait pas, bien qu’ils eussent jadis excité son horreur quand elle les avait vus neufs sur ma grand’tante, l’un avec l’immense oiseau qui le surmontait, l’autre chargé de dessins affreux et de jais. Mais le manteau étant hors d’usage, Françoise l’avait fait retourner et exhibait un envers de drap uni d’un beau ton. Quant à l’oiseau, il y avait longtemps que, cassé, il avait été mis au rancart. Et, de même qu’il est quelquefois troublant de rencontrer les raffinements vers lesquels les artistes les plus conscients s’efforcent, dans une chanson populaire, à la façade de quelque maison de paysan qui fait épanouir au-dessus de la porte une rose blanche ou soufrée juste à la place qu’il fallait – de même le nœud de velours, la coque de ruban qui eussent ravi dans un portrait de Chardin ou de Whistler, Françoise les avait placés avec un goût infaillible et naïf sur le chapeau devenu charmant.","Then Mama tried to distract me, she asked me what I would order for dinner, she admired Françoise, complimented her on a hat and a coat which she did not recognize, although they had once aroused her horror when she had seen them new on my great-aunt, one with the huge bird surmounting it, the other laden with dreadful, jet-black designs. But the coat being out of order, Françoise had it turned over and exhibited a plain back of cloth in a beautiful tone. As for the bird, it had been discarded for a long time, broken. And, just as it is sometimes disturbing to encounter the refinements towards which the most conscious artists strive, in a popular song, at the facade of some peasant's house which causes a white rose to bloom above the door. or sulfured in just the right place – likewise the velvet bow, the ribbon shell which would have delighted in a portrait of Chardin or Whistler, Françoise had placed them with infallible and naive taste on the hat which had become charming.","Then Mamma sought to distract my mind, asked me what I thought of having for dinner, drew my attention to Françoise, complimented her on a hat and cloak which she did not recognise, in spite of their having horrified her long ago when she first saw them, new, upon my great–aunt, one with an immense bird towering over it, the other decorated with a hideous pattern and jet beads. But the cloak having grown too shabby to wear, Françoise had had it turned, exposing an 'inside' of plain cloth and quite a good colour. As for the bird, it had long since come to grief and been thrown away. And just as it is disturbing, sometimes, to find the effects which the most conscious artists attain only by an effort occurring in a folk–song, on the wall of some peasant's cottage where above the door, at the precisely right spot in the composition, blooms a white or yellow rose—so the velvet band, the loop of ribbon which would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler, Françoise had set with a simple but unerring taste upon the hat, which was now charming.","My mother then tried to distract me by asking what I was going to order for dinner, admiring Françoise, complimenting her on her hat and coat, which she had not recognized as ones which, when new and worn by my great-aunt, had once filled her with dismay, the hat because it had a huge bird perched on top of it and the coat because it was overloaded with jet and ghastly designs. But my great-aunt having cast off the coat, Françoise had had it turned and its inside now showed as a fine cloth in a handsome self-colour. The bird had long since been broken and thrown out. And, just as it is sometimes strange to notice refinements which the most deliberate artist might have to strive for, in a popular song or in a single white or yellow rose blooming at exactly the right spot on a peasant’s house, so with her sound and simple taste Françoise had placed on the hat, which was now a pleasure to behold, the velvet bow and the cluster of ribbon that would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler."
"Je répondais : « Non, non », et peut-être je ne sentais pas le froid, mais en tous cas je ne savais plus la peur de tomber malade, la nécessité de ne pas mourir, l’importance de travailler. Je donnais mon paletot ; nous entrions dans la salle du restaurant aux sons de quelque marche guerrière jouée par les tziganes, nous nous avancions entre les rangées de tables servies comme dans un facile chemin de gloire, et, sentant l’ardeur joyeuse imprimée à notre corps par les rythmes de l’orchestre qui nous décernait ses honneurs militaires et ce triomphe immérité, nous la dissimulions sous une mine grave et glacée, sous une démarche pleine de lassitude, pour ne pas imiter ces gommeuses de café-concert qui, venant chanter sur un air belliqueux un couplet grivois, entrent en courant sur la scène avec la contenance martiale d’un général vainqueur.","I answered: ""No, no"", and maybe I didn't feel the cold, but in any case I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the need not to die, the importance of working. I gave my overcoat; we entered the dining room to the sounds of some war march played by the gypsies, we advanced between the rows of tables served as if on an easy path to glory, and, feeling the joyful ardor imprinted on our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which awarded us its military honors and this undeserved triumph, we concealed it under a grave and icy mien, under a gait full of weariness, so as not to imitate those gummies of the café-concert who, coming to sing to a belligerent air a saucy couplet, come running on the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general.","""No, no,"" I assured him; and perhaps I did not feel the cold; but however that might be, I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the necessity of not dying, the importance of work. I gave up my coat; we entered the dining–room to the sound of some warlike march played by the gipsies, we advanced between two rows of tables laid for dinner as along an easy path of glory, and, feeling a happy glow imparted to our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which rendered us its military honours, gave us this unmerited triumph, we concealed it beneath a grave and frozen mien, beneath a languid, casual gait, so as not to be like those music–hall 'mashers' who, having wedded a ribald verse to a patriotic air, come running on to the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general.","To which I replied, ‘No matter.’ Perhaps I did not even feel the cold, but certainly I had lost all fear of being ill; and the need to protect myself against the possibility of dying, like the importance of getting down to work, had likewise vanished from my mind. I handed over the coat, we stepped into the dining-room, to the strains of a swashbuckling march played by the gipsies, and walked between the rows of laid tables as though we were conquering heroes; and, though we could feel in our bodies the thrill of exuberance communicated by the rhythms of the band, as it accorded us these military honours and an undeserved triumph, we hid it behind an appearance of glacial gravity and a world-weary gait, avoiding any suggestion of the type of swaggering songstress who performs in cabarets, strutting on to her little stage with the martial air of a victorious general, and launching into a bawdy adaptation of a marching-song."
"Quand Bloch me parla de la crise de snobisme que je devais traverser et me demanda de lui avouer que j’étais snob, j’aurais pu lui répondre : « Si je l’étais, je ne te fréquenterais pas. » Je lui dis seulement qu’il était peu aimable. Alors il voulut s’excuser mais selon le mode qui est justement celui de l’homme mal élevé, lequel est trop heureux en revenant sur ses paroles de trouver une occasion de les aggraver. « Pardonne-moi, me disait-il maintenant chaque fois qu’il me rencontrait, je t’ai chagriné, torturé, j’ai été méchant à plaisir. Et pourtant – l’homme en général et ton ami en particulier est un si singulier animal – tu ne peux imaginer, moi qui te taquine si cruellement, la tendresse que j’ai pour toi. Elle va souvent, quand je pense à toi, jusqu’aux larmes. » Et il fit entendre un sanglot.","When Bloch told me about the crisis of snobbery I was going through and asked me to admit to him that I was a snob, I could have replied: “If I was, I wouldn't date you. I just tell him he was unfriendly. So he wanted to apologize, but in the manner that is precisely that of the ill-bred man, who is only too happy in going back on his words to find an opportunity to aggravate them. “Forgive me, he said to me now each time he met me, I have upset you, tortured you, I have been wicked at pleasure. And yet – man in general and your friend in particular is such a singular animal – you cannot imagine, I who tease you so cruelly, the tenderness I have for you. She often goes, when I think of you, to tears. And he let out a sob.","When Bloch spoke to me of the crisis of snobbery through which I must be passing, and bade me confess that I was a snob, I might well have replied: ""If I were, I should not be going about with you."" I said merely that he was not being very polite. Then he tried to apologise, but in the way that is typical of the ill–bred man who is only too glad to hark back to whatever it was if he can find an opportunity to aggravate his offence. "" Forgive me,"" he used now to plead, whenever we met, ""I have vexed you, tormented you; I have been wantonly mischievous. And yet—man in general and your friend in particular is so singular an animal —you cannot imagine the affection that I, I who tease you so cruelly, have for you. It carries me often, when I think of you, to tears."" And he gave an audible sob.","When Bloch spoke of the fit of snobbery I must be having and invited me to own up to being a snob, I could have answered: ‘If I was a snob, I wouldn’t be mixing with you.’ But all I said was that it was not a very nice thing to say. He made an attempt at an apology; but it was of the sort often favoured by the ill-mannered man, who is glad to revisit words of his which have given offence, as it gives him the chance to compound the latter. ‘ Do forgive me, he would say thereafter. I was a brute, I was horrible to you, I revelled in being nasty to you. And yet, mankind in general and your good friend in particular being such a singular animal, you have no idea of the depth of affection for you harboured in this heart of mine. Though I tease you unmercifully, it has been known to move me to tears.’ These words he accompanied with a little sob."

"Si, pourtant, malgré tant de correspondances que je perçus dans la suite entre l’écrivain et l’homme, je n’avais pas cru au premier moment, chez Mme Swann, que ce fût Bergotte, que ce fût l’auteur de tant de livres divins qui se trouvât devant moi, peut-être n’avais-je pas eu absolument tort, car lui-même (au vrai sens du mot) ne le « croyait » pas non plus. Il ne le croyait pas puisqu’il montrait un grand empressement envers des gens du monde (sans être d’ailleurs snob), envers des gens de lettres, des journalistes, qui lui étaient bien inférieurs. Certes, maintenant il avait appris par le suffrage des autres qu’il avait du génie, à côté de quoi la situation dans le monde et les positions officielles ne sont rien. Il avait appris qu’il avait du génie, mais il ne le croyait pas puisqu’il continuait à simuler la déférence envers des écrivains médiocres pour arriver à être prochainement académicien, alors que l’Académie ou le faubourg Saint-Germain n’ont pas plus à voir avec la part de l’Esprit éternel laquelle est l’auteur des livres de Bergotte qu’avec le principe de causalité ou l’idée de Dieu. Cela il le savait aussi, comme un kleptomane sait inutilement qu’il est mal de voler. Et l’homme à barbiche et à nez en colimaçon avait des ruses de gentleman voleur de fourchettes, pour se rapprocher du fauteuil académique espéré, de telle duchesse qui disposait de plusieurs voix dans les élections, mais de s’en rapprocher en tâchant qu’aucune personne qui eût estimé que c’était un vice de poursuivre un pareil but, pût voir son manège. Il n’y réussissait qu’à demi, on entendait alterner avec les propos du vrai Bergotte ceux du Bergotte égoïste, ambitieux et qui ne pensait qu’à parler de tels gens puissants, nobles ou riches, pour se faire valoir, lui qui dans ses livres, quand il était vraiment lui-même, avait si bien montré, pur comme celui d’une source, le charme des pauvres.","If, however, in spite of so many correspondences which I perceived in the sequel between the writer and the man, I had not believed at the first moment, at Mme Swann, that it was Bergotte, that it was the author of so many of divine books that was in front of me, perhaps I had not been absolutely wrong, because he himself (in the true sense of the word) did not ""believe"" it either. He did not believe it since he showed great eagerness towards people of the world (without being a snob, moreover), towards men of letters, journalists, who were much inferior to him. Certainly, now he had learned by the suffrage of others that he had genius, compared to which the situation in the world and the official positions are nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it since he continued to feign deference towards mediocre writers in order to soon become an academician, whereas the Academy or the Faubourg Saint-Germain did not more to do with the part of the Eternal Spirit which is the author of Bergotte's books than with the principle of causality or the idea of God. This he knew too, as a kleptomaniac needlessly knows that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the goatee and the spiral nose had the tricks of a fork-stealing gentleman, to get closer to the hoped-for academic chair, to such a duchess who had several votes in the elections, but to get closer to it by trying only to no one who thought it a vice to pursue such a goal could see his trick. He succeeded only halfway, one heard alternating with the words of the real Bergotte those of the selfish, ambitious Bergotte who only thought of talking about such powerful people, noble or rich, to show off, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had shown so well, pure as that of a spring, the charm of the poor.","If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann's drawing–room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, 'believe' it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people (and yet he was not a snob), of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint–Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail–shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half–successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty.","However, though I was later to note many things common both to the writer and to the man, perhaps my very first impression of Bergotte was not quite wrong, that day at Mme Swann’s, when I doubted that the person standing in front of me could be the author of so many divine books, for he himself ‘disbelieved’ it too, in the true meaning of the word. He disbelieved it each time he fawned on fashionable people (not that he was a snob), or toadied to other writers or journalists, all of whom were clearly inferior to him. By now of course he knew about his genius from the plaudits of other people; and that knowledge is something beside which social position and official recognition are negligible. He knew all about his genius; but he disbelieved in it, going on feigning deference to mediocre writers, in the hope of being elected before long to the Académie française, although neither the Académie nor the Faubourg Saint-Germain have anything more to do with that share of the eternal Spirit which writes the books of a Bergotte than they have to do with the principle of causality or the idea of God. Bergotte was aware of that too, of course; but his awareness was as ineffectual as that of the kleptomaniac who knows that stealing is wrong. Like a lord who cannot help pocketing the cutlery, the man with the goatee and the bottle-nose had to creep up on the coveted seat in the Académie, by courting the duchess who commanded several votes in each of the elections, but in such a way as to prevent anyone who might think this aim unworthy of him from noticing what he was about. In this, he was only partly successful; and when he spoke, one could always hear, in among the real Bergotte’s words, other words spoken by the self-seeker, the man of ambition who was forever trying to impress people by dropping the names of the influential, the noble or the rich, despite having depicted in the books which he wrote when he was truly himself, as limpid as a spring, the charm of the poor."

"Un instant après je prenais congé de la « marquise », accompagné de Françoise, et je quittai cette dernière pour retourner auprès de Gilberte. Je l’aperçus tout de suite, sur une chaise, derrière le massif de lauriers. C’était pour ne pas être vue de ses amies : on jouait à cache-cache. J’allai m’asseoir à côté d’elle. Elle avait une toque plate qui descendait assez bas sur ses yeux leur donnant ce même regard « en dessous », rêveur et fourbe que je lui avais vu la première fois à Combray. Je lui demandai s’il n’y avait pas moyen que j’eusse une explication verbale avec son père. Gilberte me dit qu’elle la lui avait proposée, mais qu’il la jugeait inutile. « Tenez, ajouta-t-elle, ne me laissez pas votre lettre, il faut rejoindre les autres puisqu’ils ne m’ont pas trouvée. »","A moment later I took leave of the ""marquise"", accompanied by Françoise, and I left the latter to return to Gilberte. I saw him at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. It was so as not to be seen by her friends: we were playing hide and seek. I went to sit next to her. She wore a flat hat that came down quite low over her eyes, giving them that same dreamy, deceitful look that I had seen her the first time at Combray. I asked him if there was no way I could have a verbal explanation with his father. Gilberte told me that she had offered it to him, but that he considered it useless. ""Here,"" she added, ""don't leave me your letter, you must join the others since they haven't found me."" »","A moment later I said good–bye to the 'marquise,' and went out accompanied by Françoise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide–and–seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same 'underhand,' brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. ""Look,"" she went on, ""don't go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven't caught me.""","Having taken leave of the ‘countess’, I soon left Françoise to her own devices and went back to Gilberte. I saw her sitting on a chair behind the clump of laurels, so as to be invisible to her friends, with whom she was playing hide-and-seek. I sat beside her. She was wearing a flat toque, which almost covered her eyes and gave them the sly, unfocussed, evasive expression I remembered from the first time I had seen it at Combray. I asked her whether there might not be a way for me to talk this thing over with her father. Gilberte said she had already suggested this, and that he could see no point in it. ‘ Anyway, look,’ she said, ‘here’s your letter back. We’d better go back to the others now since nobody’s found me.’"
"Du reste, les personnes qui n’avaient pas seulement connu l’ancien Swann en dehors du monde, comme j’avais fait, mais dans le monde, dans ce milieu Guermantes, où, en exceptant les Altesses et les Duchesses, on était d’une exigence infinie pour l’esprit et le charme, où on prononçait l’exclusive pour des hommes éminents qu’on trouvait ennuyeux ou vulgaires, ces personnes-là auraient pu s’étonner en constatant que l’ancien Swann avait cessé d’être non seulement discret quand il parlait de ses relations mais difficile quand il s’agissait de les choisir. Comment Mme Bontemps, si commune, si méchante, ne l’exaspérait-elle pas ? Comment pouvait-il la déclarer agréable ? Le souvenir du milieu Guermantes aurait dû l’en empêcher, semblait-il ; en réalité il l’y aidait. Il y avait certes chez les Guermantes, à l’encontre des trois quarts des milieux mondains, du goût, un goût raffiné même, mais aussi du snobisme, d’où possibilité d’une interruption momentanée dans l’exercice du goût. S’il s’agissait de quelqu’un qui n’était pas indispensable à cette coterie, d’un ministre des Affaires étrangères, républicain un peu solennel, d’un académicien bavard, le goût s’exerçait à fond contre lui, Swann plaignait Mme de Guermantes d’avoir dîné à côté de pareils convives dans une ambassade et on leur préférait mille fois un homme élégant, c’est-à-dire un homme du milieu Guermantes, bon à rien, mais possédant l’esprit des Guermantes, quelqu’un qui était de la même chapelle. Seulement, une grande-duchesse, une princesse du sang dînait-elle souvent chez Mme de Guermantes, elle se trouvait alors faire partie de cette chapelle elle aussi, sans y avoir aucun droit, sans en posséder en rien l’esprit. Mais avec la naïveté des gens du monde, du moment qu’on la recevait, on s’ingéniait à la trouver agréable, faute de pouvoir se dire que c’est parce qu’on l’avait trouvée agréable qu’on la recevait. Swann venant au secours de Mme de Guermantes lui disait quand l’Altesse était partie : « Au fond elle est bonne femme, elle a même un certain sens du comique. Mon Dieu je ne pense pas qu’elle ait approfondi la Critique de la Raison pure, mais elle n’est pas déplaisante. – Je suis absolument de votre avis, répondait la duchesse. Et encore elle était intimidée, mais vous verrez qu’elle peut être charmante. – Elle est bien moins embêtante que Mme X (la femme de l’académicien bavard, laquelle était remarquable) qui vous cite vingt volumes. – Mais il n’y a même pas de comparaison possible. » La faculté de dire de telles choses, de les dire sincèrement, Swann l’avait acquise chez la duchesse, et conservée. Il en usait maintenant à l’égard des gens qu’il recevait. Il s’efforçait à discerner, à aimer en eux les qualités que tout être humain révèle, si on l’examine avec une prévention favorable et non avec le dégoût des délicats ; il mettait en valeur les mérites de Mme Bontemps comme autrefois ceux de la princesse de Parme, laquelle eût dû être exclue du milieu Guermantes, s’il n’y avait pas eu entrée de faveur pour certaines Altesses et si même quand il s’agissait d’elles on n’eût vraiment considéré que l’esprit et un certain charme. On a vu d’ailleurs autrefois que Swann avait le goût (dont il faisait maintenant une application seulement plus durable) d’échanger sa situation mondaine contre une autre qui dans certaines circonstances lui convenait mieux. Il n’y a que les gens incapables de décomposer, dans leur perception, ce qui au premier abord paraît indivisible, qui croient que la situation fait corps avec la personne. Un même être, pris à des moments successifs de sa vie, baigne à différents degrés de l’échelle sociale dans des milieux qui ne sont pas forcément de plus en plus élevés ; et chaque fois que dans une période autre de l’existence, nous nouons, ou renouons, des liens avec un certain milieu, que nous nous y sentons choyés, nous commençons tout naturellement à nous y attacher en y poussant d’humaines racines.","Moreover, the people who had not only known the old Swann outside the world, as I had done, but in the world, in this Guermantes milieu, where, excepting the Highnesses and the Duchesses, one was 'an infinite demand for wit and charm, where the exclusive was pronounced for eminent men whom one found boring or vulgar, these people might have been surprised to find that the old Swann had ceased to to be not only discreet when he talked about his relationships but difficult when it came to choosing them. How could Madame Bontemps, so common, so wicked, not exasperate him? How could he call her pleasant? The memory of the Guermantes milieu should have prevented him, it seemed; in fact he was helping her. There was certainly among the Guermantes, contrary to three-quarters of the worldly circles, taste, even refined taste, but also snobbery, hence the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of taste. If it was about someone who was not indispensable to this coterie, a Minister of Foreign Affairs, a somewhat solemn Republican, a talkative academician, taste was completely against him, Swann Madame de Guermantes complained of having dined alongside such guests in an embassy, and they preferred an elegant man a thousand times over, that is to say, a man from the Guermantes milieu, good for nothing, but possessing the spirit of the Guermantes. , someone who was from the same chapel. Only, if a Grand Duchess, a princess of the blood, often dined with Madame de Guermantes, she then found herself a part of this chapel too, without having any right to it, without in any way possessing its spirit. But with the naivety of people in the world, from the moment we received it, we contrived to find it pleasant, for lack of being able to tell ourselves that it was because we had found it pleasant that we received it. Swann, coming to the aid of Madame de Guermantes, said to her when the Highness had left: “Basically she is a good woman, she even has a certain sense of comedy. My God, I don't think she went into the Critique of Pure Reason, but she's not unpleasant. “I absolutely agree with you,” replied the Duchess. And still she was intimidated, but you will see that she can be charming. “She is much less annoying than Madame X (the talkative academician’s wife, who was remarkable) who quotes you twenty volumes. – But there is not even a possible comparison. The faculty of saying such things, of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and retained. He used it now with regard to the people he received. He strove to discern, to love in them the qualities which every human being reveals, if one examines him with a favorable prejudice and not with the disgust of the delicate; he highlighted the merits of Madame Bontemps as formerly those of the Princess of Parma, who should have been excluded from Guermantes circles, if there had not been an entry of favor for certain Highnesses and if even when it was a question of of them one would really have considered only the spirit and a certain charm. We have seen, moreover, in the past that Swann had the taste (which he now made only a more lasting application) of exchanging his social situation for another which in certain circumstances suited him better. It is only people who are unable to decompose, in their perception, what at first sight seems indivisible, who believe that the situation is one with the person. The same being, taken at successive moments of its life, bathes at different degrees of the social scale in environments that are not necessarily higher and higher; and each time in another period of existence, we tie, or renew, ties with a certain environment, that we feel pampered there, we quite naturally begin to attach ourselves to it by pushing human roots there.","Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar,—such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill–natured, failed to exasperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was 'of the same chapel' as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: ""After all, she's not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don't suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive."" ""Oh, I do so entirely agree with you!"" the Duchess would respond. ""Besides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming."" ""She is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X——"" (the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman) ""who quotes twenty volumes at you."" ""Oh, but there isn't any comparison between them."" The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice–minded; he extolled the merits of Mme. Bontemps, as he had once extolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been excluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination (which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion) to exchange his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one's position is consolidated with one's person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our existence, we form or re–form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils. In so far as Mme.","Also, the people who had known the former Swann not just in a private capacity, as I had, but also in society, in the world of the Guermantes – where the highest standards of wit and charm were expected of everyone, except duchesses and Highnesses, and where even eminent men might be unwelcome if they were seen to be boring or vulgar – might have been surprised to discover that not only had the former Swann turned into someone whose ways of referring to people he was acquainted with were indiscreet, but that his criteria for choosing such people were also quite lax. How was it possible for him not to be exasperated by Mme Bontemps, who was so common and nasty? How could he possibly say she was a pleasant person? His memories of the Guermantes set should surely have prevented it. But in fact they abetted it. The Guermantes, unlike three-quarters of the world’s social sets, certainly had taste, and exquisite taste at that. But they also had snobbery, which makes for the possibility of momentary failures in the functioning of taste. In the case of someone who was not an indispensable member of their set, a Minister for Foreign Affairs, say, rather too full of his own Republicanism, or a garrulous Academician, their taste discriminated against him; Swann would commiserate with Mme de Guermantes at her having had to dine with such commensals at an embassy; and the whole Guermantes set infinitely preferred a fashionable man, a man of their own world, that is, devoid of any special talent, but with the Guermantes cast of mind. However, a grand-duchess or a princess of royal blood, by dining frequently at the house of Mme de Guermantes, would also be seen as being in the set, although by her lack of the Guermantes cast of mind she was not of it. But with the naïvety of the fashionable, since she was one of their number, they did their best to think she was good company, rather than knowing that it was because she was good company that she was one of their number. ‘ She’s actually quite a nice woman,’ Swann would say in support of Mme de Guermantes, after H.R.H. had left. ‘And she’s even got a touch of comedy in her. I must say I doubt whether she has ever read the Critique of Pure Reason from cover to cover! Still, she’s not too bad. – I agree entirely, the Duchesse de Guermantes would reply. Mind you, today she was a little bit shy. But you’ll see, she can be quite charming. – She’s much less of a bore than Mme XJ (this being the wife of the garrulous Academician, a quite outstanding woman) who keeps spouting books at you. – Oh, there’s no comparison!’ It was at the Duchesse de Guermantes’s that Swann had acquired his facility in saying such things, which he said in all sincerity; and it was an ability he had kept. It served him now with the people who visited his wife. He tried hard to see in them, and to like, the qualities which any human being shows if examined with a favourable bias, and not with the disdain of the fastidious; and nowadays he stressed the merits of Mme Bontemps as he had once stressed those of the Princess of Parma, who would really have been unacceptable to the Guermantes set, had not certain Highnesses benefited from preferential treatment – and even if the ones admitted had been expected to possess wit and a little charm. As has been seen, Swann had once enjoyed exchanging his social position for one which, in certain circumstances, suited him better; and all he was doing at present was adapting this practice to a more lasting situation. It is only people who are incapable of perceiving the composite nature of what seems at first sight indivisible who think that person and position are one. The same man, seen on different rungs of the social ladder at consecutive moments of his life, belongs to separate worlds, each of which is not necessarily more elevated than the previous one; and every time a new phase of living brings us into, or back into, a certain social circle which welcomes us with open arms, we quite naturally start to put down roots and become attached to it."
"Il venait enfin de donner un dernier coup de pinceau à ses fleurs ; je perdis un instant à les regarder ; je n’avais pas de mérite à le faire, puisque je savais que les jeunes filles ne se trouveraient plus sur la plage ; mais j’aurais cru qu’elles y étaient encore et que ces minutes perdues me les faisaient manquer que j’aurais regardé tout de même, car je me serais dit qu’Elstir s’intéressait plus à ses fleurs qu’à ma rencontre avec les jeunes filles. La nature de ma grand-mère, nature qui était tout juste l’opposé de mon total égoïsme, se reflétait pourtant dans la mienne. Dans une circonstance où quelqu’un qui m’était indifférent, pour qui j’avais toujours feint de l’affection ou du respect, ne risquait qu’un désagrément tandis que je courais un danger, je n’aurais pas pu faire autrement que de le plaindre de son ennui comme d’une chose considérable et de traiter mon danger comme un rien, parce qu’il me semblait que c’était avec ces proportions que les choses devaient lui apparaître. Pour dire les choses telles qu’elles sont, c’est même un peu plus que cela, et pas seulement ne pas déplorer le danger que je courais moi-même, mais aller au devant de ce danger-là, et pour celui qui concernait les autres, tâcher au contraire, dussé-je avoir plus de chances d’être atteint moi-même, de le leur éviter. Cela tient à plusieurs raisons qui ne sont point à mon honneur. L’une est que si, tant que je ne faisais que raisonner, je croyais surtout tenir à la vie, chaque fois qu’au cours de mon existence, je me suis trouvé obsédé par des soucis moraux ou seulement par des inquiétudes nerveuses, quelquefois si puériles que je n’oserais pas les rapporter, si une circonstance imprévue survenait alors, amenant pour moi le risque d’être tué, cette nouvelle préoccupation était si légère, relativement aux autres, que je l’accueillais avec un sentiment de détente qui allait jusqu’à l’allégresse. Je me trouve ainsi avoir connu, quoique étant l’homme le moins brave du monde, cette chose qui me semblait, quand je résonnais, si étrangère à ma nature, si inconcevable, l’ivresse du danger. Mais même fussé-je, quand il y en a un, et mortel, qui se présente, dans une période entièrement calme et heureuse, je ne pourrais pas, si je suis avec une autre personne, ne pas la mettre à l’abri et choisir pour moi la place dangereuse. Quand un assez grand nombre d’expériences m’eurent appris que j’agissais toujours ainsi, et avec plaisir, je découvris et à ma grande honte, que contrairement à ce que j’avais toujours cru et affirmé, j’étais très sensible à l’opinion des autres. Cette sorte d’amour-propre inavoué n’a pourtant aucun rapport avec la vanité ni avec l’orgueil. Car ce qui peut contenter l’une ou l’autre ne me causerait aucun plaisir et je m’en suis toujours abstenu. Mais les gens devant qui j’ai réussi à cacher le plus complètement les petits avantages qui auraient pu leur donner une moins piètre idée de moi, je n’ai jamais pu me refuser le plaisir de leur montrer que je mets plus de soin à écarter la mort de leur route que de la mienne. Comme son mobile est alors l’amour-propre et non la vertu, je trouve bien naturel qu’en toute circonstance ils agissent autrement. Je suis bien loin de les en blâmer, ce que je ferais, peut-être, si j’avais été mû par l’idée d’un devoir qui me semblerait dans ce cas être obligatoire pour eux aussi bien que pour moi. Au contraire, je les trouve fort sages de préserver leur vie, tout en ne pouvant m’empêcher de faire passer au second plan la mienne, ce qui est particulièrement absurde et coupable, depuis que j’ai cru reconnaître que celle de beaucoup de gens devant qui je me place, quand éclate une bombe, est plus dénuée de prix. D’ailleurs le jour de cette visite à Elstir les temps étaient encore loin où je devais prendre conscience de cette différence de valeur, et il ne s’agissait d’aucun danger, mais simplement, signe avant-coureur du pernicieux amour-propre, de ne pas avoir l’air d’attacher au plaisir que je désirais si ardemment plus d’importance qu’à la besogne d’aquarelliste qu’il n’avait pas achevée. Elle le fut enfin. Et, une fois dehors, je m’aperçus que – tant les jours étaient longs dans cette saison-là – il était moins tard que je ne croyais ; nous allâmes sur la digue. Que de ruses j’employais pour faire demeurer Elstir à l’endroit où je croyais que ces jeunes filles pouvaient encore passer. Lui montrant les falaises qui s’élevaient à côté de nous, je ne cessais de lui demander de me parler d’elles, afin de lui faire oublier l’heure et de le faire rester. Il me semblait que nous avions plus de chance de cerner la petite bande en allant vers l’extrémité de la plage. « J’aurais voulu voir d’un tout petit peu plus près avec vous ces falaises », dis-je à Elstir, ayant remarqué qu’une de ces jeunes filles s’en allait souvent de ce côté. « Et pendant ce temps-là, parlez-moi de Carquethuit. Ah ! que j’aimerais aller à Carquethuit ! » ajoutai-je sans penser que le caractère si nouveau qui se manifestait avec tant de puissance dans le « Port de Carquethuit » d’Elstir tenait peut-être plus à la vision du peintre qu’à un mérite spécial de cette plage. « Depuis que j’ai vu ce tableau, c’est peut-être ce que je désire le plus connaître avec la Pointe du Raz qui serait, d’ailleurs, d’ici, tout un voyage. – Et puis même si ce n’était pas plus près, je vous conseillerais peut-être tout de même davantage Carquethuit, me répondit Elstir. La Pointe du Raz est admirable, mais enfin c’est toujours la grande falaise normande ou bretonne que vous connaissez. Carquethuit c’est tout autre chose avec ces roches sur une plage basse. Je ne connais rien en France d’analogue, cela me rappelle plutôt certains aspects de la Floride. C’est très curieux, et du reste extrêmement sauvage aussi. C’est entre Clitourps et Nehomme et vous savez combien ces parages sont désolés ; la ligne des plages est ravissante. Ici, la ligne de la plage est quelconque ; mais là-bas, je ne peux vous dire quelle grâce elle a, quelle douceur. »","He had finally just given his flowers a final brushstroke; I lost a moment looking at them; I had no merit in doing so, since I knew that the young girls would no longer be found on the beach; but I would have believed that they were still there and that these wasted minutes made me miss them that I would have looked at all the same, because I would have said to myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with young ladies. My grandmother's nature, a nature that was just the opposite of my total selfishness, was nevertheless reflected in mine. In a circumstance where someone who was indifferent to me, for whom I had always feigned affection or respect, only risked annoyance while I was in danger, I could not have done otherwise than to pity him for his boredom as something considerable and to treat my danger as nothing, because it seemed to me that it was with these proportions that things should appear to him. To say things as they are, it is even a little more than that, and not only not to deplore the danger that I myself was running, but to anticipate that danger, and for the one that concerned the others, on the contrary, even if I have more chances of being hit myself, try to avoid it. This is due to several reasons which are not to my credit. One is that if, as long as I was only reasoning, I thought I cared above all for life, each time during my existence I found myself obsessed with moral worries or only with nervous worries, sometimes so childish that I would not dare to report them, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, bringing for me the risk of being killed, this new concern was so light, relative to others, that I welcomed it with a feeling of relaxation which went as far as joy. I thus find myself having known, although being the least brave man in the world, this thing which seemed to me, when I resonated, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even were I, when there is one, and mortal, that presents itself, in an entirely calm and happy period, I could not, if I am with another person, not shelter him and choose for me the dangerous place. When a fairly large number of experiences had taught me that I always acted thus, and with pleasure, I discovered, and to my great shame, that contrary to what I had always believed and affirmed, I was very sensitive to the opinion of others. This kind of hidden self-esteem has nothing to do with vanity or pride. Because what can satisfy one or the other would cause me no pleasure and I have always refrained from doing so. But the people before whom I have managed to conceal most completely the little advantages which might have given them a less poor idea of me, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of showing them that I take more care in discarding the death of their road than of mine. As his motive is then self-love and not virtue, I find it quite natural that in all circumstances they act otherwise. I am very far from blaming them for it, which I would do, perhaps, if I had been moved by the idea of a duty which would seem to me in this case to be obligatory for them as well as for me. On the contrary, I find them very wise to preserve their lives, while not being able to prevent myself from putting mine in the background, which is particularly absurd and culpable, since I thought I recognized that that of many people who I stand in front of, when a bomb explodes, is more priceless. Moreover, on the day of this visit to Elstir, the time was still far away when I had to become aware of this difference in value, and it was not a question of any danger, but simply, a harbinger of pernicious self-esteem, not to seem to attach more importance to the pleasure that I so ardently desired than to the watercolourist's work that he had not finished. She finally was. And, once outside, I noticed that – so long were the days in that season – it was less late than I thought; we went to the dyke. What tricks I used to make Elstir stay where I thought these young girls could still pass. Showing him the cliffs that rose beside us, I kept asking him to tell me about them, in order to make him forget the time and make him stay. It seemed to me that we had more chance of identifying the small strip by going towards the end of the beach. “I would have liked to see those cliffs a little closer with you,” I said to Elstir, having noticed that one of the young girls often went that way. “And meanwhile, tell me about Carquethuit. Ah! How I would love to go to Carquethuit! I added without thinking that the new character which manifested itself so powerfully in Elstir's ""Port de Carquethuit"" was perhaps more the painter's vision than a special merit of this beach. “Since I saw this painting, this is perhaps what I most want to know about Pointe du Raz which would, moreover, be quite a journey from here. ""And even if it weren't nearer, I would perhaps recommend Carquethuit to you all the same,"" replied Elstir. The Pointe du Raz is admirable, but finally it is always the great Norman or Breton cliff that you know. Carquethuit is quite another thing with these rocks on a low beach. I don't know anything similar in France, it reminds me rather of certain aspects of Florida. It is very curious, and moreover extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme and you know how desolate these parts are; the line of beaches is lovely. Here, the line of the beach is arbitrary; but over there, I cannot tell you what grace she has, what sweetness. »","At last he had applied the final brush–stroke to his flowers; I sacrificed a minute to look at them; I acquired no merit by the act, for I knew that there was no chance now of our finding the girls on the beach; and yet, had I believed them to be still there, and that these wasted moments would make me miss them, I should have stopped to look none the less, for I should have told myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with the girls. My grandmother's nature, a nature that was the exact counterpart of my complete egoism, was nevertheless reflected in certain aspects of my own. In circumstances in which someone to whom I was indifferent, for whom I had always made a show of affection or respect, ran the risk merely of some unpleasantness whereas I was in real danger, I could not have done otherwise than commiserate with him on his annoyance as though it had been something important, and treat my own danger as nothing, because I would feel that these were the proportions in which he must see things. To be quite accurate, I would go even further, and not only not complain of the danger in which I myself stood but go half–way to meet it, and with that which involved other people try, on the contrary, were I to increase the risk of my being caught myself, to avert it from them. The reasons for this are several, none of which does me the slightest credit. One is that if, while only my reason was employed, I have always believed in self–preservation, whenever in the course of my existence I have found myself obsessed by moral anxieties, or merely by nervous scruples, so puerile often that I dare not enumerate them here, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, involving for me the risk of being killed, this new preoccupation was so trivial in comparison with the others that I welcomed it with a sense of relief, almost of hilarity. Thus I find myself, albeit the least courageous of men, to have known that feeling which has always seemed to me, in my reasoning moods, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even although I were, when any, even a deadly peril threatened me, passing through an entirely calm and happy phase, I could not, were I with another person, refrain from sheltering him behind me and choosing for myself the post of danger. When a sufficient store of experience had taught me that I invariably acted, and enjoyed acting, thus, I discovered—and was deeply ashamed by the discovery—that it was because, in contradiction of what I had always believed and asserted, I was extremely sensitive to the opinions of others. Not that this kind of unconfessed self–esteem is in any sense vanity or conceit. For what might satisfy one or other of those failings would give me no pleasure, and I have always refrained from indulging them. But with the people in whose company I have succeeded in concealing most effectively the slight advantages a knowledge of which might have given them a less derogatory idea of myself, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of shewing them that I take more trouble to avert the risk of death from their path than from my own. As my motive is then self–esteem and not valour, I find it quite natural that in any crisis they should act differently. I am far from blaming them for it, as I should perhaps if I had been moved by a sense of duty, a duty which would seem to me, in that case, to be as incumbent upon them as upon myself. On the contrary, I feel that it is eminently sensible of them to safeguard their lives, though at the same time I cannot prevent my own safety from receding into the background, which is particularly silly and culpable of me since I have come to realise that the lives of many of the people in front of whom I plant myself when a bomb bursts are more valueless even than my own. However, on the day of this first visit to Elstir, the time was still distant at which I was to become conscious of this difference in value, and there was no question of danger, but simply—a harbinger this of that pernicious self–esteem— the question of my not appearing to attach to the pleasure which I so ardently desired more importance than to the work which the painter had still to finish. It was finished at last. And, once we were out of doors, I discovered that—so long were the days still at this season—it was not so late as I had supposed; we strolled down to the 'front.' What stratagems I employed to keep Elstir standing at the spot where I thought that the girls might still come past. Pointing to the cliffs that towered beside us, I kept on asking him to tell me about them, so as to make him forget the time and stay there a little longer. I felt that we had a better chance of waylaying the little band if we moved towards the end of the beach. ""I should like to look at those cliffs with you from a little nearer,"" I said to him, having noticed that one of the girls was in the habit of going in that direction. "" And as we go, do tell me about Carquethuit. I should so like to see Carquethuit,"" I went on, without thinking that the so novel character which manifested itself with such force in Elstir's Carquethuit Harbour, might belong perhaps rather to the painter's vision than to any special quality in the place itself. "" Since I've seen your picture, I think that is where I should most like to go, there and to the Pointe du Raz, but of course that would be quite a journey from here."" ""Yes, and besides, even if it weren't nearer, I should advise you perhaps all the same to visit Carquethuit,"" he replied. "" The Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but after all it is simply the high cliff of Normandy or Brittany which you know already. Carquethuit is quite different, with those rocks bursting from a level shore. I know nothing in France like it, it reminds me rather of what one sees in some parts of Florida. It is most interesting, and for that matter extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme; you know how desolate those parts are; the sweep of the coast–line is delicious. Here, the coast–line is like anywhere else; but along there I can't tell you what charm it has, what softness.""","He had just put a final dab of paint on his flowers and I wasted another moment in looking at them. This wasting of a moment did not redound at all to my credit, as I knew that by now the girls would have left the beach; but even if I had known for sure that they were still there and that this waste of minutes would make me miss them, I would still have looked at the painting, as I would have told myself that Elstir’s flowers were more important to him than my meeting the girls. Though my grandmother’s nature was the exact opposite of my complete egoism, it could be reflected in mine. In a situation where someone who inspired indifference in me, but for whom I had always feigned affection or respect, might be caused some bother and I might be exposed to a danger , I would have been incapable of not sympathizing with him and treating his nuisance as something important, and the threat to me as unimportant, because that would be how I would imagine our respective positions seeming to him. To be precise, it was more than that: not just ignoring the danger I was in, but wilfully exposing myself to it, while trying to make sure, even if this increased my own chances of being harmed, that the other person would be able to avoid being put out. This can be explained by several reasons, none of which say much in my favour. One of them is that, though I have managed to reason myself, in theory, into the belief that I am attached to my own life, there have been times when, beset by emotional problems, or mere nervous anxieties, some of them so childish that I would not dare speak of them here, an unforeseen circumstance has arisen, bringing with it a risk of death for me, and this new consideration has actually appeared of such slight consequence to me, compared to the others, that I have welcomed it with a feeling of relief approaching exhilaration. Though I am the least intrepid man in the world, I have in this way experienced something which I had contrived to convince myself was so foreign to my nature as to be inconceivable: the intoxication of danger. But in the face of danger, mortal danger, even if I am going through a period of total calm and happiness, I would find it impossible not to shield someone else from it by putting myself in the dangerous position. Having learned from a significant number of experiences that I always acted in that way, and with pleasure, I discovered to my shame that, contrary to what I had always believed and affirmed, I was very sensitive to the opinions of others. Such unconfessed self-importance has no connection, however, with conceit or pride: the satisfactions afforded by either of these sentiments could never tempt me, and I have always abstained from them. But though I have always been able to conceal from certain people those petty advantages of my own which might have made them see me as slightly less paltry, I have never been able to resist the pleasure of letting them see that I am more concerned to avert death for them than for myself. My motive being self-esteem and not virtue, I see it as quite natural that their own behaviour in every situation should be quite different. I do not in the slightest blame them for this, as I might do if I had been motivated by a conception of duty, which would then appear to me to be as binding on them as on myself. On the contrary, I think it is entirely sensible of them to look out for themselves, though I cannot help subordinating my own interest to theirs, and though I must say this does appear singularly absurd and blameworthy, when I consider that the lives of many of those whose bodies I shield with mine when a bomb drops are even less valuable than my own. Anyway, at the time of my visit to Elstir, the day of my discovery of that difference in value was still far in the future; and there was no danger, but only the importance I saw (a forewarning of the pernicious self-esteem) in not appearing to think the pleasure I was longing for was more important than his task of finishing his water-colour. He finished it at last. As soon as we went outside, I noticed it was not as late as I had thought, the days being long at that time of year; and we walked down to the esplanade. I racked my brains to think of ways of keeping him near the place where I thought there was still a chance that the girls might appear. I pointed to the cliffs near by and kept asking him questions about them, in the hope of making him forget the time and keeping him there. I suspected we might have a better chance of catching up with the little gang if we went towards the far end of the beach. ‘Perhaps we could look at those cliffs from a little closer,’ I said, knowing that one of the girls often walked off in that direction. ‘ And as we walk, perhaps you could tell me about Carquethuit? How I would love to go to Carquethuit!’ I added, without thinking that what was so novel and powerful in Harbour at Carquethuit probably came from the vision of the painter rather than from some special quality in the place itself. ‘ Since seeing your painting, that’s the place I would really like to see – as well as the Pointe du Raz, of course, but that would be quite a journey from here. – In any case, Elstir said, even if it wasn’t nearer to Balbec, I’d still be inclined to recommend Carquethuit. The Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but it’s really just your typical tall cliffs on the coast of Normandy or Brittany, which you’re quite familiar with. But Carquethuit is completely different, with its rocks and its low sandy beach. I’ve never seen anywhere else like it in France – it looks more like somewhere in Florida. A most curious place, and very wild country too. In between Clitourps and Nehomme – you know what a wilderness all that part is, with the lovely line of the beaches. Hereabouts the line of the beaches is nondescript. But in those parts, it’s full of grace, very sweet.’"
"Ayant quitté mes parents, j’allai changer de vêtements et en vidant mes poches je trouvai tout à coup l’enveloppe que m’avait remise le maître d’hôtel des Swann avant de m’introduire au salon. J’étais seul maintenant. Je l’ouvris, à l’intérieur était une carte sur laquelle on m’indiquait la dame à qui je devais offrir le bras pour aller à table.","Having left my parents, I went to change my clothes and while emptying my pockets I suddenly found the envelope that the Swann butler had given me before entering the living room. I was alone now. I opened it, inside was a card on which I was told the lady to whom I should offer my arm to go to the table.","Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns' butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing–room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have 'taken in' to luncheon.","Having gone to my room, I was changing my clothes when I suddenly discovered in my pocket the envelope which the Swanns’ butler had handed me just before showing me into the drawing-room. Being no longer under the butler’s eye, I opened it – inside was a card on which was written the name of the lady whom I was expected to take in to lunch."
"– Comment, si c’est beaucoup ! s’écriait Swann qui préférait à cette modestie qui eût pu me laisser dans le doute un langage plus explicite. Mais c’est simplement le premier après le ministre ! C’est même plus que le ministre, car c’est lui qui fait tout. Il paraît du reste que c’est une capacité, un homme de premier ordre, un individu tout à fait distingué. Il est officier de la Légion d’honneur. C’est un homme délicieux, même fort joli garçon.","– How, if it is a lot! exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty which might have left me in doubt a more explicit language. But it is simply the first after the minister! It is even more than the minister, because it is he who does everything. It seems, moreover, that he is an ability, a man of the first order, a quite distinguished individual. He is an officer of the Legion of Honor. He is a delightful man, even a very pretty boy.","""I should think it did 'mean a lot'!"" exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more explicit mode of speech. ""Why it means simply that he's the first man after the Minister. In fact, he's more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He's an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good–looking too.""","‘Good, is it?’ Swann exclaimed, preferring plainer speech to such modesty, which might have left me in some doubt. ‘I’ll have you know he’s next in importance to the Minister himself! Or actually he’s more important than the Minister, because he’s the one who’s in charge of everything. I’m told he’s a man of calibre, too, a first-rate man, a really distinguished person. Officer of the Legion of Honour. A fine fellow in all respects, and actually very handsome too.’"
"J’allais et venais, impatient qu’il eût fini de travailler ; je saisissais pour les regarder des études dont beaucoup, tournées contre le mur, étaient empilées les unes sur les autres. Je me trouvais ainsi mettre au jour une aquarelle qui devait être d’un temps bien plus ancien de la vie d’Elstir et me causa cette sorte particulière d’enchantement que dispensent des œuvres, non seulement d’une exécution délicieuse mais aussi d’un sujet si singulier et si séduisant, que c’est à lui que nous attribuons une partie de leur charme, comme si, ce charme, le peintre n’avait eu qu’à le découvrir, qu’à l’observer, matériellement réalisé déjà dans la nature et à le reproduire. Que de tels objets puissent exister, beaux en dehors même de l’interprétation du peintre, cela contente en nous un matérialisme inné, combattu par la raison, et sert de contrepoids aux abstractions de l’esthétique. C’était – cette aquarelle – le portrait d’une jeune femme pas jolie, mais d’un type curieux, que coiffait un serre-tête assez semblable à un chapeau melon bordé d’un ruban de soie cerise ; une de ses mains gantées de mitaines tenait une cigarette allumée, tandis que l’autre élevait à la hauteur du genou une sorte de grand chapeau de jardin, simple écran de paille contre le soleil. À côté d’elle, un porte-bouquet plein de roses sur une table. Souvent et c’était le cas ici, la singularité de ces œuvres tient surtout à ce qu’elles ont été exécutées dans des conditions particulières dont nous ne nous rendons pas clairement compte d’abord, par exemple si la toilette étrange d’un modèle féminin est un déguisement de bal costumé, ou si au contraire le manteau rouge d’un vieillard, qui a l’air de l’avoir revêtu pour se prêter à une fantaisie du peintre, est sa robe de professeur ou de conseiller, ou son camail de cardinal. Le caractère ambigu de l’être dont j’avais le portrait sous les yeux tenait sans que je le comprisse à ce que c’était une jeune actrice d’autrefois en demi-travesti. Mais son melon, sous lequel ses cheveux étaient bouffants, mais courts, son veston de velours sans revers ouvrant sur un plastron blanc me firent hésiter sur la date de la mode et le sexe du modèle, de façon que je ne savais pas exactement ce que j’avais sous les yeux, sinon le plus clair des morceaux de peinture. Et le plaisir qu’il me donnait était troublé seulement par la peur qu’Elstir en s’attardant encore me fît manquer les jeunes filles, car le soleil était déjà oblique et bas dans la petite fenêtre. Aucune chose dans cette aquarelle n’était simplement constatée en fait et peinte à cause de son utilité dans la scène, le costume parce qu’il fallait que la femme fût habillée, le porte-bouquet pour les fleurs. Le verre du porte-bouquet, aimé pour lui-même, avait l’air d’enfermer l’eau où trempaient les tiges des œillets dans quelque chose d’aussi limpide, presque d’aussi liquide qu’elle ; l’habillement de la femme l’entourait d’une manière qui avait un charme indépendant, fraternel, et comme si les œuvres de l’industrie pouvaient rivaliser de charme avec les merveilles de la nature, aussi délicates, aussi savoureuses au toucher du regard, aussi fraîchement peintes que la fourrure d’une chatte, les pétales d’un œillet, les plumes d’une colombe. La blancheur du plastron, d’une finesse de grésil et dont le frivole plissage avait des clochettes comme celles du muguet, s’étoilait des clairs reflets de la chambre, aigus eux-mêmes et finement nuancés comme des bouquets de fleurs qui auraient broché le linge. Et le velours du veston, brillant et nacré, avait çà et là quelque chose de hérissé, de déchiqueté et de velu qui faisait penser à l’ébouriffage des œillets dans le vase. Mais surtout on sentait qu’Elstir, insoucieux de ce que pouvait présenter d’immoral ce travesti d’une jeune actrice, pour qui le talent avec lequel elle jouerait son rôle avait sans doute moins d’importance que l’attrait irritant qu’elle allait offrir aux sens blasés ou dépravés de certains spectateurs, s’était au contraire attaché à ces traits d’ambiguïté comme à un élément esthétique qui valait d’être mis en relief et qu’il avait tout fait pour souligner. Le long des lignes du visage, le sexe avait l’air d’être sur le point d’avouer qu’il était celui d’une fille un peu garçonnière, s’évanouissait, et plus loin se retrouvait, suggérant plutôt l’idée d’un jeune efféminé vicieux et songeur, puis fuyait encore, restait insaisissable. Le caractère de tristesse rêveuse du regard, par son contraste même avec les accessoires appartenant au monde de la noce et du théâtre, n’était pas ce qui était le moins troublant. On pensait du reste qu’il devait être factice et que le jeune être qui semblait s’offrir aux caresses dans ce provocant costume avait probablement trouvé piquant d’y ajouter l’expression romanesque d’un sentiment secret, d’un chagrin inavoué. Au bas du portrait était écrit : Miss Sacripant, octobre 1872. Je ne pus contenir mon admiration. « Oh ! ce n’est rien, c’est une pochade de jeunesse, c’était un costume pour une revue des Variétés. Tout cela est bien loin. – Et qu’est devenu le modèle ? » Un étonnement provoqué par mes paroles précéda sur la figure d’Elstir l’air indifférent et distrait qu’au bout d’une seconde il y étendit. « Tenez, passez-moi vite cette toile, me dit-il, j’entends Madame Elstir qui arrive et bien que la jeune personne au melon n’ait joué, je vous assure, aucun rôle dans ma vie, il est inutile que ma femme ait cette aquarelle sous les yeux. Je n’ai gardé cela que comme un document amusant sur le théâtre de cette époque. » Et avant de cacher l’aquarelle derrière lui, Elstir qui peut-être ne l’avait pas vue depuis longtemps y attacha un regard attentif. « Il faudra que je ne garde que la tête, murmura-t-il, le bas est vraiment trop mal peint, les mains sont d’un commençant. » J’étais désolé de l’arrivée de Mme Elstir qui allait encore nous retarder. Le rebord de la fenêtre fut bientôt rose. Notre sortie serait en pure perte. Il n’y avait aucune chance de voir les jeunes filles, par conséquent plus aucune importance à ce que Mme Elstir nous quittât plus ou moins vite. Elle ne resta, d’ailleurs, pas très longtemps. Je la trouvai très ennuyeuse ; elle aurait pu être belle, si elle avait eu vingt ans, conduisant un bœuf dans la campagne romaine ; mais ses cheveux noirs blanchissaient ; et elle était commune sans être simple, parce qu’elle croyait que la solennité des manières et la majesté de l’attitude étaient requises par sa beauté sculpturale à laquelle, d’ailleurs, l’âge avait enlevé toutes ses séductions. Elle était mise avec la plus grande simplicité. Et on était touché mais surpris d’entendre Elstir dire à tout propos et avec une douceur respectueuse, comme si rien que prononcer ces mots lui causait de l’attendrissement et de la vénération : « Ma belle Gabrielle ! » Plus tard, quand je connus la peinture mythologique d’Elstir, Mme Elstir prit pour moi aussi de la beauté. Je compris qu’à certain type idéal résumé en certaines lignes, en certaines arabesques qui se retrouvaient sans cesse dans son œuvre, à un certain canon, il avait attribué en fait un caractère presque divin, puisque tout son temps, tout l’effort de pensée dont il était capable, en un mot toute sa vie, il l’avait consacrée à la tâche de distinguer mieux ces lignes, de les reproduire plus fidèlement. Ce qu’un tel idéal inspirait à Elstir, c’était vraiment un culte si grave, si exigeant, qu’il ne lui permettait jamais d’être content, c’était la partie la plus intime de lui-même, aussi n’avait-il pu le considérer avec détachement, en tirer des émotions, jusqu’au jour où il le rencontra, réalisé au dehors, dans le corps d’une femme, le corps de celle qui était par la suite devenue Mme Elstir et chez qui il avait pu – comme cela ne nous est possible que pour ce qui n’est pas nous-même – le trouver méritoire, attendrissant, divin. Quel repos, d’ailleurs, de poser ses lèvres sur ce Beau que jusqu’ici il fallait avec tant de peine extraire de soi, et qui maintenant mystérieusement incarné, s’offrait à lui pour une suite de communions efficaces ! Elstir à cette époque n’était plus dans la première jeunesse où l’on attend que de la puissance de la pensée la réalisation de son idéal. Il approchait de l’âge où l’on compte sur les satisfactions du corps pour stimuler la force de l’esprit, où la fatigue de celui-ci, en nous inclinant au matérialisme, et la diminution de l’activité à la possibilité d’influences passivement reçues, commencent à nous faire admettre qu’il y a peut-être bien certains corps, certains métiers, certains rythmes privilégiés, réalisant si naturellement notre idéal, que même sans génie, rien qu’en copiant le mouvement d’une épaule, la tension d’un cou, nous ferions un chef-d’œuvre ; c’est l’âge où nous aimons à caresser la Beauté du regard, hors de nous, près de nous, dans une tapisserie, dans une belle esquisse de Titien découverte chez un brocanteur, dans une maîtresse aussi belle que l’esquisse de Titien. Quand j’eus compris cela, je ne pus plus voir sans plaisir Mme Elstir, et son corps perdit de sa lourdeur, car je le remplis d’une idée, l’idée qu’elle était une créature immatérielle, un portrait d’Elstir. Elle en était un pour moi et pour lui aussi sans doute. Les données de la vie ne comptent pas pour l’artiste, elles ne sont pour lui qu’une occasion de mettre à nu son génie. On sent bien, à voir les uns à côté des autres dix portraits de personnes différentes peintes par Elstir, que ce sont avant tout des Elstir. Seulement, après cette marée montante du génie qui recouvre la vie, quand le cerveau se fatigue, peu à peu l’équilibre se rompt et comme un fleuve qui reprend son cours après le contreflux d’une grande marée, c’est la vie qui reprend le dessus. Or, pendant que durait la première période, l’artiste a, peu à peu, dégagé la loi, la formule de son inconscient. Il sait quelles situations s’il est romancier, quels paysages s’il est peintre, lui fournissent la matière, indifférente en soi, mais nécessaire à ses recherches comme serait un laboratoire ou un atelier. Il sait qu’il a fait ses chefs d’œuvre avec des effets de lumière atténuée, avec des remords modifiant l’idée d’une faute, avec des femmes posées sous les arbres ou à demi plongées dans l’eau, comme des statues. Un jour viendra où, par l’usure de son cerveau, il n’aura plus, devant ces matériaux dont se servait son génie, la force de faire l’effort intellectuel qui seul peut produire son œuvre, et continuera pourtant à les rechercher, heureux de se trouver près d’eux à cause du plaisir spirituel, amorce du travail, qu’ils éveillent en lui ; et les entourant d’ailleurs d’une sorte de superstition comme s’ils étaient supérieurs à autre chose, si en eux résidait déjà une bonne part de l’œuvre d’art qu’ils porteraient en quelque sorte toute faite, il n’ira pas plus loin que la fréquentation, l’adoration des modèles. Il causera indéfiniment avec des criminels repentis, dont le remords, la régénération a fait l’objet de ses romans ; il achètera une maison de campagne dans un pays où la brume atténue la lumière ; il passera de longues heures à regarder des femmes se baigner ; il collectionnera les belles étoffes. Et ainsi la beauté de la vie, mot en quelque sorte dépourvu de signification, stade situé en deçà de l’art et auquel j’avais vu s’arrêter Swann, était celui où par ralentissement du génie créateur, idolâtrie des formes qui l’avaient favorisé, désir du moindre effort, devait un jour rétrograder peu à peu un Elstir.","I paced back and forth, impatient for him to finish working; I picked up studies to look at them, many of which, turned against the wall, were stacked on top of each other. I thus found myself bringing to light a watercolor which must have been from a much earlier time in Elstir's life and caused me that particular kind of enchantment which works dispense, not only of exquisite execution but also of a subject so singular and so seductive, that it is to it that we attribute part of their charm, as if, this charm, the painter had only had to discover it, to observe it, materially realized already in nature and reproduce it. That such objects can exist, beautiful even outside of the painter's interpretation, satisfies in us an innate materialism, combated by reason, and serves as a counterweight to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was – this watercolor – the portrait of a young woman, not pretty, but of a curious type, wearing a headband rather like a bowler hat edged with a ribbon of cherry silk; one of his gloved hands held a lighted cigarette, while the other raised to knee height a kind of large garden hat, a simple straw screen against the sun. Beside her, a bouquet holder full of roses on a table. Often, and this was the case here, the singularity of these works is above all due to the fact that they were executed in particular conditions which we do not clearly realize at first, for example if the strange toilet of a model feminine is a costume ball disguise, or if, on the contrary, the red coat of an old man, who seems to have put it on to lend himself to a whim of the painter, is his professor's or adviser's robe, or his cardinal's camail. The ambiguous nature of the being whose portrait I had before my eyes was due, without my understanding it, to the fact that it was a young actress from the past in half-travesty. But his melon, under which his hair was fluffy but short, his velvet jacket without lapels opening on a white breastplate made me hesitate about the date of the fashion and the sex of the model, so that I did not know exactly what I had before my eyes, if not the clearest of pieces of paint. And the pleasure he gave me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir lingering longer would cause me to miss the young girls, for the sun was already oblique and low in the little window. Nothing in this watercolor was simply noted in fact and painted because of its usefulness in the scene, the costume because the woman had to be dressed, the bouquet holder for the flowers. The glass of the bouquet holder, loved for its own sake, seemed to enclose the water in which the stems of the carnations dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; woman's dress surrounded her in a way that had an independent, brotherly charm, and as if the works of industry could compete in charm with the marvels of nature, as delicate, as savory to the touch of the gaze , as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a carnation, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the breastplate, as fine as sleet and whose frivolous pleating had bells like those of lily of the valley, starred from the bright reflections of the bedroom, themselves sharp and finely nuanced like bouquets of flowers which would have embroidered the laundry. And the velvet of the jacket, shiny and pearly, had here and there something bristling, ragged and hairy which made one think of the ruffled carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, heedless of the immorality of this transvestite of a young actress, for whom the talent with which she would play her part was doubtless less important than the irritating attraction that she was going to offer to the jaded or depraved senses of certain spectators, had on the contrary attached himself to these traits of ambiguity as an aesthetic element which was worth highlighting and which he had done everything to underline. Along the lines of the face, the sex looked like it was about to confess that it was that of a boyish girl, faded away, and further back found itself, rather suggesting the idea of a vicious and pensive young effeminate, then fled again, remained elusive. The character of dreamy sadness of the look, by its very contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of the wedding and the theater, was not what was the least disturbing. It was thought, moreover, that it must be artificial and that the young being who seemed to offer himself to caresses in this provocative costume had probably found it piquant to add to it the romantic expression of a secret feeling, of an unacknowledged grief. At the bottom of the portrait was written: Miss Sacripant, October 1872. I could not contain my admiration. "" Oh ! it's nothing, it's a sketch of youth, it was a costume for a variety show. All of this is a long way off. - And what happened to the model? An astonishment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir's face the indifferent and distracted expression which after a second he laid there. ""Here, pass me this painting quickly,"" he said to me, ""I hear Madame Elstir arriving and although the young person with the melon has played, I assure you, no role in my life, it is useless for my woman have this watercolor in front of her. I only kept this as an amusing document on the theater of that time. And before hiding the watercolor behind him, Elstir, who perhaps had not seen it for a long time, gave it an attentive look. ""I'll have to keep only the head,"" he murmured, ""the bottom is really too badly painted, the hands are from a beginner. I was sorry for the arrival of Mrs. Elstir who was going to delay us again. The window sill was soon pink. Our exit would be in vain. There was no chance of seeing the young girls, therefore it no longer mattered whether Mrs. Elstir left us sooner or later. She didn't stay very long. I found it very boring; she might have been beautiful if she had been twenty, driving an ox through the Roman countryside; but her black hair was turning white; and she was common without being simple, because she believed that solemnity of manners and majesty of attitude were required by her statuesque beauty, from which, moreover, age had deprived all its charms. It was dressed with the greatest simplicity. And one was touched but surprised to hear Elstir say on any occasion and with respectful gentleness, as if the mere fact of saying these words caused him tenderness and veneration: “My beautiful Gabrielle! Later, when I became acquainted with Elstir's mythological painting, Mrs. Elstir took on beauty for me too. I understood that to a certain ideal type summed up in certain lines, in certain arabesques which were constantly to be found in his work, to a certain canon, he had in fact attributed an almost divine character, since all his time, all the effort of a thought of which he was capable, in a word, he had devoted his whole life to the task of distinguishing these lines better, of reproducing them more faithfully. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was really a worship so serious, so exacting, that he never allowed him to be content, it was the most intimate part of himself, so never had he been able to consider it with detachment, to draw emotions from it, until the day he met it, realized outside, in the body of a woman, the body of the one who had subsequently become Mrs. he had been able – as it is possible for us only for what is not ourselves – to find it meritorious, touching, divine. What a rest, moreover, to lay one's lips on this Beauty that until now one had to extract from oneself with so much difficulty, and who now mysteriously incarnated, offered itself to him for a series of effective communions! Elstir at that time was no longer in his early youth when one expects only the power of thought to realize his ideal. He was approaching the age when one counts on the satisfactions of the body to stimulate the strength of the spirit, when the fatigue of the latter, by inclining us to materialism, and the diminution of activity to the possibility of passively received influences begin to make us admit that there are perhaps certain bodies, certain professions, certain privileged rhythms, realizing our ideal so naturally, that even without genius, just by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a neck, we would make a masterpiece; it is the age when we love to caress Beauty with our gaze, outside of us, close to us, in a tapestry, in a beautiful sketch by Titien discovered at a second-hand dealer, in a mistress as beautiful as the sketch by Titien . When I understood this, I could no longer see Madame Elstir without pleasure, and her body lost its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait of Elstir. . She was one for me and for him too, no doubt. The data of life do not count for the artist, they are for him only an opportunity to lay bare his genius. One senses, to see one next to the other ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are above all Elstir. Only, after this rising tide of genius which recovers life, when the brain gets tired, little by little the balance is broken and like a river which resumes its course after the counterflow of a high tide, it is life which takes over. Now, while the first period lasted, the artist gradually freed up the law, the formula of his unconscious. He knows what situations if he is a novelist, what landscapes if he is a painter, provide him with the material, indifferent in itself, but necessary for his research as a laboratory or a workshop would be. He knows that he made his masterpieces with effects of dimmed light, with remorse modifying the idea of a fault, with women posed under the trees or half immersed in water, like statues. . A day will come when, by the wear and tear of his brain, he will no longer have, faced with these materials which his genius used, the strength to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will nevertheless continue to seek them, happy to be near them because of the spiritual pleasure, the initiation of work, which they awaken in him; and besides surrounding them with a kind of superstition as if they were superior to something else, if in them already resided a good part of the work of art that they would carry in some way ready-made, it does not will go no further than attendance, the adoration of models. He will talk indefinitely with repentant criminals, whose remorse and regeneration have been the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a country where the mist attenuates the light; he will spend long hours watching women bathe; he will collect beautiful fabrics. And so the beauty of life, a word somehow devoid of meaning, a stage situated on this side of art and at which I had seen Swann stop, was that where, by slowing down the creative genius, idolatry of the forms which had favored, desire for the least effort, was one day to demote an Elstir little by little.","I paced up and down the room, impatient for him to finish what he was doing; I picked up and examined various sketches, any number of which were stacked against the walls. In this way I happened to bring to light a water–colour which evidently belonged to a much earlier period in Elstir's life, and gave me that particular kind of enchantment which is diffused by works of art not only deliriously executed but representing a subject so singular and so seductive that it is to it that we attribute a great deal of their charm, as if the charm were something that the painter had merely to uncover, to observe, realised already in a material form by nature, and to reproduce in art. That such objects can exist, beautiful quite apart from the painter's interpretation of them, satisfies a sort of innate materialism in us, against which our reason contends and acts as a counterpoise to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was—this water–colour—the portrait of a young woman, by no means beautiful but of a curious type, in a close–fitting mob–cap not unlike a 'billy–cock' hat, trimmed with a ribbon of cherry–coloured silk; in one of her mittened hands was a lighted cigarette, while the other held, level with her knee, a sort of broad–brimmed garden hat, nothing more than a fire screen of plaited straw to keep off the sun. On a table by her side, a tall vase filled with pink carnations. Often (and it was the case here) the singularity of such works is due principally to their having been executed in special conditions for which we do not at first sight make proper allowance, if, for instance, the strange attire of a feminine model is her costume for a masked ball, or conversely the scarlet cloak which an elderly man looks as though he had put on to humour some whim in the painter is his gown as a professor or alderman or his cardinal's cassock. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait now confronted me arose, without my understanding it, from the fact that she was a young actress of an earlier generation half dressed for a part. But the cap or hat, beneath which the hair stuck out but was cut short, the velvet coat opening without lapels over a white shirt–front, made me hesitate as to the period of the clothes and the sex of the model, so that I did not know what it was exactly that I was holding before my eyes, unless simply the brightest coloured of these scraps of painting. And the pleasure which it afforded me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir, by delaying further, would make me miss the girls, for the sun was now declining and hung low in the little window. Nothing in this water–colour was merely stated there as a fact and painted because of its utility to the composition, the costume because the young woman must be wearing something, the vase to hold the flowers. The glass of the vase, cherished for its own sake, seemed to be holding the water in which the stems of the carnations were dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; the woman's dress encompassed her in a manner that had an independent, a brotherly charm, and, if the works of man can compete in charm with the wonders of nature, as delicate, as pleasing to the touch of the eye, as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a flower, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the shirt–front, fine as driven rain, with its gay pleats gathered into little bells like lilies of the valley, was starred with bright gleams of light from the room, as sharply edged and as finely shaded as though they had been posies of flowers stitched on the woven lawn. And the velvet of the coat, brilliant with a milky sheen, had here and there a roughness, a scoring, a shagginess on its surface which made one think of the crumpled brightness of the carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, sublimely indifferent to whatever immoral suggestion there might be in this disguise of a young actress for whom the talent with which she would play her part on the stage was doubtless of less importance than the irritant attraction which she would offer to the jaded or depraved senses of some of her audience, had on the contrary fastened upon those ambiguous points as on an aesthetic element which deserved to be brought into prominence, and which he had done everything in his power to emphasise. Along the lines of the face, the latent sex seemed to be on the point of confessing itself to be that of a somewhat boyish girl, then vanished and farther on reappeared with a suggestion rather of an effeminate youth, vicious and pensive, then fled once more to remain uncapturable. The dreamy sadness in the expression of her eyes, by the mere fact of its contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of love–making and play–acting, was not the least disturbing element in the picture. One imagined moreover that it must be feigned, and that the young person who seemed ready to submit to caresses in this provoking costume had probably thought it effective to enhance the provocation with this romantic expression of a secret longing, an unspoken grief. At the foot of the picture was inscribed ""Miss Sacripant: October, 1872. "" I could not contain my admiration. "" Oh, it's nothing, only a rough sketch I did when I was young; it was a costume for a variety show. It's all ages ago now."" ""And what has become of the model?"" A bewilderment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir's face the indifferent, absent–minded air which, a moment later, he displayed there. "" Quick, give it to me!"" he cried, ""I hear Madame Elstir coming, and, though, I assure you, the young person in the billy–cock hat never played any part in my life, still there's no point in my wife's coming in and finding it staring her in the face. I have kept it only as an amusing sidelight on the theatre of those days."" And, before putting it away behind the pile, Elstir, who perhaps had not set eyes on the sketch for years, gave it his careful scrutiny. ""I must keep just the head,"" he murmured, ""the lower part is really too shockingly bad, the hands are a beginner's work. "" I was miserable at the arrival of Mme. Elstir, who could only delay us still further. The window sill was already aglow. Our excursion would be a pure waste of time. There was no longer the slightest chance of our seeing the girls, consequently it mattered now not at all how soon Mme. Elstir left us or how long she stayed. Not that she did stay for any length of time. I found her most tedious; she might have been beautiful, once, at twenty, driving an ox in the Roman Campagna, but her dark hair was streaked with grey and she was common without being simple, because she believed that a pompous manner and majestic attitudes were required by her statuesque beauty, which, however, advancing age had robbed of all its charm. She was dressed with the utmost simplicity. And it was touching, but at the same time surprising to hear Elstir, whenever he opened his mouth, and with a respectful gentleness, as if merely uttering the words moved him to tenderness and veneration, repeat: "" My beautiful Gabrielle!"" Later on, when I had become familiar with Elstir's mythological paintings, Mme. Elstir acquired beauty in my eyes also. I understood then that to a certain ideal type illustrated by certain lines, certain arabesques which reappeared incessantly throughout his work, to a certain canon of art he had attributed a character that was almost divine, since the whole of his time, all the mental effort of which he was capable, in a word his whole life he had consecrated to the task of distinguishing those lines as clearly and of reproducing them as faithfully as possible. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was indeed a cult so solemn, so exacting that it never allowed him to be satisfied with what he had achieved; was the most intimate part of himself, and so he had never been able to look at it from a detached standpoint, to extract emotion from it, until the day on which he encountered it realised outside, apart from himself, in the body of a woman, the body of her who in due course became Mme. Elstir and in whom he had been able (as one is able only with something that is not oneself) to find it meritorious, moving, god–like. How comforting, moreover, to let his lips rest upon that Beauty which hitherto he had been obliged with so great labour to extract from within himself, whereas now, mysteriously incarnate, it offered itself to him in a series of communions, filled with saving grace. Elstir at this period was no longer in that early youth in which we look only to the power of our own mind for the realisation of our ideal. He was nearing the age at which we count on bodily satisfactions to stimulate the forces of the brain, at which the exhaustion of the brain inclining us to materialism and the diminution of our activity to the possibility of influences passively received, begin to make us admit that there may indeed be certain bodies, certain callings, certain rhythms that are privileged, realising so naturally our ideal that even without genius, merely by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a throat, we can achieve a masterpiece, it is the age at which we like to caress Beauty with our eyes objectively, outside ourselves, to have it near us, in a tapestry, in a lovely sketch by Titian picked up in a second–hand shop, in a mistress as lovely as Titian's sketch. When I understood this I could no longer look without pleasure at Mme. Elstir, and her body began to lose its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait by Elstir. She was one for me, and for him also I dare say. The facts of life have no meaning for the artist, they are to him merely an opportunity for exposing the naked blaze of his genius. One feels unmistakably, when one sees side by side ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are all, first and foremost, Elstirs. Only, after this rising tide of genius, which sweeps over and submerges a man's life, when the brain begins to tire, gradually the balance is upset and, like a river that resumes its course after the counter–flow of a spring tide, it is life that once more takes the upper hand. While the first period lasted, the artist has gradually evolved the law, the formula of his unconscious gift. He knows what situations, should he be a novelist—if a painter, what scenes—furnish him with the subject matter, which may be anything in the world but, whatever it is, is essential to his researches as a laboratory might be of a workshop. He knows that he has created his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, the action of remorse upon consciousness of guilt, out of women posed beneath trees or half–immersed in water, like statues. A day will come when, owing to the exhaustion of his brain, he will no longer have the strength, when provided with those materials which his genius was wont to use, to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will yet continue to seek them out, happy when he finds himself in their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure, the allurement to work that they arouse in him; and, surrounding them besides with a kind of hedge of superstition as if they were superior to all things else, as if in them already dwelt a great part of the work of art which they might be said to carry within them ready made, he will confine himself to the company, to the adoration of his models. He will hold endless conversations with the repentant criminals whose remorse, whose regeneration formed, when he still wrote, the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a district where mists attenuate the light, he will spend long hours gazing at the limbs of bathing women; will collect sumptuous stuffs. And thus the beauty of life, a phase that has to some extent lost its meaning, a stage beyond the boundaries of art at which I had already seen Swann come to rest, was that also which, by a slackening of the creative ardour, idolatry of the forms which had inspired it, desire to avoid effort, must ultimately arrest an Elstir's progress.","I walked up and down, impatient for him to finish; of the many studies stacked against one another, face to the wall, I took up some and looked at them. So it was that I came upon a water-colour which must have dated from a much earlier time in the life of Elstir, and which made me feel that particular enchantment one gets from works which are not only painted to perfection, but the subject of which is so singular and delightful that we see it as accounting for much of the charm of the thing, as though the painter only had to notice this charm, study it as it stood before him fully present in the material reality of the natural world, then reproduce it. That such objects can exist, beautiful in themselves and without any painter’s interpretation of them, is something which satisfies an innate materialism in us, though resisted by reason, and serves as a counter-balance to the abstractions of aesthetics. The water-colour was the portrait of a young woman who, though not pretty, was of a curious type: she was wearing a close-fitting headdress, something like a bowler-hat edged with a ribbon of cerise silk; in one of her hands, which wore lace mittens, there was a lighted cigarette; and the other held at knee-height a sort of large garden hat, a mere screen of straw against the sunlight. On a table beside her, a little vase full of roses. Often, and it was the case here, the singularity of such works lies in the fact that they were executed in particular circumstances, which we do not clearly appreciate at first, for instance whether the odd get-up of a female model is in fact fancy dress worn for a ball, or whether the red robe worn by an old man, who looks as though he has just put it on at the passing whim of the painter, might not be his professor’s gown or his cardinal’s cape. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait I was looking at came from the fact, which I did not understand, that it was a young actress of an earlier period, partly cross-dressed. However, her bowler, set on hair that was puffed out but cut short, and her velvet jacket, without lapels and open on a white dickey, made me hesitate about the date of the fashion and the sex of the model, so that I could not tell what I was looking at, except that it was a brilliant piece of painting. My pleasure in it was mitigated only by the fear that Elstir might delay so long as to make me miss the gang of girls, for the sun was now angling very low through the little window. The water-colour contained nothing that served merely as a factitious accessory to the scene depicted (the costume, for instance, for no better reason than that the woman had to be wearing something, or the flower-holder, because there were flowers): the glass of the receptacle, lovingly seen in its own right, seemed to surround the water in which the stems of the carnations stood with a substance which was no less limpid and almost as liquid; the garments worn by the woman enclosed her in a material which had its own charm, independent, fraternal and, if man-made things can equal the charm of nature’s wonders, as delicate, as satisfyingly smooth to the eye’s touch and as neatly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a carnation or the feathers of a dove. The shirt-front, its white as fine as hail and its frivolous pleating smocked with little bells like lily-of-the-valley, shone with bright reflections from the room, themselves sharply seen and as delicately shaded as though there were flower motifs brocaded on the linen. The velvet of the jacket, which had a pearly lustre in its pile, was roughened in places, frayed and shaggy in a way which was like the ruffled carnations in their vase. One’s main impression was that Elstir, not only unconcerned about what might appear immoral in this young actress dressed like a man, who was herself less interested in how well she would play her part in the performance than in the fascination and stimulation she was bound to offer to the sensuality, surfeited or depraved, of certain spectators, had actually focussed on these points of ambiguity as an aesthetic element in his picture, which he had worked hard to bring out. In the lines of the face, the sex of the person seemed at times on the point of owning up to being that of a rather boyish girl, faded at others into the impression of an effeminate young man, perverted and pensive, then changed again, always elusive. In the look of the eyes, there was something wistful or forlorn which, in the contrast it made with the accessories from the worlds of the theatre and debauchery, gave a strange thrill. But one also felt that this look was affected, and that the young person in the provocative costume, seemingly asking to be fondled, must have thought there would be something even more intriguing in an expression suggestive of romantic or secret feelings, a hint of unspoken heartbreak. At the bottom of the picture were the words Miss Sacripant,89 October 1872. I could not contain my admiration. ‘Oh, that’s nothing – just a thing done by a young man. A costume from a pantomime at the Théâtre des Variétés. It’s all a very long time ago. – And what became of the model?’ At my question, his face showed surprise, which he replaced a moment later by a look of inattentive indifference. ‘Quick, let me have that canvas, he said. I can hear Mme Elstir coming. And though I can assure you the young creature in the bowler hat had no part to play in my life, it would be pointless to let my wife see this water-colour. I only kept it as an entertaining memento of the theatre of that period.’ Before hiding the work behind him, Elstir, who had perhaps not seen it for a long time, stared at it and murmured, ‘The head’s the only thing worth keeping. Those lower bits are dreadful. The hands are by a beginner.’ I was quite put out by the arrival of Mme Elstir, which was likely to make us delay even longer. The window-ledge soon turned pink. It would be futile to go out now: there was no longer the slightest chance of seeing the girls, and so it did not really matter whether Mme Elstir went away or stayed. In fact, she left again after only a short time. I thought her a bore: at twenty, leading a bullock in the Roman countryside, she would have been beautiful; but her black hair was turning white; and she was common but not simple in her manner, since she believed that a certain dignity of bearing and majesty of attitude were required by her mode of statuesque beauty, which had lost, in ageing, all its attractiveness. Her dress was striking in its utter simplicity. And it was touching and surprising to hear Elstir say, with great frequency and in a tone of caressing respect, as though by just speaking the words he was moved to tenderness and veneration, ‘My beautiful Gabrielle!’ At a later time, when I had become acquainted with his mythological paintings, I too came to see beauty in Mme Elstir; and I realized that, in a certain ideal pattern, the few outlines and arabesques of which could be seen to recur in his work over and over again, in a certain model of beauty, he had once seen something almost divine, since all of his time, the whole intellectual effort of which he was capable, in short the whole of his life, was devoted to the task of seeing those outlines more clearly and reproducing them more accurately. This ideal had become a form of worship, of such solemnity, and so demanding, that he could never be content; it was the innermost part of his self, and so he had never been able either to view it with detachment or to transform it into feelings, until the day when he came upon it externally manifested, in the body of a woman, who later became Mme Elstir, in whom he had at last been able – as we only ever are able, with that which is not part of ourselves – to see it as meritorious, moving and divine. What peace there was in placing his lips on Beauty, when until then he had had to drag it out of himself, create it in pain, but which now in a mysterious incarnation offered itself for a sequence of efficacious sacraments! By that time, Elstir had outgrown youth’s first confidence in the unaided power of thought to achieve the ideal. He was reaching the age at which one looks to the body and its fulfilments to stimulate the energy of the mind, when we are inclined by its weariness to materialism, by the lessening of its activity to the possibility of passively receiving influences, when we begin to accept that there may be certain bodies, certain professions, certain privileged rhythms which achieve our ideal very naturally, that even without genius, one can produce a masterpiece merely by copying the movement of a shoulder or the taut lines of a neck; it is the age at which we enjoy letting the caress of our eye rest on Beauty outside ourselves, close to us, on a tapestry, on a beautiful sketch by Titian discovered in an antique shop, or on a mistress every bit as beautiful as the sketch by Titian. Once I had come to understand this, I could never see Mme Elstir without pleasure; and her body lost all its ungainliness, for I filled it with an idea: that she was a creature of immateriality, a portrait by Elstir. And for Elstir too, that is what she was. The bare materials of life do not count for the artist; they merely offer him the opportunity to show his genius. Set side by side ten portraits of different people, all by Elstir, and their most flagrant feature is that they are Elstirs. But then, after the high tide of genius which once swamped the whole of life, once the brain has started to tire, gradually the equilibrium is lost, and like the flow of a great river beginning to prevail against the counter-flow of an exceptional tide, life reasserts itself. During his first period, the artist has managed to define the law, the formula, of his unconscious gift. He knows the situations, if he is a novelist, and the landscapes, if he is a painter, that can best provide him with the material which, though inessential in itself, is as indispensable to his research as a laboratory or a workshop. He knows he has made his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, remorse that changes the view of a wrong once done, women posed under trees or half-immersed in water like statues. A day will come when, with the onset of mental fatigue, he will face the materials which once served his genius, without finding in himself the intellectual vigour required for the creation of a work, yet will continue to seek them out and to enjoy their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure which, as the sometime spur of work, they still afford; and viewing them with a sort of superstition, as though they were superior to everything else, or as though they already contained a good part of the work of art, latent and ready-made, he will do no more than frequent and adore his subjects. He will continue to seek out rehabilitated criminals, whose remorse and repentance used to be the subjects of his novels; he will buy a country house in a region where the light is attenuated by mists; he will spend hours watching women bathing; he will become a collector of fine fabrics. So it was that, even for Elstir, a day would eventually come when he regressed to the attitude to beauty (which I had seen in Swann and beyond which he had never gone) implicit in the expression ‘the beauty of life’, a phrase almost devoid of meaning, suggesting beauty that never rises to art, a day when his creative genius would begin to dissipate, gradually giving way to idolatry, mere worship of the forms which had once nourished it and to the beguiling temptations of inertia."

"Pour ce qui est de « laïft », cela avait d’autant moins lieu de me surprendre que quelques jours auparavant, Bloch m’ayant demandé pourquoi j’étais venu à Balbec (il lui semblait au contraire tout naturel que lui-même y fût) et si c’était « dans l’espoir de faire de belles connaissances », comme je lui avais dit que ce voyage répondait à un de mes plus anciens désirs, moins profond pourtant que celui d’aller à Venise, il avait répondu : « Oui, naturellement, pour boire des sorbets avec les belles madames, tout en faisant semblant de lire les Stones of Venaïce, de Lord John Ruskin, sombre raseur et l’un des plus barbifiants bonshommes qui soient. » Bloch croyait donc évidemment qu’en Angleterre, non seulement tous les individus du sexe mâle sont lords, mais encore que la lettre i s’y prononce toujours aï. Quant à Saint-Loup, il trouvait cette faute de prononciation d’autant moins grave qu’il y voyait surtout un manque de ces notions presque mondaines que mon nouvel ami méprisait autant qu’il les possédait. Mais la peur que Bloch, apprenant un jour qu’on dit Venice et que Ruskin n’était pas lord, crût rétrospectivement que Robert l’avait trouvé ridicule, fit que ce dernier se sentit coupable comme s’il avait manqué de l’indulgence dont il débordait, et que la rougeur qui colorerait sans doute un jour le visage de Bloch à la découverte de son erreur, il la sentit par anticipation et réversibilité monter au sien. Car il pensait bien que Bloch attachait plus d’importance que lui à cette faute. Ce que Bloch prouva quelque temps après, un jour qu’il m’entendit prononcer « lift », en interrompant :","As for ""secularism"", that had all the less reason to surprise me than a few days earlier, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (it seemed to him, on the contrary, quite natural that he himself was there ) and if it was ""in the hope of making good acquaintances"", as I had told him that this trip fulfilled one of my oldest desires, though less profound than that of going to Venice, he had replied: ""Yes, of course, to drink sorbets with the beautiful ladies, while pretending to read the Stones of Venaice, by Lord John Ruskin, dark bore and one of the most barbifying fellows there is."" Bloch therefore evidently believed that in England not only all individuals of the male sex are lords, but also that the letter i is always pronounced ai. As for Saint-Loup, he found this error of pronunciation all the less serious in that he saw in it above all a lack of those almost worldly notions which my new friend despised as much as he possessed them. But the fear that Bloch, learning one day that they say Venice and that Ruskin was not a lord, would think in retrospect that Robert had found him ridiculous, made the latter feel guilty as if he had lacked indulgence. from which he was overflowing, and that the blush which would doubtless color Bloch's face one day on discovering his mistake, he felt by anticipation and reversibility rising to his own. Because he really thought that Bloch attached more importance to this fault than he did. Bloch proved this some time later, one day when he heard me pronounce “lift”, by interrupting:","At his use of the word 'lighft' I had all the less reason to be surprised in that, a few days before, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (although it seemed to him perfectly natural that he himself should be there) and whether it had been ""in the hope of making grand friends,"" when I had explained to him that this visit was a fulfilment of one of my earliest longings, though one not so deep as my longing to see Venice, he had replied: ""Yes, of course, to sip iced drinks with the pretty ladies, while you pretend to be reading the Stones of Venighce, by Lord John Ruskin, a dreary shaver, in fact one of the most garrulous old barbers that you could find."" So that Bloch evidently thought that in England not only were all the inhabitants of the male sex called 'Lord,' but the letter 'i' was invariably pronounced 'igh.' As for Saint–Loup, this mistake in pronunciation seemed to him all the less serious inasmuch as he saw in it pre–eminently a want of those almost 'society' notions which my new friend despised as fully as he was versed in them. But the fear lest Bloch, discovering one day that one says 'Venice' and that Ruskin was not a lord, should retrospectively imagine that Robert had been laughing at him, made the latter feel as guilty as if he had been found wanting in the indulgence with which, as we have seen, he overflowed, so that the blush which would no doubt one day dye the cheek of Bloch on the discovery of his error, Robert already, by anticipation and reflex action, could feel mounting to his own. For he fully believed that Bloch attached more importance than he to this mistake. Which Bloch proved to be true some time later, when he heard me pronounce the word 'lift,' by breaking in with:","The reference to the ‘lyfte’ had come as no surprise to me: a few days earlier, Bloch having asked me what I was doing in Balbec (he seemed to take it for granted that his own presence there was self-explanatory) and whether I was hoping to ‘pick up a few useful connections’, and as I had replied that my visit there was the fulfilment of one of my oldest dreams, not quite as strong, however, as my longing to see Venice, he said, ‘ Ah, yes, sitting about with the lovely ladies, sipping sherbet, pretending to read The Stones of Venyce of Lord John Ruskin – a moping monomaniac, by the way, and one of the crashingest bores ever invented.’ Bloch clearly thought that in England not only all individuals of the masculine gender were Lords, but that the letter i was always pronounced like a y. My new friend Saint-Loup looked on this mispronunciation as nugatory, tending to see it as indicating the mere absence of certain attributes of an elegant class, attributes which he dismissed with a scorn that was as profound as was his own mastery of them. However, his apprehension that one day Bloch would learn not only the proper pronunciation of ‘Venice’ but that Ruskin was no Lord, and that with hindsight he might suspect Robert of having thought him ridiculous, made Robert feel as guilty as though he had shown a lack of the considerateness which he actually had in abundance; and so, with foresight and his capacity for seeing himself as others might, he felt his own face colour with the blush which would darken Bloch’s face on the day when he discovered his mistake. He was pretty sure, of course, that Bloch would see it as much more important than he did. Bloch himself proved this some time later, when he overheard me speak of the ‘lift’ and interrupted me with, ‘I see – so it’s “lift”.’"

"Mais c’est peut-être encore celle au teint de géranium, aux yeux verts, que j’aurais le plus désiré connaître. Quelle que fût, d’ailleurs, tel jour donné, celle que je préférais apercevoir, les autres, sans celle-là, suffisaient à m’émouvoir ; mon désir même se portant une fois plutôt sur l’une, une fois plutôt sur l’autre, continuait – comme le premier jour ma confuse vision – à les réunir, à faire d’elles le petit monde à part, animé d’une vie commune qu’elles avaient, sans doute, d’ailleurs, la prétention de constituer ; j’eusse pénétré en devenant l’ami de l’une elle – comme un païen raffiné ou un chrétien scrupuleux chez les barbares – dans une société rajeunissante où régnaient la santé, l’inconscience, la volupté, la cruauté, l’inintellectualité et la joie.","But maybe it's still the geranium-skinned, green-eyed one that I would have most wanted to know. Whatever was, moreover, on a given day, the one I preferred to see, the others, without that one, were enough to move me; my very desire, focusing once more on one, once more on the other, continued – like my confused vision on the first day – to bring them together, to make them a little world apart, animated by a common life that they had, no doubt, moreover, the claim to constitute; I would have penetrated by becoming the friend of one of them - like a refined pagan or a scrupulous Christian among the barbarians - in a rejuvenating society where reigned health, unconsciousness, voluptuousness, cruelty, inintellectuality and joy.","But it was perhaps yet another, the one with geranium cheeks and green eyes, whom I should have liked most to know. And yet, whichever of them it might be, on any given day, that I preferred to see, the others, without her, were sufficient to excite my desire which, concentrated now chiefly on one, now on another, continued—as, on the first day, my confused vision—to combine and blend them, to make of them the little world apart, animated by a life in common, which for that matter they doubtless imagined themselves to form; and I should have penetrated, in becoming a friend of one of them—like a cultivated pagan or a meticulous Christian going among barbarians—into a rejuvenating society in which reigned health, unconsciousness of others, sensual pleasures, cruelty, unintellectuality and joy.","But I was not really sure whether the girl I would have preferred to know was not perhaps the one with the green eyes and the cheeks suggesting geraniums. And whichever one of them I chose to look out for on different days, the presence of the others, even without her, was enough to fill me with excitement: even if my desire bore on one of them some of the time and on another at other times, it went on seeing them all, as on the first day of my indistinct vision of them, as one, as a little world apart, living a single life, which was probably how they liked to see themselves; and if I could have become friends with only one of them, I would have gained access – like a refined pagan, or a Christian full of scruples, fallen among barbarians – to a whole society with powers of rejuvenation, a society based on rude health, recklessness, bodily pleasure, cruelty, non-intellectuality and joy."
"Pendant ces minutes où Gilberte, partie se préparer, n’était pas dans le salon avec nous, M. et Mme Swann se plaisaient à me découvrir les rares vertus de leur fille. Et tout ce que j’observais semblait prouver qu’ils disaient vrai ; je remarquais que, comme sa mère me l’avait raconté, elle avait non seulement pour ses amies, mais pour les domestiques, pour les pauvres, des attentions délicates, longuement méditées, un désir de faire plaisir, une peur de mécontenter, se traduisant par de petites choses qui souvent lui donnaient beaucoup de mal. Elle avait fait un ouvrage pour notre marchande des Champs-Élysées et sortit par la neige pour le lui remettre elle-même et sans un jour de retard. « Vous n’avez pas idée de ce qu’est son cœur, car elle le cache », disait son père. Si jeune, elle avait l’air bien plus raisonnable que ses parents. Quand Swann parlait des grandes relations de sa femme, Gilberte détournait la tête et se taisait, mais sans air de blâme, car son père ne lui paraissait pas pouvoir être l’objet de la plus légère critique. Un jour que je lui avais parlé de MlleVinteuil, elle me dit :","During those minutes when Gilberte, who had gone to get ready, was not in the drawing-room with us, M. and Mme. Swann took pleasure in revealing to me the rare virtues of their daughter. And everything I observed seemed to prove that they were telling the truth; I noticed that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends, but for the servants, for the poor, delicate attentions, long meditated upon, a desire to please, a fear of dissatisfying, resulting by little things that often gave him a lot of trouble. She had made a book for our merchant on the Champs-Élysées and went out through the snow to deliver it to her herself, and without a day's delay. “You have no idea what her heart is, because she hides it,” her father used to say. So young, she seemed far more reasonable than her parents. When Swann spoke of his wife's great connections, Gilberte turned her head away and was silent, but without an air of blame, for her father did not seem to her to be the object of the lightest criticism. One day when I had spoken to her about Mlle Vinteuil, she said to me:","During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to 'get ready,' was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some 'work' for our stall–keeper in the Champs–Elysées, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. ""You have no idea how kind–hearted she is, she won't let it be seen,"" her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife's grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:","While Gilberte had gone off to get ready to go out, M. and Mme Swann would sit with me in the drawing-room and enjoy telling me about the rare virtues of their daughter. Everything I could see of her for myself seemed to prove they spoke nothing but the truth. I noticed little acts of thoughtful kindness, which confirmed what her mother had said about how she treated not only her friends but the servants and the poor, and a desire to please, premeditated considerateness, a reluctance to give offence, all of which meant she often put herself out so as to do inconspicuous favours. She had done some embroidery for our barley-sugar woman at the Champs-Élysées, and made a point of taking it to her, though it was snowing, wanting to deliver it in person and without a day’s delay. Her father said, ‘I can tell you, that girl has a heart of gold, but she keeps it well hidden.’ Young as she was, she seemed much more sensible than her parents. When Swann spoke about his wife’s grand acquaintances, Gilberte would turn away and say nothing. But she did this without appearing to disapprove, as she felt it would be impossible to criticize her father in any way. Once when I mentioned Mlle Vinteuil, Gilberte said:"
"– Comme je ne peux pas supporter d’attendre parmi le faux chic de ces grands caravansérails, et que les tziganes me feraient trouver mal, dites au « laïft » de les faire taire et de vous prévenir de suite.","""As I can't bear to wait among the false chic of these grand caravanserais, and the gypsies would make me feel bad, tell the ""laift"" to shut them up and let you know right away.","""As I cannot endure to be kept waiting among all the false splendour of these great caravanserais, and the Hungarian band would make me ill, you must tell the 'lighft–boy' to make them shut up, and to let you know at once.""","‘Since the idea of kicking my heels among all the bogus gimcrackery of these palatial caravanserais is intolerable to me, and since gipsy orchestras make me feel ill, just tell the “lyfte” to make them be quiet and inform you without further ado of my presence.’44"
"Mais en tout genre, notre temps a la manie de vouloir ne montrer les choses qu’avec ce qui les entoure dans la réalité, et par là de supprimer l’essentiel, l’acte de l’esprit, qui les isola d’elle. On « présente » un tableau au milieu de meubles, de bibelots, de tentures de la même époque, fade décor qu’excelle à composer dans les hôtels d’aujourd’hui la maîtresse de maison la plus ignorante la veille, passant maintenant ses journées dans les archives et les bibliothèques, et au milieu duquel le chef-d’œuvre qu’on regarde tout en dînant ne nous donne pas la même enivrante joie qu’on ne doit lui demander que dans une salle de musée, laquelle symbolise bien mieux, par sa nudité et son dépouillement de toutes particularités, les espaces intérieurs où l’artiste s’est abstrait pour créer.","But in all genres, our time has a mania for wanting to show things only with what surrounds them in reality, and thereby suppressing the essential, the act of the mind, which isolated them from it. . We ""present"" a picture in the middle of furniture, knick-knacks, hangings from the same period, a bland decor that the most ignorant hostess of the house excels in composing the day before, now spending her days in archives and libraries, and in the midst of which the masterpiece that we look at while dining does not give us the same intoxicating joy that we should only ask of it in a museum room, which symbolizes much better , by its nudity and its stripping of all particularities, the interior spaces where the artist has abstracted himself to create.","But in this respect as in every other, our age is infected with a mania for shewing things only in the environment that properly belongs to them, thereby suppressing the essential thing, the act of the mind which isolated them from that environment. A picture is nowadays 'presented' in the midst of furniture, ornaments, hangings of the same period, a second–hand scheme of decoration in the composition of which in the houses of to–day excels that same hostess who but yesterday was so crassly ignorant, but now spends her time poring over records and in libraries; and among these the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table while we dine does not give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it only in a public gallery, which symbolises far better by its bareness, by the absence of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it.","But then in all sorts of ways, our age is plagued by the notion that objects should be shown only with things which accompany them in reality, thus depriving them of the essential, that act of mind which isolated them from reality in the first place. So a painting is ‘featured’ amid furniture, knick-knacks or hangings from the same period, the sort of insipid interior decoration which yesterday’s ignoramus among hostesses, who now spends her idle hours in the archives and the libraries, is today adept at composing, and among which the masterpiece that we glance at as we dine does not give us the intensity of pleasure we more rightly expect from it in an art gallery, where the bareness of walls unadorned by any distracting detail symbolizes much more aptly the inner spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it."

"Ce premier jour où je le vis chez les parents de Gilberte, je racontai à Bergotte que j’avais entendu récemment la Berma dans Phèdre ; il me dit que dans la scène où elle reste le bras levé à la hauteur de l’épaule – précisément une des scènes où on avait tant applaudi – elle avait su évoquer avec un art très noble des chefs-d’œuvre qu’elle n’avait peut-être d’ailleurs jamais vus, une Hespéride qui fait ce geste sur une métope d’Olympie, et aussi les belles vierges de l’ancien Éréchthéion.","That first day when I saw him with Gilberte's parents, I told Bergotte that I had recently heard La Berma in Phèdre; he told me that in the scene where she remains with her arm raised at shoulder height – precisely one of the scenes in which there had been so much applause – she had been able to evoke with a very noble art masterpieces that she never knew. He had perhaps never seen a Hesperides making this gesture on a metope from Olympia, and also the beautiful virgins of the ancient Erechtheion.","That first day on which I met him with Gilberte's parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Phèdre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder—one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause—she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum.","On that occasion when I first met Bergotte at the house of Gilberte’s parents, I told him I had recently been to see La Berma in Phèdre, to which he replied that in the scene where she stood with one arm outstretched at shoulder-height – one of the scenes which the audience had acclaimed – the nobility of her acting had managed to call to mind masterpieces which she might actually never have seen, a Hesperid making that very gesture on a metope at Olympia and the beautiful maidens from the older Erechtheum."

"Swann était un de ces hommes qui, ayant vécu longtemps dans les illusions de l’amour, ont vu le bien-être qu’ils ont donné à nombre de femmes accroître le bonheur de celles-ci sans créer de leur part aucune reconnaissance, aucune tendresse envers eux ; mais dans leur enfant ils croient sentir une affection qui, incarnée dans leur nom même, les fera durer après leur mort. Quand il n’y aurait plus de Charles Swann, il y aurait encore une Mlle Swann, ou une Mme X., née Swann, qui continuerait à aimer le père disparu. Même à l’aimer trop peut-être, pensait sans doute Swann, car il répondit à Gilberte : « Tu es une bonne fille » de ce ton attendri par l’inquiétude que nous inspire, pour l’avenir, la tendresse trop passionnée d’un être destiné à nous survivre. Pour dissimuler son émotion, il se mêla à notre conversation sur la Berma. Il me fit remarquer, mais d’un ton détaché, ennuyé, comme s’il voulait rester en quelque sorte en dehors de ce qu’il disait, avec quelle intelligence, quelle justesse imprévue l’actrice disait à Œnone : « Tu le savais ! » Il avait raison : cette intonation-là du moins, avait une valeur vraiment intelligible et aurait pu par là satisfaire à mon désir de trouver des raisons irréfutables d’admirer la Berma. Mais c’est à cause de sa clarté même qu’elle ne le contentait point. L’intonation était si ingénieuse, d’une intention, d’un sens si définis, qu’elle semblait exister en elle-même et que toute artiste intelligente eût pu l’acquérir. C’était une belle idée ; mais quiconque la concevrait aussi pleinement la posséderait de même. Il restait à la Berma qu’elle l’avait trouvée, mais peut-on employer ce mot de « trouver » quand il s’agit de quelque chose qui ne serait pas différent si on l’avait reçu, quelque chose qui ne tient pas essentiellement à votre être, puisqu’un autre peut ensuite le reproduire ?","Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time in the illusions of love, saw the well-being they gave to a number of women increase their happiness without creating on their part any recognition, any tenderness towards them; but in their child they believe they sense an affection which, embodied in their very name, will make them last after their death. When there would be no more Charles Swann, there would still be a Miss Swann, or a Mrs. X., née Swann, who would continue to love the deceased father. Even loving her perhaps too much, Swann no doubt thought, for he replied to Gilberte: ""You are a good girl"" in that tone softened by the anxiety that the too passionate tenderness of her husband inspires in us for the future. a being destined to outlive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our conversation about the Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, bored tone, as if he wanted to somehow stay outside of what he was saying, with what intelligence, what unforeseen accuracy the actress said to Œnone: ""You knew it. ! He was right: that intonation at least, had a really intelligible value and could have thereby satisfied my desire to find irrefutable reasons to admire Berma. But it was because of its very clarity that it did not satisfy him. The intonation was so ingenious, of such definite intention and meaning, that it seemed to exist in itself and any intelligent artist could have acquired it. It was a nice idea; but whoever conceived it so fully would possess it as well. It remained to Berma that she had found it, but can one use this word ""find"" when it is a question of something which would not be different if one had received it, something which does not hold? essentially to your being, since another can then reproduce it?","Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something–else, née Swann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte's caress with a ""Good girl!"" in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Œnone, ""You knew it!"" He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to exist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma's credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word 'discover' when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one's own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it? ""Upon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!""","Swann was one of those men whose lives have been spent in the illusions of love, who, having afforded comforts and, through them, greater happiness to many women, have not been repaid by gratitude or tenderness towards themselves; but in their child they believe they can sense an affection which, by being materialized in the name they bear, will outlive them. A time would come when Charles Swann would have ceased to exist, but there would still be a Mlle Swann or a Mme X, née Swann, who would go on loving her dead father. Swann may even have thought Gilberte would love him too much, for he said to her now, in that emotional voice full of misgiving about the future of someone whose love for us is too passionate, and who is bound to live on after our death, ‘What a good girl you are.’ To conceal the fact that he was moved, he joined in the conversation about La Berma, pointing out to me, albeit in a detached, bored tone that sounded as though he was trying to remain at a distance from what he was saying, the actress’s percipience, the unexpected aptness of the way she had spoken to Oenone the words: ‘You knew about it!’ He was right: that intonation at any rate did convey a genuine and manifest effect, and should therefore have satisfied my desire to find irrefutable reasons for admiring La Berma. But it did not satisfy it, because of its very transparency. Her intonation had been so perceptive, so clear in its meaning and intent, that it seemed to exist in its own right, and any clever actress should have been able to think of it. It certainly was an inspired piece of acting; but anybody capable of grasping it so clearly would also have been capable of producing it. The fact remained that it was La Berma who had thought of it – but could she really be said to have ‘invented’ it, when the thing supposedly invented would have been no different if she had merely acquired it, a thing bearing no essential relation to her self, since it could be reproduced by someone else? ‘Goodness me!’"

"Or, un hasard mit tout d’un coup entre nos mains le moyen de nous donner à ma grand’mère et à moi, pour tous les habitants de l’hôtel, un prestige immédiat. En effet, dès ce premier jour, au moment où la vieille dame descendait de chez elle, exerçant, grâce au valet de pied qui la précédait, à la femme de chambre qui courait derrière avec un livre et une couverture oubliés, une action sur les âmes et excitant chez tous une curiosité et un respect auxquels il fut visible qu’échappait moins que personne M. de Stermaria, le directeur se pencha vers ma grand’mère, et par amabilité (comme on montre le Shah de Perse ou la Reine Ranavalo à un spectateur obscur qui ne peut évidemment avoir aucune relation avec le puissant souverain, mais peut trouver intéressant de l’avoir vu à quelques pas), il lui coula dans l’oreille : « La Marquise de Villeparisis », cependant qu’au même moment cette dame apercevant ma grand’mère ne pouvait retenir un regard de joyeuse surprise.","Now, chance suddenly placed in our hands the means of giving my grandmother and me, for all the inhabitants of the hotel, an immediate prestige.

On our very first day there, as the old lady came down from her apartments, radiating an influence, through the footman before her and the maidservant scurrying after with a forgotten book and blanket, which affected every mind, inspiring curiosity and respect in all, visibly more so in M. de Stermaria than in anyone else, the manager leaned towards my grandmother and in a kindly way, as one points out the Shah of Persia or Queen Ranavalo of Madagascar to some obscure by-stander, who cannot possibly have the slightest link with the potentate but may be intrigued to realize who it is passing by, murmured to her, ‘The Marquise de Villeparisis’, and at that very moment the old lady, catching sight of my grandmother, gave a start of joy and surprise."
"Une fois que nous connûmes cette vieille route, pour changer, nous revînmes, à moins que nous ne l’eussions prise à l’aller, par une autre qui traversait les bois de Chantereine et de Canteloup. L’invisibilité des innombrables oiseaux qui s’y répondaient tout à côté de nous dans les arbres donnait la même impression de repos qu’on a les yeux fermés. Enchaîné à mon strapontin comme Prométhée sur son rocher, j’écoutais mes Océanides. Et, quand, par hasard, j’apercevais l’un de ces oiseaux qui passait d’une feuille sous une autre, il y avait si peu de lien apparent entre lui et ces chants que je ne croyais pas voir la cause de ceux-ci dans ce petit corps sautillant, étonné et sans regard.","Once we knew this old road, for a change, we returned, unless we had taken it on the outward journey, by another which crossed the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the innumerable birds that responded to it right next to us in the trees gave the same impression of rest that we have with our eyes closed. Chained to my folding seat like Prometheus on his rock, I listened to my Océanides. And when, by chance, I saw one of these birds passing from one leaf under another, there was so little apparent connection between it and these songs that I did not think I saw the cause of them. here in this little hopping body, astonished and without gaze.","Once we had got to know this road, for a change we would return— that is, if we had not taken it on the outward journey—by another which ran through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the numberless birds that took up one another's song close beside us in the trees gave me the same sense of being at rest that one has when one shuts one's eyes. Chained to my back–seat like Prometheus on his rock I listened to my Oceanides. And when it so happened that I caught a glimpse of one of those birds as it passed from one leaf to another, there was so little apparent connexion between it and the songs that I heard that I could not believe that I was beholding their cause in that little body, fluttering, startled and unseeing.","For the sake of variety, once we had become used to this old back road, we would make a point of driving home by another route (unless we had taken it on our way out) which took us through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the countless birds very close at hand calling to each other among the trees gave the same restful impression as one can have by closing one’s eyes. Bound to my little folding-seat, like Prometheus to his rock, I listened to my Oceanides. And if I chanced to see one of these birds, slipping from one leaf to the shelter of another, there was so little apparent link between it and the songs that I could barely believe they were produced by that restless little body, full of surprise and lack of expression."
"À cette heure-là on apercevait les trois hommes en smoking attendant la femme en retard, laquelle bientôt, en une robe presque chaque fois nouvelle et des écharpes choisies selon un goût particulier à son amant, après avoir, de son étage, sonné le lift, sortait de l’ascenseur comme d’une boîte de joujoux. Et tous les quatre qui trouvaient que le phénomène international du Palace, implanté à Balbec, y avait fait fleurir le luxe plus que la bonne cuisine, s’engouffraient dans une voiture, allaient dîner à une demi-lieue de là dans un petit restaurant réputé où ils avaient avec le cuisinier d’interminables conférences sur la composition du menu et la confection des plats. Pendant ce trajet la route bordée de pommiers qui part de Balbec n’était pour eux que la distance qu’il fallait franchir – peu distincte dans la nuit noire de celle qui séparait leurs domiciles parisiens du Café Anglais ou de la Tour d’Argent – avant d’arriver au petit restaurant élégant où, tandis que les amis du jeune homme riche l’enviaient d’avoir une maîtresse si bien habillée, les écharpes de celle-ci tendaient devant la petite société comme un voile parfumé et souple, mais qui la séparait du monde.","At that hour we could see the three men in tuxedos waiting for the late woman, who soon, in a dress almost every time new and scarves chosen according to a particular taste for her lover, after ringing the lift from her floor. , came out of the elevator like a box of toys. And all four who found that the international phenomenon of the Palace, established in Balbec, had made luxury flourish there more than good cuisine, rushed into a car, went to dinner half a league away in a small famous restaurant where they had endless conferences with the cook on the composition of the menu and the preparation of the dishes. During this journey, the road lined with apple trees from Balbec was for them only the distance that had to be crossed – not very distinct in the dark night from that which separated their Parisian homes from the Café Anglais or the Tour d'Argent – before arriving at the elegant little restaurant where, while the rich young man's friends envied him for having such a well-dressed mistress, her scarves stretched out before the small society like a perfumed and supple veil, but which separated her from the world.","At that hour one could see the three young men in dinner–jackets, waiting for the young woman, who was as usual late but presently, wearing a dress that was almost always different and one of a series of scarves, chosen to gratify some special instinct in her lover, after having from her landing rung for the lift, would emerge from it like a doll coming out of its box. And then all four, because they found that the international phenomenon of the 'Palace,' planted on Balbec soil, had blossomed there in material splendour rather than in food that was fit to eat, bundled into a carriage and went to dine, a mile off, in a little restaurant that was well spoken of, where they held with the cook himself endless discussions of the composition of their meal and the cooking of its various dishes. During their drive, the road bordered with apple–trees that led out of Balbec was no more to them than the distance that must be traversed—barely distinguishable in the darkness from that which separated their homes in Paris from the Café Anglais or the Tour d'Argent—before they could arrive at the fashionable little restaurant where, while the young man's friends envied him because he had such a smartly dressed mistress, the latter's scarves were spread about the little company like a fragrant, flowing veil, but one that kept it apart from the outer world.","At that hour, one could see the three men in dinner-suits waiting for the woman: she was late but, having rung the ‘lift’ from her floor, wearing a new dress almost every night, with a scarf or a stole dictated by a taste peculiar to her lover, she would soon step out of the lift as from a toybox. Then all four of them, who thought that the sprouting of this palatial international establishment at Balbec had fostered mere luxury rather than fine cuisine, clambered into a carriage and were driven off to dine a couple of miles away at a small but highly regarded restaurant, where they would have interminable consultations with the chef on the composition of the evening’s menu and the preparation of the different dishes. And as they drove, the road from Balbec, lined by apple-trees, was mere mileage – not very different in the dark from the distance separating their houses in Paris from the Café Anglais or the Tour d’Argent – which they had to cover in order to reach the smart little restaurant, where they would sit among friends who envied the wealthy young man his possession of such a well-dressed mistress, and where her scarves drew a sort of sleek perfumed veil over the little group, while secluding it from the rest of the world."
– Elle est tout à fait charmante !,"""She's absolutely charming!""","""She is altogether charming!""","‘Why, she is quite, quite charming!"
"Bergotte n’écartant pas mes objections, je lui avouai qu’elles avaient été méprisées par M. de Norpois. « Mais c’est un vieux serin, répondit-il ; il vous a donné des coups de bec parce qu’il croit toujours avoir devant lui un échaudé ou une seiche. – Comment ! vous connaissez Norpois, me dit Swann. – Oh ! il est ennuyeux comme la pluie, interrompit sa femme qui avait grande confiance dans le jugement de Bergotte et craignait sans doute que M. de Norpois ne nous eût dit du mal d’elle. J’ai voulu causer avec lui après le dîner, je ne sais pas si c’est l’âge ou la digestion, mais je l’ai trouvé d’un vaseux. Il semble qu’on aurait eu besoin de le doper ! – Oui, n’est-ce pas, dit Bergotte, il est bien obligé de se taire assez souvent pour ne pas épuiser avant la fin de la soirée la provision de sottises qui empèsent le jabot de la chemise et maintiennent le gilet blanc. – Je trouve Bergotte et ma femme bien sévères, dit Swann qui avait pris chez lui « l’emploi » d’homme de bon sens. Je reconnais que Norpois ne peut pas vous intéresser beaucoup, mais à un autre point de vue (car Swann aimait à recueillir les beautés de la « vie »), il est quelqu’un d’assez curieux, d’assez curieux comme « amant ». Quand il était secrétaire à Rome, ajouta-t-il, après s’être assuré que Gilberte ne pouvait pas entendre, il avait à Paris une maîtresse dont il était éperdu et il trouvait le moyen de faire le voyage deux fois par semaine pour la voir deux heures. C’était du reste une femme très intelligente et ravissante à ce moment-là, c’est une douairière maintenant. Et il en a eu beaucoup d’autres dans l’intervalle. Moi je serais devenu fou s’il avait fallu que la femme que j’aimais habitât Paris pendant que j’étais retenu à Rome. Pour les gens nerveux il faudrait toujours qu’ils aimassent, comme disent les gens du peuple, « au-dessous d’eux » afin qu’une question d’intérêt mît la femme qu’ils aiment à leur discrétion. » À ce moment Swann s’aperçut de l’application que je pouvais faire de cette maxime à lui et à Odette. Et comme même chez les êtres supérieurs, au moment où ils semblent planer avec vous au-dessus de la vie, l’amour-propre reste mesquin, il fut pris d’une mauvaise humeur contre moi. Mais cela ne se manifesta que par l’inquiétude de son regard. Il ne me dit rien au moment même. Il ne faut pas trop s’en étonner. Quand Racine, selon un récit d’ailleurs controuvé, mais dont la matière se répète tous les jours dans la vie de Paris, fit allusion à Scarron devant Louis XIV, le plus puissant roi du monde ne dit rien le soir même au poète. Et c’est le lendemain que celui-ci tomba en disgrâce.","Bergotte not dismissing my objections, I confessed to him that they had been scorned by M. de Norpois. “But he is an old canary,” he answered; he pecked you because he still thinks he has a scalded or a cuttlefish in front of him. - How ! you know Norpois, said Swann to me. - Oh ! he is tedious as the rain,” interrupted his wife, who had great confidence in Bergotte's judgment and doubtless feared that M. de Norpois had spoken ill of us of her. I wanted to talk to him after dinner, I don't know if it's age or digestion, but I found him sluggish. It looks like we needed to boost it! ""Yes, isn't it,"" said Bergotte, ""he is obliged to be silent often enough not to exhaust before the end of the evening the store of nonsense which weighs down the frill of the shirt and keeps the waistcoat white. ""I find Bergotte and my wife very severe,"" said Swann, who had taken the ""job"" of a man of common sense from him. I recognize that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view (because Swann liked to collect the beauties of ""life""), he is someone quite curious, quite curious as a ""lover "". When he was secretary in Rome, he added, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear, he had a mistress in Paris he was in love with, and he managed to make the trip twice a week for the see two hours. She was a very smart and lovely woman then, she's a dowager now. And there have been many more in the meantime. I would have gone mad if the woman I loved had had to live in Paris while I was detained in Rome. For nervous people they would always have to love, as the common people say, ""below them"" so that a question of interest puts the woman they love at their discretion. At this moment Swann perceived the application I could make of this maxim to him and to Odette. And as even in higher beings, at the moment when they seem to hover with you above life, self-love remains petty, he was seized with a bad temper against me. But that only showed in the worry in his eyes. He didn't say anything to me at the time. You shouldn't be too surprised. When Racine, according to a story that is moreover contrived, but the subject of which is repeated every day in the life of Paris, alluded to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful king in the world said nothing to the poet that very evening. And it was the next day that he fell into disgrace.","Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. "" But he's an old parrot!"" was the answer. "" He keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you're a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle–fish."" ""What's that?"" asked Swann. ""Are you a friend of Norpois?"" "" He's as dull as a wet Sunday,"" interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte's judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. ""I tried to make him talk after dinner; I don't know if it's his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to 'dope' him."" ""Yes, isn't he?"" Bergotte chimed in. ""You see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt–front down and his white waistcoat up."" ""I think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,"" came from Swann, who took the 'line,' in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. ""I quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,"" (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of 'real life') ""he is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,"" he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, ""he had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I'm sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, 'beneath' them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them. "" As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this maxim to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill–will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine (according to a story the truth of which has been exploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life) made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell.","As Bergotte had not dismissed my objections, I went on to tell him of the disdain with which M. de Norpois had treated them. ‘Look, he’s just an old parrot, Bergotte said; he took a peck at you because he always thinks whatever’s under his nose is bird-seed or a cuttle-bone. – What’s that? Swann asked me. You know Norpois? – Oh, isn’t he a dreadful old bore!’ Mme Swann said. She had great faith in Bergotte’s judgment and was probably anxious in case M. de Norpois had said something to her detriment. ‘I tried to have a conversation with him after dinner and, possibly because of his age, or perhaps poor digestion, I thought the man was quite, quite inane. One had the impression that he had been drugged to the eyeballs! – True, true, Bergotte said, he is obliged to observe frequent silences, so as to reach the end of the evening without using up the supply of starchy stupidities that keep his white waistcoat stiff. – I do think Bergotte and my dear wife are being rather hard on M. de Norpois,’ said Swann, whose job at home was to be the man of sound common sense. ‘I can appreciate that one may not think he’s all that interesting, but from another point of view’ (Swann being something of a ‘collector’ of life’s little curios) ‘he really is rather a noteworthy man. Noteworthy in his capacity as great lover, I mean.’ He added, with a glance to make sure that Gilberte could not hear him, ‘In the days when he was an attaché at the embassy in Rome, he had left behind in Paris a mistress whom he adored to distraction. So, twice a week, he would find a pretext to dash back and see her for a couple of hours. Mind you, she was a very clever and beautiful woman at that time. A dowager nowadays, of course. And he’s had plenty more since then. I must say that if it had been me, obliged to live in Rome while the woman I loved had to stay in Paris, it would have driven me mad. Highly strung people should always choose objects of their affections who are “beneath them”, as the saying goes, so that the self-interest of the woman one loves ensures that she will always be available.’ At that moment, Swann realized the connection I might make between this verity and his own love for Odette. This gave him a great fit of pique against me, for even the high-minded, at moments when one seems to be sharing in their higher things, are still capable of the pettiness of self-esteem. This grudge of Swann’s was apparent only in an uneasy look in his eye; and he said nothing about it at that moment. Not that there is anything very surprising in that – a story, which is apocryphal, but which is re-enacted every day of the week in Paris, has it that when Racine spoke the name of Scarron in the presence of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing about it to his poet at the time; and he did not fall from favour until the following day.53"
"Ce n’est pas assez dire que j’avais rejoint le calme et la santé, car c’était plus qu’une simple distance qui les avait la veille séparés de moi, j’avais eu toute la nuit à lutter contre un flot contraire, et puis je ne me retrouvais pas seulement auprès d’eux, ils étaient rentrés en moi. À des points précis et encore un peu douloureux de ma tête vide et qui serait un jour brisée, laissant mes idées s’échapper à jamais, celles-ci avaient une fois encore repris leur place, et retrouvé cette existence dont hélas ! jusqu’ici elles n’avaient pas su profiter.","It is not enough to say that I had rejoined calm and health, because it was more than a simple distance that had separated them from me the day before, I had had to fight all night against a contrary tide. , and then I didn't just find myself with them, they had entered into me. At precise and still somewhat painful points in my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape forever, these had once again taken their place, and rediscovered this existence of which alas! so far they had not been able to take advantage.","It is not enough to say that I had returned to tranquillity and health, for it was more than a mere interval of space that had divided them from me yesterday, I had had all night long to struggle against a contrary tide, and now I not only found myself again in their presence, they had once more entered into me. At certain definite and still somewhat painful points beneath the surface of my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape for all time, those ideas had once again taken their proper places and resumed that existence by which hitherto, alas, they had failed to profit.","I had done more than just return to mental repose and well-being: between them and me, the night before, there had been more than a slight distance, and I had had to struggle all night long against a torrent of foreignness; yet now here they were, not only back within my reach, but inside me. My ideas had taken up their former places in precise and as yet rather painful corners of my empty head, which would one day be split open, scattering them to the winds and ending an existence which they had so far put, alas, to little profit."
"Cette vaste vision céleste dont il me parlait, ce gigantesque poème théologique que je comprenais avoir été écrit là, pourtant quand mes yeux pleins de désirs s’étaient ouverts devant la façade, ce n’est pas eux que j’avais vus. Je lui parlais de ces grandes statues de saints qui montées sur des échasses forment une sorte d’avenue.","This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which I understood to have been written there, yet when my eyes full of desires had opened in front of the facade, it was not them that I had seen. I told him about those large statues of saints which, mounted on stilts, form a sort of avenue.","This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which, I understood, had been inscribed there in stone, yet when my eyes, big with desire, had opened to gaze upon the front of Balbec church, it was not these things that I had seen. I spoke to him of those great statues of saints, which, mounted on scaffolds, formed a sort of avenue on either side.","Though Elstir spoke of a grand vision of heaven and gave me an idea of a gigantic theological poem written on the face of the church, the eyes full of desires with which I had looked at it had seen nothing of them. I mentioned the large statues of saints on their stilts, forming a sort of avenue."
"Le long de la route, je ne me faisais plus d’ailleurs un écran de mes mains comme dans ces jours où concevant la nature comme animée d’une vie antérieure à l’apparition de l’homme, et en opposition avec tous ces fastidieux perfectionnements de l’industrie qui m’avaient fait jusqu’ici bâiller d’ennui dans les expositions universelles ou chez les modistes, j’essayais de ne voir de la mer que la section où il n’y avait pas de bateau à vapeur, de façon à me la représenter comme immémoriale, encore contemporaine des âges où elle avait été séparée de la terre, à tout le moins contemporaine des premiers siècles de la Grèce, ce qui me permettait de me redire en toute vérité les vers du « père Leconte » chers à Bloch :","Besides, along the road, I no longer screened myself with my hands as in those days when conceiving of nature as animated by a life prior to the appearance of man, and in opposition to all those tedious improvements in industry that had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at universal exhibitions or at millinery, I tried to see from the sea only the section where there was no steamboat, so as to represent it to me as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages when it had been separated from the earth, at the very least contemporary with the first centuries of Greece, which allowed me to repeat to myself in all truth the verses of ""Father Leconte dear to Bloch:","Nor, as I went along, did I still make a frame about my eyes with my hands as in the days when, conceiving nature to be animated by a life anterior to the first appearance of man, and inconsistent with all those wearisome perfections of industrial achievement which had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at Universal Exhibitions or in the milliners' windows, I endeavoured to include only that section of the sea over which there was no steamer passing, so that I might picture it to myself as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages in which it had been set apart from the land, or at least with the first dawn of life in Greece, which enabled me to repeat in their literal meaning the lines of 'Father Leconte' of which Bloch was so fond:","Nor could I continue, as we walked along, to blinker myself with my hands as I had done in the days when I conceived of nature as being animated by a life of its own, dating from before the time of human beings and out of keeping with all these futile refinements of industry which made me yawn with boredom at universal exhibitions or in dressmakers’ displays, so as to see only the stretch of sea with no steamer on it, so as to go on imagining it as immemorial and still belonging, if not to that earliest era when it had been divided from the dry land, at least to the first centuries of ancient Greece, which enabled me to go on reciting to myself in all good faith the lines of ‘old Leconte’ that Bloch was so fond of:"
"Dans l’entrebâillement d’une tenture une tête se montrait cérémonieusement déférente, feignant par plaisanterie la peur de déranger : c’était Swann. « Odette, le prince d’Agrigente qui est avec moi dans mon cabinet demande s’il pourrait venir vous présenter ses hommages. Que dois-je aller lui répondre ? – Mais que je serai enchantée », disait Odette avec satisfaction sans se départir d’un calme qui lui était d’autant plus facile qu’elle avait toujours, même comme cocotte, reçu des hommes élégants. Swann partait transmettre l’autorisation et, accompagné du prince, il revenait auprès de sa femme à moins que dans l’intervalle ne fût entrée Mme Verdurin. Quand il avait épousé Odette, il lui avait demandé de ne plus fréquenter le petit clan (il avait pour cela bien des raisons et, s’il n’en avait pas eu, l’eût fait tout de même par obéissance à une loi d’ingratitude qui ne souffre pas d’exception et qui faisait ressortir l’imprévoyance de tous les entremetteurs ou leur désintéressement). Il avait seulement permis qu’Odette échangeât avec Mme Verdurin deux visites par an, ce qui semblait encore excessif à certains fidèles indignés de l’injure faite à la Patronne qui avait pendant tant d’années traité Odette et même Swann comme les enfants chéris de la maison. Car s’il contenait des faux frères qui lâchaient certains soirs pour se rendre sans le dire à une invitation d’Odette, prêts, dans le cas où ils seraient découverts, à s’excuser sur la curiosité de rencontrer Bergotte (quoique la Patronne prétendît qu’il ne fréquentait pas chez les Swann, était dépourvu de talent, et malgré cela elle cherchait, suivant une expression qui lui était chère, à l’attirer), le petit groupe avait aussi ses « ultras ». Et ceux-ci, ignorants des convenances particulières qui détournent souvent les gens de l’attitude extrême qu’on aimerait à leur voir prendre pour ennuyer quelqu’un, auraient souhaité et n’avaient pas obtenu que Mme Verdurin cessât toutes relations avec Odette, et lui ôtât ainsi la satisfaction de dire en riant : « Nous allons très rarement chez la Patronne depuis le Schisme. C’était encore possible quand mon mari était garçon, mais pour un ménage ce n’est pas toujours très facile… M. Swann, pour vous dire la vérité, n’avale pas la mère Verdurin et il n’apprécierait pas beaucoup que j’en fasse ma fréquentation habituelle. Et moi, fidèle épouse… » Swann y accompagnait sa femme en soirée, mais évitait d’être là quand Mme Verdurin venait chez Odette en visite. Aussi si la Patronne était dans le salon, le prince d’Agrigente entrait seul. Seul aussi d’ailleurs il était présenté par Odette, qui préférait que Mme Verdurin n’entendît pas de noms obscurs et, voyant plus d’un visage inconnu d’elle, pût se croire au milieu de notabilités aristocratiques, calcul qui réussissait si bien que le soir Mme Verdurin disait avec dégoût à son mari : « Charmant milieu ! Il y avait toute la fleur de la Réaction ! » Odette vivait à l’égard de Mme Verdurin dans une illusion inverse. Non que ce salon eût même seulement commencé alors de devenir ce que nous le verrons être un jour. Mme Verdurin n’en était même pas encore à la période d’incubation où on suspend les grandes fêtes dans lesquelles les rares éléments brillants récemment acquis seraient noyés dans trop de tourbe et où on préfère attendre que le pouvoir générateur des dix justes qu’on a réussi à attirer en ait produit septante fois dix. Comme Odette n’allait pas tarder à le faire, Mme Verdurin se proposait bien le « monde » comme objectif, mais ses zones d’attaque étaient encore si limitées et d’ailleurs si éloignées de celles par où Odette avait quelque chance d’arriver à un résultat identique, à percer, que celle-ci vivait dans la plus complète ignorance des plans stratégiques qu’élaborait la Patronne. Et c’était de la meilleure foi du monde que, quand on parlait à Odette de Mme Verdurin comme d’une snob, Odette se mettait à rire et disait : « C’est tout le contraire. D’abord elle n’en a pas les éléments, elle ne connaît personne. Ensuite il faut lui rendre cette justice que cela lui plaît ainsi. Non, ce qu’elle aime ce sont ses mercredis, les causeurs agréables. » Et secrètement elle enviait à Mme Verdurin (bien qu’elle ne désespérât pas d’avoir elle-même à une si grande école fini par les apprendre) ces arts auxquels la Patronne attachait une si belle importance bien qu’ils ne fassent que nuancer l’inexistant, sculpter le vide, et soient à proprement parler les Arts du Néant : l’art (pour une maîtresse de maison) de savoir « réunir », de s’entendre à « grouper », de « mettre en valeur », de « s’effacer », de servir de « trait d’union ».","In the crack of a hanging a head showed itself ceremoniously deferential, jokingly feigning fear of disturbing: it was Swann. “Odette, the Prince of Agrigento, who is with me in my cabinet, asks if he could come and pay his respects to you. What should I say to him? ""But how enchanted I will be,"" said Odette with satisfaction, without departing from a calmness which was all the easier for her in that she had always, even as a cocotte, received elegant men. Swann left to transmit the authorization and, accompanied by the prince, he returned to his wife, unless Madame Verdurin had entered in the meantime. When he had married Odette, he had asked her not to frequent the little clan any longer (he had many reasons for that and, if he hadn't had any, he would have done it all the same out of obedience to a law of ingratitude which suffers no exception and which brought out the lack of foresight of all the go-betweens or their disinterestedness). He had only allowed Odette to exchange with Mme Verdurin two visits a year, which still seemed excessive to certain faithful indignant at the insult done to the Patroness who had for so many years treated Odette and even Swann as the darlings of the House. Because if it contained false brothers who dropped out on certain evenings to surrender without saying so at an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event that they were discovered, to apologize for the curiosity of meeting Bergotte (although the Patroness claimed whom he did not frequent at the Swanns, was devoid of talent, and in spite of that she sought, according to an expression which was dear to her, to attract him), the little group also had its ""ultras."" And these, unaware of the particular proprieties which often divert people from the extreme attitude one would like to see them take in order to annoy someone, would have liked and had not obtained that Mme Verdurin should cease all relations with Odette, and thus deprived him of the satisfaction of saying with a laugh: ""We very rarely go to the Patroness since the Schism."" It was still possible when my husband was a boy, but for a household it's not always very easy... Mr. Swann, to tell you the truth, doesn't swallow Mother Verdurin and he wouldn't appreciate it very much if I make it my usual frequentation. And I, faithful wife…” Swann accompanied his wife there in the evening, but avoided being there when Madame Verdurin came to visit Odette. Also if the Patroness was in the salon, the Prince of Agrigento entered alone. Besides, he was the only one introduced by Odette, who preferred that Madame Verdurin not hear obscure names and, seeing more than one face unknown to her, could believe herself in the midst of aristocratic notabilities, a calculation that succeeded so well. that in the evening Madame Verdurin said with disgust to her husband: ""Charming surroundings!"" There was the whole flower of the Reaction! Odette lived with respect to Madame Verdurin in an opposite illusion. Not that this salon had even then begun to become what we will see it one day. Madame Verdurin had not even reached the incubation period yet, when the great celebrations were suspended, in which the rare, recently acquired shiny elements would be drowned in too much peat and when one preferred to wait for the generative power of the ten just ones succeeded in attracting produced seventy times ten. As Odette was not long in doing, Madame Verdurin did indeed propose the ""world"" as her objective, but her zones of attack were still so limited and moreover so far from those by which Odette had any chance of arriving. to an identical result, to be seen, that she lived in the most complete ignorance of the strategic plans that the Patroness was drawing up. And it was in the best faith in the world that, when Odette was referred to as a snob by Madame Verdurin, Odette would laugh and say: ""It's quite the opposite."" First of all, she doesn't have the elements, she doesn't know anyone. Then you have to do him the justice that he likes it that way. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, the pleasant talkers. And secretly she envied Madame Verdurin (although she did not despair of having herself at such a great school ended up learning them) these arts to which the Patroness attached such great importance, although they only nuanced the non-existent, sculpt the void, and are strictly speaking the Arts of Nothingness: the art (for a hostess) of knowing how to ""unite"", of knowing how to ""group"", of ""enhancing"", to ""disappear"", to serve as a ""hyphen"".","Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. "" Odette, the Prince d'Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?"" ""Why, that I shall be delighted,"" Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her 'fast' days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. (He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception, and proves that every 'go–between' is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year, and even this seemed excessive to some of the 'faithful,' indignant at the insult offered to the 'Mistress' who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who 'failed' upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the excuse that they were anxious to meet Bergotte (although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns', and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really—in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite expressions, to 'attract' him), the little group had its 'die–hards' also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: ""We go to the Mistress's very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn't always so easy…. If you must know, M. Swann can't abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn't much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don't you see…? "" Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the 'Mistress' was in the drawing–room, the Prince d'Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: ""Charming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!"" Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a converse illusion. Not that the latter's salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shall one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one's big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of 'Society' as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the 'Mistress' was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, ""Oh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn't know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well."" And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin (for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them) those arts to which the 'Mistress' attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non–existent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to 'bring people together,' how to 'group,' to 'draw out,' to 'keep in the background,' to act as a 'connecting link.'","A face might then appear round the edge of the door-curtain, its features set in a mime of polite and playful reluctance to interrupt: it was Swann: ‘Odette, I’ve got the Prince d’Agrigente with me in my study and he wishes to know whether he may come and pay his respects. What am I to say? – Tell him I’ll be delighted, of course!’ Odette would say, full of gratification, and quite unperturbed by the prospect of being visited by such a fashionable gentleman, something she had always been accustomed to, even as a courtesan. Swann went off to deliver the message; and he would soon come back with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme Verdurin had made her entry. On marrying Odette, Swann had asked her to resign from ‘the little set’. For this he had many reasons; but even if he had had none, he would still have done so, by reason of a law of ingratitude which, quite without exception, demonstrates the improvidence of all go-betweens, or perhaps their disinterest. He had permitted Odette to exchange only two visits a year with Mme Verdurin, a number which seemed excessive to certain of the ‘regulars’ who were offended at the insult done to ‘the Patronne’, given that for so many years she had treated Odette and even Swann himself as her special favourites. Although the membership of the little clan included certain faithless souls who were capable of ‘welshing’ on certain evenings, so as to slip off and surreptitiously attend some function of Odette’s, and who if they were found out gave as an excuse their eagerness to meet Bergotte (the Patronne’s view being that he never went to the Swanns’, and was devoid of talent anyway, despite which she made constant attempts to, as she liked to put it, ‘bring him in’), it did also contain its extremists. They, in their disregard for the particular proprieties which can often dissuade others from whatever extreme course one may be urging upon them in one’s desire to do a disservice to someone else, had pressed Mme Verdurin, but to no avail, to sever all contact with Odette, and thus deprive her of the pleasure of saying with a laugh: ‘We don’t see much of the Patronne now, you know, not since the Schism. While my husband was still a bachelor, of course, there was no difficulty. But for a married couple, it’s not always easy … To be quite honest, M. Swann is not over-fond of old Mother Verdurin and he would not take kindly to my being among her boon companions. And I’m a very dutiful wife, you know.’ Swann would accompany Odette to a soirée of Mme Verdurin’s; but he made a point of not being at home for the latter’s return visit. So it was that if Mme Verdurin was present in the drawing-room, the Prince d’Agrigente was sure to come in alone. He was also the only man whom Odette ever introduced to Mme Verdurin; for her idea was that if ‘the Patronne’ was surrounded by faces unfamiliar to her, and if she heard the names of no obscurities being uttered, she might believe these people were all aristocrats of note, an idea which worked so well that Mme Verdurin would sneer that evening to her husband, ‘Charming people! She’s got all the reactionary bigwigs!’ As for Odette’s illusion about Mme Verdurin, it was the opposite one. Not that the latter’s salon at that time had even begun to aspire to the status which it will later be seen to have. Mme Verdurin had not even reached the stage of incubation, when one postpones one’s most lavish galas lest one’s few recently acquired celebrities should be swamped by the hoi polloi, and when one prefers to await the moment when the generative power of the ten good men and true whom one has managed to ‘bring in’ shall bring forth an hundredfold. As Odette’s was soon to be, Mme Verdurin ’s aim was ‘Society’; but the zones in which she launched her offensives were still so restricted, as well as being remote from those in which Odette might hope to emulate her and begin to make a name for herself, that Odette lived in a state of utter ignorance of the strategic plans drawn up by the Patronne. So when anyone spoke of Mme Verdurin as a snob, it was with the simplest sincerity that Odette would laugh and say, ‘No, no, she’s the exact opposite! I mean, she just hasn’t got the basic requirement – she doesn’t know anybody! And to be fair, you must admit that’s how she likes to be. You see, what she really likes is those little Wednesday gatherings of hers, with those inoffensive people who drop in for a chat.’ However, Odette did nurse a surreptitious envy of Mme Verdurin’s mastery of those arts (though she rather prided herself too on having picked up the rudiments of them from such an Oracle) to which the Patronne attached so much importance, though all they ever do is refine the nicer quibbles of non-existence, give vacancy its shape, being in the strictest sense those Arts of Naught practised by hostesses: the ability to ‘bring people together’, to ‘bring people out’, to ‘match guests with one another’, to ‘be present but invisible’, to be ‘a good go-between’."
"Un jour, à l’heure du courrier, ma mère posa sur mon lit une lettre. Je l’ouvris distraitement puisqu’elle ne pouvait pas porter la seule signature qui m’eût rendu heureux, celle de Gilberte avec qui je n’avais pas de relations en dehors des Champs-Élysées. Or, au bas du papier, timbré d’un sceau d’argent représentant un chevalier casqué sous lequel se contournait cette devise : Per viam rectam, au-dessous d’une lettre, d’une grande écriture, et où presque toutes les phrases semblaient soulignées, simplement parce que la barre des t étant tracée non au travers d’eux, mais au-dessus, mettait un trait sous le mot correspondant de la ligne supérieure, ce fut justement la signature de Gilberte que je vis. Mais parce que je la savais impossible dans une lettre adressée à moi, cette vue, non accompagnée de croyance, ne me causa pas de joie. Pendant un instant elle ne fit que frapper d’irréalité tout ce qui m’entourait. Avec une vitesse vertigineuse, cette signature sans vraisemblance jouait aux quatre coins avec mon lit, ma cheminée, mon mur. Je voyais tout vaciller comme quelqu’un qui tombe de cheval et je me demandais s’il n’y avait pas une existence toute différente de celle que je connaissais, en contradiction avec elle, mais qui serait la vraie, et qui m’étant montrée tout d’un coup me remplissait de cette hésitation que les sculpteurs dépeignant le Jugement dernier ont donnée aux morts réveillés qui se trouvent au seuil de l’autre Monde. « Mon cher ami, disait la lettre, j’ai appris que vous aviez été très souffrant et que vous ne veniez plus aux Champs-Élysées. Moi je n’y vais guère non plus parce qu’il y a énormément de malades. Mais mes amies viennent goûter tous les lundis et vendredis à la maison. Maman me charge de vous dire que vous nous feriez très grand plaisir en venant aussi dès que vous serez rétabli, et nous pourrions reprendre à la maison nos bonnes causeries des Champs-Élysées. Adieu, mon cher ami, j’espère que vos parents vous permettront de venir très souvent goûter, et je vous envoie toutes mes amitiés. Gilberte. »","One day, at mail time, my mother put a letter on my bed. I opened it distractedly since it could not bear the only signature that would have made me happy, that of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Élysées. Now, at the bottom of the paper, stamped with a silver seal representing a helmeted knight under which this motto was outlined: Per viam rectam, below a letter, in large writing, and where almost all the sentences seemed underlined, simply because the bar of the t's being traced not through them, but above, put a line under the corresponding word of the upper line, it was precisely Gilberte's signature that I saw. But because I knew it impossible in a letter addressed to me, this sight, unaccompanied by belief, caused me no joy. For a moment it only made everything around me seem unreal. With dizzying speed, this implausible signature was playing around with my bed, my fireplace, my wall. I saw everything waver like someone falling off a horse and I wondered if there wasn't an existence quite different from the one I knew, in contradiction with it, but which would be the real one, and which being to me suddenly shown filled me with that hesitation that the sculptors depicting the Last Judgment gave to the awakened dead who find themselves on the threshold of the other World. “My dear friend, said the letter, I learned that you had been very unwell and that you were no longer coming to the Champs-Élysées. I hardly go there either because there are so many sick people. But my friends come to taste every Monday and Friday at home. Mama asks me to tell you that you would give us great pleasure by coming as soon as you are well again, and we could resume our good chats on the Champs-Élysées at home. Adieu, my dear friend, I hope that your parents will allow you to come very often to tea, and I send you all my best regards. Gilberte. »","One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs–Elysées. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man's head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the 't's ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte's signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true existence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world. "" My dear Friend,"" said the letter, ""I hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs–Elysées. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I'm having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs–Elysées. Good–bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.""","One day, when the postman had just been, my mother laid a letter on my bed. I opened it, my mind elsewhere, as it could not possibly contain the only signature which would have made me happy, that of Gilberte Swann, because I never had any contact with her away from the Champs-Élysées. Yet, there at the bottom of the page, which was stamped with a silver seal in the form of a helmeted knight surmounting a scrolled motto Per viam rectam, at the end of a letter in an expansive hand, which seemed to have underlined nearly all the sentences, because the cross-bar of every t was dashed above the letter and not through it, thus scratching a line under the corresponding word in the line above, the signature I read was Gilberte’s! However, because I knew this signature to be impossible in a letter addressed to me, the sight of it, unaccompanied as it was by any belief in it, brought me no happiness. For a moment, all it did was cast an unreal light on everything around me. At dizzying speed, the improbable signature jumbled the things in my room, the bed, the fireplace, the walls. Everything I looked at was wobbling, as though I had had a fall from a horse; and I wondered whether there might not be some other mode of existence quite different from the one known to me, at variance with it but more real than it, which in the glimpse I had just caught of it had filled me with the hesitancy which sculptors depicting the Last Judgment show on the faces of the awakened dead, who stand already on the threshold of the Other World. The letter said: ‘Dear Friend, I hear you have been very ill and are not going to the Champs -Élysées now. I’ve almost stopped going there too, because of everybody falling ill. But my girl-friends come to tea with me every Monday and Friday. My mother wants you to know we should be very pleased if you could come too, as soon as you are well again. We could have nice chats at home the way we used to at the Champs-Élysées! So, in the hope that your parents will allow you to come to afternoon tea very soon, I say good-bye and send you all my best wishes. Gilberte.’"
"Toutes ces diatribes confidentielles de Bloch à Saint-Loup contre moi, à moi contre Saint-Loup finirent par une invitation à dîner. Je ne suis pas bien sûr qu’il ne fit pas d’abord une tentative pour avoir Saint-Loup seul. La vraisemblance rend cette tentative probable, le succès ne la couronna pas, car ce fut à moi et à Saint-Loup que Bloch dit un jour : « Cher maître, et vous, cavalier aimé d’Arès, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, dompteur de chevaux, puisque je vous ai rencontrés sur le rivage d’Amphitrite résonnant d’écume, près des tentes des Ménier aux nefs rapides, voulez-vous tous deux venir dîner un jour de la semaine chez mon illustre père au cœur irréprochable ? » Il nous adressait cette invitation parce qu’il avait le désir de se lier plus étroitement avec Saint-Loup qui le ferait, espérait-il, pénétrer dans les milieux aristocratiques. Formé par moi, pour moi, ce souhait eût paru à Bloch la marque du plus hideux snobisme, bien conforme à l’opinion qu’il avait de tout un côté de ma nature qu’il ne jugeait pas, jusqu’ici du moins, le principal ; mais le même souhait, de sa part, lui semblait la preuve d’une belle curiosité de son intelligence désireuse de certains dépaysements sociaux où il pouvait peut-être trouver quelque utilité littéraire. M. Bloch père, quand son fils lui avait dit qu’il amènerait à dîner un de ses amis, dont il avait décliné sur un ton de satisfaction sarcastique le titre et le nom : « Le marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray » avait éprouvé une commotion violente. « Le marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray ! Ah ! bougre ! » s’était-il écrié, usant du juron qui était chez lui la marque la plus forte de la déférence sociale. Et il avait jeté sur son fils, capable de s’être fait de telles relations, un regard admiratif qui signifiait : « Il est vraiment étonnant. Ce prodige est-il mon enfant ? » et qui causa autant de plaisir à mon camarade que si cinquante francs avaient été ajoutés à sa pension mensuelle. Car Bloch était mal à l’aise chez lui et sentait que son père le traitait de dévoyé parce qu’il vivait dans l’admiration de Leconte de Lisle, Heredia et autres « bohèmes ». Mais des relations avec Saint-Loup-en-Bray dont le père avait été président du Canal de Suez ! (ah ! bougre !) c’était un résultat « indiscutable ». On regretta d’autant plus d’avoir laissé à Paris, par crainte de l’abîmer, le stéréoscope. Seul, M. Bloch, le père, avait l’art ou du moins le droit de s’en servir. Il ne le faisait du reste que rarement, à bon escient, les jours où il y avait gala et domestiques mâles en extra. De sorte que de ces séances de stéréoscope émanaient pour ceux qui y assistaient comme une distinction, une faveur de privilégiés, et pour le maître de maison qui les donnait un prestige analogue à celui que le talent confère et qui n’aurait pas pu être plus grand, si les vues avaient été prises par M. Bloch lui-même et l’appareil de son invention. « Vous n’étiez pas invité hier chez Salomon ? » disait-on dans la famille. – Non, je n’étais pas des élus ! – Qu’est-ce qu’il y avait ? – Un grand tralala, le stéréoscope, toute la boutique. – Ah ! s’il y avait le stéréoscope, je regrette, car il paraît que Salomon est extraordinaire quand il le montre. – Que veux-tu, dit M. Bloch à son fils, il ne faut pas lui donner tout à la fois, comme cela il lui restera quelque chose à désirer. » Il avait bien pensé dans sa tendresse paternelle et pour émouvoir son fils à faire venir l’instrument. Mais le « temps matériel » manquait, ou plutôt on avait cru qu’il manquerait ; mais nous dûmes faire le dîner parce que Saint-Loup ne put se déplacer, attendant un oncle qui allait venir passer quarante-huit heures auprès de Mme de Villeparisis. Comme, très adonné aux exercices physiques, surtout aux longues marches, c’était en grande partie à pied, en couchant la nuit dans les fermes, que cet oncle devait faire la route depuis le château où il était en villégiature, le moment où il arriverait à Balbec était assez incertain. Et Saint-Loup n’osant bouger me chargea même d’aller porter à Incauville, où était le bureau télégraphique, la dépêche que mon ami envoyait quotidiennement à sa maîtresse. L’oncle qu’on attendait s’appelait Palamède, d’un prénom qu’il avait hérité des princes de Sicile ses ancêtres. Et plus tard quand je retrouvai dans mes lectures historiques, appartenant à tel podestat ou tel prince de l’Église, ce prénom même, belle médaille de la Renaissance – d’aucuns disaient un véritable antique – toujours restée dans la famille, ayant glissé de descendant en descendant depuis le cabinet du Vatican jusqu’à l’oncle de mon ami, j’éprouvais le plaisir réservé à ceux qui ne pouvant faute d’argent constituer un médaillier, une pinacothèque, recherchent les vieux noms (noms de localités, documentaires et pittoresques comme une carte ancienne, une vue cavalière, une enseigne ou un coutumier, noms de baptême où résonne et s’entend, dans les belles finales françaises, le défaut de langue, l’intonation d’une vulgarité ethnique, la prononciation vicieuse selon lesquels nos ancêtres faisaient subir aux mots latins et saxons des mutilations durables devenues plus tard les augustes législatrices des grammaires) et en somme, grâce à ces collections de sonorités anciennes, se donnent à eux-mêmes des concerts à la façon de ceux qui acquièrent des violes de gambe et des violes d’amour pour jouer de la musique d’autrefois sur des instruments anciens. Saint-Loup me dit que même dans la société aristocratique la plus fermée son oncle Palamède se distinguait encore comme particulièrement difficile d’accès, dédaigneux, entiché de sa noblesse, formant avec la femme de son frère et quelques autres personnes choisies ce qu’on appelait le cercle des Phénix. Là même il était si redouté pour ses insolences qu’autrefois il était arrivé que des gens du monde qui désiraient le connaître et s’étaient adressés à son propre frère avaient essuyé un refus. « Non, ne me demandez pas de vous présenter à mon frère Palamède. Ma femme, nous tous, nous nous y attellerions que nous ne pourrions pas. Ou bien vous risqueriez qu’il ne soit pas aimable et je ne le voudrais pas. » Au Jockey, il avait avec quelques amis désigné deux cents membres qu’ils ne se laisseraient jamais présenter. Et chez le comte de Paris il était connu sous le sobriquet du « Prince » à cause de son élégance et de sa fierté.","All these confidential diatribes of Bloch to Saint-Loup against me, to me against Saint-Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am not quite sure that he did not first make an attempt to have Saint-Loup alone. Probability makes this attempt probable, success did not crown it, for it was to me and to Saint-Loup that Bloch said one day: ""Dear master, and you, horseman beloved of Arès, of Saint-Loup-en- Bray, tamer of horses, since I met you on the shore of Amphitrite resounding with foam, near the tents of the fast-moving Meniers, will you both come and dine on a weekday with my illustrious father with an irreproachable heart? ? He addressed this invitation to us because he wanted to bind himself more closely with Saint-Loup which would, he hoped, introduce him into aristocratic circles. Formed by me, for me, this wish would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbery, quite in conformity with the opinion he had of a whole side of my nature which he did not judge, until now at least, the main ; but the same wish, on his part, seemed to him the proof of a beautiful curiosity of his intelligence desirous of certain social disorientations where he could perhaps find some literary utility. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he would bring one of his friends to dinner, whose title and name he had stated in a tone of sarcastic satisfaction: ""The Marquis of Saint-Loup-en-Bray"" suffered a violent concussion. “The Marquis of Saint-Loup-en-Bray! Ah! bugger! he exclaimed, using the oath that was his strongest mark of social deference. And he had thrown on his son, capable of having made such relations, an admiring look which meant: “He is really astonishing. Is this prodigy my child? and which gave my comrade as much pleasure as if fifty francs had been added to his monthly pension. Because Bloch was uncomfortable at home and felt that his father called him a rogue because he lived in admiration of Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other ""bohemians"". But relations with Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been president of the Suez Canal! (ah! bugger!) it was an “indisputable” result. They regretted all the more that they had left the stereoscope in Paris, for fear of damaging it. Only M. Bloch, the father, had the art or at least the right to use it. Besides, he rarely did it, wisely, on days when there were galas and extra male servants. So that these stereoscopic sessions emanated for those who attended them as a distinction, a favor of the privileged, and for the master of the house who gave them a prestige analogous to that which talent confers and who could not have been more great, if the views had been taken by M. Bloch himself and the apparatus of his invention. ""You weren't invited to Solomon's yesterday?"" they said in the family. - No, I was not chosen! - What was there ? – A big hoopla, the stereoscope, the whole shop. – Ah! if there was the stereoscope, I'm sorry, because it seems that Solomon is extraordinary when he shows it. ""What do you want,"" said M. Bloch to his son, ""we mustn't give him everything at once, that way he will have something left to desire."" He had thought well in his paternal tenderness and to move his son to bring the instrument. But “material time” was lacking, or rather it was believed that it would be lacking; but we had to make dinner because Saint-Loup could not move, waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend forty-eight hours with Madame de Villeparisis. As, very addicted to physical exercise, especially to long walks, it was largely on foot, sleeping at night in the farms, that this uncle had to make the journey from the castle where he was vacationing, when he would arrive at Balbec was quite uncertain. And Saint-Loup, not daring to move, even instructed me to take to Incauville, where the telegraph office was, the despatch which my friend sent daily to his mistress. The expected uncle was called Palamède, a first name he had inherited from the princes of Sicily, his ancestors. And later when I found in my historical readings, belonging to such a podesta or such a prince of the Church, this very first name, a beautiful Renaissance medallion – some said a real antique – which had always remained in the family, having slipped from descending from the cabinet of the Vatican to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure reserved for those who, unable for lack of money to set up a coin collection, an art gallery, are looking for old names (names of localities, documentaries and picturesque like an old map, a bird's-eye view, a sign or a customary, baptismal names where resonates and is heard, in the beautiful French finales, the language defect, the intonation of an ethnic vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation according to which our ancestors subjected Latin and Saxon words to lasting mutilations which later became the august legislators of grammars) and in short, thanks to these collections of ancient sounds, give themselves to them -even concerts like those who acquire violas da gamba and violas d'amore to play music from the past on old instruments. Saint-Loup tells me that even in the most closed aristocratic society his uncle Palamède still distinguished himself as particularly difficult to approach, disdainful, infatuated with his nobility, forming with his brother's wife and a few other chosen people what one called the Circle of Phoenixes. Even there he was so feared for his insolence that formerly it had happened that people in the world who wanted to know him and had addressed themselves to his own brother had met with a refusal. “No, don't ask me to introduce you to my brother Palamedes. My wife, all of us, we would tackle it that we couldn't. Or else you risk him being unlovable and I wouldn't want that. At the Jockey, he and some friends had designated two hundred members whom they would never allow themselves to be introduced. And at the Count of Paris he was known by the nickname of the ""Prince"" because of his elegance and his pride.","All these confidential diatribes by Bloch to Saint–Loup against me and to me against Saint– Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am by no means sure that he did not first make an attempt to secure Saint– Loup by himself. It would have been so like Bloch to do so that probably he did; but if so success did not crown his effort, for it was to myself and Saint –Loup that Bloch said one day: "" Dear master, and you, O horseman beloved of Ares, de Saint– Loup–en– Bray, tamer of horses, since I have encountered you by the shore of Amphitrite, resounding with foam, hard by the tents of the swift–shipped Méniers, will both of you come to dinner any day this week with my illustrious sire, of blameless heart?"" He proffered this invitation because he desired to attach himself more closely to Saint–Loup who would, he hoped, secure him the right of entry into aristocratic circles. Formed by me for myself, this ambition would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbishness, quite in keeping with the opinion that he already held of a whole side of my nature which he did not regard—or at least had not hitherto regarded—as its most important side; but the same ambition in himself seemed to him the proof of a finely developed curiosity in a mind anxious to carry out certain social explorations from which he might perhaps glean some literary benefit. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he was going to bring one of his friends in to dinner, and had in a sarcastic but satisfied tone enunciated the name and title of that friend: ""The Marquis de Saint–Loup–en–Bray,"" had been thrown into great commotion. "" The Marquis de Saint–Loup–en– Bray! I'll be jiggered!"" he had exclaimed, using the oath which was with him the strongest indication of social deference. And he cast at a son capable of having formed such an acquaintance an admiring glance which seemed to say: ""Really, it is astounding. Can this prodigy be indeed a child of mine?"" which gave my friend as much pleasure as if his monthly allowance had been increased by fifty francs. For Bloch was not in his element at home and felt that his father treated him like a lost sheep because of his lifelong admiration for Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other 'Bohemians.' But to have got to know Saint–Loup– en– Bray, whose father had been chairman of the Suez Canal board ('I'll be jiggered!') was an indisputable 'score.' What a pity, indeed, that they had left in Paris, for fear of its being broken on the journey, the stereoscope. Alone among men, M. Bloch senior had the art, or at least the right to exhibit it. He did this, moreover, on rare occasions only, and then to good purpose, on evenings when there was a full–dress affair, with hired waiters. So that from these exhibitions of the stereoscope there emanated, for those who were present, as it were a special distinction, a privileged position, and for the master of the house who gave them a reputation such as talent confers on a man—which could not have been greater had the photographs been taken by M. Bloch himself and the machine his own invention. ""You weren't invited to Solomon's yesterday?"" one of the family would ask another. "" No! I was not one of the elect. What was on?"" ""Oh, a great how–d'ye–do, the stereoscope, the whole box of tricks!"" ""Indeed! If they had the stereoscope I'm sorry I wasn't there; they say Solomon is quite amazing when he works it. ""—""It can't be helped;"" said M. Bloch now to his son, ""it's a mistake to let him have everything at once; that would leave him nothing to look forward to."" He had actually thought, in his paternal affection and in the hope of touching his son's heart, of sending for the instrument. But there was not time, or rather they had thought there would not be; for we were obliged to put off the dinner because Saint–Loup could not leave the hotel, where he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend a few days with Mme. de Villeparisis. Since—for he was greatly addicted to physical culture, and especially to long walks—it was largely on foot, spending the night in wayside farms, that this uncle was to make the journey from the country house in which he was staying, the precise date of his arrival at Balbec was by no means certain. And Saint–Loup, afraid to stir out of doors, even entrusted me with the duty of taking to Incauville, where the nearest telegraph–office was, the messages that he sent every day to his mistress. The uncle for whom we were waiting was called Palamède, a name that had come down to him from his ancestors, the Princes of Sicily. And later on when I found, as I read history, belonging to this or that Podestà or Prince of the Church, the same Christian name, a fine renaissance medal—some said, a genuine antique—that had always remained in the family, having passed from generation to generation, from the Vatican cabinet to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure that is reserved for those who, unable from lack of means to start a case of medals, or a picture gallery, look out for old names (names of localities, instructive and picturesque as an old map, a bird's–eye view, a sign–board or a return of customs; baptismal names, in which rings out and is plainly heard, in their fine French endings, the defect of speech, the intonation of a racial vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation by which our ancestors made Latin and Saxon words undergo lasting mutilations which in due course became the august law–givers of our grammar books) and, in short, by drawing upon their collections of ancient and sonorous words, give themselves concerts like the people who acquire viols da gamba and viols d'amour so as to perform the music of days gone by upon old–fashioned instruments. Saint–Loup told me that even in the most exclusive aristocratic society his uncle Palamède had the further distinction of being particularly difficult to approach, contemptuous, double–dyed in his nobility, forming with his brother's wife and a few other chosen spirits what was known as the Phoenix Club. There even his insolence was so much dreaded that it had happened more than once that people of good position who had been anxious to meet him and had applied to his own brother for an introduction had met with a refusal: ""Really, you mustn't ask me to introduce you to my brother Palamède. My wife and I, we would all of us do our best for you, but it would be no good. Besides, there's always the danger of his being rude to you, and I shouldn't like that."" At the Jockey Club he had, with a few of his friends, marked a list of two hundred members whom they would never allow to be introduced to them. And in the Comte de Paris's circle he was known by the nickname of 'The Prince' because of his distinction and his pride.","The outcome of all these confidential diatribes of Bloch’s to Saint-Loup against me, and to me against Saint-Loup, was an invitation to dinner. I think he may even have made a preliminary attempt to invite only Saint-Loup. Everything I know about him makes for the plausibility of this hypothesis; but it was unsuccessful, and it was in the presence of both Saint-Loup and myself that Bloch said one day, ‘Good my lord, and you, knight favoured of Ares, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, subduer of steeds, since I have met you on this surf-resounding strand of Amphitrite, close by the tents of Menier of the swift ships,49 would you both please come to dinner one evening during the week, at the table of my illustrious father of irreproachable heart?’ Bloch issued this invitation because of his desire for closer relations with Saint-Loup, who he hoped would give him access to aristocratic circles. If I had been the one to have such a desire, with such an intent, Bloch would have seen it as a mark of the most detestable snobbery, in keeping with the view he had formed of an aspect of my character (an aspect which, at least for the moment, he did not consider to be my most important feature); but the same desire on his part struck him as proof of his own mind’s commendable curiosity about social explorations of a kind which might afford him some literary material. When he informed his father that he was bringing a friend of his to dinner, a friend whose name and title he announced in a tone charged with sarcastic satisfaction: ‘The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray’, M. Bloch senior had been seized by a fit of vehement emotion. ‘ The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray!’ he gasped. ‘Egad!’ This was the exclamation which, for him, best expressed deference towards one’s social superiors. The gaze he turned upon this son of his, who was capable of having such friends, was full of admiration and clearly meant: ‘What an amazing boy! Can such a prodigy really be a son of mine?’ The younger Bloch basked in this glory, and looked as though his monthly allowance had just been increased by fifty francs. Within the family, he lived usually in a state of some unease, feeling that his father believed he had gone to the dogs, with his admiration of poets like Leconte de Lisle, Heredia50 and other such ‘Bohemians’. But to be friendly with Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been the president of the Suez Canal Company (Egad!), was an ‘incontrovertible’ advantage. What a pity that the stereoscope, which might have suffered some damage in transit, had been left in Paris! M. Bloch senior was the only one with the skill, or rather the right, to make use of the stereoscope. This he did only on rare, judiciously selected occasions, on special gala evenings when they had taken on extra menservants. These stereoscope sessions conferred upon those who attended them a sort of distinction, a feeling of being singled out and privileged, and there devolved upon the host who was responsible for them a form of prestige akin to that accorded to talent, and which could not have been greater if the images projected had been taken by M. Bloch himself, or if the instrument had been of his own invention. ‘You didn’t have an invitation to Salomon’s yesterday? one member of the family would ask another. – No, I wasn’t one of the chosen few – what was on? – Oh, a great bean-feast, with the stereoscope and everything! – Well, if it was a stereoscope occasion, then I’m sorry to have missed it. I’m told Salomon is just brilliant with it.’ ‘But, look here, M. Bloch senior said to his son, it will be better not to lay on everything for him all at once. Then he’ll still have something to look forward to.’ M. Bloch, like a good father who wishes to do right by his son, had certainly considered sending for the apparatus. However, time was ‘of the essence’, or rather so they thought; but then the dinner had to be postponed, as Saint-Loup could not get away, one of his uncles being expected in Balbec to spend forty-eight hours with Mme de Villeparisis. This uncle was very fond of physical exercise, especially in the form of long walks; and so, as he was coming on foot from the château where he was at present a guest, sleeping overnight at farmhouses along the way, the timing of his arrival at Balbec was rather uncertain. Saint-Loup, who did not wish to risk missing him, even asked me to go to Incarville where there was a telegraph office and send the dispatch which he was in the habit of cabling every day to his mistress. The expected uncle was called Palaméde, a name handed down from the princes of Sicily, his ancestors. In later life, whenever I read historical texts which contained this name, a fine medallion of the Renaissance – some said a genuine antique – a name borne by some podestà or prince of the Church, and which had always remained in the family, being handed on from descendant to descendant, from the chancellery of the Vatican right down to my friend’s uncle, I would experience the special pleasure savoured by those who, in their inability to afford a collection of medals or to constitute a private gallery of art-works, cultivate instead a passion for old names (place-names, as documentary and picturesque as an out-of-date map or isometric projection, a tradesman’s sign or a customary; and baptismal names, with their fine French final syllables, in which one still hears the ring of the long-standing mutilations which our ancestors, by speech defects, the intonation of some ethnic vulgarity or mispronunciation, inflicted on Latin and Saxon words, in a way which later elevated them into the grammarians’ noble statutes), repertoires of antique sonorities which enable them to enjoy private concerts, like those people who acquire a viola da gamba or viola d’amore so as to play ancient music on period instruments. Saint-Loup told me that, even within the most exclusive aristocratic circles, his uncle Palamède was distinguished by being even more exclusive, peculiarly difficult to get to know, disdainful, infatuated with his own nobility, and at the centre of a group which included his brother’s wife and a few other hand-picked associates, known as the circle of the Phoenixes. Even within that inner circle, he was so dreaded for his insolent words that in the past, when fashionable people seeking an introduction had on occasion approached his brother, the latter had been known to refuse out of hand. ‘ No, please don’t ask me for an introduction to Palamède. Even if my wife were to try on your behalf, even if any or all of us were to try, it would be pointless. Or else there would be the danger of his being less than friendly, and I should prefer to avoid that.’ At the Jockey Club, with a few friends, the uncle had drawn up a list of two hundred members whom he would never permit to be introduced to him. In the household of the Comte de Paris, he was dubbed ‘the Prince’, in virtue of his elegance and his haughtiness."
"– Et puis enfin il sera beaucoup pardonné à Bergotte puisqu’il a trouvé mon petit enfant gentil, reprit maman tout en caressant avec ses doigts mes cheveux et en attachant sur moi un long regard rêveur.","""And then, finally, Bergotte will be much forgiven, since he found my little child nice,"" resumed Mama, stroking my hair with her fingers and fixing me with a long dreamy gaze.","""And then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,"" Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze.","– Anyway, my mother said, stroking my hair and gazing dreamily at me, if Bergotte likes my little boy, we’ll not judge him too harshly.’"
"Mais je dus détourner mes regards de Mlle de Stermaria, car déjà, considérant sans doute que faire la connaissance d’une personnalité importante était un acte curieux et bref qui se suffisait à lui-même et qui pour développer tout l’intérêt qu’il comportait n’exigeait qu’une poignée de mains et un coup d’œil pénétrant sans conversation immédiate ni relations ultérieures, son père avait pris congé du bâtonnier et retournait s’asseoir en face d’elle, en se frottant les mains comme un homme qui vient de faire une précieuse acquisition. Quant au bâtonnier, la première émotion de cette entrevue une fois passée, comme les autres jours, on l’entendait par moments s’adressant au maître d’hôtel :","But I had to look away from Mademoiselle de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that getting to know an important personality was a curious and brief act which was sufficient in itself and which, in order to develop all the interest it behaved required only a handshake and a penetrating glance with no immediate conversation or subsequent relations, her father had taken his leave of the chairman and returned to the seat opposite her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the Bâtonnier, the first emotion of this interview once over, as on other days, we heard him at times addressing the butler:","But I was obliged to take my eyes from Mlle. de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that making the acquaintance of an important person was a brief, inquisitive act which was sufficient in itself, and to bring out all the interest that was latent in it required only a handshake and a penetrating stare, without either immediate conversation or any subsequent relations , her father had taken leave of the barrister and returned to sit down facing her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the barrister, once the first emotion of this interview had subsided, then, as on other days, he could be heard every minute addressing the head waiter:","I had to look away from Mlle de Stermaria, whose father, presumably believing that making a person’s acquaintance was a peculiar, perfunctory act, accomplished in a single movement, lending itself to no development worthy of a man’s interest, beyond a mere handshake and a sharp glance, neither requiring conversation on the spot nor leading to any later intercourse, had now taken his leave of the bâtonnier and was on his way back to sit opposite his daughter, rubbing his hands together like a man who has just had a windfall. As for the bâtonnier, once the initial excitement of the encounter had subsided, he was to be heard, as on other days, saying to the head waiter:"
"– Est-ce qu’un écrivain du nom de Bergotte était à ce dîner, Monsieur ? demandai-je timidement pour tâcher de retenir la conversation sur le sujet des Swann.","""Was a writer by the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?"" I asked shyly, trying to hold back the conversation on the subject of the Swanns.","""Was there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?"" I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns.","– And was there a writer by the name of Bergotte at the dinner, sir?’ I asked, in a diffident attempt to keep the conversation focussed on the Swanns."
"En attendant, ce qui me rendait plus aisé de me condamner à cette séparation, c’est que (afin qu’elle se rendît bien compte que, malgré mes affirmations contraires, c’était ma volonté, et non un empêchement, non mon état de santé, qui me privaient de la voir) toutes les fois où je savais d’avance que Gilberte ne serait pas chez ses parents, devait sortir avec une amie, et ne rentrerait pas dîner, j’allais voir Mme Swann (laquelle était redevenue pour moi ce qu’elle était au temps où je voyais si difficilement sa fille et où, les jours où celle-ci ne venait pas aux Champs-Élysées, j’allais me promener avenue des Acacias). De cette façon j’entendrais parler de Gilberte et j’étais sûr qu’elle entendrait ensuite parler de moi et d’une façon qui lui montrerait que je ne tenais pas à elle. Et je trouvais, comme tous ceux qui souffrent, que ma triste situation aurait pu être pire. Car ayant libre entrée dans la demeure où habitait Gilberte, je me disais toujours, bien que décidé à ne pas user de cette faculté, que si jamais ma douleur était trop vive je pourrais la faire cesser. Je n’étais malheureux qu’au jour le jour. Et c’est trop dire encore. Combien de fois par heure (mais maintenant sans l’anxieuse attente qui m’avait étreint les premières semaines après notre brouille, avant d’être retourné chez les Swann) ne me récitais-je pas la lettre que Gilberte m’enverrait bien un jour, m’apporterait peut-être elle-même. La constante vision de ce bonheur imaginaire m’aidait à supporter la destruction du bonheur réel. Pour les femmes qui ne nous aiment pas, comme pour les « disparus », savoir qu’on n’a plus rien à espérer n’empêche pas de continuer à attendre. On vit aux aguets, aux écoutes ; des mères dont le fils est parti en mer pour une exploration dangereuse se figurent à toute minute, et alors que la certitude qu’il a péri est acquise depuis longtemps, qu’il va entrer miraculeusement sauvé et bien portant. Et cette attente, selon la force du souvenir et la résistance des organes, ou bien les aide à traverser les années au bout desquelles elles supporteront que leur fils ne soit plus, d’oublier peu à peu et de survivre – ou bien les fait mourir.","In the meantime, what made it easier for me to condemn myself to this separation is that (so that she would realize that, despite my assertions to the contrary, it was my will, and not an impediment, not my condition health, which deprived me of seeing her) every time I knew in advance that Gilberte would not be at her parents', had to go out with a friend, and would not come home to dinner, I went to see Madame Swann (who had become for me what she was at the time when it was so difficult for me to see her daughter and when, on days when she did not come to the Champs-Élysées, I went for a walk on the avenue des Acacias). That way I would hear about Gilberte and I was sure that she would then hear about me and in a way that would show her that I didn't care about her. And I found, like all those who suffer, that my sad situation could have been worse. Because having free entry into the house where Gilberte lived, I always said to myself, although decided not to use this faculty, that if ever my pain was too acute I could make it stop. I was only miserable day to day. And that's saying too much. How many times an hour (but now without the anxious expectation that had gripped me the first weeks after our estrangement, before returning to the Swanns) did I not recite to myself the letter that Gilberte would send me one day? , would perhaps bring me herself. The constant vision of this imaginary happiness helped me to bear the destruction of real happiness. For the women who don't love us, as for the ""disappeared"", knowing that we have nothing more to hope for does not prevent us from continuing to wait. We live on the lookout, listening; mothers whose son has gone to sea for a dangerous exploration imagine themselves every minute, and while the certainty that he has perished has long been acquired, that he will miraculously return saved and well. And this expectation, depending on the strength of the memory and the resistance of the organs, either helps them to get through the years at the end of which they will bear that their son is no more, to forget little by little and to survive – or else causes them to die. .","In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that (in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her) , whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and (on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs–Elysées) used to repair to the Allée des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an exaggeration. How many times in an hour (but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns') did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the 'missing,' the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her.","Meanwhile, a thing that made it easier for me to condemn myself to this separation was that (with the purpose of making Gilberte clearly aware that, for all my statements to the contrary, it really was by choice, and not because of ill-health, or some such thing beyond my control, that I was staying away from her), if I knew in advance that she was not going to be at home, was going out with a friend and would not be back for dinner, I took to visiting Mme Swann, who thus once more became the person she had been in the days when it had been so hard to see her daughter, when if Gilberte did not turn up at the Champs-Élysées I would take a walk along the avenue des Acacias. In this way not only could I hear about Gilberte, but I was sure she would hear about me too, and in a way which would make it plain I had lost interest in her. Also, like all those in pain, I had the feeling that my sorry situation could have been worse. Since I had open access to her house, I lived with the knowledge (even though I was resolved never to avail myself of the possibility) that, if ever my suffering became too much for me, I could always bring it to an end. So I was only unhappy for one day at a time. And even that is an overstatement. How many times per hour (but now free of the fever of expectation that had so anguished me in the first weeks after we had fallen out, before I started going back to the Swanns’ house) did I read to myself the letter that Gilberte would definitely send me one day – which she might even bring to me herself! The constant vision of this imaginary happiness helped me to bear the ruining of my real happiness. With a woman who does not love us, as with someone who has died, the knowledge that there is nothing left to hope for does not prevent us from going on waiting. One lives in a state of alertness, eyes and ears open; a mother whose son has gone on a dangerous sea voyage always has the feeling, even when she has long known for certain that he has perished, that he is just about to come through the door, saved by a miracle, unscathed. This waiting, depending on the strength of her memory and her bodily resistance, may enable her to last out the years which will eventually bring her to an acceptance of the death of her son, so that she gradually forgets and goes on living – or it may kill her."
"– Un jour un des hommes qui est aujourd’hui des plus en vue dans le faubourg Saint-Germain, comme eût dit Balzac, mais qui dans une première période assez fâcheuse montrait des goûts bizarres, avait demandé à mon oncle de venir dans cette garçonnière. Mais à peine arrivé ce ne fut pas aux femmes, mais à mon oncle Palamède, qu’il se mit à faire une déclaration. Mon oncle fit semblant de ne pas comprendre, emmena sous un prétexte ses deux amis, ils revinrent, prirent le coupable, le déshabillèrent, le frappèrent jusqu’au sang, et par un froid de dix degrés au-dessous de zéro le jetèrent à coups de pieds dehors où il fut trouvé à demi mort, si bien que la justice fit une enquête à laquelle le malheureux eut toute la peine du monde à la faire renoncer. Mon oncle ne se livrerait plus aujourd’hui à une exécution aussi cruelle et tu n’imagines pas le nombre d’hommes du peuple, lui si hautain avec les gens du monde, qu’il prend en affection, qu’il protège, quitte à être payé d’ingratitude. Ce sera un domestique qui l’aura servi dans un hôtel et qu’il placera à Paris, ou un paysan à qui il fera apprendre un métier. C’est même le côté assez gentil qu’il y a chez lui, par contraste avec le côté mondain. » Saint-Loup appartenait, en effet, à ce genre de jeunes gens du monde, situés à une altitude où on ait pu faire pousser ces expressions : « Ce qu’il y a même d’assez gentil chez lui, son côté assez gentil », semences assez précieuses, produisant très vite une manière de concevoir les choses dans laquelle on se compte pour rien, et le « peuple » pour tout ; en somme tout le contraire de l’orgueil plébéien. « Il paraît qu’on ne peut se figurer comme il donnait le ton, comme il faisait la loi à toute la société dans sa jeunesse. Pour lui en toute circonstance il faisait ce qui lui paraissait le plus agréable, le plus commode, mais aussitôt c’était imité par les snobs. S’il avait eu soif au théâtre et s’était fait apporter à boire dans le fond de sa loge, les petits salons qu’il y avait derrière chacune se remplissaient, la semaine suivante, de rafraîchissements. Un été pluvieux où il avait un peu de rhumatisme, il s’était commandé un pardessus d’une vigogne souple mais chaude qui ne sert que pour faire des couvertures de voyage et dont il avait respecté les raies bleues et oranges. Les grands tailleurs se virent commander aussitôt par leurs clients des pardessus bleus et frangés, à longs poils. Si pour une raison quelconque il désirait ôter tout caractère de solennité à un dîner dans un château où il passait une journée, et pour marquer cette nuance n’avait pas apporté d’habits et s’était mis à table avec le veston de l’après-midi, la mode devenait de dîner à la campagne en veston. Que pour manger un gâteau il se servît, au lieu de sa cuiller, d’une fourchette ou d’un couvert de son invention commandé par lui à un orfèvre, ou de ses doigts, il n’était plus permis de faire autrement. Il avait eu envie de réentendre certains quatuors de Beethoven (car avec toutes ses idées saugrenues il est loin d’être bête, et est fort doué) et avait fait venir des artistes pour les jouer chaque semaine, pour lui et quelques amis. La grande élégance fut cette année-là de donner des réunions peu nombreuses où on entendait de la musique de chambre. Je crois d’ailleurs qu’il ne s’est pas ennuyé dans la vie. Beau comme il a été, il a dû avoir des femmes ! Je ne pourrais pas vous dire d’ailleurs exactement lesquelles parce qu’il est très discret. Mais je sais qu’il a bien trompé ma pauvre tante. Ce qui n’empêche pas qu’il était délicieux avec elle, qu’elle l’adorait, et qu’il l’a pleurée pendant des années. Quand il est à Paris, il va encore au cimetière presque chaque jour. »","– One day one of the men who today is one of the most prominent in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, as Balzac would have said, but who in a rather unfortunate first period showed strange tastes, had asked my uncle to come to this bachelor pad . But as soon as he arrived, it was not to the women, but to my uncle Palamède, that he began to make a declaration. My uncle pretended not to understand, took his two friends away under some pretext, they came back, took the culprit, undressed him, beat him until he bled, and in the cold of ten degrees below zero threw him with blows. feet outside where he was found half dead, so that justice made an investigation which the unfortunate had all the trouble in the world to make it give up. My uncle would no longer indulge in such a cruel execution today and you cannot imagine the number of men of the people, he so haughty with the people of the world, whom he takes in affection, whom he protects, leaves to be paid with ingratitude. It will be a servant who will have served him in a hotel and whom he will place in Paris, or a peasant whom he will make learn a trade. It is even the rather nice side that there is in him, in contrast to the worldly side. Saint-Loup belonged, in fact, to that kind of young people of the world, located at an altitude where these expressions could have grown: ""What is even quite nice about him, his rather nice side », rather precious seeds, very quickly producing a way of conceiving things in which we count ourselves for nothing, and the “people” for everything; in short, the complete opposite of plebeian pride. “It seems that one cannot imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for all of society in his youth. For him in all circumstances he did what seemed to him the most pleasant, the most convenient, but it was immediately imitated by the snobs. If he had been thirsty at the theater and had a drink brought to the back of his box, the little salons behind each were filled the following week with refreshments. One rainy summer when he had a little rheumatism, he had ordered himself an overcoat of a supple but warm vicuña which is only used for making travel blankets and whose blue and orange stripes he had respected. The great tailors were immediately ordered by their customers blue and fringed overcoats, with long hairs. If for any reason he wanted to remove all formality from a dinner in a castle where he was spending a day, and to mark this nuance had not brought any clothes and had sat down to table with the jacket of the afternoon, the fashion became to dine in the country in a jacket. That to eat a cake he used, instead of his spoon, a fork or a cutlery of his invention ordered by him from a goldsmith, or his fingers, it was no longer permitted to do otherwise. He had wanted to hear some of Beethoven's quartets again (because with all his absurd ideas he is far from being stupid, and is very talented) and had brought in artists to play them every week, for him and a few friends. The great elegance that year was to hold few meetings where chamber music was heard. I also believe that he was not bored in life. Handsome as he was, he must have had wives! I could not tell you exactly which ones because he is very discreet. But I know he deceived my poor aunt. Which does not prevent him from being delicious with her, that she adored him, and that he mourned her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery almost every day. »","""One day, a man who just now is very much in the eye, as Balzac would say, of the Faubourg Saint–Germain, but who at a rather awkward period of his early life displayed odd tastes, asked my uncle to let him come to this place. But no sooner had he arrived than it was not to the ladies but to my uncle Palamède that he began to make overtures. My uncle pretended not to understand, made an excuse to send for his two friends; they appeared on the scene, seized the offender, stripped him, thrashed him till he bled, and then with twenty degrees of frost outside kicked him into the street where he was found more dead than alive; so much so that the police started an inquiry which the poor devil had the greatest difficulty in getting them to abandon. My uncle would never go in for such drastic methods now , in fact you can't conceive the number of men of humble position that he, who is so haughty with people in society, has shewn his affection, taken under his wing, even if he is paid for it with ingratitude. It may be a servant who has looked after him in a hotel, for whom he will find a place in Paris, or a farm–labourer whom he will pay to have taught a trade. That is really the rather nice side of his character, in contrast to his social side."" Saint– Loup indeed belonged to that type of young men of fashion, situated at an altitude at which it has been possible to cultivate such expressions as: ""What is really rather nice about him,"" ""His rather nice side,"" precious seeds which produce very rapidly a way of looking at things in which one counts oneself as nothing and the 'people' as everything; the exact opposite, in a word, of plebeian pride. ""It seems, it is quite impossible to imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for the whole of society when he was a young man. He acted entirely for himself; in any circumstances he did what seemed pleasing to himself, what was most convenient, but at once the snobs would start copying him. If he felt thirsty at the play, and sent out from his box for a drink, the little sitting–rooms behind all the boxes would be filled, a week later, with refreshments. One wet summer, when he had a touch of rheumatism, he ordered an ulster of a loose but warm vicuna wool, which is used only for travelling rugs, and kept the blue and orange stripes shewing. The big tailors at once received orders from all their customers for blue and orange ulsters of rough wool. If he had some reason for wishing to keep every trace of ceremony out of a dinner in a country house where he was spending the day, and to point the distinction had come without evening clothes and sat down to table in the suit he had been wearing that afternoon, it became the fashion, when you were dining in the country, not to dress. If he was eating some special sweet and instead of taking his spoon used a knife, or a special implement of his own invention which he had had made for him by a silversmith, or his fingers, it at once became wrong to eat it in any other way. He wanted once to hear some Beethoven quartets again (for with all his preposterous ideas he is no fool, mind, he has great gifts) and arranged for some musicians to come and play them to him and a few friends once a week. The ultra–fashionable thing that season was to give quite small parties, with chamber music. I should say he's not done at all badly out of life. With his looks, he must have had any number of women! I can't tell you exactly whom, for he is very discreet. But I do know that he was thoroughly unfaithful to my poor aunt. Not that that prevented his being always perfectly charming to her, and her adoring him; he was in mourning for her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery nearly every day.""","‘One day, a fellow who has nowadays become what Balzac would have called “one of the most prominent members of the Faubourg Saint-Germain”, but who in those early days went through an unfortunate period when he showed rather untoward tendencies, made an appointment with my uncle at the flat. When he got there, the chap made his intentions quite clear – but towards my uncle Palamède, not towards the women! My uncle pretended not to understand, then on some pretext or other sent for his two friends. They turned up, took the miscreant, stripped the clothes off him, beat him till the blood ran red, then kicked him out – it was ten below zero, and when he was found he was lucky to be alive. The police started an investigation, and the fellow had great difficulty in getting them to drop it. These days, my uncle would never have anything to do with such a cruel punishment – despite his unapproachability with people of his own station, you’ve no idea of the number of working-class men whom he takes a liking to, whom he takes under his wing, though he may well get no thanks for it in the end. A footman who attends him in a hotel somewhere and whom he’ll set up in Paris; a peasant lad whom he gets apprenticed to a trade, that sort of thing. It’s just this rather nice side of his nature, as opposed to his society side.’ Saint-Loup was one of those young men of fashion who live at an altitude where certain expressions can take root and grow, for instance, ‘The rather nice side of his nature’ or ‘There’s rather a nice thing about him’, rather precious blooms, which soon turn into a way of seeing things that reduces oneself to nothing, while exalting ‘the proletariat’; quite the opposite, in fact, of the plebeian’s pride in his origins. ‘It seems we have no idea of the way he used to set the trends as a young man, the standards he set for the whole of society. At all times, he only ever did what was convenient, what struck him as enjoyable, but whatever it was, it was instantly imitated by all the snobs. If he felt thirsty at the theatre, say, and sent out for a drink to be brought to him in his box, the following week all the little sitting-rooms behind the boxes were full of refreshments. Or one rather wet summer, when he’d had a touch of rheumatism, he wanted a vicuna overcoat – it’s a cloth which is soft but warm, normally used only for travelling-rugs – and the one he got still had the blue and orange stripes on it. All the best tailors were immediately inundated with orders for shaggy blue overcoats with a fringe. On another occasion, if he was spending a day or two at a château, he might turn up without his tails, because for some reason he felt like dining without any great ceremony; and so he would go in to dinner wearing his town clothes, and in country houses it became the fashion not to change for dinner. If he took to eating his cake not with a spoon, but with a fork or some other instrument of his own design specially made for him by a goldsmith, or even with his fingers, then it was soon inconceivable not to do likewise. Once when he wanted to be reminded of some of the quartets of Beethoven (despite his preposterous ideas, he’s no fool, he’s a gifted man) he just got a group of musicians to come to his house each week, and they played them for him and a few of his friends.51 So the really elegant thing that year was to hold very select little gatherings, with chamber music. I’m pretty sure he’s had a fair amount of pleasure in life. A man as handsome as he was – think of the number of women he must have had! I’ve no idea who they were, as he’s a very discreet man. But I do know he was very unfaithful to my late aunt. Mind you, he was also very attentive and charming towards her, and she adored him, and after her death he was inconsolable for a long time. Even now, when he’s in Paris, he still visits the cemetery nearly every day.’"
"Ma grand’mère les passait au directeur, et à cause de ses gentillesses pour moi, j’étais désolé de ce manque d’égards dont il paraissait souffrir.","My grandmother passed them on to the manager, and because of his kindness to me, I was sorry for this lack of consideration from which he seemed to suffer.","My grandmother handed hers to the manager, and because he had been so nice to me I was distressed by this want of consideration, which seemed to pain him.","My grandmother handed them to the manager; and because he was in the habit of being pleasant to me, I was dismayed by this inconsiderateness, which seemed to be hurtful to him."
"Ma grand’mère fut enchantée de M. de Charlus. Sans doute il attachait une extrême importance à toutes les questions de naissance et de situation mondaine, et ma grand’mère l’avait remarqué mais sans rien de cette sévérité où entrent d’habitude une secrète envie et l’irritation de voir un autre se réjouir d’avantages qu’on voudrait et qu’on ne peut posséder. Comme au contraire ma grand’mère, contente de son sort et ne regrettant nullement de ne pas vivre dans une société plus brillante, ne se servait que de son intelligence pour observer les travers de M. de Charlus, elle parlait de l’oncle de Saint-Loup avec cette bienveillance détachée, souriante, presque sympathique, par laquelle nous récompensons l’objet de notre observation désintéressée du plaisir qu’elle nous procure, et d’autant plus que cette fois l’objet était un personnage dont elle trouvait que les prétentions sinon légitimes, du moins pittoresques, le faisaient assez vivement trancher sur les personnes qu’elle avait généralement l’occasion de voir. Mais c’était surtout en faveur de l’intelligence et de la sensibilité, qu’on devinait extrêmement vives chez M. de Charlus, au contraire de tant de gens du monde dont se moquait Saint-Loup, que ma grand’mère lui avait si aisément pardonné son préjugé aristocratique. Celui-ci n’avait pourtant pas été sacrifié par l’oncle, comme par le neveu, à des qualités supérieures. M. de Charlus l’avait plutôt concilié avec elles. Possédant, comme descendant des ducs de Nemours et des princes de Lamballe, des archives, des meubles, des tapisseries, des portraits faits pour ses aïeux par Raphaël, par Vélasquez, par Boucher, pouvant dire justement qu’il visitait un musée et une incomparable bibliothèque rien qu’en parcourant ses souvenirs de famille, il plaçait au contraire au rang d’où son neveu l’avait fait déchoir tout l’héritage de l’aristocratie. Peut-être aussi moins idéologue que Saint-Loup, se payant moins de mots, plus réaliste observateur des hommes, ne voulait-il pas négliger un élément essentiel de prestige à leurs yeux et qui, s’il donnait à son imagination des jouissances désintéressées, pouvait être souvent pour son activité utilitaire un adjuvant puissamment efficace. Le débat reste ouvert entre les hommes de cette sorte et ceux qui obéissent à l’idéal intérieur qui les pousse à se défaire de ces avantages pour chercher uniquement à le réaliser, semblables en cela aux peintres, aux écrivains qui renoncent à leur virtuosité, aux peuples artistes qui se modernisent, aux peuples guerriers prenant l’initiative du désarmement universel, aux gouvernements absolus qui se font démocratiques et abrogent de dures lois, bien souvent sans que la réalité récompense leur noble effort ; car les uns perdent leur talent, les autres leur prédominance séculaire ; le pacifisme multiplie quelquefois les guerres et l’indulgence la criminalité. Si les efforts de sincérité et d’émancipation de Saint-Loup ne pouvaient être trouvés que très nobles, à en juger par le résultat extérieur, il était permis de se féliciter qu’ils eussent fait défaut chez M. de Charlus, lequel avait fait transporter chez lui une grande partie des admirables boiseries de l’hôtel Guermantes au lieu de les échanger, comme son neveu, contre un mobilier modern style, des Lebourg et des Guillaumin. Il n’en était pas moins vrai que l’idéal de M. de Charlus était fort factice, et si cette épithète peut être rapprochée du mot idéal, tout autant mondain qu’artistique. À quelques femmes de grande beauté et de rare culture dont les aïeules avaient été deux siècles plus tôt mêlées à toute la gloire et à toute l’élégance de l’ancien régime, il trouvait une distinction qui le faisait pouvoir se plaire seulement avec elles, et sans doute l’admiration qu’il leur avait vouée était sincère, mais de nombreuses réminiscences d’histoire et d’art évoquées par leurs noms y entraient pour une grande part, comme des souvenirs de l’antiquité sont une des raisons du plaisir qu’un lettré trouve à lire une ode d’Horace peut-être inférieure à des poèmes de nos jours qui laisseraient ce même lettré indifférent. Chacune de ces femmes à côté d’une jolie bourgeoise était pour lui ce que sont à une toile contemporaine représentant une route ou une noce, ces tableaux anciens dont on sait l’histoire, depuis le Pape ou le Roi qui les commandèrent, en passant par tels personnages auprès de qui leur présence, par don, achat, prise ou héritage nous rappelle quelque événement, ou tout au moins quelque alliance d’un intérêt historique, par conséquent des connaissances que nous avons acquises, leur donne une nouvelle utilité, augmente le sentiment de la richesse des possessions de notre mémoire ou de notre érudition. M. de Charlus se félicitait qu’un préjugé analogue au sien, en empêchant ces quelques grandes dames de frayer avec des femmes d’un sang moins pur, les offrît à son culte intactes, dans leur noblesse inaltérée, comme telle façade du XVIIIe siècle soutenue par ses colonnes plates de marbre rose et à laquelle les temps nouveaux n’ont rien changé.","My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached extreme importance to all questions of birth and social status, and my grandmother had noticed him, but without any of that severity which usually includes a secret envy and the irritation of seeing another rejoice in advantages which one would like and which one cannot possess. As, on the contrary, my grandmother, content with her lot and in no way regretting not living in a more brilliant society, only used her intelligence to observe the failings of M. de Charlus, she spoke of the uncle of Saint-Loup with that detached, smiling, almost sympathetic benevolence with which we reward the object of our disinterested observation for the pleasure it gives us, and all the more so since this time the object was a character whom she found pretensions, if not legitimate, at least picturesque, made her decide rather sharply on the people she generally had occasion to see. But it was above all in favor of intelligence and sensibility, which one guessed to be extremely lively in M. de Charlus, contrary to so many people of the world whom Saint-Loup made fun of, that my grandmother told him. so easily pardoned his aristocratic prejudice. The latter, however, had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as by the nephew, to superior qualities. M. de Charlus had rather reconciled him with them. Possessing, as a descendant of the Dukes of Nemours and the Princes of Lamballe, archives, furniture, tapestries, portraits made for his ancestors by Raphaël, Velasquez, Boucher, being able to say precisely that he visited a museum and an incomparable library, just by going through his family memories, he placed, on the contrary, in the rank from which his nephew had made him fall all the heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also less of an ideologue than Saint-Loup, using fewer words, a more realistic observer of men, he did not want to neglect an essential element of prestige in their eyes and which, if he gave his imagination disinterested enjoyment , could often be a powerfully effective adjuvant for its utilitarian activity. The debate remains open between men of this kind and those who obey the inner ideal which pushes them to get rid of these advantages in order to seek only to realize them, similar in this to painters, writers who renounce their virtuosity, artistic peoples who are modernizing, to warlike peoples taking the initiative of universal disarmament, to absolute governments which are becoming democratic and repealing harsh laws, very often without reality rewarding their noble effort; for some lose their talent, others their secular predominance; pacifism sometimes multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If the efforts of sincerity and emancipation of Saint-Loup could only be found very noble, judging by the external result, it was permissible to congratulate oneself that they had been lacking in M. de Charlus, who had transport home a large part of the admirable woodwork of the Hôtel Guermantes instead of exchanging them, like his nephew, for modern style furniture by the Lebourgs and Guillaumins. It was none the less true that the ideal of M. de Charlus was very factitious, and if this epithet can be compared to the word ideal, it was just as much worldly as it was artistic. In a few women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestors had two centuries earlier been mingled with all the glory and all the elegance of the old regime, he found a distinction which enabled him to be able to please himself only with them, and doubtless the admiration which he had devoted to them was sincere, but many reminiscences of history and art evoked by their names entered there for a great part, as memories of antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure that a scholar finds in reading an ode by Horace perhaps inferior to poems of our day which would leave this same scholar indifferent. Each of these women next to a pretty bourgeois was for him what are to a contemporary canvas representing a road or a wedding, these old paintings whose history we know, from the Pope or the King who commissioned them, passing by such persons with whom their presence, by gift, purchase, taking or inheritance reminds us of some event, or at least some alliance of historical interest, consequently of the knowledge we have acquired, gives them a new utility, increases the feeling of the richness of the possessions of our memory or our scholarship. M. de Charlus congratulated himself that a prejudice analogous to his own, by preventing these few great ladies from consorting with women of less pure blood, offered them to his cult intact, in their unaltered nobility, like some facade of the eighteenth century. supported by its flat columns of pink marble and to which the new times have changed nothing.","My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached an extreme importance to all questions of birth and social position, and my grandmother had remarked this, but without any trace of that severity which as a rule embodies a secret envy and the annoyance of seeing some one else enjoy an advantage which one would like but cannot oneself possess. As on the other hand my grandmother, content with her lot and never for a moment regretting that she did not move in a more brilliant sphere, employed only her intellect in observing the eccentricities of M. de Charlus, she spoke of Saint– Loup's uncle with that detached, smiling, almost affectionate kindness with which we reward the object of our disinterested study for the pleasure that it has given us, all the more that this time the object was a person with regard to whom she found that his if not legitimate, at any rate picturesque pretensions shewed him in vivid contrast to the people whom she generally had occasion to see. But it was especially in consideration of his intelligence and sensibility, qualities which it was easy to see that M. de Charlus, unlike so many of the people in society whom Saint–Loup derided, possessed in a marked degree, that my grandmother had so readily forgiven him his aristocratic prejudice. And yet this had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as it was by the nephew, to higher qualities. Rather, M. de Charlus had reconciled it with them. Possessing, by virtue of his descent from the Ducs de Nemours and Princes de Lamballe, documents, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velasquez, Boucher, justified in saying that he was visiting a museum and a matchless library when he was merely turning over his family relics at home, he placed in the rank from which his nephew had degraded it the whole heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also, being less metaphysical than Saint– Loup, less satisfied with words, more of a realist in his study of men, he did not care to neglect a factor that was essential to his prestige in their eyes and, if it gave certain disinterested pleasures to his imagination, could often be a powerfully effective aid to his utilitarian activities. No agreement can ever be reached between men of his sort and those who obey the ideal within them which urges them to strip themselves bare of such advantages so that they may seek only to realise that ideal, similar in that respect to the painters, the writers who renounce their virtuosity, the artistic peoples who modernise themselves, warrior peoples who take the initiative in a move for universal disarmament, absolute governments which turn democratic and repeal their harsh laws, though as often as not the sequel fails to reward their noble effort; for the men lose their talent, the nations their secular predominance; 'pacificism' often multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If Saint–Loup's efforts towards sincerity and emancipation were only to be commended as most noble, to judge by their visible result, one could still be thankful that they had failed to bear fruit in M. de Charlus, who had transferred to his own home much of the admirable panelling from the Guermantes house, instead of substituting, like his nephew, a 'modern style' of decoration, employing Lebourg or Guillaumin. It was none the less true that M. de Charlus's ideal was highly artificial, and, if the epithet can be applied to the word ideal, as much social as artistic. In certain women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestresses, two centuries earlier, had shared in all the glory and grace of the old order, he found a distinction which made him take pleasure only in their society, and no doubt the admiration for them which he had protested was sincere, but countless reminiscences; historical and artistic, called forth by their names, entered into and formed a great part of it, just as suggestions of classical antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure which a booklover finds in reading an Ode of Horace that is perhaps inferior to poems of our own day which would leave the same booklover cold. Any of these women by the side of a pretty commoner was for him what are, hanging beside a contemporary canvas representing a procession or a wedding, those old pictures the history of which we know, from the Pope or King who ordered them, through the hands of people whose acquisition of them, by gift, purchase, conquest or inheritance, recalls to us some event or at least some alliance of historic interest, and consequently some knowledge that we ourselves have acquired, gives it a fresh utility, increases our sense of the richness of the possessions of our memory or of our erudition. M. de Charlus might be thankful that a prejudice similar to his own, by preventing these several great ladies from mixing with women whose blood was less pure, presented them for his veneration unspoiled, in their unaltered nobility, like an eighteenth–century house–front supported on its flat columns of pink marble, in which the passage of time has wrought no change.","My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. There was no doubt that he did attach extreme importance to all matters of birth and social status; but her awareness of this was uncoloured by any of the severe disapproval which is the mark of a secret envy and the vexation of seeing someone else enjoying advantages which one would like to have, but which are out of reach. My grandmother, quite content with her lot in life, untroubled by any wish to live in grander society, exercised on M. de Charlus only her mind, which enabled her to observe his foibles and to speak of this uncle of Saint-Loup with the benevolent, smiling detachment that is close to liking, and is our way of rewarding the object of our disinterested observation for the pleasures we find in it, in this case especially because this object was a personage full of pretensions which, though possibly misplaced, she found at least picturesque, and which sharply differentiated him from all the other people with whom she usually had occasion to mix. But there were things in M. de Charlus, such as intelligence and sensibility, which one sensed were of acute potency, marking him off from the many society people whom Saint-Loup found painfully amusing; and it was especially these things which made my grandmother so indulgent towards his aristocratic bias. Unlike the nephew, the uncle had not sacrificed this preference to values seen as higher: he had reconciled it with them. In his capacity as descendant of the Ducs de Nemours and the Princes de Lamballe, he owned archives, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velázquez or Boucher, and could quite properly have said, when merely glancing over a few family souvenirs, that he was visiting a museum or some grand library; and it was this rich heritage of the aristocracy which he valued so highly and his nephew so little. In addition, there being less of the ideologue in him than in Saint-Loup, less readiness to take fine words at face value, more realism in his judgment of men, he may have been loth to neglect something which they see as essential to prestige, something which, as well as affording its disinterested delights to his imagination, could also be powerfully effective as an aid to his practical purposes. There is no common ground between men of his sort and those who aspire to an inner ideal which urges them to divest themselves of such advantages and to devote themselves solely to it, who thereby show a similarity with painters or writers who renounce their virtuosity, artistic peoples who embrace modernization, warlike peoples who opt for total disarmament, dictatorial governments which turn democratic and repeal harsh laws, though often the world will not reward them for this noble effort: some lose their talent, some their hereditary predominance; pacifism can lead to war and indulgence can foster crime. However noble and sincere the impulse of Saint-Loup towards emancipation, when one saw the result, one was convinced that it was just as well it was not shared by M. de Charlus, who had had most of the admirable wood panelling transferred from the Guermantes’ family hôtel to his own house, rather than replace it, as his nephew had done, by an art nouveau décor and paintings by Lebourg and Guillaumin.56 Even so, M. de Charlus’s ideal was factitious in the extreme, and – if one may say such a thing of an ideal – it was one which aspired towards the fashionable world as much as to the world of art. In certain women who were exceptionally beautiful and extraordinarily cultivated, whose great-great-grandmothers, two centuries before, had been part of the full glory and elegance of the ancien régime, he perceived a form of distinction which made them the only women whose company he found at all pleasant; and though no doubt this admiration was sincere, it was coloured by the reminders of history and art which rang for him in their names, just as reminders of Antiquity may explain the pleasure a cultured man enjoys in an ode of Horace, though it may be inferior to poems of our own day which leave him indifferent. In the view of M. de Charlus, a pretty woman of the middle classes, in relation to any of these women, was like a contemporary painting of a road or a wedding-party in relation to an old master, the history of which we know, from the pope or the king who commissioned it to the various personages in whose company it has lived, as a result of donation, purchase, legacy or looting, and because of which it can recall an event or at least a union of two houses, some historical interest, some element of learning, all of which adds to it an extra dimension of usefulness, and increases our appreciation of the richness of what we can possess through memory or erudition. M. de Charlus drew comfort too from the fact that a similar bias to his own prevented these few great ladies from frequenting other women of lesser breeding, thus enabling him to worship them in their unimpaired nobility, as intact as an eighteenth-century façade still supported by its shallow columns of pink marble, unchanged in any particular by modern times."
"Bien qu’on dise avec raison qu’il n’y a pas de progrès, pas de découvertes en art, mais seulement dans les sciences, et que chaque artiste recommençant pour son compte un effort individuel ne peut y être aidé ni entravé par les efforts de tout autre, il faut pourtant reconnaître que dans la mesure où l’art met en lumière certaines lois, une fois qu’une industrie les a vulgarisées, l’art antérieur perd rétrospectivement un peu de son originalité. Depuis les débuts d’Elstir, nous avons connu ce qu’on appelle « d’admirables » photographies de paysages et de villes. Si on cherche à préciser ce que les amateurs désignent dans ce cas par cette épithète, on verra qu’elle s’applique d’ordinaire à quelque image singulière d’une chose connue, image différente de celles que nous avons l’habitude de voir, singulière et pourtant vraie et qui à cause de cela est pour nous doublement saisissante parce qu’elle nous étonne, nous fait sortir de nos habitudes, et tout à la fois nous fait rentrer en nous-même en nous rappelant une impression. Par exemple telle de ces photographies « magnifiques » illustrera une loi de la perspective, nous montrera telle cathédrale que nous avons l’habitude de voir au milieu de la ville, prise au contraire d’un point choisi d’où elle aura l’air trente fois plus haute que les maisons et faisant éperon au bord du fleuve d’où elle est en réalité distante. Or, l’effort d’Elstir de ne pas exposer les choses telles qu’il savait qu’elles étaient, mais selon ces illusions optiques dont notre vision première est faite, l’avait précisément amené à mettre en lumière certaines de ces lois de perspective, plus frappantes alors, car l’art était le premier à les dévoiler. Un fleuve, à cause du tournant de son cours, un golfe à cause du rapprochement apparent des falaises, avaient l’air de creuser au milieu de la plaine ou des montagnes un lac absolument fermé de toutes parts. Dans un tableau pris de Balbec par une torride journée d’été, un rentrant de la mer semblait enfermé dans des murailles de granit rose, n’être pas la mer, laquelle commençait plus loin. La continuité de l’océan n’était suggérée que par des mouettes qui, tournoyant sur ce qui semblait au spectateur de la pierre, humaient au contraire l’humidité du flot. D’autres lois se dégageaient de cette même toile comme, au pied des immenses falaises, la grâce lilliputienne des voiles blanches sur le miroir bleu où elles semblaient des papillons endormis, et certains contrastes entre la profondeur des ombres et la pâleur de la lumière. Ces jeux des ombres, que la photographie a banalisés aussi, avaient intéressé Elstir au point qu’il s’était complu autrefois à peindre de véritables mirages, où un château coiffé d’une tour apparaissait comme un château circulaire complètement prolongé d’une tour à son faîte, et en bas d’une tour inverse, soit que la pureté extraordinaire d’un beau temps donnât à l’ombre qui se reflétait dans l’eau la dureté et l’éclat de la pierre, soit que les brumes du matin rendissent la pierre aussi vaporeuse que l’ombre. De même au delà de la mer, derrière une rangée de bois une autre mer commençait, rosée par le coucher du soleil et qui était le ciel. La lumière, inventant comme de nouveaux solides, poussait la coque du bateau qu’elle frappait, en retrait de celle qui était dans l’ombre, et disposait comme les degrés d’un escalier de cristal la surface matériellement plane, mais brisée par l’éclairage de la mer au matin. Un fleuve qui passe sous les ponts d’une ville était pris d’un point de vue tel qu’il apparaissait entièrement disloqué, étalé ici en lac, aminci là en filet, rompu ailleurs par l’interposition d’une colline couronnée de bois où le citadin va le soir respirer la fraîcheur du soir ; et le rythme même de cette ville bouleversée n’était assuré que par la verticale inflexible des clochers qui ne montaient pas, mais plutôt, selon le fil à plomb de la pesanteur marquant la cadence comme dans une marche triomphale, semblaient tenir en suspens au-dessous d’eux toute la masse plus confuse des maisons étagées dans la brume, le long du fleuve écrasé et décousu. Et (comme les premières œuvres d’Elstir dataient de l’époque où on agrémentait les paysages par la présence d’un personnage) sur la falaise ou dans la montagne, le chemin, cette partie à demi humaine de la nature, subissait comme le fleuve ou l’océan les éclipses de la perspective. Et soit qu’une arête montagneuse, ou la brume d’une cascade, ou la mer, empêchât de suivre la continuité de la route, visible pour le promeneur mais non pour nous, le petit personnage humain en habits démodés perdu dans ces solitudes semblait souvent arrêté devant un abîme, le sentier qu’il suivait finissant là, tandis que, trois cents mètres plus haut dans ces bois de sapins, c’est d’un œil attendri et d’un cœur rassuré que nous voyions reparaître la mince blancheur de son sable hospitalier au pas du voyageur, mais dont le versant de la montagne nous avait dérobé, contournant la cascade ou le golfe, les lacets intermédiaires.","Although it is rightly said that there is no progress, no discoveries in art, but only in the sciences, and that each artist beginning on his own account an individual effort cannot be helped or hindered by the efforts of any other, it must however be recognized that insofar as the art brings to light certain laws, once an industry has popularized them, the prior art retrospectively loses some of its originality. Since the beginnings of Elstir, we have known what are called ""admirable"" photographs of landscapes and cities. If we seek to specify what amateurs designate in this case by this epithet, we will see that it usually applies to some singular image of a known thing, an image different from those we are used to seeing. , singular and yet true and which because of this is doubly striking for us because it surprises us, makes us get out of our habits, and all at the same time makes us return to ourselves by recalling an impression. For example, one of these ""magnificent"" photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will show us a cathedral that we are used to seeing in the middle of the city, taken on the contrary from a chosen point from which it will look thirty times higher than the houses and forming a spur on the edge of the river from which it is in reality distant. Now, Elstir's effort not to expose things as he knew they were, but according to those optical illusions of which our primary vision is made, had led him precisely to bring to light some of these laws of perspective, more striking then, because art was the first to unveil them. A river, because of the bend in its course, a gulf because of the apparent rapprochement of the cliffs, seemed to hollow out in the middle of the plain or the mountains a lake absolutely closed on all sides. In a painting taken from Balbec on a torrid summer day, a re-entrant from the sea seemed enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began further away. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by seagulls which, whirling on what seemed to the viewer to be stone, were instead inhaling the humidity of the waves. Other laws emerged from this same canvas such as, at the foot of the immense cliffs, the Lilliputian grace of the white sails on the blue mirror where they looked like sleeping butterflies, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallor of the light. These games of shadows, which photography has also trivialized, had interested Elstir to the point that he had once taken pleasure in painting real mirages, where a castle topped with a tower appeared like a circular castle completely extended by a tower. at its top, and at the bottom of an opposite tower, either the extraordinary purity of fine weather gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brilliance of stone, or the mists of the morning make the stone as misty as the shadow. Likewise beyond the sea, behind a row of woods, another sea began, dewed by the sunset and which was the sky. The light, inventing like new solids, pushed the hull of the boat it struck, set back from that which was in shadow, and arranged like the steps of a crystal staircase the materially flat surface, but broken by the illumination of the sea at morning. A river which passes under the bridges of a city was taken from a point of view such that it appeared entirely dislocated, spread out here in a lake, thinned there in a trickle, broken elsewhere by the interposition of a hill crowned with wood. where the city-dweller goes in the evening to breathe the freshness of the evening; and the very rhythm of this shattered city was ensured only by the inflexible verticality of the steeples which did not rise, but rather, according to the plumb line of gravity marking the pace as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense above. below them all the more confused mass of houses stacked in the mist, along the crushed and disjointed river. And (as Elstir's first works dated from the time when landscapes were embellished by the presence of a character) on the cliff or in the mountains, the path, this half-human part of nature, suffered like the river or ocean the eclipses of perspective. And whether a mountain ridge, or the mist of a waterfall, or the sea, prevented following the continuity of the road, visible for the walker but not for us, the little human figure in old-fashioned clothes lost in these solitudes seemed often stopped before an abyss, the path he was following ending there, while, three hundred meters higher in these fir woods, it was with tender eyes and reassured hearts that we saw the thin whiteness reappear of its hospitable sand at the foot of the traveller, but of which the slope of the mountain had stolen us, circumventing the waterfall or the gulf, the intermediate laces.","Although we are justified in saying that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that the artist who begins afresh upon his own account an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered by the efforts of all the others, we must nevertheless admit that, in so far as art brings into prominence certain laws, once an industry has taken those laws and vulgarised them, the art that was first in the field loses, in retrospect, a little of its originality. Since Elstir began to paint, we have grown familiar with what are called 'admirable' photographs of scenery and towns. If we press for a definition of what their admirers mean by the epithet, we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual picture of a familiar object, a picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us because it startles us, makes us emerge from our habits and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to us an earlier impression. For instance, one of these 'magnificent' photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will shew us some cathedral which we are accustomed to see in the middle of a town, taken instead from a selected point of view from which it will appear to be thirty times the height of the houses and to be thrusting a spur out from the bank of the river, from which it is actually a long way off. Now the effort made by Elstir to reproduce things not as he knew them to be but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed, had led him exactly to this point; he gave special emphasis to certain of these laws of perspective, which were thus all the more striking, since his art had been their first interpreter. A river, because of the windings of its course, a bay because of the apparent contact of the cliffs on either side of it, would look as though there had been hollowed out in the heart of the plain or of the mountains a lake absolutely landlocked on every side. In a picture of a view from Balbec painted upon a scorching day in summer an inlet of the sea appeared to be enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began farther out. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by the gulls which, wheeling over what, when one looked at the picture, seemed to be solid rock, were as a matter of fact inhaling the moist vapour of the shifting tide. Other laws were discernible in the same canvas, as, at the foot of immense cliffs, the lilliputian grace of white sails on the blue mirror on whose surface they looked like butterflies asleep, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallidity of the light. This play of light and shade, which also photography has rendered commonplace, had interested Elstir so much that at one time he had painted what were almost mirages, in which a castle crowned with a tower appeared as a perfect circle of castle prolonged by a tower at its summit, and at its foot by an inverted tower, whether because the exceptional purity of the atmosphere on a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brightness of the stone, or because the morning mists rendered the stone as vaporous as the shadow. And similarly, beyond the sea, behind a line of woods, began another sea roseate with the light of the setting sun, which was, in fact, the sky. The light, as it were precipitating new solids, thrust back the hull of the boat on which it fell behind the other hull that was still in shadow, and rearranged like the steps of a crystal staircase what was materially a plane surface, but was broken up by the play of light and shade upon the morning sea. A river running beneath the bridges of a town was caught from a certain point of view so that it appeared entirely dislocated, now broadened into a lake, now narrowed into a rivulet, broken elsewhere by the interruption of a hill crowned with trees among which the burgher would repair at evening to taste the refreshing breeze; and the rhythm of this disintegrated town was assured only by the inflexible uprightness of the steeples which did not rise but rather, following the plumb line of the pendulum marking its cadence as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense beneath them all the confused mass of houses that rose vaguely in the mist along the banks of the crushed, disjointed stream. And (since Elstir's earliest work belonged to the time in which a painter would make his landscape attractive by inserting a human figure), on the cliff's edge or among the mountains, the road, that half human part of nature, underwent, like river or ocean, the eclipses of perspective. And whether a sheer wall of mountain, or the mist blown from a torrent, or the sea prevented the eye from following the continuity of the path, visible to the traveller but not to us, the little human personage in old–fashioned attire seemed often to be stopped short on the edge of an abyss, the path which he had been following ending there, while, a thousand feet above him in those pine–forests, it was with a melting eye and comforted heart that we saw reappear the threadlike whiteness of its dusty surface, hospitable to the wayfaring foot, whereas from us the side of the mountain had hidden, where it turned to avoid waterfall or gully, the intervening bends.","Although it is said, and rightly so, that it is only in the sciences, and not in art, that there can be progress or discovery, and that no artist who launches into his own endeavour can ever be helped or hindered by the endeavours of any others, it must be recognized that, in so far as art establishes certain laws, and once an industry has vulgarized them, the art of earlier times loses in retrospect something of its originality. Since the earliest period of Elstir, we have seen supposedly ‘admirable’ photographs of landscapes and cities. If one tries to define what it is that art lovers mean by that adjective, it can generally be seen to apply to some unfamiliar image of a familiar thing, an image that is different from the ones we are in the habit of noticing, unusual yet true, and which for that reason seems doubly striking, since it surprises us and shakes us out of our habits, while at the same time it turns us in on ourselves by recalling an impression. For instance, one of these ‘magnificent’ photographs will illustrate a law of perspective by showing a cathedral which we are accustomed to seeing in the centre of the city, but taken from a point of view chosen so as to make it appear thirty times higher than the houses and jutting out beside the river, whereas it is nowhere near it. The fact was that Elstir’s intent, not to show things as he knew them to be, but in accordance with the optical illusions that our first sight of things is made of, had led him to isolate some of these laws of perspective, which were more striking in his day, art having been first to uncover them. A bend in the course of a river, or the apparent contiguity of the cliffs bounding a bay, seemed to make a lake, completely enclosed, in the middle of the plain or the mountains. In a painting done at Balbec on a stifling hot summer’s day, a recess of the coastline, held between walls of pink granite, appeared not to be the sea, which could be seen further off: the unbrokenness of the ocean was suggested only by seagulls wheeling above what looked like solid stone, but which for them was wind and wave. The same canvas defined other laws, such as the Lilliputian grace of white sails at the foot of the immense cliffs, set on the blue mirror like sleeping butterflies, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallor of the light. This play of shadows, which photography has also spread far and wide, had fascinated Elstir so much that at one point he had enjoyed painting veritable mirages, in which a château topped by a tower looked like a completely circular château with a tower growing out of the roof and another one, inverted, beneath it, either because the extraordinary purity of a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and glitter of stone, or because morning mists made the stone as insubstantial as shadow. Similarly, beyond the sea, behind a stretch of woodland, the sea began again, turned pink by the setting sun, but it was the sky. The sunlight, as though inventing new solids, struck the hull of a boat and pushed it back beyond another one lying in the shade; it laid the steps of a crystal staircase across the surface of the morning sea, which, though in fact smooth, was broken by the angle of illumination. A river flowing under the bridges of a city was shown from a point of view that split it, spread it into a lake, narrowed it to a trickle, or blocked it by planting a hill in it, covered with woods, where the city-dwellers like to go for a breath of evening air; and the rhythm of the disrupted city was marked only by the inflexible verticality of the steeples, which did not climb skywards, but seemed rather, like gravity’s plumb-line marking the beat in a triumphal march, to have the whole vague mass of houses hanging beneath them, ranged in misty tiers along the crushed and dismembered river. Even that semi-human part of nature, a footpath along a cliff-top or on a mountain-side (Elstir’s earliest works dating from the period when landscapes had to feature the presence of a character), was affected, like rivers or the ocean, by the eclipses of perspective. And whether a mountain ridge, a haze of spume rising from a waterfall, or the sea prevented one from seeing the road in its entirety, visible to the character but not to us, the little human figure in outdated clothes, lost among this wilderness, often seemed to have stopped in front of an abyss, the route he was following having come to an end; and then, three hundred yards higher up, among the pine-woods, we would be touched and reassured to see the reappearance of the thin white line of sandy path, friendly to the wanderer’s tread , the intervening turns and twists of which, disappearing round the gulf or the waterfall, had been hidden from us by a mountainside."
"Bien que les mérites spirituels d’un salon et son élégance soient généralement en rapports inverses plutôt que directs, il faut croire, puisque Swann trouvait Mme Bontemps agréable, que toute déchéance acceptée a pour conséquence de rendre les gens moins difficiles sur ceux avec qui ils sont résignés à se plaire, moins difficiles sur leur esprit comme sur le reste. Et si cela est vrai, les hommes doivent, comme les peuples, voir leur culture et même leur langage disparaître avec leur indépendance. Un des effets de cette indulgence est d’aggraver la tendance qu’à partir d’un certain âge on a à trouver agréables les paroles qui sont un hommage à notre propre tour d’esprit, à nos penchants, un encouragement à nous y livrer ; cet âge-là est celui où un grand artiste préfère à la société de génies originaux celle d’élèves qui n’ont en commun avec lui que la lettre de sa doctrine et par qui il est encensé, écouté ; où un homme ou une femme remarquables qui vivent pour un amour trouveront la plus intelligente dans une réunion la personne peut-être inférieure, mais dont une phrase aura montré qu’elle sait comprendre et approuver ce qu’est une existence vouée à la galanterie, et aura ainsi chatouillé agréablement la tendance voluptueuse de l’amant ou de la maîtresse ; c’était l’âge aussi où Swann, en tant qu’il était devenu le mari d’Odette, se plaisait à entendre dire à Mme Bontemps que c’est ridicule de ne recevoir que des duchesses (concluant de là, au contraire de ce qu’il eût fait jadis chez les Verdurin, que c’était une bonne femme, très spirituelle et qui n’était pas snob) et à lui raconter des histoires qui la faisaient « tordre », parce qu’elle ne les connaissait pas et que d’ailleurs elle « saisissait » vite, aimant à flatter et à s’amuser. « Alors le docteur ne raffole pas, comme vous, des fleurs, demandait Mme Swann à Mme Cottard. – Oh ! vous savez que mon mari est un sage ; il est modéré en toutes choses. Si, pourtant, il a une passion. » L’œil brillant de malveillance, de joie et de curiosité : « Laquelle, madame ? » demandait Mme Bontemps. Avec simplicité, Mme Cottard répondait : « La lecture. – Oh ! c’est une passion de tout repos chez un mari ! s’écriait Mme Bontemps en étouffant un rire satanique. – Quand le docteur est dans un livre, vous savez ! – Hé bien, madame, cela ne doit pas vous effrayer beaucoup… – Mais si !… pour sa vue. Je vais aller le retrouver, Odette, et je reviendrai au premier jour frapper à votre porte. À propos de vue, vous a-t-on dit que l’hôtel particulier que vient d’acheter Mme Verdurin sera éclairé à l’électricité ? Je ne le tiens pas de ma petite police particulière, mais d’une autre source : c’est l’électricien lui-même, Mildé, qui me l’a dit. Vous voyez que je cite mes auteurs ! Jusqu’aux chambres qui auront leurs lampes électriques avec un abat-jour qui tamisera la lumière. C’est évidemment un luxe charmant. D’ailleurs nos contemporaines veulent absolument du nouveau, n’en fût-il plus au monde. Il y a la belle-sœur d’une de mes amies qui a le téléphone posé chez elle ! Elle peut faire une commande à un fournisseur sans sortir de son appartement ! J’avoue que j’ai platement intrigué pour avoir la permission de venir un jour parler devant l’appareil. Cela me tente beaucoup, mais plutôt chez une amie que chez moi. Il me semble que je n’aimerais pas avoir le téléphone à domicile. Le premier amusement passé, cela doit être un vrai casse-tête. Allons, Odette, je me sauve, ne retenez plus Mme Bontemps puisqu’elle se charge de moi, il faut absolument que je m’arrache, vous me faites faire du joli, je vais être rentrée après mon mari ! »","Although the spiritual merits of a salon and its elegance are generally inversely related rather than directly related, it must be believed, since Swann found Madame Bontemps agreeable, that any decline accepted has the effect of making people less difficult about those with whom they are resigned to pleasing themselves, less difficult on their minds as on the rest. And if this is true, men must, like peoples, see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency that, from a certain age, we have to find pleasant the words which are a tribute to our own turn of mind, to our inclinations, an encouragement to indulge in them. ; that age is when a great artist prefers to the society of original geniuses that of pupils who have in common with him only the letter of his doctrine and by whom he is praised, listened to; where a remarkable man or woman who lives for a love will find the most intelligent in a meeting the person who may be inferior, but whose one sentence will have shown that she knows how to understand and approve of what a life dedicated to gallantry is, and will thus have pleasantly tickled the voluptuous tendency of the lover or mistress; it was also the age when Swann, as he had become Odette's husband, liked to hear Madame Bontemps say that it was ridiculous to receive only duchesses (concluding from this, on the contrary to what he would have done long ago with the Verdurins, that she was a good woman, very witty and not a snob) and to tell her stories that made her ""twist"" because she did not know them. and which, moreover, she ""seized"" quickly, loving to flatter and amuse herself. ""Then the doctor isn't as fond of flowers as you are,"" Madame Swann asked Madame Cottard. - Oh ! you know that my husband is a sage; he is moderate in all things. If, however, he has a passion. Eyes shining with malevolence, joy and curiosity: “Which one, madam?” asked Madame Bontemps. With simplicity, Mrs. Cottard replied: “Reading. - Oh ! it is a passion of all rest in a husband! exclaimed Madame Bontemps, stifling a satanic laugh. – When the doctor is in a book, you know! – Well, Madame, that shouldn't frighten you very much… – But it does!… for his eyesight. I'll go find him, Odette, and I'll come back the first day knocking at your door. Speaking of views, have you been told that the mansion Madame Verdurin has just bought will be lit by electricity? I don't get it from my little private police, but from another source: the electrician himself, Mildé, told me. You see that I quote my authors! Up to the rooms which will have their electric lamps with a lampshade which will filter the light. This is obviously a charming luxury. Moreover, our contemporaries absolutely want something new, even if it is no longer in the world. There is the sister-in-law of one of my friends who has the phone at home! She can place an order with a supplier without leaving her apartment! I admit that I flatly intrigued to have permission to come and speak in front of the device one day. It tempts me a lot, but rather at a friend's house than at my house. It seems to me that I would not like to have the telephone at home. The first fun passed, it must be a real headache. Come on, Odette, I'm running away, don't hold back Madame Bontemps any longer since she's taking care of me, I absolutely must tear myself away, you're making me look pretty, I'll be home after my husband! »","Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one's house but duchesses (concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins', that she was a good creature, extremely sensible and not at all a snob) and telling her stories which made her 'die laughing' because she had not heard them before, although she always 'saw the point' at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. ""Then the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?"" Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. "" Oh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; he practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion. "" Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, "" And what is that, pray?"" inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, ""Reading."" ""Oh, that's a very restful passion in a husband!"" cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. ""When the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!"" ""Well, that needn't alarm you much…"" ""But it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn't get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mildé, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming luxury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it's the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister–in–law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I've made the most bare–faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It's very tempting, but more in a friend's house than at home. I don't think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first excitement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you're not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she's looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you're making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!""","Although the wittiness of any salon and its degree of fashionableness usually stand in inverse rather than direct relation to each other, it must be assumed, given that Swann thought Mme Bontemps was a pleasant person, that any acceptance of one’s lowered status has its corollary in a relaxing of the standards one applies to the people whose company one is resigned to enjoy, whose wit one is prepared to find amusing. If that is so, then once the independence of individuals is threatened, their culture and even their language, like those of nations, must also stand in jeopardy. Beyond a certain age, one of the effects of this indulgence is to exacerbate our tendency to take pleasure in hearing praise of our own ways of thinking and preferences, which we see as an invitation to air them again; it is the age at which a great painter may find that the company of his creative peers begins to pall, when he prefers to mix with his pupils, whose only common point with him is their respect for the letter of his tenets, but who listen to him, who extol him; it is the age when, at a party, an outstanding man or woman, living only for some beloved, will be convinced, on hearing some possibly mediocre individual say something which, by suggesting a sympathetic understanding of the life devoted to amorous things, flatters their fond obsession, that they are listening to the only real mind among those present; it was the age at which Swann, in his capacity as husband of Odette, liked both to hear Mme Bontemps say how stupid it is to frequent only duchesses (from which he concluded she was a sensible woman, full of wit and without a touch of snobbery, the opposite of what he would have thought in earlier times at the Verdurins’) and to share jokes with her which ‘tickled her fancy’, because, though she had never heard any of them, she always ‘got’ them, being eager to please and ever ready to enjoy a good laugh. ‘ So, Mme Swann said to Mme Cottard, you tell me the Doctor isn’t a great flower-fancier like yourself? – Well, as you know, my husband is the soul of good sense – moderation in all things. Still, I must say, he does have one great passion. – And what’s that, dear lady?’ implored Mme Bontemps, her eyes gleaming with spite, glee and inquisitiveness. ‘Reading, Mme Cottard replied in her artless way. – Oh well! That’s a reassuring passion for a husband to have! Mme Bontemps exclaimed, stifling fiendish mirth. – Yes, just give him a good book! – Well, dear lady, there’s nothing much to be alarmed about in that. – Oh, but there is! His eyesight! Which reminds me, Odette, I really must be off now. But I’ll be back, knocking on your door, at the earliest opportunity. Speaking of eyesight, have you heard the house that Mme Verdurin has just bought is going to have the electric light in it? It wasn’t my little private police who told me, you know. It was Mildé the electrician himself! I like quoting my sources, as you can see. And even the bedrooms will have electric lamps, with shades on, to soften the light. Very nice, very luxurious! We belong to a generation of ladies for whom everything must be up to the minute, the very latest thing. The sister-in-law of a friend of mine has actually got a telephone installed in her house! She can order something from a shopkeeper without stepping out of her own front door! I must admit I’ve been shamelessly currying favour, so that I’ll be allowed to go and speak into the machine one day. The idea fascinates me – but only in someone else’s house, not in my own. I don’t think I’d like having a telephone about the house. Once the novelty of it wears off, it must be a definite nuisance. Now, Odette, I’m off! And you must also release Mme Bontemps, since she’s looking after me. I really must go! You’ll get me into hot water – Dr Cottard will be home before me!’"
"Faveur plus précieuse encore que de m’emmener avec eux au Jardin d’Acclimatation ou au concert, les Swann ne m’excluaient même pas de leur amitié avec Bergotte, laquelle avait été à l’origine du charme que je leur avais trouvé quand, avant même de connaître Gilberte, je pensais que son intimité avec le divin vieillard eût fait d’elle pour moi la plus passionnante des amies, si le dédain que je devais lui inspirer ne m’eût pas interdit l’espoir qu’elle m’emmenât jamais avec lui visiter les villes qu’il aimait. Or, un jour, Mme Swann m’invita à un grand déjeuner. Je ne savais pas quels devaient être les convives. En arrivant, je fus, dans le vestibule, déconcerté par un incident qui m’intimida. Mme Swann manquait rarement d’adopter les usages qui passent pour élégants pendant une saison et ne parvenant pas à se maintenir sont bientôt abandonnés (comme beaucoup d’années auparavant elle avait eu son « handsome cab », ou faisait imprimer sur une invitation à déjeuner que c’était « to meet » un personnage plus ou moins important). Souvent ces usages n’avaient rien de mystérieux et n’exigeaient pas d’initiation. C’est ainsi que, mince innovation de ces années-là et importée d’Angleterre, Odette avait fait faire à son mari des cartes où le nom de Charles Swann était précédé de « Mr ». Après la première visite que je lui avais faite, Mme Swann avait corné chez moi un de ces « cartons » comme elle disait. Jamais personne ne m’avait déposé de cartes ; je ressentis tant de fierté, d’émotion, de reconnaissance, que, réunissant tout ce que je possédais d’argent, je commandai une superbe corbeille de camélias et l’envoyai à Mme Swann. Je suppliai mon père d’aller mettre une carte chez elle, mais de s’en faire vite graver d’abord où son nom fût précédé de « Mr ». Il n’obéit à aucune de mes deux prières, j’en fus désespéré pendant quelques jours, et me demandai ensuite s’il n’avait pas eu raison. Mais l’usage du « Mr », s’il était inutile, était clair. Il n’en était pas ainsi d’un autre qui, le jour de ce déjeuner, me fut révélé, mais non pourvu de signification. Au moment où j’allais passer de l’antichambre dans le salon, le maître d’hôtel me remit une enveloppe mince et longue sur laquelle mon nom était écrit. Dans ma surprise, je le remerciai, cependant je regardais l’enveloppe. Je ne savais pas plus ce que j’en devais faire qu’un étranger d’un de ces petits instruments que l’on donne aux convives dans les dîners chinois. Je vis qu’elle était fermée, je craignis d’être indiscret en l’ouvrant tout de suite et je la mis dans ma poche d’un air entendu. Mme Swann m’avait écrit quelques jours auparavant de venir déjeuner « en petit comité ». Il y avait pourtant seize personnes, parmi lesquelles j’ignorais absolument que se trouvât Bergotte. Mme Swann qui venait de me « nommer » comme elle disait à plusieurs d’entre elles, tout à coup, à la suite de mon nom, de la même façon qu’elle venait de le dire (et comme si nous étions seulement deux invités du déjeuner qui devaient être chacun également contents de connaître l’autre), prononça le nom du doux Chantre aux cheveux blancs. Ce nom de Bergotte me fit tressauter comme le bruit d’un revolver qu’on aurait déchargé sur moi, mais instinctivement pour faire bonne contenance je saluai ; devant moi, comme ces prestidigitateurs qu’on aperçoit intacts et en redingote dans la poussière d’un coup de feu d’où s’envole une colombe, mon salut m’était rendu par un homme jeune, rude, petit, râblé et myope, à nez rouge en forme de coquille de colimaçon et à barbiche noire. J’étais mortellement triste, car ce qui venait d’être réduit en poudre, ce n’était pas seulement le langoureux vieillard, dont il ne restait plus rien, c’était aussi la beauté d’une œuvre immense que j’avais pu loger dans l’organisme défaillant et sacré que j’avais, comme un temple, construit expressément pour elle, mais à laquelle aucune place n’était réservée dans le corps trapu, rempli de vaisseaux, d’os, de ganglions, du petit homme à nez camus et à barbiche noire qui était devant moi. Tout le Bergotte que j’avais lentement et délicatement élaboré moi-même, goutte à goutte, comme une stalactite, avec la transparente beauté de ses livres, ce Bergotte-là se trouvait d’un seul coup ne plus pouvoir être d’aucun usage, du moment qu’il fallait conserver le nez en colimaçon et utiliser la barbiche noire ; comme n’est plus bonne à rien la solution que nous avions trouvée pour un problème dont nous avions lu incomplètement la donnée et sans tenir compte que le total devait faire un certain chiffre. Le nez et la barbiche étaient des éléments aussi inéluctables et d’autant plus gênants que, me forçant à réédifier entièrement le personnage de Bergotte, ils semblaient encore impliquer, produire, sécréter incessamment un certain genre d’esprit actif et satisfait de soi, ce qui n’était pas de jeu, car cet esprit-là n’avait rien à voir avec la sorte d’intelligence répandue dans ces livres, si bien connus de moi et que pénétrait une douce et divine sagesse. En partant d’eux, je ne serais jamais arrivé à ce nez en colimaçon ; mais en partant de ce nez qui n’avait pas l’air de s’en inquiéter, faisait cavalier seul et « fantaisie », j’allais dans une tout autre direction que l’œuvre de Bergotte, j’aboutirais, semblait-il, à quelque mentalité d’ingénieur pressé, de la sorte de ceux qui quand on les salue croient comme il faut de dire : « Merci et vous » avant qu’on leur ait demandé de leurs nouvelles, et si on leur déclare qu’on a été enchanté de faire leur connaissance, répondent par une abréviation qu’ils se figurent bien portée, intelligente et moderne en ce qu’elle évite de perdre en de vaines formules un temps précieux : « Également ». Sans doute, les noms sont des dessinateurs fantaisistes, nous donnant des gens et des pays des croquis si peu ressemblants que nous éprouvons souvent une sorte de stupeur quand nous avons devant nous, au lieu du monde imaginé, le monde visible (qui d’ailleurs n’est pas le monde vrai, nos sens ne possédant pas beaucoup plus le don de la ressemblance que l’imagination, si bien que les dessins enfin approximatifs qu’on peut obtenir de la réalité sont au moins aussi différents du monde vu que celui-ci l’était du monde imaginé). Mais pour Bergotte la gêne du nom préalable n’était rien auprès de celle que me causait l’œuvre connue, à laquelle j’étais obligé d’attacher, comme après un ballon, l’homme à barbiche sans savoir si elle garderait la force de s’élever. Il semblait bien pourtant que ce fût lui qui eût écrit les livres que j’avais tant aimés, car Mme Swann ayant cru devoir lui dire mon goût pour l’un d’eux, il ne montra nul étonnement qu’elle en eût fait part à lui plutôt qu’à un autre convive, et ne sembla pas voir là l’effet d’une méprise ; mais, emplissant la redingote qu’il avait mise en l’honneur de tous ces invités, d’un corps avide du déjeuner prochain, ayant son attention occupée d’autres réalités importantes, ce ne fut que comme à un épisode révolu de sa vie antérieure, et comme si on avait fait allusion à un costume du duc de Guise qu’il eût mis une certaine année à un bal costumé, qu’il sourit en se reportant à l’idée de ses livres, lesquels aussitôt déclinèrent pour moi (entraînant dans leur chute toute la valeur du Beau, de l’univers, de la vie), jusqu’à n’avoir été que quelque médiocre divertissement d’homme à barbiche. Je me disais qu’il avait dû s’y appliquer, mais que s’il avait vécu dans une île entourée par des bancs d’huîtres perlières, il se fût à la place livré avec succès au commerce des perles. Son œuvre ne me semblait plus aussi inévitable. Et alors je me demandais si l’originalité prouve vraiment que les grands écrivains soient des dieux régnant chacun dans un royaume qui n’est qu’à lui, ou bien s’il n’y a pas dans tout cela un peu de feinte, si les différences entre les œuvres ne seraient pas le résultat du travail, plutôt que l’expression d’une différence radicale d’essence entre les diverses personnalités.","An even more precious favor than taking me with them to the Jardin d'Acclimatation or to the concert, the Swanns did not even exclude me from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the origin of the charm I had found in them when, even before knowing Gilberte, I thought that her intimacy with the divine old man would have made her the most exciting of friends for me, if the disdain I was to inspire in her had not prevented me from hoping that she would love me. never take with him to visit the cities he loved. One day Madame Swann invited me to a big luncheon. I didn't know who the guests were to be. On arriving, I was disconcerted in the vestibule by an incident which intimidated me. Madame Swann seldom failed to adopt customs which pass for elegant during a season and failing to maintain themselves are soon abandoned (as many years before she had had her ""handsome cab"", or had printed on an invitation to lunch that it was ""to meet"" a more or less important character). Often these uses had nothing mysterious and did not require initiation. Thus, a slight innovation of those years and imported from England, Odette had her husband make cards on which the name of Charles Swann was preceded by ""Mr"". After my first visit to her, Madame Swann had taken one of those ""cards"" at my house, as she called it. No one had ever given me cards; I felt so much pride, emotion, and gratitude that, collecting all my money, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and sent it to Madame Swann. I begged my father to go and put a card at her house, but to have one engraved quickly first on which his name was preceded by ""Mr"". He didn't obey either of my prayers, I was desperate for a few days, and then wondered if he hadn't been right. But the use of the ""Mr"", if it was useless, was clear. It was not so with another which, on the day of this breakfast, was revealed to me, but not endowed with meaning. As I was about to pass from the antechamber into the salon, the butler handed me a thin, long envelope on which my name was written. In my surprise, I thanked him, however I looked at the envelope. I knew no more what to do with it than a stranger knows one of those little instruments given to guests at Chinese dinners. I saw that it was closed, I feared to be indiscreet by opening it immediately and I put it in my pocket with a knowing air. Madame Swann had written to me a few days earlier to come and have lunch ""in small groups"". There were, however, sixteen people, among whom I was absolutely unaware that Bergotte was. Madame Swann who had just ""named"" me as she said to several of them, suddenly, following my name, in the same way as she had just said (and as if we were only two guests who must have been equally happy to know the other), pronounced the name of the sweet, white-haired Cantor. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver being fired at me, but instinctively to put on a good face I bowed; before me, like those conjurers you see intact and in frock coats in the dust of a gunshot from which a dove takes flight, my salvation was returned to me by a young man, rough, short, stocky and short-sighted , with a red nose in the form of a snail shell and a black goatee. I was mortally sad, because what had just been reduced to powder was not only the languorous old man, of whom nothing remained, it was also the beauty of an immense work that I had been able to lodge in the failing and sacred organism that I had, like a temple, built expressly for her, but for which no place was reserved in the stocky body, filled with vessels, bones, ganglia, of the little man with a snub nose and a black goatee who was in front of me. All the Bergotte that I had slowly and delicately elaborated myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, with the transparent beauty of his books, this Bergotte suddenly found itself unable to be of any use. , as long as it was necessary to keep the spiral nose and use the black goatee; as the solution we had found for a problem of which we had read the data incompletely and without taking into account that the total had to make a certain figure is no longer good for anything. The nose and the goatee were elements so inescapable and all the more embarrassing that, forcing me to entirely re-build the character of Bergotte, they still seemed to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain kind of active and self-satisfied spirit, which which was no game, for that spirit had nothing to do with the kind of intelligence spread in those books, so well known to me and penetrated by a sweet and divine wisdom. Starting from them, I would never have arrived at this spiral nose; but starting from this nose which did not seem to worry about it, went it alone and ""fantasy"", I was going in a completely different direction than the work of Bergotte, I would end up, it seemed , to some mentality of an engineer in a hurry, of the kind who when they are greeted believe it is necessary to say: ""Thank you and you"" before they have been asked about them, and if they are told that we was delighted to meet them, respond with an abbreviation that they consider themselves well-bred, intelligent and modern in that it avoids wasting precious time in vain formulas: ""Also"". Undoubtedly, the names are fanciful sketches, giving us sketches of people and countries so unlike that we often feel a kind of amazement when we have before us, instead of the imagined world, the visible world (which incidentally is not the real world, our senses not possessing the gift of resemblance much more than imagination, so that the finally approximate drawings that we can obtain from reality are at least as different from the world seen as that it was from the imagined world). But for Bergotte the embarrassment of the preliminary name was nothing compared to that which caused me the known work, to which I was obliged to attach, as after a balloon, the man with a goatee without knowing if it would retain the strength to get up. It did seem, however, that it was he who had written the books I had loved so much, for Madame Swann having thought it necessary to tell him of my taste for one of them, he showed no astonishment that she had mentioned it. to him rather than to another guest, and did not seem to see there the effect of a mistake; but, filling the frock coat which he had put on in honor of all these guests, with a body eager for the next luncheon, having his attention occupied with other important realities, it was only as if at a bygone episode in his life. earlier, and as if an allusion had been made to a costume of the Duc de Guise that he had worn a certain year at a costume ball, that he smiled when referring to the idea of his books, which immediately declined for me ( carrying in their fall all the value of Beauty, of the universe, of life), until having been only some mediocre entertainment of a man with a goatee. I thought he must have applied himself to it, but if he had lived on an island surrounded by beds of pearl oysters, he would have successfully engaged in the pearl trade instead. His work no longer seemed so inevitable to me. And so I wondered if originality really proves that great writers are gods each reigning in a kingdom that is his only, or if there is not in all this a little pretence, if the differences between the works would not be the result of the work, rather than the expression of a radical difference of essence between the various personalities.","* * * A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, the Swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon–party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned (as, for instance, many years before, she had had her 'private hansom,' or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, 'To meet,' followed by the name of some more or less important personage). Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by ""Mr."". After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these 'pasteboards,' as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix ""Mr."". He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of ""Mr.,"" if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon–party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing–room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with 'just a few people.' There were, however, sixteen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already 'named' me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it (in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other), pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance's sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick–set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail–shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, expressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood–vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased (I could see at once) to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail–shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self–satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail–shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: "" Thanks, and you?"" before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up–to–date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: "" Same here! "" Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world (which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined). But in Bergotte's case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation (dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself), until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl–oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make–believe, whether the differences between one man's book and another's were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities.","An even greater boon than to be taken to the Zoo in the Bois, or to a concert, was to be included in the Swanns’ friendship with Bergotte, the thing which had been one of the sources of their charm, long before I came to know Gilberte, in the days when I had dreamed that to be friends with such a girl, who was a friend of the divine old man, would be a thrilling experience, if only the disdain which she must feel for me had not made it for ever futile for me to hope I might one day accompany them on their excursions to the towns he loved. Then one day Mme Swann sent me an invitation to a special luncheon. I did not know who the other guests were to be. And as I arrived, I was disconcerted and intimidated by a small incident which happened just inside the Swanns’ front door. Mme Swann rarely failed to adopt any of the short-lived customs which are supposed to be smart, which last for a season, then disappear – for instance, many years before, she had had her hansom cab,51 and had her dinner invitations printed with the English words to meet immediately preceding the name of some guest of any importance. Many of these customs were quite unmysterious, even to the uninitiated. Such a one at that time was a little fad imported from England, which led Odette to have her husband’s visiting-cards printed with the title of Mr before the name Charles Swann. After my very first visit to their house, Mme Swann had called on me and left one of these ‘pasteboards’, as she termed them. It was the first time in my life that anyone had ever left a card on me! I had been seized with such a fit of pride, excitement and gratitude that I scraped together all the money I possessed in the world, ordered a magnificent basket of camellias and had them sent to her. I also begged my father to go and leave a card on her, but to be sure first to get some with Mr in front of his name. He did neither of these things, which first plunged me into despair for a few days, then made me wonder whether he had not been right. Futile though it was, this fad for Mr was at least not misleading. However, the same could not be said for another one, which was revealed to me, without its meaning, on the day of Mme Swann’s special luncheon. Just as I was about to step from the ante-room into the drawing-room, the butler handed me a long, thin envelope on which my name was written. Such was my surprise that I thanked him, while I cast a glance at the envelope. I had no more notion of what I was supposed to do with it than a foreigner has about the purpose of the little implements given to guests at Chinese dinners. I could see it was sealed; so, rather than be thought indiscreet by opening it there and then, I slipped it into my pocket with a knowing air. The note Mme Swann had sent me a few days before had mentioned a lunch ‘for a select few’. Despite which, it was a party of sixteen; and I had no idea that among us was Bergotte. Mme Swann, who had just ‘named’ me, as she put it, to several of the guests, suddenly appended to my name, in exactly the same voice as she had used for pronouncing it, and as though he and I were merely two guests of hers who must be equally glad to make each other’s acquaintance, the name of my soft-voiced bard with the white hair. The name ‘Bergotte’ startled me as though it was a shot fired from a gun; but I was already bowing, going through the motions of polite behaviour. There in front of me, bowing back at me, like the conjuror in his tails emerging unscathed, while a dove flies up, from the smoke and dust of a detonation, I saw a stocky, coarse, thick-set, short-sighted man, quite young, with a red bottle-nose and a black goatee. I was heartbroken: it was not only that my gentle old man had just crumbled to dust and disappeared, it was also that for those things of beauty, his wonderful works, which I had once contrived to fit into that infirm and sacred frame, that dwelling I had lovingly constructed like a temple expressly designed to hold them, there was now no room in this thick-bodied little man standing in front of me, with all his blood-vessels, his bones, his glands, his snub nose and his little black beard. The whole Bergotte I had slowly and painstakingly constructed for myself, a drop at a time, like a stalactite, out of the limpid beauty of his books, had suddenly been rendered useless by the need to include the bottle-nose and the black goatee, just as our perfect solution to a mathematical problem turns out to be useless, because we have misread the terms of it and ignored the fact that the total should add up to a certain number. The presence of the nose and the beard loomed so large and were so bothersome that they not only forced me to rebuild from scratch the character of Bergotte, but also seemed to imply, to create, to be secreting non-stop a certain type of busy and self-satisfied mentality, all of which was quite unfair, as it was a mentality which had nothing in common with the type of mind that informed the books I knew so well, steeped in their mild and divine wisdom. Starting from the books, I could never have foreseen the bottle-nose; but starting from the nose – which looked quite unworried by all of this, and was rather full of itself, like a false nose – I was on a quite different course, which would never lead me to the works of Bergotte, it seemed, but towards the attitudes of some engineer who is always pressed for time, the kind of man who, when you greet him, thinks it is the thing to answer, ‘Fine, thanks, and yourself?’ though you haven’t asked him anything yet, who, when you say you are delighted to make his acquaintance, replies with an abbreviation he thinks is stylish, clever and up-to-the-minute, because it avoids wasting time in empty chat: ‘Likewise.’ Names are of course fanciful designers; the sketches they draw of people and places are such poor likenesses that we are often struck dumb when, instead of the world as we have imagined it, we are suddenly confronted by the world as we see it (which is not the real world, of course, as the senses are not much better at likenesses than the imagination; so we end up with approximate drawings of reality, which are at least as different from the seen world as the seen world was different from the imagined world). But with Bergotte, the embarrassment of the name, laden with its disconcerting preconceptions, was insignificant compared to the chagrin I felt at the prospect of tying this man with his goatee to the work I knew, as though to a balloon, and wondering whether it might still have the power to become airborne. However, it did appear that he was the man who had written the books I was so fond of, for when Mme Swann made a point of mentioning my liking for one of them , he did not appear taken aback that this had been said to him rather than to some other guest, and gave no hint of thinking there must be some misunderstanding: he just stood there, his body, which was looking forward to lunch, filling the frock-coat he had put on in honour of all these guests, his attention taken up by other important things, and gave a reminiscent smile, as though thinking back to some fleeting incident from former years, as though what had been mentioned was the hose and doublet of the Duc de Guise costume he had worn one year to a fancy-dress ball, rather than his books, which instantly collapsed (dragging down with themselves the whole point and glory of Beauty, of the universe, of life itself) and showed that they had never been anything but a trite pastime for a man with a little beard. It occurred to me that he must have put a great effort into this pastime, but also that, if he had lived on an island surrounded by oyster-banks, he would have engaged just as successfully in the buying and selling of pearls. His work no longer seemed as inevitable as before. I began to wonder whether originality really shows that great writers are gods, each of them reigning over a kingdom which is his alone, whether misleading appearances might not play a role in this, and whether the differences between their books might not be the result of hard work, rather than the expression of a radical difference in essence between distinct personalities."
"Je remerciai M. de Charlus avec émotion et lui dis que j’avais au contraire eu peur que ce que Saint-Loup lui avait dit de mon malaise à l’approche de la nuit, m’eût fait paraître à ses yeux plus stupide encore que je n’étais.","I thanked M. de Charlus with emotion and told him that I had, on the contrary, been afraid that what Saint-Loup had told him about my discomfort at the approach of night would have made me seem even more stupid to him. than I was.","I thanked M. de Charlus with some warmth and told him that, on the contrary, I had been afraid that what Saint–Loup had said to him about my discomfort when night came would have made me appear in his eyes more stupid even than I was. ""No; why?""",I thanked M. de Charlus with all the effusion at my command and told him that my fear had been that Saint-Loup’s words about my disquiet at nightfall might have made him think me more of a fool than I was.
"Aussi – de même que la diction de Bergotte eût sans doute charmé si lui-même n’avait été que quelque amateur récitant du prétendu Bergotte, au lieu qu’elle était liée à la pensée de Bergotte en travail et en action par des rapports vitaux que l’oreille ne dégageait pas immédiatement – de même c’était parce que Bergotte appliquait cette pensée avec précision à la réalité qui lui plaisait que son langage avait quelque chose de positif, de trop nourrissant, qui décevait ceux qui s’attendaient à l’entendre parler seulement de « l’éternel torrent des apparences » et des « mystérieux frissons de la beauté ». Enfin la qualité toujours rare et neuve de ce qu’il écrivait se traduisait dans sa conversation par une façon si subtile d’aborder une question, en négligeant tous ses aspects déjà connus, qu’il avait l’air de la prendre par un petit côté, d’être dans le faux, de faire du paradoxe, et qu’ainsi ses idées semblaient le plus souvent confuses, chacun appelant idées claires celles qui sont au même degré de confusion que les siennes propres. D’ailleurs toute nouveauté ayant pour condition l’élimination préalable du poncif auquel nous étions habitués et qui nous semblait la réalité même, toute conversation neuve, aussi bien que toute peinture, toute musique originale, paraîtra toujours alambiquée et fatigante. Elle repose sur des figures auxquelles nous ne sommes pas accoutumées, le causeur nous paraît ne parler que par métaphores, ce qui lasse et donne l’impression d’un manque de vérité. (Au fond les anciennes formes de langage avaient été elles aussi autrefois des images difficiles à suivre quand l’auditeur ne connaissait pas encore l’univers qu’elles peignaient. Mais depuis longtemps on se figure que c’était l’univers réel, on se repose sur lui.) Aussi quand Bergotte, ce qui semble pourtant bien simple aujourd’hui, disait de Cottard que c’était un ludion qui cherchait son équilibre, et de Brichot que « plus encore qu’à Mme Swann le soin de sa coiffure lui donnait de la peine parce que doublement préoccupé de son profil et de sa réputation, il fallait à tout moment que l’ordonnance de la chevelure lui donnât l’air à la fois d’un lion et d’un philosophe », on éprouvait vite de la fatigue et on eût voulu reprendre pied sur quelque chose de plus concret, disait-on pour signifier de plus habituel. Les paroles méconnaissables sorties du masque que j’avais sous les yeux, c’était bien à l’écrivain que j’admirais qu’il fallait les rapporter, elles n’auraient pas su s’insérer dans ses livres à la façon d’un puzzle qui s’encadre entre d’autres, elles étaient dans un autre plan et nécessitaient une transposition moyennant laquelle un jour que je me répétais des phrases que j’avais entendu dire à Bergotte, j’y retrouvai toute l’armature de son style écrit, dont je pus reconnaître et nommer les différentes pièces dans ce discours parlé qui m’avait paru si différent.","Also - just as Bergotte's diction would no doubt have charmed if he himself had been only some amateur reciter of the so-called Bergotte, instead it was linked to Bergotte's thought in work and in action by vital relations that the ear did not release immediately - likewise it was because Bergotte applied this thought with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had something positive, too nourishing, which disappointed those who expected it. to hear only of the ""eternal torrent of appearances"" and the ""mysterious thrills of beauty"". Finally, the always rare and new quality of what he wrote was reflected in his conversation by such a subtle way of approaching a question, neglecting all its already known aspects, that he seemed to take it by a little side, to be in the wrong, to make paradox, and that thus his ideas most often seemed confused, each one calling clear ideas those which are in the same degree of confusion as his own. Moreover, any novelty having as its condition the prior elimination of the cliché to which we were accustomed and which seemed to us to be reality itself, any new conversation, as well as any painting, any original music, will always seem convoluted and tiring. It is based on figures to which we are not accustomed, the speaker seems to us to speak only in metaphors, which is boring and gives the impression of a lack of truth. (Basically, the old forms of language had also once been images that were difficult to follow when the listener did not yet know the universe they painted. But for a long time we have imagined that it was the real universe, we rests on him.) Also when Bergotte, which nevertheless seems very simple today, said of Cottard that he was a ludion who was seeking his balance, and of Brichot that ""even more than Madame Swann the care of his hairstyle gave him trouble because doubly preoccupied with his profile and his reputation, it was necessary at all times that the order of the hair give him the air of both a lion and a philosopher"", one quickly experienced fatigue and one would have liked to regain a foothold on something more concrete, it was said to mean more habitual. The unrecognizable words coming out of the mask that I had under my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they had to be brought back, they would not have been able to fit into his books in the way of a puzzle which is framed among others, they were in another plane and required a transposition by means of which one day when I was repeating to myself sentences which I had heard Bergotte say, I found there all the framework of his written style, of which I was able to recognize and name the different parts in this spoken discourse which had seemed so different to me.","And so—just as Bergotte's way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish—so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over–rich, disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the 'eternal torrent of forms,' and of the 'mystic thrills of beauty.' Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in paradox, so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. (After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it.) So when Bergotte—and his figures appear simple enough to–day—said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that ""to him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,"" one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different.","Hence, just as the spoken manner of Bergotte might well have been pleasing if he had been some mere admirer quoting pseudo-Bergotte (whereas it was inseparable from the active workings of his mind, organically linked to it in ways which the ear did not pick up at once), so the reason why there was something too matter-of-fact and over-rich in his speech was because he applied that mind with precision to any aspect of reality which pleased him, thereby disappointing those who expected him to speak only of ‘the headlong torrent of fair forms’ and ‘Beauty’s thrilling enigma’. And then, his constant originality when he wrote became, when he spoke, a way of approaching topics that was so subtle in its avoidance of anything already familiar in them that it always sounded as though he was trying to come at it from some petty angle, taking it the wrong way on purpose, or being smart for smartness’s sake; and in this way, his ideas usually sounded confused, each of us having the habit of seeing clarity in ideas which show the same measure of confusion as our own. Besides, as anything new must first do away with the stereotype we are so used to that we have come to see it as reality itself, any new style of conversation, just like any originality in painting or music, will always seem convoluted and wearisome. We find its structuring figures so unwonted that the talker seems to be nothing more than a metaphor-monger, which fatigues the ear and hints at a lack of truthfulness. (Of course, the earlier speech-forms themselves were once images, which a listener unfamiliar with the world they described had difficulty in grasping. But they have long since come to be taken as the real world, the reliable world.) So, when one heard Bergotte say of Cottard that he was ‘a Cartesian devil forever trying to remain in equipoise’ – it seems such an unremarkable thing to say nowadays – or of Brichot that ‘He was even more concerned than Mme Swann with the care of his hair, because in his dual preoccupation with his profile and his reputation, the lie of his locks had to give him the constant appearance of being both a lion and a philosopher,’ one soon tired of it and wished for the firmer footing of something more concrete, by which one meant something one was more used to. The unrecognizable words emitted by the mask in front of me had to be attributed to the writer whom I admired, yet could not have been fitted like spare pieces of a jigsaw-puzzle into spaces in any of his books; they existed on a different plane, and required to be transposed in a way like the one I discovered on the day when, having repeated aloud some phrases which I had recently heard from Bergotte, I recognized in them the whole structure of his written style, which in spoken form had sounded so different that I had been unable to see and identify its component parts."
"Et certes dans le sentiment qui poussait une certaine actrice (plus connue d’ailleurs à cause de son élégance, de son esprit, de ses belles collections de porcelaine allemande que pour quelques rôles joués à l’Odéon), son amant, jeune homme très riche pour lequel elle s’était cultivée, et deux hommes très en vue de l’aristocratie, à faire dans la vie bande à part, à ne voyager qu’ensemble, à prendre à Balbec leur déjeuner, très tard, quand tout le monde avait fini, à passer la journée dans leur salon à jouer aux cartes, il n’entrait aucune malveillance, mais seulement les exigences du goût qu’ils avaient pour certaines formes spirituelles de conversation, pour certains raffinements de bonne chère, lequel leur faisait trouver plaisir à ne vivre, à ne prendre leurs repas qu’ensemble, et leur eût rendu insupportable la vie en commun avec des gens qui n’y avaient pas été initiés. Même devant une table servie, ou devant une table à jeu, chacun d’eux avait besoin de savoir que dans le convive ou le partenaire qui était assis en face de lui, reposaient en suspens et inutilisés un certain savoir qui permet de reconnaître la camelote dont tant de demeures parisiennes se parent comme d’un « moyen âge » ou d’une « Renaissance » authentiques et, en toutes choses, des critériums communs à eux pour distinguer le bon et le mauvais. Sans doute ce n’était plus, dans ces moments-là, que par quelque rare et drôle interjection jetée au milieu du silence du repas ou de la partie, ou par la robe charmante et nouvelle que la jeune actrice avait revêtue pour déjeuner ou faire un poker, que se manifestait l’existence spéciale dans laquelle ces amis voulaient partout rester plongés. Mais en les enveloppant ainsi d’habitudes qu’ils connaissaient à fond, elle suffisait à les protéger contre le mystère de la vie ambiante. Pendant de longs après-midi, la mer n’était suspendue en face d’eux que comme une toile d’une couleur agréable accrochée dans le boudoir d’un riche célibataire, et ce n’était que dans l’intervalle des coups qu’un des joueurs, n’ayant rien de mieux à faire, levait les yeux vers elle pour en tirer une indication sur le beau temps ou sur l’heure, et rappeler aux autres que le goûter attendait. Et le soir ils ne dînaient pas à l’hôtel où les sources électriques faisant sourdre à flots la lumière dans la grande salle à manger, celle-ci devenait comme un immense et merveilleux aquarium devant la paroi de verre duquel la population ouvrière de Balbec, les pêcheurs et aussi les familles de petits bourgeois, invisibles dans l’ombre, s’écrasaient au vitrage pour apercevoir, lentement balancée dans des remous d’or, la vie luxueuse de ces gens, aussi extraordinaire pour les pauvres que celle de poissons et de mollusques étranges (une grande question sociale, de savoir si la paroi de verre protègera toujours le festin des bêtes merveilleuses et si les gens obscurs qui regardent avidement dans la nuit ne viendront pas les cueillir dans leur aquarium et les manger). En attendant, peut-être parmi la foule arrêtée et confondue dans la nuit, y avait-il quelque écrivain, quelque amateur d’ichtyologie humaine, qui, regardant les mâchoires de vieux monstres féminins se refermer sur un morceau de nourriture engloutie, se complaisait à classer ceux-ci par race, par caractères innés et aussi par ces caractères acquis qui font qu’une vieille dame serbe dont l’appendice buccal est d’un grand poisson de mer, parce que depuis son enfance elle vit dans les eaux douces du faubourg Saint-Germain, mange la salade comme une La Rochefoucauld.","And certainly in the feeling that drove a certain actress (better known moreover because of her elegance, her wit, her beautiful collections of German porcelain than for a few roles played at the Odeon), her lover, a very rich for whom she had grown up, and two very prominent men of the aristocracy, to live in a band apart, to travel only together, to take their lunch at Balbec, very late, when everyone had finished, spending the day in their living room playing cards, there was no malevolence, but only the requirements of the taste they had for certain spiritual forms of conversation, for certain refinements of good food, which made them find pleasure in living, in taking their meals only together, and would have made life in common with people who had not been initiated into it unbearable. Even in front of a served table, or in front of a card table, each of them needed to know that in the guest or the partner who was seated in front of him, there lay suspended and unused a certain knowledge which makes it possible to recognize the junk. with which so many Parisian residences are adorned as an authentic ""Middle Ages"" or ""Renaissance"" and, in all things, criteria common to them to distinguish the good from the bad. Doubtless it was no longer, at such moments, except by some rare and funny interjection thrown in the middle of the silence of the meal or the party, or by the charming and new dress which the young actress had put on for lunch or a poker, which manifested the special existence in which these friends everywhere wanted to remain immersed. But by enveloping them thus in habits which they knew thoroughly, it sufficed to protect them against the mystery of the surrounding life. For long afternoons the sea hung in front of them only like a pleasingly colored canvas hung in the boudoir of a wealthy bachelor, and it was only between strokes that One of the players, having nothing better to do, looked up at her to get an indication of the fine weather or the time, and remind the others that the snack was waiting. And in the evening they did not dine at the hotel where the electric sources making the light well up in the large dining room, this one became like an immense and marvelous aquarium in front of the glass wall of which the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the families of the petty bourgeois, invisible in the shadows, crushed themselves against the glazing to see, slowly swaying in golden swirls, the luxurious life of these people, as extraordinary for the poor as that of fish and strange molluscs (a big social question, whether the glass wall will still shield the feast from wondrous beasts and whether the obscure people who stare hungrily in the night will not come and pluck them from their aquarium and eat them). In the meantime, perhaps among the crowd stopped and confused in the night, there was some writer, some amateur of human ichthyology, who, watching the jaws of old female monsters close on a piece of swallowed food, took pleasure in to classify these by race, by innate characteristics and also by those acquired characteristics which make an old Serbian lady whose mouth appendage is of a large sea fish, because since her childhood she has lived in fresh waters from the Faubourg Saint-Germain, eat the salad like a La Rochefoucauld.","And certainly into the feeling which impelled a young actress (better known, though, for her smart clothes, her smart sayings, her collection of German porcelain, than in the occasional parts that she had played at the Odéon), her lover, an immensely rich young man for whose sake she had acquired her culture, and two sprigs of aristocracy at that time much in the public eye to form a little band apart, to travel only together, to come down to luncheon—when at Balbec— very late, after everyone had finished; to spend the whole day in their sitting–room playing cards, there entered no sort of ill–humour against the rest of us but simply the requirements of the taste that they had formed for a certain type of conversation, for certain refinements of good living, which made them find pleasure in spending their time, in taking their meals only by themselves, and would have rendered intolerable a life in common with people who had not been initiated into those mysteries. Even at a dinner or a card table, each of them had to be certain that, in the diner or partner who sat opposite to him, there was, latent and not yet made use of, a certain brand of knowledge which would enable him to identify the rubbish with which so many houses in Paris were littered as genuine mediaeval or renaissance 'pieces' and, whatever the subject of discussion, to apply the critical standards common to all their party whereby they distinguished good work from bad. Probably it was only—at such moments—by some infrequent, amusing interruption flung into the general silence of meal or game, or by the new and charming frock which the young actress had put on for luncheon or for poker, that the special kind of existence in which these four friends desired, above all things, to remain plunged was made apparent. But by engulfing them thus in a system of habits which they knew by heart it sufficed to protect them from the mystery of the life that was going on all round them. All the long afternoon, the sea was suspended there before their eyes only as a canvas of attractive colouring might hang on the wall of a wealthy bachelor's flat and it was only in the intervals between the 'hands' that one of the players, finding nothing better to do, raised his eyes to it to seek from it some indication of the weather or the time, and to remind the others that tea was ready. And at night they did not dine in the hotel, where, hidden springs of electricity flooding the great dining–room with light, it became as it were an immense and wonderful aquarium against whose wall of glass the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the tradesmen's families, clustering invisibly in the outer darkness, pressed their faces to watch, gently floating upon the golden eddies within, the luxurious life of its occupants, a thing as extraordinary to the poor as the life of strange fishes or molluscs (an important social question, this: whether the wall of glass will always protect the wonderful creatures at their feasting, whether the obscure folk who watch them hungrily out of the night will not break in some day to gather them from their aquarium and devour them). Meanwhile there may have been, perhaps, among the gazing crowd, a motionless, formless mass there in the dark, some writer, some student of human ichthyology who, as he watched the jaws of old feminine monstrosities close over a mouthful of food which they proceeded then to absorb, was amusing himself by classifying them according to their race, by their innate characteristics as well as by those acquired characteristics which bring it about that an old Serbian lady whose buccal protuberance is that of a great sea–fish, because from her earliest years she has moved in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint–Germain, eats her salad for all the world like a La Rochefoucauld.","There were other people (a certain actress, really better known for her elegance, her wit and her collection of fine Dresden than for the few parts she had had at the Odéon; her lover, a very wealthy young man, for whose sake she had acquired her cultured tastes; and a pair of very visible aristocrats) whose preference for no company other than their own – they only ever travelled as a group, lunched while at Balbec very late, long after everyone else, then spent their days over cards in their private drawing-room – was motivated not by ill-will towards others but only by the requirements of the pleasure they took in a certain conversational bantering and in certain refined tastes in food and wines, which meant they could only enjoy things together, even meal-times, and would have found it unbearable to spend their time with other people uninitiated into their preferences. Even when sitting at a dinner-table or a gambling-table, each of them needed to be sure that, in their fellow-guest or partner at cards, there reposed in a suspended and latent form a certain shared knowledge enabling one to detect the fake furniture which in so many Parisian households passes for genuine Medieval or Renaissance and, in general, a common set of criteria for discriminating between the good and the bad. At such moments, the special element in which they wished to have their being could show only in an occasional witticism proffered amid the silence of the dinner-party or the game, or in a charming new dress which the young actress had put on specially for lunch-time, or because they were going to play poker. But this element, by enveloping them in habits which were second nature to them, was enough to keep at bay the mysteries of life about them. Throughout the long afternoons, the sea hung before their eyes like a mere canvas of a pleasing shade on the wall of a well-to-do bachelor’s sitting-room; and it was only between hands that one of the players, for lack of anything better to do, would glance out at it for a glimpse of a fine day or a clue to what time it might be, then remind the others that it was just on tea-time. In the evenings, they never dined in the hotel, where the electric fountains gushed their light into the spacious dining-room, turning it into an immense and wonderful aquarium, while, invisible in the outer shadows beyond the glass wall, the working classes of Balbec, the fishermen and even middle-class families pressed against the windows, in an attempt to see the luxurious life of these denizens, glowing amid the golden sway of the eddies, all of it as weird and fascinating for the poor as the existence of strange fish and molluscs (but whether the glass barrier will go on protecting for ever the feeding of the marvellous creatures, or whether the obscure onlookers gloating towards them from the outer dark will break into their aquarium and hook them for the pot, therein lies a great social question). In the meantime, perhaps among the nameless clusters in the night there may have been a writer, a fancier of human ichthyology who, at the spectacle of the closing jaws of old female monsters gulping down a bite of food, could enjoy classifying them by species, by innate characteristics, but also by the acquired characteristics which may mean that an old Serbian lady with a great ocean fish’s mouth-parts eats her lettuce – because since childhood she has swum in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint-Germain – like a La Rochefoucauld."
"D’ailleurs, j’aurais eu beau parler à Gilberte, elle ne m’aurait pas entendu. Nous nous imaginons toujours, quand nous parlons, que ce sont nos oreilles, notre esprit qui écoutent. Mes paroles ne seraient parvenues à Gilberte que déviées, comme si elles avaient eu à traverser le rideau mouvant d’une cataracte avant d’arriver à mon amie, méconnaissables, rendant un son ridicule, n’ayant plus aucune espèce de sens. La vérité qu’on met dans les mots ne se fraye pas son chemin directement, n’est pas douée d’une évidence irrésistible. Il faut qu’assez de temps passe pour qu’une vérité de même ordre ait pu se former en eux. Alors l’adversaire politique qui, malgré tous les raisonnements et toutes les preuves, tenait le sectateur de la doctrine opposée pour un traître, partage lui-même la conviction détestée à laquelle celui qui cherchait inutilement à la répandre ne tient plus. Alors, le chef-d’œuvre qui pour les admirateurs qui le lisaient haut semblait montrer en soi les preuves de son excellence et n’offrait à ceux qui écoutaient qu’une image insane ou médiocre, sera par eux proclamé chef-d’œuvre trop tard pour que l’auteur puisse l’apprendre. Pareillement en amour les barrières, quoi qu’on fasse, ne peuvent être brisées du dehors par celui qu’elles désespèrent ; et c’est quand il ne se souciera plus d’elles que, tout à coup, par l’effet du travail venu d’un autre côté, accompli à l’intérieur de celle qui n’aimait pas, ces barrières, attaquées jadis sans succès, tomberont sans utilité. Si j’étais venu annoncer à Gilberte mon indifférence future et le moyen de la prévenir, elle aurait induit de cette démarche que mon amour pour elle, le besoin que j’avais d’elle, étaient encore plus grands qu’elle n’avait cru, et son ennui de me voir en eût été augmenté. Et il est bien vrai, du reste, que c’est cet amour qui m’aidait, par les états d’esprit disparates qu’il faisait se succéder en moi, à prévoir, mieux qu’elle, la fin de cet amour. Pourtant, un tel avertissement, je l’eusse peut-être adressé, par lettre ou de vive voix, à Gilberte, quand assez de temps eût passé, me la rendant ainsi, il est vrai, moins indispensable, mais aussi ayant pu lui prouver qu’elle ne me l’était pas. Malheureusement, certaines personnes bien ou mal intentionnées lui parlèrent de moi d’une façon qui dut lui laisser croire qu’elles le faisaient à ma prière. Chaque fois que j’appris ainsi que Cottard, ma mère elle-même, et jusqu’à M. de Norpois avaient, par de maladroites paroles, rendu inutile tout le sacrifice que je venais d’accomplir, gâché tout le résultat de ma réserve en me donnant faussement l’air d’en être sorti, j’avais un double ennui. D’abord je ne pouvais plus faire dater que de ce jour-là ma pénible et fructueuse abstention que les fâcheux avaient à mon insu interrompue et, par conséquent, annihilée. Mais, de plus, j’eusse eu moins de plaisir à voir Gilberte qui me croyait maintenant non plus dignement résigné, mais manœuvrant dans l’ombre pour une entrevue qu’elle avait dédaigné d’accorder. Je maudissais ces vains bavardages de gens qui souvent, sans même l’intention de nuire ou de rendre service, pour rien, pour parler, quelquefois parce que nous n’avons pas pu nous empêcher de le faire devant eux et qu’ils sont indiscrets (comme nous), nous causent, à point nommé, tant de mal. Il est vrai que dans la funeste besogne accomplie pour la destruction de notre amour, ils sont loin de jouer un rôle égal à deux personnes qui ont pour habitude, l’une par excès de bonté et l’autre de méchanceté, de tout défaire au moment que tout allait s’arranger. Mais ces deux personnes-là, nous ne leur en voulons pas comme aux inopportuns Cottard, car la dernière, c’est la personne que nous aimons, et la première, c’est nous-même.","Besides, in vain had I spoken to Gilberte, she would not have heard me. We always imagine, when we speak, that it is our ears, our mind that is listening. My words would only have reached Gilberte deflected, as if they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a cataract before reaching my friend, unrecognizable, sounding ridiculous, no longer having any kind of meaning. The truth that we put into words does not make its way directly, is not endowed with irresistible evidence. Enough time must pass for a truth of the same order to have formed in them. Then the political adversary who, in spite of all the reasoning and all the proofs, held the follower of the opposite doctrine to be a traitor, himself shares the hated conviction to which the one who sought uselessly to spread it no longer holds. Then, the masterpiece which for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to show in itself the proofs of its excellence and offered only an insane or mediocre image to those who listened, will be proclaimed by them a masterpiece. too late for the author to find out. Similarly in love the barriers, whatever one does, cannot be broken from without by the one whom they despair; and it is when he no longer cares about them that, suddenly, through the effect of the work coming from another side, accomplished inside the one who did not love, these barriers, attacked long ago unsuccessful, will fall useless. If I had come to announce to Gilberte my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have inferred from this step that my love for her, the need I had for her, were even greater than she had. believed, and his annoyance at seeing me would have been increased. And it is quite true, moreover, that it was this love which helped me, by the disparate states of mind which it caused to follow one another in me, to foresee, better than her, the end of this love. However, such a warning, I would perhaps have addressed, by letter or in person, to Gilberte, when enough time had passed, thus rendering her to me, it is true, less indispensable, but also having been able to prove to her that she was not to me. Unfortunately, some good or bad people spoke to him about me in a way that must have led him to believe that they were doing so at my request. Each time that I thus learned that Cottard, my mother herself, and even M. de Norpois had, by clumsy words, rendered useless all the sacrifice I had just made, spoiled all the result of my by falsely giving myself the appearance of having come out of it, I had a double annoyance. First of all, I could only date from that day my painful and fruitful abstention, which the unfortunates had unwittingly interrupted and, consequently, annihilated. But, moreover, I would have had less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who now thought me no longer worthily resigned, but maneuvering in the shadows for an interview which she had disdained to grant. I cursed the idle chatter of people who often, without even the intention of harming or helping, for nothing, to talk, sometimes because we couldn't help doing it in front of them and they are indiscreet (like us), cause us, just in time, so much harm. It is true that in the disastrous work accomplished for the destruction of our love, they are far from playing an equal role to two people who have the habit, one by excess of kindness and the other of wickedness, of undoing everything in the when everything was going to be okay. But these two people, we do not blame them like the inopportune Cottards, because the last is the person we love, and the first is ourselves.","Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one's words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature which for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self–evident the proofs of its excellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons—of good or evil intent—spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill–chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking's sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet (as we ourselves are), do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself.","Even if I had spoken to Gilberte, she would not have heard me. We always fancy, when we speak, that it is our ears and our minds which listen. If any words of mine had reached Gilberte, they would have been distorted, as though by passing through the mobile curtain of a waterfall, and would have been unintelligible to her, full of ludicrous sounds and devoid of meaning. Whatever truth one puts into words does not make its way unaided; it is not endowed with irresistible self-evidence. In order for a truth of the same order to take form within them, a certain time must elapse. When it has elapsed, the proponent of a political idea who, in the teeth of all counter-arguments and proofs, once said the proponent of the opposite idea was a blackguard, comes at length to share the abhorrent belief, which has been abandoned in the meantime by the man who once wasted his breath on spreading it. The masterpiece which, to the ears of the admirers who read it aloud, sounded pregnant with the proofs of inherent excellence, while to those of listeners it was inept or nondescript, comes eventually to be pronounced a masterpiece indeed by the latter, but too late for its creator to know of it. So it is with the barriers of love, which the efforts, however despairing, of the one who is excluded by them can do nothing to force; then a day comes when, as a result of quite extraneous influences at work inside the feelings of the once unloving woman, and though he no longer cares about them, the barriers give way suddenly, but to no purpose. So even if I had gone to warn Gilberte about my future indifference to her, if I had told her how she might obviate it, she would just have deduced from this that my love for her, my need for her, were even greater than she had thought; and she would have been more irked than ever by the sight of me. It is a fact, too, that it was this love for her which, because of the sequence of discordant states of mind it created in me, helped me to foresee better than she how it would end. Nevertheless, I might still have sent or spoken such a warning to her after enough time had passed, which, though it would of course have meant she was by then not quite as necessary to me, would also have enabled me to demonstrate to her how unnecessary she was. But then unfortunately some well-meaning or ill-intentioned people would speak to her about me in ways which could only give her the impression that I had asked them to do so. Whenever I heard that Dr Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois, had with a few ill-advised words undone the sacrifice which I had so laboriously achieved, spoiling the whole effect of my silence towards Gilberte, by making it appear as though I had decided to end it, I was faced with a double difficulty. For one thing, my painful and profitable self-denial, which these meddlers had, unknown to me, just interrupted, and thus nullified, would have to be seen now as counting only from the day when they had spoken to her. What was worse was that I myself would have taken less pleasure in seeing her again, since she would have believed, not that I was living in a state of dignified resignation, but that I was intriguing behind her back to bring about a meeting which she had declined. I cursed the idle talk of people who for no particular reason, not even trying to hurt or please, often just for the sake of something to say, or because we have actually indulged in similar idle talk with them, turn out to be as indiscreet as we were, and harm us with a word out of place. However, in the sorry work done to cause the downfall of our love, the contribution of these people is not nearly as important as that of two others, who are in the habit of spoiling it at the very moment when its course promised to run smooth, one of them by being too kind, the other too unkind. Even so, we do not resent this pair as we do the meddling Cottards, as the second of them is the person we love and the first is ourself."
"Je me demandais si les jeunes filles que je venais de voir habitaient Balbec et qui elles pouvaient être. Quand le désir est ainsi orienté vers une petite tribu humaine qu’il sélectionne, tout ce qui peut se rattacher à elle devient motif d’émotion, puis de rêverie. J’avais entendu une dame dire sur la digue : « C’est une amie de la petite Simonet » avec l’air de précision avantageuse de quelqu’un qui explique : « C’est le camarade inséparable du petit La Rochefoucauld. » Et aussitôt on avait senti sur la figure de la personne à qui on apprenait cela une curiosité de mieux regarder la personne favorisée qui était « amie de la petite Simonet ». Un privilège assurément qui ne paraissait pas donné à tout le monde. Car l’aristocratie est une chose relative. Et il y a des petits trous pas cher où le fils d’un marchand de meubles est prince des élégances et règne sur une cour comme un jeune prince de Galles. J’ai souvent cherché depuis à me rappeler comment avait résonné pour moi, sur la plage, ce nom de Simonet, encore incertain alors dans sa forme que j’avais mal distinguée, et aussi quant à sa signification, à la désignation par lui de telle personne, ou peut-être de telle autre ; en somme empreint de ce vague et de cette nouveauté si émouvants pour nous dans la suite, quand ce nom, dont les lettres sont à chaque seconde plus profondément gravées en nous par notre attention incessante, est devenu (ce qui ne devait arriver pour moi, à l’égard de la petite Simonet, que quelques années plus tard) le premier vocable que nous retrouvions, soit au moment du réveil, soit après un évanouissement, même avant la notion de l’heure qu’il est, du lieu où nous sommes, presque avant le mot « je », comme si l’être qu’il nomme était plus nous que nous-même, et comme si après quelques moments d’inconscience, la trêve qui expire avant toute autre est celle pendant laquelle on ne pensait pas à lui. Je ne sais pourquoi je me dis dès le premier jour que le nom de Simonet devait être celui d’une des jeunes filles ; je ne cessai plus de me demander comment je pourrais connaître la famille Simonet ; et cela par des gens qu’elle jugeât supérieurs à elle-même, ce qui ne devait pas être difficile si ce n’étaient que de petites grues du peuple, pour qu’elle ne pût avoir une idée dédaigneuse de moi. Car on ne peut avoir de connaissance parfaite, on ne peut pratiquer l’absorption complète de qui vous dédaigne, tant qu’on n’a pas vaincu ce dédain. Or, chaque fois que l’image de femmes si différentes pénètre en nous, à moins que l’oubli ou la concurrence d’autres images ne l’élimine, nous n’avons de repos que nous n’ayons converti ces étrangères en quelque chose qui soit pareil à nous, notre âme étant à cet égard douée du même genre de réaction et d’activité que notre organisme physique, lequel ne peut tolérer l’immixtion dans son sein d’un corps étranger sans qu’il s’exerce aussitôt à digérer et assimiler l’intrus ; la petite Simonet devait être la plus jolie de toutes – celle, d’ailleurs, qui, me semblait-il, aurait pu devenir ma maîtresse, car elle était la seule qui à deux ou trois reprises, détournant à demi la tête, avait paru prendre conscience de mon fixe regard. Je demandai au lift s’il ne connaissait pas à Balbec des Simonet. N’aimant pas à dire qu’il ignorait quelque chose il répondit qu’il lui semblait avoir entendu causer de ce nom-là. Arrivé au dernier étage, je le priai de me faire apporter les dernières listes d’étrangers.","I wondered if the young girls I had just seen lived in Balbec and who they might be. When desire is thus directed towards a small human tribe that it selects, everything that can be attached to it becomes a reason for emotion, then for daydreaming. I had heard a lady say on the dyke: ""She's a friend of little Simonet,"" with the air of advantageous precision of someone who explains: ""He's the inseparable comrade of little La Rochefoucauld."" And immediately one sensed on the face of the person to whom this was being told a curiosity to take a better look at the favored person who was ""little Simonet's friend."" A privilege certainly that did not seem given to everyone. For aristocracy is a relative thing. And there are cheap little holes where the son of a furniture dealer is a prince of elegance and reigns over a court like a young Prince of Wales. I have often tried since then to remember how the name of Simonet had resonated for me on the beach, still uncertain then in its form which I had badly distinguished, and also as to its meaning, to the designation by him of such person, or perhaps of such another; in short imprinted with this vagueness and this novelty so moving for us in the sequel, when this name, whose letters are more deeply engraved in us every second by our incessant attention, became (which was not to happen for me, with regard to little Simonet, only a few years later) the first word that we find, either when waking up, or after fainting, even before the notion of what time it is, of the place where we are, almost before the word ""I"", as if the being he names were more us than ourselves, and as if after a few moments of unconsciousness, the truce that expires before any other is the one during which we do not didn't think of him. I don't know why I told myself from the first day that Simonet's name must have been that of one of the young girls; I kept asking myself how I could get to know the Simonet family; and that by people whom she judged superior to herself, which should not have been difficult if they were only little cranes of the people, so that she could not have a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have perfect knowledge, one cannot practice the complete absorption of whoever disdains you, until one has conquered this disdain. Now, each time the image of women so different penetrates us, unless oblivion or the competition of other images eliminates it, we have no rest until we have converted these strangers into some thing which is similar to us, our soul being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot tolerate the intrusion into its bosom of a foreign body without its exertion. immediately to digest and assimilate the intruder; little Simonet must have been the prettiest of them all – the one, moreover, who, it seemed to me, could have become my mistress, for she was the only one who on two or three occasions, half turning her head away, had seemed become aware of my fixed gaze. I asked the lift if he didn't know any Simonets at Balbec. Not liking to say that he did not know something, he answered that he seemed to have heard talk of that name. When I reached the top floor, I begged him to have the latest lists of foreigners brought to me.","I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the 'front': ""She is a friend of the little Simonet girl"" with that self–important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: ""He is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld."" And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was 'a friend of the little Simonet.' A privilege, obviously, that did not appear to be granted to all the world. For aristocracy is a relative state. And there are plenty of inexpensive little holes and corners where the son of an upholsterer is the arbiter of fashion and reigns over a court like any young Prince of Wales. I have often since then sought to recall how it first sounded for me there on the beach, that name of Simonet, still quite indefinite as to its form, which I had failed to distinguish, and also as to its significance, to the designation by it of such and such a person, or perhaps of some one else; imprinted, in fact, with that vagueness, that novelty which we find so moving in the sequel, when the name whose letters are every moment engraved more deeply on our hearts by our incessant thought of them has become (though this was not to happen to me with the name of the 'little Simonet' until several years had passed) the first coherent sound that comes to our lips, whether on waking from sleep or on recovering from a swoon, even before the idea of what o'clock it is or of where we are, almost before the word 'I,' as though the person whom it names were more 'we' even than we ourselves, and as though after a brief spell of unconsciousness the phase that is the first of all to dissolve is that in which we were not thinking of her. I do not know why I said to myself from the first that the name Simonet must be that of one of the band of girls; from that moment I never ceased to ask myself how I could get to know the Simonet family, get to know them, moreover, through people whom they considered superior to themselves (which ought not to be difficult if the girls were only common little 'bounders') so that they might not form a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have a perfect knowledge, one cannot effect the complete absorption of a person who disdains one, so long as one has not overcome her disdain. And since, whenever the idea of women who are so different from us penetrates our senses, unless we are able to forget it or the competition of other ideas eliminates it , we know no rest until we have converted those aliens into something that is compatible with ourself, our heart being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot abide the infusion of any foreign body into its veins without at once striving to digest and assimilate it: the little Simonet must be the prettiest of them all—she who, I felt moreover, might yet become my mistress, for she was the only one who, two or three times half–turning her head, had appeared to take cognisance of my fixed stare. I asked the lift–boy whether he knew of any people at Balbec called Simonet. Not liking to admit that there was anything which he did not know, he replied that he seemed to have heard the name somewhere. As we reached the highest landing I told him to have the latest lists of visitors sent up to me.","I wondered whether the girls I had seen lived in Balbec and who they might be. When the focus of our desire singles out a tiny human tribe, whatever may bear upon them in any way sets off an emotion in us, which then becomes a wondering day-dream. On the esplanade I had overheard a lady say, ‘Yes, she’s one of the friends of the Simonet girl,’ with the smug, superior knowledge of the person in the know who says, ‘Yes, he’s very thick with the young Duc de La Rochefoucauld.’ I was instantly aware of a look of curiosity on the face of the person being told this, a quickened interest in somebody who was so favoured as to be ‘one of the friends of the Simonet girl’. It was clear this was a privilege not open to all and sundry. Aristocracy is relative: there are all sorts of inexpensive little resorts where the son of a furniture salesman may be the arbiter of all things elegant, holding court like a young Prince of Wales. Since that moment when I first heard the name ‘Simonet’, I have often tried over the years to remember how it must have sounded there on the esplanade, in my uncertainty about its shape, which I had not quite noticed, about its meaning and the identity of this or that person to whom it might belong: full of the imprecision and foreignness which we later find so moving, when our unremitting attention to this name, with its letters more deeply imprinted in us with each passing second, has turned it (as the name of ‘the Simonet girl’ was to be turned for me, but not until several years later) into the first word to come to consciousness, whether on waking each morning or after fainting, even before any inkling of the time of day, or where we are, almost before the word ‘I’ itself, as though the one it names were more us than we are ourselves, as though the first respite always to end after a few moments’ oblivion were the respite of not thinking of it. Why I decided, there and then, that the name ‘Simonet’ must belong to one of the gang of girls I have no idea: how to get to know the Simonet family became my constant preoccupation, and especially how to be introduced to them by people they would see as above themselves – which should not prove difficult, if the girls were just vacuous and immoral specimens from the working classes – so that they could not look down on me: perfect knowledge of those who disdain you, like complete absorption of any such person, is impossible unless one has overcome that disdain. Every time we are assailed by images of women very different from ourself, unless these images are eliminated by being forgotten or overlaid by others, we can have no peace of mind until we have converted these strangers into something more like us, the self in that respect being similar in its action and reactions to the physical organism, which is incapable of accepting a foreign body within itself, without immediately setting to work to digest and assimilate the intruder. The Simonet girl must be the prettiest of them, and also, it seemed to me, the one who might be able to become my mistress, since she was the only one who, by turning slightly away two or three times, had appeared aware of my staring eyes. So I asked the ‘lift’ whether he knew of anyone in Balbec called Simonet. Being reluctant to admit to ignorance of anything, he replied that he thought he had ‘heard tell of some such a name’. When we reached the top floor, I asked him to have them send up the latest list of new-comers."
"Toute une autre partie des meubles, et surtout une magnifique argenterie ancienne de ma tante Léonie, je les vendis, malgré l’avis contraire de mes parents, pour pouvoir disposer de plus d’argent et envoyer plus de fleurs à Mme Swann qui me disait en recevant d’immenses corbeilles d’orchidées : « Si j’étais Monsieur votre père, je vous ferais donner un conseil judiciaire. » Comment pouvais-je supposer qu’un jour je pourrais regretter tout particulièrement cette argenterie et placer certains plaisirs plus haut que celui, qui deviendrait peut-être absolument nul, de faire des politesses aux parents de Gilberte. C’est de même en vue de Gilberte et pour ne pas la quitter que j’avais décidé de ne pas entrer dans les ambassades. Ce n’est jamais qu’à cause d’un état d’esprit qui n’est pas destiné à durer qu’on prend des résolutions définitives. J’imaginais à peine que cette substance étrange qui résidait en Gilberte et rayonnait en ses parents, en sa maison, me rendant indifférent à tout le reste, cette substance pourrait être libérée, émigrer dans un autre être. Vraiment la même substance, et pourtant devant avoir sur moi de tout autres effets. Car la même maladie évolue ; et un délicieux poison n’est plus toléré de même quand, avec les années, a diminué la résistance du cœur.","A whole other part of the furniture, and above all a magnificent old silverware from my aunt Léonie, I sold them, despite my parents' advice to the contrary, in order to be able to have more money and send more flowers to Mme Swann who told me when receiving huge baskets of orchids: ""If I were your father, I would have you given legal counsel."" How could I suppose that one day I could particularly regret this silverware and place certain pleasures higher than that, which would perhaps become absolutely useless, of paying courtesies to Gilberte's parents. It was also in view of Gilberte and in order not to leave her that I had decided not to enter embassies. It is only ever because of a state of mind that is not destined to last that we make definitive resolutions. I hardly imagined that this strange substance which resided in Gilberte and radiated in her parents, in her house, making me indifferent to everything else, this substance could be released, emigrate into another being. Really the same substance, and yet to have completely different effects on me. Because the same disease evolves; and a delicious poison is no longer tolerated even when, with the years, the resistance of the heart has diminished.","A whole lot more of my aunt Léonie's things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents' warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: ""If I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this. "" How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that (which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all) of bestowing favours upon Gilberte's parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart's power of resistance has diminished.","Another large lot of Aunt Léonie’s furniture, including especially a magnificent set of old silverware, I sold, against the express wishes of my parents, so as to have more money with which to send more flowers to Mme Swann. When she received my huge baskets of orchids, she would say, ‘Young man, if I was your father, I’d have your allowance stopped!’ But could I imagine that a day would come when I would regret having parted with that silver, a day when the greatest pleasure in my life, paying respects to Gilberte’s parents, would have become absolutely worthless? Similarly, it was because of Gilberte, so as not to part from her, that I had decided not to undertake a career as a diplomat. Our farthest-reaching resolutions are always made in a short-lived state of mind. I could barely conceive that the strange substance inhering in Gilberte, and radiating from her parents and the house where she lived, making me feel indifferent to everything else, could detach itself from her person and migrate into another. The very same substance, yet destined to have completely different effects on me. The same illness can evolve; and a sweet poison comes to be less tolerated, when with the years the heart’s resistance has weakened."
"Souvent nous rencontrions les sœurs de Bloch que j’étais obligé de saluer depuis que j’avais dîné chez leur père. Mes amies ne les connaissaient pas. « On ne me permet pas de jouer avec des Israélites », disait Albertine. La façon dont elle prononçait « issraêlite » au lieu d’« izraëlite » aurait suffi à indiquer, même si on n’avait pas entendu le commencement de la phrase, que ce n’était pas de sentiments de sympathie envers le peuple élu qu’étaient animées ces jeunes bourgeoises, de familles dévotes, et qui devaient croire aisément que les Juifs égorgeaient les enfants chrétiens. « Du reste, elles ont un sale genre, vos amies », me disait Andrée avec un sourire qui signifiait qu’elle savait bien que ce n’était pas mes amies. « Comme tout ce qui touche à la tribu », répondait Albertine sur le ton sentencieux d’une personne d’expérience. À vrai dire les sœurs de Bloch, à la fois trop habillées et à demi nues, l’air languissant, hardi, fastueux et souillon, ne produisaient pas une impression excellente. Et une de leurs cousines qui n’avait que quinze ans scandalisait le casino par l’admiration qu’elle affichait pour Mlle Léa, dont M. Bloch père prisait très fort le talent d’actrice, mais que son goût ne passait pas pour porter surtout du côté des messieurs.","We often met the Bloch sisters, whom I had been obliged to greet since I had dined with their father. My friends didn't know them. “I am not allowed to play with Israelites,” said Albertine. The way she pronounced ""Israelite"" instead of ""Izraelite"" would have been enough to indicate, even if we had not heard the beginning of the sentence, that it was not feelings of sympathy towards the chosen people that were animated by these young bourgeois, from devout families, who must have easily believed that the Jews cut the throats of Christian children. “Besides, your friends have a bad character,” Andrée told me with a smile that meant she knew very well that they weren’t my friends. “Like everything related to the tribe,” replied Albertine in the tone of a person of experience. To tell the truth, the Bloch sisters, at once overdressed and half-naked, looking languid, bold, ostentatious and filthy, did not produce an excellent impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen years old, scandalized the casino by the admiration she displayed for Mlle Léa, whose talent as an actress Mr. Bloch senior highly valued, but whose taste was not considered to be especially on the side of the gentlemen.","Often we encountered Bloch's sisters, to whom I was obliged to bow since I had dined with their father. My new friends did not know them. ""I am not allowed to play with Israelites,"" Albertine explained. Her way of pronouncing the word—'Issraelites' instead of 'Izraelites'—would in itself have sufficed to shew, even if one had not heard the rest of the sentence, that it was no feeling of friendliness towards the chosen race that inspired these young Frenchwomen, brought up in God–fearing homes, and quite ready to believe that the Jews were in the habit of massacring Christian children. ""Besides, they're shocking bad form, your friends,"" said Andrée with a smile which implied that she knew very well that they were no friends of mine. ""Like everything to do with the tribe,"" went on Albertine, in the sententious tone of one who spoke from personal experience. To tell the truth, Bloch's sisters, at once overdressed and half naked, with their languishing, bold, blatant , sluttish air did not create the best impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen, scandalised the Casino by her unconcealed admiration for Mlle. Lea, whose talent as an actress M. Bloch senior rated very high, but whose tastes were understood to lead her not exactly in the direction of the gentlemen.","We would often encounter Bloch’s sisters; and, since I had dined at their father’s table, I was obliged to greet them. My new friends did not know them. ‘I’m not allowed to be friends with children of Israel,’ Albertine said. Her way of pronouncing ‘Issrael’ rather than ‘Izrael’ would have been enough to let you know, even if you had not heard the beginning of her sentence, that the chosen people did not inspire warm feelings in the bosoms of these daughters of the middle class who, with their good Catholic upbringing, probably believed that Jews fed on the flesh of infant Christians. ‘ And anyway, there’s something quite unseemly about your girl-friends,’ said Andrée, with a smile which meant she knew perfectly well they were not my friends. ‘As there is about the whole tribe,’ added Albertine, in the worldly-wise tone of the woman of experience. The fact was that Bloch’s sisters, over-dressed but half-naked, managing to look both languid and brazen, resplendent and sluttish, did not create the best of impressions. And one of their cousins, a girl of no more than fifteen, shocked everyone at the Casino by her flagrant admiration for Mlle Léa, who, as an actress, was much to the taste of M. Bloch the elder, although her own tastes were reputed not to extend to gentlemen."
"Le médecin de Balbec appelé pour un accès de fièvre que j’avais eu, ayant estimé que je ne devrais pas rester toute la journée au bord de la mer, en plein soleil, par les grandes chaleurs, et rédigé à mon usage quelques ordonnances pharmaceutiques, ma grand’mère prit les ordonnances avec un respect apparent où je reconnus tout de suite sa ferme décision de n’en faire exécuter aucune, mais tint compte du conseil en matière d’hygiène et accepta l’offre de Mme de Villeparisis de nous faire faire quelques promenades en voiture. J’allais et venais, jusqu’à l’heure du déjeuner, de ma chambre à celle de ma grand’mère. Elle ne donnait pas directement sur la mer comme la mienne mais prenait jour de trois côtés différents : sur un coin de la digue, sur une cour et sur la campagne, et était meublée autrement avec des fauteuils brodés de filigranes métalliques et de fleurs roses d’où semblait émaner l’agréable et fraîche odeur qu’on trouvait en entrant. Et à cette heure où des rayons venus d’expositions, et comme d’heures différentes, brisaient les angles du mur, à côté d’un reflet de la plage mettaient sur la commode un reposoir diapré comme les fleurs du sentier, suspendaient à la paroi les ailes repliées, tremblantes et tièdes d’une clarté prête à reprendre son vol, chauffaient comme un bain un carré de tapis provincial devant la fenêtre de la courette que le soleil festonnait comme une vigne, ajoutaient au charme et à la complexité de la décoration mobilière en semblant exfolier la soie fleurie des fauteuils et détacher leur passementerie, cette chambre que je traversais un moment avant de m’habiller pour la promenade, avait l’air d’un prisme où se décomposaient les couleurs de la lumière du dehors, d’une ruche où les sucs de la journée que j’allais goûter étaient dissociés, épars, enivrants et visibles, d’un jardin de l’espérance qui se dissolvait en une palpitation de rayons d’argent et de pétales de rose. Mais avant tout j’avais ouvert mes rideaux dans l’impatience de savoir quelle était la Mer qui jouait ce matin-là au bord du rivage, comme une Néréide. Car chacune de ces Mers ne restait jamais plus d’un jour. Le lendemain il y en avait une autre qui parfois lui ressemblait. Mais je ne vis jamais deux fois la même.","The doctor from Balbec called for an attack of fever which I had had, having considered that I should not stay all day by the sea, in direct sunlight, in very hot weather, and wrote out some pharmaceutical prescriptions for my use. , my grandmother took the prescriptions with an apparent respect in which I immediately recognized her firm decision not to have any of them executed, but heeded the advice on hygiene and accepted Madame de Villeparisis's offer of us take a few car rides. I went back and forth, until lunchtime, from my room to my grandmother's. It did not directly overlook the sea like mine, but had daylight from three different sides: on a corner of the dyke, on a courtyard and on the countryside, and was furnished differently with armchairs embroidered with metallic filigrees and pink flowers of where seemed to emanate the pleasant and fresh smell that one found when entering. And at this hour when rays coming from exhibitions, and as if from different hours, broke the angles of the wall, beside a reflection of the beach placed on the chest of drawers a resting-place, variegated like the flowers of the path, suspended from the wall the folded wings, trembling and warm with a light ready to take flight again, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet in front of the window of the courtyard which the sun festooned like a vine, added to the charm and the complexity of the furnishing decoration seeming to exfoliate the floral silk of the armchairs and detach their trimmings, this room which I passed through for a moment before getting dressed for the walk, looked like a prism where the colors of the outside light were decomposing, of a beehive where the juices of the day that I was about to taste were dissociated, scattered, intoxicating and visible, of a garden of hope that dissolved in a throbbing of silver rays and rose petals. But above all I had opened my curtains in impatience to know what it was the Sea that was playing that morning on the edge of the shore, like a Nereid. For each of these Seas never remained more than a day. The next day there was another who sometimes looked like her. But I never experience the same thing twice.","THE Balbec doctor, who had been called in to cope with a sudden feverish attack, having given the opinion that I ought not to stay out all day on the beach, in the blazing sun, without shelter, and having written out various prescriptions for my use, my grandmother took his prescriptions with a show of respect in which I could at once discern her firm resolve not to have any of them 'made up,' but did pay attention to his advice on the matter of hygiene, and accepted an offer from Mme. de Villeparisis to take us for drives in her carriage. After this I would spend the mornings, until luncheon, going to and fro between my own room and my grandmother's. Hers did not look out directly upon the sea, as mine did, but was lighted from three of its four sides—with views of a strip of the 'front,' of a well inside the building, and of the country inland, and was furnished differently from mine, with armchairs upholstered in a metallic tissue with red flowers from which seemed to emanate the cool and pleasant odour that greeted me when I entered the room. And at that hour when the sun's rays, coming from different aspects and, as it were, from different hours of the day, broke the angles of the wall, thrust in a reflexion of the beach, made of the chest of drawers a festal altar, variegated as a bank of field–flowers, attached to the wall the wings, folded, quivering, warm, of a radiance that would, at any moment, resume its flight, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet before the window overlooking the well, which the sun festooned and patterned like a climbing vine, added to the charm and complexity of the room's furniture by seeming to pluck and scatter the petals of the silken flowers on the chairs, and to make their silver threads stand out from the fabric, this room in which I lingered for a moment before going to get ready for our drive suggested a prism in which the colours of the light that shone outside were broken up, or a hive in which the sweet juices of the day which I was about to taste were distilled, scattered, intoxicating, visible, a garden of hope which dissolved in a quivering haze of silver threads and rose leaves. But before all this I had drawn back my own curtains, impatient to know what Sea it was that was playing that morning by the shore, like a Nereid. For none of those Seas ever stayed with us longer than a day. On the morrow there would be another, which sometimes resembled its predecessor. But I never saw the same one twice.","The Balbec doctor, summoned to my bedside because of a bout of fever, having ruled that, while the very hot weather lasted, I ought not to sit about on the shore in the sun, wrote out some prescriptions, which my grandmother received from his hand with an appearance of respect in which I recognized at once her firm resolve to have none of them made up for me. She did, however, heed his advice about leading a healthier life and accepted Mme de Villeparisis’s offer to take us out and about in her carriage. Before lunch-time, I kept toing and froing between my room and my grandmother’s. Unlike mine, hers did not directly overlook the sea, although it had three different aspects: on a short stretch of the esplanade, a courtyard and the countryside. Its furnishings were also very different, including armchairs embroidered in filigree and embossed with pink flowers, which seemed to be the source of the fresh and pleasant smell one encountered on entering. At that late morning moment, when rays of sunlight came in from more than one aspect and seemingly from other times of day, breaking the angles of the walls, setting side by side on the chest of drawers a reflection from the beach and a wayside altar of colours as variegated as flowers along a lane, alighting brightly on the wainscot with the warm tremble of folded wings ready to fly away, warming like bath-water a country mat by the little courtyard window, which the sunshine festooned like a vine, adding to the charm and the decorative complexity of the furnishings by seeming to peel away the flowered silk of the armchairs and unpick their braidings, that room where I loitered for a moment before dressing for our outing was a prism in which the colours of the light from outside were dispersed, a hive in which all the heady nectars of the day awaiting me were still separate and ungathered but already visible, a garden of hopes shimmering with shafts of silver and rose petals. My very first act had been to open my curtains, in my impatience to see which sea was playing by the shore each morning like a Nereid. Whichever one it was, it was never there for more than a day. The following day, it would be replaced by another one, which at times resembled it; but I never saw the same one twice."
"Dès les premiers jours Saint-Loup fit la conquête de ma grand’mère, non seulement par la bonté incessante qu’il s’ingéniait à nous témoigner à tous deux, mais par le naturel qu’il y mettait comme en toutes choses. Or, le naturel – sans doute parce que, sous l’art de l’homme, il laisse sentir la nature – était la qualité que ma grand’mère préférait à toutes, tant dans les jardins où elle n’aimait pas qu’il y eût, comme dans celui de Combray, de plates-bandes trop régulières, qu’en cuisine où elle détestait ces « pièces montées » dans lesquelles on reconnaît à peine les aliments qui ont servi à les faire, ou dans l’interprétation pianistique qu’elle ne voulait pas trop fignolée, trop léchée, ayant même eu pour les notes accrochées, pour les fausses notes de Rubinstein, une complaisance particulière. Ce naturel, elle le goûtait jusque dans les vêtements de Saint-Loup, d’une élégance souple sans rien de « gommeux » ni de « compassé », sans raideur et sans empois. Elle prisait davantage encore ce jeune homme riche dans la façon négligente et libre qu’il avait de vivre dans le luxe sans « sentir l’argent », sans airs importants ; elle retrouvait même le charme de ce naturel dans l’incapacité que Saint-Loup avait gardée – et qui généralement disparaît avec l’enfance en même temps que certaines particularités physiologiques de cet âge – d’empêcher son visage de refléter une émotion. Quelque chose qu’il désirait par exemple et sur quoi il n’avait pas compté, ne fût-ce qu’un compliment, faisait se dégager en lui un plaisir si brusque, si brûlant, si volatile, si expansif, qu’il lui était impossible de le contenir et de le cacher ; une grimace de plaisir s’emparait irrésistiblement de son visage ; la peau trop fine de ses joues laissait transparaître une vive rougeur, ses yeux reflétaient la confusion et la joie ; et ma grand’mère était infiniment sensible à cette gracieuse apparence de franchise et d’innocence, laquelle d’ailleurs chez Saint-Loup, au moins à l’époque où je me liai avec lui, ne trompait pas. Mais j’ai connu un autre être, et il y en a beaucoup, chez lequel la sincérité physiologique de cet incarnat passager n’excluait nullement la duplicité morale ; bien souvent il prouve seulement la vivacité avec laquelle ressentent le plaisir, jusqu’à être désarmées devant lui et à être forcées de le confesser aux autres, des natures capables des plus viles fourberies. Mais où ma grand’mère adorait surtout le naturel de Saint-Loup, c’était dans sa façon d’avouer sans aucun détour la sympathie qu’il avait pour moi, et pour l’expression de laquelle il avait de ces mots comme elle n’eût pas pu en trouver elle-même, disait-elle, de plus justes et vraiment aimants, des mots qu’eussent contresignés « Sevigné et Beausergent » ; il ne se gênait pas pour plaisanter mes défauts – qu’il avait démêlés avec une finesse dont elle était amusée – mais comme elle-même aurait fait, avec tendresse, exaltant au contraire mes qualités avec une chaleur, un abandon qui ne connaissaient pas les réserves et la froideur grâce auxquelles les jeunes gens de son âge croient généralement se donner de l’importance. Et il montrait à prévenir mes moindres malaises, à remettre des couvertures sur mes jambes si le temps fraîchissait sans que je m’en fusse aperçu, à s’arranger sans le dire à rester le soir avec moi plus tard, s’il me sentait triste ou mal disposé, une vigilance que, du point de vue de ma santé pour laquelle plus d’endurcissement eût peut-être été préférable, ma grand’mère trouvait presque excessive, mais qui comme preuve d’affection pour moi la touchait profondément.","From the first days Saint-Loup conquered my grandmother, not only by the incessant kindness that he contrived to show us both, but by the naturalness that he showed in it as in all things. Now, the natural - no doubt because, under the art of man, it lets nature be felt - was the quality that my grandmother preferred to all, both in the gardens where she did not like it There were, as in that of Combray, flowerbeds that were too regular, only in the kitchen where she hated those ""pieces assembled"" in which one hardly recognizes the food which served to make them, or in the piano interpretation that She didn't want to be too polished, too licked, having even had a particular complaisance for the hung notes, for the false notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness, she tasted it even in the clothes of Saint-Loup, of a supple elegance without anything ""gummy"" or ""stuffy"", without stiffness and without starch. She prized this rich young man even more for the careless and free way he had of living in luxury without ""smelling money"", without airs of importance; she even found the charm of this naturalness in the inability that Saint-Loup had retained – and which generally disappears with childhood along with certain physiological peculiarities of this age – to prevent his face from reflecting an emotion. Something he wanted, for example, and on which he had not counted, even a compliment, released in him a pleasure so sudden, so burning, so volatile, so expansive, that it was impossible to contain and hide; a grimace of pleasure seized his face irresistibly; the excessively thin skin of her cheeks revealed a vivid blush, her eyes reflected confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely sensitive to this gracious appearance of frankness and innocence, which moreover in Saint-Loup, at least at the time when I became intimate with him, was not deceptive. But I knew another being, and there are many, in whom the physiological sincerity of this passing incarnate in no way excluded moral duplicity; very often it only proves the vivacity with which pleasure is felt, to the point of being disarmed before it and being forced to confess it to others, natures capable of the vilest deceits. But where my grandmother especially adored the naturalness of Saint-Loup, it was in his way of admitting without any detour the sympathy he had for me, and for the expression of which he had words like her. she herself could not have found, she said, more just and truly loving words countersigned by ""Sevigné and Beausergent""; he didn't hesitate to joke about my faults – which he had unraveled with a delicacy that amused her – but as she herself would have done, with tenderness, on the contrary exalting my qualities with a warmth, an abandon that knew no the reservations and the coldness thanks to which the young people of his age generally believe to make themselves important. And he showed how to prevent my slightest discomfort, to put the covers back on my legs if the weather cooled without my noticing it, to manage without saying so to stay with me later in the evening, if he felt sad or ill-disposed, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which more hardening would perhaps have been preferable, my grandmother found almost excessive, but which, as a proof of affection for me, touched her deeply.","From the first Saint–Loup made a conquest of my grandmother, not only by the incessant acts of kindness which he went out of his way to shew to us both, but by the naturalness which he put into them as into everything. For naturalness—doubtless because through the artifice of man it allows a feeling of nature to permeate—was the quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, where she did not like there to be, as there had been in our Combray garden, too formal borders, or at table, where she detested those dressed–up dishes in which you could hardly detect the foodstuffs that had gone to make them, or in piano–playing, which she did not like to be too finicking, too laboured, having indeed had a special weakness for the discords, the wrong notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness she found and enjoyed even in the clothes that Saint–Loup wore, of a pliant elegance, with nothing swagger, nothing formal about them, no stiffness or starch. She appreciated this rich young man still more highly for the free and careless way that he had of living in luxury without 'smelling of money,' without giving himself airs; she even discovered the charm of this naturalness in the incapacity which Saint–Loup had kept, though as a rule it is outgrown with childhood, at the same time as certain physiological peculiarities of that period, for preventing his face from at once reflecting every emotion. Something, for instance, that he wanted to have but had not expected, were it no more than a compliment, reacted in him in a burst of pleasure so quick, so burning, so volatile, so expansive that it was impossible for him to contain and to conceal it; a grin of delight seized irresistible hold of his face; the too delicate skin of his cheeks allowed a vivid glow to shine through them, his eyes sparkled with confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely touched by this charming show of innocence and frankness, which, incidentally, in Saint–Loup—at any rate at the period of our first friendship—was not misleading. But I have known another person, and there are many such, in whom the physiological sincerity of that fleeting blush in no way excluded moral duplicity; as often as not it proves nothing more than the vivacity with which pleasure is felt—so that it disarms them and they are forced publicly to confess it—by natures capable of the vilest treachery. But where my grandmother did really adore Saint–Loup's naturalness was in his way of admitting, without any evasion, his affection for me, to give expression to which he found words than which she herself, she told me, could not have thought of any more appropriate, more truly loving, words to which 'Sévigné and Beausergent' might have set their signatures. He was not afraid to make fun of my weaknesses—which he had discerned with an acuteness that made her smile—but as she herself would have done, lovingly, at the same time extolling my good qualities with a warmth, an impulsive freedom that shewed no sign of the reserve, the coldness by means of which young men of his age are apt to suppose that they give themselves importance. And he shewed in forestalling every discomfort, however slight, in covering my legs if the day had turned cold without my noticing it, in arranging (without telling me) to stay later with me in the evening if he thought that I was depressed or felt unwell, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which a more hardening discipline would perhaps have been better, my grandmother found almost excessive, though as a proof of his affection for myself she was deeply touched by it.","From the very first days of our acquaintance, Saint-Loup completely won over my grandmother, partly by the unfailing kindness with which he contrived to treat us, partly by the naturalness of the way he went about it, which was his way of going about everything. Naturalness, no doubt because it gives a glimpse, through human artistry, into nature itself, was the one quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, which she disliked if, like the garden at Combray, their plots and flowerbeds were too regular, in cookery, in which she abhorred fancy contraptions like wedding-cakes, with their barely recognizable ingredients, or in piano playing, which displeased her if it was too polished, too immaculate, a style to which she even preferred Rubinstein’s slight mistakes of fingering or wrong notes. She also found naturalness to enjoy in Saint-Loup’s clothes, which showed a soft elegance, as far from the ‘flashy’ as from the ‘prim and proper’, without stiffness or starch. Even more to her taste were the casual, easy ways of this rich young man, who managed to live among luxury without ‘smacking of money’, without giving himself airs; and the charm of his naturalness she saw too in something that Saint-Loup had never outgrown, though it generally disappears with the loss of childhood, along with some of childhood’s physiological characteristics: his inability to master his face, which revealed his every emotion. Taken by surprise, for example, by something he had wished for but not expected to receive, even just a compliment, he would be overcome by such a sudden gust of pleasure, so burning, so volatile, so expansive, that it was impossible for him to contain and conceal it; his features would set in an irresistible grimace of gratification; through the skin of his cheeks, of excessive fineness, there glowed a bright flush, and his eyes reflected embarrassment and joy; and my grandmother was greatly touched by this gracious show of candour and guilelessness, in which, at least in the days when I first came to know Saint-Loup, there was nothing misleading. I must say, though, that I have known another person, indeed there are many, in whom the physiological sincerity of the passing blush was entirely compatible with moral duplicity; in many such people, all it proves is that, for those who are capable of the direst treachery, there can be an intensity of enjoyment so disarming as to require immediate disclosure. But in nothing was the naturalness of Saint-Loup so endearing to my grandmother as in the open way he expressed his liking for me, in words which she herself, as she said, could never have bettered for their aptness and true devotion, words worthy of Mmes de Sévigné and de Beausergent; he made no bones about bantering me for my defects – the perspicacity with which he had surmised them had delighted her – but he did it in a way which was her own, with affection, and with a compensatory admiration for my qualities which was full of the warm spontaneity that eschews reserve and avoids disdain, the ways in which the self-importance of young men of his age usually likes to express itself. In anticipating my slightest indisposition, tucking my blankets round my legs at moments when I had not noticed the weather was turning cool, secretly arranging things so as to be able to stay late with me on evenings when he thought I was feeling doleful or not quite well, the care he took of my health, which might have required sterner measures, seemed all but excessive to my grandmother, though she was very touched by it as a token of his attachment to me."
"Cependant, mon père, pour aller au-devant des critiques que nous aurions pu faire sur notre invité, dit à maman :","However, my father, to forestall any criticisms we might have made of our guest, said to mum:","Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: ""Upon my word, old Norpois was rather 'typical,' as you call it, this evening, wasn't he?","My father, in an attempt to forestall any criticism we might have to make about his guest, said to my mother:"
"Je regardais les trois arbres, je les voyais bien, mais mon esprit sentait qu’ils recouvraient quelque chose sur quoi ils n’avaient pas prise, comme sur ces objets placés trop loin dont nos doigts allongés au bout de notre bras tendu effleurent seulement par instant l’enveloppe sans arriver à rien saisir. Alors on se repose un moment pour jeter le bras en avant d’un élan plus fort et tâcher d’atteindre plus loin. Mais pour que mon esprit pût ainsi se rassembler, prendre son élan, il m’eût fallu être seul. Que j’aurais voulu pouvoir m’écarter comme je faisais dans les promenades du côté de Guermantes quand je m’isolais de mes parents ! Il me semblait même que j’aurais dû le faire. Je reconnaissais ce genre de plaisir qui requiert, il est vrai, un certain travail de la pensée sur elle-même, mais à côté duquel les agréments de la nonchalance qui vous fait renoncer à lui, semblent bien médiocres. Ce plaisir, dont l’objet n’était que pressenti, que j’avais à créer moi-même, je ne l’éprouvais que de rares fois, mais à chacune d’elles il me semblait que les choses qui s’étaient passées dans l’intervalle n’avaient guère d’importance et qu’en m’attachant à la seule réalité je pourrais commencer enfin une vraie vie. Je mis un instant ma main devant mes yeux pour pouvoir les fermer sans que Mme de Villeparisis s’en aperçût. Je restai sans penser à rien, puis de ma pensée ramassée, ressaisie avec plus de force, je bondis plus avant dans la direction des arbres, ou plutôt dans cette direction intérieure au bout de laquelle je les voyais en moi-même. Je sentis de nouveau derrière eux le même objet connu mais vague et que je pus ramener à moi. Cependant tous trois, au fur et à mesure que la voiture avançait, je les voyais s’approcher. Où les avais-je déjà regardés ? Il n’y avait aucun lieu autour de Combray où une allée s’ouvrît ainsi. Le site qu’ils me rappelaient il n’y avait pas de place pour lui davantage dans la campagne allemande où j’étais allé une année avec ma grand’mère prendre les eaux. Fallait-il croire qu’ils venaient d’années déjà si lointaines de ma vie que le paysage qui les entourait avait été entièrement aboli dans ma mémoire et que, comme ces pages qu’on est tout d’un coup ému de retrouver dans un ouvrage qu’on s’imaginait n’avoir jamais lu, ils surnageaient seuls du livre oublié de ma première enfance. N’appartenaient-ils au contraire qu’à ces paysages du rêve, toujours les mêmes, du moins pour moi chez qui leur aspect étrange n’était que l’objectivation dans mon sommeil de l’effort que je faisais pendant la veille, soit pour atteindre le mystère dans un lieu derrière l’apparence duquel je le pressentais, comme cela m’était arrivé si souvent du côté de Guermantes, soit pour essayer de le réintroduire dans un lieu que j’avais désiré connaître et qui du jour où je l’avais connu m’avait paru tout superficiel, comme Balbec ? N’étaient-ils qu’une image toute nouvelle détachée d’un rêve de la nuit précédente, mais déjà si effacée qu’elle me semblait venir de beaucoup plus loin ? Ou bien ne les avais-je jamais vus et cachaient-ils derrière eux, comme tels arbres, telle touffe d’herbes que j’avais vus du côté de Guermantes, un sens aussi obscur, aussi difficile à saisir qu’un passé lointain, de sorte que, sollicité par eux d’approfondir une pensée, je croyais avoir à reconnaître un souvenir. Ou encore ne cachaient-ils même pas de pensées et était-ce une fatigue de ma vision qui me les faisait voir doubles dans le temps comme on voit quelquefois double dans l’espace ? Je ne savais. Cependant ils venaient vers moi ; peut-être apparition mythique, ronde de sorcières ou de nornes qui me proposait ses oracles. Je crus plutôt que c’étaient des fantômes du passé, de chers compagnons de mon enfance, des amis disparus qui invoquaient nos communs souvenirs. Comme des ombres ils semblaient me demander de les emmener avec moi, de les rendre à la vie. Dans leur gesticulation naïve et passionnée, je reconnaissais le regret impuissant d’un être aimé qui a perdu l’usage de la parole, sent qu’il ne pourra nous dire ce qu’il veut et que nous ne savons pas deviner. Bientôt à un croisement de routes, la voiture les abandonna. Elle m’entraînait loin de ce que je croyais seul vrai, de ce qui m’eût rendu vraiment heureux, elle ressemblait à ma vie.","I was looking at the three trees, I could see them clearly, but my mind felt that they were covering something over which they had no control, like those objects placed too far away which our fingers, stretched out at the end of our outstretched arm, brush only by moment the envelope without succeeding in grasping anything. So we rest for a moment to throw the arm forward with a stronger momentum and try to reach further. But for my mind to be able to gather together, to gain momentum, I would have had to be alone. How I would have liked to be able to move away as I did on the walks near Guermantes when I isolated myself from my parents! It even felt like I should have done it. I recognized this kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain work of the thought on itself, but compared to which the amenities of the nonchalance which makes you renounce it, seem very mediocre. This pleasure, the object of which was only foreseen, that I had to create myself, I experienced only a few times, but at each of them it seemed to me that the things that had happened in the meantime were of little importance and that by clinging to reality alone I could finally begin a real life. I put my hand in front of my eyes for a moment to be able to close them without Madame de Villeparisis noticing. I remained without thinking of anything, then with my collected thought, recaptured with more force, I leaped further in the direction of the trees, or rather in that interior direction at the end of which I saw them in myself. I felt again behind them the same known but vague object that I could bring back to me. However all three, as the car moved forward, I saw them approaching. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place around Combray where an alley thus opened. The site they reminded me of there was no place for it either in the German countryside where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was it necessary to believe that they came from years already so distant from my life that the landscape which surrounded them had been entirely obliterated in my memory and that, like those pages which one is suddenly moved to find in a a work that one imagined never having read, they floated alone from the forgotten book of my early childhood. On the contrary, did they belong only to these dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me, for whom their strange aspect was only the objectification in my sleep of the effort I was making during the vigil, or to reach the mystery in a place behind the appearance of which I had a presentiment of it, as it had happened to me so often near Guermantes, or to try to reintroduce it in a place that I had wanted to know and which from the day I had known him had seemed superficial to me, like Balbec? Were they just a brand new image detached from a dream of the previous night, but already so faded that it seemed to me to come from much further away? Or else had I never seen them and were they hiding behind them, like such trees, such tufts of grass that I had seen near Guermantes, a meaning as obscure, as difficult to grasp as a distant past, so that, solicited by them to deepen a thought, I thought I had to recognize a memory. Or were they not even hiding thoughts and was it a tiredness of my vision that made me see them double in time as one sometimes sees double in space? I did not know. However, they were coming towards me; perhaps a mythical apparition, round about witches or norns who offered me their oracles. I rather believed that they were ghosts from the past, dear companions of my childhood, departed friends who invoked our common memories. Like shadows they seemed to be asking me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their naive and passionate gesticulation, I recognized the helpless regret of a loved one who has lost the use of speech, feels that he will not be able to tell us what he wants and that we do not know how to guess. Soon at a crossroads, the car left them. She dragged me away from what I believed to be the only true, from what would have made me truly happy, she resembled my life.","I looked at the three trees; I could see them plainly, but my mind felt that they were concealing something which it had not grasped, as when things are placed out of our reach, so that our fingers, stretched out at arm's–length, can only touch for a moment their outer surface, and can take hold of nothing. Then we rest for a little while before thrusting out our arm with refreshed vigour, and trying to reach an inch or two farther. But if my mind was thus to collect itself, to gather strength, I should have to be alone. What would I not have given to be able to escape as I used to do on those walks along the Guermantes way, when I detached myself from my parents! It seemed indeed that I ought to do so now. I recognised that kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain effort on the part of the mind, but in comparison with which the attractions of the inertia which inclines us to renounce that pleasure seem very slight. That pleasure, the object of which I could but dimly feel, that pleasure which I must create for myself, I experienced only on rare occasions, but on each of these it seemed to me that the things which had happened in the interval were of but scant importance, and that in attaching myself to the reality of that pleasure alone I could at length begin to lead a new life. I laid my hand for a moment across my eyes, so as to be able to shut them without Mme. de Villeparisis's noticing. I sat there, thinking of nothing, then with my thoughts collected, compressed and strengthened I sprang farther forward in the direction of the trees, or rather in that inverse direction at the end of which I could see them growing within myself. I felt again behind them the same object, known to me and yet vague, which I could not bring nearer. And yet all three of them, as the carriage moved on, I could see coming towards me. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place near Combray where an avenue opened off the road like that. The site which they recalled to me, there was no room for it either in the scenery of the place in Germany where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was I to suppose, then, that they came from years already so remote in my life that the landscape which accompanied them had been entirely obliterated from my memory, and that, like the pages which, with sudden emotion, we recognise in a book which we imagined that we had never read, they surged up by themselves out of the forgotten chapter of my earliest infancy? Were they not rather to be numbered among those dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me in whom their unfamiliar aspect was but the objectivation in my dreams of the effort that I had been making while awake either to penetrate the mystery of a place beneath the outward appearance of which I was dimly conscious of there being something more, as had so often happened to me on the Guermantes way, or to succeed in bringing mystery back to a place which I had longed to know and which, from the day on which I had come to know it, had seemed to me to be wholly superficial, like Balbec? Or were they but an image freshly extracted from a dream of the night before, but already so worn, so altered that it seemed to me to come from somewhere far more distant? Or had I indeed never seen them before; did they conceal beneath their surface, like the trees, like the tufts of grass that I had seen beside the Guermantes way, a meaning as obscure, as hard to grasp as is a distant past, so that, whereas they are pleading with me that I would master a new idea , I imagined that I had to identify something in my memory? Or again were they concealing no hidden thought, and was it simply my strained vision that made me see them double in time as one occasionally sees things double in space? I could not tell. And yet all the time they were coming towards me; perhaps some fabulous apparition, a ring of witches or of norns who would propound their oracles to me. I chose rather to believe that they were phantoms of the past, dear companions of my childhood, vanished friends who recalled our common memories. Like ghosts they seemed to be appealing to me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their simple, passionate gesticulation I could discern the helpless anguish of a beloved person who has lost the power of speech, and feels that he will never be able to say to us what he wishes to say and we can never guess. Presently, at a cross–roads, the carriage left them. It was bearing me away from what alone I believed to be true , what would have made me truly happy; it was like my life.","I gazed at the three trees, which I could see quite clearly; but my mind suspected they hid something on which it could have no purchase, as our fingertips at the full stretch of our arm may from time to time barely touch but not quite grasp objects which lie just out of reach. So one rests for a moment before trying harder, with the arm outstretched, in the hope of catching hold at last. However, for my mind to be able to pause and summon up the effort required, I would have had to be unaccompanied. How I wished I could leave the others behind, as I used to along the Guermantes Way, wandering away from my parents! I even had the feeling that I ought to do so now. I could sense in this moment the presence of one of those pleasures which, though they require the mind to work upon itself, reduce to insipidity the sweets of the mental idleness which makes one prefer to abandon the effort. It was a pleasure which came to me seldom, and its object always lay beyond my mental scope, requiring me to create it myself; but on each occasion when it did come, I would have the feeling that all the things which had happened to me since the last time were more or less devoid of significance, and that, for my real life to begin at last, I must now attend to nothing but this unique reality. I put my hand briefly over my eyes, so as to be able to close them without Mme de Villeparisis noticing. I sat there for a moment thinking of nothing; then, with the fresher impetus of pent-up consciousness, I managed to leap further in the direction of the trees, or rather towards the inner part of me where I could see them. Once again I could detect, just behind them, the same familiar but imprecise object, which I could not quite take hold of. Meanwhile, as the carriage rolled on, I could see them coming nearer. Where had I set eyes on them before? In the countryside near Combray, there was no such place with an opening to a drive. Nor did the place they reminded me of fit anywhere into the countryside round a German spa where I had gone one year with my grandmother. Did this mean they belonged to years of my past life which were so distant that the landscape surrounding them had been utterly wiped out, and that, like those passages one recognizes with sudden excitement in a text one fancied one had never read, they were the only scrap left from the forgotten story-book of my early childhood? Or did they belong to one of those places one glimpses in dreams, always the same places, or so they were in my dreams, where their strange aspect was only sleep’s translation of the efforts I kept making while awake, either to see through the appearance of a place to a mystery which I sensed lay beyond it (which had so often happened along the Guermantes Way), or to restore mystery to a place which I had longed to see and which, once I had been there, had turned into something quite superficial, as Balbec had? Were they perhaps a very recent image, a small fragment from a dream of only the night before, but already so faded that it seemed to derive from much longer ago? Or perhaps I had never seen them anywhere; and though I thought they were a memory to be recalled, were they in fact only an invitation to comprehend an idea, concealing behind themselves, like certain trees or clumps of grass glimpsed along the Guermantes Way, a meaning which was every bit as obscure and ungraspable as a distant past? Or else, might it actually be that they concealed no idea at all, and that it was only an impairment of my eyesight, making me see double in time as one can see double in space? I could not tell. Still coming towards me, they might have been some mythological apparition, a coven of witches, a group of Norns propounding oracles. But I saw them as ghosts from my past, beloved companions from childhood, sometime friends reminding me of shared moments. Like risen shades, they seemed to be asking me to take them with me, to bring them back to the realm of the living. In their naïve and passionate gesticulations, I read the impotent regret of a loved one who, having lost the power of speech, knows that he will never be able to let us know what he wants, and that we can never deduce his meaning. Soon, at a crossroads, the carriage left them behind. Like my life itself, it was carrying me away from what seemed the only truth, from what would have made me truly happy."
"On voyait souvent passer depuis quelques jours, en pompeux équipage, grande, rousse, belle, avec un nez un peu fort, la princesse de Luxembourg, qui était en villégiature pour quelques semaines dans le pays. Sa calèche s’était arrêtée devant l’hôtel, un valet de pied était venu parler au directeur, était retourné à la voiture et avait rapporté des fruits merveilleux (qui unissaient dans une seule corbeille, comme la baie elle-même, diverses saisons), avec une carte : « La princesse de Luxembourg », où étaient écrits quelques mots au crayon. À quel voyageur princier demeurant ici incognito, pouvaient être destinés ces prunes glauques, lumineuses et sphériques comme était à ce moment-là la rotondité de la mer, ces raisins transparents suspendus au bois desséché comme une claire journée d’automne, ces poires d’un outremer céleste ? Car ce ne pouvait être à l’amie de ma grand’mère que la princesse avait voulu faire visite. Pourtant le lendemain soir Mme de Villeparisis nous envoya la grappe de raisins fraîche et dorée et des prunes et des poires que nous reconnûmes aussi, quoique les prunes eussent passé, comme la mer à l’heure de notre dîner, au mauve et que dans l’outremer des poires flottassent quelques formes de nuages roses. Quelques jours après nous rencontrâmes Mme de Villeparisis en sortant du concert symphonique qui se donnait le matin sur la plage. Persuadé que les œuvres que j’y entendais (le Prélude de Lohengrin, l’ouverture de Tannhauser, etc.) exprimaient les vérités les plus hautes, je tâchais de m’élever autant que je pouvais pour atteindre jusqu’à elles, je tirais de moi pour les comprendre, je leur remettais tout ce que je recélais alors de meilleur, de plus profond.","One often saw passing for a few days, in a pompous outfit, tall, red-haired, beautiful, with a rather large nose, the Princess of Luxembourg, who was on vacation for a few weeks in the country. His carriage had stopped in front of the hotel, a footman had come to speak to the manager, returned to the car and brought back marvelous fruits (which united in one basket, like the berry itself, various seasons) , with a card: “The Princess of Luxembourg”, on which were written a few words in pencil. To what princely traveler residing here incognito could those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as the roundness of the sea were at that moment, those transparent grapes hanging from the parched wood like a clear autumn day, those pears of a celestial ultramarine? For it could not have been my grandmother's friend that the princess had wanted to pay a visit to. However, the next evening Madame de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, fresh and golden, and some plums and pears which we also recognized, although the plums had turned, like the sea at our dinner hour, to mauve and in the Overseas pears floated a few pink cloud shapes. A few days later we met Madame de Villeparisis on leaving the symphony concert which was given in the morning on the beach. Convinced that the works I heard there (Lohengrin's Prelude, Tannhauser's overture, etc.) expressed the highest truths, I tried to rise as high as I could to reach them, I pulled of myself to understand them, I handed over to them all the best, most profound I concealed at the time.","We had several times, in the last few days, seen driving past us in a stately equipage, tall, auburn, handsome, with a rather prominent nose, the Princesse de Luxembourg, who was staying in the neighbourhood for a few weeks. Her carriage had stopped outside the hotel, a footman had come in and spoken to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had reappeared with the most amazing armful of fruit (which combined in a single basket, like the bay itself, different seasons) with a card: ""La Princesse de Luxembourg,"" on which were scrawled a few words in pencil. For what princely traveller sojourning here incognito, could they be intended, those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as was at that moment the circumfluent sea, transparent grapes clustering on a shrivelled stick, like a fine day in autumn, pears of a heavenly ultramarine? For it could not be on my grandmother's friend that the Princess had meant to pay a call. And yet on the following evening Mme. de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, cool, liquid, golden; plums too and pears which we remembered, though the plums had changed, like the sea at our dinner–hour, to a dull purple, and on the ultramarine surface of the pears there floated the forms of a few rosy clouds. A few days later we met Mme. de Villeparisis as we came away from the symphony concert that was given every morning on the beach. Convinced that the music to which I had been listening (the Prelude to Lohengrin, the Overture to Tannhäuser and suchlike) expressed the loftiest of truths, I was trying to elevate myself, as far as I could, so as to attain to a comprehension of them, I was extracting from myself so as to understand them, and was attributing to them, all that was best and most profound in my own nature at that time.","For some days past, a tall and beautiful woman with red hair and a rather prominent nose had been seen about in a very grand carriage: the Princess of Luxembourg, who had come down from town to spend a few weeks in the vicinity. Her barouche had drawn up outside the hotel, a footman had come in to talk to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had then carried in a magnificent basket of fruit which, like the Bay of Balbec itself, combined a range of seasons, as well as a card bearing the legend The Princess of Luxembourg and a few words added in pencil. Which princely traveller, living incognito in our hotel, was being sent such glaucous plums , their glowing roundness swelling to match the sea at that very moment, such translucent grapes hanging like a bright autumn day on their dried-up twig, pears of such celestial ultramarine? It was not possible that the person whom the Princess had been intending to visit was the old friend of my grandmother. And yet the following evening, Mme de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of cool golden grapes, with some plums and pears which we also recognized, although the plums, like the sea about dinner-time, had started to shade towards mauve, and the bluish surface of the pears now reflected patches of pink cloud. A few days later, we met Mme de Villeparisis at the end of the symphony concert given each morning down at the beach. I was convinced that the music I heard there (the prelude to Lohengrin, the overture to Tannhaüser, etc.) expressed the most exalted truths; and in my efforts to comprehend them I strove upwards , I yearned towards them, I drew the best out of my deepest self to offer up to them."
Nous nous taisions tous les deux. Nous n’osions pas nous regarder. Pourtant je souffrais plus de son angoisse que de la mienne. Aussi je m’approchai de la fenêtre et distinctement je lui dis en détournant les yeux :,"We were both silent. We didn't dare look at each other. Yet I suffered more from his anguish than from mine. So I approached the window and distinctly said to him, looking away:","We both remained silent. We dared not look one another in the face. And yet I was suffering more keenly from her anguish than from my own. And so I walked across to the window, and said to her, with a studied clearness of tone but with averted eyes:","A silence lengthened between us; we dared not catch each other’s eye. I was affected more by her distress than by my own. I stepped over to the window and, looking away from her, said quite clearly:"
"– Je crois que je peux en parler, car ils venaient chez mon père ; et comme disait M. Sainte-Beuve, qui avait bien de l’esprit, il faut croire sur eux ceux qui les ont vus de près et ont pu juger plus exactement de ce qu’ils valaient.","“I think I can talk about it, because they used to come to my father; and as M. Sainte-Beuve, who had a great deal of wit, said, one must believe in them those who have seen them up close and have been able to judge more exactly of their worth.","""I'm sure I have a right to speak, for they used to come to my father's house; and as M. Sainte–Beuve, who was a most intelligent man, used to say, in forming an estimate you must take the word of people who saw them close, and were able to judge more exactly of their real worth.""","‘You can take it from me. Because the fact is they were in and out of my father’s house. As M. Sainte-Beuve used to say, and he was a fine judge of wit, one should take the word of people who knew them at first hand and could size them up properly."
"– Oh ! moi, vous savez, disait-elle avec orgueil, je commence toujours par croire le mal. Je ne consens à admettre qu’une femme est vraiment mariée que quand on m’a sorti les extraits de naissance et les actes notariés. Du reste, n’ayez crainte, je vais procéder à ma petite enquête.","- Oh ! me, you know, she said proudly, I always begin by believing evil. I only agree to admit that a woman is really married when they have taken out the birth certificates and notarial deeds. Anyway, don't worry, I'm going to do my little investigation.","""Oh, well, you know,"" she explained with lofty condescension, ""I always begin by believing the worst. I will never admit that a woman is properly married until she has shewn me her birth certificate and her marriage lines. But there's no need to alarm yourselves; just wait till I've finished my little investigation.""","‘I make no apology, she said with pride, for believing the worst of people! I’m never convinced anyone’s an honest woman until I’ve set eyes on their birth certificate and their marriage lines. So I’ve got a few little inquiries to make – you mark my words.’"
"C’étaient, dominant la mer lointaine du haut de leur dune, ou s’accommodant déjà pour la nuit au pied de collines d’un vert cru et d’une forme désobligeante, comme celle du canapé d’une chambre d’hôtel où l’on vient d’arriver, composées de quelques villas que prolongeait un terrain de tennis et quelquefois un casino dont le drapeau claquait au vent fraîchissant, évidé et anxieux, de petites stations qui me montraient pour la première fois leurs hôtes habituels, mais me les montraient par leur dehors – des joueurs de tennis en casquettes blanches, le chef de gare vivant là, près de ses tamaris et de ses roses, une dame, coiffée d’un « canotier », qui, décrivant le tracé quotidien d’une vie que je ne connaîtrais jamais, rappelait son lévrier qui s’attardait, et rentrait dans son chalet où la lampe était déjà allumée – et qui blessaient cruellement de ces images étrangement usuelles et dédaigneusement familières mes regards inconnus et mon cœur dépaysé. Mais combien ma souffrance s’aggrava quand nous eûmes débarqué dans le hall du Grand-Hôtel de Balbec, en face de l’escalier monumental qui imitait le marbre, et pendant que ma grand’mère, sans souci d’accroître l’hostilité et le mépris des étrangers au milieu desquels nous allions vivre, discutait les « conditions » avec le directeur, sorte de poussah à la figure et à la voix pleines de cicatrices (qu’avait laissées l’extirpation sur l’une, de nombreux boutons, sur l’autre des divers accents dus à des origines lointaines et à une enfance cosmopolite), au smoking de mondain, au regard de psychologue, prenant généralement, à l’arrivée de l’« omnibus », les grands seigneurs pour des râleux et les rats d’hôtel pour des grands seigneurs. Oubliant sans doute que lui-même ne touchait pas cinq cent francs d’appointements mensuels, il méprisait profondément les personnes pour qui cinq cents francs ou plutôt comme il disait « vingt-cinq louis » est « une somme » et les considérait comme faisant partie d’une race de parias à qui n’était pas destiné le Grand-Hôtel. Il est vrai que, dans ce Palace même, il y avait des gens qui ne payaient pas très cher tout en étant estimés du directeur, à condition que celui-ci fût certain qu’ils regardaient à dépenser non pas par pauvreté mais par avarice. Elle ne saurait en effet rien ôter au prestige, puisqu’elle est un vice et peut par conséquent se rencontrer dans toutes les situations sociales. La situation sociale était la seule chose à laquelle le directeur fît attention, la situation sociale, ou plutôt les signes qui lui paraissaient impliquer qu’elle était élevée, comme de ne pas se découvrir en entrant dans le hall, de porter des knickerbockers, un paletot à taille, et de sortir un cigare ceint de pourpre et d’or d’un étui en maroquin écrasé (tous avantages, hélas ! qui me faisaient défaut). Il émaillait ses propos commerciaux d’expressions choisies, mais à contresens.","They were, dominating the distant sea from the top of their dune, or already accommodating themselves for the night at the foot of hills of a raw green and of an unkind shape, like that of the sofa of a hotel room where we have just arrived, made up of a few villas extended by a tennis court and sometimes a casino whose flag flapped in the cooling wind, hollow and anxious, small resorts which showed me their usual guests for the first time, but showed them from the outside - tennis players in white caps, the station master living there, near his tamarisk trees and his roses, a lady, wearing a ""boater's"" headdress, who, describing the daily route of a life that I would never know, recalled his greyhound who lingered, and returned to his chalet where the lamp was already lit – and which cruelly hurt my strange eyes and my disoriented heart with these strangely usual and disdainfully familiar images. But how much my suffering grew worse when we landed in the hall of the Grand-Hotel de Balbec, opposite the monumental staircase which imitated marble, and while my grandmother, without worrying about increasing the hostility and contempt for the strangers among whom we were going to live, discussed the ""conditions"" with the director, a sort of pushah with a face and a voice full of scars (which had been left by the extirpation on one of many pimples, on the other of the various accents due to distant origins and a cosmopolitan childhood), the socialite's tuxedo, the psychologist's gaze, generally taking, on the arrival of the ""omnibus"", the great lords for complainers and hotel rats for great lords. Probably forgetting that he himself did not receive five hundred francs monthly salary, he profoundly despised people for whom five hundred francs, or rather as he said ""twenty-five louis"" is ""a sum"" and considered them as part of of a race of outcasts for whom the Grand Hotel was not intended. It is true that, in this very Palace, there were people who did not pay very much while being esteemed by the director, provided that the latter was certain that they were looking to spend not out of poverty but out of avarice. It cannot in fact take anything away from prestige, since it is a vice and can therefore be found in all social situations. Social status was the only thing the headmaster paid attention to, social status, or rather the signs that he thought implied she was brought up, such as not uncovering when entering the lobby, wearing knickerbockers, a waist coat, and to take out a cigar girded with purple and gold from a crushed morocco case (all advantages, alas! which I lacked). He interspersed his business remarks with chosen expressions, but in the wrong direction.","These were—commanding the distant sea from the crests of their several dunes or folding themselves already for the night beneath hills of a crude green colour and uncomfortable shape, like that of the sofa in one's bedroom in an hotel at which one has just arrived, each composed of a cluster of villas whose line was extended to include a lawn–tennis court and now and then a casino, over which a flag would be snapping in the freshening breeze, like a hollow cough—a series of watering–places which now let me see for the first time their regular visitors, but let me see only the external features of those visitors—lawn–tennis players in white hats, the station–master spending all his life there on the spot among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a straw 'boater' who, following the everyday routine of an existence which I should never know, was calling to her dog which had stopped to examine something in the road before going in to her bungalow where the lamp was already lighted for her return—which with these strangely usual and slightingly familiar sights stung my ungreeted eyes and stabbed my exiled heart. But how much were my sufferings increased when we had finally landed in the hall of the Grand Hotel at Balbec, and I stood there in front of the monumental staircase that looked like marble, while my grandmother, regardless of the growing hostility of the strangers among whom we should have to live, discussed 'terms' with the manager, a sort of nodding mandarin whose face and voice were alike covered with scars (left by the excision of countless pustules from one and from the other of the divers accents acquired from an alien ancestry and in a cosmopolitan upbringing) who stood there in a smart dinner–jacket, with the air of an expert psychologist, classifying, whenever the 'omnibus' discharged a fresh load, the 'nobility and gentry' as 'geesers' and the 'hotel crooks' as nobility and gentry. Forgetting, probably, that he himself was not drawing five hundred francs a month, he had a profound contempt for people to whom five hundred francs—or, as he preferred to put it,'twenty– five louis' was 'a lot of money,' and regarded them as belonging to a race of pariahs for whom the Grand Hotel was certainly not intended. It is true that even within its walls there were people who did not pay very much and yet had not forfeited the manager's esteem, provided that he was assured that they were watching their expenditure not from poverty so much as from avarice. For this could in no way lower their standing since it is a vice and may consequently be found at every grade of social position. Social position was the one thing by which the manager was impressed, social position, or rather the signs which seemed to him to imply that it was exalted, such as not taking one's hat off when one came into the hall, wearing knickerbockers, or an overcoat with a waist, and taking a cigar with a band of purple and gold out of a crushed morocco case—to none of which advantages could I, alas, lay claim. He would also adorn his business conversation with choice expressions, to which, as a rule, he gave a wrong meaning.","These little places, perched high on their dune above a distant sea or already settling down for the night in the lee of flagrantly green hills, which were as ungainly as a hotel-room sofa when one sees it for the first time, were composed of a few villas, a tennis court and sometimes a casino with its pennant flapping in the fretful, freshening, vacuous wind, and showed me now for the first time their habitual denizens, leading their outside lives – tennis players in white caps, a station-master living on the premises with his tamarisk and his roses, a lady in a boater calling her dawdling whippet, then walking back towards her holiday house where the lamp was already lit, her steps revealing the daily shape of a life which I would never come to know – all of which, with the uncanny familiarity and disdainful everydayness of these glimpses, wounded my stranger’s eyes and my homesick heart. However, this was nothing to the pain I was to suffer once we had come to rest in the vestibule of the Grand-Hôtel at Balbec and were faced with its monumental staircase in imitation marble and its manager, a dumpy little person whose face and voice were covered in the scars left by the removal of many pimples and the addition of many accents betokening distant origins and a cosmopolitan upbringing, who was wearing tails like a fashionable gentleman, whose acute psychological glances at those who stepped off the ‘omnibus’ usually enabled him to take a duke for a skinflint and a hotel thief for a duke, and with whom my grandmother, oblivious to the animosity and disdain she must be fostering in the strangers among whom we were to live, set about a discussion of terms. The manager, no doubt forgetting that his own salary did not amount to 500 francs a month, had a withering scorn for anyone who thought 500 francs, or as he put it ‘Twenty-five louis’, was a substantial sum, and he looked down on them as a breed of untouchables whose place was not at the Grand-Hôtel. There were, of course, even at the Grand-Hôtel, guests who could enjoy living quite cheaply without forfeiting the good opinion of the manager, as long as he was sure their penny-pinching was motivated not by poverty but by miserliness. For miserliness, being a vice and therefore at home in any social class, is in no way incompatible with prestige. Class was the only thing the manager paid attention to, or rather he was impressed by anything which he believed showed high class, such as a man stepping into the vestibule without taking off his hat, or people who wore plus-fours with a waisted coat and extracted purple-and-gold-banded cigars from cases of crushed morocco (none of which signs, alas, could I display). He sprinkled his commercial patter with choice expressions, which he misused."
"Mon père avait pour mon genre d’intelligence un mépris suffisamment corrigé par la tendresse pour qu’au total, son sentiment sur tout ce que je faisais fût une indulgence aveugle. Aussi n’hésita-t-il pas à m’envoyer chercher un petit poème en prose que j’avais fait autrefois à Combray en revenant d’une promenade. Je l’avais écrit avec une exaltation qu’il me semblait devoir communiquer à ceux qui le liraient. Mais elle ne dut pas gagner M. de Norpois, car ce fut sans me dire une parole qu’il me le rendit.","My father had a contempt for my kind of intelligence sufficiently corrected by tenderness that on the whole his feeling about everything I did was one of blind indulgence. So he did not hesitate to send for me a little prose poem which I had once written at Combray on my return from a walk. I had written it with an exaltation which it seemed to me that I should communicate to those who would read it. But she must not have won M. de Norpois, for it was without saying a word to me that he returned it to me.","The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little 'prose poem' which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of exaltation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word.","My father’s attitude to my type of mind was scorn sufficiently diluted by affection for his reaction to whatever I did to be, on the whole, blind indulgence. So he had no hesitation in sending me to fetch a little prose poem I had written one year at Combray on the way home from an outing. I had written it in a state of exhilaration which I felt it must directly convey to anyone who read it. But my exhilaration must have failed to touch M. de Norpois; and he handed it back to me without a word."
"Pour Mme Cottard, mon père s’étonnait que Mme Swann pût trouver quelque avantage à attirer cette bourgeoise peu élégante et disait : « Malgré la situation du professeur, j’avoue que je ne comprends pas. » Ma mère, elle, au contraire, comprenait très bien ; elle savait qu’une grande partie des plaisirs qu’une femme trouve à pénétrer dans un milieu différent de celui où elle vivait autrefois lui manquerait si elle ne pouvait informer ses anciennes relations de celles, relativement plus brillantes, par lesquelles elle les a remplacées. Pour cela il faut un témoin qu’on laisse pénétrer dans ce monde nouveau et délicieux, comme dans une fleur un insecte bourdonnant et volage, qui ensuite, au hasard de ses visites, répandra, on l’espère du moins, la nouvelle, le germe dérobé d’envie et d’admiration. Mme Cottard toute trouvée pour remplir ce rôle rentrait dans cette catégorie spéciale d’invités que maman, qui avait certains côtés de la tournure d’esprit de son père, appelait des : « Étranger, va dire à Sparte ! » D’ailleurs – en dehors d’une autre raison qu’on ne sut que bien des années après – Mme Swann en conviant cette amie bienveillante, réservée et modeste, n’avait pas craint d’introduire chez soi, à ses « jours » brillants, un traître ou une concurrente. Elle savait le nombre énorme de calices bourgeois que pouvait, quand elle était armée de l’aigrette et du porte-cartes, visiter en un seul après-midi cette active ouvrière. Elle en connaissait le pouvoir de dissémination et, en se basant sur le calcul des probabilités, était fondée à penser que, très vraisemblablement, tel habitué des Verdurin apprendrait dès le surlendemain que le gouverneur de Paris avait mis des cartes chez elle, ou que M. Verdurin lui-même entendrait raconter que M. Le Hault de Pressagny, président du Concours hippique, les avait emmenés, elle et Swann, au gala du roi Théodose ; elle ne supposait les Verdurin informés que de ces deux événements flatteurs pour elle, parce que les matérialisations particulières sous lesquelles nous nous représentons et nous poursuivons la gloire sont peu nombreuses par le défaut de notre esprit, qui n’est pas capable d’imaginer à la fois toutes les formes que nous espérons bien d’ailleurs – en gros – que, simultanément, elle ne manquera pas de revêtir pour nous.","As for Madame Cottard, my father was surprised that Madame Swann could find some advantage in attracting this inelegant bourgeoise and said: ""Despite the professor's situation, I confess that I don't understand."" My mother, on the contrary, understood very well; she knew that many of the pleasures a woman finds in entering a milieu different from that in which she once lived would be missed if she could not inform her former relations of the comparatively brighter ones by which she replaced them. To do this, a witness is needed who is allowed to enter this new and delicious world, like a buzzing and fickle insect in a flower, which then, randomly visiting, will spread, we hope at least, the news, the stolen germ of envy and admiration. Madame Cottard was found to fill this role, falling into that special category of guests whom Mama, who had certain aspects of her father's turn of mind, called: ""Stranger, go tell Sparta!"" Moreover – apart from another reason which we did not know until many years later – Mme Swann, in inviting this benevolent, reserved and modest friend, had not been afraid to introduce into her home, in her “days brilliant, a traitor or a competitor. She knew the enormous number of bourgeois chalices that this active worker could, when she was armed with the aigrette and the card-case, visit in a single afternoon. She knew the power of dissemination and, based on the calculation of probabilities, was justified in thinking that, very likely, some regular Verdurin would learn two days later that the Governor of Paris had put cards in her house, or that Mme. Verdurin himself would hear it said that M. Le Hault de Pressagny, president of the Horse Show, had taken her and Swann to the gala of King Theodosius; she only supposed the Verdurins informed of these two flattering events for her, because the particular materializations under which we represent ourselves and we pursue glory are few through the defect of our mind, which is not capable of imagining at all. at the same time all the forms that we indeed hope – roughly speaking – that, simultaneously, it will not fail to take on for us.","Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: ""In spite of the Professor's position, I must say that I cannot understand it. "" Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye–witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world (as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower) and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma (who inherited certain facets of her father's turn of mind) used to call the 'Tell Sparta' people. Besides—apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later—Mme. Swann, in inviting this good–natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawing–room, on her brilliant 'days,' a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card–case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature's power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope—in a general way—that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit.","In the case of Mme Cottard, my father was amazed that Mme Swann should think there was kudos to be got from the company of such a dowdy middle-class person: ‘Even allowing for the Professor’s position, I must say it’s beyond me.’ To my mother, on the other hand, it was quite clear: she knew that a woman could miss much of the pleasure to be got from graduating to circles different from those she moved in before, if she cannot inform her old acquaintances about the relatively more conspicuous acquaintances with whom she has replaced them. For this purpose, a witness is required, who shall be allowed into the world of new delights, as the blundering insect plunders a flower then flies off to visit others, to spread the news, or so it is hoped, sprinkling its random pollens of envy and admiration. Mme Cottard, perfect for this role, belonged to that special category of guests whom Mama, who had some of her father’s style of wit, called ‘Strangers to Speak in Sparta’.35 Besides, – apart from another reason which did not come to light until many years later – in inviting this friend, who was demure, reserved and well-meaning, to her splendid at-homes, Mme Swann had no need to fear she might be harbouring a traitor or a competitor. She knew the great number of middle-class blooms that this tireless worker, armed with her plumed hat and her little card-case, could pollinate in one busy afternoon. She knew how prolific this form of seeding could be; and, allowing for the law of averages, she was right to expect that, by the next day but one, this or that ‘regular’ of the Verdurins’ would have heard of the card left on her by the Commanding Officer of the Paris region, or even that M. Verdurin in person would be told that none other than the Chairman of the Turf Club, M. Le Hault de Pressagny, had included the Swanns in his party for the grand ball in honour of King Theodosius. She imagined that these two events, both of them flattering for herself, would be the only ones the Verdurins would learn of, for the particular concrete manifestations of fame which we like to picture and to which we aspire are few, given our penury of mind and our inability to imagine simultaneously more than one of the many blessings of fame, though we still harbour the vague hope of seeing them all descend upon us at once."
"Hélas ! cette première matinée fut une grande déception. Mon père nous proposa de nous déposer ma grand’mère et moi au théâtre, en se rendant à sa Commission. Avant de quitter la maison, il dit à ma mère : « Tâche d’avoir un bon dîner ; tu te rappelles que je dois ramener de Norpois ? » Ma mère ne l’avait pas oublié. Et depuis la veille, Françoise, heureuse de s’adonner à cet art de la cuisine pour lequel elle avait certainement un don, stimulée, d’ailleurs, par l’annonce d’un convive nouveau, et sachant qu’elle aurait à composer, selon des méthodes sues d’elle seule, du bœuf à la gelée, vivait dans l’effervescence de la création ; comme elle attachait une importance extrême à la qualité intrinsèque des matériaux qui devaient entrer dans la fabrication de son œuvre, elle allait elle-même aux Halles se faire donner les plus beaux carrés de romsteck, de jarret de bœuf, de pied de veau, comme Michel-Ange passant huit mois dans les montagnes de Carrare à choisir les blocs de marbre les plus parfaits pour le monument de Jules II. Françoise dépensait dans ces allées et venues une telle ardeur que maman voyant sa figure enflammée craignait que notre vieille servante ne tombât malade de surmenage comme l’auteur du Tombeau des Médicis dans les carrières de Peitraganta. Et dès la veille Françoise avait envoyé cuire dans le four du boulanger, protégé de mie de pain comme du marbre rose, ce qu’elle appelait du jambon de Nev’York. Croyant la langue moins riche qu’elle n’est et ses propres oreilles peu sûres, sans doute la première fois qu’elle avait entendu parler de jambon d’York avait-elle cru – trouvant d’une prodigalité invraisemblable dans le vocabulaire qu’il pût exister à la fois York et New York – qu’elle avait mal entendu et qu’on aurait voulu dire le nom qu’elle connaissait déjà. Aussi, depuis, le mot d’York se faisait précéder dans ses oreilles ou devant ses yeux si elle lisait une annonce de : New qu’elle prononçait Nev’. Et c’est de la meilleure foi du monde qu’elle disait à sa fille de cuisine : « Allez me chercher du jambon chez Olida. Madame m’a bien recommandé que ce soit du Nev’York. » Ce jour-là, si Françoise avait la brûlante certitude des grands créateurs, mon lot était la cruelle inquiétude du chercheur. Sans doute, tant que je n’eus pas entendu la Berma, j’éprouvai du plaisir. J’en éprouvai dans le petit square qui précédait le théâtre et dont, deux heures plus tard, les marronniers dénudés allaient luire avec des reflets métalliques dès que les becs de gaz allumés éclaireraient le détail de leurs ramures ; devant les employés du contrôle, desquels le choix, l’avancement, le sort, dépendaient de la grande artiste – qui seule détenait le pouvoir dans cette administration à la tête de laquelle des directeurs éphémères et purement nominaux se succédaient obscurément – et qui prirent nos billets sans nous regarder, agités qu’ils étaient de savoir si toutes les prescriptions de MmeBerma avaient bien été transmises au personnel nouveau, s’il était bien entendu que la claque ne devait jamais applaudir pour elle, que les fenêtres devaient être ouvertes tant qu’elle ne serait pas en scène et la moindre porte fermée après, un pot d’eau chaude dissimulé près d’elle pour faire tomber la poussière du plateau : et, en effet, dans un moment sa voiture attelée de deux chevaux à longue crinière allait s’arrêter devant le théâtre, elle en descendrait enveloppée dans des fourrures, et, répondant d’un geste maussade aux saluts, elle enverrait une de ses suivantes s’informer de l’avant-scène qu’on avait réservée pour ses amis, de la température de la salle, de la composition des loges, de la tenue des ouvreuses, théâtre et public n’étant pour elle qu’un second vêtement plus extérieur dans lequel elle entrerait et le milieu plus ou moins bon conducteur que son talent aurait à traverser. Je fus heureux aussi dans la salle même ; depuis que je savais que – contrairement à ce que m’avaient si longtemps représenté mes imaginations enfantines – il n’y avait qu’une scène pour tout le monde, je pensais qu’on devait être empêché de bien voir par les autres spectateurs comme on l’est au milieu d’une foule ; or je me rendis compte qu’au contraire, grâce à une disposition qui est comme le symbole de toute perception, chacun se sent le centre du théâtre ; ce qui m’explique qu’une fois qu’on avait envoyé Françoise voir un mélodrame aux troisièmes galeries, elle avait assuré en rentrant que sa place était la meilleure qu’on pût avoir et qu’au lieu de se trouver trop loin, s’était sentie intimidée par la proximité mystérieuse et vivante du rideau. Mon plaisir s’accrut encore quand je commençai à distinguer derrière ce rideau baissé des bruits confus comme on en entend sous la coquille d’un œuf quand le poussin va sortir, qui bientôt grandirent, et tout à coup, de ce monde impénétrable à notre regard, mais qui nous voyait du sien, s’adressèrent indubitablement à nous sous la forme impérieuse de trois coups aussi émouvants que des signaux venus de la planète Mars. Et – ce rideau une fois levé – quand sur la scène une table à écrire et une cheminée assez ordinaires, d’ailleurs, signifièrent que les personnages qui allaient entrer seraient, non pas des acteurs venus pour réciter comme j’en avais vus une fois en soirée, mais des hommes en train de vivre chez eux un jour de leur vie dans laquelle je pénétrais par effraction sans qu’ils pussent me voir – mon plaisir continua de durer ; il fut interrompu par une courte inquiétude : juste comme je dressais l’oreille avant que commençât la pièce, deux hommes entrèrent par la scène, bien en colère, puisqu’ils parlaient assez fort pour que dans cette salle où il y avait plus de mille personnes on distinguât toutes leurs paroles, tandis que dans un petit café on est obligé de demander au garçon ce que disent deux individus qui se collettent ; mais dans le même instant étonné de voir que le public les entendait sans protester, submergé qu’il était par un unanime silence sur lequel vint bientôt clapoter un rire ici, un autre là, je compris que ces insolents étaient les acteurs et que la petite pièce, dite lever de rideau, venait de commencer. Elle fut suivie d’un entr’acte si long que les spectateurs revenus à leurs places s’impatientaient, tapaient des pieds. J’en étais effrayé ; car de même que dans le compte rendu d’un procès, quand je lisais qu’un homme d’un noble cœur allait venir, au mépris de ses intérêts, témoigner en faveur d’un innocent, je craignais toujours qu’on ne fût pas assez gentil pour lui, qu’on ne lui marquât pas assez de reconnaissance, qu’on ne le récompensât pas richement, et, qu’écœuré, il se mît du côté de l’injustice ; de même, assimilant en cela le génie à la vertu, j’avais peur que la Berma dépitée par les mauvaises façons d’un public aussi mal élevé – dans lequel j’aurais voulu au contraire qu’elle pût reconnaître avec satisfaction quelques célébrités au jugement de qui elle eût attaché de l’importance – ne lui exprimât son mécontentement et son dédain en jouant mal. Et je regardais d’un air suppliant ces brutes trépignantes qui allaient briser dans leur fureur l’impression fragile et précieuse que j’étais venu chercher. Enfin, les derniers moments de mon plaisir furent pendant les premières scènes de Phèdre. Le personnage de Phèdre ne paraît pas dans ce commencement du second acte ; et, pourtant, dès que le rideau fut levé et qu’un second rideau, en velours rouge celui-là, se fut écarté, qui dédoublait la profondeur de la scène dans toutes les pièces où jouait l’étoile, une actrice entra par le fond, qui avait la figure et la voix qu’on m’avait dit être celles de la Berma. On avait dû changer la distribution, tout le soin que j’avais mis à étudier le rôle de la femme de Thésée devenait inutile. Mais une autre actrice donna la réplique à la première. J’avais dû me tromper en prenant celle-là pour la Berma, car la seconde lui ressemblait davantage encore et, plus que l’autre, avait sa diction. Toutes deux d’ailleurs ajoutaient à leur rôle de nobles gestes – que je distinguais clairement et dont je comprenais la relation avec le texte, tandis qu’elles soulevaient leurs beaux péplums – et aussi des intonations ingénieuses, tantôt passionnées, tantôt ironiques, qui me faisaient comprendre la signification d’un vers que j’avais lu chez moi sans apporter assez d’attention à ce qu’il voulait dire. Mais tout d’un coup, dans l’écartement du rideau rouge du sanctuaire, comme dans un cadre, une femme parut et aussitôt, à la peur que j’eus, bien plus anxieuse que pouvait être celle de la Berma qu’on la gênât en ouvrant une fenêtre, qu’on altérât le son d’une de ses paroles en froissant un programme, qu’on l’indisposât en applaudissant ses camarades, en ne l’applaudissant pas elle, assez ; – à ma façon, plus absolue encore que celle de la Berma, de ne considérer, dès cet instant, salle, public, acteurs, pièce, et mon propre corps que comme un milieu acoustique n’ayant d’importance que dans la mesure où il était favorable aux inflexions de cette voix, je compris que les deux actrices que j’admirais depuis quelques minutes n’avaient aucune ressemblance avec celle que j’étais venu entendre. Mais en même temps tout mon plaisir avait cessé ; j’avais beau tendre vers la Berma mes yeux, mes oreilles, mon esprit, pour ne pas laisser échapper une miette des raisons qu’elle me donnerait de l’admirer, je ne parvenais pas à en recueillir une seule. Je ne pouvais même pas, comme pour ses camarades, distinguer dans sa diction et dans son jeu des intonations intelligentes, de beaux gestes. Je l’écoutais comme j’aurais lu Phèdre, ou comme si Phèdre elle-même avait dit en ce moment les choses que j’entendais, sans que le talent de la Berma semblât leur avoir rien ajouté. J’aurais voulu – pour pouvoir l’approfondir, pour tâcher d’y découvrir ce qu’elle avait de beau – arrêter, immobiliser longtemps devant moi chaque intonation de l’artiste, chaque expression de sa physionomie ; du moins, je tâchais, à force d’agilité morale, en ayant avant un vers mon attention tout installée et mise au point, de ne pas distraire en préparatifs une parcelle de la durée de chaque mot, de chaque geste, et, grâce à l’intensité de mon attention, d’arriver à descendre en eux aussi profondément que j’aurais fait si j’avais eu de longues heures à moi. Mais que cette durée était brève ! À peine un son était-il reçu dans mon oreille qu’il était remplacé par un autre. Dans une scène où la Berma reste immobile un instant, le bras levé à la hauteur du visage baigné, grâce à un artifice d’éclairage, dans une lumière verdâtre, devant le décor qui représente la mer, la salle éclata en applaudissements, mais déjà l’actrice avait changé de place et le tableau que j’aurais voulu étudier n’existait plus. Je dis à ma grand’mère que je ne voyais pas bien, elle me passa sa lorgnette. Seulement, quand on croit à la réalité des choses, user d’un moyen artificiel pour se les faire montrer n’équivaut pas tout à fait à se sentir près d’elles. Je pensais que ce n’était plus la Berma que je voyais, mais son image, dans le verre grossissant. Je reposai la lorgnette ; mais peut-être l’image que recevait mon œil, diminuée par l’éloignement, n’était pas plus exacte ; laquelle des deux Berma était la vraie ? Quant à la déclaration à Hippolyte, j’avais beaucoup compté sur ce morceau où, à en juger par la signification ingénieuse que ses camarades me découvraient à tout moment dans des parties moins belles, elle aurait certainement des intonations plus surprenantes que celles que chez moi, en lisant, j’avais tâché d’imaginer ; mais elle n’atteignit même pas jusqu’à celles qu’Œnone ou Aricie eussent trouvées, elle passa au rabot d’une mélopée uniforme toute la tirade où se trouvèrent confondues ensemble des oppositions, pourtant si tranchées, qu’une tragédienne à peine intelligente, même des élèves de lycée, n’en eussent pas négligé l’effet ; d’ailleurs, elle la débita tellement vite que ce fut seulement quand elle fut arrivée au dernier vers que mon esprit prit conscience de la monotonie voulue qu’elle avait imposée aux premiers.","Alas! this first morning was a great disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me off at the theater on his way to his Commission. Before leaving the house, he said to my mother: “Try to have a good dinner; do you remember that I have to bring back from Norpois? My mother had not forgotten him. And since the day before, Françoise, happy to devote herself to this art of cooking for which she certainly had a gift, stimulated, moreover, by the announcement of a new guest, and knowing that she would have to compose , according to methods known only to her, from beef to jelly, lived in the effervescence of creation; as she attached extreme importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials that were to go into the making of her work, she went herself to Les Halles to get the most beautiful squares of romsteck, beef shank, calf's foot, such as Michelangelo spending eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II. Françoise spent such ardor in these comings and goings that Maman, seeing her face inflamed, feared that our old servant might fall ill from overwork like the author of the Tomb of the Medici in the quarries of Peitraganta. And the day before Françoise had sent to cook in the baker's oven, protected with breadcrumbs like pink marble, what she called Nev'York ham. Believing the language less rich than it is and her own ears insecure, no doubt the first time she had heard of York ham had she believed - finding an incredible prodigality in the vocabulary that there could be both York and New York – that she had misheard and that one would have liked to say the name she already knew. Also, since then, the word of York was preceded in her ears or in front of her eyes if she read an announcement of: New which she pronounced Nev '. And it was in the best faith in the world that she said to her kitchen daughter: “Go and get me some ham from Olida. Madame recommended that it be from Nev'York. That day, if Françoise had the burning certainty of great creators, my lot was the cruel concern of the researcher. No doubt, as long as I had not heard Berma, I felt pleasure. I experienced it in the little square which preceded the theater and where, two hours later, the bare chestnut trees were going to gleam with metallic reflections as soon as the lighted gaslights illuminated the detail of their branches; before the control employees, whose choice, advancement, fate, depended on the great artist – who alone held power in this administration at the head of which ephemeral and purely nominal directors followed one another obscurely – and who took our tickets without looking at us, agitated as they were to know if all of Mme. 'she would not be on stage and the slightest door closed afterwards, a pot of hot water concealed near her to knock the dust off the stage: and, indeed, in a moment her carriage drawn by two long-maned horses was going to stop in front of the theatre, she would get out wrapped in furs, and, responding with a sullen gesture to the salutations, she would send one of her attendants to inquire about the proscenium which had been reserved. her friends, the temperature of the hall, the composition of the boxes, the dress of the ushers, the theater and the public being for her only a second, more external garment into which she would enter and the environment more or less good conductor that his talent would have to cross. I was also happy in the room itself; since I knew that - contrary to what my childish imaginations had represented to me for so long - there was only one scene for everyone, I thought that one should be prevented from seeing well by the other spectators as one is in the midst of a crowd; but I realized that on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is like the symbol of all perception, everyone feels the center of the theater; which explains to me that once we had sent Françoise to see a melodrama at the third galleries, she had assured us on her return that her place was the best one could have and that instead of being too far away, I felt intimidated by the mysterious and lively closeness of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind this lowered curtain confused noises such as one hears under the shell of an egg when the chick is about to emerge, which soon grew, and suddenly, from this impenetrable world to our look, but who saw us from his own, undoubtedly addressed us in the imperious form of three knocks as moving as signals from the planet Mars. And – this curtain once raised – when on the stage a fairly ordinary writing table and fireplace, by the way, meant that the characters who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite as I had once seen in the evening, but men living at home one day of their life in which I penetrated by breaking and entering without their being able to see me – my pleasure continued to last; he was interrupted by a brief trepidation: just as I was prickling my ears before the play began, two men entered the stage, very angry, since they were talking loud enough so that in this room where there were more than a thousand people one could distinguish all their words, whereas in a small cafe one is obliged to ask the waiter what two individuals are saying who are colliding; but at the same moment surprised to see that the public heard them without protest, overwhelmed as it was by a unanimous silence on which soon came a laughter here, another there, I realized that these insolent were the actors and that the little play, called the curtain raiser, had just begun. It was followed by an intermission so long that the spectators returned to their seats grew impatient and stamped their feet. I was frightened; for just as in the report of a trial, when I read that a man of noble heart was going to come, in defiance of his interests, to testify in favor of an innocent, I always feared that one would not be not nice enough for him, that they did not show him enough gratitude, that they did not reward him richly, and that, disgusted, he put himself on the side of injustice; likewise, equating genius with virtue in this, I was afraid that Berma, vexed by the bad manners of such an ill-bred audience – in which I would have liked, on the contrary, she could recognize with satisfaction a few celebrities at the judgment of which she would have attached importance – did not express her displeasure and disdain by playing badly. And I gazed beseechingly at these stamping brutes who were going to shatter in their fury the fragile and precious impression that I had come to seek. Finally, the last moments of my pleasure were during the first scenes of Phèdre. The character of Phèdre does not appear in this beginning of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain was raised and a second curtain, this one of red velvet, had parted, which doubled the depth of the stage in all the rooms where the star was playing, an actress entered through the background, who had the face and the voice that I had been told were those of Berma. We had to change the cast, all the care I had taken to study the role of Thésée's wife had become useless. But another actress gave the reply to the first. I must have been mistaken in mistaking this one for Berma, because the second resembled her even more and, more than the other, had her diction. Both, moreover, added to their roles noble gestures – which I could clearly distinguish and whose relationship with the text I understood, while they lifted their beautiful peplums – and also ingenious intonations, sometimes passionate, sometimes ironic, which conveyed the meaning of a verse I had read at home without paying enough attention to what it meant. But suddenly, in the gap between the red curtain of the sanctuary, as if in a frame, a woman appeared and immediately, to my fear, much more anxious than could be that of Berma embarrassed by opening a window, that someone altered the sound of one of her words by crumpling up a programme, that they upset her by applauding her comrades, by not applauding her enough; – in my way, even more absolute than that of Berma, of considering, from that moment on, the auditorium, the audience, the actors, the room, and my own body only as an acoustic environment that only matters insofar as he was in favor of the inflections of this voice, I realized that the two actresses I had been admiring for a few minutes bore no resemblance to the one I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; In vain I turned my eyes, my ears, my mind towards Berma, so as not to miss a crumb of the reasons she would give me for admiring her, I could not manage to collect a single one. I could not even, as for his comrades, distinguish in his diction and in his play intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to him as I would have read Phèdre, or as if Phèdre herself had just said the things I was hearing, without La Berma's talent seeming to have added anything to them. I would have liked – in order to be able to go deeper into it, to try to discover in it what was beautiful in it – to stop, to immobilize for a long time before me each intonation of the artist, each expression of his physiognomy; at least, I tried, by dint of moral agility, having before a verse my attention all installed and focused, not to distract in preparations a parcel of the duration of each word, of each gesture, and, thanks to the intensity of my attention, to manage to descend into them as deeply as I would have done if I had had long hours to myself. But how short was that time! No sooner was a sound received in my ear than it was replaced by another. In a scene where La Berma remains motionless for a moment, her arm raised at the height of her face bathed, thanks to an artifice of lighting, in a greenish light, in front of the decor which represents the sea, the room burst into applause, but already the actress had changed places and the painting I would have liked to study no longer existed. I told my grandmother that I couldn't see well, she passed me her telescope. Only, when you believe in the reality of things, using an artificial means to have them shown to you is not quite equivalent to feeling close to them. I thought it was no longer Berma I saw, but her image, in the magnifying glass. I put down the telescope; but perhaps the image which my eye received, diminished by the distance, was not more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real one? As for the declaration to Hippolyte, I had counted a great deal on this piece where, judging by the ingenious meaning that his comrades constantly discovered for me in less beautiful parts, it would certainly have more surprising intonations than those that I , while reading, I had tried to imagine; but she did not even reach those which Œnone or Aricie had found, she smoothed over with a uniform chant the whole tirade in which oppositions were found together, yet so clear-cut that a barely intelligent tragedian , even high school students, would not have neglected the effect; indeed, she spouted it off so fast that it was only when she got to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony she had imposed on the earlier ones.","Alas! that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: ""See that you have a good dinner for us to–night; you remember, I'm bringing de Norpois back with me. "" My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Françoise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen,—of which she was indeed a past–master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly,—had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump–steak, shin of beef, calves'–feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II—Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Françoise had sent to be cooked in the baker's oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a ""Nev'–York ham. "" Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt,—feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a ""York"" and a ""New York""—that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affix ""New"" which she pronounced ""Nev'"". And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen –maid: "" Go and fetch me a ham from Olida's. Madame told me especially to get a Nev'–York."" On that particular day, if Françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours' time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas–lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the box–office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist—for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession—who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of Mme. Berma's instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone's salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was 'in front,' who were in the other boxes, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less 'good' conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that—in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination—there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which explained to me why, when Françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer–blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And—once this curtain had risen,—when on the stage a writing–table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me—my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the 'curtain–raiser' had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble–minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue , I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill–bred an audience—in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance— should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Phèdre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle (a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the 'star' appeared), an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures—which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the text, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics—and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more vexing than Berma's fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough;—in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma's, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice,—I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma's eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were reading Phèdre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma's talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to explore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist's voice, every expression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back–cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study existed no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which Œnone or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout.","This first matinée was, alas, a great disappointment. My father had suggested giving my grandmother and myself a lift to the theatre, which was on his way to the Select Committee. As he left the house, he said to my mother, ‘You’ll make sure it’s a nice dinner tonight, won’t you? Remember, Norpois’s coming home with me.’ She had not forgotten. Since the day before, Françoise, glad to be practising the cook’s art for which she had a definite gift, inspired by the coming of a new guest, and knowing she was required to compose, in accordance with methods known only to herself, a dish of beef in aspic, had been living in a flurry of artistic creativity. Like Michelangelo spending eight months in the mountains of Carrara, selecting the most perfect blocks of marble for the tomb of Pope Julius II, Françoise, who attached extreme importance to the inherent quality of the materials out of which her masterpieces were to be wrought, had been down to Les Halles in person more than once to choose the finest slabs of rump steak, the best shin of beef and calf’s foot. She threw herself so strenuously into this pursuit that my mother, seeing our old servant turn red in the face, feared that, as the sculptor of the Medici tombs had sickened in the quarries at Pietrasanta, she might make herself ill from overwork. The day before, Françoise had sent down to the oven of the local baker what she called ‘a Nev York ham’, looking like pink marble inside its coating of breadcrumbs. In the belief that the language was poorer than it is, and her own ears less reliable than they were, the first time Françoise had heard of ‘York ham’, she must have deduced that the lexicon could not possibly be so abundant as to allow for both York and New York, that she had misheard and that the right name was the one she already knew. Hence, ever since, the name of York was always preceded, for Françoise’s ears and eyes, by the word New, which she pronounced ‘Nev’. So it was with total sincerity that she would say to her scullery-maid, ‘Go down to Olida’s and get some ham. Ma’am particularly said she wants the Nev York.’ On the day in question, while Françoise’s state of mind was the burning certainty of the great creators, my own was the thankless anxiety of the seeker after truth. To be sure, right up until the moment when I saw La Berma act, I enjoyed the day. I enjoyed it in the little garden outside the theatre, where two hours later, the gas-lamps, once lit, would cover the leafless horse-chestnuts in a metallic sheen and illuminate the details of their branches; I enjoyed it in the foyer, faced with the box-office staff, whose selection, promotion and fate all depended on the great artiste whose word was law in that theatre, in which there was an obscure succession of temporary and purely nominal managers; I enjoyed it as they took our tickets without a glance at us, in their anxiety to be sure that each and every requirement of Mme Berma’s had been definitely made known to the new employees, that the hired clappers must never applaud her, that windows had to stay open till she was on stage, but that every single door must then be closed, that a pitcher of hot water must be concealed near her, so as to keep down the dust – and sure enough, any moment now her carriage and long-maned pair would draw up in front of the theatre, she would step down wrapped in her furs, favour those who greeted her with a moody wave of the hand, then send one of her ladies-in-waiting to check that her friends had been allotted the proper stage-box, to see that the house temperature was right, find out who was in the best boxes tonight, inspect the attendants, for the theatre and the audience were no more than an outer garment which she put on, the medium of greater or lesser conductivity through which her talent had to pass. I even enjoyed it inside the auditorium; since learning that all the spectators looked at the same stage, unlike what my childish imagination had long pictured, I had supposed that so many people must make it as difficult for each of them to see as it is when one stands among a crowd; but now I realized that, because of the layout of the theatre, which is in a way symbolic of perception itself, each person has the impression of being at the centre; and this explained why Françoise, having been treated to a seat in the gods at a melodrama, had told us hers had been the best seat in the house and that, instead of feeling remote from the stage, she had been intimidated by the proximity of the curtain, which had seemed a mysterious living thing. I enjoyed it even more when, from behind the curtain, I began to hear sounds as vague and strange as those heard from inside the shell of an egg when a chick is about to emerge; they soon grew louder, until suddenly, from that world which our eye could not penetrate but which could see us, they became three portentous strokes,3 clearly intended for us and as thrilling as a message from Mars. The curtain having risen, my enjoyment continued at the sight of a writing-table and a fireplace, both of them quite nondescript actually, which obviously meant that any individuals who might come in would not be actors turning up to speak lines, like some I had once seen at a party, but just people in their own home, engaged in living a day of their lives, on which I happened to be eavesdropping. My pleasure was interrupted by a moment’s unease: just as I was looking forward to the beginning of the play, a couple of bad-tempered men came walking across the stage, raising their voices enough for everyone in that thousand-strong audience to make out every word, whereas when two customers start scuffling and shouting in a small café, you have to ask the waiter what they are saying; but at that same instant, in my surprise that everyone else was paying polite attention to them, all sitting submerged in unanimous silence, the surface of which was now and then broken by a ripple of laughter , I realized that this rude pair of intruders were the actors, and that the short play called a curtain-raiser had just begun. It was followed by an interval which went on for so long that the audience, having come back in, began to express their impatience by stamping their feet on the floor. I was alarmed at this; for, just as when I read in a report of a trial that a man of courage and honour was to jeopardize his own interests by giving evidence in defence of an innocent man,4 I dreaded the thought that people might not treat him well, that his act might not be properly acknowledged, that he might not be handsomely rewarded and that in his disgust he might even join the forces of injustice; so, equating genius with virtue , I was afraid that La Berma might take umbrage at the bad manners of such an uncouth audience (among whom I would have much preferred her to be able to recognize and draw comfort from a few celebrities whose good judgment she valued) and express her displeasure and disdain for them by acting badly. I gazed about me as though to implore these stamping savages not to trample underfoot the fragile, precious impression which had brought me there. The final vestiges of my enjoyment lasted until the opening scenes of the performance of Phèdre. The character of Phèdre does not appear in those early scenes of Act II; and yet no sooner had the curtain gone up, and the red velvet of another curtain had been partly opened, so as to double the depth of the stage, as was done in all the star’s performances, than there entered upstage an actress who looked and sounded exactly as I had been led to believe La Berma would. They must have changed the cast! All my careful study of the part of Theseus’s wife was pointless! But then a second actress engaged in a dialogue with the first one – I must have been mistaken in thinking she was La Berma, as this new-comer looked even more like the star and came much closer to her diction! Both of them now enhanced their speeches with noble gestures – which were clear and recognizably relevant to the text, as they lifted the folds of their fine robes – and with ingenious intonations, fraught with passion or irony, which showed me shades and depths in lines which I had read at home without paying enough attention to what they meant. Then suddenly a woman appeared between the parted curtains of the inner sanctum, standing there as though within a frame, and instantly – from the fear that filled me, much more acute than any La Berma might have felt, at the prospect of someone opening a window, spoiling her delivery of a line by rustling a programme, upsetting her by applauding her fellow actors, or by not applauding her enough, and from the effort of concentration, also greater than hers, which forced me from that moment on to sense the auditorium, the audience, the actors, the play and even my own person as nothing but an acoustical medium, of importance only insofar as it might enrich the modulations of that voice – I realized that the pair of actresses whom I had been admiring for some minutes past bore not the slightest resemblance to the one I was there to see and hear. But at the same time, all my enjoyment had dissipated: however hard I strained towards her with my eyes, ears and mind, so as not to miss a single scrap of the incentives she would offer me to admire her, I could not manage to find any. I could not even perceive in her diction or use of movement, as I had with the other actresses, any sensitivity of tone or delicacy of gesture. I sat there and listened to her as I might have read Phèdre, or as though at that moment Phèdre herself was saying the things I was hearing, without La Berma’s talent seeming to add anything at all to them. I wished I could arrest and hold motionless before me each of her intonations, freeze each of the changing expressions on her face, so as to study them in depth and find out what was beautiful in them; at least I tried, by using all my mental agility, by having my whole attention at the ready and focussed on a line just before its delivery, not to waste in preliminaries any iota of the time taken by each word or gesture, in the hope of being able, by sheer intensity of attention, to absorb each of them as I might have done if I had been able to hold them before me for hours on end. But the time they occupied was so short! My ear had barely registered each sound when it was replaced by the following one. In one scene, where La Berma stands still for a moment against a backdrop of the sea, with one arm raised to face level, and her whole figure given a greenish tint by an effect of the lighting, the audience had no sooner burst into applause than she had changed position and the tableau I wished I could study closely had disappeared. I told my grandmother I could not see very well and she lent me her opera-glasses. But when you believe in the reality of things, using an artificial means to see them better is not quite the same as feeling closer to them. I felt it was not La Berma that I was seeing, but only an enlarged picture of her. I put the glasses down – but what if the image received by the naked eye was no more accurate, given that it was an image reduced by distance? Which was the true Berma? When she reached Phèdre’s declaration of desire for Hippolyte, a part I had been specially looking forward to, because the diction of Oenone and Aricie kept revealing unsuspected subtleties in parts which were not as fine as it , I was sure her intonations would be more striking than any I had contrived to imagine while reading the play at home: but she did not even rise to the effects that the other two actresses would have managed; she blurred the whole speech into a toneless recitative, blunting the keen edges of contrasts which any semi-competent performer, even a girl in a school production, could hardly have failed to bring out; and she gabbled through it at such speed that it was not until she reached the closing line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotone in which she had delivered the opening ones."
"Je pus à peine répondre à l’employé qui voulut me prendre ma valise. Ma mère essayait, pour me consoler, des moyens qui lui paraissaient les plus efficaces. Elle croyait inutile d’avoir l’air de ne pas voir mon chagrin, elle le plaisantait doucement :","I could barely answer the employee who wanted to take my suitcase. My mother tried, to console me, the means which seemed to her the most effective. She thought it was useless to seem not to see my grief, she joked gently:","I could scarcely answer the man in the station who offered to take my bag. My mother, to comfort me, tried the methods which seemed to her most efficacious. Thinking it to be useless to appear not to notice my unhappiness, she gently teased me about it:","I was barely able to speak to the porter who offered to carry my suitcase. My mother tried to comfort me in ways which seemed appropriate to her. Instead of pretending not to see how unhappy I was, which she knew was pointless, she bantered:"
"Les levers de soleil sont un accompagnement des longs voyages en chemin de fer, comme les œufs durs, les journaux illustrés, les jeux de cartes, les rivières où des barques s’évertuent sans avancer. À un moment où je dénombrais les pensées qui avaient rempli mon esprit pendant les minutes précédentes, pour me rendre compte si je venais ou non de dormir (et où l’incertitude même qui me faisait me poser la question était en train de me fournir une réponse affirmative), dans le carreau de la fenêtre, au-dessus d’un petit bois noir, je vis des nuages échancrés dont le doux duvet était d’un rose fixé, mort, qui ne changera plus, comme celui qui teint les plumes de l’aile qui l’a assimilé ou le pastel sur lequel l’a déposé la fantaisie du peintre. Mais je sentais qu’au contraire cette couleur n’était ni inertie, ni caprice, mais nécessité et vie. Bientôt s’amoncelèrent derrière elle des réserves de lumière. Elle s’aviva, le ciel devint d’un incarnat que je tâchais, en collant mes yeux à la vitre, de mieux voir, car je le sentais en rapport avec l’existence profonde de la nature, mais la ligne du chemin de fer ayant changé de direction, le train tourna, la scène matinale fut remplacée dans le cadre de la fenêtre par un village nocturne aux toits bleus de clair de lune, avec un lavoir encrassé de la nacre opaline de la nuit, sous un ciel encore semé de toutes ses étoiles, et je me désolais d’avoir perdu ma bande de ciel rose quand je l’aperçus de nouveau, mais rouge cette fois, dans la fenêtre d’en face qu’elle abandonna à un deuxième coude de la voie ferrée ; si bien que je passais mon temps à courir d’une fenêtre à l’autre pour rapprocher, pour rentoiler les fragments intermittents et opposites de mon beau matin écarlate et versatile et en avoir une vue totale et un tableau continu.","Sunrises are an accompaniment to long railway journeys, like boiled eggs, illustrated newspapers, card games, rivers where boats struggle without advancing. At a time when I was counting the thoughts that had filled my mind during the previous minutes, to realize whether or not I had just slept (and when the very uncertainty that made me wonder was giving me a affirmative answer), in the pane of the window, above a small black wood, I saw indented clouds whose soft down was of a fixed, dead pink, which will not change any more, like that which dyes the feathers of the wing which assimilated it or the pastel on which the painter's imagination deposited it. But I felt that on the contrary this color was neither inertia nor whim, but necessity and life. Soon pools of light piled up behind her. It grew brighter, the sky became a crimson which I tried, by sticking my eyes to the window, to see better, for I felt it related to the deep existence of nature, but the railway line having changed direction, the train turned, the morning scene was replaced in the frame of the window by a nocturnal village with blue roofs of moonlight, with a wash-house dirty with the opaline mother-of-pearl of the night, under a sky still strewn with all its stars, and I was sorry to have lost my strip of pink sky when I saw it again, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the railway line; so much so that I spent my time running from one window to another to bring closer together, to reweave the intermittent and opposite fragments of my beautiful scarlet and versatile morning and to have a total view of it and a continuous picture.","Sunrise is a necessary concomitant of long railway journeys, just as are hard–boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers upon which boats strain but make no progress. At a certain moment,—when I was counting over the thoughts that had filled my mind, in the preceding minutes, so as to discover whether I had just been asleep or not (and when the very uncertainty which made me ask myself the question was to furnish me with an affirmative answer), in the pale square of the window, over a small black wood I saw some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink, not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the wing which has grown to wear it, or the sketch upon which the artist's fancy has washed it. But I felt that, unlike them, this colour was due neither to inertia nor to caprice but to necessity and life. Presently there gathered behind it reserves of light. It brightened; the sky turned to a crimson which I strove, gluing my eyes to the window, to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but, the course of the line altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of the window to a nocturnal village, its roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent nacre of night, beneath a firmament still powdered with all its stars, and I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it afresh, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the line, so that I spent my time running from one window to the other to reassemble, to collect oh a single canvas the intermittent, antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever–changing morning, and to obtain a comprehensive view of it and a continuous picture.","Sunrises are a feature of long train-journeys, like hard-boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers with boats straining forward but making no progress. As I sifted the thoughts which had been in my mind just a minute before, to see whether or not I had slept (my uncertainty about the matter already inclining me to the affirmative), I glimpsed in the window-pane, above a little black copse, serrated clouds of downy softness in a shade of immutable pink, dead and as seemingly indelible now as the pink inseparable from feathers in a wing or a pastel dyed by the fancy of the painter. But in this shade I sensed neither inertia nor fancy, but necessity and life. Soon great reserves of light built up behind it. They brightened further, spreading a blush across the sky; and I stared at it through the glass, straining to see it better, as the colour of it seemed to be privy to the profoundest secrets of nature. Then the train turned away from it, the railway line having changed direction, the dawn scene framed in the window turned into a village by night, its roofs blue with moonlight, the wash-house smeared with the opal glow of darkness, under a sky still bristling with stars, and I was saddened by the loss of my strip of pink sky, when I caught sight of it again, now reddening, in the window on the other side, from which it disappeared at another bend in the line. And I dodged from one window to the other, trying to reassemble the offset intermittent fragments of my lovely, changeable red morning, so as to see it for once as a single lasting picture."
"Individualisées maintenant pourtant, la réplique que se donnaient les uns aux autres leurs regards animés de suffisance et d’esprit de camaraderie, et dans lesquels se rallumaient d’instant en instant tantôt l’intérêt, tantôt l’insolente indifférence dont brillait chacune, selon qu’il s’agissait de l’une de ses amies ou des passants, cette conscience aussi de se connaître entre elles assez intimement pour se promener toujours ensemble, en faisant « bande à part », mettaient entre leurs corps indépendants et séparés, tandis qu’ils s’avançaient lentement, une liaison invisible, mais harmonieuse comme une même ombre chaude, une même atmosphère, faisant d’eux un tout aussi homogène en ses parties qu’il était différent de la foule au milieu de laquelle se déroulait lentement leur cortège.","Individualized now, however, the retort given to each other by their glances animated by smugness and a spirit of camaraderie, and in which the interest, now the insolent indifference which each shone, whether it was one of her friends or passers-by, this awareness also of knowing each other intimately enough to always walk together, forming a ""band apart"", put between their independent and separate bodies, while that they advanced slowly, an invisible bond, but harmonious like the same warm shadow, the same atmosphere, making them as homogeneous in their parts as they were different from the crowd in the midst of which slowly unfolded their procession.","Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self–sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a 'band apart' established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound.","Though the girls were now individualized, the connivance in the glowing glances they kept exchanging, bright with conceit and their joy in being the little clique they were, flashing with self-interest or insolent indifference, depending on whether they were looking at each other or at people passing, as well as their sense of knowing one another closely enough to be always out together, to be ‘as thick as thieves’, linked their separate and independent bodies into an invisible harmony, as though they shared the same warm shade, walked within a separate atmosphere, which made of them an entity as alike in its parts as it was unlike the throng through which their closed little company wended its slow way."
"Je savais que mes amies étaient sur la digue mais je ne les voyais pas, tandis qu’elles passaient devant les chaînons inégaux de la mer, tout au fond de laquelle et perchée au milieu de ses cimes bleuâtres comme une bourgade italienne se distinguait parfois dans une éclaircie la petite ville de Rivebelle, minutieusement détaillée par le soleil. Je ne voyais pas mes amies, mais (tandis qu’arrivaient jusqu’à mon belvédère l’appel des marchands de journaux, « des journalistes », comme les nommait Françoise, les appels des baigneurs et des enfants qui jouaient, ponctuant à la façon des cris des oiseaux de mer le bruit du flot qui doucement se brisait), je devinais leur présence, j’entendais leur rire enveloppé comme celui des Néréides dans le doux déferlement qui montait jusqu’à mes oreilles. « Nous avons regardé, me disait le soir Albertine, pour voir si vous descendriez. Mais vos volets sont restés fermés, même à l’heure du concert. » À dix heures, en effet, il éclatait sous mes fenêtres. Entre les intervalles des instruments, si la mer était pleine, reprenait, coulé et continu, le glissement de l’eau d’une vague qui semblait envelopper les traits du violon dans ses volutes de cristal et faire jaillir son écume au-dessus des échos intermittents d’une musique sous-marine. Je m’impatientais qu’on ne fût pas encore venu me donner mes affaires pour que je puisse m’habiller. Midi sonnait, enfin arrivait Françoise. Et pendant des mois de suite, dans ce Balbec que j’avais tant désiré parce que je ne l’imaginais que battu par la tempête et perdu dans les brumes, le beau temps avait été si éclatant et si fixe que, quand elle venait ouvrir la fenêtre, j’avais pu, toujours sans être trompé, m’attendre à trouver le même pan de soleil plié à l’angle du mur extérieur, et d’une couleur immuable qui était moins émouvante comme un signe de l’été qu’elle n’était morne comme celle d’un émail inerte et factice. Et tandis que Françoise ôtait les épingles des impostes, détachait les étoffes, tirait les rideaux, le jour d’été qu’elle découvrait semblait aussi mort, aussi immémorial qu’une somptueuse et millénaire momie que notre vieille servante n’eût fait que précautionneusement désemmailloter de tous ses linges, avant de la faire apparaître, embaumée dans sa robe d’or.","I knew that my friends were on the breakwater but I did not see them, while they passed in front of the uneven links of the sea, at the very bottom of which and perched in the middle of its bluish peaks like an Italian village sometimes stood out in a clearing the small town of Rivebelle, minutely detailed by the sun. I didn't see my friends, but (while the calls from newsagents, ""journalists"" as Françoise called them, came to my belvedere, the calls from bathers and children playing, punctuating in the cries of seabirds, the sound of the gently breaking waves), I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like that of the Nereids in the gentle surge that rose to my ears. ""We looked,"" Albertine told me in the evening, ""to see if you would come down."" But your shutters remained closed, even at concert time. At ten o'clock, in fact, it burst under my windows. Between the intervals of the instruments, if the sea was full, resumed, flowing and continuous, the sliding of the water of a wave which seemed to wrap the features of the violin in its volutes of crystal and to make its foam spring above the echoes intermittent with underwater music. I was impatient that they had not yet come to give me my things so that I could get dressed. Midday struck, finally Francoise arrived. And for months in a row, in this Balbec which I had so desired because I only imagined it to be battered by the storm and lost in the mists, the fine weather had been so brilliant and so fixed that, when it came to open the window, I had been able, still without being deceived, to expect to find the same pan of sunlight bent at the angle of the exterior wall, and of an unchanging color which was less moving as a sign of summer than It wasn't dull like that of an inert and artificial enamel. And while Françoise was removing the pins from the transoms, unfastening the fabrics, drawing the curtains, the summer day she was discovering seemed as dead, as immemorial as a sumptuous, thousand-year-old mummy that our old servant had only carefully made. unswaddle all her clothes, before making her appear, embalmed in her golden dress.","I knew that my friends were on the 'front,' but I did not see them as they passed before the links of the sea's uneven chain, far at the back of which, and nestling amid its bluish peaks like an Italian citadel, one could occasionally, in a clear moment, make out the little town of Rivebelle, drawn in minutest detail by the sun. I did not see my friends, but ( while there mounted to my belvedere the shout of the newsboy, the 'journalists' as Françoise used to call them, the shouts of the bathers and of children at play, punctuating like the cries of sea–birds the sound of the gently breaking waves) I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like the laughter of the Nereids in the smooth tide of sound that rose to my ears. ""We looked up,"" said Albertine in the evening, ""to see if you were coming down. But your shutters were still closed when the concert began. "" At ten o'clock, sure enough, it broke out beneath my windows. In the intervals in the blare of the instruments, if the tide were high, would begin again, slurred and continuous, the gliding surge of a wave which seemed to enfold the notes of the violin in its crystal spirals and to be spraying its foam over echoes of a submarine music. I grew impatient because no one had yet come with my things, so that I might rise and dress. Twelve o'clock struck, Françoise arrived at last. And for months on end, in this Balbec to which I had so looked forward because I imagined it only as battered by the storm and buried in fogs , the weather had been so dazzling and so unchanging that when she came to open the window I could always, without once being wrong, expect to see the same patch of sunlight folded in the corner of the outer wall, of an unalterable colour which was less moving as a sign of summer than depressing as the colour of a lifeless and composed enamel. And after Françoise had removed her pins from the mouldings of the window–frame, taken down her various cloths, and drawn back the curtains, the summer day which she disclosed seemed as dead, as immemorially ancient as would have been a sumptuously attired dynastic mummy from which our old servant had done no more than precautionally unwind the linen wrappings before displaying it to my gaze, embalmed in its vesture of gold.","I knew that my gang of girls were already out there on the esplanade, but I could not see them as they walked past the uneven ranges of the sea, beyond which, perched amid its bluish peaks like an Italian hilltop village, the little town of Rivebelle appeared in an occasional sunny glimpse, vivid and detailed. I could not see the girls: but as the shouts of the newspaper-boys – ‘Those journalists,’ as Françoise called them – floated up to my belvedere, along with the cries of bathers and children at their play, punctuating the quiet breaking of the waves along the shore like the calls of the sea-birds, I could imagine their presence and hear their laughter, lapping like the laughter of Nereids among the gentle hush of tide-swell that rose to my ears. ‘We stopped to see whether you were going to come down, Albertine would say that evening, but your shutters were still closed, even after the concert started.’ The concert always broke out at ten o’clock, under my windows. If the tide was in, one’s ear caught the smooth legato of a wave sliding in among the instruments, blending the tones of the violin into its own ripples of crystal and splashing its foam all over the broken echoes of underwater melodies. My things had not been laid out, and the impossibility of getting up and dressing began to make me lose patience. Then the clock struck twelve and at last Françoise came up. For months on end, in Balbec, the place I had so yearned to visit because my imagination had lashed it with gales and shrouded it in fog, the summer weather had been so unvaryingly bright that whenever Françoise came in to open my window, my expectation, never wavering and never disappointed, had been to see the same expanse of sunlight folded into the angle of the outside wall, so unchanging in its colour as to be not so much a thrilling indicator of summer, but rather a drab enamel, inert and artificial. And as Françoise pulled her pins out of the transom and peeled off the extra layers of cloth, then drew back the curtains, the summer’s day that she uncovered seemed as dead and immemorial as a mummy, magnificent and millennial, carefully divested by our old servant of all its wrappings and laid bare, embalmed in its vestments of gold."
"Et sans doute les premiers temps avait-il pensé, dans la solitude même, avec plaisir que, par le moyen de ses œuvres, il s’adressait à distance, il donnait une plus haute idée de lui, à ceux qui l’avaient méconnu ou froissé. Peut-être alors vécut-il seul, non par indifférence, mais par amour des autres, et, comme j’avais renoncé à Gilberte pour lui réapparaître un jour sous des couleurs plus aimables, destinait-il son œuvre à certains, comme un retour vers eux, où sans le revoir lui-même, on l’aimerait, on l’admirerait, on s’entretiendrait de lui ; un renoncement n’est pas toujours total dès le début, quand nous le décidons avec notre âme ancienne et avant que par réaction il n’ait agi sur nous, qu’il s’agisse du renoncement d’un malade, d’un moine, d’un artiste, d’un héros. Mais s’il avait voulu produire en vue de quelques personnes, en produisant, lui avait vécu pour lui-même, loin de la société à laquelle il était indifférent ; la pratique de la solitude lui en avait donné l’amour comme il arrive pour toute grande chose que nous avons crainte d’abord, parce que nous la savions incompatible avec de plus petites auxquelles nous tenions et dont elle nous prive moins qu’elle ne nous détache. Avant de la connaître, toute notre préoccupation est de savoir dans quelle mesure nous pourrons la concilier avec certains plaisirs qui cessent d’en être dès que nous l’avons connue.","And no doubt in the early days he had thought, even in solitude, with pleasure that, by means of his works, he was addressing himself from a distance, he was giving a higher idea of himself to those who had misunderstood him. or crumpled. Perhaps then he lived alone, not out of indifference, but out of love for others, and, as I had given up on Gilberte to reappear to him one day under more pleasant colours, he intended his work for certain people, as a return towards them, where without seeing him again himself, we would love him, we would admire him, we would talk about him; a renunciation is not always total from the start, when we decide it with our old soul and before by reaction it has acted on us, whether it is a question of the renunciation of a sick person, of a monk , an artist, a hero. But if he had wanted to produce for a few people, while producing, he had lived for himself, far from the society to which he was indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with all great things that we fear at first, because we knew it was incompatible with smaller ones that we held dear and of which it deprives us less than it does. detaches us. Before knowing it, all our concern is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be as soon as we have known it.","And no doubt at first he had thought, even in his solitude, with enjoyment that, thanks to his work, he was addressing, in spite of distance, he was giving a loftier idea of himself, to those who had misunderstood or hurt him. Perhaps, in those days, he lived alone not from indifference but from love of his fellows, and, just as I had renounced Gilberte to appear to her again one day in more attractive colours, dedicated his work to certain people as a way of approaching them again, by which without actually seeing him they would be made to love him, admire him, talk about him; a renunciation is not always complete from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from the society to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we knew it to be incompatible with smaller things to which we clung, and of which it does not so much deprive us as it detaches us from them. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it.","To begin with, even in his solitude, he must have taken pleasure in the thought that, through his works, he was addressing, albeit at a remove, those who had misunderstood or offended him, and giving them a better opinion of himself. Perhaps his choice of the solitary life was motivated not by indifference towards others, but by love for them; and, much as I had given up Gilberte in the hope of being able to appear to her in the future in a more lovable guise, perhaps he painted with certain people in mind, in a sort of gesture of reconciliation towards them, so that, without ever meeting again, they would love him, admire him, speak about him; renunciation is not always total from the very first moment – the self which commits us to it is a former self, one which has not yet been acted upon by the fact of renunciation itself, whether it be the renunciation of the invalid, the monk, the artist or the hero. However, even if Elstir’s intention had been to work with a view to impressing certain people, in working he had lived only for himself, turning his back on the society to which he had become indifferent: the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, which is what happens with any important thing that we have ever begun by fearing, because we knew it was incompatible with pettier things to which we were attached, and from which it must sever us for ever, rather than just distract us from them. Before we have committed ourselves to it, our whole concern is to know how we may be able to reconcile it with certain pleasures, which will cease being pleasures as soon as we have experience of it."
"Ma grand-mère, à qui j’avais raconté mon entrevue avec Elstir et qui se réjouissait de tout le profit intellectuel que je pouvais tirer de son amitié, trouvait absurde et peu gentil que je ne fusse pas encore allé lui faire une visite. Mais je ne pensais qu’à la petite bande, et incertain de l’heure où ces jeunes filles passeraient sur la digue, je n’osais pas m’éloigner. Ma grand-mère s’étonnait aussi de mon élégance, car je m’étais soudain souvenu des costumes que j’avais jusqu’ici laissés au fond de ma malle. J’en mettais chaque jour un différent, et j’avais même écrit à Paris pour me faire envoyer de nouveaux chapeaux, et de nouvelles cravates.","My grandmother, to whom I had related my interview with Elstir and who was delighted with all the intellectual profit that I could draw from his friendship, thought it absurd and unkind that I had not yet gone to pay him a visit. But I thought only of the little band, and uncertain of the hour when these young girls would pass on the dyke, I dared not go away. My grandmother was also surprised at my elegance, because I had suddenly remembered the costumes that I had so far left at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and I had even written to Paris to have new hats and new ties sent to me.","My grandmother, who had been told of my meeting with Elstir, and rejoiced at the thought of all the intellectual profit that I might derive from his friendship, considered it absurd and none too polite of me not to have gone yet to pay him a visit. But I could think only of the little band, and being uncertain of the hour at which the girls would be passing along the front, I dared not absent myself. My grandmother was astonished, too, at the smartness of my attire, for I had suddenly remembered suits which had been lying all this time at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and had even written to Paris ordering new hats and neckties.","My grandmother, whom I had told of my encounter with Elstir, and who was pleased to think of all the intellectual advantage there could be for me in the friendship of such a man, thought I was absurd and impolite not to have gone and visited him before this. But I could think of nothing other than the little band of girls; and unsure as I was of when they might appear, I did not dare to leave the esplanade. My grandmother was also surprised at how elegantly I dressed, as I had suddenly remembered suits which till then had remained in my trunk. Now I wore a different one every day and had even written to Paris to ask for new hats and ties to be sent down."
"– Oh ! Monsieur, dis-je à M. de Norpois, quand il m’annonça qu’il ferait part à Gilberte et à sa mère de l’admiration que j’avais pour elles, si vous faisiez cela, si vous parliez de moi à Mme Swann, ce ne serait pas assez de toute ma vie pour vous témoigner ma gratitude, et cette vie vous appartiendrait ! Mais je tiens à vous faire remarquer que je ne connais pas Mme Swann et que je ne lui ai jamais été présenté.","- Oh ! Sir, I said to M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would tell Gilberte and her mother of the admiration I had for them, if you did that, if you spoke of me to Madame Swann, my whole life would not be enough to express my gratitude to you, and this life would belong to you! But I want to point out to you that I do not know Madame Swann and that I have never been introduced to her.","""Oh, sir,"" I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, ""if you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been introduced to her.""","‘Oh, if you would do that, sir,’ I exclaimed to M. de Norpois when he said he would mention to Gilberte and Mme Swann my admiration for them, ‘if you did mention me to Mme Swann, I would be indebted to you for life – my life would be yours! However, I should just point out that I don’t know Mme Swann and have never been introduced to her.’"
"Mais c’était encore trop que celui-ci me fût rappelé. Son souvenir risquait d’entretenir le peu qui subsistait de mon amour pour Gilberte. Aussi, bien que je ne souffrisse plus du tout durant ces visites à Mme Swann, je les espaçai encore et cherchai à la voir le moins possible. Tout au plus, comme je continuais à ne pas quitter Paris, me concédai-je certaines promenades avec elle. Les beaux jours étaient enfin revenus, et la chaleur. Comme je savais qu’avant le déjeuner Mme Swann sortait pendant une heure et allait faire quelques pas avenue du Bois, près de l’Étoile, et de l’endroit qu’on appelait alors, à cause des gens qui venaient regarder les riches qu’ils ne connaissaient que de nom, « Club des Pannés », j’obtins de mes parents que le dimanche – car je n’étais pas libre en semaine à cette heure-là – je pourrais ne déjeuner que bien après eux, à une heure un quart, et aller faire un tour auparavant. Je n’y manquai jamais pendant ce mois de mai, Gilberte étant allée à la campagne chez des amies. J’arrivais à l’Arc-de-Triomphe vers midi. Je faisais le guet à l’entrée de l’avenue, ne perdant pas des yeux le coin de la petite rue par où Mme Swann, qui n’avait que quelques mètres à franchir, venait de chez elle. Comme c’était déjà l’heure où beaucoup de promeneurs rentraient déjeuner, ceux qui restaient étaient peu nombreux et, pour la plus grande part, des gens élégants. Tout d’un coup, sur le sable de l’allée, tardive, alentie et luxuriante comme la plus belle fleur et qui ne s’ouvrirait qu’à midi, Mme Swann apparaissait, épanouissant autour d’elle une toilette toujours différente mais que je me rappelle surtout mauve ; puis elle hissait et déployait sur un long pédoncule, au moment de sa plus complète irradiation, le pavillon de soie d’une large ombrelle de la même nuance que l’effeuillaison des pétales de sa robe. Toute une suite l’environnait ; Swann, quatre ou cinq hommes de club qui étaient venus la voir le matin chez elle ou qu’elle avait rencontrés : et leur noire ou grise agglomération obéissante, exécutant les mouvements presque mécaniques d’un cadre inerte autour d’Odette, donnait l’air à cette femme, qui seule avait de l’intensité dans les yeux, de regarder devant elle, d’entre tous ces hommes, comme d’une fenêtre dont elle se fût approchée, et la faisait surgir, frêle, sans crainte, dans la nudité de ses tendres couleurs, comme l’apparition d’un être d’une espèce différente, d’une race inconnue, et d’une puissance presque guerrière, grâce à quoi elle compensait à elle seule sa multiple escorte. Souriante, heureuse du beau temps, du soleil qui n’incommodait pas encore, ayant l’air d’assurance et de calme du créateur qui a accompli son œuvre et ne se soucie plus du reste, certaine que sa toilette – dussent des passants vulgaires ne pas l’apprécier – était la plus élégante de toutes, elle la portait pour soi-même et pour ses amis, naturellement, sans attention exagérée, mais aussi sans détachement complet ; n’empêchant pas les petits nœuds de son corsage et de sa jupe de flotter légèrement devant elle comme des créatures dont elle n’ignorait pas la présence et à qui elle permettait avec indulgence de se livrer à leurs jeux, selon leur rythme propre, pourvu qu’ils suivissent sa marche, et même sur son ombrelle mauve que souvent elle tenait encore fermée quand elle arrivait, elle laissait tomber par moment, comme sur un bouquet de violettes de Parme, son regard heureux et si doux que quand il ne s’attachait plus à ses amis, mais à un objet inanimé, il avait l’air de sourire encore. Elle réservait ainsi, elle faisait occuper à sa toilette cet intervalle d’élégance dont les hommes à qui Mme Swann parlait le plus en camarade respectaient l’espace et la nécessité, non sans une certaine déférence de profanes, un aveu de leur propre ignorance, et sur lequel ils reconnaissaient à leur amie comme à un malade sur les soins spéciaux qu’il doit prendre, ou comme à une mère sur l’éducation de ses enfants, compétence et juridiction. Non moins que par la cour qui l’entourait et ne semblait pas voir les passants, Mme Swann, à cause de l’heure tardive de son apparition, évoquait cet appartement où elle avait passé une matinée si longue et où il faudrait qu’elle rentrât bientôt déjeuner ; elle semblait en indiquer la proximité par la tranquillité flâneuse de sa promenade, pareille à celle qu’on fait à petits pas dans son jardin ; de cet appartement on aurait dit qu’elle portait encore autour d’elle l’ombre intérieure et fraîche. Mais, par tout cela même, sa vue ne me donnait que davantage la sensation du plein air et de la chaleur. D’autant plus que déjà persuadé qu’en vertu de la liturgie et des rites dans lesquels Mme Swann était profondément versée, sa toilette était unie à la saison et à l’heure par un lien nécessaire, unique, les fleurs de son inflexible chapeau de paille, les petits rubans de sa robe me semblaient naître du mois de mai plus naturellement encore que les fleurs des jardins et des bois ; et pour connaître le trouble nouveau de la saison, je ne levais pas les yeux plus haut que son ombrelle, ouverte et tendue comme un autre ciel plus proche, rond, clément, mobile et bleu. Car ces rites, s’ils étaient souverains, mettaient leur gloire, et par conséquent Mme Swann mettait la sienne à obéir avec condescendance au matin, au printemps, au soleil, lesquels ne me semblaient pas assez flattés qu’une femme si élégante voulût bien ne pas les ignorer et eût choisi à cause d’eux une robe d’une étoffe plus claire, plus légère, faisant penser, par son évasement au col et aux manches, à la moiteur du cou et des poignets, fît enfin pour eux tous les frais d’une grande dame qui s’étant gaiement abaissée à aller voir à la campagne des gens communs et que tout le monde, même le vulgaire, connaît, n’en a pas moins tenu à revêtir spécialement pour ce jour-là une toilette champêtre. Dès son arrivée, je saluais Mme Swann, elle m’arrêtait et me disait : « Good morning » en souriant. Nous faisions quelques pas. Et je comprenais que ces canons selon lesquels elle s’habillait, c’était pour elle-même qu’elle y obéissait, comme à une sagesse supérieure dont elle eût été la grande prêtresse : car s’il lui arrivait qu’ayant trop chaud, elle entr’ouvrît, ou même ôtât, tout à fait et me donnât à porter sa jaquette qu’elle avait cru garder fermée, je découvrais dans la chemisette mille détails d’exécution qui avaient eu grande chance de rester inaperçus comme ces parties d’orchestre auxquelles le compositeur a donné tous ses soins, bien qu’elles ne doivent jamais arriver aux oreilles du public ; ou dans les manches de la jaquette pliée sur mon bras je voyais, je regardais longuement, par plaisir ou par amabilité, quelque détail exquis, une bande d’une teinte délicieuse, une satinette mauve habituellement cachée aux yeux de tous, mais aussi délicatement travaillée que les parties extérieures, comme ces sculptures gothiques d’une cathédrale dissimulées au revers d’une balustrade à quatre-vingts pieds de hauteur, aussi parfaites que les bas-reliefs du grand porche, mais que personne n’avait jamais vues avant qu’au hasard d’un voyage, un artiste n’eût obtenu de monter se promener en plein ciel, pour dominer toute la ville, entre les deux tours.","But it was still too much for me to be reminded of this one. The memory of her risked sustaining the little that remained of my love for Gilberte. So, although I no longer suffered at all during these visits to Madame Swann, I still spaced them out and tried to see her as little as possible. At most, as I continued not to leave Paris, I allowed myself certain walks with her. The sunny days had finally returned, and the heat. As I knew that before lunch Mme. he only knew the name ""Club des Pannés"", I got from my parents that on Sundays - because I was not free during the week at that time - I could have lunch only long after them, at a quarter past, and go for a walk before. I never missed it during the month of May, Gilberte having gone to the country to see some friends. I arrived at the Arc-de-Triomphe around noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the avenue, not losing sight of the corner of the little street by which Madame Swann, who had only a few yards to cross, came from her house. As it was already the hour when many strollers returned to lunch, those who remained were few and, for the most part, elegant people. Suddenly, on the sand of the alley, belated, slow and luxuriant like the most beautiful flower and which would not open until noon, Madame Swann appeared, blooming around her a dress always different but which I especially remember mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled on a long peduncle, at the moment of its most complete irradiation, the silk flag of a large parasol of the same shade as the leaves of the petals of her dress. A whole retinue surrounded him; Swann, four or five club men who had come to see her in the morning at her house or whom she had met: and their obedient black or gray agglomeration, executing the almost mechanical movements of an inert frame around Odette, gave the look to this woman, who alone had intensity in her eyes, to look before her, among all these men, as if from a window which she had approached, and made her emerge, frail, without fear, in the bareness of her tender colors, like the appearance of a being of a different species, of an unknown race, and of an almost warlike power, thanks to which she alone compensated for her multiple escort. Smiling, happy with the fine weather, the sun which was not yet inconvenient, with the confident and calm air of the creator who has accomplished his work and no longer cares about the rest, certain that his toilet - say vulgar passers-by not to appreciate it – was the most elegant of all, she wore it for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention, but also without complete detachment; not preventing the little knots of her bodice and her skirt from floating lightly in front of her like creatures whose presence she was not unaware of and whom she allowed with indulgence to indulge in their games, according to their own rhythm, provided let them follow her walk, and even on her mauve parasol which she often still kept closed when she arrived, she let fall from time to time, as on a bouquet of Parma violets, her look, happy and so gentle as when it did not was more attached to his friends, but to an inanimate object, he seemed to still be smiling. She reserved in this way, she caused her toilet to occupy that interval of elegance whose space and necessity the men to whom Madame Swann spoke most as a comrade respected, not without a certain deference of the profane, an admission of their own ignorance, and on which they acknowledged to their friend as to a sick person on the special care he must take, or as to a mother on the education of her children, competence and jurisdiction. No less than by the courtyard which surrounded her and did not seem to see the passers-by, Mme Swann, because of the late hour of her appearance, evoked this apartment where she had spent such a long morning and where she would have to would soon be home for lunch; she seemed to indicate its proximity by the leisurely tranquility of her stroll, like that which one takes with short steps in one's garden; from this apartment one would have said that she still carried around her the interior and cool shadow. But, by all this, the sight of him only gave me more the feeling of the open air and the warmth. Especially since already convinced that by virtue of the liturgy and the rites in which Mme Swann was deeply versed, her toilet was united to the season and to the hour by a necessary, unique link, the flowers of her inflexible hat of straw, the little ribbons of her dress seemed to me to be born of the month of May even more naturally than the flowers of the gardens and the woods; and to know the new trouble of the season, I did not raise my eyes higher than its parasol, open and tense like another sky closer, round, clement, mobile and blue. For these rites, if they were sovereign, put their glory, and consequently Madame Swann put hers to obey with condescension the morning, the spring, the sun, which did not seem to me sufficiently not ignore them and would have chosen because of them a dress of a lighter, lighter fabric, reminiscent, by its flare at the collar and sleeves, of the clammy neck and wrists, finally made for them all the expense of a great lady who, having cheerfully stooped to go and see common people in the country and whom everyone, even the vulgar, knows, nevertheless made a point of donning a dress especially for that day. country toilet. As soon as she arrived, I greeted Mrs. Swann, she stopped me and said to me: “Good morning” with a smile. We took a few steps. And I understood that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for herself that she obeyed them, as if to a superior wisdom of which she would have been the high priestess: for if it happened to her that, being too hot , she half opened, or even took off, completely and gave me to wear her jacket which she had thought to keep closed, I discovered in the shirt a thousand details of execution which had had a good chance of remaining unnoticed like these parts of orchestra to which the composer gave all his care, although they should never reach the ears of the public; or in the sleeves of the jacket folded over my arm I saw, I gazed for a long time, for pleasure or kindness, some exquisite detail, a band of a delicious hue, a mauve sateen usually hidden from view, but also delicately worked that the exterior parts, like those gothic carvings of a cathedral concealed behind an eighty-foot-high balustrade, as perfect as the bas-reliefs of the great porch, but which no one had ever seen before by chance on a trip, an artist would not have obtained permission to go up for a walk in the open sky, to dominate the whole city, between the two towers.","But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile—a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the 'swells' whom they knew only by name, was known as the 'Shabby–Genteel Club'—I persuaded my parents, on Sundays ( for on weekdays I was busy all morning), to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side–street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, luxuriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes—even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them—were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet 'put up' when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had (as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children's education) a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe' the passers–by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one's own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique , I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby–ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory (and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own) in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed,—in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say (in English) ' Good morning,' and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up , I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas–reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers.","But even the memory of the little path was almost too much. The danger of it was that it might keep alive in me the remaining vestige of my love for Gilberte. So, despite the fact that my visits to Mme Swann now caused me no grief at all, I made them even more infrequent, trying to see her as little as possible. I did allow myself, since I persisted in not leaving Paris, to walk with her a few times. Fine warm weather had at last arrived. Knowing that Mme Swann went out each day before lunch and took a short walk in the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, not far from the Arc de Triomphe, quite close to the spot which was known in those days, in honour of the citizenry who went there to see all the rich people they had heard of, as the ‘Hard-up Club’, I had asked my parents’ permission to go out for a walk late on Sunday mornings (not being free on weekdays at that time) and not to come back to lunch till a quarter-past one, which was much later than their own lunch-time. During that month of May, I did not miss a single Sunday, Gilberte having gone off to spend some time in the country with friends. I would arrive at the Arc de Triomphe about midday and stand at the end of the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, from where I could watch the corner of the side-street from which Mme Swann would emerge, coming from her house, which was only a few steps away. It was the hour at which many of those who had been out for a walk were going home to lunch; of the few remaining, most belonged to fashionable society. Then it was, stepping on to the fine gravel of the avenue, that Mme Swann would make her entrance, as late, languid and luxuriant as the most beautiful flower that never opens until noon, in outfits which gave her a bloom of radiance, and which, though they were always different, I remember as mainly mauve. The bright moment of her flowering was complete when, on an elongated stretch of stem, she unfurled the silky vexillum of a broad sunshade blending with the full-blown shimmer of her frock. She was accompanied by a whole retinue: Swann was there, as were four or five other club-men who had either dropped in to see her that morning or whom she had just encountered. And as the blacks and greys of this disciplined formation executed their almost mechanical movements, lending an inert frame to Odette, they made the woman, the only one with any intensity in her gaze, appear to be staring past them all, looking straight ahead as though leaning out of a window, and made her stand out, fragile and fearless, in the nudity of her gentle colours, as though she was a creature of a different species or of some mysterious descent, with a suggestion of something warlike about her, all of which enabled her single person to counter-balance her numerous escort. Beaming with smiles, contented with the lovely day and the sunshine, which was not yet too warm, with all the poise and confidence of a creator who beholds every thing that he has made and sees it is very good, and knowing (though vulgar passers-by might not appreciate this) that her outfit was more elegant than anyone else ’s , she wore it for herself but also for her friends, naturally, without show but also without complete indifference, not objecting if the light bows on her bodice and skirt drifted slightly in front of her, like pets whose presence she was aware of but whose caprices she indulged, leaving them to their own devices as long as they stayed close to her; and as though her purple parasol, often furled when she first emerged into the avenue, was a posy of Parma violets, it too at times received from her happy eyes a glance which, though directed not at her friends but at an inanimate object, brimmed with so much gentle good-will that it still seemed to be a smile. A margin of elegance, which Mme Swann’s choice of outfit made all her own, was accepted as her essential and exclusive prerogative by the gentlemen whom she addressed most familiarly; and in this they deferred to her with the air of ignorant outsiders who do not mind recognizing themselves as such, conceding the aptness of her authority, as they might with an invalid on the matter of the special care he must take, or with a mother on how best to bring up her children. It was not just this suite of retainers, surrounding her and seeming not to notice passers-by, that suggested Mme Swann’s indoor life: by reason of the lateness of her advent in the avenue , she brought to mind the house in which she had spent long morning hours, where she would soon have to return for lunch; the proximity of it was in the calm and leisured simplicity of her manner, as though she was strolling down her own garden path; the cool subdued light of its interior seemed to hang about her as she passed. But this vision of her only gave me a heightened sense of the fresh air and the warmth of the day, especially since (in my conviction that, in accordance with her pious expertise in the rites and liturgy of such things, Mme Swann’s ways of dressing were linked to the season and the time of day by a bond that was necessary and unique) the flowers on her soft straw hat and the little bows on her frock seemed a more natural product of May than any flowers cultivated in beds or growing wild in the woods; and to witness the thrilling onset of the new season, I needed to lift my eyes no higher than Mme Swann’s sunshade, opened now and stretched above me like a nearer, more temperate sky, full of its constantly changing blue. Though subordinate to none, these rites were honour-bound, as was consequently Mme Swann herself, to defer to the morning, the springtime and the sunshine, none of which I ever thought seemed flattered enough that such an elegant woman should make a point of respecting them, of choosing for their pleasure a frock in a brighter or lighter material, its lower neckline and looser sleeves suggesting the moist warmth of the throat and the wrists, that she should treat them as a great lady treats the common people whose invitation to visit them in the country she has cheerfully condescended to accept, and for whose special occasion, though they are nobodies, she makes a point of giving her dress a bucolic touch. As soon as she appeared, I made my bow to Mme Swann; she paused with me and gave me her smiling English ‘Good morning!’ As we strolled, I realized that it was for her own sake that she observed these standards in dress, as though they were the tenets of a superior form of worship, which she merely served as a high priestess; for if she felt too warm, if she unbuttoned or even took off and asked me to carry the jacket that she had originally meant to keep buttoned, I discovered in the blouse she wore under it a host of details of handiwork which might well never have been noticed, after the manner of those orchestral parts which the composer has worked with exquisite care, although no ears among the audience will ever hear them; or else in the sleeves folded over my arm I picked out and studied, for the pleasure of looking at them or for the pleasure of being pleasant, this or that tiny detail, a strip of cloth of a delightful shade, or a mauve satinet normally unseen by any eye, but just as delicately finished as any of the outer parts of the garment, like the fine Gothic stonework hidden eighty feet up a cathedral, on the inner face of a balustrade, just as perfectly executed as the low-relief statues in the main doorway, but which no one had ever set eyes on until an artist on a chance visit to the city asked to be allowed to climb up there, walk about at sky-level and survey a whole townscape from between the twin steeples."
"– Je ne te dis pas, mais nous ne sommes pas obligés de faire exactement de même en tout. Moi je ferai d’autres amabilités à Gilberte que Mme Swann n’aura pas pour toi.","– I'm not telling you, but we don't have to do exactly the same in everything. I will do other kindnesses to Gilberte that Madame Swann will not have for you.","""I never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.""",But we’re not obliged to be exactly the same as each other. I can be nice to Gilberte in ways which are different from the ways her mother is nice to you.’
"– Somme toute, continua M. de Norpois en s’adressant à mon père, Vaugoubert s’est taillé là un beau succès et qui dépasse même celui qu’il avait escompté. Il s’attendait en effet à un toast correct (ce qui après les nuages des dernières années était déjà fort beau) mais à rien de plus. Plusieurs personnes qui étaient au nombre des assistants m’ont assuré qu’on ne peut pas en lisant ce toast se rendre compte de l’effet qu’il a produit, prononcé et détaillé à merveille par le roi qui est maître en l’art de dire et qui soulignait au passage toutes les intentions, toutes les finesses. Je me suis laissé raconter à ce propos un fait assez piquant et qui met en relief une fois de plus chez le roi Théodose cette bonne grâce juvénile qui lui gagne si bien les cœurs. On m’a affirmé que précisément à ce mot d’« affinités » qui était en somme la grosse innovation du discours, et qui défraiera, encore longtemps vous verrez, les commentaires des chancelleries, Sa Majesté, prévoyant la joie de notre ambassadeur, qui allait trouver là le juste couronnement de ses efforts, de son rêve pourrait-on dire et, somme toute, son bâton de maréchal, se tourna à demi vers Vaugoubert et fixant sur lui ce regard si prenant des Oettingen, détacha ce mot si bien choisi d’« affinités », ce mot qui était une véritable trouvaille sur un ton qui faisait savoir à tous qu’il était employé à bon escient et en pleine connaissance de cause. Il paraît que Vaugoubert avait peine à maîtriser son émotion et, dans une certaine mesure, j’avoue que je le comprends. Une personne digne de toute créance m’a même confié que le roi se serait approché de Vaugoubert après le dîner, quand Sa Majesté a tenu cercle, et lui aurait dit à mi-voix : « Êtes-vous content de votre élève, mon cher marquis ? »","""All in all,"" continued M. de Norpois, addressing my father, ""Vaugoubert has carved out a fine success for himself there, and one which exceeds even that which he had expected. He was indeed expecting a decent toast (which after the clouds of the last few years was already very nice) but nothing more. Several people who were among the assistants assured me that one cannot read this toast to realize the effect it produced, pronounced and marvelously detailed by the king who is a master in the art to say and which underlined in passing all the intentions, all the subtleties. I have allowed myself to be told in this connection a rather piquant fact which once again highlights in King Theodosius that good youthful grace which won him hearts so well. I have been told that precisely at this word ""affinities"" which was in short the great innovation of the speech, and which will defray, for a long time to come, you will see, the comments of the chancelleries, His Majesty, foreseeing the joy of our ambassador, who was going to find there the just crowning of his efforts, of his dream one might say and, all in all, his marshal's baton, half-turned towards Vaugoubert and fixing on him that gaze so captivating of the Oettingen, detached this word so well chosen of ""affinities"", this word which was a real find in a tone that let everyone know that it was used wisely and with full knowledge of the facts. It seems that Vaugoubert had difficulty in controlling his emotion and, to a certain extent, I admit that I understand him. A person worthy of all credence even confided to me that the King would have approached Vaugoubert after dinner, when His Majesty held a circle, and would have said to him in an undertone: ""Are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear marquis? »","""In short,"" M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, ""Vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He expected, you understand, a correctly worded speech (which, after the storm–clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good) but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered—when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this connexion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theodosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word 'affinities,' which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal's baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word 'affinities,' a positive treasure–trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain extent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, 'Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?'","‘As a matter of fact, M. de Norpois went on, talking to my father, Vaugoubert has made a great success of this, one which really goes further than he had been hoping. He had expected a formal toast, nothing more, which, given the coldness of recent years, would actually have been a good sign. Several people who were among those present have assured me that, if one merely reads the text of the toast, it is not possible to realize the effect which it had when it was proposed and so brilliantly expounded by the King, who, being the master he is in the art of public speaking, brought out so well each and every intent, each and every shade of it. In that connection, a rather choice detail has been brought to my attention, one which shows to advantage, yet again, the youthful good-heartedness which so many find endearing in King Theodosius. I have been assured that at the very moment when he spoke that word “affinities”, which was after all the great novelty of the speech, one which, mark my words, will lend itself to much comment in the chancelleries, His Majesty, foreseeing the joy it would cause our ambassador, who would see it as the fulfilment of his every effort, the realization of his dream, one might say, in a word his marshal’s baton, His Majesty half-turned towards Vaugoubert, rested that engaging eye of the Oettingens on him and carefully enunciated that word “affinities”, so well chosen, such a felicitous expression, in a tone of voice which let everyone know it was being used quite deliberately and with intent. It appears that Vaugoubert was quite unmanned for a moment; and I must say that, to a certain extent, I sympathize with him. After the banquet, when His Majesty had gathered about him a more restricted circle – I have this from a person whose word is utterly unimpeachable, you understand – it is said the King even approached Vaugoubert and murmured to him, “Well, Marquis, are you satisfied with your pupil?”"
"– Qui dépare tout de même la façade de Gabriel, répondit M. de Charlus. Évidemment ce serait maintenant une sauvagerie que de détruire le Hameau. Mais quel que soit l’esprit du jour, je doute tout de même qu’à cet égard une fantaisie de Mme Israël ait le même prestige que le souvenir de la Reine.","""Which marred Gabriel's facade all the same,"" replied M. de Charlus. Obviously it would now be savagery to destroy the Hamlet. But whatever the spirit of the day, I doubt all the same that in this respect a fantasy of Mme Israel has the same prestige as the memory of the Queen.","""Which, all the same, ruins Gabriel's front,"" replied M. de Charlus. ""Obviously, it would be an act of vandalism now to destroy the Hameau. But whatever may be the spirit of the age, I doubt, all the same, whether, in that respect, a whim of Mme. Israel has the same importance as the memory of the Queen.""","– Yes, said M. de Charlus. And it completely spoils the façade, which is by Gabriel. Obviously it would be an act of barbarism if anyone were nowadays to raze Marie-Antoinette’s English cottages. But whichever fad each day may bring, I do find it difficult to believe that a passing fancy of a Mme Israel could have the same value as a memento of the Queen.’"

Where could Madame Swann have fished out all these people?""","""The astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?""","– Isn’t it remarkable that he dined at the Swanns’, though? And that the people he met there are really quite normal, I mean civil service types. Where on earth can Mme Swann have dug up people like that, I wonder?"
"Sans doute eut-il regret de ces paroles, car quelque temps après je reçus – dans une reliure de maroquin sur le plat de laquelle avait été encastrée une plaque de cuir incisé qui représentait en demi-relief une branche de myosotis – le livre qu’il m’avait prêté et que je lui avais fait remettre, non par Aimé qui se trouvait « de sortie », mais par le liftier.","No doubt he regretted these words, because some time later I received – in a morocco binding on the cover of which had been inserted an incised leather plate which represented in half-relief a branch of forget-me-nots – the book which I he had lent it to me and which I had had delivered to him, not by Aimé who happened to be 'out', but by the elevator operator.","No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received—in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi–relief a spray of forget–me–nots—the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aimé who was apparently 'off duty,' but by the lift–boy.","M. de Charlus must have regretted his words, for some time later I received another copy – morocco-bound and with a panel of incised leather on its front cover showing a sprig of forget-me-not in half-relief – of the book which he had lent me and which, it being Aimé’s day off, I had asked the ‘lift’ to take back to him."
"Il fut pris d’une joie dont il ne fut pas plus le maître que d’un état physique qui se produit sans intervention de la volonté, il devint écarlate comme un enfant qu’on vient de punir, et ma grand’mère fut beaucoup plus touchée de voir tous les efforts qu’il avait faits (sans y réussir) pour contenir la joie qui le secouait, que par tous les remerciements qu’il aurait pu proférer. Mais lui, craignant d’avoir mal témoigné sa reconnaissance, me priait encore de l’en excuser, le lendemain, penché à la fenêtre du petit chemin de fer d’intérêt local qu’il prit pour rejoindre sa garnison. Celle-ci était, en effet, très peu éloignée. Il avait pensé s’y rendre, comme il faisait souvent, quand il devait revenir le soir et qu’il ne s’agissait pas d’un départ définitif, en voiture. Mais il eût fallu cette fois-ci qu’il mît ses nombreux bagages dans le train. Et il trouva plus simple d’y monter aussi lui-même, suivant en cela l’avis du directeur qui, consulté, répondit que, voiture ou petit chemin de fer, « ce serait à peu près équivoque ». Il entendait signifier par là que ce serait équivalent (en somme, à peu près ce que Françoise eût exprimé en disant que « cela reviendrait du pareil au même »).","He was seized with a joy of which he was no more the master than with a physical state which is produced without the intervention of the will, he became scarlet like a child who has just been punished, and my grandmother was much more touched to see all the efforts he had made (without success) to contain the joy that shook him, than by all the thanks he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had shown his gratitude badly, again begged me to excuse him the next day, leaning out of the window of the little local railway he took to join his garrison. It was, in fact, very close. He had thought of going there, as he often did, when he had to return in the evening and it was not a question of a definitive departure, by car. But this time he would have had to put his many bags on the train. And he found it easier to get on it himself too, following the advice of the director who, when consulted, replied that, car or small railway, ""it would be almost ambiguous"". He meant by that to mean that it would be equivalent (in short, roughly what Francoise would have expressed by saying that ""it would amount to the same thing"").","He was overpowered by a joy which he could no more control than we can a physical condition that arises without the intervention of our will. He blushed scarlet as a child who has just been whipped, and my grandmother was a great deal more touched to see all the efforts that he was making (without success) to control the joy that convulsed him than she would have been to hear any words of thanks that he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had failed to shew his gratitude properly, begged me to make his excuses to her again, next day, leaning from the window of the little train of the local railway company which was to take him back to his regiment. The distance was, as a matter of fact, nothing. He had thought of going, as he had frequently done that summer, when he was to return the same evening and was not encumbered with luggage, by road. But this time he would have had, anyhow, to put all his heavy luggage in the train. And he found it simpler to take the train himself also, following the advice of the manager who, on being consulted, replied that ""Carriage or train, it was more or less equivocal."" He meant us to understand that they were equivalent (in fact, very much what Françoise would have expressed as ""coming to as near as made no difference"").","Saint-Loup, overjoyed, was no more able to control his reaction than if it had been a bodily state produced without the intervention of the will: he turned scarlet, like a child who has been punished; and my grandmother was much more touched by the sight of all the efforts he made, unsuccessful as they were, to contain the joy that surged through him than by all the thanks he could have expressed. The following day, doubting whether he had shown enough gratitude, he was still asking me to excuse him as he leaned out of the window of the little local train which was to take him back to his garrison, which was not far away. He had originally thought he might drive over, as he often did when he had to return there in the evening, when he was to be away from Balbec for only a short time. But he had so much luggage this time that it would have had to go by train; so he had thought it more convenient to take the train himself, a view confirmed by the manager of the hotel, who, when asked about the respective merits of carriage or train, replied that either of these modes of travel would be ‘more or less equitable to the other’. By which he meant ‘equivalent’, roughly what Françoise would have expressed as ‘it ’s all the same as one or the other’."
"Le 1er janvier me fut particulièrement douloureux cette année-là. Tout l’est sans doute, qui fait date et anniversaire, quand on est malheureux. Mais si c’est par exemple d’avoir perdu un être cher, la souffrance consiste seulement dans une comparaison plus vive avec le passé. Il s’y ajoutait dans mon cas l’espoir informulé que Gilberte, ayant voulu me laisser l’initiative des premiers pas et constatant que je ne les avais pas faits, n’avait attendu que le prétexte du 1er janvier pour m’écrire : « Enfin, qu’y a-t-il ? je suis folle de vous, venez que nous nous expliquions franchement, je ne peux pas vivre sans vous voir. » Dès les derniers jours de l’année cette lettre me parut probable. Elle ne l’était peut-être pas, mais, pour que nous la croyions telle, le désir, le besoin que nous en avons suffit. Le soldat est persuadé qu’un certain délai indéfiniment prolongeable lui sera accordé avant qu’il soit tué, le voleur avant qu’il soit pris, les hommes en général avant qu’ils aient à mourir. C’est là l’amulette qui préserve les individus – et parfois les peuples – non du danger mais de la peur du danger, en réalité de la croyance au danger, ce qui dans certains cas permet de les braver sans qu’il soit besoin d’être brave. Une confiance de ce genre, et aussi peu fondée, soutient l’amoureux qui compte sur une réconciliation, sur une lettre. Pour que je n’eusse pas attendu celle-là, il eût suffi que j’eusse cessé de la souhaiter. Si indifférent qu’on sache que l’on est à celle qu’on aime encore, on lui prête une série de pensées – fussent-elles d’indifférence – une intention de les manifester, une complication de vie intérieure, où l’on est l’objet peut-être d’une antipathie, mais aussi d’une attention permanentes. Pour imaginer au contraire ce qui se passait en Gilberte, il eût fallu que je pusse tout simplement anticiper dès ce 1er janvier-là ce que j’eusse ressenti celui d’une des années suivantes, et où l’attention, ou le silence, ou la tendresse, ou la froideur de Gilberte eussent passé à peu près inaperçus à mes yeux et où je n’eusse pas songé, pas même pu songer à chercher la solution de problèmes qui auraient cessé de se poser pour moi. Quand on aime, l’amour est trop grand pour pouvoir être contenu tout entier en nous ; il irradie vers la personne aimée, rencontre en elle une surface qui l’arrête, le force à revenir vers son point de départ ; et c’est ce choc en retour de notre propre tendresse que nous appelons les sentiments de l’autre et qui nous charme plus qu’à l’aller, parce que nous ne connaissons pas qu’elle vient de nous. Le 1er janvier sonna toutes ses heures sans qu’arrivât cette lettre de Gilberte. Et comme j’en reçus quelques-unes de vœux tardifs ou retardés par l’encombrement des courriers à ces dates-là, le 3 et le 4 janvier, j’espérais encore, de moins en moins pourtant. Les jours qui suivirent, je pleurai beaucoup. Certes cela tenait à ce qu’ayant été moins sincère que je ne l’avais cru quand j’avais renoncé à Gilberte, j’avais gardé cet espoir d’une lettre d’elle pour la nouvelle année. Et le voyant épuisé avant que j’eusse eu le temps de me précautionner d’un autre, je souffrais comme un malade qui a vidé sa fiole de morphine sans en avoir sous la main une seconde. Mais peut-être en moi – et ces deux explications ne s’excluent pas car un seul sentiment est quelquefois fait de contraires – l’espérance que j’avais de recevoir enfin une lettre, avait-elle rapproché de moi l’image de Gilberte, recréé les émotions que l’attente de me trouver près d’elle, sa vue, sa manière d’être avec moi, me causaient autrefois. La possibilité immédiate d’une réconciliation avait supprimé cette chose de l’énormité de laquelle nous ne nous rendons pas compte : la résignation. Les neurasthéniques ne peuvent croire les gens qui leur assurent qu’ils seront à peu près calmés en restant au lit sans recevoir de lettres, sans lire de journaux. Ils se figurent que ce régime ne fera qu’exaspérer leur nervosité. De même les amoureux, le considérant du sein d’un état contraire, n’ayant pas commencé de l’expérimenter, ne peuvent croire à la puissance bienfaisante du renoncement.","January 1st was particularly painful for me that year. Everything is doubtless, which makes date and anniversary, when one is unhappy. But if it is, for example, to have lost a loved one, the suffering consists only in a more vivid comparison with the past. In my case, there was added the unformulated hope that Gilberte, having wanted to leave me the initiative of the first steps and noting that I had not taken them, had only waited for the pretext of January 1 to write to me: “Finally, what is it? I'm crazy about you, come let us explain ourselves frankly, I can't live without seeing you. From the last days of the year this letter seemed probable to me. It was perhaps not, but for us to believe it such, the desire, the need that we have is enough. The soldier is persuaded that a certain indefinitely extendable delay will be granted to him before he is killed, the thief before he is caught, men in general before they have to die. This is the amulet that preserves individuals – and sometimes peoples – not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to be braved without need. to be brave. A trust of this kind, and just as unfounded, sustains the lover who counts on a reconciliation, on a letter. For me not to have waited for that one, it would have been enough that I had ceased to wish for it. However indifferent we know we are to the one we still love, we lend her a series of thoughts – even if they are of indifference – an intention to manifest them, a complication of inner life, where we is the object perhaps of an antipathy, but also of a permanent attention. To imagine, on the contrary, what was happening in Gilberte, I would have had to be able quite simply to anticipate from that January 1 what I would have felt that of one of the following years, and where attention, or silence, either Gilberte's tenderness or coldness would have passed almost unnoticed in my eyes and where I would not have thought, could not even think of seeking the solution of problems which would have ceased to arise for me. When we love, the love is too great to be contained entirely within us; it radiates towards the loved person, encounters a surface within her that stops it, forces it to return to its starting point; and it is this shock in return of our own tenderness that we call the feelings of the other and which charms us more than on the outward journey, because we do not know that it comes from us. The 1st of January struck all its hours without this letter from Gilberte arriving. And as I received some of them late or delayed by the congestion of the mails on these dates, January 3 and 4, I still hoped, less and less however. The days that followed, I cried a lot. Certainly that was because, having been less sincere than I had thought when I had renounced Gilberte, I had kept this hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing him exhausted before I had time to take care of another, I suffered like a sick man who has emptied his vial of morphine without having a second to hand. But perhaps in me – and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive because a single feeling is sometimes made up of opposites – the hope that I had of finally receiving a letter had brought the image of Gilberte closer to me. , recreated the emotions that the expectation of being near her, her sight, her way of being with me, once caused me. The immediate possibility of reconciliation had taken away that one thing the enormity of which we do not realize: resignation. Neurasthenics cannot believe people who assure them that they will be more or less calm by remaining in bed without receiving letters, without reading newspapers. They figure that this diet will only exasperate their nervousness. Likewise lovers, considering it from the bosom of an opposite state, having not begun to experience it, cannot believe in the beneficial power of renunciation.","The first of January was exceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the unexpressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the excuse of New Year's Day to write to me, saying: ""What is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us explain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you. "" As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people—and sometimes peoples—not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts (though their sum–total be indifference) the intention to express those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte's mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year's Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting–point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other's regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year's Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte , I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope exhausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case—and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements—the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind's eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation.","That New Year’s Day was especially painful. When one is unhappy, anything that serves as a reminder or an anniversary can cause this pain. If it is a reminder, say, of the death of a loved one, the grief comes from the sharpened contrast between present and past. In my position, however, it was aggravated by the unacknowledged hope that Gilberte might have been expecting me to make the first step towards a reconciliation, and that, now it was clear I had not made it, she might have decided to take the opportunity of the New Year, with its exchanges of greetings, to send me a note: ‘Look, what’s the matter? I’m madly in love with you , I can’t live without you, let’s meet and sort it all out.’ By the last days of December, it had come to seem likely that I would receive such a letter. Whether it was really likely or not, our desire for such a letter, our need for it, is enough to make us believe it will probably come. The soldier is convinced that an indefinitely extendable period must elapse before he will be killed, the thief before he will be arrested, all of us before we must die. This is the amulet which protects individuals, and sometimes nations, not from danger, but from the fear of danger, or rather from belief in danger, which can lead to the braving of real dangers by those who are not brave. Such unfounded confidence sustains the lover who looks forward to a reconciliation or a letter. For me to stop expecting one from Gilberte, I would have had to stop wishing for it. Despite knowing one is an object of indifference to a woman one still loves, one fills her mind with imaginary thoughts (though they may amount only to indifference) and an urge to express them, one sees oneself as the focus of her complicated emotional life, albeit possibly only as a source of dislike, but by the same token as an object of her permanent attention. For me to have an inkling of what was in Gilberte’s real mind on that New Year’s Day, I would have had to be able to feel in advance what I would feel on some future New Year’s Day, by which time I would have ignored entirely any notice or lack of notice Gilberte might take of me, any affection or lack of it that she might feel for me, just as I would have become incapable of having the slightest urge to seek solutions to such problems, for they would have long since ceased to be mine. When we are in love, our love is too vast to be wholly contained within ourselves; it radiates outwards, reaches the resistant surface of the loved one, which reflects it back to its starting-point; and this return of our own tenderness is what we see as the other’s feelings, working their new, enhanced charm on us, because we do not recognize them as having originated in ourselves. New Year’s Day chimed its hours one after the other without Gilberte’s letter being delivered. By the 3rd of January, then the 4th, having just received some well-wishers’ cards and letters which had been posted late, or held up in the great rush of New Year mail, I had not given up my hope, although it had begun to fade. On the following days I was often in tears. This meant, of course, that I had held on to the hope of having a New Year letter from Gilberte because, in giving her up, I had not been as sincere as I had thought. That hope having now died, before I had been able to fortify myself with a replacement, I was as distressed as an invalid who has finished his phial of morphine without having another one available. But it may also have meant – the two explanations need not rule each other out; and a single feeling may be made of opposites – that my hope of at last receiving a letter had brought the image of Gilberte closer, recreating in me the feelings which I had once had from looking forward to being with her, from the sight of her and her ways with me. The immediate possibility of being reconciled with her had abolished in me the thing of which we never realize the full enormity: resignation. Neurotics never believe people who assure them that, if they just stay in bed, read no letters and open no newspapers, they will gradually calm down. They foresee that such a regimen can only worsen the state of their nerves. Those in love see renunciation in the same light: they imagine it while living in a state which is its opposite; and never having so much as begun to try it, they cannot believe in its power of healing."

Il a dit à maman qu’il vous avait trouvé extrêmement intelligent.","– I am swimming in joy, because you have conquered my great friend Bergotte. He told Mom he thought you were extremely smart.","""You can't think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte.

"Et, en effet, ce soir-là, je frappai trois coups – que une semaine plus tard quand je fus souffrant je renouvelai pendant quelques jours tous les matins parce que ma grand’mère voulait me donner du lait de bonne heure. Alors quand je croyais entendre qu’elle était réveillée – pour qu’elle n’attendît pas et pût, tout de suite après, se rendormir – je risquais trois petits coups, timidement, faiblement, distinctement malgré tout, car si je craignais d’interrompre son sommeil dans le cas où je me serais trompé et où elle eût dormi, je n’aurais pas voulu non plus qu’elle continuât d’épier un appel qu’elle n’aurait pas distingué d’abord et que je n’oserais pas renouveler. Et à peine j’avais frappé mes coups que j’en entendais trois autres, d’une intonation différente de ceux-là, empreints d’une calme autorité, répétés à deux reprises pour plus de clarté et qui disaient : « Ne t’agite pas, j’ai entendu, dans quelques instants je serai là » ; et bientôt après ma grand’mère arrivait. Je lui disais que j’avais eu peur qu’elle ne m’entendît pas ou crût que c’était un voisin qui avait frappé ; elle riait :","And, in fact, that evening I knocked three times – which a week later when I was unwell I repeated for a few days every morning because my grandmother wanted to give me milk early. So when I thought I heard that she was awake – so that she wouldn't wait and could go back to sleep right away – I risked three little knocks, timidly, weakly, distinctly in spite of everything, because if I was afraid of interrupt her sleep in the event that I had made a mistake and she had slept, nor would I have wanted her to continue to listen to a call that she had not recognized at first and that I had not would not dare renew. And no sooner had I struck my blows than I heard three others, of a different intonation from those, imbued with a calm authority, repeated twice for greater clarity and which said: ""Don't t' don't agitate, I heard, in a few moments I'll be there”; and soon after my grandmother arrived. I told her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me or that it was a neighbor who had knocked; she laughed:","And, sure enough, that evening I gave three knocks—a signal which, the week after, when I was ill, I repeated every morning for several days, because my grandmother wanted me to have some milk early. Then, when I thought that I could hear her stirring, so that she should not be kept waiting but might, the moment she had brought me the milk, go to sleep again, I ventured on three little taps, timidly, faintly, but for all that distinctly, for if I was afraid of disturbing her, supposing that I had been mistaken and that she was still asleep, I should not have wished her either to lie awake listening for a summons which she had not at once caught and which I should not have the courage to repeat. And scarcely had I given my taps than I heard three others, in a different intonation from mine, stamped with a calm authority, repeated twice over so that there should be no mistake, and saying to me plainly: ""Don't get excited; I heard you; I shall be with you in a minute!"" and shortly afterwards my grandmother appeared. I explained to her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me, or might think that it was some one in the room beyond who was lapping; at which she smiled:","So that evening I did give three knocks; and a week later, when I felt unwell for a few days, I did the same thing each morning, because she wanted me to have an early glass of milk. As soon as I thought I could hear she was awake, so as not to make her wait, to let her go back to sleep as soon as possible, I would try giving my three little knocks, gently and tentatively, but quite clearly, since, though I was reluctant to interrupt her sleep when it was possible I might have been mistaken and she was not awake , I would not have wanted her to lie there expecting a renewal of a summons which it was possible she might not have heard distinctly, but which I did not dare repeat. No sooner had I tapped on the wall than I heard her three answering knocks, quite different in their intonation from my own, full of a tone of serene control, repeated twice so that there should be no mistake, and clearly stating: ‘Not to worry – I heard; and I’ll be with you in a moment or two.’ And sure enough, she soon appeared. I said I had been anxious in case she might not have heard me or in case she thought it was someone else knocking on a wall close by. She would say with a laugh:"
"– Eh bien ! on ne sait pas ; avec les princes on ne sait jamais, répondit M. de Norpois ; les plus glorieux, ceux qui savent le plus se faire rendre ce qu’on leur doit, sont aussi quelquefois ceux qui s’embarrassent le moins des décrets de l’opinion publique, même les plus justifiés, pour peu qu’il s’agisse de récompenser certains attachements. Or, il est certain que le comte de Paris a toujours agréé avec beaucoup de bienveillance le dévouement de Swann qui est, d’ailleurs, un garçon d’esprit s’il en fut.","- Well ! we do not know ; with princes one never knows, replied M. de Norpois; the most glorious, those who know best how to get what is owed to them, are also sometimes those who bother the least with the decrees of public opinion, even the most justified ones, as long as it concerns to reward certain attachments. Now, it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always accepted with great benevolence the devotion of Swann who is, moreover, a boy of spirit if ever there was one.","""Well, we don't know; with Princes one never does know,"" replied M. de Norpois.

Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.""","– Well now, who can say? M. de Norpois replied. One never knows, with princes! Some of the most illustrious, some of those who are most adept at having rendered unto themselves what must be rendered, are also on occasion those who ride roughshod over even the most inviolable decrees of public opinion, if in so doing they can reward certain good and faithful servants. And what’s certain is that the Comte de Paris has always noted with the greatest good-will the devotion evinced by Swann, who is also, be it remembered, a fellow of fine wit."
"– Puisque vous avez l’air d’être du pays, dis-je à la pêcheuse, est-ce que vous auriez la bonté de faire une petite course pour moi ? Il faudrait aller devant un pâtissier qui est paraît-il sur une place, mais je ne sais pas où c’est, et où une voiture m’attend. Attendez !… pour ne pas confondre vous demanderez si c’est la voiture de la marquise de Villeparisis. Du reste vous verrez bien, elle a deux chevaux.","- Since you seem to be from the country, I said to the fisherwoman, would you be so kind as to run a little errand for me? You would have to go in front of a pastry chef who is apparently in a square, but I don't know where it is, and where a car is waiting for me. Wait!… so as not to confuse you, you will ask if it is the car of the Marquise de Villeparisis. Besides, you will see, she has two horses.","""Since you seem to belong to the place,"" I said to her, ""I wonder if you would be so good as to take a message for me. I want you to go to a pastry–cook's—which is apparently in a square, but I don't know where that is—where there is a carriage waiting for me. One moment! To make quite sure, will you ask if the carriage belongs to the Marquise de Villeparisis? But you can't miss it; it's a carriage and pair.""","‘You appear to belong here, I said. Would you please do me a small favour? There’s a carriage waiting for me somewhere about here – I’m not quite sure where, actually, outside some cake-shop in a square, I believe – and if you could just find it for me … Now, before you go, just to be sure it’s the right one , do make sure you inquire whether it’s the carriage of the Marquise de Villeparisis. But you can’t really mistake it – it’s got two horses.’"
"« L’idée de ce grand voile dans lequel les Anges portent le corps de la Vierge, trop sacré pour qu’ils osent le toucher directement (je lui dis que le même sujet était traité à Saint-André-des-Champs ; il avait vu des photographies du porche de cette dernière église mais me fit remarquer que l’empressement de ces petits paysans qui courent tous à la fois autour de la Vierge était autre chose que la gravité des deux grands anges presque italiens, si élancés, si doux) ; l’ange qui emporte l’âme de la Vierge pour la réunir à son corps ; dans la rencontre de la Vierge et d’Élisabeth, le geste de cette dernière qui touche le sein de Marie et s’émerveille de le sentir gonflé ; et le bras bandé de la sage-femme qui n’avait pas voulu croire, sans toucher, à l’Immaculée-Conception ; et la ceinture jetée par la Vierge à saint Thomas pour lui donner la preuve de sa résurrection ; ce voile aussi que la Vierge arrache de son sein pour en voiler la nudité de son fils d’un côté de qui l’Église recueille le sang, la liqueur de l’Eucharistie, tandis que, de l’autre, la Synagogue, dont le règne est fini, a les yeux bandés, tient un sceptre à demi brisé et laisse échapper, avec sa couronne qui lui tombe de la tête, les tables de l’ancienne Loi ; et l’époux qui aidant, à l’heure du Jugement dernier, sa jeune femme à sortir du tombeau lui appuie la main contre son propre cœur pour la rassurer et lui prouver qu’il bat vraiment, est-ce aussi assez chouette comme idée, assez trouvé ? Et l’ange qui emporte le soleil et la lune devenus inutiles puisqu’il est dit que la Lumière de la Croix sera sept fois plus puissante que celle des astres ; et celui qui trempe sa main dans l’eau du bain de Jésus pour voir si elle est assez chaude ; et celui qui sort des nuées pour poser sa couronne sur le front de la Vierge, et tous ceux qui penchés du haut du ciel, entre les balustres de la Jérusalem céleste, lèvent les bras d’épouvante ou de joie à la vue des supplices des méchants et du bonheur des élus ! Car c’est tous les cercles du ciel, tout un gigantesque poème théologique et symbolique que vous avez là. C’est fou, c’est divin, c’est mille fois supérieur à tout ce que vous verrez en Italie où d’ailleurs ce tympan a été littéralement copié par des sculpteurs de bien moins de génie. Il n’y a pas eu d’époque où tout le monde a du génie, tout ça c’est des blagues, ça serait plus fort que l’âge d’or. Le type qui a sculpté cette façade-là, croyez bien qu’il était aussi fort, qu’il avait des idées aussi profondes que les gens de maintenant que vous admirez le plus.

There was no time when everyone was genius, these are all jokes, it would be stronger than the golden age. The guy who sculpted that facade, believe me, he was as strong, he had as deep ideas as the people you admire the most now. I'd show you that, if we went together.

There never was a time when genius was universal; that is all nonsense; it would be going beyond the age of gold. The fellow who carved that front, you may make up your mind that he was every bit as great, that he had just as profound ideas as the men you admire most at the present day.

"Il avait fallu quitter Balbec en effet, le froid et l’humidité étant devenus trop pénétrants pour rester plus longtemps dans cet hôtel dépourvu de cheminées et de calorifère. J’oubliai d’ailleurs presque immédiatement ces dernières semaines. Ce que je revis presque invariablement quand je pensai à Balbec, ce furent les moments où chaque matin, pendant la belle saison, comme je devais l’après-midi sortir avec Albertine et ses amies, ma grand’mère sur l’ordre du médecin me forçait à rester couché dans l’obscurité. Le directeur donnait des ordres pour qu’on ne fît pas de bruit à mon étage et veillait lui-même à ce qu’ils fussent obéis. À cause de la trop grande lumière, je gardais fermés le plus longtemps possible les grands rideaux violets qui m’avaient témoigné tant d’hostilité le premier soir. Mais comme malgré les épingles avec lesquelles, pour que le jour ne passât pas, Françoise les attachait chaque soir, et qu’elle seule savait défaire, comme malgré les couvertures, le dessus de table en cretonne rouge, les étoffes prises ici ou là qu’elle y ajustait, elle n’arrivait pas à les faire joindre exactement, l’obscurité n’était pas complète et ils laissaient se répandre sur le tapis comme un écarlate effeuillement d’anémones, parmi lesquelles je ne pouvais m’empêcher de venir un instant poser mes pieds nus. Et sur le mur qui faisait face à la fenêtre, et qui se trouvait partiellement éclairé, un cylindre d’or que rien ne soutenait était verticalement posé et se déplaçait lentement comme la colonne lumineuse qui précédait les Hébreux dans le désert. Je me recouchais ; obligé de goûter, sans bouger, par l’imagination seulement, et tous à la fois, les plaisirs du jeu, du bain, de la marche, que la matinée conseillait, la joie faisait battre bruyamment mon cœur comme une machine en pleine action, mais immobile, et qui ne peut que décharger sa vitesse sur place en tournant sur elle-même.","It had indeed been necessary to leave Balbec, the cold and the humidity having become too penetrating to stay any longer in this hotel devoid of chimneys and heaters. I almost immediately forgot the last few weeks. What I almost invariably relived when I thought of Balbec were the moments when every morning, during the fine season, when I had to go out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother on the doctor's orders forced me to lie in the dark. The director gave orders that no noise should be made on my floor and saw to it that they were obeyed. Because of the too much light, I kept closed as long as possible the big purple curtains which had shown me so much hostility the first evening. But as in spite of the pins with which, so that the day would not pass, Françoise attached them each evening, and which she alone knew how to undo, as in spite of the blankets, the red cretonne table top, the fabrics taken here or there that 'she was adjusting to it, she couldn't get them to join exactly, the darkness was not complete and they let spread on the carpet like a scarlet leafing of anemones, among which I could not help but come put my bare feet down for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window, and which was partially lighted, a golden cylinder which nothing supported was placed vertically and moved slowly like the luminous column which preceded the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste, without moving, by imagination alone, and all at once, the pleasures of play, bathing, walking, which the morning advised, joy made my heart beat noisily like a machine in full action, but motionless, and which can only unload its speed on the spot by turning on itself.","It was high time, indeed, to leave Balbec, for the cold and damp had become too penetrating for us to stay any longer in a hotel which had neither fireplaces in the rooms nor a central furnace. Moreover, I forgot almost immediately these last weeks of our stay. What my mind's eye did almost invariably see when I thought of Balbec were the hours which, every morning during the fine weather, as I was going out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother, following the doctor's orders, insisted on my spending lying down, with the room darkened. The manager gave instructions that no noise was to be made on my landing, and came up himself to see that they were obeyed. Because the light outside was so strong, I kept drawn for as long as possible the big violet curtains which had adopted so hostile an attitude towards me the first evening. But as, in spite of the pins with which, so that the light should not enter, Françoise fastened them every night, pins which she alone knew how to unfasten; as in spite of the rugs, the red cretonne table–cover, the various fabrics collected here and there which she fitted in to her defensive scheme, she never succeeded in making them meet exactly, the darkness was not complete, and they allowed to spill over the carpet as it were a scarlet shower of anemone–petals, among which I could not resist the temptation to plunge my bare feet for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window and so was partially lighted, a cylinder of gold with no visible support was placed vertically and moved slowly along like the pillar of fire which went before the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste without moving, in imagination only, and all at once, the pleasures of games, bathing, walks which the morning prompted, joy made my heart beat thunderingly like a machine set going at full speed but fixed to the ground, which can spend its energy only by turning upon its own axis.","For eventually we had been obliged to leave Balbec, where the cold and the damp had become too penetrating for us to stay on in a hotel without fireplaces or heating system. Our final weeks there I forgot almost immediately. When I thought of Balbec, what came to mind almost invariably was the morning moments, at the height of summer, when, because I was going out with Albertine and the other girls in the afternoons, my grandmother made sure I obeyed the doctor’s instructions that I should stay in bed and lie there in complete darkness. The manager ordered that no noise must be made on my floor and personally ensured that these instructions were obeyed. Because the daylight was so bright, I kept the curtains closed as long as possible, those tall violet curtains which, on the first evening, had received me with such hostility. However, since Françoise never managed to close them completely and exclude every speck of light, despite the pins she stuck in them each evening, and which no one else could get out again, despite the blankets, the red cretonne table-cover, the odds and ends of cloth which she patched on, the darkness was in fact not complete, and they allowed a sprinkle of scarlet, as of a scatter of anemone petals, to dapple the carpet, in which I could not resist paddling for a moment with my bare feet. Opposite the window, on the wall which was partly illuminated, a golden cylinder stood upright, supported by thin air and slowly moving, like the pillar of fire which gave light to the Children of Israel as it led them through the way of the wilderness. Then I would go back to bed: obliged as I was to take all my pleasures simultaneously in imagination, without moving – playing, bathing, walking, whatever the morning sun advised – happiness made my heart beat louder, like a motor turning at full power, but motionless and out of gear, so that it can only discharge its power into the empty air as it idles at full speed."
"– Chic ? pourquoi ? demanda le bâtonnier, dissimulant sa joie sous un étonnement exagéré ; à cause de mes invités ? dit-il en sentant qu’il était incapable de feindre plus longtemps ; mais qu’est-ce que ça a de chic d’avoir des amis à déjeuner ? Faut bien qu’ils déjeunent quelque part !","– Fancy? Why ? asked the Bâtonnier, concealing his joy under an exaggerated astonishment; because of my guests? he said, feeling that he was unable to feign any longer; but what's chic about having friends over for lunch? They have to have lunch somewhere!","""Smart? Why should I?"" asked the barrister, concealing his rapture in an exaggerated astonishment. "" Because of my guests, do you mean?"" he went on, feeling that it was impossible to keep up the farce any longer. "" But what is there smart about having a few friends in to luncheon? After all, they must feed somewhere!""","Mixing with the upper crust, is that it? – Upper crust? Why on earth? the bâtonnier asked, masking his delight with a show of astonishment. What – oh, you mean my guests? he added, unable to keep up the pretence: But what’s ‘hob-nobbing’ in having some friends to lunch? They’ve got to have their lunch somewhere!"
"Il disait aussi, avec un sourire timide, de pages de lui pour lesquelles on lui déclarait son admiration : « Je crois que c’est assez vrai, c’est assez exact, cela peut être utile », mais simplement par modestie, comme à une femme à qui on dit que sa robe, ou sa fille, est ravissante, répond, pour la première : « Elle est commode », pour la seconde : « Elle a un bon caractère ». Mais l’instinct du constructeur était trop profond chez Bergotte pour qu’il ignorât que la seule preuve qu’il avait bâti utilement et selon la vérité, résidait dans la joie que son œuvre lui avait donnée, à lui d’abord, et aux autres ensuite. Seulement bien des années plus tard, quand il n’eut plus de talent, chaque fois qu’il écrivit quelque chose dont il n’était pas content, pour ne pas l’effacer comme il aurait dû, pour le publier, il se répéta, à soi-même cette fois : « Malgré tout, c’est assez exact, cela n’est pas inutile à mon pays. » De sorte que la phrase murmurée jadis devant ses admirateurs par une ruse de sa modestie, le fut, à la fin, dans le secret de son cœur, par les inquiétudes de son orgueil. Et les mêmes mots qui avaient servi à Bergotte d’excuse superflue pour la valeur de ses premières œuvres, lui devinrent comme une inefficace consolation de la médiocrité des dernières.","He also said, with a shy smile, of pages of his for which he was declared to be admired: ""I think it's quite true, it's quite exact, it could be useful"", but simply out of modesty, as if a woman to whom one says that her dress, or her daughter, is ravishing, answers, for the first: ""She is convenient"", for the second: ""She has a good character"". But the builder's instinct was too deep in Bergotte for him to ignore that the only proof that he had built usefully and according to the truth, resided in the joy that his work had given him, first of all to him, and to the others afterwards. Only many years later, when he had run out of talent, every time he wrote something he wasn't happy about, so as not to erase it as he should have, to publish it, he repeated himself , to himself this time: “Despite everything, it's quite accurate, it's not useless to my country. So that the phrase murmured formerly before his admirers by a ruse of his modesty, was in the end, in the secrecy of his heart, by the anxieties of his pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as a superfluous excuse for the value of his first works, became to him like an ineffective consolation for the mediocrity of his later ones.","He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration: ""I think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,"" but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, ""It is comfortable,"" or ""She is a good girl."" But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: ""After all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country."" So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest.","If anyone praised a piece of his own, he would say of it with a shy smile, ‘I think it’s all right , it’s not bad, it’s worth saying’; but this was mere modesty, after the manner of the woman who, on being told that her dress or her daughter is lovely, replies, ‘Well, it’s nice and comfortable’ or ‘Well, she’s a good-natured girl.’ But the artisan’s instinct ran too deep in Bergotte for him to be unaware that the sole proof of his having worked to good purpose, and in accord with truth, lay in the joy to be derived from his own work, by himself in the first place, and then by others. Unfortunately, many years later, when his talent had run out, whenever he wrote something that dissatisfied him, rather than scratching it out as he should have done, he talked himself into publishing it with the words he had once spoken to others: ‘Well, yes, it’s all right, it says something that’s worth saying, for the sake of my country …’ The phrases his feigned modesty had murmured for an admirer were later spoken, in the sincerity of his most secret self, to allay the misgivings of pride; the words which had been his unnecessary apology for the quality of his first works became his futile consolation for the mediocrity of his last."
"Et tout à la fin, les jours vinrent où je ne pouvais plus rentrer de la digue par la salle à manger, ses vitres n’étaient plus ouvertes, car il faisait nuit dehors, et l’essaim des pauvres et des curieux attirés par le flamboiement qu’ils ne pouvaient atteindre pendait, en noires grappes morfondues par la bise, aux parois lumineuses et glissantes de la ruche de verre.","And at the very end, the days came when I could no longer go back from the dyke through the dining room, its windows were no longer open, for it was dark outside, and the swarm of poor and curious people attracted by the a blaze which they could not reach hung, in black clusters muffled by the wind, from the luminous and slippery walls of the glass hive.","And then at the end of the season came the days when I could no longer pass indoors from the 'front' through the dining–room; its windows stood open no more, for it was night now outside and the swarm of poor folk and curious idlers, attracted by the blaze of light which they might not reach, hung in black clusters chilled by the north wind to the luminous sliding walls of that buzzing hive of glass.","Then, right at the end, there came days when it was no longer possible to step straight from the esplanade into the dining-room, because it was already dark outside and the glass-doors were not open, and the swarms of the poor and the curious, chilled to the marrow by the north wind, drawn towards the blazing, unreachable illuminations, were clinging in thick black clusters to the glowing sliding panels of our hive of glass."
"Quand Gilberte, qui d’habitude donnait ses goûters le jour où recevait sa mère, devait au contraire être absente et qu’à cause de cela je pouvais aller au « Choufleury » de Mme Swann, je la trouvais vêtue de quelque belle robe, certaines en taffetas, d’autres en faille, ou en velours, ou en crêpe de Chine, ou en satin, ou en soie, et qui non point lâches comme les déshabillés qu’elle revêtait ordinairement à la maison, mais combinées comme pour la sortie au dehors, donnaient cet après-midi-là à son oisiveté chez elle quelque chose d’alerte et d’agissant. Et sans doute la simplicité hardie de leur coupe était bien appropriée à sa taille et à ses mouvements dont les manches avaient l’air d’être la couleur, changeante selon les jours ; on aurait dit qu’il y avait soudain de la décision dans le velours bleu, une humeur facile dans le taffetas blanc, et qu’une sorte de réserve suprême et pleine de distinction dans la façon d’avancer le bras avait, pour devenir visible, revêtu l’apparence brillante du sourire des grands sacrifices, du crêpe de Chine noir. Mais en même temps, à ces robes si vives la complication des « garnitures » sans utilité pratique, sans raison d’être visible, ajoutait quelque chose de désintéressé, de pensif, de secret, qui s’accordait à la mélancolie que Mme Swann gardait toujours au moins dans la cernure de ses yeux et les phalanges de ses mains. Sous la profusion des porte-bonheur en saphir, des trèfles à quatre feuilles d’émail, des médailles d’argent, des médaillons d’or, des amulettes de turquoise, des chaînettes de rubis, des châtaignes de topaze, il y avait dans la robe elle-même tel dessin colorié poursuivant sur un empiècement rapporté son existence antérieure, telle rangée de petits boutons de satin qui ne boutonnaient rien et ne pouvaient pas se déboutonner, une soutache cherchant à faire plaisir avec la minutie, la discrétion d’un rappel délicat, lesquels, tout autant que les bijoux, avaient l’air – n’ayant sans cela aucune justification possible – de déceler une intention, d’être un gage de tendresse, de retenir une confidence, de répondre à une superstition, de garder le souvenir d’une guérison, d’un vœu, d’un amour ou d’une philippine. Et parfois, dans le velours bleu du corsage un soupçon de crevé Henri II, dans la robe de satin noir un léger renflement qui, soit aux manches, près des épaules, faisaient penser aux « gigots » 1830, soit, au contraire, sous la jupe « aux paniers » Louis XV, donnaient à la robe un air imperceptible d’être un costume, et en insinuant sous la vie présente comme une réminiscence indiscernable du passé, mêlaient à la personne de Mme Swann le charme de certaines héroïnes historiques ou romanesques. Et si je lui faisais remarquer : « Je ne joue pas au golf comme plusieurs de mes amies, disait-elle. Je n’aurais aucune excuse à être comme elles, vêtues de sweaters. »","When Gilberte, who usually gave her snacks on the day when her mother received her, had to be absent and because of that I could go to Madame Swann's ""Choufleury"", I found her dressed in some beautiful dress, certain in taffeta, others in faille, or in velvet, or in crepe de Chine, or in satin, or in silk, and which were not loose like the negligees she usually wore at home, but combined as for going out. outside, gave that afternoon to her idleness at home something alert and active. And no doubt the bold simplicity of their cut was well suited to her figure and her movements, of which the sleeves seemed to be the color, changing according to the day; one would have said that there was suddenly decision in the blue velvet, an easy mood in the white taffeta, and that a kind of supreme and distinguished reserve in the way of advancing the arm had, to become visible , dressed in the shining appearance of the smile of the great sacrifices, of the black crepe de chine. But at the same time, to these so bright dresses the complication of ""trims"" without practical utility, without visible reason for being, added something disinterested, thoughtful, secret, which suited the melancholy that Mme Swann kept always at least in the ring of his eyes and the knuckles of his hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire lucky charms, four-leaf enamel clovers, silver medallions, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains, topaz chestnuts, there were the dress itself, such a colored design continuing its previous existence on an added yoke, such a row of little satin buttons which did not button anything and could not be unbuttoned, a soutache seeking to please with the meticulousness, the discretion of a delicate reminder, which, just as much as the jewellery, seemed – otherwise having no possible justification – to detect an intention, to be a token of tenderness, to retain a confidence, to respond to a superstition, to keep the memory of a healing, a wish, a love or a Filipina. And sometimes, in the blue velvet of the bodice, a hint of Henri II burst, in the black satin dress, a slight bulge which, either at the sleeves, near the shoulders, made one think of the ""legs"" of 1830, or, on the contrary, under the skirt ""with baskets"" Louis XV, gave to the dress an imperceptible air of being a costume, and by insinuating under the present life like an indiscernible reminiscence of the past, mingled with the person of Mrs. Swann the charm of certain historical or romantic heroines . What if I pointed out to her: ""I don't play golf like many of my friends,"" she would say. I would have no excuse to be like them, dressed in sweaters. »","When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea–parties on the days when her mother was ""at home,"" had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann's 'kettledrum,' I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of grosgrain, or of velvet, or of crêpe–de–Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay–at–home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy–going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black crêpe–de–Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four–leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect—for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence—of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a 'philippine.' And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of 'slashes,' in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the 'leg of mutton' sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being 'fancy dress' and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: ""I don't play golf,"" she would answer, ""like so many of my friends. So I should have no excuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.""","Though Gilberte usually held her tea-parties on her mother’s at-home days, she sometimes went out instead; and when that happened I could go to one of Mme Swann’s ‘afternoon jamborees’. I would find her wearing a magnificent dress, sometimes of taffeta, sometimes of faille, or else of velvet, crêpe de Chine, satin or silk, not a loose garment like the house-dresses she usually wore at home, but with something of the walking-dress in it, which somehow gave to her afternoon idleness indoors a quality of readiness and activity. The dashing simplicity of their cut suited her figure and her movements, which seemed to colour her sleeves variously each day: on blue velvet days, the material was full of sudden decisiveness, which became simple good nature when it was the turn of white taffeta; and, so as to become visible, a sort of supreme and distinguished reserve in her way of holding out her arm had taken on the glowing smile of self-sacrifice that shines in black crêpe de Chine. But at the same time, her complicated ‘accessories’, which had no visible purpose or practical usefulness, added something to these brilliant dresses, something disinterested, thoughtful and secret, that matched the melancholy still to be seen round her eyes and in the delicate joints of her hands. Under the dangle of sapphire-studded lucky charms, enamelled four-leafed clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, fine ruby chains, chestnutsized topazes, there would be a coloured pattern patched on to the dress itself, a borrowed panel enjoying a new lease of life, a row of little satin buttons which could neither button anything nor ever be unbuttoned, a length of matching braid trying to please with the unobtrusive aptness of a subtle reminder; and all of them, like the jewels, seemed to be there – for otherwise they had no conceivable function – to hint at a purpose, to be a token of tenderness, to keep a secret, exercise a superstition, commemorate a cure, a vow, a lover or a philippine. Sometimes a hint of a Plantagenet slash in the blue velvet of a bodice, or a slight bulge in a black satin dress, either high on the sleeve suggesting the 1830s and their leg-of-mutton, or under the skirt suggesting Louis XV hoop-petticoats, would almost make it look as though she was in fancy dress; and by slipping this sort of barely recognizable allusion to the past into the life of the present, they added to the person of Mme Swann the charm of certain historical or fictional heroines. If I said this to her, she replied, ‘Unlike some of my friends, I do not play golf. Unlike me, they have an excuse for being swaddled in sweaters.’"

"Je me mis à parler du comte de Paris, à demander s’il n’était pas ami de Swann, car je craignais que la conversation se détournât de celui-ci. « Oui, en effet, répondit M. de Norpois en se tournant vers moi et en fixant sur ma modeste personne le regard bleu où flottaient, comme dans leur élément vital, ses grandes facultés de travail et son esprit d’assimilation. Et, mon Dieu, ajouta-t-il en s’adressant de nouveau à mon père, je ne crois pas franchir les bornes du respect dont je fais profession pour le Prince (sans cependant entretenir avec lui des relations personnelles que rendrait difficiles ma situation, si peu officielle qu’elle soit) en vous citant ce fait assez piquant que, pas plus tard qu’il y a quatre ans, dans une petite gare de chemins de fer d’un des pays de l’Europe Centrale, le Prince eut l’occasion d’apercevoir Mme Swann. Certes, aucun de ses familiers ne s’est permis de demander à Monseigneur comment il l’avait trouvée. Cela n’eût pas été séant. Mais quand par hasard la conversation amenait son nom, à de certains signes, imperceptibles si l’on veut, mais qui ne trompent pas, le Prince semblait donner assez volontiers à entendre que son impression était en somme loin d’avoir été défavorable.","I began to talk about the Comte de Paris, to ask if he was not a friend of Swann, for I feared the conversation would turn away from him. “Yes, indeed,” replied M. de Norpois, turning to me and fixing on my modest person the blue eyes in which floated, as in their vital element, his great faculties for work and his spirit of assimilation. And, my God, he added, addressing my father again, I do not think I have crossed the limits of the respect I profess for the Prince (without, however, maintaining personal relations with him which my situation would make difficult. , however unofficial it may be) by quoting to you this rather pungent fact that, no later than four years ago, in a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince had the opportunity to see Madame Swann. Certainly, none of his familiars dared to ask Monsignor how he had found her. It wouldn't have been fitting. But when by chance the conversation brought up his name, with certain signs, imperceptible if you will, but which do not deceive, the Prince seemed quite willing to give it to be understood that his impression was on the whole far from having been unfavorable.","I began next to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann's friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. "" Why, yes!"" replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And ""Upon my word,"" he added, once more addressing my father, ""I do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince (although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be), if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs—imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable—the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.""","Fearing that the conversation might turn away from the subject of the Swanns, I now broached the subject of the Comte de Paris,13 to ask M. de Norpois whether he was not a friend of Swann’s. ‘ Absolutely,’ M. de Norpois replied, turning towards me and staring at my modest person through the blue of his eyes, in which his great capacity for intellectual toil and his powers of assimilation could be seen floating as though in their natural element. Then he added, turning back to address my father, ‘And if I may say so, without overstepping the bounds of the respect which I profess for His Highness – albeit I do not entertain personal relations with him of a sort which would conflict with my position, however unofficial it is – I permit myself to retail to you a rather choice little incident which, as recently as four years ago, took place in a small railway-station in a certain country of Central Europe, where His Highness had occasion to set eyes on Mme Swann. Now of course, no one in his entourage saw fit to ask His Highness what he thought of her. Such a thing would not have been seemly. But when the vagaries of conversation happened subsequently to bring up her name, His Highness appeared not averse to letting it be divined, by means of certain signs, you understand, which though they may verge on the imperceptible, are withal quite unambiguous, that his impression of the lady had been far from, in a word, unfavourable."
"Nous le vîmes lire notre lettre, la remettre dans sa poche, continuer à dîner, commencer à demander ses affaires, se lever pour partir, et nous étions tellement sûrs de l’avoir choqué par notre démarche que nous eussions souhaité maintenant (tout autant que nous l’avions redouté) de partir sans avoir été remarqués par lui. Nous ne pensions pas un seul instant à une chose qui aurait dû pourtant nous sembler la plus importante, c’est que notre enthousiasme pour Elstir, de la sincérité duquel nous n’aurions pas permis qu’on doutât et dont nous aurions pu, en effet, donner comme témoignage notre respiration entrecoupée par l’attente, notre désir de faire n’importe quoi de difficile ou d’héroïque pour le grand homme, n’était pas, comme nous nous le figurions, de l’admiration, puisque nous n’avions jamais rien vu d’Elstir ; notre sentiment pouvait avoir pour objet l’idée creuse de « un grand artiste », non pas une œuvre qui nous était inconnue. C’était tout au plus de l’admiration à vide, le cadre nerveux, l’armature sentimentale d’une admiration sans contenu, c’est-à-dire quelque chose d’aussi indissolublement attaché à l’enfance que certains organes qui n’existent plus chez l’homme adulte ; nous étions encore des enfants. Elstir cependant allait arriver à la porte, quand tout à coup il fit un crochet et vint à nous. J’étais transporté d’une délicieuse épouvante comme je n’aurais pu en éprouver quelques années plus tard, parce que, en même temps que l’âge diminue la capacité, l’habitude du monde ôte toute idée de provoquer d’aussi étranges occasions de ressentir ce genre d’émotions.","We saw him read our letter, put it back in his pocket, continue to dine, begin to ask for his things, get up to leave, and we were so sure we had shocked him with our approach that we wished now (just as much as we had feared) to leave without being noticed by him. We did not think for a single moment of one thing which should have seemed to us the most important, and that is that our enthusiasm for Elstir, the sincerity of which we would not have allowed anyone to doubt and of which we could, in indeed, to give as testimony our breathing interrupted by expectation, our desire to do anything difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined, admiration, since we had never seen anything of Elstir; our feeling could have as its object the hollow idea of ""a great artist"", not a work which was unknown to us. It was at most empty admiration, the nervous framework, the sentimental armature of an admiration without content, that is to say something as indissolubly attached to childhood as certain organs which no longer exist in adult man; we were still children. Elstir, however, was about to arrive at the door, when suddenly he made a turn and came towards us. I was transported with a delicious dread such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, at the same time that age diminishes the capacity, the habit of the world removes all idea of provoking such strange opportunities to feel these kinds of emotions.","We watched him read our letter, put it in his pocket, finish his dinner, begin to ask for his things, get up to go; and we were so convinced that we had shocked him by our overture that we would now have hoped (as keenly as at first we had dreaded) to make our escape without his noticing us. We did not bear in mind for a single instant a consideration which should, nevertheless, have seemed to us most important, namely that our enthusiasm for Elstir, on the sincerity of which we should not have allowed the least doubt to be cast, which we could indeed have supported with the evidence of our breathing arrested by expectancy, our desire to do no matter what that was difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined it to be, admiration, since neither of us had ever seen anything that he had painted; our feeling might have as its object the hollow idea of a 'great artist,' but not a body of work which was unknown to us. It was, at the most, admiration in the abstract, the nervous envelope, the sentimental structure of an admiration without content, that is to say a thing as indissolubly attached to boyhood as are certain organs which have ceased to exist in the adult man; we were still boys. Elstir meanwhile was reaching the door when suddenly he turned and came towards us. I was transported by a delicious thrill of terror such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, while age diminishes our capacity, familiarity with the world has meanwhile destroyed in us any inclination to provoke such strange encounters, to feel that kind of emotion.","We saw Elstir read our letter, slip it into his pocket, go on with his dinner, then ask for his things and leave the table. By now we were so sure that by writing to him we had given offence that we would have preferred (as much as before we would have been reluctant) to leave the restaurant without being noticed by him. We gave not the slightest thought to a thing which should have seemed the most important of all: that our enthusiasm for Elstir, the sincerity of which we would not have allowed anyone to doubt (and in its support we could, of course, have alleged our bated breath and our wish to do anything for the great man, as long as it was difficult or heroic), was not, as we believed it was, admiration, since we had never seen any of his canvases; it was possible for such a feeling to be inspired by the empty idea of ‘a great artist’, but not by work which was completely unknown to us. At best, it was theoretical admiration, the nervous framework and emotional skeleton of an admiration without object, that is to say, something as inseparably linked to childhood as certain organs which no longer exist in the body of a grown man: we were still boys. Elstir had almost reached the door, when he turned and came towards us. I felt myself flooded with a feeling of delicious terror, the like of which I would have been incapable of experiencing a few years later, for not only does age diminish the ability, but habituation to society takes away all impulse, to bring about such strange occasions and the sort of feelings that accompany them."
"Je pensais que ma situation vis-à-vis d’Albertine allait en être améliorée. Elles étaient les filles d’une parente de Mme de Villeparisis et qui connaissait aussi Mme de Luxembourg. M. et Mme d’Ambresac qui avaient une petite villa à Balbec, et excessivement riches, menaient une vie des plus simples, étaient toujours habillés, le mari du même veston, la femme d’une robe sombre. Tous deux faisaient à ma grand’mère d’immenses saluts qui ne menaient à rien. Les filles, très jolies, s’habillaient avec plus d’élégance, mais une élégance de ville et non de plage. Dans leurs robes longues, sous leurs grands chapeaux, elles avaient l’air d’appartenir à une autre humanité qu’Albertine. Celle-ci savait très bien qui elles étaient. « Ah ! vous connaissez les petites d’Ambresac. Hé bien, vous connaissez des gens très chics. Du reste, ils sont très simples, ajouta-t-elle comme si c’était contradictoire. Elles sont très gentilles mais tellement bien élevées qu’on ne les laisse pas aller au Casino, surtout à cause de nous, parce que nous avons trop mauvais genre. Elles vous plaisent ? Dame, ça dépend. C’est tout à fait les petites oies blanches. Ça a peut-être son charme. Si vous aimez les petites oies blanches, vous êtes servi à souhait. Il paraît qu’elles peuvent plaire puisqu’il y en a déjà une de fiancée au marquis de Saint-Loup. Et cela fait beaucoup de peine à la cadette qui était amoureuse de ce jeune homme. Moi, rien que leur manière de parler du bout des lèvres m’énerve. Et puis elles s’habillent d’une manière ridicule. Elles vont jouer au golf en robes de soie. À leur âge elles sont mises plus prétentieusement que des femmes âgées qui savent s’habiller. Tenez Madame Elstir, voilà une femme élégante. » Je répondis qu’elle m’avait semblé vêtue avec beaucoup de simplicité. Albertine se mit à rire. « Elle est mise très simplement, en effet, mais elle s’habille à ravir et pour arriver à ce que vous trouvez de la simplicité, elle dépense un argent fou. » Les robes de Mme Elstir passaient inaperçues aux yeux de quelqu’un qui n’avait pas le goût sûr et sobre des choses de la toilette. Il me faisait défaut. Elstir le possédait au suprême degré, à ce que me dit Albertine. Je ne m’en étais pas douté ni que les choses élégantes mais simples qui emplissaient son atelier étaient des merveilles désirées par lui, qu’il avait suivies de vente en vente, connaissant toute leur histoire, jusqu’au jour où il avait gagné assez d’argent pour pouvoir les posséder. Mais là-dessus Albertine, aussi ignorante que moi, ne pouvait rien m’apprendre. Tandis que pour les toilettes, avertie par un instinct de coquette et peut-être par un regret de jeune fille pauvre qui goûte avec plus de désintéressement, de délicatesse, chez les riches, ce dont elle ne pourra se parer elle-même, elle sut me parler très bien des raffinements d’Elstir, si difficile qu’il trouvait toute femme mal habillée, et que mettant tout un monde dans une proportion, dans une nuance, il faisait faire pour sa femme à des prix fous des ombrelles, des chapeaux, des manteaux qu’il avait appris à Albertine à trouver charmants et qu’une personne sans goût n’eût pas plus remarqués que je n’avais fait. Du reste, Albertine qui avait fait un peu de peinture sans avoir d’ailleurs, elle l’avouait, aucune « disposition », éprouvait une grande admiration pour Elstir, et grâce à ce qu’il lui avait dit et montré, s’y connaissait en tableaux d’une façon qui contrastait fort avec son enthousiasme pour Cavalleria Rusticana. C’est qu’en réalité, bien que cela ne se vît guère encore, elle était très intelligente et dans les choses qu’elle disait, la bêtise n’était pas sienne, mais celle de son milieu et de son âge. Elstir avait eu sur elle une influence heureuse mais partielle. Toutes les formes de l’intelligence n’étaient pas arrivées chez Albertine au même degré de développement. Le goût de la peinture avait presque rattrapé celui de la toilette et de toutes les formes de l’élégance, mais n’avait pas été suivi par le goût de la musique qui restait fort en arrière.","I thought that my situation vis-à-vis Albertine would be improved. They were the daughters of a relative of Madame de Villeparisis who also knew Madame de Luxembourg. Monsieur and Madame d'Ambresac, who had a little villa at Balbec, and were extremely rich, led the simplest of lives, were always dressed, the husband in the same jacket, the wife in a dark dress. Both of them made immense bows to my grandmother, which led to nothing. The girls, very pretty, dressed with more elegance, but an elegance of the city and not of the beach. In their long dresses, under their big hats, they seemed to belong to a different humanity from Albertine. She knew very well who they were. “Oh! you know the little ones from Ambresac. Well, you know some very classy people. Besides, they are very simple, she added as if it were contradictory. They are very nice but so well brought up that we do not let them go to the Casino, especially because of us, because we are too bad. Do you like them? Lady, it depends. It's quite the little white geese. Maybe it has its charm. If you like little white geese, you are served to perfection. It seems that they can please since there is already one engaged to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. And it hurts the youngest who was in love with this young man. Me, just their way of talking lip service annoys me. And then they dress in a ridiculous way. They go golfing in silk robes. At their age they are dressed more pretentiously than older women who know how to dress. Take Madame Elstir, here is an elegant woman. I replied that she seemed to me to be dressed very simply. Albertine began to laugh. “She is dressed very simply, indeed, but she dresses beautifully and to achieve what you find simplicity, she spends a lot of money. Madame Elstir's dresses passed unnoticed in the eyes of someone who had no sure and sober taste for things of the toilet. He was missing me. Elstir possessed it to the highest degree, so Albertine tells me. I had no idea either that the elegant but simple things that filled his studio were marvels desired by him, which he had followed from sale to sale, knowing all their history, until the day he had earned enough money to own them. But thereupon Albertine, as ignorant as I, could teach me nothing. Whereas for the toilets, informed by a flirtatious instinct and perhaps by a regret of a poor young girl who tastes with more disinterestedness, delicacy, at the rich, what she will not be able to adorn herself with, she knew how to talk to me very well about the refinements of Elstir, so difficult that he found any woman badly dressed, and that putting everyone in a proportion, in a nuance, he had parasols, hats made for his wife at crazy prices , coats which he had taught Albertine to find charming and which a tasteless person would not have noticed any more than I had. Besides, Albertine, who had done a little painting without having, moreover, she admitted, any ""disposition"", felt a great admiration for Elstir, and thanks to what he had told and shown her, knew paintings in a way that contrasted sharply with his enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. It is that in reality, although it is hardly seen yet, she was very intelligent and in the things she said, the stupidity was not hers, but that of her environment and her age. Elstir had had a happy but partial influence on her. All the forms of intelligence had not arrived in Albertine at the same degree of development. The taste for painting had almost caught up with that for dressing and all forms of elegance, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which lagged far behind.","I felt that, in Albertine's eyes, my position would be improved by this meeting. They were the daughters of a kinswoman of Mme. de Villeparisis, who was also a friend of Mme. de Luxembourg. M. and Mme. d'Ambresac, who had a small villa at Balbec and were immensely rich, led the simplest of lives there, and always went about dressed he in an unvarying frock coat, she in a dark gown. Both of them used to make sweeping bows to my grandmother, which never led to anything further. The daughters, who were very pretty, were dressed more fashionably, but in a fashion suited rather to Paris than to the seaside. With their long skirts and large hats, they had the look of belonging to a different race from Albertine. She, I discovered, knew all about them. ""Oh, so you know the little d'Ambresacs, do you? Dear me, you have some swagger friends. After all, they're very simple souls,"" she went on as though this might account for it. ""They're very nice, but so well brought up that they aren't allowed near the Casino, for fear of us— we've such a bad tone. They attract you, do they? Well, it all depends on what you like. They're just little white rabbits, really. There may be something in that, of course. If little white rabbits are what appeals to you, they may supply a long–felt want. It seems, there must be some attraction, because one of them has got engaged already to the Marquis de Saint–Loup. Which is a cruel blow to the younger one, who is madly in love with that young man. I'm sure, the way they speak to you with their lips shut is quite enough for me. And then they dress in the most absurd way. Fancy going to play golf in silk frocks! At their age, they dress more showily than grown–up women who really know about clothes. Look at Mme. Elstir; there's a well dressed woman if you like. "" I answered that she had struck me as being dressed with the utmost simplicity. Albertine laughed. ""She does put on the simplest things, I admit, but she dresses wonderfully, and to get what you call simplicity costs her a fortune."" Mme. Elstir's gowns passed unnoticed by any one who had not a sober and unerring taste in matters of attire. This was lacking in me. Elstir possessed it in a supreme degree, or so Albertine told me. I had not suspected this, nor that the beautiful but quite simple objects which littered his studio were treasures long desired by him which he had followed from sale room to sale room, knowing all their history, until he had made enough money to be able to acquire them. But as to this Albertine, being as ignorant as myself, could not enlighten me. Whereas when it came to clothes, prompted by a coquettish instinct, and perhaps by the regretful longing of a penniless girl who is able to appreciate with greater disinterestedness, more delicacy of feeling, in other, richer people the things that she will never be able to afford for herself, she expressed herself admirably on the refinement of Elstir's taste, so hard to satisfy that all women appeared to him badly dressed, while, attaching infinite importance to right proportions and shades of colour, he would order to be made for his wife, at fabulous prices, the sunshades, hats and cloaks which he had learned from Albertine to regard as charming, and which a person wanting in taste would no more have noticed than myself. Apart from this, Albertine, who had done a little painting, though without, she confessed, having any 'gift' for it, felt a boundless admiration for Elstir, and, thanks to his precept and example, shewed a judgment of pictures which was in marked contrast to her enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. The truth was, though as yet it was hardly apparent, that she was highly intelligent, and that in the things that she said the stupidity was not her own but that of her environment and age. Elstir's had been a good but only a partial influence. All the branches of her intelligence had not reached the same stage of development. The taste for pictures had almost caught up the taste for clothes and all forms of smartness, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which was still a long way behind.","This made me think that my situation with Albertine might improve. The mother of these two girls was a relative of Mme de Villeparisis’s, and she also knew the Princess of Luxembourg. M. and Mme d’Ambresac, who owned a small villa at Balbec, though exceedingly rich, lived very simply, the husband always wearing the same jacket, the wife always a dark dress. They always made a great show of bowing to my grandmother, but went no further. The daughters, both very pretty, were more elegant dressers, but it was Paris elegance, not seaside elegance. In their long dresses, under their expansive hats, they seemed to be a very different breed from Albertine. She was quite aware of who they were. ‘Oh, so you know the d’Ambresac girls, do you? In that case, you know some pretty posh people. Actually, they’re very simple people, she added, as though there was some contradiction in this. They’re very nice but so well bred that they’re not allowed to go to the Casino, especially because of us, because we’re so unladylike. Do you like them? Well, they’re not everyone’s cup of tea. Little innocents, the pair of them. The sort of thing some people might find quite to their taste. If you fancy little innocents, there you are, plenty to choose from. And it seems there are people who like that sort of thing: one of them’s already betrothed to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. And the younger one, who was in love with the gentleman herself, is breaking her heart. I must say I can’t stand the way they speak, as though butter wouldn’t melt in their mouths. And they wear such ludicrous things – imagine, playing golf in a silk frock! At their age, their get-up is more pretentious than older women who have a sense of dress. I mean, Mme Elstir for instance , there’s a woman who dresses well.’ I said Mme Elstir’s way of dressing had struck me as very simple. Albertine burst out laughing: ‘ Of course she’s simple in her way of dressing! But her way is so delightfully right! And to get the effect that you see as simplicity, she spends a fortune.’ To someone whose taste in things of dress was poor or deficient, there was nothing remarkable in Mme Elstir’s dresses. Taste in these things, which I lacked, Elstir had in abundance, or so Albertine said. I had had no idea of this; nor had I noticed that the objects ranged about his studio were wonders of elegance, but also of simplicity, things he had yearned to possess for a long time, which he had kept an eye on at every auction, things whose whole history he knew, until the day came when he had made enough money to acquire them. Albertine, who was as ignorant as I was on this aspect of Elstir, could tell me nothing about it. However, on women’s dress, with her instinctive delight in attractive clothes, and perhaps also with something of the longing of the girl who, though poor, is disinterested and modest enough to enjoy the spectacle of rich people wearing what she will never be able to afford, she could tell me things about Elstir’s standards of taste, so refined and exacting that in his view all women were badly dressed, and that, with his concern for every proportion and slightest nuance, he would spend huge sums having his wife’s sunshades, hats and cloaks made, explaining to Albertine the while the charm of such things, to which a person devoid of taste would have been as oblivious as I had been. Albertine had also dabbled in painting, though she had, as she said herself, no ‘bent’ for it, and greatly admired Elstir; and, from what he had told her and shown her, she had acquired an appreciation of good painting which was in marked contrast with her liking for Cavalleria Rusticana. The fact was, invisible as this was to me at the time, she was highly intelligent; and though there was stupidity in things she said, it was not her own, but that of her peers. Elstir had influenced her for the better, but only partially. Not all modes of cultivation and sensibility were equally developed in her. Her appreciation of painting now almost equalled her liking for clothes and for all things fashionable, but it was unaccompanied by an appreciation of good music."

Je l’aurais pris aussi si je n’avais été fatigué et aurais accompagné mon ami jusqu’à Doncières ; je lui promis du moins, tout le temps que nous restâmes à la gare de Balbec – c’est-à-dire que le chauffeur du petit train passa à attendre des amis retardataires, sans lesquels il ne voulait pas s’en aller, et aussi à prendre quelques rafraîchissements – d’aller le voir plusieurs fois par semaine. Comme Bloch était venu aussi à la gare – au grand ennui de Saint-Loup – ce dernier voyant que notre camarade l’entendait me prier de venir déjeuner, dîner, habiter à Doncières, finit par lui dire d’un ton extrêmement froid, lequel était chargé de corriger l’amabilité forcée de l’invitation et d’empêcher Bloch de la prendre au sérieux : « Si jamais vous passez par Doncières une après-midi où je sois libre, vous pourrez me demander au quartier, mais libre, je ne le suis à peu près jamais. » Peut-être aussi Robert craignait-il que, seul, je ne vinsse pas et pensant que j’étais plus lié avec Bloch que je ne le disais, me mettait-il ainsi en mesure d’avoir un compagnon de route, un entraîneur.","“It may be, concluded Saint-Loup, I will take the little 'twirler'. I would have taken it too if I had not been tired and would have accompanied my friend to Doncières; I promised him at least, all the time we stayed at the Balbec station – that is to say, the driver of the little train spent waiting for latecomers, without whom he did not want to leave, and also to have some refreshments – to go and see him several times a week. As Bloch had also come to the station – to the great annoyance of Saint-Loup – the latter, seeing that our comrade heard him asking me to come to lunch, dinner, live in Doncières, ended up telling him in an extremely cold tone, which was responsible for correcting the forced friendliness of the invitation and preventing Bloch from taking it seriously: ""If you ever pass by Doncières on an afternoon when I'm free, you can ask me in the neighborhood, but free, I almost never am. Perhaps also Robert was afraid that I would not come alone, and thinking that I was more connected with Bloch than I was saying, he was thus putting me in a position to have a traveling companion, a trainer. .",""" Very well,"" Saint–Loup had decided, ""I will take the 'little crawler.' "" I should have taken it too, had I not been tired, and gone with my friend to Doncières; failing this I kept on promising, all the time that we waited in the Balbec station—the time, that is to say, which the driver of the little train spent in waiting for unpunctual friends, without whom he refused to start, and also in seeking some refreshment for himself—to go over there and see him several times a week. As Bloch had come to the station also—much to Saint– Loup's disgust—the latter, seeing that our companion could hear him begging me to come to luncheon, to dinner, to stay altogether at Doncières, finally turned to him and, in the most forbidding tone, intended to counteract the forced civility of the invitation and to prevent Bloch from taking it seriously: ""If you ever happen to be passing through Doncières any afternoon when I am off duty, you might ask for me at the barracks; but I hardly ever am off duty."" Perhaps, also, Robert feared lest, if left to myself, I might not come, and, thinking that I was more intimate with Bloch than I made out, was providing me in this way with a travelling companion, one who would urge me on.","‘Right, Saint-Loup had said, I’ll take the little Slowcoach.’ I would have taken it too and accompanied my friend to Doncières, if I had not been tired out; but during the time the little train spent in the station at Balbec – that is, the time the driver spent waiting for friends who were late and without whom he did want to start, and having a drink – I promised Saint-Loup I would visit him several times a week. Bloch had also come to see him off, to Saint-Loup’s great displeasure; and having noticed that Bloch had overheard him urging me to come to Doncières for lunch or dinner, or even to stay, he eventually said to him, in a tone of great coldness, intended to counter the forced politeness of the invitation, and to prevent Bloch from thinking he meant it: ‘If you should ever happen to be passing through Doncières some afternoon when I’m off duty, you could ask for me at the barracks, but I’m hardly ever off duty.’ Robert may also have feared that if left to myself I might not come; and in the belief that I was closer to Bloch than I had given him to understand, he may have thought the latter could be relied upon to make me bestir myself, to serve as a travelling companion."
"J’ai dit qu’Albertine ne m’était pas apparue ce jour-là la même que les précédents, et que chaque fois elle devait me sembler différente. Mais je sentis à ce moment que certaines modifications dans l’aspect, l’importance, la grandeur d’un être peuvent tenir aussi à la variabilité de certains états interposés entre cet être et nous. L’un de ceux qui jouent à cet égard le rôle le plus considérable est la croyance (ce soir-là, la croyance, puis l’évanouissement de la croyance que j’allais connaître Albertine, l’avait, à quelques secondes d’intervalle, rendue presque insignifiante puis infiniment précieuse à mes yeux ; quelques années plus tard, la croyance, puis la disparition de la croyance qu’Albertine m’était fidèle, amena des changements analogues).","I said that Albertine did not appear to me that day the same as the preceding ones, and that each time she must have seemed different to me. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the aspect, the importance, the size of a being can also be due to the variability of certain states interposed between this being and us. One of those which play the most considerable role in this respect is the belief (that evening, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief that I was going to know Albertine, had her, a few seconds from interval, rendered almost insignificant then infinitely precious in my eyes; a few years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief that Albertine was faithful to me, brought about analogous changes).","I have said that Albertine had not seemed to me that day to be the same as on previous days and that afterwards, each time I saw her, she was to appear different. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the appearance, the importance, the stature of a person may also be due to the variability of certain states of consciousness interposed between that person and us. One of those that play an important part in such transformations is belief; that evening my belief, then the vanishing of my belief, that I was about to know Albertine had, with a few seconds' interval only, rendered her almost insignificant, then infinitely precious in my sight; some years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief, that Albertine was faithful to me brought about similar changes.","I have said that, on that day, Albertine did not appear to be the same as on previous occasions, and that each time I saw her she was to seem different. But at that particular moment, I sensed also that certain changes in the appearance, the importance or the size of a person can be explained by the variability of the factors which may interpose between us and the other. One of the most potent in that regard is a belief in our mind: on that evening, within a matter of seconds, my belief that I was going to meet Albertine, then the annihilation of that belief, had made her almost insignificant to me, then infinitely precious; and some years later, the belief that she was faithful to me, followed by disbelief, would have analogous results."
"– Non, non, non, non, nous restons cachés, comme l’humble violette.","– No, no, no, no, we remain hidden, like the humble violet.","""No, no, no, no! We lie hidden, like the modest violet.""","– No, no! We’re shy retiring little violets!"
"– Si, j’ai fait semblant de me tromper, j’ai pris la carte, elle a comme nom de guerre la princesse de Luxembourg ! Avais-je raison de me méfier ! C’est agréable d’avoir ici une promiscuité avec cette espèce de Baronne d’Ange.","– Yes, I pretended to be wrong, I took the card, her nom de guerre is the Princess of Luxembourg! Was I right to be suspicious! It's nice to have promiscuity here with this kind of Baroness d'Ange.","""Yes, I made a mistake on purpose; I picked up her card; she trades under the name of the 'Princesse de Luxembourg!' Wasn't I right to have my doubts about her? It's a nice thing to have to mix promiscuously with a Baronne d'Ange like that?","I picked up her card, pretending to think it was someone else’s. She purports to be called the ‘Princess of Luxembourg’! Didn’t I tell you I could smell a rat? Isn’t it charming to have to rub shoulders with the likes of the Baronne d’Ange!’24"
"Ma grand’mère prit congé de Mme de Villeparisis pour que nous pussions rester à respirer l’air un instant de plus devant l’hôtel, en attendant qu’on nous fît signe à travers le vitrage que notre déjeuner était servi. On entendit un tumulte. C’était la jeune maîtresse du roi des sauvages, qui venait de prendre son bain et rentrait déjeuner.","My grandmother said goodbye to Madame de Villeparisis so that we could stand in front of the hotel breathing the air a moment longer, while waiting for someone to signal to us through the window that our lunch was served. A commotion was heard. She was the young mistress of the king of the savages, who had just taken her bath and was returning to breakfast.","My grandmother bade Mme. de Villeparisis good –bye, so that we might stay and imbibe the fresh air for a little while longer outside the hotel, until they signalled to us through the glazed partition that our luncheon was ready. There were sounds of tumult. The young mistress of the King of the Cannibal Island had been down to bathe and was now coming back to the hotel.","My grandmother took leave of Mme de Villeparisis outside the hotel, so that we could enjoy a little more of the sea-air before lunch-time, of which we would be informed by beckonings through the glass screens. We heard a chorus of shouts: the young mistress of the King of the South Seas, having just been down for a bathe, was coming back up for lunch."
"Je vis les arbres s’éloigner en agitant leurs bras désespérés, semblant me dire : ce que tu n’apprends pas de nous aujourd’hui, tu ne le sauras jamais. Si tu nous laisses retomber au fond de ce chemin d’où nous cherchions à nous hisser jusqu’à toi, toute une partie de toi-même que nous t’apportions tombera pour jamais au néant. En effet, si dans la suite je retrouvai le genre de plaisir et d’inquiétude que je venais de sentir encore une fois, et si un soir – trop tard, mais pour toujours – je m’attachai à lui, de ces arbres eux-mêmes, en revanche je ne sus jamais ce qu’ils avaient voulu m’apporter ni où je les avais vus. Et quand, la voiture ayant bifurqué, je leur tournai le dos et cessai de les voir, tandis que Mme de Villeparisis me demandait pourquoi j’avais l’air rêveur, j’étais triste comme si je venais de perdre un ami, de mourir moi-même, de renier un mort ou de méconnaître un Dieu.","I saw the trees move away, waving their desperate arms, seeming to say to me: what you don't learn from us today, you will never know. If you let us fall back to the bottom of this path from which we were trying to hoist ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself that we brought to you will fall forever into nothingness. Indeed, if afterwards I rediscovered the kind of pleasure and anxiety that I had just felt once again, and if one evening – too late, but forever – I attached myself to him, to these trees themselves. same, on the other hand I never knew what they had wanted to bring me or where I had seen them. And when, the car having turned off, I turned my back on them and stopped seeing them, while Madame de Villeparisis asked me why I looked dreamy, I was sad as if I had just lost a friend, died myself, to deny a dead person or to misunderstand a God.","I watched the trees gradually withdraw, waving their despairing arms, seeming to say to me: ""What you fail to learn from us to–day, you will never know. If you allow us to drop back into the hollow of this road from which we sought to raise ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself which we were bringing to you will fall for ever into the abyss."" And indeed if, in the course of time, I did discover the kind of pleasure and of disturbance which I had just been feeling once again, and if one evening—too late, but then for all time—I fastened myself to it, of those trees themselves I was never to know what they had been trying to give me nor where else I had seen them. And when, the road having forked and the carriage with it, I turned my back on them and ceased to see them, with Mme. de Villeparisis asking me what I was dreaming about, I was as wretched as though I had just lost a friend, had died myself, had broken faith with the dead or had denied my God.","I watched the trees as they disappeared, waving at me in despair and seeming to say, ‘Whatever you fail to learn from us today you will never learn. If you let us fall by this wayside where we stood striving to reach you, a whole part of your self which we brought for you will return for ever to nothing.’ And it is true that, though the same mode of pleasure and disquiet which I had just experienced once more was to come back to me in later years, though I did attend to it at last one evening – too late, but for ever – I never did find out what it was these particular trees had attempted to convey to me, or where it was that I had once seen them. When the carriage went round a corner, I lost sight of them somewhere behind me; and when Mme de Villeparisis asked me why I looked so forlorn, I was as sad as though I had just lost a friend or felt something die in myself, as though I had broken a promise to a dead man or failed to recognize a god."
"Un chagrin causé par une personne qu’on aime peut être amer, même quand il est inséré au milieu de préoccupations, de joies, qui n’ont pas cet être pour objet et desquelles notre attention ne se détourne que de temps en temps pour revenir à lui. Mais quand un tel chagrin naît – comme c’était le cas pour celui-ci – à un moment où le bonheur de voir cette personne nous remplit tout entiers, la brusque dépression qui se produit alors dans notre âme jusque-là ensoleillée, soutenue et calme, détermine en nous une tempête furieuse contre laquelle nous ne savons pas si nous serons capables de lutter jusqu’au bout. Celle qui soufflait sur mon cœur était si violente que je revins vers la maison, bousculé, meurtri, sentant que je ne pourrais retrouver la respiration qu’en rebroussant chemin, qu’en retournant sous un prétexte quelconque auprès de Gilberte. Mais elle se serait dit : « Encore lui ! Décidément je peux tout me permettre, il reviendra chaque fois d’autant plus docile qu’il m’aura quittée plus malheureux. » Puis j’étais irrésistiblement ramené vers elle par ma pensée, et ces orientations alternatives, cet affolement de la boussole intérieure persistèrent quand je fus rentré, et se traduisirent par les brouillons de lettres contradictoires que j’écrivis à Gilberte.","A grief caused by a person we love can be bitter, even when it is inserted in the midst of concerns, of joys, which do not have this being as their object and from which our attention only turns away from time to time to return to him. But when such grief arises – as it did this – at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us entirely, the sudden depression which then occurs in our hitherto sunny, sustained and calm, determines in us a furious storm against which we do not know if we will be able to fight until the end. The one that was blowing on my heart was so violent that I came back towards the house, jostled, bruised, feeling that I could only find my breath by turning back, by returning under some pretext to Gilberte. But she would have said to herself: ""Again him!"" Definitely I can allow myself everything, he will come back each time all the more docile as he will have left me more unhappy. Then I was irresistibly drawn back to her by my thoughts, and these alternative orientations, this panic of the interior compass persisted when I returned, and were expressed by the drafts of contradictory letters that I wrote to Gilberte.","Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth—as was now happening—at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever pretext, into Gilberte's presence. But she would have said to herself: ""Back again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he'll be. "" Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass–needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft.","A sadness caused by somebody one loves may be bitter, even when it happens amid a round of pastimes, joys and preoccupations which are extraneous to that person and which, except for brief moments, divert our mind from it. But when such a sadness comes right at the moment when we are basking in the full delight of being with that person, as was my case with Gilberte, the sudden depression which replaces the broad, tranquil sunlight of our inner summer sets off within us a storm so wild that we may doubt our ability to weather it. As I went home that evening, my heart was buffeted and bruised with such violence that I felt I could only get my breath back by retracing my steps, by making up some excuse to return to Gilberte. But she would only have thought: ‘Him again! Obviously I can treat him like dirt! The more unhappy I make him, the easier he’ll be to manage!’ In my mind, however, I was irresistibly drawn back to her; and these alternating urges, the crazy fluctuations of my inner compass, persisted after I reached home, where they turned into the drafts of incoherent letters which I wrote to her."
"À la fin nous aussi, nous fîmes une relation, malgré mais par ma grand’mère, car elle et Mme de Villeparisis tombèrent un matin l’une sur l’autre dans une porte et furent obligées de s’aborder non sans échanger au préalable des gestes de surprise, d’hésitation, exécuter des mouvements de recul, de doute et enfin des protestations de politesse et de joie comme dans certaines pièces de Molière où deux acteurs monologuant depuis longtemps chacun de son côté à quelques pas l’un de l’autre, sont censés ne pas s’être vus encore, et tout à coup s’aperçoivent, n’en peuvent croire leurs yeux, entrecoupent leurs propos, finalement parlent ensemble, le cœur ayant suivi le dialogue, et se jettent dans les bras l’un de l’autre. Mme de Villeparisis par discrétion voulut au bout d’un instant quitter ma grand’mère qui, au contraire, préféra la retenir jusqu’au déjeuner, désirant apprendre comment elle faisait pour avoir son courrier plus tôt que nous et de bonnes grillades (car Mme de Villeparisis, très gourmande, goûtait fort peu la cuisine de l’hôtel où l’on nous servait des repas que ma grand’mère, citant toujours Mme de Sévigné, prétendait être « d’une magnificence à mourir de faim »). Et la marquise prit l’habitude de venir tous les jours, en attendant qu’on la servît, s’asseoir un moment près de nous dans la salle à manger, sans permettre que nous nous levions, que nous nous dérangions en rien. Tout au plus nous attardions-nous souvent à causer avec elle, notre déjeuner fini, à ce moment sordide où les couteaux traînent sur la nappe à côté des serviettes défaites. Pour ma part, afin de garder, pour pouvoir aimer Balbec, l’idée que j’étais sur la pointe extrême de la terre, je m’efforçais de regarder plus loin, de ne voir que la mer, d’y chercher des effets décrits par Baudelaire et de ne laisser tomber mes regards sur notre table que les jours où y était servi quelque vaste poisson, monstre marin, qui, au contraire des couteaux et des fourchettes, était contemporain des époques primitives où la vie commençait à affluer dans l’Océan, au temps des Cimmériens, et duquel le corps aux innombrables vertèbres, aux nerfs bleus et roses, avait été construit par la nature, mais selon un plan architectural, comme une polychrome cathédrale de la mer.","In the end we too made a connection, in spite of but through my grandmother, because she and Madame de Villeparisis ran into each other in a doorway one morning and were forced to approach each other, not without first talking. gestures of surprise, hesitation, executing movements of recoil, of doubt and finally protests of politeness and joy as in certain plays by Molière where two actors monologue for a long time each on his side a few steps from one another. other, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and suddenly notice each other, cannot believe their eyes, interrupt their words, finally speak together, their hearts having followed the dialogue, and throw themselves into each other's arms one of the other. Mme de Villeparisis, out of discretion, wanted after a while to leave my grandmother who, on the contrary, preferred to keep her there until lunch, wanting to learn how she managed to get her mail earlier than us and good grilled meats (because Mme de Villeparisis, very greedy, had very little taste for the cuisine of the hotel where we were served meals that my grandmother, always quoting Madame de Sévigné, claimed to be ""starvingly magnificent""). And the Marquise got into the habit of coming every day, while waiting to be served, to sit down for a moment near us in the dining-room, without allowing us to get up or disturb ourselves in any way. At most, we often lingered to chat with her, our lunch over, at that sordid moment when the knives lay on the tablecloth next to the undone napkins. For my part, in order to keep, in order to be able to love Balbec, the idea that I was on the extreme point of the earth, I tried to look further, to see only the sea, to seek effects described by Baudelaire and to only let my eyes fall on our table on the days when some vast fish was served there, a sea monster, which, unlike the knives and forks, was contemporary with the primitive times when life was beginning to flow into the world. 'Ocean, in the time of the Cimmerians, and whose body with innumerable vertebrae, with blue and pink nerves, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the sea.","In the end we too formed a connexion, in spite of but through my grandmother, for she and Mme. de Villeparisis came in collision one morning in a doorway and were obliged to accost each other, not without having first exchanged gestures of surprise and hesitation, performed movements of recoil and uncertainty, and finally uttered protestations of joy and greeting, as in some of Molière's plays, where two actors who have been delivering long soliloquies from opposite sides of the stage, a few feet apart, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and then suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, break off what they are saying and finally address each other (the chorus having meanwhile kept the dialogue going) and fall into each other's arms. Mme. de Villeparisis was tactful, and made as if to leave my grandmother to herself after the first greetings, but my grandmother insisted on her staying to talk to her until luncheon, being anxious to discover how her friend managed to get her letters sent up to her earlier than we got ours, and to get such nice grilled things (for Mme. de Villeparisis, a great epicure, had the poorest opinion of the hotel kitchen which served us with meals that my grandmother, still quoting Mme. de Sévigné, described as ""of a magnificence to make you die of hunger."") And the Marquise formed the habit of coming every day, until her own meal was ready, to sit down for a moment at our table in the dining–room, insisting that we should not rise from our chairs or in any way put ourselves out. At the most we would linger, as often as not, in the room after finishing our luncheon, to talk to her, at that sordid moment when the knives are left littering the tablecloth among crumpled napkins. For my own part, so as to preserve (in order that I might be able to enjoy Balbec) the idea that I was on the uttermost promontory of the earth , I compelled myself to look farther afield, to notice only the sea, to seek in it the effects described by Baudelaire and to let my gaze fall upon our table only on days when there was set on it some gigantic fish, some marine monster, which unlike the knives and forks was contemporary with the primitive epochs in which the Ocean first began to teem with life, in the Cimmerians' time, a fish whose body with its numberless vertebrae, its blue veins and red, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the deep.","We too, eventually, found a friend, despite and because of my grandmother. She and Mme de Villeparisis, finding themselves face to face one morning in a doorway, were at last obliged to exchange greetings, but only after exchanging gestures of surprise and hesitation, going through a pantomime of standing back and doubting, then at length coming together with glad cries and polite exclamations, like a pair of actors in a scene by Molière who have been standing apart from one another, each delivering a soliloquy and supposedly not seeing the other, though there is no more than a few feet between them, and who suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, start speaking at the same time, interrupting each other, all this under the eyes of the chorus, before at last falling into each other’s arms. After a moment’s conversation, Mme de Villeparisis tried tactfully to pass on; but my grandmother suggested they sit together until lunch-time, with the aim of discovering how she managed to have her mail delivered earlier than we did and be treated to such excellent grills (as a connoisseur of fine cuisine, Mme de Villeparisis was unimpressed by the fare offered by the hotel, where we were served meals which my grandmother would describe, with one of her quotations from Mme de Sévigné, as ‘so sumptuous that you starve’).19 Every day from then on, the Marquise took to spending a moment with us in the dining-room, sitting at our table until her own meal was served, insisting that we not stand at her approach, that we should not put ourselves out in any way on her account. Sometimes, after we had finished eating, we sat on with her, chatting, at the squalid moment when knives and crumpled napkins lie about on the tablecloth. I sat there trying to look far beyond this scene, casting my eyes seaward in an attempt to preserve my attachment to Balbec and the idea that I was now on the farthest extremity of the land, scanning the waves for Baudelaire’s words and paying no attention to the table, unless it was one of those days when we were served a giant fish, a sea-monster which unlike the knives and forks came to us straight from the primitive ages when wildlife first began to teem in the Ocean, in the days of the Cimmerians,20 where its body with its countless vertebrae, its pink and blue nerves, though put together by Nature, had been built to an architectural design, like a polychromatic cathedral of the deep."
"Dans la confusion du salon, revenant de reconduire une visite, ou prenant une assiette de gâteaux pour les offrir à une autre, Mme Swann en passant près de moi, me prenait une seconde à part : « Je suis spécialement chargée par Gilberte de vous inviter à déjeuner pour après-demain. Comme je n’étais pas certaine de vous voir, j’allais vous écrire si vous n’étiez pas venu. » Je continuais à résister. Et cette résistance me coûtait de moins en moins, parce qu’on a beau aimer le poison qui vous fait du mal, quand on en est privé par quelque nécessité, depuis déjà un certain temps, on ne peut pas ne pas attacher quelque prix au repos qu’on ne connaissait plus, à l’absence d’émotions et de souffrances. Si l’on n’est pas tout à fait sincère en se disant qu’on ne voudra jamais revoir celle qu’on aime, on ne le serait pas non plus en disant qu’on veut la revoir. Car, sans doute, on ne peut supporter son absence qu’en se la promettant courte, en pensant au jour où on se retrouvera, mais d’autre part on sent à quel point ces rêves quotidiens d’une réunion prochaine et sans cesse ajournée sont moins douloureux que ne serait une entrevue qui pourrait être suivie de jalousie, de sorte que la nouvelle qu’on va revoir celle qu’on aime donnerait une commotion peu agréable. Ce qu’on recule maintenant de jour en jour, ce n’est plus la fin de l’intolérable anxiété causée par la séparation, c’est le recommencement redouté d’émotions sans issue. Comme à une telle entrevue on préfère le souvenir docile qu’on complète à son gré de rêveries où celle qui, dans la réalité, ne vous aime pas vous fait au contraire des déclarations, quand vous êtes tout seul ; ce souvenir qu’on peut arriver, en y mêlant peu à peu beaucoup de ce qu’on désire, à rendre aussi doux qu’on veut, comme on le préfère à l’entretien ajourné où on aurait affaire à un être à qui on ne dicterait plus à son gré les paroles qu’on désire, mais dont on subirait les nouvelles froideurs, les violences inattendues. Nous savons tous, quand nous n’aimons plus, que l’oubli, même le souvenir vague ne causent pas tant de souffrances que l’amour malheureux. C’est d’un tel oubli anticipé que je préférais sans me l’avouer, la reposante douceur.","In the confusion of the living room, returning from a visit, or taking a plate of cakes to offer to someone else, Mme Swann, passing close to me, took me aside for a second: ""I have been specially instructed by Gilberte to invite you for lunch the day after tomorrow. As I was not sure to see you, I was going to write to you if you had not come. I continued to resist. And this resistance cost me less and less, because however much one loves the poison that hurts you, when one has been deprived of it by some necessity, for some time already, one cannot fail to attach some value to the rest that we no longer knew, to the absence of emotions and suffering. If we are not completely sincere in telling ourselves that we will never want to see the one we love again, we would not be sincere either in saying that we want to see her again. Because, no doubt, one can bear one's absence only by promising it to be short, by thinking of the day when one will meet again, but on the other hand one feels to what extent these daily dreams of an upcoming and constantly adjourned meeting are less painful than would be an interview which could be followed by jealousy, so that the news that one is going to see the one one loves again would give an unpleasant shock. What we are now putting off day by day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded resumption of emotions without exit. As to such an interview one prefers the docile memory which one completes at will with daydreams where the one who, in reality, does not love you, on the contrary, makes declarations to you, when you are all alone; this memory that one can manage, by gradually mixing in much of what one desires, to make as sweet as one wants, as one prefers to the adjourned interview where one would be dealing with a being with whom one would no longer dictate at will the words one desires, but from which one would suffer the new coldness, the unexpected violence. We all know, when we no longer love, that forgetting, even vague memories, do not cause so much suffering as unhappy love. It is from such anticipated oblivion that I preferred, without admitting it to myself, restful sweetness.","In the confusion of her drawing–room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to 'tempt' another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: ""I have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to–morrow. As I wasn't sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn't come. "" I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one's pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one's pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked–for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill–starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity.","Amid the jostle of people in her drawing-room, as she came back in from seeing someone out or handed round a plate of cakes, Mme Swann would take me aside for a moment: ‘Gilberte has most particularly urged me to invite you to lunch the day after tomorrow. I didn’t know whether I would see you or not, so I was going to drop you a note about it if you didn’t come today.’ I persisted in my resistance to Gilberte’s invitations. This resistance was now costing me less and less: however much one may savour one’s poison, when one has been forcibly deprived of it for any length of time , one is bound to be struck by how restful it can be to do without it, by the absence of excitements and sorrows. We may be not entirely sincere in hoping never again to see the woman we love; but the same may well be true when we say we do hope to see her again. Of course, any absence from her can only be bearable if we mean it to be brief, if we keep thinking of being together again with her one day; but against that, we are aware of how much less disturbing these daily dreams of prompt but ever deferred reunion are than a real encounter with her would be, with its likely resurgence of jealousy; and so the knowledge that one is going to see her again could cause a recurrence of upsetting emotions. And what we keep postponing now day after day is no longer an end to the unbearable anguish of separation, but the dreaded renewal of futile feelings. How preferable the malleable memory of her seems: instead of the real meeting with her, in your solitude you can dramatize a dream in which the girl who is not in love with you assures you that she is! This memory, which can become as sweet as possible, by being gradually flavoured with what you most desire, is far better than the future encounter with a person whose words will be put into her mouth not by you, but by her foreseeable indifference and even her unforeseeable animosity. To be no longer in love is to know that forgetting – or even a fading memory – causes much less pain than the unhappiness of loving. What I preferred, without admitting it to myself, was the reposeful promise of that foreshadowed forgetting."
"« J’aurais été si content de les connaître, dis-je à Elstir en arrivant près de lui. – Aussi pourquoi restez-vous à des lieues ? » Ce furent les paroles qu’il prononça, non qu’elles exprimassent sa pensée, puisque si son désir avait été d’exaucer le mien, m’appeler lui eût été bien facile, mais peut-être parce qu’il avait entendu des phrases de ce genre, familier aux gens vulgaires pris en faute, et parce que même les grands hommes sont, en certaines choses, pareils aux gens vulgaires, prennent les excuses journalières dans le même répertoire qu’eux, comme le pain quotidien chez le même boulanger ; soit que de telles paroles qui doivent en quelque sorte être lues à l’envers, puisque leur lettre signifie le contraire de la vérité, soient l’effet nécessaire, le graphique négatif d’un réflexe. « Elles étaient pressées. » Je pensai que surtout elles l’avaient empêché d’appeler quelqu’un qui leur était peu sympathique ; sans cela il n’y eût pas manqué, après toutes les questions que je lui avais posées sur elles, et l’intérêt qu’il avait bien vu que je leur portais.","“I would have been so glad to have known them,” I said to Elstir as I approached him. ""So why do you stay miles away?"" These were the words he uttered, not that they expressed his thoughts, since if his wish had been to grant mine, calling me would have been very easy for him, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this kind, familiar to vulgar people caught in the act, and because even great men are in some respects like vulgar people, take daily excuses from the same repertoire as them, like daily bread from the same baker ; or that such words, which must in some way be read backwards, since their letter signifies the opposite of the truth, are the necessary effect, the negative graphic of a reflex. “They were in a hurry. I thought that above all they had prevented him from calling someone who was unsympathetic to them; otherwise he wouldn't have failed, after all the questions I had asked him about them, and the interest he had clearly seen that I took them.","""I did so much want to know them,"" I said as I reached Elstir. "" Then why did you stand a mile away? "" These were his actual words, not that they expressed what was in his mind, since, if his desire had been to grant mine, to call me up to him would have been quite easy, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this sort, in familiar use among common people when they are in the wrong, and because even great men are in certain respects much the same as common people, take their everyday excuses from the same common stock just as they get their daily bread from the same baker; or it may be that such expressions (which ought, one might almost say, to be read 'backwards,' since their literal interpretation is the opposite of the truth) are the instantaneous effect, the negative exposure of a reflex action. ""They were in a hurry. "" It struck me that of course they must have stopped him from summoning a person who did not greatly attract them; otherwise he would not have failed, after all the questions that I had put to him about them, and the interest which he must have seen that I took in them, to call me.","‘I would have been so happy to meet them,’ I said to Elstir as I came up with him. ‘ Well, in that case what did you stand miles away for?’ Those were the words he spoke, not because they expressed his own mind, since if he had intended to grant my unspoken wish, it would have been easy for him to call me over; but possibly because they were one of those phrases he had heard, used by vulgar people who think they are in the wrong, and because even great men are like vulgar people in some things, taking their everyday excuses from the same repertoire, as they buy their daily bread from the same baker; or possibly because such words, which must in a sense be read back to front, since the letter of them means the opposite of their truth, are the necessary effect, the negative graph, as it were, of a reflex. ‘Anyway, they were in a hurry.’ I was sure they must have prevented him from introducing someone they saw as dislikable: otherwise he would have been bound to call me over, after all the questions I had asked about them, and the interest he could see I took in them."

"Ma grand’mère me témoignait, parce que maintenant je m’intéressais extrêmement au golf et au tennis et laissais échapper l’occasion de regarder travailler et entendre discourir un artiste qu’elle savait des plus grands, un mépris qui me semblait procéder de vues un peu étroites. J’avais autrefois entrevu aux Champs-Élysées et je m’étais rendu mieux compte depuis qu’en étant amoureux d’une femme nous projetons simplement en elle un état de notre âme ; que par conséquent l’important n’est pas la valeur de la femme mais la profondeur de l’état ; et que les émotions qu’une jeune fille médiocre nous donne peuvent nous permettre de faire monter à notre conscience des parties plus intimes de nous-même, plus personnelles, plus lointaines, plus essentielles, que ne ferait le plaisir que nous donne la conversation d’un homme supérieur ou même la contemplation admirative de ses œuvres.","My grandmother testified to me, because now I was extremely interested in golf and tennis and missed the opportunity to watch work and hear an artist she knew to be among the greatest, a contempt which seemed to me to proceed from views a bit narrow. I had once glimpsed the Champs-Élysées and had since realized better that by being in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our soul; that consequently the important thing is not the value of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions that a mediocre young girl gives us can enable us to raise to our awareness more intimate parts of ourselves, more personal, more distant, more essential, than would the pleasure that the conversation gives us would give us. 'a superior man or even the admiring contemplation of his works.","Meanwhile my grandmother was shewing, because now I was keenly interested in golf and lawn–tennis and was letting slip an opportunity of seeing at work and hearing talk an artist whom she knew to be one of the greatest of his time, a disapproval which seemed to me to be based on somewhat narrow views. I had guessed long ago in the Champs–Elysées, and had since established to my own satisfaction, that when we are in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our own soul, that the important thing is, therefore, not the worth of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions which a young girl of no kind of distinction arouses in us can enable us to bring to the surface of our consciousness some of the most intimate parts of our being, more personal, more remote, more essential than would be reached by the pleasure that we derive from the conversation of a great man or even from the admiring contemplation of his work.","My grandmother, because I had now developed an acute interest in golf and tennis, which was preventing me from seizing the opportunity of going to watch an artist at work – an artist she knew to be among the greatest – and listen to his talk, now treated me with scorn, which seemed to me very narrow-minded of her. At the Champs-Élysées I had had an inkling, which since those days had become clearer to me, that when we are in love with a woman, all we are doing is projecting on to her a state of our own self; that consequently what is important is not the merit of the woman, but the intensity of that state; and that the emotions which a mediocre young girl can give us may enable us to bring up to consciousness elements of ourself which are more private and personal, more remote and essential than anything which we may acquire from the conversation of an extraordinary man, or even the admiration with which we gaze at his works."

"– Certainement si ; fût-ce de ce qu’elle appelait « choses si légères qu’il n’y a que vous et moi qui les remarquions ». Et en tous cas, elle était près d’elle. Et La Bruyère nous dit que c’est tout : « Être près des gens qu’on aime, leur parler, ne leur parler point, tout est égal. » Il a raison ; c’est le seul bonheur, ajouta M. de Charlus d’une voix mélancolique ; et ce bonheur-là, hélas, la vie est si mal arrangée qu’on le goûte bien rarement ; Mme de Sévigné a été en somme moins à plaindre que d’autres. Elle a passé une grande partie de sa vie auprès de ce qu’elle aimait.","– Certainly so; even if it was what she called “things so slight that only you and I noticed them”. And in any case, she was close to her. And La Bruyère tells us that is all: “To be close to the people you love, to talk to them, not to talk to them, everything is equal. "" He is right ; it is the only happiness,” added M. de Charlus in a melancholy voice; and that happiness, alas, life is so badly arranged that one tastes it very rarely; Madame de Sévigné was on the whole less to be pitied than others. She spent a large part of her life with what she loved.","""Most certainly she had: if it was only what she calls 'things so slight that nobody else would notice them but you and me.'

He is right; that is the only form of happiness,"" added M. de Charlus in a mournful voice, ""and that happiness—alas, life is so ill arranged that one very rarely tastes it; Mme. de Sévigné was after all less to be pitied than most of us. She spent a great part of her life with the person whom she loved.""","She would have said the sort of things which she says are “so slight that none, save you and I , ever notices them”.61 And in any case, she was with her, which as La Bruyère says is the most essential thing in life: “ To be with those one loves is enough: to talk with them or not to talk with them is all the same.”62 He’s right – it is the only happiness, he added in a melancholy tone. Life is, alas, so badly arranged that we rarely enjoy that happiness. Mme de Sévigné was actually better off than most: she spent much of her life with a loved one."
"Cependant on était passé à table. À côté de mon assiette je trouvai un œillet dont la tige était enveloppée dans du papier d’argent. Il m’embarrassa moins que n’avait fait l’enveloppe remise dans l’antichambre et que j’avais complètement oubliée. L’usage, pourtant aussi nouveau pour moi, me parut plus intelligible quand je vis tous les convives masculins s’emparer d’un œillet semblable qui accompagnait leur couvert et l’introduire dans la boutonnière de leur redingote. Je fis comme eux avec cet air naturel d’un libre penseur dans une église, lequel ne connaît pas la messe, mais se lève quand tout le monde se lève et se met à genoux un peu après que tout le monde s’est mis à genoux. Un autre usage inconnu et moins éphémère me déplut davantage. De l’autre côté de mon assiette il y en avait une plus petite remplie d’une matière noirâtre que je ne savais pas être du caviar. J’étais ignorant de ce qu’il fallait en faire, mais résolu à n’en pas manger.","However, we had gone to table. Beside my plate I found a carnation, the stem of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope put back in the antechamber and which I had completely forgotten. The custom, however new to me, seemed more intelligible to me when I saw all the male guests seize a similar carnation that accompanied their cutlery and insert it into the buttonhole of their frock coat. I did like them with that natural air of a free thinker in a church, who does not know the mass, but gets up when everyone gets up and kneels a little after everyone has started to knees. Another unknown and less ephemeral use displeased me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller one filled with a blackish material that I didn't know was caviar. I was ignorant of what to do with it, but resolved not to eat it.","Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper.

This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free–thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare.

Though also new to me, the meaning of this custom soon became clearer, when I saw all the other men at the table pick up carnations lying beside their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their frock-coats. I did the same, with the casual air of the atheist in church, who, though knowing nothing about the service, stands up when the others stand, and kneels with only a moment’s delay when everybody else kneels. Another custom, just as unfamiliar to me but more lasting, was less to my taste. Just to the right of my plate was a smaller dish full of a blackish substance which, unknown to me, was caviar. I had no idea what one was supposed to do with it; but I was determined not to eat any of it."

"Si j’avais déjà commencé d’explorer avec ces tressaillements de respect et de joie le domaine féerique qui contre toute attente avait ouvert devant moi ses avenues jusque-là fermées, pourtant c’était seulement en tant qu’ami de Gilberte. Le royaume dans lequel j’étais accueilli était contenu lui-même dans un plus mystérieux encore où Swann et sa femme menaient leur vie surnaturelle, et vers lequel ils se dirigeaient après m’avoir serré la main quand ils traversaient en même temps que moi, en sens inverse, l’antichambre. Mais bientôt je pénétrai aussi au cœur du Sanctuaire. Par exemple, Gilberte n’était pas là, M. ou Mme Swann se trouvait à la maison. Ils avaient demandé qui avait sonné, et apprenant que c’était moi, m’avaient fait prier d’entrer un instant auprès d’eux, désirant que j’usasse dans tel ou tel sens, pour une chose ou pour une autre, de mon influence sur leur fille. Je me rappelais cette lettre si complète, si persuasive, que j’avais naguère écrite à Swann et à laquelle il n’avait même pas daigné répondre. J’admirais l’impuissance de l’esprit, du raisonnement et du cœur à opérer la moindre conversion, à résoudre une seule de ces difficultés, qu’ensuite la vie, sans qu’on sache seulement comment elle s’y est prise, dénoue si aisément. Ma position nouvelle d’ami de Gilberte, doué sur elle d’une excellente influence, me faisait maintenant bénéficier de la même faveur que si ayant eu pour camarade, dans un collège où on m’eût classé toujours premier, le fils d’un roi, j’avais dû à ce hasard mes petites entrées au Palais et des audiences dans la salle du trône ; Swann, avec une bienveillance infinie et comme s’il n’avait pas été surchargé d’occupations glorieuses, me faisait entrer dans sa bibliothèque et m’y laissait pendant une heure répondre par des balbutiements, des silences de timidité coupés de brefs et incohérents élans de courage, à des propos dont mon émoi m’empêchait de comprendre un seul mot ; il me montrait des objets d’art et des livres qu’il jugeait susceptibles de m’intéresser et dont je ne doutais pas d’avance qu’ils ne passassent infiniment en beauté tous ceux que possèdent le Louvre et la Bibliothèque Nationale, mais qu’il m’était impossible de regarder. À ces moments-là son maître d’hôtel m’aurait fait plaisir en me demandant de lui donner ma montre, mon épingle de cravate, mes bottines et de signer un acte qui le reconnaissait pour mon héritier : selon la belle expression populaire dont, comme pour les plus célèbres épopées, on ne connaît pas l’auteur, mais qui comme elles et contrairement à la théorie de Wolf en a eu certainement un (un de ces esprits inventifs et modestes ainsi qu’il s’en rencontre chaque année, lesquels font des trouvailles telles que « mettre un nom sur une figure » ; mais leur nom à eux, ils ne le font pas connaître), je ne savais plus ce que je faisais. Tout au plus m’étonnais-je quand la visite se prolongeait, à quel néant de réalisation, à quelle absence de conclusion heureuse, conduisaient ces heures vécues dans la demeure enchantée. Mais ma déception ne tenait ni à l’insuffisance des chefs-d’œuvre montrés, ni à l’impossibilité d’arrêter sur eux un regard distrait. Car ce n’était pas la beauté intrinsèque des choses qui me rendait miraculeux d’être dans le cabinet de Swann, c’était l’adhérence à ces choses – qui eussent pu être les plus laides du monde – du sentiment particulier, triste et voluptueux que j’y localisais depuis tant d’années et qui l’imprégnait encore ; de même la multitude des miroirs, des brosses d’argent, des autels à saint Antoine de Padoue sculptés et peints par les plus grands artistes, ses amis, n’étaient pour rien dans le sentiment de mon indignité et de sa bienveillance royale qui m’était inspirés quand Mme Swann me recevait un moment dans sa chambre où trois belles et imposantes créatures, sa première, sa deuxième et sa troisième femmes de chambre préparaient en souriant des toilettes merveilleuses, et vers laquelle, sur l’ordre proféré par le valet de pied en culotte courte que Madame désirait me dire un mot, je me dirigeais par le sentier sinueux d’un couloir tout embaumé à distance des essences précieuses qui exhalaient sans cesse du cabinet de toilette leurs effluves odoriférants.","If I had already begun to explore with these thrills of respect and joy the magical domain which against all expectation had opened before me its hitherto closed avenues, yet it was only as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom in which I was welcomed was itself contained in an even more mysterious one where Swann and his wife were leading their supernatural life, and towards which they were heading after shaking my hand when they crossed at the same time as me, in the opposite direction, the antechamber. But soon I also entered the heart of the Sanctuary. For example, Gilberte was not there, Mr. or Mrs. Swann was at home. They had asked who had rung, and learning that it was me, had begged me to enter a moment near them, desiring that I use in such and such a way, for one thing or another, to my influence on their daughter. I remembered that letter, so complete, so persuasive, which I had recently written to Swann and to which he had not even deigned to reply. I admired the powerlessness of the mind, the reasoning and the heart to effect the slightest conversion, to resolve a single one of these difficulties, that then life, without anyone even knowing how it came about, unravels so easily. My new position as a friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, now made me enjoy the same favor as if, having had as a comrade, in a college where I would always have been ranked first, the son of a King, I owed my little visits to the Palace and audiences in the throne room to this chance; Swann, with infinite benevolence and as if he had not been overloaded with glorious occupations, let me into his library and let me answer there for an hour with stammerings, timid silences interrupted by brief and incoherent outbursts of courage, at remarks of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; he showed me works of art and books which he considered likely to interest me and which I had no doubt in advance would exceed infinitely in beauty all those possessed by the Louvre and the National Library, but which it was impossible for me to watch. At such times his butler would have pleased me by asking me to give him my watch, my tie pin, my boots and to sign an act recognizing him as my heir: according to the beautiful popular expression of which, as for the most famous epics, we do not know the author, but who like them and contrary to Wolf's theory certainly had one (one of those inventive and modest minds as one meets each year, who make finds such as ""putting a name on a figure""; but their own name, they do not make it known), I no longer knew what I was doing. At most I was surprised when the visit was prolonged, to what nothingness of realization, to what absence of happy conclusion, led these hours lived in the enchanted residence. But my disappointment was not due to the insufficiency of the masterpieces shown, nor to the impossibility of fixing a distracted gaze on them. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of things that made me miraculous to be in Swann's study, it was the clinging to these things - which could have been the ugliest in the world - of the particular feeling, sad and voluptuous that I had located there for so many years and that still impregnated it; in the same way the multitude of mirrors, silver brushes, altars to Saint Anthony of Padua sculpted and painted by the greatest artists, his friends, had nothing to do with the feeling of my indignity and his royal benevolence which I was inspired when Madame Swann received me for a moment in her room where three beautiful and imposing creatures, her first, her second and her third maids were preparing, smiling, marvelous toilets, and towards which, on the order proffered by the valet From foot to toe that Madame wanted to say a word to me, I headed down the winding path of a perfumed corridor at a distance from the precious essences that constantly exhaled their odoriferous scents from the bathroom.","If I had now begun to explore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one's so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne–room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over–burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann's butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie–pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular expression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as 'putting a name to a face,' though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann's library, it was the attachment to those objects—which might have been the ugliest in the world—of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver–backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee–breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing–room a fragrance exquisitely sweet.","Though I had begun, full of this tremulous respect and joy, to explore the enchanted domain which had just given me the freedom of its hitherto forbidden avenues, it was only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The realm in which I was now welcomed was itself encompassed by another even more mysterious one, in which Swann and his wife had their supernatural being, and which, if we chanced to meet, going through the ante-room in our different directions, closed behind them again, as soon as they had shaken my hand. However, soon I too had access to their Inner Sanctum. For instance, if Gilberte was not at home but her parents were, they would ask who it was at the door; and having been told it was me, they would have me sent in to see them, with the aim of asking me to influence their daughter towards a certain course of action in some matter or other. I remembered the exhaustive, persuasive screed which I had not long since sent to M. Swann, and to which he had never deigned to reply. I was struck by the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart in bringing about the slightest change in people, in reducing a single one of the difficulties which life, left to its own devices and in ways that escape us, manages to resolve so easily. My new status as friend of Gilberte, capable of influencing her for the better, put me in the favourable position of someone who happened to be the school-friend of a king’s son, as well as being always top of the class, and who, because of those fortuitous facts, now has the run of the Palace and private audiences in the Throne-room: with infinite kindness, and as though he was not much occupied with lofty considerations, Swann would usher me into his study and speak to me for an hour about things which my state of emotional turmoil prevented me from understanding a single word of, and to which I could reply only with stammerings, diffident dumbness and sudden daring outbursts of short-winded incoherence; thinking they might interest me, he showed me books and finely wrought objects, the beauty of which, I was prospectively convinced, must infinitely surpass all the holdings of the Louvre and the Bibliothèque nationale, impossible though it was for me to view these. At such moments, the Swanns’ butler would have endeared himself to me had he asked me to hand over my watch, my tie-pin and my boots, or if he had begged me to sign a deed recognizing him as my heir. The state I was in is described perfectly by a fine colloquialism – I didn’t know whether I was coming or going! – the coiner of which is as unknown as the author of the greatest epic poems, but which, like them, and pace the theory of Wolf,33 must have had an originator, one of those modest creative spirits who turn up every now and then to enrich the rest of us with a felicitous expression like ‘putting a name to a face’, but whose own face we can never put a name to. However long I was closeted with Swann, all I ever got from these moments was a feeling of surprise at the utter non-achievement they led to, the total lack of satisfying outcome I derived from the hours spent in the enchanted dwelling. Not that my disappointment came from any deficiency in the masterpieces he showed me, or the impossibility of forcing my distracted eye to focus on them. It was not the intrinsic beauty of these things which made it miraculous for me to be in Swann’s study; it was that, adhering to the things (which could have been the ugliest imaginable), there was the special, sad, thrilling emotion which I had invested in this place for so many years, and of which it was still redolent. Nor was it Mme Swann’s multitude of mirrors, silver brushes and little shrines to Saint Anthony of Padua, painted or sculpted by friends of hers who counted among the finest artists, which filled me with the knowledge of my unworthiness and her own regal graciousness, whenever she received me for a moment in her room, where three beautiful and imposing creatures, her first, her second and her third maids, were smiling and laying out wonderful garments, and to which I wended my way, when the footman in breeches and hose had conveyed to me the injunction that Madame wished to speak to me, along a winding corridor that was remotely perfumed by the precious essences wafting the constant current of their sweet scents all the way from her dressing-room."

"Je crus d’abord que j’y échouerais. Comme elle devait rester fort longtemps encore à Balbec et moi aussi, j’avais trouvé que le mieux était de ne pas trop chercher à la voir et d’attendre une occasion qui me fît la rencontrer. Mais cela arrivât-il tous les jours, il était fort à craindre qu’elle se contentât de répondre de loin à mon salut, lequel dans ce cas, répété quotidiennement pendant toute la saison, ne m’avancerait à rien.","At first I thought I would fail. As she was to remain at Balbec for a very long time to come, and so did I, I had found it best not to try too hard to see her and to wait for an opportunity to meet her. But were that to happen every day, it was very much to be feared that she would content herself with answering my greeting from afar, which in this case, repeated daily throughout the season, would do me no good.","I thought at first that I should fail. As she was to be staying (and I too) for a long time still at Balbec, I had decided that the best thing was not to make my efforts to meet her too apparent, but to wait for an accidental encounter. But should this occur every day, even, it was greatly to be feared that she would confine herself to acknowledging my bow from a distance, and such meetings, repeated day after day throughout the whole season, would benefit me not at all.","I thought at first that I was going to fail in this aim. As she was going to be staying in Balbec for quite a while, as I was myself, I had decided that it would be better not to seek her out too directly, but wait for an opportunity when circumstances would bring us together. However, if that were to happen every day, it was very likely that she would do no more than greet me without stopping, and by the end of the season I would be no further forward."
"Mais les demoiselles Bloch et leur frère rougirent jusqu’aux oreilles tant ils furent impressionnés quand Bloch père, pour se montrer royal jusqu’au bout envers les deux « labadens » de son fils, donna l’ordre d’apporter du champagne et annonça négligemment que pour nous « régaler », il avait fait prendre trois fauteuils pour la représentation qu’une troupe d’Opéra Comique donnait le soir même au Casino. Il regrettait de n’avoir pu avoir de loge. Elles étaient toutes prises. D’ailleurs il les avait souvent expérimentées, on était mieux à l’orchestre. Seulement, si le défaut de son fils, c’est-à-dire ce que son fils croyait invisible aux autres, était la grossièreté, celui du père était l’avarice. Aussi, c’est dans une carafe qu’il fit servir sous le nom de champagne un petit vin mousseux et sous celui de fauteuils d’orchestre il avait fait prendre des parterres qui coûtaient moitié moins, miraculeusement persuadé par l’intervention divine de son défaut que ni à table, ni au théâtre (où toutes les loges étaient vides) on ne s’apercevrait de la différence. Quand M. Bloch nous eut laissé tremper nos lèvres dans les coupes plates que son fils décorait du nom de « cratères aux flancs profondément creusés », il nous fit admirer un tableau qu’il aimait tant qu’il l’apportait avec lui à Balbec. Il nous dit que c’était un Rubens. Saint-Loup lui demanda naïvement s’il était signé. M. Bloch répondit en rougissant qu’il avait fait couper la signature à cause du cadre, ce qui n’avait pas d’importance, puisqu’il ne voulait pas le vendre. Puis il nous congédia rapidement pour se plonger dans le Journal Officiel dont les numéros encombraient la maison et dont la lecture lui était rendue nécessaire, nous dit-il, « par sa situation parlementaire » sur la nature exacte de laquelle il ne nous fournit pas de lumières. « Je prends un foulard, nous dit Bloch, car Zéphyros et Boréas se disputent à qui mieux mieux la mer poissonneuse, et pour peu que nous nous attardions après le spectacle, nous ne rentrerons qu’aux premières lueurs d’Eôs aux doigts de pourpre. À propos, demanda-t-il à Saint-Loup, quand nous fûmes dehors (et je tremblai car je compris bien vite que c’était de M. de Charlus que Bloch parlait sur ce ton ironique), quel était cet excellent fantoche en costume sombre que je vous ai vu promener avant-hier matin sur la plage ? – C’est mon oncle », répondit Saint-Loup piqué. Malheureusement, une « gaffe » était bien loin de paraître à Bloch chose à éviter. Il se tordit de rire : « Tous mes compliments, j’aurais dû le deviner, il a un excellent chic, et une impayable bobine de gaga de la plus haute lignée. – Vous vous trompez du tout au tout, il est très intelligent, riposta Saint-Loup furieux. – Je le regrette car alors il est moins complet. J’aimerais du reste beaucoup le connaître car je suis sûr que j’écrirais des machines adéquates sur des bonshommes comme ça. Celui-là, à voir passer, est crevant. Mais je négligerais le côté caricatural, au fond assez méprisable pour un artiste épris de la beauté plastique des phrases, de la binette qui, excusez-moi, m’a fait gondoler un bon moment, et je mettrais en relief le côté aristocratique de votre oncle, qui en somme fait un effet bœuf, et la première rigolade passée, frappe par un très grand style. Mais, dit-il, en s’adressant cette fois à moi, il y a une chose, dans un tout autre ordre d’idées, sur laquelle je veux t’interroger et chaque fois que nous sommes ensemble, quelque dieu, bienheureux habitant de l’Olympe, me fait oublier totalement de te demander ce renseignement qui eût pu m’être déjà et me sera sûrement fort utile. Quelle est donc cette belle personne avec laquelle je t’ai rencontré au Jardin d’Acclimatation et qui était accompagnée d’un monsieur que je crois connaître de vue et d’une jeune fille à la longue chevelure ? » J’avais bien vu que Mme Swann ne se rappelait pas le nom de Bloch, puisqu’elle m’en avait dit un autre et avait qualifié mon camarade d’attaché à un ministère où je n’avais jamais pensé depuis à m’informer s’il était entré. Mais comment Bloch qui, à ce qu’elle m’avait dit alors, s’était fait présenter à elle pouvait-il ignorer son nom. J’étais si étonné que je restai un moment sans répondre. « En tous cas, tous mes compliments, me dit-il, tu n’as pas dû t’embêter avec elle. Je l’avais rencontrée quelques jours auparavant dans le train de Ceinture. Elle voulut bien dénouer la sienne en faveur de ton serviteur, je n’ai jamais passé de si bons moments et nous allions prendre toutes dispositions pour nous revoir quand une personne qu’elle connaissait eut le mauvais goût de monter à l’avant-dernière station. » Le silence que je gardai ne parut pas plaire à Bloch. « J’espérais, me dit-il, connaître grâce à toi son adresse et aller goûter chez elle, plusieurs fois par semaine, les plaisirs d’Éros, chers aux Dieux, mais je n’insiste pas puisque tu poses pour la discrétion à l’égard d’une professionnelle qui s’est donnée à moi trois fois de suite et de la manière la plus raffinée entre Paris et le Point-du-Jour. Je la retrouverai bien un soir ou l’autre. »","But the Bloch ladies and their brother blushed to the ears as they were so impressed when Bloch senior, to show himself royal to the end towards his son's two ""labadens"", gave the order to bring champagne and carelessly announced that in order to 'regale' us, he had had three armchairs taken for the performance which a troupe of the Opéra Comique was giving that very evening at the Casino. He regretted not having been able to have a box. They were all taken. Besides, he had often experimented with them, we were better in the orchestra. Only, if the fault of his son, that is to say what his son believed invisible to others, was coarseness, that of the father was avarice. Also, it was in a decanter that he had a small sparkling wine served under the name of champagne and under that of orchestra seats he had had flowerbeds taken which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his but neither at the table nor in the theater (where all the boxes were empty) would you notice the difference. When M. Bloch had let us soak our lips in the flat cups which his son decorated with the name of ""craters with deeply hollowed sides"", he made us admire a painting which he loved so much that he brought it with him to Balbec. . He tells us it was a Rubens. Saint-Loup naively asked him if it was signed. Mr. Bloch replied blushing that he had had the signature cut off because of the frame, which did not matter, since he did not want to sell it. Then he dismissed us quickly to delve into the Official Journal, the numbers of which cluttered the house and the reading of which was made necessary for him, he told us, ""by his parliamentary situation"" on the exact nature of which he does not provide us with any information. lights. ""I'm taking a scarf, Bloch tells us, because Zephyros and Boreas are arguing over the fishy sea, and if we linger after the show, we won't return until the first light of Eôs with purple fingers . By the way, he asked Saint-Loup when we were outside (and I trembled because I quickly realized that it was M. de Charlus that Bloch was talking about in that ironic tone), who was this excellent puppet in dark suit that I saw you walking on the beach the morning before yesterday? ""He's my uncle,"" replied Saint-Loup, piqued. Unfortunately, a ""blunder"" was far from appearing to Bloch as something to be avoided. He laughed his ass off, ""All my compliments, I should have guessed, he's got excellent chic, and a priceless top-line gaga reel."" “You are completely mistaken, he is very intelligent,” retorted Saint-Loup furiously. – I regret it because then it is less complete. I would like to know him very much because I am sure that I would write adequate machines on fellows like that. This one, to see pass, is exhausting. But I would neglect the caricatural side, basically quite contemptible for an artist enamored with the plastic beauty of sentences, of the smiley face which, excuse me, made me curl for a while, and I would highlight the aristocratic side of your uncle, who in short makes an effect jam, and the first laugh passed, strikes by a very great style. But, he said, addressing me this time, there is something in a completely different order of ideas that I want to ask you about and each time we are together, some god, blessed inhabitant de l'Olympe, makes me completely forget to ask you for this information which could have already been given to me and will surely be very useful to me. Who is this beautiful person with whom I met you at the Jardin d'Acclimatation and who was accompanied by a gentleman whom I believe I know by sight and a young girl with long hair? I had clearly seen that Madame Swann did not remember Bloch's name, since she had given me another name and had described my comrade as attached to a ministry to which I had never thought since. inform if he had entered. But how could Bloch, who, so she told me then, had been introduced to her, could not know her name. I was so surprised that I didn't answer for a moment. “Anyway, all my compliments, he said to me, you must not have bothered with her. I had met her a few days earlier on the Belt train. She wanted to untie hers in favor of your servant, I have never had such good times and we were going to make all the arrangements to see each other again when a person she knew had the bad taste to go up to the penultimate station. The silence I maintained did not seem to please Bloch. ""I was hoping,"" he said to me, ""to know her address thanks to you and to go and taste at her house, several times a week, the pleasures of Eros, dear to the gods, but I won't insist since you pose for discretion at towards a professional who has given herself to me three times in a row and in the most refined way between Paris and the Point-du-Jour. I'll see her again one night or the other. »","But the Misses Bloch and their brother reddened to the tips of their ears, so much impressed were they when Bloch senior, to shew that he could be regal to the last in his entertainment of his son's two 'chums,' gave the order for champagne to be served, and announced casually that, as a treat for us, he had taken three stalls for the performance which a company from the Opéra–Comique was giving that evening at the Casino. He was sorry that he had not been able to get a box. They had all been taken. However, he had often been in the boxes, and really one saw and heard better down by the orchestra. All very well, only, if the defect of his son, that is to say the defect which his son believed to be invisible to other people, was coarseness, the father's was avarice. And so it was in a decanter that we were served with, under the name of champagne, a light sparkling wine, while under that of orchestra stalls he had taken three in the pit, which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his defect that neither at table nor in the theatre (where the boxes were all empty) would the defect be noticed. When M. Bloch had let us moisten our lips in the flat glasses which his son dignified with the style and title of 'craters with deeply hollowed flanks,' he made us admire a picture to which he was so much attached that he had brought it with him to Balbec. He told us that it was a Rubens. Saint–Loup asked innocently if it was signed. M. Bloch replied, blushing, that he had had the signature cut off to make it fit the frame, but that it made no difference, as he had no intention of selling the picture. Then he hurriedly bade us good–night, in order to bury himself in the Journal Officiel, back numbers of which littered the house, and which, he informed us, he was obliged to read carefully on account of his 'parliamentary position' as to the precise nature of which, however, he gave us no enlightenment. ""I shall take a muffler,"" said Bloch, ""for Zephyrus and Boreas are disputing to which of them shall belong the fish–teeming sea, and should we but tarry a little after the show is over, we shall not be home before the first flush of Eos, the rosy–fingered. By the way,"" he asked Saint–Loup when we were outside, and I trembled, for I realised at once that it was of M. de Charlus that Bloch was speaking in that tone of irony, ""who was that excellent old card dressed in black that I saw you walking with, the day before yesterday, on the beach?"" ""That was my uncle."" Saint–Loup was ruffled. Unfortunately, a 'floater' was far from seeming to Bloch a thing to be avoided. He shook with laughter. "" Heartiest congratulations; I ought to have guessed; he has an excellent style, the most priceless dial of an old 'gaga' of the highest lineage."" ""You are absolutely mistaken; he is an extremely clever man,"" retorted Saint–Loup, now furious. ""I am sorry about that; it makes him less complete. All the same, I should like very much to know him, for I flatter myself I could write some highly adequate pieces about old buffers like that. Just to see him go by, he's killing. But I should leave out of account the caricaturable side, which really is hardly worthy of an artist enamoured of the plastic beauty of phrases, of his mug, which (you'll forgive me) doubled me up for a moment with joyous laughter, and I should bring into prominence the aristocratic side of your uncle, who after all has a distinct bovine effect, and when one has finished laughing does impress one by his great air of style. But,"" he went on, addressing myself this time, ""there is also a matter of a very different order about which I have been meaning to question you, and every time we are together, some god, blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to ask for a piece of information which might before now have been and is sure some day to be of the greatest use to me. Tell me, who was the lovely lady I saw you with in the Jardin d'Acclimatation accompanied by a gentleman whom I seem to know by sight and a little girl with long hair? "" It had been quite plain to me at the time that Mme. Swann did not remember Bloch's name, since she had spoken of him by another, and had described my friend as being on the staff of some Ministry, as to which I had never since then thought of finding out whether he had joined it. But how came it that Bloch, who, according to what she then told me, had got himself introduced to her, was ignorant of her name? I was so much surprised that I stopped for a moment before answering. ""Whoever she is,"" he went on, ""hearty congratulations; you can't have been bored with her. I picked her up a few days before that on the Zone railway, where, speaking of zones, she was so kind as to undo hers for the benefit of your humble servant; I have never had such a time in my life, and we were just going to make arrangements to meet again when somebody she knew had the bad taste to get in at the last station but one. "" My continued silence did not appear to please Bloch. ""I was hoping,"" he said, ""thanks to you, to learn her address, so as to go there several times a week to taste in her arms the delights of Eros, dear to the gods; but I do not insist since you seem pledged to discretion with respect to a professional who gave herself to me three times running, and in the most refined manner, between Paris and the Point–du–Jour. I am bound to see her again, some night.""","Mesdemoiselles Bloch and their brother blushed to the roots of their hair, a sign of how impressed they were, when their parent, to show that he knew how to behave like a king when occasion demanded it, gave the order to serve champagne, then let drop the news that, as a ‘treat’ for his son’s ‘faithful friends’, he had booked three seats for the performance to be given at the Casino that very night by a touring comic-opera company. He was sorry he could not get a box, but they were all taken: however, he had often tried every one of them, and you were far better off in the front stalls. Whereas the son’s failing, that is, a way of behaving he thought was invisible to others, was bad manners, the father’s fault was avarice. So he had the ‘champagne’, really a mediocre sparkling wine, poured from a carafe, and he treated us to ‘front stalls’ which turned out to be seats in the back stalls, half the price of the others, under the miraculous persuasion of his failing that no one would notice the difference, whether at dinner or in the theatre (where all the boxes were in fact unoccupied). M. Bloch having let us wet our lips in shallow champagne glasses, which his son described as ‘craters with deep-swept flanks’, he invited us to admire a painting which he liked so much that it had accompanied him to Balbec. It was a Rubens, he told us. Saint-Loup was naïve enough to ask whether it was signed. M. Bloch replied with a blush that he had had the signature cut off because of the frame, but this was of no importance as he had no intention of selling it. Then he bundled us out, so as to catch up on his reading of the Journal officiel,78 piles of which were to be seen about the house, and which he said he could not avoid reading, because of his ‘parliamentary situation’, on which he did not enlighten us further. ‘I’ll just get a scarf, said Bloch, as Zephyrus and Boreas are abroad on the fish-teeming seas, and if we delay even a little after the performance, our homecoming will be lit by the first glimmerings of rosy-fingered Eos. By the way,’ he said to Saint-Loup, once we had left the house (and I had my heart in my mouth, having immediately realized that Bloch’s irony was now being exercised at the expense of M. de Charlus), ‘who’s the priceless clown in the dark suit that you were parading about the beach the other day? – That was my uncle, Saint-Loup answered curtly. Such a blunder was not the sort of thing to give Bloch pause. He spluttered with laughter: ‘Congratulations! I ought to have realized – he’s very neatly turned out, and he’s got a physog that stamps him as a codger of the first water. – You are utterly and completely mistaken, Saint-Loup snapped. He is a man of high intelligence. – Well, that’s a pity, Bloch said, because it makes him less than perfect. I wouldn’t mind getting to know him, though, as I’m sure I could write something pretty good on customers like him. When you see him walk past, it’s just huge! Mind you, I would have to underplay the face with its burlesque aspect, caricature being beneath any artist who’s really interested in the plastic beauty of his sentences – though mind you it did give me a good laugh! – and I’d bring out your uncle’s aristocratic side, which really makes a splendiferous effect, and once you get over the first fit of the giggles it really does strike you with its grand manner. Tell me, Bloch said to me, just to change the subject for a moment, there’s one thing I keep meaning to ask you, then every time we meet, some divinity, some blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to find out from you something which could come in handy some day – which might already have come in handy! Who is that beautiful creature I saw you with once at the Zoo? She was with a gent that I know by sight and a damsel with long hair.’ I had of course noticed at the time that the name of Bloch was unfamiliar to Mme Swann, who had called him by some other name and said he was attached to a ministry, a statement which I had never thought to ask him to verify. I could not understand how Bloch, who, according to what she had said, had sought an introduction to her, could remain in ignorance of her name. This so surprised me that I was speechless for a moment. ‘ Well, anyway, he said, you deserve to be congratulated – she must have given you a nice time. I had just met her a few days before, you see, riding on the suburban line. She had no objection to yours truly, and so a nice ride was had by one and all, and we were just on the point of arranging to do it again on a future occasion when someone she knew had the bad form to get on, just one stop before the terminus.’ I said nothing, which did not appear much to his liking. ‘ So, he said, I was rather hoping you could let me have her address, and then I could pop round there a few times a week and share with her the joys of Eros, favourite of the gods. But look, if you’re reluctant to let me into the secrets of a professional who, between central Paris and the Point-du-Jour, had no reluctance to letting me into her, three times in a row and with refinements, then so be it, I won’t insist. I’m bound to come across her again, one of these evenings.’"
"Elle avait de tous ces grands hommes des autographes, et semblait, se prévalant des relations particulières que sa famille avait eues avec eux, penser que son jugement à leur égard était plus juste que celui de jeunes gens qui comme moi n’avaient pas pu les fréquenter.","She had autographs of all these great men, and seemed, taking advantage of the special relations her family had had with them, to think that her judgment of them was fairer than that of young people like me who had not been able to frequent.",""" She possessed the autographs of all these great men, and seemed, when she put forward the personal relations which her family had had with them, to assume that her judgment of them must be better founded than that of young people who, like myself, had had no opportunity of meeting them.","She possessed pieces in the handwriting of every one of these great men; and she appeared to believe, on the strength of the personal acquaintance her family had enjoyed with them, that her judgment of their value was more accurate than that of people who, like myself, were too young to have known them."
"Il fallait songer au retour. Mme de Villeparisis qui avait un certain sens de la nature, plus froid que celui de ma grand’mère, mais qui sait reconnaître, même en dehors des musées et des demeures aristocratiques, la beauté simple et majestueuse de certaines choses anciennes, disait au cocher de prendre la vieille route de Balbec, peu fréquentée, mais plantée de vieux ormes qui nous semblaient admirables.","We had to think about returning. Madame de Villeparisis, who had a certain sense of nature, colder than that of my grandmother, but who knows how to recognize, even outside museums and aristocratic residences, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old things, said to the coachman to take the old road to Balbec, little used, but planted with old elms which seemed to us admirable.","It was time to be thinking of home. Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, colder than that of my grandmother but capable of recognising, even outside museums and noblemen's houses, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old and venerable things, told her coachman to take us back by the old Balbec road, a road little used but planted with old elm–trees which we thought quite admirable.","It was time to think of turning for home. Mme de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, albeit one which was less warm than my grandmother’s, and whose capacity for the appreciation of simple grandiose beauty in certain ancient things was not limited to the contents of museums and the houses of the aristocracy, told the coachman to return to Balbec by the back road, which was lined with old elm trees that we thought very fine, and where one rarely saw anyone."

"M. Bloch père qui ne connaissait Bergotte que de loin, et la vie de Bergotte que par les racontars du parterre, avait une manière tout aussi indirecte de prendre connaissance de ses œuvres, à l’aide de jugements d’apparence littéraire. Il vivait dans le monde des à peu près, où l’on salue dans le vide, où l’on juge dans le faux. L’inexactitude, l’incompétence, n’y diminuent pas l’assurance, au contraire. C’est le miracle bienfaisant de l’amour-propre que peu de gens pouvant avoir les relations brillantes et les connaissances profondes, ceux auxquels elles font défaut se croient encore les mieux partagés parce que l’optique des gradins sociaux fait que tout rang semble le meilleur à celui qui l’occupe et qui voit moins favorisés que lui, mal lotis, à plaindre, les plus grands qu’il nomme et calomnie sans les connaître, juge et dédaigne sans les comprendre. Même dans les cas où la multiplication des faibles avantages personnels par l’amour-propre ne suffirait pas à assurer à chacun la dose de bonheur, supérieure à celle accordée aux autres, qui lui est nécessaire, l’envie est là pour combler la différence. Il est vrai que si l’envie s’exprime en phrases dédaigneuses, il faut traduire : « Je ne veux pas le connaître » par « je ne peux pas le connaître ». C’est le sens intellectuel. Mais le sens passionné est bien : « Je ne veux pas le connaître. » On sait que cela n’est pas vrai mais on ne le dit pas cependant par simple artifice, on le dit parce qu’on éprouve ainsi, et cela suffit pour supprimer la distance, c’est-à-dire pour le bonheur.","M. Bloch senior, who only knew Bergotte from afar, and Bergotte's life only through the gossip of the audience, had an equally indirect way of becoming acquainted with his works, with the help of seemingly literary judgments. He lived in the world of approximations, where one salutes in the void, where one judges in the false. Inaccuracy, incompetence, do not diminish the assurance, on the contrary. It is the benevolent miracle of self-love that few people who can have brilliant relationships and deep acquaintances, those who lack them still believe themselves the best shared because the perspective of the social tiers makes all rank seem the best to him who occupies it and who sees less favored than him, badly off, to be pitied, the greatest whom he names and slanders without knowing them, judges and disdains without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of small personal advantages by self-esteem would not be enough to ensure everyone the dose of happiness, superior to that granted to others, which is necessary for him, envy is there to make up the difference. . It is true that if envy is expressed in disdainful phrases, it is necessary to translate: “I do not want to know him” by “I cannot know him”. It is the intellectual sense. But the passionate meaning is indeed: ""I don't want to know him."" We know that this is not true, but we do not say it however by simple artifice, we say it because we experience this way, and that is enough to eliminate the distance, that is to say for happiness.","M. Bloch senior, who knew Bergotte only by sight, and Bergotte's life only from what was common gossip, had a manner quite as indirect of making the acquaintance of his books, by the help of criticisms that were apparently literary. He lived in the world of ""very nearlies,"" where people salute the empty air and arrive at wrong judgments. Inexactitude, incompetence do not modify their assurance; quite the contrary. It is the propitious miracle of self–esteem that, since few of us are in a position to enjoy the society of distinguished people, or to form intellectual friendships, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it, and beholds as less favoured than himself, less fortunate and therefore to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing, judges and—despises without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of his modest personal advantages by his self–esteem would not suffice to assure a man the dose of happiness, superior to that accorded to others, which is essential to him, envy is always there to make up the balance. It is true that if envy finds expression in scornful phrases, we must translate 'I have no wish to know him' by ' I have no means of knowing him.' That is the intellectual sense. But the emotional sense is indeed, 'I have no wish to know him.' The speaker knows that it is not true, but he does not, all the same, say it simply to deceive; he says it because it is what he feels, and that is sufficient to bridge the gulf between them, that is to say to make him happy.","M. Bloch senior, who had no acquaintance with Bergotte, but had heard something of his life by lending an ear to gossip in theatres, had an equally indirect way of being familiar with his books, relying on judgments of apparent literary relevance. His world was that of approximations, where greetings are half-exchanged, where half-truths usurp the place of judgment. Inaccuracies and incompetence in no way reduce self-assurance. The opposite is more usual: self-esteem works its beneficent miracle and, since few of us can enjoy intimacy with the great or a familiarity with higher learning, those who are excluded from these can still see their own position as the most enviable; the point of view we have from the social tier we occupy makes each of us believe it is the best, for we can see not only many who are worse off than ourselves and to be pitied, but also the great, whom we can name and condemn without knowing them, misjudge and disdain without understanding them. Those who believe they deserve a share of happiness greater than that accorded to others, who find deficient the degree of it afforded them even by self-esteem’s magnification of their meagre personal advantages, can call upon envy to make up the deficit. Envy may well express itself, of course, in the accents of disdain; and ‘I have no wish to know him’ must be translated as ‘I have no possibility of knowing him’. The latter is the literal translation; but the passionate meaning remains: ‘I have no wish to know him.’ We know it is untrue; yet it is not simple dishonesty that makes us say it: we say it because that is how we feel, and that is enough to abolish the difference between truth and untruth, enough for our happiness."
– Ah !… Il a dit qu’il te trouvait intelligent ? dit ma mère. Cela me fait plaisir parce que c’est un homme de talent ?,"""Ah!... He said he thought you were intelligent?"" said my mother. That makes me happy because he is a talented man?","""Oh! He said that he found you intelligent,"" repeated my mother. ""I am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.""","‘Really? my mother said. He said you were intelligent? Well, that’s good to hear, from such a talented man."
"Pendant tout ce retour, l’image d’Albertine noyée dans la lumière qui émanait des autres jeunes filles ne fut pas seule à exister pour moi. Mais comme la lune, qui n’est qu’un petit nuage blanc d’une forme plus caractérisée et plus fixe pendant le jour, prend toute sa puissance dès que celui-ci s’est éteint, ainsi quand je fus rentré à l’hôtel ce fut la seule image d’Albertine qui s’éleva de mon cœur et se mit à briller. Ma chambre me semblait tout d’un coup nouvelle. Certes, il y avait bien longtemps qu’elle n’était plus la chambre ennemie du premier soir. Nous modifions inlassablement notre demeure autour de nous ; et, au fur et à mesure que l’habitude nous dispense de sentir, nous supprimons les éléments nocifs de couleur, de dimension et d’odeur qui objectivaient notre malaise. Ce n’était plus davantage la chambre, assez puissante encore sur ma sensibilité, non certes pour me faire souffrir, mais pour me donner de la joie, la cuve des beaux jours, semblable à une piscine à mi-hauteur de laquelle ils faisaient miroiter un azur mouillé de lumière, que recouvrait un moment, impalpable et blanche comme une émanation de la chaleur, une voile reflétée et fuyante ; ni la chambre purement esthétique des soirs picturaux ; c’était la chambre où j’étais depuis tant de jours que je ne la voyais plus. Or voici que je venais de recommencer à ouvrir les yeux sur elle, mais cette fois-ci de ce point de vue égoïste qui est celui de l’amour. Je songeais que la belle glace oblique, les élégantes bibliothèques vitrées donneraient à Albertine si elle venait me voir une bonne idée de moi. À la place d’un lieu de transition où je passais un instant avant de m’évader vers la plage ou vers Rivebelle, ma chambre me redevenait réelle et chère, se renouvelait, car j’en regardais et en appréciais chaque meuble avec les yeux d’Albertine.","Throughout this return, the image of Albertine drowned in the light emanating from the other young girls was not the only one to exist for me. But as the moon, which is only a small white cloud of a more characteristic and fixed form during the day, assumes all its power as soon as the latter has died out, so when I returned to the hotel it was the only image of Albertine that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room suddenly seemed new to me. Admittedly, it had long since ceased to be the enemy room of the first evening. We tirelessly modify our home around us; and as habit relieves us of feeling, we remove the noxious elements of color, size, and smell that objectified our discomfort. It was no longer the bedroom, still powerful enough on my sensibility, certainly not to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the tub for fine weather, like a swimming pool halfway up which they shimmered an azure wet with light, covered for a moment, impalpable and white as an emanation of heat, by a reflected and fleeting sail; nor the purely aesthetic bedroom of pictorial evenings; it was the room where I had been for so many days that I no longer saw her. But now I had just started to open my eyes to her again, but this time from this selfish point of view which is that of love. I thought that the beautiful slanting mirror, the elegant glazed bookcases would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good idea of me. Instead of a place of transition where I spent a moment before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me again, renewed itself, because I looked at and appreciated each piece of furniture with my eyes. of Albertine.","As we walked home the image of Albertine, bathed in the light that streamed from the other girls, was not the only one that existed for me. But as the moon, which is no more than a tiny white cloud of a more definite and fixed shape than other clouds during the day, assumes her full power as soon as daylight dies, so when I was once more in the hotel it was Albertine's sole image that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room seemed to me to have become suddenly a new place. Of course, for a long time past, it had not been the hostile room of my first night in it. All our lives we go on patiently modifying the surroundings in which we dwell; and gradually, as habit dispenses us from feeling them, we suppress the noxious elements of colour, shape and smell which were at the root of our discomfort. Nor was it any longer the room, still potent enough over my sensibility, not certainly to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the fount of summer days, like a marble basin in which, half way up its polished sides, they mirrored an azure surface steeped in light over which glided for an instant, impalpable and white as a wave of heat, a shadowy and fleeting cloud; not the room, wholly aesthetic, of the pictorial evening hours; it was the room in which I had been now for so many days that I no longer saw it. And now I was just beginning again to open my eyes to it, but this time from the selfish angle which is that of love. I liked to feel that the fine big mirror across one corner, the handsome bookcases with their fronts of glass would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good impression of myself. Instead of a place of transit in which I would stay for a few minutes before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me, fashioned itself anew, for I looked at and appreciated each article of its furniture with the eyes of Albertine.","All the way back to Balbec, the image of Albertine, flooded by the glow from the other girls, was not the only one I could see. But just as the moon, after spending the daylight hours in the guise of a white cloudlet, more shaped and stable than others, begins to come into its own as soon as daylight fades, so by the time I was back in the hotel, it was Albertine’s image which rose to shine unrivalled above the horizon of my heart. My room suddenly seemed new to me. It had, of course, long since ceased to be the baleful bedroom it had been on my first night. We are tireless redesigners of the space we live in: gradually, as habit relieves us of the need to experience, we eliminate the pernicious elements of colour, dimension and smell which objectified our unease. By now, it was no longer even the room which retained power enough over my sensitivity, not to make me suffer, but to give me joy; it was not the reservoir of sunny days, like a swimming-bath half-way up the sides of which they dappled their azure, watery with light briefly blanked out by the fleeting reflection of a sail, as white and impalpable as a flash of heat; nor was it the purely aesthetic bedroom of the evening picture-displays; it was merely the room I had lived in for so many days that I had stopped seeing it. But now my eyes had just begun to open to it again, seeing it from the selfish viewpoint which is that of love. I fancied that, if Albertine should ever visit me here, the fine slanting cheval-glass and the handsome glass-fronted book-cases would give her a high opinion of me. Instead of being a mere place of transit, where I spent a moment or two before making my escape to the beach or over to Rivebelle, my room had once more become real and dear to me, had been renewed, because I could see and appreciate all its contents through the eyes of Albertine."
"Quand Mme de Villeparisis rencontrait Françoise au moment (que celle-ci appelait « le midi ») où, coiffée d’un beau bonnet et entourée de la considération générale, elle descendait « manger aux courriers », Mme de Villeparisis l’arrêtait pour lui demander de nos nouvelles. Et Françoise, nous transmettant les commissions de la marquise : « Elle a dit : Vous leur donnerez bien le bonjour, contrefaisait la voix de Mme de Villeparisis de laquelle elle croyait citer textuellement les paroles, tout en ne les déformant pas moins que Platon celles de Socrate ou saint Jean celles de Jésus. Françoise était naturellement très touchée de ces attentions. Tout au plus ne croyait-elle pas ma grand’mère et pensait-elle que celle-ci mentait dans un intérêt de classe, les gens riches se soutenant les uns les autres, quand elle assurait que Mme de Villeparisis avait été autrefois ravissante. Il est vrai qu’il n’en subsistait que de bien faibles restes dont on n’eût pu, à moins d’être plus artiste que Françoise, restituer la beauté détruite. Car pour comprendre combien une vieille femme a pu être jolie, il ne faut pas seulement regarder, mais traduire chaque trait.","When Madame de Villeparisis met Françoise at the time (which she called ""le midi"") when, wearing a beautiful bonnet and surrounded by general consideration, she was going down to ""eat at the couriers"", Madame de Villeparisis would stop him for him. ask about us. And Françoise, passing on to us the Marquise's orders: ""She said: You will give them good morning,"" counterfeited the voice of Madame de Villeparisis, whose words she thought she was quoting verbatim, while distorting them no less than Plato did those of Socrates or Saint John those of Jesus. Françoise was naturally very touched by these attentions. At most she did not believe my grandmother and thought that she was lying in a class interest, rich people supporting each other, when she asserted that Madame de Villeparisis had once been ravishing. It is true that there remained only very weak remnants of which one could not, unless one was more artistic than Françoise, restore the destroyed beauty. Because to understand how pretty an old woman could have been, one must not only look, but translate each feature.","Were she to encounter Françoise at the moment (which Françoise called 'the noon') when, wearing her fine cap and surrounded with every mark of respect, she was coming downstairs to 'feed with the service,' Mme. Villeparisis would stop her to ask after us. And Françoise, when transmitting to us the Marquise's message: ""She said to me, 'You'll be sure and bid them good day,' she said,"" counterfeited the voice of Mme. de Villeparisis, whose exact words she imagined herself to be quoting textually, whereas she was really corrupting them no less than Plato corrupts the words of Socrates or Saint John the words of Jesus. Françoise, as was natural, was deeply touched by these attentions. Only she did not believe my grandmother, but supposed that she must be lying in the interest of her class (the rich always combining thus to support one another) when she assured us that Mme. de Villeparisis had been lovely as a young woman. It was true that of this loveliness only the faintest trace remained, from which no one—unless he happened to be a great deal more of an artist than Françoise—would have been able to restore her ruined beauty. For in order to understand how beautiful an elderly woman can once have been one must not only study but interpret every line of her face.","If Mme de Villeparisis happened to meet Françoise when the latter was going down (at ‘twelve o’clock time’ in Françoise’s parlance), wearing her neat cap and amid universal esteem, to lunch in the guests’ servants’ quarters, she would pause with her on the stairs and ask after us. When Françoise told us about it later, she would say, with an attempt to imitate Mme de Villeparisis ’s voice, ‘ And she said to me: “And be sure to not forget to tell them I was asking after them,” she said.’ Françoise was clearly convinced that she was faithfully reproducing the very words uttered by Mme de Villeparisis, though she distorted them no less than Plato distorted those of Socrates, or St John those of Christ. She was naturally very impressed by the interest which Mme de Villeparisis took in her. Not that she believed my grandmother, who she knew was lying out of class solidarity (these rich, always sticking together!) , when she said Mme de Villeparisis had once been a great beauty. It was true there were very few vestiges left of this beauty; and to reconstruct from them the glory that was gone, Françoise would have had to be more of an artist than she was. To see how pretty an old woman once was, it is not enough just to look at each feature; they must be translated."
"Le plus grand nombre de ceux qui m’entouraient n’étaient pas ce que j’aurais le plus aimé à voir de lui, les peintures appartenant à ses première et deuxième manières, comme disait une revue d’art anglaise qui traînait sur la table du salon du Grand-Hôtel, la manière mythologique et celle où il avait subi l’influence du Japon, toutes deux admirablement représentées, disait-on, dans la collection de Mme de Guermantes. Naturellement, ce qu’il avait dans son atelier, ce n’était guère que des marines prises ici, à Balbec. Mais j’y pouvais discerner que le charme de chacune consistait en une sorte de métamorphose des choses représentées, analogue à celle qu’en poésie on nomme métaphore, et que si Dieu le Père avait créé les choses en les nommant, c’est en leur ôtant leur nom, ou en leur en donnant un autre qu’Elstir les recréait. Les noms qui désignent les choses répondent toujours à une notion de l’intelligence, étrangère à nos impressions véritables, et qui nous force à éliminer d’elles tout ce qui ne se rapporte pas à cette notion.","Most of those around me weren't what I would have liked most to see of him, the paintings belonging to his first and second manners, as an English art journal lying on the table said. from the salon of the Grand Hotel, the mythological manner and that in which he had been influenced by Japan, both admirably represented, it was said, in the collection of Madame de Guermantes. Naturally, what he had in his studio was little more than seascapes taken here, at Balbec. But I could discern there that the charm of each consisted in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented, analogous to that which in poetry is called metaphor, and that if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by stripping them of their name, or giving them another one that Elstir recreated. The names which designate things always correspond to a notion of intelligence, foreign to our true impressions, and which forces us to eliminate from them everything that does not relate to this notion.","Most of those that covered the walls were not what I should chiefly have liked to see of his work, paintings in what an English art journal which lay about on the reading–room table in the Grand Hotel called his first and second manners, the mythological manner and the manner in which he shewed signs of Japanese influence, both admirably exemplified, the article said, in the collection of Mme. de Guermantes. Naturally enough, what he had in his studio were almost all seascapes done here, at Balbec. But I was able to discern from these that the charm of each of them lay in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented in it, analogous to what in poetry we call metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created them anew. The names which denote things correspond invariably to an intellectual notion, alien to our true impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that is not in keeping with itself.","Most of those in the studio were not what I would have preferred to see: the paintings from his first and second periods, so called by an English art magazine which I had found lying on the table in the salon at the Grand-Hôtel, that is, his mythological manner and the paintings in which a Japanese influence had become evident, both of which were admirably represented, the article said, in the collection of Mme de Guermantes. Almost all of the works I could see about me in the studio were, of course, sea-scapes done recently here in Balbec. But I could see that their charm lay in a kind of metamorphosis of the things depicted, analogous to the poetical device known as metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, Elstir recreated them by removing their names, or by giving them another name. The names of things always express a view of the mind, which is foreign to our genuine impressions of them, and which forces us to eliminate from them whatever does not correspond to that view."

"Environ un mois après le jour où nous avions joué au furet, on me dit qu’Albertine devait partir le lendemain matin pour aller passer quarante-huit heures chez Mme Bontemps, et qu’obligée de prendre le train de bonne heure, elle viendrait coucher la veille au Grand-Hôtel, d’où avec l’omnibus elle pourrait, sans déranger les amies chez qui elle habitait, prendre le premier train. J’en parlai à Andrée. « Je ne le crois pas du tout, me répondit Andrée d’un air mécontent. D’ailleurs cela ne vous avancerait à rien, car je suis bien certaine qu’Albertine ne voudra pas vous voir, si elle vient seule à l’hôtel. Ce ne serait pas protocolaire, ajouta-t-elle en usant d’un adjectif qu’elle aimait beaucoup, depuis peu, dans le sens de « ce qui se fait ». Je vous dis cela parce que je connais les idées d’Albertine. Moi, qu’est-ce que vous voulez que cela me fasse que vous la voyiez ou non ? Cela m’est bien égal. »","About a month after the day we played ferret, I was told that Albertine was to leave the next morning to spend forty-eight hours with Madame Bontemps, and that, having to take the train early, she would come to bed. the day before at the Grand Hotel, from where, with the omnibus, she could, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, catch the first train. I spoke to Andrée about it. ""I don't believe it at all,"" replied Andrée with an air of displeasure. Besides, it wouldn't do you any good, for I'm sure Albertine won't want to see you if she comes alone to the hotel. It wouldn't be formal, she added, using an adjective she had come to love recently, in the sense of ""what's being done."" I tell you this because I know Albertine's ideas. Me, what does it matter to me whether you see her or not? It doesn't matter to me. »","About a month after the day on which we had played 'ferret' together, I learned that Albertine was going away next morning to spend a couple of days with Mme. Bontemps, and, since she would have to start early, was coming to sleep that night at the Grand Hotel, from which, by taking the omnibus, she would be able, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, to catch the first train in the morning. I mentioned this to Andrée. ""I don't believe a word of it,"" she replied, with a look of annoyance. "" Anyhow it won't help you at all, for I'm quite sure Albertine won't want to see you if she goes to the hotel by herself. It wouldn't be 'regulation,'"" she added, employing an epithet which had recently come into favour with her, in the sense of 'what is done.' ""I tell you this because I understand Albertine. What difference do you suppose it makes to me, whether you see her or not? Not the slightest, I can assure you!""","About a month after the day when we played ring-on-a-string, I heard that Albertine was leaving the following morning, to go and spend two days at Mme Bontemps’s, and that, because she was taking an early train, she would be spending the night at the Grand-Hôtel, so as to be able to take the bus to the station and catch the first train without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying. I spoke to Andrée about it. ‘ No, I don’t think so, she said, looking discontented. Anyway, it would get you nowhere, because I’m pretty sure Albertine won’t want to see you if she’s spending the night alone at the hotel. It wouldn’t be protocol.’ (This was an expression Andrée had been using freely for some time, with the sense of ‘It’s not the done thing’.) ‘I’m only telling you this because I know how Albertine’s mind works. I mean, for all I care, you can see her as much as you like. It’s all one to me.’"
"– Et mon mari m’a dit, Monsieur, que vous l’entraîneriez peut-être un de ces étés en Espagne, j’en suis ravie pour lui.","“And my husband told me, sir, that you might take him one of these summers to Spain, I’m delighted for him.","""My husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.""","And when that happens, we’ll see a fine how-d’ye-do! – My husband tells me, Monsieur, that you’re thinking of taking him off to Spain with you one of these summers. I’m sure he would enjoy that."
"Et moi aussi, il fallait que je rentrasse, avant d’avoir goûté à ces plaisirs de l’hiver, desquels les chrysanthèmes m’avaient semblé être l’enveloppe éclatante. Ces plaisirs n’étaient pas venus et cependant Mme Swann n’avait pas l’air d’attendre encore quelque chose. Elle laissait les domestiques emporter le thé comme elle aurait annoncé : « On ferme ! » Et elle finissait par me dire : « Alors, vraiment, vous partez ? Hé bien, good bye ! » Je sentais que j’aurais pu rester sans rencontrer ces plaisirs inconnus, et que ma tristesse n’était pas seule à m’avoir privé d’eux. Ne se trouvaient-ils donc pas situés sur cette route battue des heures, qui mènent toujours si vite à l’instant du départ, mais plutôt sur quelque chemin de traverse inconnu de moi et par où il eût fallu bifurquer ? Du moins le but de ma visite était atteint, Gilberte saurait que j’étais venu chez ses parents quand elle n’était pas là, et que j’y avais, comme n’avait cessé de le répéter Mme Cottard, fait d’emblée, de prime abord, la conquête de Mme Verdurin. « Il faut, m’avait dit la femme du docteur qui ne l’avait jamais vue faire « autant de frais », que vous ayez ensemble des atomes crochus. » Gilberte saurait que j’avais parlé d’elle comme je devais le faire, avec tendresse, mais que je n’avais pas cette incapacité de vivre sans que nous nous vissions que je croyais à la base de l’ennui qu’elle avait éprouvé ces derniers temps auprès de moi. J’avais dit à Mme Swann que je ne pouvais plus me trouver avec Gilberte. Je l’avais dit comme si j’avais décidé pour toujours de ne plus la voir. Et la lettre que j’allais envoyer à Gilberte serait conçue dans le même sens. Seulement à moi-même pour me donner courage je ne me proposais qu’un suprême et court effort de peu de jours. Je me disais : « C’est le dernier rendez-vous d’elle que je refuse, j’accepterai le prochain. » Pour me rendre la séparation moins difficile à réaliser, je ne me la présentais pas comme définitive. Mais je sentais bien qu’elle le serait.","And I, too, had to go home, before I had tasted those pleasures of winter, of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the dazzling envelope. These pleasures had not come and yet Madame Swann did not seem to be expecting anything yet. She let the servants take away the tea as she would have announced: ""We're closing!"" And she ended up saying to me: ""So, are you really leaving?"" Well, good bye! I felt that I could have gone on without encountering these unknown pleasures, and that my sadness was not alone in having deprived me of them. Weren't they then located on this road beaten for hours, which always leads so quickly at the moment of departure, but rather on some crossroad unknown to me and by which it would have been necessary to branch off? At least the purpose of my visit had been achieved, Gilberte would know that I had come to her parents' house when she was not there, and that I had, as Madame Cottard had never ceased to repeat, , at first sight, the conquest of Mme Verdurin. ""The doctor's wife had told me, who had never seen her put up with 'so much expense', that you have to have a good chemistry together. Gilberte would know that I had spoken of her as I should, with tenderness, but that I didn't have this inability to live without us seeing each other that I believed was the reason for the boredom she had. experienced lately with me. I had told Madame Swann that I could no longer be with Gilberte. I said it as if I had decided forever not to see her again. And the letter I was going to send to Gilberte would be conceived along the same lines. Only to myself, to give me courage, I only proposed to myself a supreme and short effort of a few days. I said to myself: “This is the last appointment with her that I refuse, I will accept the next one. To make the separation less difficult for me to achieve, I did not present it to myself as definitive. But I knew she would be.","And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she expected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea–things, as who should say ""Time, please, gentlemen!"" And at last she did say to me: ""Really, must you go? Very well; good–bye!"" I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross–road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, ""made a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,"" whom, she added, she had never seen 'make so much' of anyone. (""You and she must have hooked atoms."") She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: ""This is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the next invitation."" To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be.","I had to go home too, though I had not savoured those promised winter pleasures that had seemed to lie concealed within the brilliant surface of the chrysanthemums. The pleasures had not materialized; yet Mme Swann seemed to be expecting nothing further. She let the servants carry away the tea things, as she might have announced, ‘Time, please!’ She even said to me, ‘Really, must you go?’ Then she added in English, ‘Well, good-bye!’ I sensed that, even if I were to stay on, I would never find those secret pleasures, and that it was not only my sorrow that had withheld them from me. Was it possible they did not lie somewhere along the well-frequented path of those hours which always lead so soon to going-home time, but by some side-path, branching off somewhere else unknown to me, which I should have taken? At least I had achieved the aim of my visit: Gilberte would know I had been to her house during her absence, where, as Mme Cottard kept saying, I had ‘Straight off, from the word go, completely won over Mme Verdurin!’, whom she had never seen ‘go to so much trouble’. She had added, ‘I expect it’s a case of like attracting like.’ Gilberte would be told I had spoken about her affectionately, as I could not help doing; and she would know I did not suffer from the inability to live without her which I felt was the source of her recent discontents with me. I had told Mme Swann I could no longer see Gilberte. I had made it sound as though my decision to sever contact with her was irrevocable. The letter I was going to send Gilberte would also be couched in those terms. But to keep my courage up, I told myself I would make the heroic but brief effort of staying away from her for only a few days longer: ‘This will be the very last invitation of hers that I decline! I’ll accept the next one!’ So as to make my separation from her easier to achieve, I tried to see it as not being definitive. I sensed, however, that it was going to be."

"J’avais peur que ce ton, cette manière d’inviter quelqu’un en lui conseillant de ne pas venir, n’eût froissé Bloch, et je trouvais que Saint-Loup eût mieux fait de ne rien dire. Mais je m’étais trompé, car après le départ du train, tant que nous fîmes route ensemble jusqu’au croisement de deux avenues où il fallait nous séparer, l’une allant à l’hôtel, l’autre à la villa de Bloch, celui-ci ne cessa de me demander quel jour nous irions à Doncières, car après « toutes les amabilités que Saint-Loup lui avait faites », il eût été « trop grossier de sa part » de ne pas se rendre à son invitation. J’étais content qu’il n’eût pas remarqué, ou fût assez peu mécontent pour désirer feindre de ne pas avoir remarqué, sur quel ton moins que pressant, à peine poli, l’invitation avait été faite. J’aurais pourtant voulu pour Bloch qu’il s’évitât le ridicule d’aller tout de suite à Doncières. Mais je n’osais pas lui donner un conseil qui n’eût pu que lui déplaire en lui montrant que Saint-Loup avait été moins pressant que lui n’était empressé. Il l’était beaucoup trop, et bien que tous les défauts qu’il avait dans ce genre fussent compensés chez lui par de remarquables qualités que d’autres plus réservés n’auraient pas eues, il poussait l’indiscrétion à un point dont on était agacé. La semaine ne pouvait, à l’entendre, se passer sans que nous allions à Doncières (il disait « nous », car je crois qu’il comptait un peu sur ma présence pour excuser la sienne). Tout le long de la route, devant le gymnase perdu dans ses arbres, devant le terrain de tennis, devant la maison, devant le marchand de coquillages, il m’arrêta, me suppliant de fixer un jour, et comme je ne le fis pas, me quitta fâché en me disant : « À ton aise, messire. Moi en tous cas, je suis obligé d’y aller puisqu’il m’a invité. »","I was afraid that this tone, this manner of inviting someone and advising him not to come, would have offended Bloch, and I thought that Saint-Loup would have done better not to say anything. But I was wrong, because after the train left, as long as we traveled together until the intersection of two avenues where we had to separate, one going to the hotel, the other to the villa of Bloch , he kept asking me what day we would go to Doncières, because after ""all the kindnesses that Saint-Loup had given him"", it would have been ""too rude of him"" not to accept his invitation. I was glad he hadn't noticed, or was undispleased enough to want to pretend not to have noticed, in what less than urgent, barely polite tone the invitation had been made. However, I would have liked for Bloch to avoid the ridicule of going immediately to Doncières. But I dared not give him advice which could only have displeased him by showing him that Saint-Loup had been less insistent than he was eager. He was too much so, and although all the faults he had in this way were compensated for in him by remarkable qualities which others more reserved would not have had, he pushed his indiscretion to a point which one was annoyed. The week could not, according to him, pass without us going to Doncières (he said ""we"", because I think he was counting a little on my presence to excuse his). All along the road, in front of the gymnasium lost in its trees, in front of the tennis court, in front of the house, in front of the shellfish merchant, he stopped me, begging me to fix a day, and since I did not , left me angry, saying to me: ""As you are at ease, sir. Me in any case, I have to go since he invited me. »","I was afraid that this tone, this way of inviting a person while warning him not to come, might have wounded Bloch, and felt that Saint–Loup would have done better, saying nothing. But I was mistaken, for after the train had gone, while we were walking back together as far as the crossroads at which we should have to part, one road going to the hotel, the other to the Blochs' villa, he never ceased from asking me on what day we should go to Doncières, for after ""all the civilities that Saint–Loup had shewn"" him, it would be 'too unmannerly' on his part not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had not noticed, or was so little displeased as to wish to let it be thought that he had not noticed on how far from pressing, how barely polite a note the invitation had been sounded. At the same time I should have liked Bloch, for his own sake, to refrain from making a fool of himself by going over at once to Doncières. But I dared not offer a piece of advice which could only have offended him by hinting that Saint–Loup had been less pressing than himself impressed. He was a great deal too ready to respond, and even if all his faults of this nature were atoned for by remarkable qualities which others, with more reserve than he, would not possess, he carried indiscretion to a pitch that was almost maddening. The week must not, to hear him speak, pass without our going to Doncières (he said 'our' for I think that he counted to some extent on my presence there as an excuse for his own). All the way home, opposite the gymnasium, in its grove of trees, opposite the lawn–tennis courts, the mayor's office, the shell–fish stall, he stopped me, imploring me to fix a day, and, as I did not, left me in a towering rage, saying: ""As your lordship pleases. For my part, I'm obliged to go since he has invited me.""","I was afraid this tone, this way of inviting someone while implying that he should not come, would offend Bloch; and I thought Saint-Loup would have been better to say nothing. In this I was mistaken, for after the train had left, and as Bloch and I were walking together as far as the crossroads where our paths diverged, one of them leading towards the hotel, the other towards his villa, he kept asking which day we would go to Doncières, since in view of ‘all the overtures of Saint-Loup towards him’ it would be ‘too ill-mannered of him’ not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had either not noticed, or was unoffended enough to wish to appear not to have noticed, the less than eager tone, almost impolite, in which the invitation had been delivered. However, for his sake, I would have preferred him to avoid the ridicule of going over to Doncières straight away. I did not dare advise him on this, though, as I could only have done so in a way which would displease him, by revealing that Saint-Loup’s eagerness to invite had been much less than his own to accept. He was in fact over-eager; and though all his faults in that line were compensated by remarkable qualities, which someone less forward would not have had, he was so tactless that it was a constant annoyance. According to him, we must not let the week pass without visiting Doncières (he said ‘we’ because, I think, he was half-counting on my presence to excuse his). All the way along the road, in front of the gymnasium among its trees, by the tennis court, in front of the town hall, in front of the sea-shell vendor’s, he kept making me stop, begging me to settle on a day; and as I declined, he walked off in a huff, saying, ‘As it please Your Lordship, then. But I at least am obliged to go, since he did invite me.’"
"Une fois M. de Charlus parti, nous pûmes enfin, Robert et moi, aller dîner chez Bloch. Or je compris pendant cette petite fête que les histoires trop facilement trouvées drôles par notre camarade étaient des histoires de M. Bloch père, et que l’homme « tout à fait curieux » était toujours un de ses amis qu’il jugeait de cette façon. Il y a un certain nombre de gens qu’on admire dans son enfance, un père plus spirituel que le reste de la famille, un professeur qui bénéficie à nos yeux de la métaphysique qu’il nous révèle, un camarade plus avancé que nous (ce que Bloch avait été pour moi) qui méprise le Musset de l’Espoir en Dieu quand nous l’aimons encore, et quand nous en serons venus au père Leconte ou à Claudel ne s’extasiera plus que sur","Once M. de Charlus had left, Robert and I were finally able to go and dine with Bloch. However, I understood during this little party that the stories too easily found funny by our comrade were stories of Mr. Bloch senior, and that the ""completely curious"" man was always one of his friends whom he judged in this way. . There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our childhood, a father who is more spiritual than the rest of the family, a teacher who benefits in our eyes from the metaphysics he reveals to us, a friend who is more advanced than us ( what Bloch had been for me) who despises the Musset of Hope in God when we still love it, and when we have come to Father Leconte or Claudel will no longer go into ecstasies except on","M. de Charlus having gone, Robert and I were free at last to dine with Bloch. And I realised during this little party that the stories too readily admitted by our friend as funny were favourite stories of M. Bloch senior, and that the son's 'really remarkable person' was always one of his father's friends whom he had so classified. There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our boyhood, a father with better brains than the rest of the family, a teacher who acquires credit in our eyes from the philosophy he reveals to us, a schoolfellow more advanced than we are (which was what Bloch had been to me), who despises the Musset of the Espoir en Dieu when we still admire it, and when we have reached Leconte or Claudel will be in ecstasies only over:","M. de Charlus having departed, Robert and I were at last able to go to dinner at Bloch’s. I realized that evening that the anecdotes at which Bloch was inclined to laugh too heartily were stories he had heard from M. Bloch senior, and that the ‘somebody really interesting’ who figured in them was always one of the latter’s friends whom he described in those words. We can all recall certain people we admired as children, a father who was wittier than the rest of the family, a teacher whose mind we saw as better than it was because he revealed philosophy to us, a fellow-pupil more advanced than ourselves (as Bloch had been in relation to me), who despises the Musset of ‘L’Espoir en Dieu’ at a time when we still admire him, but who, by the time we have moved on to old Leconte de Lisle or Claudel, will still be full of enthusiasm for the Musset of:"
"– Mais oui, comme tu dis là. J’avais remarqué, c’est très fin. On voit qu’il a une profonde expérience de la vie.","- Yes, as you say. I noticed, it's very thin. We see that he has a deep experience of life.","""Yes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast experience of life.""","– Yes, that was it. I thought it was very clever when I heard it. Anyone can see he’s a man with a broad experience of life."
"Je sortis de l’ascenseur, mais au lieu d’aller vers ma chambre je m’engageai plus avant dans le couloir, car à cette heure-là le valet de chambre de l’étage, quoiqu’il craignît les courants d’air, avait ouvert la fenêtre du bout, laquelle regardait, au lieu de la mer, le côté de la colline et de la vallée, mais ne les laissait jamais voir, car ses vitres, d’un verre opaque, étaient le plus souvent fermées. Je m’arrêtai devant elle en une courte station et le temps de faire mes dévotions à la « vue » que pour une fois elle découvrait au delà de la colline à laquelle était adossé l’hôtel et qui ne contenait qu’une maison posée à quelque distance, mais à laquelle la perspective et la lumière du soir en lui conservant son volume donnait une ciselure précieuse et un écrin de velours, comme à une de ces architectures en miniature, petit temple ou petite chapelle d’orfèvrerie et d’émaux qui servent de reliquaires et qu’on n’expose qu’à de rares jours à la vénération des fidèles. Mais cet instant d’adoration avait déjà trop duré, car le valet de chambre qui tenait d’une main un trousseau de clefs et de l’autre me saluait en touchant sa calotte de sacristain, mais sans la soulever à cause de l’air pur et frais du soir, venait refermer comme ceux d’une châsse les deux battants de la croisée et dérobait à mon adoration le monument réduit et la relique d’or. J’entrai dans ma chambre.","I got out of the elevator, but instead of going to my room I went further down the hall, because at that hour the valet upstairs, although he was afraid of drafts , had opened the end window, which looked, instead of the sea, at the side of the hill and the valley, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, of opaque glass, were most often closed. I stopped in front of her in a short stop and the time to make my devotions to the ""view"" that for once she discovered beyond the hill on which the hotel leaned and which contained only a house posed at distance, but to which the perspective and the evening light, while preserving its volume, gave it a precious carving and a velvet case, like one of those miniature architectures, a small temple or a small chapel of goldsmithery and enamels which serve as reliquaries and are only exposed on rare days to the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet who held a bunch of keys in one hand and the other greeted me by touching his sacristan cap, but without lifting it because of the air. pure and cool of the evening, came to close like those of a reliquary the two casements of the casement and hid from my adoration the reduced monument and the golden relic. I entered my room.","I stepped out of the lift, but instead of going to my room I made my way farther along the corridor, for before my arrival the valet in charge of the landing, despite his horror of draughts, had opened the window at the end, which instead of looking out to the sea faced the hill and valley inland, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, which were made of clouded glass, were generally closed. I made a short 'station' in front of it, time enough just to pay my devotions to the view which for once it revealed over the hill against which the back of the hotel rested, a view that contained but a solitary house, planted in the middle distance, though the perspective and the evening light in which I saw it, while preserving its mass, gave it a sculptural beauty and a velvet background, as though to one of those architectural works in miniature, tiny temples or chapels wrought in gold and enamels, which serve as reliquaries and are exposed only on rare and solemn days for the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet, who carried in one hand a bunch of keys and with the other saluted me by touching his verger's skull–cap, though without raising it, on account of the pure, cool evening air, came and drew together, like those of a shrine, the two sides of the window, and so shut off the minute edifice, the glistening relic from my adoring gaze. I went into my room.","On leaving the lift, instead of going directly to my room, I walked further along the corridor, as at that time of day the duty-servant, despite his aversion to draughts, had opened the window at the far end of it, and this window, though it overlooked the hillside and the valley, instead of the sea, never let one see them, since its panes were of opaque glass and it was usually kept shut. I stood for a moment in front of it, long enough to make my devotions to the view which it had for once disclosed: this went beyond the hill against which the hotel backed, and contained a single house, set some distance away, but with its bulk preserved by the perspective and the evening light, which had worked delicately on it, embossing it and setting it within a velvet-lined casket, as though it were an example of miniaturized architecture, a tiny temple or chapel worked in gold and enamel, used as a reliquary and exposed only on rare occasions to the veneration of the faithful. But my moment of worship had gone on too long, and the duty-servant, holding a bunch of keys in one hand and touching the other to his sexton’s cap, rather than exposing himself to the cool evening air by raising it to me, came along to close the windows, like the little double doors of a monstrance, thus putting an end to my adoration of the golden relic of the miniature church. I went to my room:"
"– D’autant plus que Sa Majesté qui est assez coutumière du fait avait tenu à lui en faire la surprise. Cette surprise a été complète du reste pour tout le monde, à commencer par le Ministre des Affaires étrangères, qui, à ce qu’on m’a dit, ne l’a pas trouvée à son goût. À quelqu’un qui lui en parlait, il aurait répondu très nettement, assez haut pour être entendu des personnes voisines : « Je n’ai été ni consulté, ni prévenu », indiquant clairement par là qu’il déclinait toute responsabilité dans l’événement. Il faut avouer que celui-ci a fait un beau tapage et je n’oserais pas affirmer, ajouta-t-il avec un sourire malicieux, que tels de mes collègues pour qui la loi suprême semble être celle du moindre effort n’en ont pas été troublés dans leur quiétude. Quant à Vaugoubert, vous savez qu’il avait été fort attaqué pour sa politique de rapprochement avec la France, et il avait dû d’autant plus en souffrir, que c’est un sensible, un cœur exquis. J’en puis d’autant mieux témoigner que, bien qu’il soit mon cadet et de beaucoup, je l’ai fort pratiqué, nous sommes amis de longue date, et je le connais bien. D’ailleurs qui ne le connaîtrait ? C’est une âme de cristal. C’est même le seul défaut qu’on pourrait lui reprocher, il n’est pas nécessaire que le cœur d’un diplomate soit aussi transparent que le sien. Cela n’empêche pas qu’on parle de l’envoyer à Rome, ce qui est un bel avancement, mais un bien gros morceau. Entre nous, je crois que Vaugoubert, si dénué qu’il soit d’ambition, en serait fort content et ne demande nullement qu’on éloigne de lui ce calice. Il fera peut-être merveille là-bas ; il est le candidat de la Consulta, et pour ma part, je le vois très bien, lui artiste, dans le cadre du palais Farnèse et la galerie des Carraches. Il semble qu’au moins personne ne devrait pouvoir le haïr ; mais il y a autour du roi Théodose toute une camarilla plus ou moins inféodée à la Wilhelmstrasse dont elle suit docilement les inspirations et qui a cherché de toutes façons à lui tailler des croupières. Vaugoubert n’a pas eu à faire face seulement aux intrigues de couloirs mais aux injures de folliculaires à gages qui plus tard, lâches comme l’est tout journaliste stipendié, ont été des premiers à demander l’aman, mais qui en attendant n’ont pas reculé à faire état, contre notre représentant, des ineptes accusations de gens sans aveu. Pendant plus d’un mois les ennemis de Vaugoubert ont dansé autour de lui la danse du scalp, dit M. de Norpois, en détachant avec force ce dernier mot. Mais un bon averti en vaut deux ; ces injures il les a repoussées du pied, ajouta-t-il plus énergiquement encore, et avec un regard si farouche que nous cessâmes un instant de manger. Comme dit un beau proverbe arabe : « Les chiens aboient, la caravane passe. » Après avoir jeté cette citation, M. de Norpois s’arrêta pour nous regarder et juger de l’effet qu’elle avait produit sur nous. Il fut grand, le proverbe nous était connu. Il avait remplacé cette année-là chez les hommes de haute valeur cet autre : « Qui sème le vent récolte la tempête », lequel avait besoin de repos, n’étant pas infatigable et vivace comme : « Travailler pour le roi de Prusse. » Car la culture de ces gens éminents était une culture alternée, et généralement triennale. Certes les citations de ce genre, et desquelles M. de Norpois excellait à émailler ses articles de la Revue, n’étaient point nécessaires pour que ceux-ci parussent solides et bien informés. Même dépourvus de l’ornement qu’elles apportaient, il suffisait que M. de Norpois écrivît à point nommé – ce qu’il ne manquait pas de faire – : « Le Cabinet de Saint-James ne fut pas le dernier à sentir le péril » ou bien : « L’émotion fut grande au Pont-aux-Chantres où l’on suivait d’un œil inquiet la politique égoïste mais habile de la monarchie bicéphale », ou : « Un cri d’alarme partit de Montecitorio », ou encore : « Cet éternel double jeu qui est bien dans la manière du Ballplatz ». À ces expressions le lecteur profane avait aussitôt reconnu et salué le diplomate de carrière. Mais ce qui avait fait dire qu’il était plus que cela, qu’il possédait une culture supérieure, cela avait été l’emploi raisonné de citations dont le modèle achevé restait alors : « Faites-moi de bonne politique et je vous ferai de bonnes finances, comme avait coutume de dire le baron Louis. » (On n’avait pas encore importé d’Orient : « La Victoire est à celui des deux adversaires qui sait souffrir un quart d’heure de plus que l’autre, comme disent les Japonais. ») Cette réputation de grand lettré, jointe à un véritable génie d’intrigue caché sous le masque de l’indifférence, avait fait entrer M. de Norpois à l’Académie des Sciences Morales. Et quelques personnes pensèrent même qu’il ne serait pas déplacé à l’Académie française, le jour où, voulant indiquer que c’est en resserrant l’alliance russe que nous pourrions arriver à une entente avec l’Angleterre, il n’hésita pas à écrire : « Qu’on le sache bien au quai d’Orsay, qu’on l’enseigne désormais dans tous les manuels de géographie qui se montrent incomplets à cet égard, qu’on refuse impitoyablement au baccalauréat tout candidat qui ne saura pas le dire : « Si tous les chemins mènent à Rome, en revanche la route qui va de Paris à Londres passe nécessairement par Pétersbourg. »","– Especially since His Majesty, who is quite accustomed to the fact, wanted to surprise him. This surprise was complete for everyone else, starting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who, as I am told, did not find it to his liking. To someone who spoke to him about it, he would have replied very clearly, loud enough to be heard by people nearby: ""I was neither consulted nor warned"", thereby clearly indicating that he declined all responsibility for the event. It must be admitted that this one caused quite a stir and I would not dare to affirm, he added with a mischievous smile, that some of my colleagues for whom the supreme law seems to be that of the least effort do not have one. not disturbed in their quietude. As for Vaugoubert, you know that he had been strongly attacked for his policy of rapprochement with France, and he must have suffered all the more because he is a sensitive, an exquisite heart. I can all the better testify that, although he is my youngest and by a lot, I have practiced it a lot, we have been friends for a long time, and I know him well. Besides, who wouldn't know him? It is a soul of crystal. It is even the only fault that one could reproach him for, it is not necessary that the heart of a diplomat be as transparent as his. This does not prevent people from talking about sending him to Rome, which is a good step forward, but a very big chunk. Between us, I believe that Vaugoubert, however devoid of ambition, would be very happy with it and in no way asks that this chalice be taken away from him. He may do wonders there; he is the candidate of the Consulta, and for my part, I see him very well, him as an artist, within the framework of the Farnese palace and the Carracci gallery. It seems that at least no one should be able to hate him; but there is around King Theodosius a whole camarilla more or less subservient to the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspirations she obediently follows and who has tried in any way to cut him croupiers. Vaugoubert did not have to face only the intrigues of the corridors but the insults of hired folliculars who later, cowards like any paid journalist, were the first to ask for the lover, but who in the meantime did not did not shy away from pointing out, against our representative, the inane accusations of people without a confession. For more than a month Vaugoubert's enemies danced around him the dance of the scalp, says M. de Norpois, emphasizing this last word with force. But a good warned is worth two; these insults he repelled with his foot,” he added even more energetically, and with such a fierce look that we stopped eating for a moment. As a beautiful Arabic proverb says: “The dogs bark, the caravan passes. After throwing out this quotation, M. de Norpois stopped to look at us and judge of the effect it had produced on us. He was great, the proverb was known to us. He had replaced that year among men of high value this other: ""Who sows the wind reaps the storm"", which needed rest, not being indefatigable and lively like: ""To work for the King of Prussia."" For the culture of these eminent people was an alternating culture, and generally three years. Certainly quotations of this kind, and with which M. de Norpois excelled in sprinkling his articles in the Revue, were not necessary for them to appear solid and well-informed. Even devoid of the ornament they brought, it was enough for M. de Norpois to write at the right time – which he did not fail to do –: “The Cabinet of Saint-James was not the last to feel the danger or: ""The emotion was great at Pont-aux-Chantres where we followed with a worried eye the selfish but skilful policy of the two-headed monarchy"", or: ""A cry of alarm came from Montecitorio"", or again: “This eternal double game which is very much in the way of the Ballplatz”. At these expressions the profane reader immediately recognized and greeted the career diplomat. But what had made people say that he was more than that, that he possessed a superior culture, had been the reasoned use of quotations, the perfect model of which then remained: ""Make good politics for me and I will make you good finances, as Baron Louis used to say. (We had not yet imported from the East: ""Victory belongs to the one of the two adversaries who knows how to suffer a quarter of an hour longer than the other, as the Japanese say."") This reputation as a great scholar, joined to a veritable genius for intrigue hidden under the mask of indifference, had brought M. de Norpois into the Academy of Moral Sciences. And some people even thought that he would not be moved to the French Academy, the day when, wanting to indicate that it is by tightening the Russian alliance that we could reach an understanding with England, he did not hesitate not to write: ""Let it be well known at the Quai d'Orsay, let it be taught from now on in all the geography textbooks which prove to be incomplete in this respect, let it be mercilessly refused to the baccalaureate any candidate who will not know not say it: “If all roads lead to Rome, on the other hand the road which goes from Paris to London necessarily passes through Petersburg. »","""All the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who—I have heard—did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: 'I have been neither consulted nor informed!' indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,"" he went on with a malicious smile, ""that certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an exquisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert's enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,"" M. de Norpois detached this word with sharp emphasis. "" But forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!"" he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. "" In the words of a fine Arab proverb, 'The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!'"" After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and examined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who 'really counted,' of ""He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,"" which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of ""Working for the King of Prussia."" For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well–informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point (as he never failed to write): ""The Court of St. James's was not the last to be sensible of the peril,"" or ""Feeling ran high on the Singers' Bridge, which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,"" or ""A cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,"" or yet again, ""That everlasting double–dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz. "" By these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carrière. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect example of which, at that date, was still: ""Give me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis"": for we had not yet imported from the Far East: ""Victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other, as the Japanese say. "" This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Académie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Académie Française, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: ""Be it clearly understood in the Quai d'Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, 'If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburgh.'""","– Yes, especially since His Majesty made a point of springing it on him by surprise, the sort of thing he is in the habit of doing, I may add. And it was a complete surprise for everybody, not excluding his own Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, as I have been told, did not find it entirely to his taste. He is reported to have said quite unambiguously to someone who broached the matter with him, and in a loud enough voice to be heard by others, ‘I was neither consulted nor warned,’ giving clearly to understand that he took no share of responsibility for the event. It must be admitted that it has stirred up quite a fuss; and I should not care to wager, he went on with a mischievous smile, that certain colleagues of mine, who appear to make a virtue of sloth, have not been disturbed in their repose. As for Vaugoubert, you know he had been roundly attacked for his policy of rapprochement, which must have cut the man to the quick – and he’s so sensitive, he’s the soul of delicacy. I know what I’m saying, you know, for though he’s very much my junior, I have had a great deal to do with him, we have been friends for many a year and I know him well. Who wouldn’t know him, I ask you? The man’s soul is as clear as crystal. Actually, that’s the only fault one could find with him – it’s not necessary for a diplomatist to have a heart as transparent as his. Despite which, there’s talk of sending him to Rome, which would be a great step forward for him, but also a very great challenge. Between ourselves, I suspect that Vaugoubert, though he’s utterly devoid of ambition, would be very pleased if it were true, and has no desire to let that cup pass from him. If he does go to Rome, he may well turn out to be very successful. He’s the candidate favoured by the Consulta; and I for one can see him being well suited, with that artistic bent of his, to the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Carracci gallery.6 One might think that nobody could dislike such a man, though it must be said there is a clique who are close to King Theodosius, who are little more than the creatures of the Wilhelmstrasse,7 always acting in response to its suggestions, and who have definitely attempted to put a spoke in Vaugoubert’s wheel. He has had to contend not only with backstairs intrigues, but with the insults of hired scribblers who, with the cowardice of all stipendiary journalists, and though later they were the first to cry ‘Pax’, had no objection to broadcasting the paltry accusations made against our representative by unprincipled men. Yes, for more than a month, the enemies of Vaugoubert were like a scalping party doing the war-dance, M. de Norpois said, stressing this word. ‘ But forewarned, as we know, is forearmed, and he just kicked the insults aside,’ he said, with even greater force, and a glare that made us stop eating for a moment. ‘As a fine old Arabian proverb puts it: “The dogs bark, the caravan moves on.” ’ M. de Norpois paused, watching us to see what effect this quotation would have on us. It had a great effect: his proverb was well known to us. All worthy men had been using it that year instead of ‘ Sow the wind and reap the whirlwind,’ which was in need of a rest, not being a hardy annual like ‘To labour and to seek for no reward’. The culture of these eminent men was of the alternating variety, usually triennial in its cycle. Not that the articles M. de Norpois wrote for the Revue des Deux Mondes would have appeared less than sound and well informed, had he not deftly sprinkled these sayings throughout them. Even without the ornamentation which they added to his prose, the lay reader could instantly identify and acknowledge the career diplomat in the other type of expression which M. de Norpois could always be relied upon to place aptly in his articles: ‘The Court of St James was not slow to perceive the danger’; or ‘At Pevchesky Bridge, where an anxious eye was kept on the selfish yet astute policy of the Double-Headed Eagle, excitement now reached fever pitch’; or ‘A cry of alarm sounded in the Montecitorio’; or ‘This predictable double game carries the hallmark of the Ballhausplatz. ’8 But what had led some to see in M. de Norpois not just the career diplomat but the man of higher culture was his studied way of using certain quotations, of which the unquestionable paradigm in those days was: ‘Show me sound policies and I’ll show you sound finances, as Baron Louis was fond of saying.’ (This was before the time when we imported from the Far East: ‘Victory goes to him who can hold out for a quarter of an hour longer than his opponent, as the Japanese say.’) It was this reputation as a man of letters, as well as a real genius for intrigue concealed behind a mask of indifference, which had got M. de Norpois elected to the Académie des sciences morales. There were those who became convinced that his rightful place was actually in the Académie française on the day when, in his conviction that it was by strengthening our ties with Russia that we could reach an understanding with England, he did not hesitate to pen the following sentence: ‘Let this be well understood at the Quai d’Orsay, let it figure in all school geography-books which do not make a point of saying so today, let every candidate at the baccalauréat who cannot repeat it be failed out of hand: All roads may lead to Rome, but the road which goes from Paris to London must of necessity pass through St Petersburg.’"

"Parfois une gentille attention de telle ou telle éveillait en moi d’amples vibrations qui éloignaient pour un temps le désir des autres. Ainsi un jour Albertine avait dit : « Qu’est-ce qui a un crayon ? » Andrée l’avait fourni, Rosemonde le papier, Albertine leur avait dit : « Mes petites bonnes femmes, je vous défends de regarder ce que j’écris. » Après s’être appliquée à bien tracer chaque lettre, le papier appuyé à ses genoux, elle me l’avait passé en me disant : « Faites attention qu’on ne voie pas. » Alors je l’avais déplié et j’avais lu ces mots qu’elle m’avait écrits : « Je vous aime bien. »","Sometimes a kind attention from such and such aroused in me ample vibrations which took away for a time the desire of others. So one day Albertine had said: “Who has a pencil? Andrée had provided it, Rosemonde the paper, Albertine had told them: ""My little good women, I forbid you to look at what I write."" After applying herself to tracing each letter carefully, the paper leaning on her knees, she passed it to me, saying: “Be careful that we don’t see. So I unfolded it and read these words she wrote to me: “I like you. »","Now and then a pretty attention from one or another of them would stir in me vibrations which dissipated for a time my desire for the rest. Thus one day Albertine had suddenly asked: ""Who has a pencil?"" Andrée had provided one, Rosemonde the paper; Albertine had warned them: ""Now, young ladies, you are not to look at what I write."" After carefully tracing each letter, supporting the paper on her knee, she had passed it to me with: ""Take care no one sees. "" Whereupon I had unfolded it and read her message, which was: ""I love you.""","Now and then one or other of the girls would favour me in a way which sent a shock-wave of pleasure through me and weakened my desire for any of the others. One day Albertine said, ‘Who’s got a pencil, then?’ Andrée supplied it, Rosemonde proffered some paper and Albertine said, ‘All right, ladies, I forbid you to read what I’m writing.’ She took much trouble over shaping each letter, resting the paper on her knees; then she handed it to me, saying, ‘Make sure no one can read this.’ I unfolded it and read the words she had written: I like you. ‘Look here!’"
"Et quand dans le hall je les rencontrai tous trois, ce fut M. de Vaudémont, le jeune homme riche s’effaçant, qui me dit :","And when I met all three of them in the hall, it was M. de Vaudémont, the rich young man stepping aside, who said to me:","And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaudémont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: ""Won't you give us the pleasure of dining with us?""","When I met all three of them in the vestibule, it was M. de Vaudémont who said, as the wealthy young man hung back:"
"– Oui, Bergotte était là, répondit M. de Norpois, inclinant la tête de mon côté avec courtoisie, comme si dans son désir d’être aimable avec mon père, il attachait à tout ce qui tenait à lui une véritable importance, et même aux questions d’un garçon de mon âge qui n’était pas habitué à se voir montrer tant de politesse par des personnes du sien. Est-ce que vous le connaissez ? ajouta-t-il en fixant sur moi ce regard clair dont Bismarck admirait la pénétration.","""Yes, Bergotte was there,"" replied M. de Norpois, tilting his head towards me courteously, as if in his desire to be kind to my father he attached real importance to everything that belonged to him, and even to the questions of a boy my age who was not used to being shown so much politeness by people of his own. Do you know him? he added, fixing on me that clear gaze whose penetration Bismarck admired.","""Yes, Bergotte was there,"" replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. "" Do you know him?"" he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck.","‘Yes, Bergotte was there,’ M. de Norpois replied, inclining a courteous head towards me, as though in his good-will towards my father he attached real importance to anything connected with him, including the questions of a boy as young as myself, who was unaccustomed to be shown such deference by men as old as himself. ‘Do you know him?’ he added, gazing at me with the bright eyes which Bismarck admired for their acuity."
"Quand quelques jours après le départ de Saint-Loup, j’eus réussi à ce qu’Elstir donnât une petite matinée où je rencontrerais Albertine, le charme et l’élégance tout momentanés qu’on me trouva au moment où je sortais du Grand-Hôtel (et qui était dus à un repos prolongé, à des frais de toilette spéciaux), je regrettai de ne pas pouvoir les réserver (et aussi le crédit d’Elstir) pour la conquête de quelque autre personne plus intéressante, je regrettai de consommer tout cela pour le simple plaisir de faire la connaissance d’Albertine. Mon intelligence jugeait ce plaisir fort peu précieux, depuis qu’il était assuré. Mais en moi la volonté ne partagea pas un instant cette illusion, la volonté qui est le serviteur, persévérant et immuable, de nos personnalités successives ; cachée dans l’ombre, dédaignée, inlassablement fidèle, travaillant sans cesse, et sans se soucier des variations de notre moi, à ce qu’il ne manque jamais du nécessaire. Pendant qu’au moment où va se réaliser un voyage désiré, l’intelligence et la sensibilité commencent à se demander s’il vaut vraiment la peine d’être entrepris, la volonté qui sait que ces maîtres oisifs recommenceraient immédiatement à trouver merveilleux ce voyage, si celui-ci ne pouvait avoir lieu, la volonté les laisse disserter devant la gare, multiplier les hésitations ; mais elle s’occupe de prendre les billets et de nous mettre en wagon pour l’heure du départ. Elle est aussi invariable que l’intelligence et la sensibilité sont changeantes, mais comme elle est silencieuse, ne donne pas ses raisons, elle semble presque inexistante ; c’est sa ferme détermination que suivent les autres parties de notre moi, mais sans l’apercevoir, tandis qu’elles distinguent nettement leurs propres incertitudes. Ma sensibilité et mon intelligence instituèrent donc une discussion sur la valeur du plaisir qu’il y aurait à connaître Albertine tandis que je regardais dans la glace de vains et fragiles agréments qu’elles eussent voulu garder intacts pour une autre occasion. Mais ma volonté ne laissa pas passer l’heure où il fallait partir, et ce fut l’adresse d’Elstir qu’elle donna au cocher. Mon intelligence et ma sensibilité eurent le loisir, puisque le sort en était jeté, de trouver que c’était dommage. Si ma volonté avait donné une autre adresse, elles eussent été bien attrapées.","When, a few days after leaving Saint-Loup, I had succeeded in getting Elstir to give a little matinee where I would meet Albertine, the very momentary charm and elegance that people found in me when I left the Grand- Hotel (and which was due to extended rest, special toilet charges), I regretted that I could not reserve them (and also Elstir's credit) for the conquest of some other more interesting person, I regretted to consume all this for the simple pleasure of getting to know Albertine. My intelligence considered this pleasure very invaluable, since it had been assured. But in me the will did not for a moment share this illusion, the will which is the persevering and immutable servant of our successive personalities; hidden in the shadows, scorned, tirelessly faithful, working without ceasing, and without worrying about the variations of our self, so that there is never a lack of the necessary. While at the moment when a desired journey is about to take place, the intelligence and the sensibility begin to ask themselves if it is really worth undertaking, the will which knows that these idle masters would immediately begin to find this journey marvelous again. , if this could not take place, the will leaves them to discuss in front of the station, to multiply the hesitations; but she takes care of taking the tickets and putting us in the wagon for the hour of departure. It is as invariable as intelligence and sensibility are changeable, but since it is silent, does not give its reasons, it seems almost non-existent; it is its firm determination that the other parts of our self follow, but without noticing it, while they clearly distinguish their own uncertainties. My sensitivity and my intelligence therefore instituted a discussion on the value of the pleasure there would be in knowing Albertine while I looked in the mirror at the vain and fragile amenities that they would have liked to keep intact for another occasion. But my will did not let the hour when I had to leave pass, and it was Elstir's address that she gave to the coachman. My intelligence and my sensitivity had the leisure, since the die was cast, to find that it was a pity. If my will had given another address, they would have been caught.","When, some days after Saint–Loup's departure, I had succeeded in persuading Elstir to give a small tea–party, at which I was to meet Albertine, that freshness of appearance, that smartness of attire, both (alas) fleeting, which were to be observed in me at the moment of my starting out from the Grand Hotel, and were due respectively to a longer rest than usual and to special pains over my toilet , I regretted my inability to reserve them (and also the credit accruing from Elstir's friendship) for the captivation of some other, more interesting person; I regretted having to use them all up on the simple pleasure of making Albertine's acquaintance. My brain assessed this pleasure at a very low value now that it was assured me. But, inside, my will did not for a moment share this illusion , that will which is the persevering and unalterable servant of our successive personalities; hiding itself in secret places, despised, downtrodden, untiringly faithful, toiling without intermission and with no thought for the variability of the self, its master, if only that master may never lack what he requires. Whereas at the moment when we are just about to start on a long–planned and eagerly awaited holiday, our brain, our nerves begin to ask themselves whether it is really worth all the trouble involved, the will, knowing that those lazy masters would at once begin to consider their journey the most wonderful experience, if it became impossible for them to take it, the will leaves them explaining their difficulties outside the station, multiplying their hesitations; but busies itself with taking the tickets and putting us into the carriage before the train starts. It is as invariable as brain and nerves are fickle, but as it is silent, gives no account of its actions, it seems almost non–existent; it is by its dogged determination that the other constituent parts of our personality are led, but without seeing it, while they distinguish clearly all their own uncertainties. My nerves and brain then started a discussion as to the real value of the pleasure that there would be in knowing Albertine, while I studied in the glass vain and perishable attractions which nerves and brain would have preserved intact for use on some other occasion. But my will would not let the hour pass at which I must start, and 'it was Elstir's address that it called out to the driver. Brain and nerves were at liberty, now that the die was cast, to think this 'a pity.' If my will had given the man a different address, they would have been finely 'sold.'","Some days after the departure of Saint-Loup, when I had managed to prompt Elstir to hold a little reception at which I would be able to meet Albertine, I was rather sorry that the charm and elegance, albeit momentary, on which I was complimented as I stepped out of the Grand-Hôtel, which were the result of a long rest and extra expenditure on appearance, could not be reserved, along with the prestige of Elstir, for my conquest of some other more interesting person, rather than being lavished on Albertine and the pleasure of making her acquaintance. My mind saw this pleasure, now that it was assured, as being worth not very much. But the will in me did not share that illusion for an instant, being the persevering and unwavering servant of our successive personalities, hidden in the shadows, disdained, forever faithful, working unceasingly, and without heeding the variability of our self, making sure it shall never lack what it needs. When a journey we have longed to make begins to become a reality, and the mind and sensibility are starting to wonder whether it is really worth the effort, the will, which well knows that, if it turned out the journey could not be made, these feckless masters would immediately long for it to become possible again, lets them loiter in front of the station, having their say, hesitating until the last minute, while it makes sure of buying the tickets and getting us into the train before departure time. It is as invariable as the mind and sensibility are changeable; but because it is silent and never gives its reasons, it seems almost non-existent; all the other parts of our self march to its tune unawares, though they can always see clearly their own uncertainties. So my mind and sensibility set up a debate on how much pleasure there might be in making the acquaintance of Albertine, while in front of the mirror I considered the vain and fragile charms which they would have preferred to preserve unused for some better occasion. But my will did not lose sight of the time at which I had to leave; and it was Elstir’s address which it gave to the coachman. My mind and sensibility, now that the die was cast, indulged in the luxury of thinking it was a pity. If my will had given a different address, they would have been in a state of panic."
"Le directeur m’offrait pour l’année prochaine de meilleures chambres, mais j’étais attaché maintenant à la mienne où j’entrais sans plus jamais sentir l’odeur du vétiver, et dont ma pensée, qui s’y élevait jadis si difficilement, avait fini par prendre si exactement les dimensions que je fus obligé de lui faire subir un traitement inverse quand je dus coucher à Paris dans mon ancienne chambre, laquelle était basse de plafond.","The director offered me better rooms for next year, but I was now attached to mine, into which I entered without ever smelling the smell of vetiver again, and from which my thoughts, which had once , had ended up taking the dimensions so exactly that I was obliged to subject it to the opposite treatment when I had to sleep in Paris in my old room, which had a low ceiling.","The manager offered to reserve better rooms for me next year, but I had now become attached to mine, into which I went without ever noticing the scent of flowering grasses, while my mind, which had once found such difficulty in rising to fill its space had come now to take its measurements so exactly that I was obliged to submit it to a reverse process when I had to sleep in Paris, in my own room, the ceiling of which was low.","For next year, the manager promised me better rooms; but by now I was attached to mine: I could walk into it without noticing the slightest smell of vetiver; and my mind, which had once had such difficulty in occupying its upper reaches, had fitted itself so accurately into the room’s dimensions that I had to train it to do the opposite, once I was back in Paris and getting ready for bed in my old room, which had a low ceiling."
"Saint-Loup avait si peur d’avoir mal remercié ma grand-mère qu’il me chargeait encore de lui dire sa gratitude le surlendemain, dans une lettre que je reçus de lui de la ville où il était en garnison et qui semblait, sur l’enveloppe où la poste en avait timbré le nom, accourir vite vers moi, me dire qu’entre ses murs, dans le quartier de cavalerie Louis XVI, il pensait à moi. Le papier était aux armes de Marsantes dans lesquelles je distinguais un lion que surmontait une couronne formée par un bonnet de pair de France.","Saint-Loup was so afraid that he had badly thanked my grandmother that he again asked me to express his gratitude to her two days later, in a letter which I received from him from the town where he was in garrison and which seemed, on the envelope on which the post office had stamped his name, run quickly to me, tell me that within his walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was in the arms of Marsantes in which I distinguished a lion surmounted by a crown formed by a cap of a peer of France.","Saint–Loup was still so much afraid of not having thanked my grandmother properly that he charged me once again to express his gratitude to her a day or two later in a letter I received from him from the town in which he was quartered, a town which seemed, on the envelope where the post–mark had stamped its name, to be hastening to me across country, to tell me that within its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was embossed with the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion, surmounted by a coronet formed by the cap of a Peer of France.","Saint-Loup was so uneasy at the thought of not having properly thanked my grandmother that he asked me again to be sure to pass on his gratitude to her, in a letter that I received two days later. It was from the town where he was garrisoned, the name of which postmarked on the envelope seemed to be bringing it to me, telling me that inside its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The notepaper bore the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion on a crown closed by the cap of a peer of France."
"– Alors c’est entendu, demain je suis libre, si vous avez quelqu’un, vous n’oublierez pas de me faire chercher.","– So it’s understood, tomorrow I’m free, if you have someone, you won’t forget to send for me.","But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: ""That's settled then; I shall be free to–morrow, if you have anyone you won't forget to send for me.""","‘So that’s agreed, all right? I’m available tomorrow and if you’ve got somebody you’ll be sure to send round for me?’"
"Les joies intellectuelles que je goûtais dans cet atelier ne m’empêchaient nullement de sentir, quoiqu’ils nous entourassent comme malgré nous, les tièdes glacis, la pénombre étincelante de la pièce, et au bout de la petite fenêtre encadrée de chèvrefeuilles, dans l’avenue toute rustique, la résistante sécheresse de la terre brûlée de soleil que voilait seulement la transparence de l’éloignement et de l’ombre des arbres. Peut-être l’inconscient bien-être que me causait ce jour d’été venait-il agrandir comme un affluent la joie que me causait la vue du « Port de Carquethuit ».","The intellectual joys that I tasted in this studio in no way prevented me from feeling, although they surrounded us as if in spite of ourselves, the warm glazes, the sparkling penumbra of the room, and at the end of the little window framed with honeysuckles, in the utterly rustic avenue, the resistant dryness of the sun-scorched earth veiled only by the transparency of the distance and the shade of the trees. Perhaps the unconscious well-being that this summer day caused me increased like an affluent the joy that the sight of the ""Port of Carquethuit"" caused me.","The intellectual pleasures which I enjoyed in this studio did not in the least prevent me from feeling, although they enveloped us as it were in spite of ourselves, the warm polish, the sparkling gloom of the place itself and, through the little window framed in honeysuckle, in the avenue that was quite rustic, the resisting dryness of the sun–parched earth, screened only by the diaphanous gauze woven of distance and of a tree–cast shade. Perhaps the unaccountable feeling of comfort which this summer day was giving me came like a tributary to swell the flood of joy that had surged in me at the sight of Elstir's Carquethuit Harbour.","The intellectual pleasures I enjoyed by being in the studio did not prevent me from taking pleasure in other things, though they surrounded us in an incidental way: the room, with the tepid scumbles of its walls, its glowing penumbra; and beyond the little window set among honeysuckle, along the rural-looking road, the rough, desiccated surface of the sunburnt earth, which distance and the shadows of trees did no more than hazily veil. Perhaps the unconscious well-being drawn from the summer’s day helped to swell, like a tributary, the joy I had taken in seeing Harbour at Carquethuit."
"Cinq messieurs passèrent que je connaissais très bien de vue depuis que j’étais à Balbec. Je m’étais souvent demandé qui ils étaient. « Ce ne sont pas des gens très chics, me dit Albertine en ricanant d’un air de mépris. Le petit vieux, qui a des gants jaunes, il en a une touche, hein, il dégotte bien, c’est le dentiste de Balbec, c’est un brave type ; le gros, c’est le maire, pas le tout petit gros, celui-là vous devez l’avoir vu, c’est le professeur de danse, il est assez moche aussi, il ne peut pas nous souffrir parce que nous faisons trop de bruit au Casino, que nous démolissons ses chaises, que nous voulons danser sans tapis, aussi il ne nous a jamais donné le prix quoique il n’y a que nous qui sachions danser. Le dentiste est un brave homme, je lui aurais fait bonjour pour faire rager le maître de danse, mais je ne pouvais pas parce qu’il y a avec eux M. de Sainte-Croix, le conseiller général, un homme d’une très bonne famille qui s’est mis du côté des républicains, pour de l’argent ; aucune personne propre ne le salue plus. Il connaît mon oncle, à cause du gouvernement, mais le reste de ma famille lui a tourné le dos. Le maigre avec un imperméable, c’est le chef d’orchestre. Comment, vous ne le connaissez pas ! Il joue divinement. Vous n’avez pas été entendre Cavalleria Rusticana ? Ah ! je trouve ça idéal ! Il donne un concert ce soir, mais nous ne pouvons pas y aller parce que ça a lieu dans la salle de la Mairie. Au casino ça ne fait rien, mais dans la salle de la Mairie d’où on a enlevé le Christ, la mère d’Andrée tomberait en apoplexie si nous y allions. Vous me direz que le mari de ma tante est dans le gouvernement. Mais qu’est-ce que vous voulez ? Ma tante est ma tante. Ce n’est pas pour cela que je l’aime ! Elle n’a jamais eu qu’un désir, se débarrasser de moi. La personne qui m’a vraiment servi de mère, et qui a eu double mérite puisqu’elle ne m’est rien, c’est une amie que j’aime du reste comme une mère. Je vous montrerai sa photo. » Nous fûmes abordés un instant par le champion de golf et joueur de baccara, Octave. Je pensai avoir découvert un lien entre nous, car j’appris dans la conversation qu’il était un peu parent, et de plus assez aimé des Verdurin. Mais il parla avec dédain des fameux mercredis, et ajouta que M. Verdurin ignorait l’usage du smoking, ce qui rendait assez gênant de le rencontrer dans certains « music-halls » où on aurait tant aimé ne pas s’entendre crier : « Bonjour, galopin » par un monsieur en veston et en cravate noire de notaire de village. Puis Octave nous quitta, et bientôt après ce fut le tour d’Andrée, arrivée devant son chalet où elle entra sans que de toute la promenade elle m’eût dit un seul mot. Je regrettai d’autant plus son départ que tandis que je faisais remarquer à Albertine combien son amie avait été froide avec moi, et rapprochais en moi-même cette difficulté qu’Albertine semblait avoir à me lier avec ses amies de l’hostilité contre laquelle, pour exaucer mon souhait, paraissait s’être le premier jour heurté Elstir, passèrent des jeunes filles que je saluai, les demoiselles d’Ambresac, auxquelles Albertine dit aussi bonjour.","Five gentlemen passed by, whom I had known very well by sight since I had been at Balbec. I had often wondered who they were. ""They're not very smart people,"" Albertine told me, chuckling contemptuously. The little old man, who has yellow gloves, he has a touch of them, eh, he's got a good taste, he's the dentist from Balbec, he's a good guy; the fat one is the mayor, not the tiny fat one, you must have seen that one, it's the dance teacher, he's pretty ugly too, he can't put up with us because we do too much noise at the Casino, that we demolish his chairs, that we want to dance without a carpet, so he never gave us the prize although only we know how to dance. The dentist is a good man, I would have said hello to him to make the dancing master furious, but I couldn't because there is with them M. de Sainte-Croix, the general counsellor, a man of very good family who sided with the Republicans for money; no clean person greets him anymore. He knows my uncle, because of the government, but the rest of my family has turned their back on him. The skinny guy with a raincoat is the conductor. How, you don't know him! He plays divinely. Didn't you hear Cavalleria Rusticana? Ah! I find it ideal! He's giving a concert tonight, but we can't go because it's in the town hall. In the casino it doesn't matter, but in the hall of the Town Hall from where the Christ was removed, Andrée's mother would fall into a stroke if we went there. You will tell me that my aunt's husband is in the government. But what do you want? My aunt is my aunt. That's not why I love him! She only ever had one wish, to get rid of me. The person who has really served as my mother, and who has had double merit since she is nothing to me, is a friend whom, moreover, I love like a mother. I'll show you his picture. We were accosted for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat player, Octave. I thought I had discovered a connection between us, for I learned in the conversation that he was somewhat of a relative, and moreover quite fond of the Verdurins. But he spoke with disdain of the famous Wednesdays, and added that M. Verdurin was unaware of the use of the tuxedo, which made it rather embarrassing to meet him in certain ""music halls"" where one would have liked so much not to hear oneself shouting: "" Bonjour, rascal” by a gentleman in the jacket and black tie of a village notary. Then Octave left us, and soon afterwards it was Andrée's turn, arriving in front of her chalet, which she entered without saying a single word to me during the whole walk. I regretted her departure all the more because, while I pointed out to Albertine how cold her friend had been towards me, and compared in myself this difficulty which Albertine seemed to have in binding me with her friends to the hostility against which , to grant my wish, seemed to have bumped into Elstir on the first day, passed some young girls whom I greeted, the young ladies of Ambresac, to whom Albertine also said hello.","A party of five were passing, men whom I had come to know very well by sight during my stay at Balbec. I had often wondered who they could be. ""They're nothing very wonderful,"" said Albertine with a sneering laugh. ""The little old one with dyed hair and yellow gloves has a fine touch; he knows how to draw all right, he's the Balbec dentist; he's a good sort. The fat one is the Mayor, not the tiny little fat one, you must have seen him before, he's the dancing master; he's rather a beast, you know ; he can't stand us, because we make such a row at the Casino; we smash his chairs, and want to have the carpet up when we dance; that's why he never gives us prizes, though we're the only girls there who can dance a bit. The dentist is a dear, I would have said how d'ye do to him, just to make the dancing master swear, but I couldn't because they've got M. de Sainte–Croix with them; he's on the General Council; he comes of a very good family, but he's joined the Republicans, to make more money. No nice people ever speak to him now. He knows my uncle, because they're both in the Government, but the rest of my family always cut him. The thin one in the waterproof is the bandmaster. You know him, of course. You don't? Oh, he plays divinely. You haven't been to Cavalleria Rusticana? I thought it too lovely! He's giving a concert this evening, but we can't go because it's to be in the town hall. In the Casino it wouldn't matter, but in the town hall, where they've taken down the crucifix. Andrée's mother would have a fit if we went there. You're going to say that my aunt's husband is in the Government. But what difference does that make? My aunt is my aunt. That's not why I'm fond of her. The only thing she has ever wanted has been to get rid of me. No, the person who has really been a mother to me, and all the more credit to her because she's no relation at all, is a friend of mine whom I love just as much as if she was my mother. I will let you see her 'photo.' "" We were joined for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat plunger, Octave. I thought that I had discovered a bond between us, for I learned in the course of conversation that he was some sort of relative, and even more a friend of the Verdurins. But he spoke contemptuously of the famous Wednesdays, adding that M. Verdurin had never even heard of a dinner–jacket, which made it a horrid bore when one ran into him in a music–hall, where one would very much rather not be greeted with ""Well, you young rascal,"" by an old fellow in a frock coat and black tie, for all the world like a village lawyer. Octave left us, and soon it was Andrée's turn, when we came to her villa, into which she vanished without having uttered a single word to me during the whole of our walk. I regretted her departure, all the more in that, while I was complaining to Albertine how chilling her friend had been with me, and was comparing in my mind this difficulty which Albertine seemed to find in making me know her friends with the hostility that Elstir, when he might have granted my desire, seemed to have encountered on that first afternoon, two girls came by to whom I lifted my hat, the young Ambresacs, whom Albertine greeted also.","Five gentlemen walked past; since the beginning of my stay at Balbec, I had come to know all of them well by sight, and had often wondered who they might be. ‘They’re not very posh people, Albertine said, with a snigger of contempt. Take a look at that little old bloke with the dyed hair and the yellow gloves! Isn’t he the limit? Well, he’s the local dentist, not a bad old bloke, actually. The fat one’s the Mayor. I don’t mean the little fat one – you must have seen him , he’s the dancing-master; he’s a bit of a brute too: he can’t stand us because we make too much noise at the Casino , we demolish his chairs, we want to dance with the carpet rolled up, so he’s never given us the prize, though we’re the only ones that can dance! The dentist’s quite a nice bloke, and I wouldn’t have minded saying hello to him just to annoy the dancing-master, but I couldn’t because that’s M. de Sainte-Croix with them, the member of the Conseil général,97 a gentleman of very good family but who’s gone over to the Republicans now, for money – all proper people ignore him totally. He knows my uncle, because of the government, but the rest of my family cut him dead. The thin one in the raincoat is the conductor of the orchestra. What? You don’t know him? His playing’s divine! You didn’t go and hear Cavalleria Rusticana?98 Oh, I think it’s just lovely! He’s giving a concert this evening but we can’t go because it’s in the Town Hall – the Casino’s all right, but the Town Hall’s out of bounds: they’ve gone and taken down the crucifix99 and Andrée ’s mother would throw forty fits if we went! I know my aunt’s husband’s in the government, but I can’t help that – my aunt may be my aunt, but that doesn’t make me like her, you know! She has only ever wanted one thing – to get rid of me. The only person who was ever anything like a mother to me – and who really deserves double credit for it, as she’s not even family – is a friend that I actually love like a mother. I’ll show you a photo of her.’ We were briefly joined by the golf champion and baccarat player, Octave. I thought I might have discovered a link between us, on learning from the conversation that he had some slight family relationship with the Verdurins, who were also rather fond of him. However, he disparaged the celebrated Wednesdays, and added that M. Verdurin was ignorant of the proper wearing of the dinner-jacket, which made it pretty embarrassing to encounter him in certain music-halls, where one would rather not be accosted by a gentleman wearing an ordinary suit and a black tie, looking like a village notary up in town and calling out, ‘Good evening, whipper-snapper!’ Octave walked on; and soon afterwards Andrée also left us, as we had reached her chalet. She went in, having said not a single word to me throughout the whole walk. I was sorry to see her disappear, especially because, while I was remarking to Albertine how unfriendly her friend had been, and mentally comparing the difficulty Albertine appeared to have in letting me make the acquaintance of her girl-friends with the reluctance Elstir had also seemed to encounter on the very first day in trying to effect the same thing, two young girls passed, the d’Ambresac sisters, whom I greeted and to whom Albertine also said good morning."
"Sans doute bien des fois, au passage de jolies jeunes filles, je m’étais fait la promesse de les revoir. D’habitude, elles ne reparaissent pas ; d’ailleurs la mémoire, qui oublie vite leur existence, retrouverait difficilement leurs traits ; nos yeux ne les reconnaîtraient peut-être pas, et déjà nous avons vu passer de nouvelles jeunes filles que nous ne reverrons pas non plus. Mais d’autres fois, et c’est ainsi que cela devait arriver pour la petite bande insolente, le hasard les ramène avec insistance devant nous. Il nous paraît alors beau, car nous discernons en lui comme un commencement d’organisation, d’effort, pour composer notre vie ; il nous rend facile, inévitable et quelquefois – après des interruptions qui ont pu faire espérer de cesser de nous souvenir – cruelle la fidélité des images à la possession desquelles nous nous croirons plus tard avoir été prédestinés, et que sans lui nous aurions pu, tout au début, oublier, comme tant d’autres, si aisément.","No doubt many times, when pretty young girls passed by, I had made a promise to myself to see them again. Usually they do not reappear; besides, memory, which quickly forgets their existence, would find it difficult to find their features; our eyes might not recognize them, and we have already seen new young girls passing by whom we shall not see again either. But other times, and this is how it was to happen for the insolent little gang, chance brings them insistently back before us. It then seems beautiful to us, because we discern in it a beginning of organization, of effort, to compose our life; it makes easy, inevitable and sometimes – after interruptions which have made us hope to stop remembering – cruel the fidelity of the images to the possession of which we will believe ourselves later to have been predestined, and that without it we could have, all at first, forgetting, like so many others, so easily.","Repeatedly, I dare say, when pretty girls went by, I had promised myself that I would see them again. As a rule, people do not appear a second time; moreover our memory, which speedily forgets their existence, would find it difficult to recall their appearance; our eyes would not recognise them, perhaps, and in the meantime we have seen new girls go by, whom we shall not see again either. But at other times, and this was what was to happen with the pert little band at Balbec, chance brings them back insistently before our eyes. Chance seems to us then a good and useful thing, for we discern in it as it were rudiments of organisation, of an attempt to arrange our life; and it makes easy to us, inevitable, and sometimes—after interruptions that have made us hope that we may cease to remember— cruel, the retention in our minds of images to the possession of which we shall come in time to believe that we were predestined, and which but for chance we should from the very first have managed to forget, like so many others, with so little difficulty.","Of course, when I saw pretty girls pass by, I often promised myself I would make a point of seeing them again. Usually, such girls make no reappearance in one’s life; and memory, quickly mislaying their existence, would be hard put to remember their features; perhaps our eyes would not even recognize them again, and before long we see others passing by, whom we shall not see again either. However, on other occasions – and this was what was to happen with this little gang of impudent girls – further chance encounters bring them back into our field of vision. In such chance there is seeming beauty, for we see in it an incipient intent or effort to organize our life, to give it shape; and it is this same chance which can make it easy for us, inevitable and sometimes even cruel – after intermissions which may have made us hope for a cessation of such memories – for us to acquire a sort of fidelity to mental images which we may come to believe we were predestined to acquire, yet which, had it not been for that chance, we could have forgotten at the very beginning, like so many others, so easily."
"– En effet, elle est du style roman, qui est déjà par lui-même extrêmement froid et ne laisse en rien présager l’élégance, la fantaisie des architectes gothiques qui fouillent la pierre comme de la dentelle. L’église de Balbec mérite une visite si on est dans le pays, elle est assez curieuse ; si un jour de pluie vous ne savez que faire, vous pourrez entrer là, vous verrez le tombeau de Tourville.","– Indeed, it is of the Romanesque style, which is already by itself extremely cold and in no way suggests the elegance, the fantasy of the Gothic architects who search the stone like lace. The church of Balbec is worth a visit if you are in the country, it is quite curious; if on a rainy day you don't know what to do, you can enter there, you will see the tomb of Tourville.","""Why, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.""","– Absolutely. It is in the Romanesque manner, which is of course one reason among others why it is so frigid. It’s a style which in no way seems to foreshadow the elegance, the delicate inventiveness of the Gothic architects, who could work the stone like lace. No doubt the church of Balbec is worth a visit, if one happens to be in the vicinity – you could while away a rainy afternoon if you had nothing better to do, take a look inside, see the tomb of Admiral de Tourville.10"

"Je revins à M. de Norpois. « Ne vous y fiez pas, il est au contraire très mauvaise langue », dit Mme Swann avec un accent qui me parut d’autant plus signifier que M. de Norpois avait mal parlé d’elle, que Swann regarda sa femme d’un air de réprimande et comme pour l’empêcher d’en dire davantage.","I returned to M. de Norpois. ""Don't be fooled by it, he is on the contrary very bad language,"" said Madame Swann with an accent which seemed to me all the more to signify that M. de Norpois had spoken badly of her, that Swann looked at his wife with a look of reprimand and as if to prevent him from saying more.","I reverted to M. de Norpois. ""You must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!"" said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been 'saying things' about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far.","I reverted to M. de Norpois. ‘I wouldn’t trust him – he’s always saying things behind people’s backs,’ Mme Swann said in a way which, partly because Swann gave her a quick glance of disapproval, as though to warn her against saying anything more, made me suspect that M. de Norpois must have had something to say behind hers."
"Nous formions ce matin-là un de ces couples qui piquent çà et là la digue de leur conjonction, de leur arrêt, juste le temps d’échanger quelques paroles avant de se désunir pour reprendre séparément chacun sa promenade divergente. Je profitai de cette immobilité pour regarder et savoir définitivement où était situé le grain de beauté. Or, comme une phrase de Vinteuil qui m’avait enchanté dans la Sonate et que ma mémoire faisait errer de l’andante au finale jusqu’au jour où, ayant la partition en main, je pus la trouver et l’immobiliser dans mon souvenir à sa place, dans le scherzo, de même le grain de beauté que je m’étais rappelé tantôt sur la joue, tantôt sur le menton, s’arrêta à jamais sur la lèvre supérieure au-dessous du nez. C’est ainsi encore que nous rencontrons avec étonnement des vers que nous savons par cœur, dans une pièce où nous ne soupçonnions pas qu’ils se trouvassent.","That morning we formed one of those couples who puncture here and there the dyke with their conjunction, their stopping, just long enough to exchange a few words before breaking up to each resume their divergent walk separately. I took advantage of this immobility to look and know definitively where the mole was located. Now, like a sentence of Vinteuil which had enchanted me in the Sonata and which my memory made wander from the andante to the finale until the day when, having the score in hand, I was able to find it and immobilize it in my memory in its place, in the scherzo, likewise the mole that I had remembered now on the cheek, now on the chin, stopped forever on the upper lip below the nose. It is thus again that we meet with astonishment verses that we know by heart, in a room where we did not suspect that they were.","We formed that morning one of those couples who dotted the 'front' here and there with their conjunction, their stopping together for time enough just to exchange a few words before breaking apart, each to resume separately his or her divergent stroll. I seized the opportunity, while she stood still, to look again and discover once and for all where exactly the little mole was placed. Then, just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my recollection allowed to wander from the andante to the finale, until the day when, having the score in my hands, I was able to find it, and to fix it in my memory in its proper place, in the scherzo, so this mole, which I had visualised now on her cheek, now on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just below her nose. In the same way, too, do we come with amazement upon lines that we know by heart in a poem in which we never dreamed that they were to be found.","That morning, we were one of the couples who here and there punctuate the esplanade with their momentary meetings, pausing long enough to exchange a few words before separating to take up again their two diverging trajectories. I took advantage of this brief immobility to make a thorough check of the place where the beauty spot was to be found. Just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my memory kept moving from the andante to the finale, until the day when, with the score in hand, I was able to find it and localize it where it belonged, in the scherzo, so the beauty spot, which I had remembered on her cheek, then on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just under her nose. In the same way, we are astonished to come upon a stanza we know by heart, but in a poem which we did not realize contained it."
"– Oh, je t’en prie, me dit-elle. C’est une telle joie pour ta grand’mère. Et surtout ne manque pas de frapper au mur si tu as besoin de quelque chose cette nuit, mon lit est adossé au tien, la cloison est très mince. D’ici un moment quand tu seras couché fais-le, pour voir si nous nous comprenons bien.","""Oh, please,"" she told me. It's such a joy for your grandmother. And don't forget to knock on the wall if you need something tonight, my bed is leaning against yours, the partition is very thin. In a while when you're in bed do it, to see if we understand each other well.","""Oh, do let me!"" she begged. ""It is such a joy for your Granny. And be sure you knock on the wall if you want anything in the night. My bed is just on the other side, and the partition is, quite thin. Just give a knock now, as soon as you are ready, so that we shall know where we are.""","‘Please! Let me! she said. Your old grandma loves to do it. And you must be sure to knock on the wall if you need anything during the night. My bed’s back to back with yours, you know, and it’s just a partition. In a moment, once you’ve hopped into bed, you try knocking and we’ll see how easy it is to communicate.’"
"Mais cette souffrance et ce regain d’amour pour Gilberte ne furent pas plus longs que ceux qu’on a en rêve, et cette fois, au contraire, parce qu’à Balbec l’Habitude ancienne n’était plus là pour les faire durer. Et si ces effets de l’Habitude semblent contradictoires, c’est qu’elle obéit à des lois multiples. À Paris j’étais devenu de plus en plus indifférent à Gilberte, grâce à l’Habitude. Le changement d’habitude, c’est-à-dire la cessation momentanée de l’Habitude, paracheva l’œuvre de l’Habitude quand je partis pour Balbec. Elle affaiblit mais stabilise, elle amène la désagrégation mais la fait durer indéfiniment. Chaque jour depuis des années je calquais tant bien que mal mon état d’âme sur celui de la veille. À Balbec un lit nouveau à côté duquel on m’apportait le matin un petit déjeuner différent de celui de Paris ne devait plus soutenir les pensées dont s’était nourri mon amour pour Gilberte : il y a des cas (assez rares il est vrai) où, la sédentarité immobilisant les jours, le meilleur moyen de gagner du temps, c’est de changer de place. Mon voyage à Balbec fut comme la première sortie d’un convalescent qui n’attendait plus qu’elle pour s’apercevoir qu’il est guéri.","But this suffering and this revival of love for Gilberte did not last longer than those we have in dreams, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to make them last. . And if these effects of the Habit seem contradictory, it is because it obeys multiple laws. In Paris I had become more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed the work of Habit when I left for Balbec. It weakens but stabilizes, it brings disintegration but makes it last indefinitely. Every day for years, I had somehow modeled my state of mind on that of the day before. At Balbec a new bed next to which they brought me in the morning a breakfast different from that in Paris should no longer support the thoughts on which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (quite rare it is true) where, the sedentary lifestyle immobilizing the days, the best way to save time is to change places. My trip to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who was only waiting for her to realize that he was cured.","But this suffering and this recrudescence of my love for Gilberte lasted no longer than such things last in a dream, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to keep them alive. And if these two effects of Habit appear to be incompatible, that is because Habit is bound by a diversity of laws. In Paris I had grown more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed Habit's task when I started for Balbec. It weakens, but it stabilises; it leads to disintegration but it makes the scattered elements last indefinitely. Day after day, for years past, I had begun by modelling my state of mind, more or less effectively, upon that of the day before. At Balbec, a strange bed, to the side of which a tray was brought in the morning that differed from my Paris breakfast tray, could not, obviously, sustain the fancies upon which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (though not, I admit, commonly) in which, one's days being paralysed by a sedentary life, the best way to save time is to change one's place of residence. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who needed only that to convince him that he was cured.","However, this recurrence of pain and the renewal of my love for Gilberte did not last longer than they would have in a dream of her, for the very reason that my life at Balbec was free of the habits which in usual circumstances would have helped it to prevail. Such effects of Habit may seem contradictory; but the laws which govern it are many and varied. In Paris, it was because of Habit that I had become more and more indifferent to Gilberte. The change in my habits, that is the momentary suspension of Habit, put its finishing touch to that process when I set off for Balbec. Habit may weaken all things, but it also stabilizes them; it brings about a dislocation, but then makes it last indefinitely. For years past, I had been roughly modelling my state of mind each day on my state of mind of the day before. At Balbec, breakfast in bed – a different bed, a different breakfast – was to be incapable of nourishing the ideas on which my love for Gilberte had fed in Paris. There are instances, albeit infrequent, in which, the passing days having been immobilized by a sedentary way of life, the best way to gain time is to change place. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who has not noticed until that moment that he is completely cured."
– Mais il n’y aurait pas eu possibilité de la présenter au comte de Paris ? demanda mon père.,"""But wouldn't it have been possible to present her to the Comte de Paris?"" asked my father.","""But there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?"" inquired my father.","– But it would surely have been quite out of the question, my father said, to present her to the Comte de Paris?"
"J’allais passer par une de ces conjonctures difficiles en face desquelles il arrive généralement qu’on se trouve à plusieurs reprises dans la vie et auxquelles, bien qu’on n’ait pas changé de caractère, de nature – notre nature qui crée elle-même nos amours, et presque les femmes que nous aimons, et jusqu’à leurs fautes – on ne fait pas face de la même manière à chaque fois, c’est-à-dire à tout âge. À ces moments-là notre vie est divisée, et comme distribuée dans une balance, en deux plateaux opposés où elle tient tout entière. Dans l’un, il y a notre désir de ne pas déplaire, de ne pas paraître trop humble à l’être que nous aimons sans parvenir à le comprendre, mais que nous trouvons plus habile de laisser un peu de côté pour qu’il n’ait pas ce sentiment de se croire indispensable qui le détournerait de nous ; de l’autre côté, il y a une souffrance – non pas une souffrance localisée et partielle – qui ne pourrait au contraire être apaisée que si renonçant à plaire à cette femme et à lui faire croire que nous pouvons nous passer d’elle, nous allions la retrouver. Quand on retire du plateau où est la fierté une petite quantité de volonté qu’on a eu la faiblesse de laisser s’user avec l’âge, qu’on ajoute dans le plateau où est le chagrin une souffrance physique acquise et à qui on a permis de s’aggraver, et au lieu de la solution courageuse qui l’aurait emporté à vingt ans, c’est l’autre, devenue trop lourde et sans assez de contre-poids, qui nous abaisse à cinquante. D’autant plus que les situations tout en se répétant changent, et qu’il y a chance pour qu’au milieu ou à la fin de la vie on ait eu pour soi-même la funeste complaisance de compliquer l’amour d’une part d’habitude que l’adolescence, retenue par d’autres devoirs, moins libre de soi-même, ne connaît pas.","I was going to go through one of those difficult conjunctures which it generally happens that we find ourselves on several occasions in life and which, although we have not changed in character, in nature – our nature which creates it -even our loves, and almost the women we love, and even their faults – we don't face the same way every time, that is to say at any age. At such times our life is divided, as if distributed in a balance, into two opposite plates where it holds together. In one, there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the being we love without managing to understand him, but whom we find more skilful to leave aside a little so that he does not have this feeling of believing himself indispensable which would turn him away from us; on the other side, there is a suffering - not a localized and partial suffering - which could on the contrary be appeased only if giving up pleasing this woman and making her believe that we can do without her, we were going to find her. When we remove from the plateau where pride is a small amount of will that we had the weakness to let wear out with age, when we add to the plateau where grief is an acquired physical suffering and to which we has made it possible to get worse, and instead of the courageous solution which would have won him at twenty, it is the other, which has become too heavy and without enough counterweight, which lowers us to fifty. All the more so since the situations change while repeating themselves, and there is a chance that in the middle or at the end of life one has had for oneself the disastrous complacency of complicating the love of a part of habit that adolescence, restrained by other duties, less free of itself, does not know.","I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature (that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults), we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indispensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain—and one that is not localised and partial only—which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will–power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one–and–twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them–.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known.","I was on the threshold of one of those difficult junctures which most of us encounter several times in our lives; and on each of those different occasions, we do not meet them in the same way, although in the mean time, despite having grown older, we have not altered our character, our nature (which of itself creates not only the loves we experience but almost the women we love, and even their defects). At such moments, our life is divided, as though apportioned in its entirety between the two sides of a pair of scales. On one of the scales lies our wish not to give offence, by appearing too docile, to the woman whom we love, albeit without completely understanding her; but this wish we think it advisable to leave to one side, to prevent her from feeling she is indispensable to us, and thus wearying of our devotion. But on the other lies pain – though not a localized and separate pain – which could be abated only if we were to ignore our desire to be liked, put aside our pretence of being able to live without her, and seek her out. If we lighten the scale containing our pride, by removing from it a little of the will-power which we have been remiss enough to wear away with age, and if we add to the scale containing our unhappiness an acquired physical pain which we have allowed to become worse, it is not the courageous side which outweighs the other, as would have happened at twenty; it is the craven side which, having become too ponderous and lacking a counterweight, unbalances us at fifty. Also, since situations can change as well as repeat themselves, there is the possibility that, by the middle of life or towards the end of it, one’s self-indulgence may have had the unfortunate effect of complicating love with an element of habit, which adolescence, preoccupied by too many other obligations and lacking personal freedom, has not yet acquired."
"Et il ne savait pas si un petit « lever de soleil sur la mer », qu’Elstir lui avait donné, ne valait pas une fortune.","And he didn't know if a little ""sunrise over the sea,"" which Elstir had given him, wasn't worth a fortune.",And he did not know whether a little Sunrise Over the Sea which Elstir had given him might not be worth a fortune.,"And he wondered whether a little Sunrise on the Sea, given to him by Elstir, might not be worth a fortune."
"Quant à ces autres vices auxquels avait fait allusion M. de Norpois, à cet amour à demi incestueux qu’on disait même compliqué d’indélicatesse en matière d’argent, s’ils contredisaient d’une façon choquante la tendance de ses derniers romans, pleins d’un souci si scrupuleux, si douloureux, du bien, que les moindres joies de leurs héros en étaient empoisonnées et que pour le lecteur même il s’en dégageait un sentiment d’angoisse à travers lequel l’existence la plus douce semblait difficile à supporter, ces vices ne prouvaient pas cependant, à supposer qu’on les imputât justement à Bergotte, que sa littérature fût mensongère, et tant de sensibilité, de la comédie. De même qu’en pathologie certains états d’apparence semblable sont dus, les uns à un excès, d’autres à une insuffisance de tension, de sécrétion, etc., de même il peut y avoir vice par hypersensibilité comme il y a vice par manque de sensibilité. Peut-être n’est-ce que dans des vies réellement vicieuses que le problème moral peut se poser avec toute sa force d’anxiété. Et à ce problème l’artiste donne une solution non pas dans le plan de sa vie individuelle, mais de ce qui est pour lui sa vraie vie, une solution générale, littéraire. Comme les grands docteurs de l’Église commencèrent souvent tout en étant bons par connaître les péchés de tous les hommes, et en tirèrent leur sainteté personnelle, souvent les grands artistes tout en étant mauvais se servent de leurs vices pour arriver à concevoir la règle morale de tous. Ce sont les vices (ou seulement les faiblesses et les ridicules) du milieu où ils vivaient, les propos inconséquents, la vie frivole et choquante de leur fille, les trahisons de leur femme ou leurs propres fautes, que les écrivains ont le plus souvent flétries dans leurs diatribes sans changer pour cela le train de leur ménage ou le mauvais ton qui règne dans leur foyer. Mais ce contraste frappait moins autrefois qu’au temps de Bergotte, parce que d’une part, au fur et à mesure que se corrompait la société, les notions de moralité allaient s’épurant, et que d’autre part le public s’était mis au courant plus qu’il n’avait encore fait jusque-là de la vie privée des écrivains ; et certains soirs au théâtre on se montrait l’auteur que j’avais tant admiré à Combray, assis au fond d’une loge dont la seule composition semblait un commentaire singulièrement risible ou poignant, un impudent démenti de la thèse qu’il venait de soutenir dans sa dernière œuvre. Ce n’est pas ce que les uns ou les autres purent me dire qui me renseigna beaucoup sur la bonté ou la méchanceté de Bergotte. Tel de ses proches fournissait des preuves de sa dureté, tel inconnu citait un trait (touchant car il avait été évidemment destiné à rester caché) de sa sensibilité profonde. Il avait agi cruellement avec sa femme. Mais dans une auberge de village où il était venu passer la nuit, il était resté pour veiller une pauvresse qui avait tenté de se jeter à l’eau, et quand il avait été obligé de partir il avait laissé beaucoup d’argent à l’aubergiste pour qu’il ne chassât pas cette malheureuse et pour qu’il eût des attentions envers elle. Peut-être plus le grand écrivain se développa en Bergotte aux dépens de l’homme à barbiche, plus sa vie individuelle se noya dans le flot de toutes les vies qu’il imaginait et ne lui parut plus l’obliger à des devoirs effectifs, lesquels étaient remplacés pour lui par le devoir d’imaginer ces autres vies. Mais en même temps, parce qu’il imaginait les sentiments des autres aussi bien que s’ils avaient été les siens, quand l’occasion faisait qu’il avait à s’adresser à un malheureux, au moins d’une façon passagère, il le faisait en se plaçant non à son point de vue personnel, mais à celui même de l’être qui souffrait, point de vue d’où lui aurait fait horreur le langage de ceux qui continuent à penser à leurs petits intérêts devant la douleur d’autrui. De sorte qu’il a excité autour de lui des rancunes justifiées et des gratitudes ineffaçables.","As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, to that semi-incestuous love which was said to be even complicated with indelicacy in matters of money, if they contradicted in a shocking way the tendency of his last novels , full of so scrupulous, so painful a concern for the good, that the slightest joys of their heroes were poisoned by it and that even for the reader there emanated a feeling of anguish through which the sweetest existence seemed difficult to bear, these vices did not prove, however, supposing that they were justly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was false, and so much sensitivity, comedy. Just as in pathology certain states of similar appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, secretion, etc., so there can be vice by hypersensitivity as there is vice due to lack of sensitivity. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise with all its force of anxiety. And to this problem the artist gives a solution not in the plan of his individual life, but of what is for him his real life, a general, literary solution. As the great doctors of the Church often began while being good by knowing the sins of all men, and drew their personal holiness from it, so often the great artists while being bad use their vices to arrive at the conception of the moral rule. of all. It is the vices (or only the weaknesses and the ridiculousness) of the environment in which they lived, the inconsequential remarks, the frivolous and shocking life of their daughter, the betrayals of their wives or their own faults, that the writers have most often stigmatized. in their diatribes without thereby changing the course of their household or the bad tone which reigns in their home. But this contrast was less striking in the past than in the time of Bergotte, because on the one hand, as society became corrupted, the notions of morality were purified, and because on the other hand the public was made more aware than he had hitherto of the private lives of writers; and on certain evenings at the theater they showed themselves the author whom I had admired so much at Combray, seated at the back of a box whose mere composition seemed to be a singularly laughable or poignant commentary, an impudent denial of the thesis he had just support in his last work. It was not what one or the other could tell me that told me much about Bergotte's goodness or wickedness. One of those close to him provided proof of his harshness, another stranger cited a feature (touching because it had obviously been intended to remain hidden) of his deep sensitivity. He had acted cruelly with his wife. But in a village inn where he had come to spend the night, he had stayed to watch over a poor woman who had tried to jump into the water, and when he had to leave he had left a lot of money in the house. innkeeper so that he would not chase away this unfortunate woman and so that he would pay attention to her. Perhaps the more the great writer developed into Bergotte at the expense of the man with the goatee, the more his individual life drowned in the flood of all the lives he imagined and no longer seemed to him to oblige him to effective duties, which were replaced for him by the duty to imagine these other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as well as if they had been his own, when the occasion brought him to address someone unfortunate, at least in a passing way, he did so by placing himself not from his personal point of view, but from that of the being who was suffering, a point of view from which he would have been horrified by the language of those who continue to think of their petty interests in the face of pain. of others. So that he has excited around him justified grudges and indelible gratitude.","As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play–acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices (or merely the weaknesses and follies) of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte's time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly exalted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon—a brazen–faced denial of—the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance (touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden) of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate (that is to say in a casual encounter) he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another's grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude.","As for the other vices mentioned by M. de Norpois, the semi-incestuous affair, allegedly further complicated by some indelicacy about money, though they did flagrantly contradict the tendency of his latest novels (which were marked by such a painfully scrupulous care for all that is good that their heroes’ slightest joys were poisoned by it, and that even the reader got from it an anguished feeling which made the easiest life seem hard to bear), they did not prove, even if they could be said to be well founded, that his works were a tissue of falsehoods and his great sensitivity mere play-acting. In pathology, certain states of similar appearance may have different causes, some being due to high blood-pressure and others to low, some to an excess of secretion, others to not enough; and in the same way, a single vice can derive either from hypersensivity or from a deficient sensitivity. It may only be in a life deeply steeped in its vice that the moral question can arise with the full power of its anxiety. This question the artist answers not on the plane of his individual life, but in that mode of existence which represents his true life; and there the answer given is a literary one, of general application. Just as the Fathers of the Church, good as they were, first had to practise the sins of all men, through which they found their own sanctity, so great artists, immoral as they are, often derive from their own vices a definition of the moral rule that applies to us all. It is usually on paper that writers inveigh against the vices (or just the foibles and follies) of their own small world, the prattle or scandalous frivolity of their daughters, the treachery of their wives, or even their own failings, while doing nothing to reform these regrettable or unseemly features of their family life. This disparity was once less noticeable than in Bergotte’s day, partly because the drift of society towards its own corruption was matched by a growing refinement of moral ideas, and partly because the reading public had become better informed than before about the private lives of writers; and on certain evenings at the theatre, people would point out the author whom I had so admired in Combray days, sitting back in a box with people whose company, in relation to the idea he had advocated in his latest book, was tantamount to a flippant disclaimer, a singularly derisive or abject disparagement. His goodness or wickedness was never much clarified for me by any of the informants who spoke to me of the man himself. Someone who knew him well would attest to how harsh he could be; someone else would give an instance (touching, because clearly designed to remain a secret) of his deeply sympathetic nature. He had treated his wife callously. But then in a country inn where he was spending the night, he had stayed on so as to look after a poor woman who had tried to drown herself; and when he could stay no longer, he had left a large sum of money so that the landlord would not turn her out, but take care of her. The more the great writer grew in Bergotte at the expense of the man with the goatee, the more his individual life was taken over by all the other lives he imagined, which seemed to relieve him of the obligation of performing real duties, replacing it with the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as vividly as if they had been his own, when circumstances brought him into at least temporary contact with someone much less fortunate than himself, rather than adopt his own point of view, he always put himself in the position of the person who was suffering; and this was a position in which he would have been horrified by the language of people who, when faced with the distress of others, go on being engrossed in their own petty concerns. In this way, he gave grounds for many a justified grudge and for enduring gratitude."
"– Et vous trouvez cela beau ? me demandait-elle, génial comme vous dites ? Je vous dirai que je suis toujours étonnée de voir qu’on prend maintenant au sérieux des choses que les amis de ces messieurs, tout en rendant pleine justice à leurs qualités, étaient les premiers à plaisanter. On ne prodiguait pas le nom de génie comme aujourd’hui, où si vous dites à un écrivain qu’il n’a que du talent il prend cela pour une injure. Vous me citez une grande phrase de M. de Chateaubriand sur le clair de lune. Vous allez voir que j’ai mes raisons pour y être réfractaire. M. de Chateaubriand venait bien souvent chez mon père. Il était du reste agréable quand on était seul parce qu’alors il était simple et amusant, mais dès qu’il y avait du monde, il se mettait à poser et devenait ridicule ; devant mon père, il prétendait avoir jeté sa démission à la face du roi et dirigé le conclave, oubliant que mon père avait été chargé par lui de supplier le roi de le reprendre, et l’avait entendu faire sur l’élection du pape les pronostics les plus insensés. Il fallait entendre sur ce fameux conclave M. de Blacas, qui était un autre homme que M. de Chateaubriand. Quant aux phrases de celui-ci sur le clair de lune elles étaient tout simplement devenues une charge à la maison. Chaque fois qu’il faisait clair de lune autour du château, s’il y avait quelque invité nouveau, on lui conseillait d’emmener M. de Chateaubriand prendre l’air après le dîner. Quand ils revenaient, mon père ne manquait pas de prendre à part l’invité : « M. de Chateaubriand a été bien éloquent ? – Oh ! oui. – Il vous a parlé du clair de lune. – Oui, comment savez-vous ? – Attendez, ne vous a-t-il pas dit, et il lui citait la phrase. – Oui, mais par quel mystère ? – Et il vous a parlé même du clair de lune dans la campagne romaine. – Mais vous êtes sorcier. » Mon père n’était pas sorcier, mais M. de Chateaubriand se contentait de servir toujours un même morceau tout préparé.","- And you find it beautiful? she asked me, brilliant as you say? I will tell you that I am always surprised to see that things are now taken seriously which the friends of these gentlemen, while doing full justice to their qualities, were the first to joke about. We did not lavish the name of genius like today, where if you tell a writer that he has nothing but talent he takes it as an insult. You are quoting me a great sentence of M. de Chateaubriand on moonlight. You will see that I have my reasons for being resistant to it. M. de Chateaubriand often came to see my father. He was pleasant when you were alone because then he was simple and amusing, but as soon as there were people he began to pose and became ridiculous; before my father, he pretended to have thrown his resignation in the king's face and led the conclave, forgetting that my father had been instructed by him to beg the king to take him back, and had heard him make on the election of the pope the wildest predictions. It was necessary to hear on this famous conclave M. de Blacas, who was a different man from M. de Chateaubriand. As for the sentences of this one on the moonlight, they had simply become a load at home. Whenever there was moonlight around the chateau, if there were any new guests, they advised him to take M. de Chateaubriand out for some fresh air after dinner. When they returned, my father did not fail to take the guest aside: “M. de Chateaubriand was very eloquent? - Oh ! Yes. “He told you about the moonlight. - Yes, how do you know? ""Wait,"" he didn't tell you, and he quoted the phrase to her. – Yes, but by what mystery? “And he even told you about the moonlight in the Roman countryside. - But you are a wizard. My father was not a wizard, but M. de Chateaubriand was content to always serve the same ready-made piece.","""And so you think that good, do you?"" she would ask, ""inspired, as you call it. I must confess that I am always surprised to see people taking things seriously nowadays which the friends of those gentlemen, while doing ample justice to their merits, were the first to laugh at. People weren't so free then with the word 'inspired' as they are now, when if you say to a writer that he has mere talent he thinks you're insulting him. You quote me a fine passage from M. de Chateaubriand about moonlight. You shall see that I have my own reasons for being refractory. M. de Chateaubriand used constantly to come to see my father. He was quite a pleasant person when you were alone with him, because then he was simple and amusing, but the moment he had an audience he would begin to pose, and then he became absurd; when my father was in the room, he pretended that he had flung his resignation in the King's face, and that he had controlled the voting in the Conclave, forgetting that it was my father whom he had asked to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had heard him make the most idiotic forecasts of the Papal election. You ought to have heard M. de Blacas on that famous Conclave; he was a very different kind of man from M. de Chateaubriand. As to his fine phrases about the moon, they became part of our regular programme for entertaining our guests. Whenever there was any moonlight about the house, if there was anyone staying with us for the first time he would be told to take M. de Chateaubriand for a stroll after dinner. When they came in, my father would take his guest aside and say: 'Well, and was M. de Chateaubriand very eloquent?'—'Oh, yes.' ' He's been talking about the moon?'—'Yes, how did you know?'—'One moment, didn't he say——' and then my father would quote the passage. ' He did; but how in the world…?'—'And he spoke to you of the moonlight on the Roman Campagna?'—'But, my dear sir, you're a magician.' My father was no magician, but M. de Chateaubriand had the same little speech about the moon which he served up every time.""","‘You like that, do you? she would say. You think it’s “brilliant”, as you say. Let me tell you, I am for ever being surprised to see that people nowadays treat very seriously things which the friends of these writing gentlemen, whose merits they were well aware of, took plenty of pleasure in bantering them for. Words like “brilliant” and “genius” were not bandied about then as they are these days – credit a writer with mere “talent” and he thinks you’re insulting him! I can assure you I have good reason to resist the blandishments of your M. de Chateaubriand – and his moonshine. He was a gentleman who was often in my father’s house. Very pleasant to be with when there was no other company, quite unaffected, an amusing man. But no sooner would other guests come on the scene than he started his ridiculous posturing and showing off – he actually stated that he had tossed his resignation in the King’s face and directed the whole Conclave of Cardinals, forgetting that in fact he had got my father to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had overheard him make the most wildly inaccurate forecasts about the election of the Pope! No, the man to hear on the subject of that Conclave was M. de Blacas, who was more than a cut above your M. de Chateaubriand. And as for his fine phrases on the moonlight, they were one of our family jokes. Why, on nights when there was a full moon, we would take the newest guest aside and suggest he take a turn in the park after dinner with M. de Chateaubriand. Then when they came back in, my father would make a point of murmuring to the new chap, “And was M. de Chateaubriand in fine voice tonight? – Ah, yes! – And did he allude to the moonlight? – Indeed he did, but how did you know? – And did he not say the moon was revealing her old secret of melancholy? – Yes he did! But how on earth –? – And did he not also refer to the moonlight in the Roman countryside? – You’ve got second sight!” Now, of course, my father did not have any such thing, but M. de Chateaubriand was always happy to trot out the same well-rehearsed speech.’"
"D’autre part, le bâtonnier et ses amis ne tarissaient pas de sarcasmes, au sujet d’une vieille dame riche et titrée, parce qu’elle ne se déplaçait qu’avec tout son train de maison. Chaque fois que la femme du notaire et la femme du premier président la voyaient dans la salle à manger au moment des repas, elles l’inspectaient insolemment avec leur face à main du même air minutieux et défiant que si elle avait été quelque plat au nom pompeux mais à l’apparence suspecte qu’après le résultat défavorable d’une observation méthodique on fait éloigner, avec un geste distant et une grimace de dégoût.","On the other hand, the president of the bar and his friends were full of sarcasm about a rich and titled old lady, because she only traveled with her entire household train. Each time the wife of the notary and the wife of the first president saw her in the dining room at mealtimes, they inspected her insolently with their face to hand with the same meticulous and defiant air as if she had been some dish in the name of pompous but with a suspicious appearance who, after the unfavorable result of a methodical observation, is driven away, with a distant gesture and a grimace of disgust.","On the other hand, the barrister and his friends could not exhaust their flow of sarcasm on the subject of a wealthy old lady of title, because she never moved anywhere without taking her whole household with her. Whenever the wives of the solicitor and the magistrate saw her in the dining–room at meal–times they put up their glasses and gave her an insolent scrutiny, as minute and distrustful as if she had been some dish with a pretentious name but a suspicious appearance which, after the negative result of a systematic study, must be sent away with a lofty wave of the hand and a grimace of disgust.","The bâtonnier and his friends also lavished sarcasm on the person of an old lady, rich and titled, because she would never travel without her entire household. Whenever the notary’s wife and the good lady of the First President saw her at meal-times in the dining-room, they would hold up their eye-glasses and give her a good, long, insolent stare, with such an air of punctilious distaste and misgiving that she might have been a dish of pompous name and dubious appearance which, after subjecting it to a rigorous inspection, one waves away with a distant gesture and a grimace of disgust."
"– Je suis si bien près de mon petit papa, je veux rester encore un moment, répondit Gilberte en cachant sa tête sous le bras de son père qui passa tendrement les doigts dans la chevelure blonde.","""I'm so close to my little daddy, I want to stay a while longer,"" replied Gilberte, hiding her head under her father's arm, who ran his fingers tenderly through the blond hair.","""I'm so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,"" replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair.","– But I’m so happy here with my nice old pater. I just want to stay here for a bit longer,’ Gilberte replied, nestling her head into her father’s shoulder, as he combed his fingers through her long fair hair."
"– Non, répondit M. de Norpois avec un sourire, j’avoue que je l’ai délaissé pour une soirée assez différente. J’ai dîné chez une femme dont vous avez peut-être entendu parler, la belle Madame Swann.","“No,” replied M. de Norpois with a smile, “I confess that I left him for a rather different evening. I dined with a woman you may have heard of, the beautiful Madame Swann.","""No,"" M. de Norpois smiled, ""I must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.","– No, smiled M. de Norpois. I must confess I sacrificed that pleasure to a very different way of passing the evening. I dined at the house of a lady of whom you may have heard – the beautiful Madame Swann.’"
"Mais le lendemain matin ! – après qu’un domestique fut venu m’éveiller et m’apporter de l’eau chaude, et pendant que je faisais ma toilette et essayais vainement de trouver les affaires dont j’avais besoin dans ma malle d’où je ne tirais, pêle-mêle, que celles qui ne pouvaient me servir à rien, quelle joie, pensant déjà au plaisir du déjeuner et de la promenade, de voir dans la fenêtre et dans toutes les vitrines des bibliothèques, comme dans les hublots d’une cabine de navire, la mer nue, sans ombrages et pourtant à l’ombre sur une moitié de son étendue que délimitait une ligne mince et mobile, et de suivre des yeux les flots qui s’élançaient l’un après l’autre comme des sauteurs sur un tremplin. À tous moments, tenant à la main la serviette raide et empesée où était écrit le nom de l’hôtel et avec laquelle je faisais d’inutiles efforts pour me sécher, je retournais près de la fenêtre jeter encore un regard sur ce vaste cirque éblouissant et montagneux et sur les sommets neigeux de ses vagues en pierre d’émeraude çà et là polie et translucide, lesquelles avec une placide violence et un froncement léonin laissaient s’accomplir et dévaler l’écoulement de leurs pentes auxquelles le soleil ajoutait un sourire sans visage. Fenêtre à laquelle je devais ensuite me mettre chaque matin comme au carreau d’une diligence dans laquelle on a dormi, pour voir si pendant la nuit s’est rapprochée ou éloignée une chaîne désirée – ici ces collines de la mer qui, avant de revenir vers nous en dansant, peuvent reculer si loin que souvent ce n’était qu’après une longue plaine sablonneuse que j’apercevais à une grande distance leurs premières ondulations, dans un lointain transparent, vaporeux et bleuâtre comme ces glaciers qu’on voit au fond des tableaux des primitifs toscans. D’autres fois, c’était tout près de moi que le soleil riait sur ces flots d’un vert aussi tendre que celui que conserve aux prairies alpestres (dans les montagnes où le soleil s’étale çà et là comme un géant qui en descendrait gaiement, par bonds inégaux, les pentes), moins l’humidité du sol que la liquide mobilité de la lumière. Au reste, dans cette brèche que la plage et les flots pratiquent au milieu du monde pour du reste y faire passer, pour y accumuler la lumière, c’est elle surtout, selon la direction d’où elle vient et que suit notre œil, c’est elle qui déplace et situe les vallonnements de la mer. La diversité de l’éclairage ne modifie pas moins l’orientation d’un lieu, ne dresse pas moins devant nous de nouveaux buts qu’il nous donne le désir d’atteindre, que ne ferait un trajet longuement et effectivement parcouru en voyage. Quand, le matin, le soleil venait de derrière l’hôtel, découvrant devant moi les grèves illuminées jusqu’aux premiers contreforts de la mer, il semblait m’en montrer un autre versant et m’engager à poursuivre, sur la route tournante de ses rayons, un voyage immobile et varié à travers les plus beaux sites du paysage accidenté des heures. Et dès ce premier matin le soleil me désignait au loin, d’un doigt souriant, ces cimes bleues de la mer qui n’ont de nom sur aucune carte géographique, jusqu’à ce qu’étourdi de sa sublime promenade à la surface retentissante et chaotique de leurs crêtes et de leurs avalanches, il vînt se mettre à l’abri du vent dans ma chambre, se prélassant sur le lit défait et égrenant ses richesses sur le lavabo mouillé, dans la malle ouverte, où par sa splendeur même et son luxe déplacé, il ajoutait encore à l’impression du désordre. Hélas, le vent de mer, une heure plus tard, dans la grande salle à manger – tandis que nous déjeunions et que, de la gourde de cuir d’un citron, nous répandions quelques gouttes d’or sur deux soles qui bientôt laissèrent dans nos assiettes le panache de leurs arêtes, frisé comme une plume et sonore comme une cithare – il parut cruel à ma grand’mère de n’en pas sentir le souffle vivifiant à cause du châssis transparent mais clos qui, comme une vitrine, nous séparait de la plage tout en nous la laissant entièrement voir et dans lequel le ciel entrait si complètement que son azur avait l’air d’être la couleur des fenêtres et ses nuages blancs un défaut du verre. Me persuadant que j’étais « assis sur le môle » ou au fond du « boudoir » dont parle Beaudelaire, je me demandais si son « soleil rayonnant sur la mer » ce n’était pas – bien différent du rayon du soir, simple et superficiel comme un trait doré et tremblant – celui qui en ce moment brûlait la mer comme une topaze, la faisait fermenter, devenir blonde et laiteuse comme de la bière, écumante comme du lait, tandis que par moments s’y promenaient çà et là de grandes ombres bleues, que quelque dieu semblait s’amuser à déplacer en bougeant un miroir dans le ciel. Malheureusement ce n’était pas seulement par son aspect que différait de la « salle » de Combray donnant sur les maisons d’en face, cette salle à manger de Balbec, nue, emplie de soleil vert comme l’eau d’une piscine, et à quelques mètres de laquelle la marée pleine et le grand jour élevaient, comme devant la cité céleste, un rempart indestructible et mobile d’émeraude et d’or. À Combray, comme nous étions connus de tout le monde, je ne me souciais de personne. Dans la vie de bains de mer on ne connaît que ses voisins. Je n’étais pas encore assez âgé et j’étais resté trop sensible pour avoir renoncé au désir de plaire aux êtres et de les posséder. Je n’avais pas l’indifférence plus noble qu’aurait éprouvée un homme du monde à l’égard des personnes qui déjeunaient dans la salle à manger, ni des jeunes gens et des jeunes filles passant sur la digue, avec lesquels je souffrais de penser que je ne pourrais pas faire d’excursions, moins pourtant que si ma grand’mère, dédaigneuse des formes mondaines et ne s’occupant que de ma santé, leur avait adressé la demande, humiliante pour moi, de m’agréer comme compagnon de promenade. Soit qu’ils rentrassent vers quelque chalet inconnu, soit qu’ils en sortissent pour se rendre raquette en mains à un terrain de tennis, ou montassent sur des chevaux dont les sabots me piétinaient le cœur, je les regardais avec une curiosité passionnée, dans cet éclairage aveuglant de la plage où les proportions sociales sont changées, je suivais tous leurs mouvements à travers la transparence de cette grande baie vitrée qui laissait passer tant de lumière. Mais elle interceptait le vent et c’était un défaut à l’avis de ma grand’mère qui, ne pouvant supporter l’idée que je perdisse le bénéfice d’une heure d’air, ouvrit subrepticement un carreau et fit envoler du même coup, avec les menus, les journaux, voiles et casquettes de toutes les personnes qui étaient en train de déjeuner ; elle-même, soutenue par le souffle céleste, restait calme et souriante comme sainte Blandine, au milieu des invectives qui, augmentant mon impression d’isolement et de tristesse, réunissaient contre nous les touristes méprisants, dépeignés et furieux.","But the next morning! – after a servant had come to wake me and bring me hot water, and while I was washing and trying in vain to find the things I needed in my trunk from which I was not pulling, pell-mell, than those which could be of no use to me, what joy, already thinking of the pleasure of lunch and of the walk, of seeing in the window and in all the windows of the libraries, as in the portholes of a cabin of ship, the bare sea, without shade and yet in the shade for half of its extent delimited by a thin and mobile line, and to follow with the eyes the waves which rushed one after the other like jumpers on a springboard. At all times, holding in my hand the stiff and starched towel on which was written the name of the hotel and with which I made useless efforts to dry myself, I went back to the window to take another look at this vast dazzling circus. and mountainous and on the snowy summits of its waves of emerald stone here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence and a leonine frown allowed the flow of their slopes to flow and to which the sun added a smile without face. Window at which I then had to stand each morning like the windowpane of a stagecoach in which one slept, to see whether during the night a desired range had come nearer or farther – here these hills of the sea which, before returning dancing towards us, can recede so far that often it was only after a long sandy plain that I saw their first undulations at a great distance, in a transparent distance, vaporous and bluish like those glaciers one sees in the sky. background of paintings of Tuscan primitives. At other times, it was very close to me that the sun laughed on these waves of a green as tender as that preserved in the alpine meadows (in the mountains where the sun spreads out here and there like a giant merrily descending, in unequal leaps, the slopes), less the humidity of the ground than the liquid mobility of light. Moreover, in this breach that the beach and the waves make in the middle of the world in order to pass through it, to accumulate light there, it is above all light, according to the direction from which it comes and which our eye follows, it is she who displaces and situates the undulations of the sea. reach, than would a long and actually traveled journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, discovering in front of me the illuminated shores up to the first foothills of the sea, it seemed to show me another side and commit me to continue, on the winding road of its rays, a motionless and varied journey through the most beautiful sites of the rugged landscape of the hours. And from that first morning the sun pointed out to me in the distance, with a smiling finger, these blue peaks of the sea which have no name on any geographical map, until I was stunned by its sublime promenade on the resounding surface and chaotic with their crests and their avalanches, he came to take shelter from the wind in my room, basking on the unmade bed and shelling out his riches on the wet sink, in the open trunk, where by his very splendor and his luxury displaced, he still added to the impression of disorder. Alas, the sea wind, an hour later, in the large dining room - while we were having lunch and, from the leather gourd of a lemon, we sprinkled a few drops of gold on two soles which soon left in our plates the panache of their edges, curled like a feather and resonant like a zither - it seemed cruel to my grandmother not to feel the invigorating breath of them because of the transparent but closed frame which, like a shop window, separated us of the beach while letting us see it entirely and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure seemed to be the color of the windows and its white clouds a defect of the glass. Persuading myself that I was ""sitting on the mole"" or at the end of the ""boudoir"" of which Beaudelaire speaks, I wondered if his ""beaming sun on the sea"" was not - very different from the evening ray, simple and superficial as a golden and quivering line – the one who at this moment was burning the sea like a topaz, making it ferment, turning blond and milky like beer, foaming like milk, while at times great blue shadows, which some god seemed to have fun moving by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately it was not only in its aspect that differed from the ""room"" of Combray overlooking the houses opposite, this dining room of Balbec, bare, filled with green sun like the water of a swimming pool, and a few yards from which the full tide and broad daylight raised, as before the celestial city, an indestructible and mobile rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, as we were known to everyone, I didn't care about anyone. In seaside life, you only know your neighbours. I was not yet old enough and I had remained too sensitive to have renounced the desire to please beings and to possess them. I did not have the nobler indifference that a man of the world would have felt towards the people who lunched in the dining room, nor the young men and young girls passing on the dyke, with whom I suffered from to think that I could not go on excursions, less nevertheless than if my grandmother, disdainful of worldly forms and concerned only with my health, had addressed to them the request, humiliating for me, to accept me as a companion. of walk. Whether they were going back to some unknown chalet, or coming out of it to go racket in hand to a tennis court, or riding on horses whose hooves trampled my heart, I watched them with passionate curiosity, in this blinding lighting of the beach where social proportions are changed, I followed all their movements through the transparency of this large bay window which let in so much light. But it intercepted the wind and it was a defect in the opinion of my grandmother who, unable to bear the idea that I was losing the benefit of an hour of air, surreptitiously opened a window and sent the same suddenly, with the menus, newspapers, veils and caps of all the people who were having lunch; she herself, supported by the celestial breath, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandine, in the midst of the invectives which, increasing my impression of isolation and sadness, united against us the scornful, disheveled and furious tourists.","But next morning!—after a servant had come to call me, and had brought me hot water, and while I was washing and dressing myself and trying in vain to find the things that I wanted in my trunk, from which I extracted, pell–mell, only a lot of things that were of no use whatever, what a joy it was to me, thinking already of the delights of luncheon and of a walk along the shore, to see in the window, and in all the glass fronts of the bookcases as in the portholes of a ship's cabin, the open sea, naked, unshadowed, and yet with half of its expanse in shadow, bounded by a thin and fluctuant line, and to follow with my eyes the waves that came leaping towards me, one behind another, like divers along a springboard. Every other moment, holding in one hand the starched, unyielding towel, with the name of the hotel printed upon it, with which I was making futile efforts to dry myself, I returned to the window to gaze once more upon that vast amphitheatre, dazzling, mountainous, and upon the snowy crests of its emerald waves, here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence, a leonine bending of the brows, let their steep fronts, to which the sun now added a smile without face or features, run forward to their goal, totter and melt and be no more. Window in which I was, henceforward, to plant myself every morning, as at the pane of a mail coach in which one has slept, to see whether, in the night, a long sought mountain–chain has come nearer or withdrawn—only here it was those hills of the sea which, before they come dancing back towards us, are apt to retire so far that often it was only at the end of a long and sandy plain that I would distinguish, miles it seemed away, their first undulations upon a background transparent, vaporous, bluish, like the glaciers that one sees in the backgrounds of the Tuscan Primitives. On other mornings it was quite close at hand that the sun was smiling upon those waters of a green as tender as that preserved in Alpine pastures (among mountains on which the sun spreads himself here and there like a lazy giant who may at any moment come leaping gaily down their craggy sides) less by the moisture of their soil than by the liquid mobility of their light. Anyhow, in that breach which shore and water between them drive through all the rest of the world, for the passage, the accumulation there of light, it is light above all, according to the direction from which it comes and along which our eyes follow it, it is light that shifts and fixes the undulations of the sea. Difference of lighting modifies no less the orientation of a place, constructs no less before our eyes new goals which it inspires in us the yearning to attain, than would a distance in space actually traversed in the course of a long journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, disclosing to me the sands bathed in light as far as the first bastions of the sea, it seemed to be shewing me another side of the picture, and to be engaging me in the pursuit, along the winding path of its rays, of a journey motionless but ever varied amid all the fairest scenes of the diversified landscape of the hours. And on this first morning the sun pointed out to me far off with a jovial finger those blue peaks of the sea, which bear no name upon any geographer's chart, until, dizzy with its sublime excursion over the thundering and chaotic surface of their crests and avalanches, it came back to take shelter from the wind in my bedroom, swaggering across the unmade bed and scattering its riches over the splashed surface of the basin–stand, and into my open trunk, where by its very splendour and ill–matched luxury it added still further to the general effect of disorder. Alas, that wind from the sea; an hour later, in the great dining–room—while we were having our luncheon, and from the leathern gourd of a lemon were sprinkling a few golden drops on to a pair of soles which presently left on our plates the plumes of their picked skeletons, curled like stiff feathers and resonant as citherns,—it seemed to my grandmother a cruel deprivation not to be able to feel its life–giving breath on her cheek, on account of the window, transparent but closed, which like the front of a glass case in a museum divided us from the beach while allowing us to look out upon its whole extent, and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure had the effect of being the colour of the windows and its white clouds only so many flaws in the glass. Imagining that I was 'seated upon the mole' or at rest in the 'boudoir' of which Baudelaire speaks I asked myself whether his 'Sun's rays upon the sea' were not—a very different thing from the evening ray, simple and superficial as the wavering stroke of a golden pencil—just what at that moment was scorching the sea topaz–brown, fermenting it, turning it pale and milky like foaming beer, like milk, while now and then there hovered over it great blue shadows which some god seemed, for his pastime, to be shifting to and fro by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately, it was not only in its outlook that it differed from our room at Combray, giving upon the houses over the way, this dining–room at Balbec, bare–walled, filled with a sunlight green as the water in a marble font, while a few feet away the full tide and broad daylight erected as though before the gates of the heavenly city an indestructible and moving rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, since we were known to everyone, I took heed of no one. In life at the seaside one knows only one's own party. I was not yet old enough, I was still too sensitive to have outgrown the desire to find favour in the sight of other people and to possess their hearts. Nor had I acquired the more noble indifference which a man of the world would have felt, with regard to the people who were eating their luncheon in the room, nor to the boys and girls who strolled past the window, with whom I was pained by the thought that I should never be allowed to go on expeditions, though not so much pained as if my grandmother, contemptuous of social formalities and concerned about nothing but my health, had gone to them with the request, humiliating for me to overhear, that they would consent to let me accompany them. Whether they were returning to some villa beyond my ken, or had emerged from it, racquet in hand, on their way to some lawn–tennis court, or were mounted on horses whose hooves trampled and tore my heart, I gazed at them with a passionate curiosity, in that blinding light of the beach by which social distinctions are altered, I followed all their movements through the transparency of that great bay of glass which allowed so much light to flood the room. But it intercepted the wind, and this seemed wrong to my grandmother, who, unable to endure the thought that I was losing the benefit of an hour in the open air, surreptitiously unlatched a pane and at once set flying, with the bills of fare, the newspapers, veils and hats of all the people at the other tables; she herself, fortified by the breath of heaven, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandina, amid the torrent of invective which, increasing my sense of isolation and misery, those scornful, dishevelled, furious visitors combined to pour on us.","But what delight there was the following morning! After a servant had come to waken me and bring hot water, and while I washed and vainly rummaged in my trunk for necessary things, pulling out a jumble of unnecessary ones, how exhilarating it was, amid pleasant prospects of breakfast and a walk, to see not only the window but all the glass doors of the bookcases, as though they were the portholes of a ship’s cabin, filled by the open sea, which showed no dark designs towards me (though half of its expanse was actually darkened by a shadow, marked off from the rest of it by a thin shifting frontier), and to gaze at the long rollers which came plunging in, one after the other, like divers from a board! Holding the stiff, starched towel inscribed with the name of the hotel, with which I was making unavailing efforts to dry myself, I kept going back to the window to look again at the huge, dazzling amphitheatre, mountainous with the snowy peaks of its breakers of emerald, here and there polished and translucent, which with placid violence let their beetling, lionlike crags and towering slopes topple into avalanches and collapse upon themselves under the faceless smile of the sun. Every morning from then on, that window was where I posted myself, as though leaning out at the door of an overnight coach to see whether a range of hills that one longs to reach has come closer or receded during the hours of darkness – for the hills of the sea, before they come dancing back towards us, can retreat so far that often it was only at a distance, beyond a great stretch of sandy plain, that I caught sight of their closest undulations, in a transparent, vaporous, bluish remoteness calling to mind those glaciers one sees in the backgrounds of paintings by Tuscan primitives. On other days, the waves would be very near; and the sunlight laughed on a green which was as soft as the green brought out in Alpine meadows (among mountains where the sun sprawls about like a reckless giant blithely tumbling downhill) not so much by the moistness of the ground as by the liquid mobility of the light. Moreover, in that breach that a beach and its waves make in the rest of the world, so as to let the light flood in, it is especially the light, according to the direction it shines from and the point of view it thereby gives to the eye, which makes for the placement and displacement of a seascape’s hills and dales. Variations in lighting can alter the outlook of a place, can bring before us new goals and give us the desire to attain them, no less effectively than can the laborious making of a long journey. In the mornings, when the sunlight came from behind the hotel, baring the illuminated sands for me all the way to the sea’s first foothills, it appeared to be showing me a concealed slope of them and to be urging me to undertake a varied though stationary tour, by way of the turning road of its rays, through the most impressive sites of the hours’ changing landscape. On the very first morning, the sun kept smiling and pointing out to me the sea’s distant blue summits, named on no map, until its sublime transit of the resounding chaos of their cliffs and avalanches brought it dazzled into my room, out of the wind, to lie about on the unmade bed and strew its wealth on the wet wash-stand, in my opened trunk, its very splendour and incongruous extravagance increasing the effect of untidiness. Unfortunately, my grandmother’s opinion of the sea-breeze, an hour later, as we had lunch in the large dining-room – sprinkling from a lemon’s leather gourd a few golden drops on a brace of sole, which soon left on our plates the plume of their skeletons, as fragile as a feather and as resonant as a zither – was that it was a shame not to feel its bracing effects, of which we were deprived by a screen which, transparent but closed, made the beach look like an exhibit behind plate-glass, exposing it completely to our view but separating us from it, while the sky seemed so much a part of the room that its blue appeared to be the colour of the panes and the white of the clouds looked like flaws in the glass. Fancying that Baudelaire ’s lines about ‘lounging on the esplanade’ or ‘in the boudoir’ applied to me, I was wondering whether his ‘sunbeams gleaming on the sea’ – unlike the evening sunbeam, simple and shallow, a tremulous golden shaft – might not be those I could see at that very moment burnishing the surface of the waves to topaz, fermenting it to a pale milky beer, frothing it like milk, while every now and then great blue shadows passed over parts of it, as though high above us a god was having fun moving a mirror about. Compared to the ‘parlour’ at Combray, looking out on the houses opposite, its aspect was not, alas, the only way in which this dining-room in Balbec differed, with its great bare emptiness filled to the brim by sunshine as green as water in a swimming-pool, and with the high tide and broad daylight only a few feet away, as though guarding the celestial city with their indestructible moving barrier of emerald and gold. In Combray, where we were known by everybody, I paid attention to no one. But on holiday at the seaside, one is surrounded by strangers. I was not yet old enough, and had remained too sensitive, to have given up the wish to please others and to possess them. I had none of the dignified indifference that a man of the world would have felt towards the people lunching in that dining-room or the young men and girls walking past on the esplanade: it was galling to think I could go on none of their outings – though less galling than if my grandmother, in her disdain for polite convention and her concern for my well-being, had humiliated me by asking them whether I might not join them! Whether they were wandering back to some holiday house unknown to me, strolling out to tennis carrying racquets, or riding past on horses whose hooves trampled my heart, I sat gazing at them with passionate curiosity, as they dawdled in that seaside dazzle which alters social dimensions, watching their every move through the transparency of the grand glassed-in bay that let in so much light. However, it also kept the breeze out; and that was a shortcoming in my grandmother’s estimation , she finding it intolerable that I should lose the benefit of a single hour of fresh air. So she surreptitiously opened one of the windows, which had the effect of blowing away the menus, newspapers, veils and caps of the other people having lunch, while she herself, invigorated by the bracing breath from heaven, was as unruffled and full of smiles as Saint Blandine,14 braving the abuse which increased my feelings of aloneness and dejection and united the other guests against us in contempt, outrage and dishevelment."
"Mais si elle était restée toute la matinée chez elle, quand elle arrivait dans le salon, c’était vêtue d’un peignoir en crêpe de Chine de couleur claire qui me semblait plus élégant que toutes les robes.","But if she had stayed all morning at home, when she arrived in the living room, it was dressed in a light-colored crepe de chine peignoir which seemed to me more elegant than all the dresses.","But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing–room she would be clad in a wrapper of crêpe–de–Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses.","However, if she had spent all morning at home, she would come into the drawing-room wearing a tea-gown in a light shade of crêpe de Chine, which to my eye was more sophisticated than any evening gown."
"Pour la première fois je sentais qu’il était possible que ma mère vécût sans moi, autrement que pour moi, d’une autre vie. Elle allait habiter de son côté avec mon père à qui peut-être elle trouvait que ma mauvaise santé, ma nervosité, rendaient l’existence un peu compliquée et triste. Cette séparation me désolait davantage parce que je me disais qu’elle était probablement pour ma mère le terme des déceptions successives que je lui avais causées, qu’elle m’avait tues et après lesquelles elle avait compris la difficulté de vacances communes ; et peut-être aussi le premier essai d’une existence à laquelle elle commençait à se résigner pour l’avenir, au fur et à mesure que les années viendraient pour mon père et pour elle, d’une existence où je la verrais moins, où, ce qui même dans mes cauchemars ne m’était jamais apparu, elle serait déjà pour moi un peu étrangère, une dame qu’on verrait rentrer seule dans une maison où je ne serais pas, demandant au concierge s’il n’y avait pas de lettres de moi.","For the first time I felt that it was possible for my mother to live without me, other than for me, in another life. She was going to live on her side with my father, to whom perhaps she found that my poor health, my nervousness, made life a little complicated and sad. This separation saddened me more because I said to myself that it was probably for my mother the end of the successive disappointments that I had caused her, that she had killed me and after which she had understood the difficulty of vacations together; and perhaps also the first attempt at an existence to which she was beginning to resign herself for the future, as the years would come for my father and for her, of an existence where I would see her less, where, which even in my nightmares had never occurred to me, she would already be a bit foreign to me, a lady who would be seen going alone into a house where I would not be, asking the concierge if there had no letters from me.","For the first time I began to feel that it was possible that my mother might live without me, otherwise than for me, a separate life. She was going to stay with my father, whose existence it may have seemed to her that my feeble health, my nervous excitability complicated somewhat and saddened. This separation made me all the more wretched because I told myself that it probably marked for my mother an end of the successive disappointments which I had caused her, of which she had never said a word to me but which had made her realise the difficulty of our taking our holidays together; and perhaps also the first trial of a form of existence to which she was beginning, now, to resign herself for the future, as the years crept on for my father and herself, an existence in which I should see less of her, in which (a thing that not even in my nightmares had yet been revealed to me) she would already have become something of a stranger, a lady who might be seen going home by herself to a house in which I should not be, asking the porter whether there was not a letter for her from me.","I was beginning to realize for the first time that it was possible for my mother to live without me, to live for reasons unrelated to me, to lead a life of her own. She was going to live for herself, with my father, who she may have thought deserved a simpler and more enjoyable life than my ill-health and nervous disposition allowed him. This separation from her saddened me even more, as I told myself that she very likely saw it as a welcome pause in the succession of disappointments I had brought upon her, which she had never spoken of but which must have made her see the prospect of spending the holidays with me as irksome; very likely she even saw it as a first experimental step towards the future life to which she would have to resign herself, as she and my father advanced in years, in which I would see less of her, in which – and this I had never glimpsed in my worst nightmares – she would become something of a stranger to me, a lady to be seen going home alone to a house where I did not live and where she would ask the concierge whether there was not a letter from me."
"– Eh bien, il y a qu’une femme aux cheveux jaunes, avec un pied de rouge sur la figure, une voiture qui sentait l’horizontale d’une lieue, et comme n’en ont que ces demoiselles, est venue tantôt pour voir la prétendue marquise.","“Well, there is only a woman with yellow hair, with a foot of rouge on her face, a car which smells of the horizontal of a league, and as only these young ladies have, came a while ago to see the alleged Marquise.","""Just listen to this. A woman with yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage like a—you could smell it a mile off; which only a creature like that would dare to have—came here to–day to call on the Marquise, by way of!""","Just a female with dyed hair, if you don’t mind, made-up to the eyeballs, and with a carriage that smacked of ‘immoral earnings’ a mile away, the kind that sort of woman always has, and who turned up a while ago asking to see our alleged marquise!"
"Maintenant, leurs traits charmants n’étaient plus indistincts et mêlés. Je les avais répartis et agglomérés (à défaut du nom de chacune, que j’ignorais) autour de la grande qui avait sauté par dessus le vieux banquier ; de la petite qui détachait sur l’horizon de la mer ses joues bouffies et roses, ses yeux verts ; de celle au teint bruni, au nez droit, qui tranchait au milieu des autres ; d’une autre, au visage blanc comme un œuf dans lequel un petit nez faisait un arc de cercle comme un bec de poussin, visage comme en ont certains très jeunes gens ; d’une autre encore, grande, couverte d’une pèlerine (qui lui donnait un aspect si pauvre et démentait tellement sa tournure élégante que l’explication qui se présentait à l’esprit était que cette jeune fille devait avoir des parents assez brillants et plaçant leur amour-propre assez au-dessus des baigneurs de Balbec et de l’élégance vestimentaire de leurs propres enfants pour qu’il leur fût absolument égal de la laisser se promener sur la digue dans une tenue que de petites gens eussent jugée trop modeste) ; d’une fille aux yeux brillants, rieurs, aux grosses joues mates, sous un « polo » noir, enfoncé sur sa tête, qui poussait une bicyclette avec un dandinement de hanches si dégingandé, en employant des termes d’argot si voyous et criés si fort, quand je passai auprès d’elle (parmi lesquels je distinguai cependant la phrase fâcheuse de « vivre sa vie ») qu’abandonnant l’hypothèse que la pèlerine de sa camarade m’avait fait échafauder, je conclus plutôt que toutes ces filles appartenaient à la population qui fréquente les vélodromes, et devaient être les très jeunes maîtresses de coureurs cyclistes. En tous cas, dans aucune de mes suppositions, ne figurait celle qu’elles eussent pu être vertueuses. À première vue – dans la manière dont elles se regardaient en riant, dans le regard insistant de celle aux joues mates – j’avais compris qu’elles ne l’étaient pas. D’ailleurs, ma grand-mère avait toujours veillé sur moi avec une délicatesse trop timorée pour que je ne crusse pas que l’ensemble des choses qu’on ne doit pas faire est indivisible et que des jeunes filles qui manquent de respect à la vieillesse fussent tout d’un coup arrêtées par des scrupules quand il s’agit de plaisirs plus tentateurs que de sauter par-dessus un octogénaire.","Now their charming features were no longer indistinct and intertwined. I had distributed them and clustered them (for lack of the name of each one, which I did not know) around the tall one who had jumped over the old banker; of the little one who stood out against the horizon of the sea with her puffy, rosy cheeks, her green eyes; of the one with the tanned complexion, the straight nose, which stood out among the others; another, with a white face like an egg in which a small nose made an arc of a circle like the beak of a chick, a face such as some very young people have; another, tall, covered with a cape (which made her look so poor and belied her elegant bearing so much that the explanation that came to mind was that this young girl must have had parents who were quite brilliant and placing their pride enough above the bathers of Balbec and the dress elegance of their own children so that it was absolutely the same for them to let her walk on the dyke in an outfit that ordinary people would have considered too modest ); of a girl with bright, laughing eyes, with big dull cheeks, in a black ""polo shirt"", pulled down on her head, who pushed a bicycle with such a lanky waddling of her hips, using such hooligan and shouted slang terms so strongly, when I passed by her (among whom I nevertheless distinguished the unfortunate phrase of ""live one's life"") that, abandoning the hypothesis that her comrade's cloak had made me construct, I concluded rather that all these girls belonged to the population that frequents velodromes, and must have been the very young mistresses of cyclists. In any case, in none of my suppositions figured that they could have been virtuous. At first glance – in the way they looked at each other laughing, in the insistent gaze of the one with the dark cheeks – I knew they weren't. Moreover, my grandmother had always watched over me with too timorous a delicacy for me not to believe that all the things one should not do are indivisible and that young girls who lack respect for old age were suddenly stopped by scruples when it comes to more tempting pleasures than jumping over an octogenarian.","By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken's beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape (which gave her so poverty–stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self–esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the 'front' dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest); a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo–cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating 'live my own life') that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend's hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing–tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight—in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks—I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian.","By now, their charm was not blended into undifferentiated features. I could separate these from one another and apportion them to individual girls (in lieu of their names, which I had no knowledge of), such as the tall one who had jumped over the old banker; the small one who set off her plump pink cheeks and her green eyes against the horizon of the sea; the one whose darker colouring and straight nose made her look so different from the others; another one with a face as white as an egg, on which a little nose, like a chick’s beak, drew an arc of a circle, a face reminiscent of some very young men’s; the other one who was tall and wearing a hooded cape, which made her look so poor, and was in such contrast with the rest of her elegant outfit that my idea of her was that she must have parents whose brilliance and pride-in-self, drawn from things well above the heads of Balbec and its bathers, things utterly divorced from considerations of the elegance or otherwise or their own offspring, enabled them to be totally indifferent to the fact that this daughter of theirs went walking along the esplanade wearing something that people of the lower classes would have deemed too unprepossessing; a girl with shining, laughing eyes and full, matt-complexioned cheeks, a little black toque pulled right down, who was pushing a bicycle along and swinging her hips so freely, while using slang words which were so strong, and which she shouted out so loud as I passed close by (among which I distinctly heard the unladylike expression ‘She’s no better than she should be’), that I had to replace the hypothesis I had built on the hood and cape of her friend by another more plausible one: every one of these girls belonged to the crowds who frequent velodromes, and must be the extremely youthful girl-friends of racing cyclists. Certainly, in none of my conjectures did I entertain the possibility that they might be chaste. I had known as much at a glance: I saw it in the way they kept exchanging looks and laughs, and in the insistent stare of the one with the cheeks and the matt complexion. Moreover, my grandmother’s concern for me had always been so over-scrupulous that I had come to believe that the things one must not do are a single indivisible set, and that young girls who are prepared to be rude to old age might well have few qualms about infringing other prohibitions, in which the pleasures to be enjoyed are more tempting than just jumping over an octogenarian."

"L’effort qu’Elstir faisait pour se dépouiller en présence de la réalité de toutes les notions de son intelligence était d’autant plus admirable que cet homme qui, avant de peindre, se faisait ignorant, oubliait tout par probité, car ce qu’on sait n’est pas à soi, avait justement une intelligence exceptionnellement cultivée. Comme je lui avouais la déception que j’avais eue devant l’église de Balbec : « Comment, me dit-il, vous avez été déçu par ce porche ? mais c’est la plus belle Bible historiée que le peuple ait jamais pu lire.

As I confessed to him the disappointment I had had in front of the church of Balbec: “How, he said to me, were you disappointed by this porch? but it is the most beautiful story Bible that the people have ever been able to read. This Virgin and all the bas-reliefs that tell of her life are the most tender, most inspired expression of this long poem of adoration and praise that the Middle Ages will unfold to the glory of the Madonna.

When I confessed to him the disappointment that I had felt upon seeing the porch at Balbec: ""What!"" he had exclaimed, ""you were disappointed by the porch! Why, it's the finest illustrated Bible that the people have ever had. That Virgin, and all the bas–reliefs telling the story of her life, they are the most loving, the most inspired expression of that endless poem of adoration and praise in which the middle ages extolled the glory of the Madonna. If you only knew, side by side with the most scrupulous accuracy in rendering the sacred text, what exquisite ideas the old carver had, what profound thoughts, what delicious poetry!","The effort made by Elstir, when seeing reality, to rid himself of all the ideas the mind contains, to make himself ignorant so as to paint, to forget everything for the sake of his own integrity (since the things one knows are not one’s own), was especially admirable in a man whose own mind was exceptionally cultivated. When I told him of my disappointment on seeing the church of Balbec, he said, ‘What’s that? Disappointed by that porch! Why, it’s the finest collection of Bible stories that the faithful could ever have had. That Virgin, and all those low-reliefs telling her life-story, make up the most tender and inspired expression of the long poem of adoration and praise which the Middle Ages dedicated to the glory of the Madonna. If you only realized, not just the closeness and fidelity to the sacred text, but the old sculptor’s touches of genius, the profundity of some of his ideas, the delicacy and poetry of the thing!"
"N’importe, Andrée, comme Rosemonde et Gisèle, même plus qu’elles, était tout de même une amie d’Albertine, partageant sa vie, imitant ses façons au point que le premier jour je ne les avais pas distinguées d’abord l’une de l’autre. Entre ces jeunes filles, tiges de roses dont le principal charme était de se détacher sur la mer, régnait la même indivision qu’au temps où je ne les connaissais pas et où l’apparition de n’importe laquelle me causait tant d’émotion, en m’annonçant que la petite bande n’était pas loin. Maintenant encore la vue de l’une me donnait un plaisir où entrait, dans une proportion que je n’aurais pas su dire, de voir les autres la suivre plus tard, et, même si elles ne venaient pas ce jour-là, de parler d’elles et de savoir qu’il leur serait dit que j’étais allé sur la plage.","Never mind, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, even more than them, was all the same a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her ways to the point that the first day I hadn't distinguished them at first. each other. Between these young girls, stems of roses whose main charm was to stand out against the sea, reigned the same indivision as when I did not know them and when the appearance of any one caused me so much emotion. , telling me that the little band was not far away. Even now the sight of one gave me a pleasure into which entered, in a proportion that I could not have known, to see the others follow her later, and, even if they did not come that day, to talking about them and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach.","No matter, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, indeed more than they, was, when all was said, a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her conduct, so closely that, the first day, I had not at once distinguished them one from another. Over these girls, flowering sprays of roses whose principal charm was that they outlined themselves against the sea, the same undivided partnership prevailed as at the time when I did not know them, when the appearance of no matter which of them had caused me such violent emotion by its announcement that the little band was not far off. And even now the sight of one of them filled me with a pleasure into which there entered, to an extent which I should not have found it easy to define, the thought of seeing the others follow her in due course, and even if they did not come that day, speaking about them, and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach.","However, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, and even more than they, was a friend of Albertine’s, sharing her life, and imitating her ways so much that, at my first sight of them, I had been unable to tell which of them was which. My bevy of girls, like long-stemmed roses, whose main charm was that they stood against the blue background of the sea, was as indivisible now as in the days when its members were strangers to me, when any one of them only had to appear, for me to be seized by the thrilling expectation that the whole group must soon come and join her. A moment with one of them could still give me a pleasure which was indefinably mingled with the joy of knowing that the others would be along soon; and, even if they did not turn up that same day, I had the joy of talking with her about them, and of being sure they would be told I had been down to the beach."

"Elle entr’ouvrait les persiennes ; à l’annexe en saillie de l’hôtel, le soleil était déjà installé sur les toits comme un couvreur matinal qui commence tôt son ouvrage et l’accomplit en silence pour ne pas réveiller la ville qui dort encore et de laquelle l’immobilité le fait paraître plus agile. Elle me disait l’heure, le temps qu’il ferait, que ce n’était pas la peine que j’allasse jusqu’à la fenêtre, qu’il y avait de la brume sur la mer, si la boulangerie était déjà ouverte, quelle était cette voiture qu’on entendait : tout cet insignifiant lever de rideau, ce négligeable introït du jour auquel personne n’assiste, petit morceau de vie qui n’était qu’à nous deux, que j’évoquerais volontiers dans la journée devant Françoise ou des étrangers en parlant du brouillard à couper au couteau qu’il y avait eu le matin à six heures, avec l’ostentation non d’un savoir acquis, mais d’une marque d’affection reçue par moi seul ; doux instant matinal qui s’ouvrait comme une symphonie par le dialogue rythmé de mes trois coups auquel la cloison pénétrée de tendresse et de joie, devenue harmonieuse, immatérielle, chantant comme les anges, répondait par trois autres coups, ardemment attendus, deux fois répétés, et où elle savait transporter l’âme de ma grand’mère tout entière et la promesse de sa venue, avec une allégresse d’annonciation et une fidélité musicale. Mais cette première nuit d’arrivée, quand ma grand’mère m’eût quitté, je recommençai à souffrir, comme j’avais déjà souffert à Paris au moment de quitter la maison. Peut-être cet effroi que j’avais – qu’ont tant d’autres – de coucher dans une chambre inconnue, peut-être cet effroi n’est-il que la forme la plus humble, obscure, organique, presque inconsciente, de ce grand refus désespéré qu’opposent les choses qui constituent le meilleur de notre vie présente à ce que nous revêtions mentalement de notre acceptation la formule d’un avenir où elles ne figurent pas ; refus qui était au fond de l’horreur que m’avait fait si souvent éprouver la pensée que mes parents mourraient un jour, que les nécessités de la vie pourraient m’obliger à vivre loin de Gilberte, ou simplement à me fixer définitivement dans un pays où je ne reverrais plus jamais mes amis ; refus qui était encore au fond de la difficulté que j’avais à penser à ma propre mort ou à une survie comme celle que Bergotte promettait aux hommes dans ses livres, dans laquelle je ne pourrais emporter mes souvenirs, mes défauts, mon caractère qui ne se résignaient pas à l’idée de ne plus être et ne voulaient pour moi ni du néant, ni d’une éternité où ils ne seraient plus.","She half-opened the shutters; in the projecting annex of the hotel, the sun was already installed on the roofs like a morning roofer who begins his work early and accomplishes it in silence so as not to wake the city which is still sleeping and whose immobility the makes it look more nimble. She told me the time, the weather, that it was not worth going to the window, that there was mist on the sea, if the bakery was already open , what was this car that we heard: all this insignificant raising of the curtain, this negligible introit of the day which no one attends, little piece of life which was only ours, which I would gladly evoke during the day in front of Françoise or strangers, talking about the fog that had been cut through with a knife that morning at six o'clock, with the ostentation not of acquired knowledge, but of a mark of affection received by me alone; sweet morning moment which opened like a symphony through the rhythmic dialogue of my three knocks to which the partition penetrated with tenderness and joy, become harmonious, immaterial, singing like the angels, responded with three other knocks, ardently awaited, twice repeated , and where she knew how to convey the soul of my grandmother in its entirety and the promise of her coming, with an announcing joy and musical fidelity. But that first night of my arrival, when my grandmother had left me, I began to suffer again, as I had already suffered in Paris when leaving the house. Perhaps this dread I had - which so many others have - of sleeping in an unfamiliar room, perhaps this dread is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great desperate refusal of the things which constitute the best of our present life to our mentally clothing with our acceptance the formula of a future in which they do not appear; a refusal which was at the bottom of the horror I had so often felt at the thought that my parents would die one day, that the necessities of life might oblige me to live far from Gilberte, or simply to settle down definitively in a country where I would never see my friends again; refusal which was still at the bottom of the difficulty which I had to think of my own death or of a survival like that which Bergotte promised to the men in his books, in which I could not carry my memories, my faults, my character which does not didn't resign themselves to the idea of no longer being and didn't want for me either nothingness, or an eternity where they would no longer be.","She pushed open the shutters; where a wing of the hotel jutted out at right angles to my window, the sun was already installed upon the roof, like a slater who is up betimes, and starts early and works quietly so as not to rouse the sleeping town, whose stillness seems to enhance his activity. She told me what o'clock, what sort of day it was; that it was not worth while my getting up and coming to the window, that there was a mist over the sea; if the baker's shop had opened yet; what the vehicle was that I could hear passing. All that brief, trivial curtain–raiser, that negligible introit of a new day, performed without any spectator, a little scrap of life which was only for our two selves, which I should have no hesitation in repeating, later on, to Françoise or even to strangers, speaking of the fog 'which you could have cut with a knife at six o'clock that morning, with the ostentation of one who was boasting not of a piece of knowledge that he had acquired but of a mark of affection shewn to himself alone; dear morning moment, opened like a symphony by the rhythmical dialogue of my three taps, to which the thin wall of my bedroom, steeped in love and joy, grown melodious, immaterial, singing like the angelic choir, responded with three other taps, eagerly awaited, repeated once and again, in which it contrived to waft to me the soul of my grandmother, whole and perfect, and the promise of her coming, with a swiftness of annunciation and melodic accuracy. But on this first night after our arrival, when my grandmother had left me, I began again to feel as I had felt, the day before, in Paris, at the moment of leaving home. Perhaps this fear that I had—and shared with so many of my fellow–men—of sleeping in a strange room, perhaps this fear is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great and desperate resistance set up by the things that constitute the better part of our present life towards our mentally assuming, by accepting it as true, the formula of a future in which those things are to have no part; a resistance which was at the root of the horror that I had so often been made to feel by the thought that my parents must, one day, die, that the stern necessity of life might oblige me to live remote from Gilberte, or simply to settle permanently in a place where I should never see any of my old friends; a resistance which was also at the root of the difficulty that I found in imagining my own death, or a survival such as Bergotte used to promise to mankind in his books, a survival in which I should not be allowed to take with me my memories, my frailties, my character, which did not easily resign themselves to the idea of ceasing to be, and desired for me neither annihilation nor an eternity in which they would have no part.","When she parted the blinds, the sun would be already up, on the roofs of the protruding annexe of the hotel, like a slater on the early shift, working in silence so as not to wake the sleeping town, which in its inactivity makes him appear all the more nimble. She would tell me what time it was, what the weather would be like that day, that I need not get up and go to the window, that there was a drift of mist on the sea, whether the baker’s was open yet, whose carriage it was that we could hear passing, commenting on the daily insignificant curtain-raiser, the banal introit that no one ever attends, a scrap of life shared only by us, to which I would smugly refer later in Françoise’s presence or when talking with other people, informing them of the peasouper there had been at six a.m., showing off not because I had been gifted with special knowledge, but because I had been singled out for affectionate attention by this quiet and gentle morning moment, opening like a symphony with the rhythmic dialogue between my three knocks and the answering three, ardently desired and twice repeated, given back by the partition full of love and joy, its solid substance turned into happy harmonies and singing like an angels’ chorus, filled by the whole soul of my grandmother and the promise of her coming, sounding its glad annunciation with the fidelity of music. But on the night of our arrival, after my grandmother had left my room, I started feeling miserable again, as I had in Paris when it was time to leave for the station. That trepidation which overwhelmed me at the prospect of sleeping in an unfamilar bedroom – which is felt by many – may be nothing more than the lowliest, most obscure, organic and all but unconscious mode of the supreme and desperate refusal, by those things which make up the best of our present life, to countenance even our theoretical acceptance of a possible future without them; a refusal which was the core of the horror I had so often felt at the thought that my parents would one day be dead, that the requirements of life might force me to live apart from Gilberte or just make me settle for good in a country where I would never see my friends again; a refusal which lurked beneath the difficulty I found in trying to think about my own death or even the kind of after-life promised by Bergotte in his books, in which there would be no place for my memories, my defects, my very character, all of which found unconscionable the idea of their own non-existence and hoped on my behalf that I was fated neither to unbeing nor to an everlasting life which would abolish them."
"J’avais fait quelques ouvertures à maman pour savoir si elle ferait de même quand viendrait Gilberte, point qui me semblait plus grave qu’à la cour de Louis XIV le « Monseigneur ». Mais maman ne voulut rien entendre.","I had made some overtures to Mama to find out if she would do the same when Gilberte came, a point which seemed to me more serious than at the court of Louis XIV the ""Monseigneur"". But mom didn't want to hear anything.",""" I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of 'Monseigneur.' But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment.","To me, whether Mama would agree to follow suit when Gilberte came to tea was a more serious matter than Louis XIV’s insistence that at Versailles only the Dauphin should be addressed as Monseigneur; and so I had broached it with her. She would hear nothing of it."
"– Mais Bergotte vient bien, lui ? Est-ce que vous trouvez que ce qu’il écrit n’est pas bien. Cela sera même mieux bientôt, ajoutait-elle, car il est plus aigu, plus concentré dans le journal que dans le livre où il délaie un peu. J’ai obtenu qu’il fasse désormais le « leader article » dans le Figaro. Ce sera tout à fait « the right man in the right place. »","""But Bergotte is fine, isn't he?"" Do you find that what he writes is not good. It will even be better soon, she added, because it is sharper, more concentrated in the diary than in the book where it is a bit delayed. I got him to be the “lead article” in Le Figaro from now on. It will be absolutely “the right man in the right place. »","""But Bergotte is coming, isn't he? Do you mean that you don't think it good , what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,"" she went on, ""for he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I've arranged that in future he's to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He'll be distinctly the 'right man in the right place' there.""","‘But, look here, Bergotte keeps coming, doesn’t he? And you don’t think his stuff isn’t well written, surely now, do you? You’ll see, he’ll be even better soon – since he’s taken up journalism, he’s actually sharper, and there’s more to him than in his books, where he tends to be a bit thinnish. I’ve managed to get him into the Figaro , he’s going to do their “leader article”.’ She used the English expression, to which she added another: ‘You’ll see, it’ll be a perfect case of “the right man in the right place”."
"Je m’en rendais compte et pourtant nous causions si peu. Tandis qu’avec Mme de Villeparisis ou Saint-Loup, j’eusse démontré par mes paroles beaucoup plus de plaisir que je n’en eusse ressenti, car je les quittais avec fatigue, au contraire couché entre ces jeunes filles, la plénitude de ce que j’éprouvais l’emportait infiniment sur la pauvreté, la rareté de nos propos et débordait de mon immobilité et de mon silence, en flots de bonheur dont le clapotis venait mourir au pied de ces jeunes roses.","I was aware of it and yet we talked so little. While with Madame de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup, I would have demonstrated by my words much more pleasure than I would have felt, for I left them with fatigue, on the contrary lying between these young girls, the fullness of this that I felt outweighed infinitely the poverty, the rarity of our words and overflowed from my immobility and my silence, in waves of happiness whose lapping came to die at the foot of these young roses.","All this I realised, and yet we talked so little. Whereas with Mme. de Villeparisis or Saint –Loup I should have displayed by my words a great deal more pleasure than I should actually have felt, for I used always to be worn out when I parted from them; when, on the other hand, I was lying on the grass among all these girls, the plenitude of what I was feeling infinitely outweighed the paucity, the infrequency of our speech, and brimmed over from my immobility and silence in floods of happiness, the waves of which rippled up to die at the feet of these young roses.","I was aware of all this, and yet we hardly ever had a conversation! With Mme de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup, my words would have made a show of much more enjoyment than I really felt, concealing the fact that they always wore me out; whereas when I lay among those girls, the full cup of my joy, unaffected by the insignificance and sparseness of what we said, brimming in motionless silence, overflowed and let the murmuring wavelets of my happiness lap and ripple among these young roses."
"Pendant qu’il disait ces mots, M. de Norpois était, pour quelques secondes encore, dans la situation de toutes les personnes qui, m’entendant parler de Swann comme d’un homme intelligent, de ses parents comme d’agents de change honorables, de sa maison comme d’une belle maison, croyaient que je parlerais aussi volontiers d’un autre homme aussi intelligent, d’autres agents de change aussi honorables, d’une autre maison aussi belle ; c’est le moment où un homme sain d’esprit qui cause avec un fou ne s’est pas encore aperçu que c’est un fou. M. de Norpois savait qu’il n’y a rien que de naturel dans le plaisir de regarder les jolies femmes, qu’il est de bonne compagnie, dès que quelqu’un nous parle avec chaleur de l’une d’elles, de faire semblant de croire qu’il en est amoureux, de l’en plaisanter, et de lui promettre de seconder ses desseins. Mais en disant qu’il parlerait de moi à Gilberte et à sa mère (ce qui me permettrait, comme une divinité de l’Olympe qui a pris la fluidité d’un souffle ou plutôt l’aspect du vieillard dont Minerve emprunte les traits, de pénétrer moi-même, invisible, dans le salon de Mme Swann, d’attirer son attention, d’occuper sa pensée, d’exciter sa reconnaissance pour mon admiration, de lui apparaître comme l’ami d’un homme important, de lui sembler à l’avenir digne d’être invité par elle et d’entrer dans l’intimité de sa famille), cet homme important qui allait user en ma faveur du grand prestige qu’il devait avoir aux yeux de Mme Swann, m’inspira subitement une tendresse si grande que j’eus peine à me retenir de ne pas embrasser ses douces mains blanches et fripées, qui avaient l’air d’être restées trop longtemps dans l’eau. J’en ébauchai presque le geste que je me crus seul à avoir remarqué. Il est difficile en effet à chacun de nous de calculer exactement à quelle échelle ses paroles ou ses mouvements apparaissent à autrui ; par peur de nous exagérer notre importance et en grandissant dans des proportions énormes le champ sur lequel sont obligés de s’étendre les souvenirs des autres au cours de leur vie, nous nous imaginons que les parties accessoires de notre discours, de nos attitudes, pénètrent à peine dans la conscience, à plus forte raison ne demeurent pas dans la mémoire de ceux avec qui nous causons. C’est d’ailleurs à une supposition de ce genre qu’obéissent les criminels quand ils retouchent après coup un mot qu’ils ont dit et duquel ils pensent qu’on ne pourra confronter cette variante à aucune autre version. Mais il est bien possible que, même en ce qui concerne la vie millénaire de l’humanité, la philosophie du feuilletoniste selon laquelle tout est promis à l’oubli soit moins vraie qu’une philosophie contraire qui prédirait la conservation de toutes choses. Dans le même journal où le moraliste du « Premier Paris » nous dit d’un événement, d’un chef-d’œuvre, à plus forte raison d’une chanteuse qui eut « son heure de célébrité » : « Qui se souviendra de tout cela dans dix ans ? », à la troisième page, le compte rendu de l’Académie des Inscriptions ne parle-t-il pas souvent d’un fait par lui-même moins important, d’un poème de peu de valeur, qui date de l’époque des Pharaons et qu’on connaît encore intégralement ? Peut-être n’en est-il pas tout à fait de même dans la courte vie humaine. Pourtant quelques années plus tard, dans une maison où M. de Norpois, qui se trouvait en visite, me semblait le plus solide appui que j’y pusse rencontrer, parce qu’il était l’ami de mon père, indulgent, porté à nous vouloir du bien à tous, d’ailleurs habitué par sa profession et ses origines à la discrétion, quand, une fois l’Ambassadeur parti, on me raconta qu’il avait fait allusion à une soirée d’autrefois dans laquelle il avait « vu le moment où j’allais lui baiser les mains », je ne rougis pas seulement jusqu’aux oreilles, je fus stupéfait d’apprendre qu’étaient si différentes de ce que j’aurais cru, non seulement la façon dont M. de Norpois parlait de moi, mais encore la composition de ses souvenirs ; ce « potin » m’éclaira sur les proportions inattendues de distraction et de présence d’esprit, de mémoire et d’oubli dont est fait l’esprit humain ; et, je fus aussi merveilleusement surpris que le jour où je lus pour la première fois, dans un livre de Maspero, qu’on savait exactement la liste des chasseurs qu’Assourbanipal invitait à ses battues, dix siècles avant Jésus-Christ.","While he was saying these words, M. de Norpois was, for a few more seconds, in the position of all the people who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his parents as stockbrokers honorable men, of his house as well as of a fine house, believed that I would speak just as willingly of another man as intelligent, of other stockbrokers as honorable, of another house as fine; it is the moment when a sane man who talks with a madman has not yet noticed that he is a madman. M. de Norpois knew that there is nothing but natural in the pleasure of looking at pretty women, that he is good company, as soon as someone speaks to us warmly of one of them, to pretend to believe that he is in love with her, to make fun of her, and to promise to support her designs. But by saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would allow me, like an Olympian divinity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath, or rather the aspect of the old man whose features Minerva borrows, to penetrate myself, invisible, into Madame Swann's salon, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear to her as the friend of an important man, to to seem to her in the future worthy of being invited by her and of entering into the intimacy of her family), this important man who was going to use in my favor the great prestige which he must have had in the eyes of Madame Swann, m I suddenly inhaled a tenderness so great that I could hardly restrain myself from kissing her soft, white, crumpled hands, which looked as if they had been in the water for too long. I almost sketched out the gesture that I thought I was the only one to have noticed. It is indeed difficult for each of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his movements appear to others; for fear of exaggerating our importance to ourselves and by enlarging in enormous proportions the field over which the memories of others are obliged to extend during the course of their life, we imagine that the accessory parts of our speech, of our attitudes, penetrate barely in the consciousness, a fortiori do not remain in the memory of those with whom we talk. It is, moreover, an assumption of this kind that criminals obey when they retouch after the fact a word they have said and of which they think that this variant cannot be compared with any other version. But it is quite possible that, even with regard to the millennial life of humanity, the philosophy of the serial writer according to which everything is destined to oblivion is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of all things. In the same newspaper where the moralist of the ""Premier Paris"" tells us of an event, of a masterpiece, a fortiori of a singer who had ""her hour of fame"": ""Who will remember all this in ten years? "", on the third page, does not the report of the Academy of Inscriptions often speak of a less important fact in itself, of a poem of little value, which dates from the time of the Pharaohs and which we still fully know? Perhaps it is not quite the same in the short human life. However, a few years later, in a house where M. de Norpois, who happened to be visiting, seemed to me the most solid support that I could find there, because he was my father's friend, indulgent, inclined to wishing well to us all, moreover accustomed by his profession and his origins to discretion, when, once the Ambassador left, I was told that he had alluded to an evening in the past in which he had "" saw the moment when I was going to kiss his hands"", I not only blushed ear to ear, I was amazed to learn that were so different from what I would have thought, not only the way Mr. Norpois spoke of me, but still the composition of his memories; this “gossip” enlightened me on the unexpected proportions of distraction and presence of mind, of memory and oblivion of which the human mind is made; and I was as marvelously surprised as the day when I read for the first time, in a book by Maspero, that we knew exactly the list of hunters that Ashurbanipal invited to his hunts, ten centuries before Jesus Christ.","While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann's drawing–room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family), this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they 'touch up' the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the ""Paris column"" says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her 'crowded hour': ""Who will remember this in ten years' time?"" overleaf does not the report of the Académie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle–tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero's books, that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ.","As he spoke these words and for a few seconds longer, M. de Norpois was in the position of anyone else who, on hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his respectable family firm of stockbrokers, of his fine house, assumed that I would speak in identical terms of any other equally intelligent man, of other just as respectable stockbrokers, of any other fine house; he was at the stage when the sane man has not quite realized that the man he is chatting with is insane. Also, he was perfectly aware that it is natural to enjoy the sight of pretty women, and that when a man speaks warmly of a pretty woman it is good form to pretend to believe he is in love with her, to share a little joke with him about it, and promise to put in a good word for him. But when he said he would mention me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like one of the gods of Olympus taking on the fluidity of a breath of air, or rather the appearance of the old man impersonated by Minerva, to be an invisible visitor to the salon of Mme Swann, there to capture her attention, be thought about by her, earn her gratitude for my admiration, and stand revealed as the friend of an important man, a worthy future guest at her house, someone who could be admitted to her family circle) I was suddenly so overcome by tender feelings for this important man, who was going to exercise on my behalf the great prestige he must enjoy in the eyes of Mme Swann, that I had to restrain myself from kissing his soft hands, so white and wrinkled that they looked as though they had spent too long steeped in water. I thought no one noticed how close I came to doing this. But it is difficult for any of us to gauge the scale on which others register our acts and words; for fear of seeing ourselves as over-important, and by magnifying hugely the dimensions to which other people’s memories must stretch if they are to cover a lifetime, we imagine that all the peripheral aspects of our speech and gestures make little imprint in the consciousness of the people we talk to, let alone stay in their memory. It is this sort of assumption which makes criminals retrospectively emend statements they have made, in the belief that no one will ever be able to compare the new variant with an older version. However, it is quite possible that, even in relation to the immemorial march of humanity, the newspaper columnist’s philosophy that everything passes away into oblivion may be less reliable than the opposite prediction, that all things will last. In a newspaper, in which the author of the leading article, a moralist commenting on some event, a masterpiece, or more likely just a songstress who has ‘had her hour of fame’, laments, ‘But who will remember any of this ten years from now?’, page three of the very same issue will carry an account of a session at the Academy of Antiquities concerning something which is of less intrinsic importance, a piece of doggerel, say, dating from the time of the Pharaohs, yet which is still known in its entirety. In a short human lifespan, of course, things may not happen quite like that. Nevertheless, some years later when I was a guest at a house, where among the other guests M. de Norpois seemed to be my surest ally, since he was not only a friend of my father’s and an indulgent man, well disposed to our family, but also inclined by profession and nature to be discreet, I was told after he left that he had spoken of an incident long ago ‘when I had been on the point of kissing his hand’. This not only made me blush to the roots of my hair; it also astounded me with the knowledge that both the ambassador’s way of speaking of me and the very stuff of his memory were very different from what I would have expected. This piece of gossip, by enlightening me on the make-up of human consciousness, and its unexpected potential for absent-mindedness and presence of mind, for memory and forgetfulness, was as much a wonder and a revelation to me as it had been to read in a book by Maspero, the Egyptologist, that the exact names of the huntsmen invited by Assurbanipal16 to his battues, ten centuries before Christ, were known to us."
"Je venais d’écrire à Gilberte une lettre où je laissais tonner ma fureur, non sans pourtant jeter la bouée de quelques mots placés comme au hasard, et où mon amie pourrait accrocher une réconciliation ; un instant après, le vent ayant tourné, c’était des phrases tendres que je lui adressais pour la douceur de certaines expressions désolées, de tels « jamais plus », si attendrissants pour ceux qui les emploient, si fastidieux pour celle qui les lira, soit qu’elle les croie mensongers et traduise « jamais plus » par « ce soir même, si vous voulez bien de moi » ou qu’elle les croie vrais et lui annonçant alors une de ces séparations définitives qui nous sont si parfaitement égales dans la vie quand il s’agit d’êtres dont nous ne sommes pas épris. Mais puisque nous sommes incapables tandis que nous aimons d’agir en dignes prédécesseurs de l’être prochain que nous serons et qui n’aimera plus, comment pourrions-nous tout à fait imaginer l’état d’esprit d’une femme à qui, même si nous savions que nous lui sommes indifférents, nous avons perpétuellement fait tenir dans nos rêveries, pour nous bercer d’un beau songe ou nous consoler d’un gros chagrin, les mêmes propos que si elle nous aimait. Devant les pensées, les actions d’une femme que nous aimons, nous sommes aussi désorientés que le pouvaient être devant les phénomènes de la nature, les premiers physiciens (avant que la science fût constituée et eût mis un peu de lumière dans l’inconnu). Ou pis encore, comme un être pour l’esprit de qui le principe de causalité existerait à peine, un être qui ne serait pas capable d’établir un lien entre un phénomène et un autre et devant qui le spectacle du monde serait incertain comme un rêve. Certes je m’efforçais de sortir de cette incohérence, de trouver des causes. Je tâchais même d’être « objectif » et pour cela de bien tenir compte de la disproportion qui existait entre l’importance qu’avait pour moi Gilberte et celle non seulement que j’avais pour elle, mais qu’elle-même avait pour les autres êtres que moi, disproportion qui, si je l’eusse omise, eût risqué de me faire prendre une simple amabilité de mon amie pour un aveu passionné, une démarche grotesque et avilissante de ma part pour le simple et gracieux mouvement qui vous dirige vers de beaux yeux. Mais je craignais aussi de tomber dans l’excès contraire, où j’aurais vu dans l’arrivée inexacte de Gilberte à un rendez-vous un mouvement de mauvaise humeur, une hostilité irrémédiable. Je tâchais de trouver entre ces deux optiques également déformantes celle qui me donnerait la vision juste des choses ; les calculs qu’il me fallait faire pour cela me distrayaient un peu de ma souffrance ; et soit par obéissance à la réponse des nombres, soit que je leur eusse fait dire ce que je désirais, je me décidai le lendemain à aller chez les Swann, heureux, mais de la même façon que ceux qui, s’étant tourmentés longtemps à cause d’un voyage qu’ils ne voulaient pas faire, ne vont pas plus loin que la gare, et rentrent chez eux défaire leur malle. Et comme, pendant qu’on hésite, la seule idée d’une résolution possible (à moins d’avoir rendu cette idée inerte en décidant qu’on ne prendra pas la résolution) développe, comme une graine vivace, les linéaments, tout le détail des émotions qui naîtraient de l’acte exécuté, je me dis que j’avais été bien absurde de me faire, en projetant de ne plus voir Gilberte, autant de mal que si j’eusse dû réaliser ce projet et que, puisque au contraire c’était pour finir par retourner chez elle, j’aurais pu faire l’économie de tant de velléités et d’acceptations douloureuses. Mais cette reprise des relations d’amitié ne dura que le temps d’aller jusqu’à chez les Swann, non pas parce que leur maître d’hôtel, lequel m’aimait beaucoup, me dit que Gilberte était sortie (je sus en effet, dès le soir même, que c’était vrai, par des gens qui l’avaient rencontrée), mais à cause de la façon dont il me le dit : « Monsieur, Mademoiselle est sortie, je peux affirmer à Monsieur que je ne mens pas. Si Monsieur veut se renseigner, je peux faire venir la femme de chambre. Monsieur pense bien que je ferais tout ce que je pourrais pour lui faire plaisir et que si Mademoiselle était là, je mènerais tout de suite Monsieur auprès d’elle. » Ces paroles, de la sorte qui est la seule importante, involontaires, nous donnant la radiographie au moins sommaire de la réalité insoupçonnable que cacherait un discours étudié, prouvaient que dans l’entourage de Gilberte on avait l’impression que je lui étais importun ; aussi, à peine le maître d’hôtel les eut-il prononcées, qu’elles engendrèrent chez moi de la haine à laquelle je préférai donner comme objet, au lieu de Gilberte, le maître d’hôtel ; il concentra sur lui tous les sentiments de colère que j’avais pu avoir pour mon amie ; débarrassé d’eux grâce à ces paroles, mon amour subsista seul ; mais elles m’avaient montré en même temps que je devais pendant quelque temps ne pas chercher à voir Gilberte. Elle allait certainement m’écrire pour s’excuser. Malgré cela, je ne retournerais pas tout de suite la voir, afin de lui prouver que je pouvais vivre sans elle. D’ailleurs, une fois que j’aurais reçu sa lettre, fréquenter Gilberte serait une chose dont je pourrais plus aisément me priver pendant quelque temps, parce que je serais sûr de la retrouver dès que je le voudrais. Ce qu’il me fallait pour supporter moins tristement l’absence volontaire, c’était sentir mon cœur débarrassé de la terrible incertitude de savoir si nous n’étions pas brouillés pour toujours, si elle n’était pas fiancée, partie, enlevée. Les jours qui suivirent ressemblèrent à ceux de cette ancienne semaine du jour de l’an que j’avais dû passer sans Gilberte. Mais cette semaine-là finie, jadis, d’une part mon amie reviendrait aux Champs-Élysées, je la reverrais comme auparavant, j’en étais sûr ; et, d’autre part, je savais avec non moins de certitude que tant que dureraient les vacances du jour de l’an, ce n’était pas la peine d’aller aux Champs-Élysées. De sorte que, durant cette triste semaine déjà lointaine, j’avais supporté ma tristesse avec calme parce qu’elle n’était mêlée ni de crainte ni d’espérance. Maintenant, au contraire, c’était ce dernier sentiment qui presque autant que la crainte rendait ma souffrance intolérable. N’ayant pas eu de lettre de Gilberte le soir même, j’avais fait la part de sa négligence, de ses occupations, je ne doutais pas d’en trouver une d’elle dans le courrier du matin. Il fut attendu par moi, chaque jour, avec des palpitations de cœur auxquelles succédait un état d’abattement quand je n’y avais trouvé que des lettres de personnes qui n’étaient pas Gilberte ou bien rien, ce qui n’était pas pire, les preuves d’amitié d’une autre me rendant plus cruelles celles de son indifférence. Je me remettais à espérer pour le courrier de l’après-midi. Même entre les heures des levées des lettres je n’osais pas sortir, car elle eût pu faire porter la sienne. Puis le moment finissait par arriver où, ni facteur ni valet de pied des Swann ne pouvant plus venir, il fallait remettre au lendemain matin l’espoir d’être rassuré, et ainsi, parce que je croyais que ma souffrance ne durerait pas, j’étais obligé pour ainsi dire de la renouveler sans cesse. Le chagrin était peut-être le même, mais au lieu de ne faire, comme autrefois, que prolonger uniformément une émotion initiale, recommençait plusieurs fois par jour en débutant par une émotion si fréquemment renouvelée qu’elle finissait – elle, état tout physique, si momentané – par se stabiliser, si bien que les troubles causés par l’attente ayant à peine le temps de se calmer avant qu’une nouvelle raison d’attendre survînt, il n’y avait plus une seule minute par jour où je ne fusse dans cette anxiété qu’il est pourtant si difficile de supporter pendant une heure. Ainsi ma souffrance était infiniment plus cruelle qu’au temps de cet ancien 1er janvier, parce que cette fois il y avait en moi, au lieu de l’acceptation pure et simple de cette souffrance, l’espoir, à chaque instant, de la voir cesser. À cette acceptation, je finis pourtant par arriver, alors je compris qu’elle devait être définitive et je renonçai pour toujours à Gilberte, dans l’intérêt même de mon amour, et parce que je souhaitais avant tout qu’elle ne conservât pas de moi un souvenir dédaigneux. Même, à partir de ce moment-là, et pour qu’elle ne pût former la supposition d’une sorte de dépit amoureux de ma part, quand, dans la suite, elle me fixa des rendez-vous, je les acceptais souvent et, au dernier moment, je lui écrivais que je ne pouvais pas venir, mais en protestant que j’en étais désolé comme j’aurais fait avec quelqu’un que je n’aurais pas désiré voir. Ces expressions de regret qu’on réserve d’ordinaire aux indifférents persuaderaient mieux Gilberte de mon indifférence, me semblait-il, que ne ferait le ton d’indifférence qu’on affecte seulement envers celle qu’on aime. Quand mieux qu’avec des paroles, par des actions indéfiniment répétées, je lui aurais prouvé que je n’avais pas de goût à la voir, peut-être en retrouverait-elle pour moi. Hélas ! ce serait en vain : chercher en ne la voyant plus à ranimer en elle ce goût de me voir, c’était la perdre pour toujours ; d’abord, parce que quand il commencerait à renaître, si je voulais qu’il durât, il ne faudrait pas y céder tout de suite ; d’ailleurs, les heures les plus cruelles seraient passées ; c’était en ce moment qu’elle m’était indispensable et j’aurais voulu pouvoir l’avertir que bientôt elle ne calmerait, en me revoyant, qu’une douleur tellement diminuée qu’elle ne serait plus, comme elle l’eût été encore en ce moment même, et pour y mettre fin, un motif de capitulation, de se réconcilier, de se revoir. Et enfin plus tard quand je pourrais enfin avouer sans péril à Gilberte, tant son goût pour moi aurait repris de force, le mien pour elle, celui-ci n’aurait pu résister à une si longue absence et n’existerait plus ; Gilberte me serait devenue indifférente. Je le savais, mais je ne pouvais pas le lui dire ; elle aurait cru que si je prétendais que je cesserais de l’aimer en restant trop longtemps sans la voir, c’était à seule fin qu’elle me dît de revenir vite auprès d’elle.","I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed my fury to thunder, not without, however, throwing the buoy of a few words placed as if at random, and in which my friend could hang on to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having turned, it was tender phrases that I addressed to him for the sweetness of certain sorry expressions, such ""never again"", so touching for those who use them, so tedious for those who will read them, either she believes them to be untrue and translates ""never again"" by ""this very evening, if you don't mind me"" or that she believes them to be true and then announces to him one of those definitive separations which are so perfectly equal to us in life. life when it comes to beings we are not in love with. But since we are incapable, while we love, of acting as worthy predecessors of the next being that we will be and who will no longer love, how could we quite imagine the state of mind of a woman to whom , even if we knew that we were indifferent to her, we perpetually kept in our daydreams, to lull us to a beautiful dream or console us for a great sorrow, the same words as if she loved us. Faced with the thoughts, the actions of a woman we love, we are as bewildered as could be before the phenomena of nature, the first physicists (before science was constituted and had shed a little light on the unknown ). Or worse still, like a being for whose mind the principle of causality would barely exist, a being who would not be able to establish a link between one phenomenon and another and before whom the spectacle of the world would be uncertain like a dream. Certainly I tried to get out of this inconsistency, to find causes. I even tried to be ""objective"" and for that to take into account the disproportion that existed between the importance that Gilberte had for me and that not only that I had for her, but that she herself had for beings other than myself, a disproportion which, if I had omitted it, would have run the risk of making me take a simple friendliness on my friend's part for a passionate confession, a grotesque and demeaning gait on my part for the simple and graceful movement which directs you towards beautiful eyes. But I was also afraid of falling into the opposite excess, where I would have seen in Gilberte's inaccurate arrival at a meeting a movement of bad humor, an irremediable hostility. I tried to find between these two equally distorting perspectives the one that would give me the right vision of things; the calculations I had to make for that distracted me a little from my suffering; and either by obedience to the answer of the numbers, or that I had made them say what I wanted, I decided the next day to go to the Swanns, happy, but in the same way as those who, having tormented themselves for a long time at because of a trip they did not want to make, do not go further than the station, and return home to unpack their trunk. And since, while one hesitates, the very idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered this idea inert by deciding that one will not take the resolution) develops, like a perennial seed, the lineaments, the whole detail of the emotions that would arise from the act performed, I told myself that it had been quite absurd to cause myself, by planning not to see Gilberte, as much harm as if I had had to carry out this project and that, since at the otherwise it was to end up going back to her, I could have saved myself from so many inclinations and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations only lasted long enough to go as far as the Swanns, not because their butler, who was very fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (I knew in fact , that same evening, that it was true, by people who had met her), but because of the way he told me: ""Sir, Mademoiselle is out, I can tell Monsieur that I am not lying not. If Monsieur wants to find out, I can have the maid come. Monsieur thinks that I would do everything I could to please him and that if Mademoiselle were there, I would take Monsieur to her right away. These words, of the sort that is the only important one, involuntary, giving us at least a cursory X-ray of the unsuspected reality that a studied speech would hide, proved that in Gilberte's entourage there was the impression that I was importuning her. ; so, no sooner had the butler uttered them than they engendered in me hatred to which I preferred to give as object, instead of Gilberte, the butler; he concentrated on himself all the feelings of anger that I had had for my friend; rid of them thanks to these words, my love remained alone; but they had shown me at the same time that I ought for some time not to seek to see Gilberte. She was definitely going to write to me to apologize. Despite that, I wouldn't go back to see her right away, to prove to her that I could live without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, seeing Gilberte would be something I could more easily deprive myself of for a while, because I would be sure to find her again as soon as I wanted. What I needed to bear voluntary absence less sadly was to feel my heart relieved of the terrible uncertainty of knowing if we weren't estranged forever, if she weren't engaged, gone, kidnapped. The days that followed resembled those of that old New Year's week that I must have spent without Gilberte. But once that week was over, on the one hand my friend would return to the Champs-Élysées, I would see her again as before, I was sure of it; and, on the other hand, I knew with no less certainty that as long as the New Year's vacation lasted, there was no point in going to the Champs-Élysées. So that, during that sad week already distant, I had borne my sadness calmly because it was mixed neither with fear nor with hope. Now, on the contrary, it was this last feeling which almost as much as fear made my suffering intolerable. Not having received a letter from Gilberte that very evening, I had made allowance for her negligence, her occupations, I had no doubt of finding one from her in the morning post. It was awaited by me, every day, with palpitations of the heart which succeeded a state of dejection when I had found there only letters from people who were not Gilberte or nothing, which was not worse. , the proofs of friendship of another making me more cruel those of her indifference. I began to hope again for the afternoon mail. Even between the hours when letters were collected, I dared not go out, for she could have had hers delivered. Then the moment finally arrived when, since neither postman nor footman of the Swanns could come any more, I had to put off until the next morning the hope of being reassured, and so, because I believed that my suffering would not last, I I was obliged, so to speak, to renew it constantly. Grief was perhaps the same, but instead of merely prolonging an initial emotion as before, began again several times a day, beginning with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended - it, a purely physical state, so momentary – by stabilizing, so that the troubles caused by the waiting barely had time to subside before a new reason to wait arose, there was not a single minute a day that I did not was in this anxiety which it is however so difficult to support during one hour. So my suffering was infinitely more cruel than at the time of that old January 1st, because this time there was in me, instead of the pure and simple acceptance of this suffering, the hope, at every moment, of the see it stop. At this acceptance, however, I ended up arriving, so I understood that it had to be definitive and I renounced Gilberte forever, in the very interest of my love, and because I wished above all that she should not keep any me a disdainful memory. Even from that moment, and so that she could not form the assumption of a kind of amorous vexation on my part, when, later on, she fixed appointments with me, I often accepted them and , at the last moment, I wrote to him that I could not come, but protesting that I was sorry about it as I would have done with someone whom I would not have wanted to see. Those expressions of regret which are usually reserved for the indifferent would persuade Gilberte of my indifference better, it seemed to me, than the tone of indifference which one affects only towards the one whom one loves. When better than with words, by indefinitely repeated actions, I would have proved to her that I had no taste to see her, perhaps she would find some for me. Alas! it would be in vain: to seek, while no longer seeing her, to rekindle in her this desire to see me, would be to lose her forever; first of all, because when it would begin to be reborn, if I wanted it to last, I wouldn't have to give in to it right away; besides, the most cruel hours would have passed; it was at this moment that she was indispensable to me and I would have liked to be able to warn her that soon she would calm, when she saw me again, only a pain so diminished that it would no longer be, as it had been. been still at this very moment, and to put an end to it, a reason for capitulation, for reconciliation, for seeing each other again. And finally later when I could finally admit without danger to Gilberte, so much her taste for me would have regained strength, mine for her, this one could not have resisted such a long absence and would no longer exist; Gilberte would have become indifferent to me. I knew it, but I couldn't tell him; she would have thought that if I pretended that I would stop loving her by staying too long without seeing her, it was for the sole purpose of her telling me to come back to her quickly.","I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions, those ""nevermores"" so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate 'nevermore' by 'this very evening, if you want me,' or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to examine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world's first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be 'objective' and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend's part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte's unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that next day I would go to the Swanns', happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution) develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side , I might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns'; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere), but because of the manner in which he said it. "" Sir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady's maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once. "" These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte's household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte's society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs–Elysées, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs–Elysées, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning's post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another's friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns' could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended—it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state—by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover's spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These expressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer (what a moment ago it would still have been), nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte (so far would her liking for me have regained its strength) my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to exist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not explain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once.","I had just dashed off a furious letter to Gilberte, being sure to place in it the life-buoy of a few apparently casual words to which she could cling if she wanted us to make up; but then in a quite different mood, I dashed off another full of loving words, in which I savoured the touching sweetness of certain forlorn expressions such as Never again, so moving for the one who writes, yet so boring for the one who reads, either because she suspects them of being false and translates Never again as This very evening, please, or because she thinks they are true and sees in them the promise of the sort of lifelong separation which we accept with utter indifference when dealing with people we do not love. But since we are unable, while we love, to act as the worthy predecessor to the next person we are going to be, the one who will no longer be in love, how could we accurately imagine the state of mind of a woman who, even though we knew we meant nothing to her, has always figured in our sweetest day-dreams, a figment of our illusive wish to fancy a future with her, or of our need to heal the heart she has broken, whispering to us things she would have said only if she had been in love with us? Faced with the thoughts or actions of a woman we love, we are as incapacitated as the very first physicians when faced with natural phenomena (in the time before science had come into being and shed a little light into the unknown); or even worse, we are like a being for whom the principle of causality hardly exists, who is incapable of perceiving a connection between one phenomenon and another, for whom the spectacle of the world is as unreliable as a dream. Of course I tried to escape from such chaos and find causes. I even tried to be ‘objective’, to remain aware of the disparity between the importance of Gilberte to me and not only my importance to her, but hers to all people other than myself, since otherwise I might have seen what was a mere civility on her part as a declaration of ungovernable passion, and an unseemly and degrading act on my own part as the pleasing spontaneity that impels a man towards a pretty face. But I was also wary of going to the other extreme, of reading a mere moment’s unpunctuality or bad temper as meaning that Gilberte had an implacable hostility towards me. Somewhere between these two points of view, each of them making for distortion, I tried to find a way of seeing things which was more accurate; the mental efforts this required distracted me a little from my pain; and whether from trust in the answers I arrived at, or whether I had biassed these answers towards what I wanted, I decided the following day to go back to the Swanns’, a resolution which left me happy, but happy after the manner of the man who, having worried for a long time about a journey he wishes he did not have to take, goes only as far as the station, before going back home to unpack his trunk. And since, during the period one has spent in hesitations, the merest glimpse of a possible determination to end them (unless one has precluded such a thought by resolving not to make such a determination) is like a sturdy seed out of which grow first the broad lines, then all the details of the feelings one could have once the act is accomplished, I reproached myself for having been so absurd, for having allowed my own notion of never seeing Gilberte again to make me suffer as much as if I had really been going to carry it out, telling myself that since the long and the short of it was that I was going back to see her , I might as well have saved myself so many agonizing changes of heart and dispiriting resolves. This renewal of my relationship with Gilberte lasted as long as it took me to reach her house. It ended, not because the butler, who liked me, said she was out (which was true, as I learned that evening from people who had met her), but because of the way he said it: ‘Mademoiselle is out, Monsieur. I swear to Monsieur I am telling the truth. If Monsieur would like to check what I am saying, I can fetch the maid. As Monsieur well knows, I would do anything for him, and if Mademoiselle was in, I would take Monsieur straight to her.’ These words of the butler’s, as important as only spontaneous words can be, because they give us at least a summary X-ray of an inscrutable reality which a rehearsed speech would conceal, proved that the household suspected my attentions were irksome to Gilberte; and as soon as he had finished speaking them, they aroused in me a gust of hatred, which I preferred to direct against him rather than against her; they focussed on him whatever feelings of anger I had harboured against her; they cleansed my love of these feelings, and it lived on without them; but they also taught me that for some time I should not try to see Gilberte again. She would be writing to me, no doubt, to apologize. Even so, I would make a point of not going round to see her straight away, just to show her I could live without her. And of course, once I had received her letter, to see her again would be something I could more easily postpone for a time, since I would be certain of being able to be with her whenever I wanted to. To be able to bear that self-imposed separation from her without too much sorrow, all I needed was to feel that my heart had been freed from the dreadful uncertainty of not knowing whether we had fallen out for ever, whether she might not be engaged to be married, or have left Paris, or eloped with somebody. The following days were somewhat like the New Year holiday I had once had to spend without a sight of Gilberte. But in those earlier days, I had been sure that, once the week was over, she would come back to the Champs-Élysées, and that I could see her as usual; and equally sure that there was no point in going to the Champs-Élysées until the New Year holiday had ended. Which was why, for the whole of that sad week, long past, it was with an untroubled mind that I had borne my sorrow, because it had neither fear nor hope in it. But this time my pain was unbearable, because I was tormented by a hope that was almost as strong as my fear. Not having received a letter from her by the afternoon post, I reminded myself of how remiss she could be in such things, of how busy she was, and I had no doubt there would be one by the morning. I awaited the postman each morning with a beating heart, a state which turned into dejection each time I found the post to consist either of letters from people who were not Gilberte or of no letters at all, an eventuality which was not harder to bear, since a token of friendship from someone else only made the evidence of her indifference to me the more wounding. Then each day I would start looking forward again to the afternoon post. Even between the delivery times I did not dare leave the house, since she might be sending the letter round by hand. Each evening the moment eventually came when neither the postman nor the Swanns’ footman could be expected, and I had to postpone the hope of possible consolation till the following morning; in this way, because I believed my pain could not last, I was obliged to keep on renewing it, so to speak. The sorrow I felt may have been the same sorrow all the time; but unlike my earlier sadness, it was not just a uniform continuation of an initial emotion; it started up several times each day, being at first an emotion which was so often renewed that, though it was a wholly physical state and quite momentary, it ended up at a stable level; and as the disturbance provoked by expectation barely had time to settle before a new reason for expectation arose, there was no moment of the day when I was not in the grip of that form of anguish which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So it was that my suffering was much crueller than it had been on that previous New Year’s Day, because this time, I was full not of a simple acceptance of it but of the hope, recurring at every instant, that it would end. I did eventually reach that state of acceptance. I reached too the realization that it was to be definitive, and so I gave up Gilberte for ever, in the interest of my love itself, but also because I hoped more than anything that she might remember me without contempt. In the future, if she ever sent me an invitation or a suggestion that we meet, I even made a point of accepting some of these, so as to prevent her from suspecting I was acting on anything like lover’s pique, and then at the last moment I wrote to cry off, with the sort of great protestations of disappointment that you send to someone you have no real desire to see. It seemed to me that these expressions of regret, usually reserved for people to whom one is indifferent, would be more successful in convincing Gilberte of my indifference towards her than the tone of feigned indifference that one uses with somebody one loves. Once I had proved to her, not just with words, but more effectively with reiterated actions, that I could see nothing pleasing in her company, perhaps she would come to realize there was something pleasing in my mine. Sadly, this was not to be: trying to make her discover something pleasing in my company by not seeing her was the surest way to lose her for ever. For one thing, if she ever did come to this discovery, I would want its effects to last, and so I would have to be careful not to enjoy them too soon; besides, the worst of my torment would be over by then; it was now that she was necessary to me; I wished I could warn her that, before long, the only purpose of her seeing me again would be to soothe a pain that would have faded so much as to no longer be, as it still was at this moment, a reason for her to allay it by giving in, and for both of us to make up and see each other again. And in the future, when Gilberte’s liking for me had once again become so strong that I could at last safely confess mine for her, I foresaw that mine would not have survived such a long absence, and that I would have come to feel indifferent to her. All this I knew; but if I had said so, she would just have assumed that, in saying I would stop loving her if I had to live without her for too long, my real purpose was to make her ask me to come back to her at once."

"« Mon Dieu, mais comme votre présence élève le niveau de la conversation ! » me dit, comme pour s’excuser auprès de Bergotte, Swann qui avait pris dans le milieu Guermantes l’habitude de recevoir les grands artistes comme de bons amis à qui on cherche seulement à faire manger les plats qu’ils aiment, jouer aux jeux ou, à la campagne, se livrer aux sports qui leur plaisent. « Il me semble que nous parlons bien d’art, ajouta-t-il. – C’est très bien, j’aime beaucoup ça », dit Mme Swann en me jetant un regard reconnaissant, par bonté et aussi parce qu’elle avait gardé ses anciennes aspirations vers une conversation plus intellectuelle. Ce fut ensuite à d’autres personnes, à Gilberte en particulier, que parla Bergotte. J’avais dit à celui-ci tout ce que je ressentais avec une liberté qui m’avait étonné et qui tenait à ce qu’ayant pris avec lui, depuis des années (au cours de tant d’heures de solitude et de lecture, où il n’était pour moi que la meilleure partie de moi-même), l’habitude de la sincérité, de la franchise, de la confiance, il m’intimidait moins qu’une personne avec qui j’aurais causé pour la première fois. Et cependant pour la même raison j’étais fort inquiet de l’impression que j’avais dû produire sur lui, le mépris que j’avais supposé qu’il aurait pour mes idées ne datant pas d’aujourd’hui, mais des temps déjà anciens où j’avais commencé à lire ses livres, dans notre jardin de Combray. J’aurais peut-être dû pourtant me dire que puisque c’était sincèrement, en m’abandonnant à ma pensée, que d’une part j’avais tant sympathisé avec l’œuvre de Bergotte et que, d’autre part, j’avais éprouvé au théâtre un désappointement dont je ne connaissais pas les raisons, ces deux mouvements instinctifs qui m’avaient entraîné ne devaient pas être si différents l’un de l’autre, mais obéir aux mêmes lois ; et que cet esprit de Bergotte, que j’avais aimé dans ses livres ne devait pas être quelque chose d’entièrement étranger et hostile à ma déception et à mon incapacité de l’exprimer. Car mon intelligence devait être une, et peut-être même n’en existe-t-il qu’une seule dont tout le monde est co-locataire, une intelligence sur laquelle chacun, du fond de son corps particulier, porte ses regards, comme au théâtre, où si chacun a sa place, en revanche, il n’y a qu’une seule scène. Sans doute, les idées que j’avais le goût de chercher à démêler n’étaient pas celles qu’approfondissait d’ordinaire Bergotte dans ses livres. Mais si c’était la même intelligence que nous avions lui et moi à notre disposition, il devait, en me les entendant exprimer, se les rappeler, les aimer, leur sourire, gardant probablement, malgré ce que je supposais, devant son œil intérieur, tout une autre partie de l’intelligence que celle dont une découpure avait passé dans ses livres et d’après laquelle j’avais imaginé tout son univers mental. De même que les prêtres, ayant la plus grande expérience du cœur, peuvent le mieux pardonner aux péchés qu’ils ne commettent pas, de même le génie, ayant la plus grande expérience de l’intelligence, peut le mieux comprendre les idées qui sont le plus opposées à celles qui forment le fond de ses propres œuvres. J’aurais dû me dire tout cela (qui d’ailleurs n’a rien de très agréable, car la bienveillance des hauts esprits a pour corollaire l’incompréhension et l’hostilité des médiocres ; or, on est beaucoup moins heureux de l’amabilité d’un grand écrivain qu’on trouve à la rigueur dans ses livres, qu’on ne souffre de l’hostilité d’une femme qu’on n’a pas choisie pour son intelligence, mais qu’on ne peut s’empêcher d’aimer). J’aurais dû me dire tout cela, mais ne me le disais pas, j’étais persuadé que j’avais paru stupide à Bergotte, quand Gilberte me chuchota à l’oreille :","“My God, but how your presence raises the level of the conversation! said to me, as if to apologize to Bergotte, Swann, who in Guermantes circles had got into the habit of receiving great artists like good friends whom you only try to get to eat the dishes they like, play games or, in the countryside, indulge in the sports that please them. “It seems to me that we are indeed talking about art,” he added. ""That's very good, I like it very much,"" said Madame Swann, giving me a grateful look, out of kindness and also because she had retained her former aspirations towards a more intellectual conversation. It was then to other people, to Gilberte in particular, that Bergotte spoke. I had told this one everything I felt with a freedom that had surprised me and which was due to what having taken with him for years (during so many hours of solitude and reading, where he was for me only the best part of myself), the habit of sincerity, frankness, confidence, he intimidated me less than a person with whom I would have spoken for the first time. And yet for the same reason I was very worried about the impression I must have made on him, the contempt I had supposed he would have for my ideas dating not from today, but from times past. already old where I had started to read his books, in our garden at Combray. I should perhaps have told myself, however, that since it was sincerely, abandoning myself to my thoughts, that on the one hand I had sympathized so much with the work of Bergotte and that, on the other hand, I I had experienced a disappointment at the theater for which I did not know the reasons, these two instinctive movements which had led me should not have been so different from each other, but obey the same laws; and that this spirit of Bergotte, which I had loved in his books, must not have been something entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and my inability to express it. Because my intelligence had to be one, and perhaps there is even only one of which everyone is co-tenant, an intelligence on which each, from the depths of his particular body, looks, like in the theatre, where everyone has their place, but there is only one stage. Undoubtedly, the ideas that I had a taste for trying to disentangle were not those that Bergotte ordinarily explored in his books. But if it was the same intelligence that he and I had at our disposal, he must, hearing me express them, remember them, love them, smile at them, probably keeping, despite what I supposed, before his inner eye , quite a different part of intelligence than that of which a cutting had passed into his books and from which I had imagined his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the greatest experience of the heart, can best forgive the sins they do not commit, so the genius, having the greatest experience of intelligence, can best understand the ideas that are the most opposed to those which form the basis of his own works. I should have told myself all this (which, moreover, is not very pleasant, because the benevolence of high spirits has as its corollary the incomprehension and hostility of the mediocre; however, we are much less happy with the friendliness of a great writer that one finds at a pinch in his books, that one does not suffer from the hostility of a woman whom one has not chosen for her intelligence, but whom one cannot prevent loving). I should have told myself all that, but didn't tell myself, I was convinced that I had seemed stupid to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:","Swann observed to me, as though to excuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. ""It seems to me that we're talking a great deal of art,"" he went on. "" But it's so nice , I do love it!"" said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before (in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself), the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me express those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind's eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books, an excerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest experience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest experience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this (though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds expressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving). I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:","Swann said to me. ‘Doesn’t your presence among us “raise the tone” of the conversation?’ It sounded like a discreet apology to Bergotte from the man who had borrowed from his friends the Guermantes their simple ways of entertaining great artists, inviting them as friends to one’s table, serving them their favourite dish, playing parlour-games to please them or, in the country, arranging for them to practise the sport of their choice. ‘We do seem to be talking about “Art”, don’t we?’ Swann added. – I should think so too! I think it’s very nice,’ Mme Swann said, thanking me with a glance in which I read kindness towards myself and a reminder of her former hankerings after more intellectual conversation. Bergotte turned to talk with some of the others, in particular Gilberte. I was surprised to realize how freely I had spoken to him of my thoughts and feelings. But over so many years, for so many private hours of reading and solitude, during which he had been simply the best part of myself, I had been so accustomed to relating to him in total sincerity, frankness and trust that I was less shy with him than if I had been talking with someone else for the first time. And yet, for that very reason, I was full of qualms about the impression I must have made on him, as my expectation that he would scorn my ideas was no recent thing, but dated from the time long ago when I had first read him, sitting out in the garden at Combray. Perhaps it should have occurred to me that, since both my great attraction to the works of Bergotte and the unaccountable disappointment I had experienced at the theatre were sincere, spontaneous reactions of my own mind, these two instinctive and irresistible responses could not be very different from each other, but must be governed by the same laws; and that therefore the spirit of Bergotte, which I had admired so much in his books, was very likely not so utterly alien and hostile to my disappointment, or to my inability to articulate it. For after all, my mind had to be a single thing; or perhaps there is only a single mind, in which everybody has a share, a mind to which all of us look, isolated though each of us is within a private body, just as at the theatre where, though every spectator sits in a separate place, there is only one stage. No doubt the ideas which Bergotte was in the habit of investigating in his books were not those I enjoyed trying to disentangle; but if it was true that he and I were bound to have recourse to the same mind, then it followed that, hearing me try to expound those ideas, he must recall them, like them and smile on them, while probably keeping his inner eye, despite whatever else I thought he might be doing, fixed on an area of mind remote from the one which had left a remnant of itself in his books, and which had been the origin of all I had imagined about his mental universe. Just as the priests with the broadest knowledge of the heart are those who can best forgive the sins they themselves never commit, so the genius with the broadest acquaintance with the mind can best understand ideas most foreign to those which fill his own works. I should have thought of all this, unpleasant though its implications are: for the benevolence one encounters in the person of broad vision has its sorry counterpart in the obtuse and churlish ways of the petty; and the happiness one may derive from the kindly encounter with a writer through his books counts for much less than the unhappiness caused by the animosity of a woman whom one has not chosen for her qualities of mind, but whom one cannot help loving. I should have thought of all this; but it did not occur to me, and I was convinced that Bergotte thought I was stupid. Then Gilberte whispered to me:"
"Je ne pouvais plus mépriser les modistes puisque Elstir m’avait dit que le geste délicat par lequel elles donnent un dernier chiffonnement, une suprême caresse aux nœuds ou aux plumes d’un chapeau terminé, l’intéresserait autant à rendre que celui des jockeys (ce qui avait ravi Albertine). Mais il fallait attendre mon retour, pour les modistes, à Paris, pour les courses et les régates, à Balbec où on n’en donnerait plus avant l’année prochaine. Même un yacht emmenant des femmes en linon blanc était introuvable.","I could no longer despise milliners since Elstir had told me that the delicate gesture by which they give a final crumpling, a supreme caress to the knots or the feathers of a finished hat, would interest him as much in rendering as that of the jockeys ( which had delighted Albertine). But we had to wait for my return, for the milliners, in Paris, for the races and the regattas, in Balbec where we wouldn't give any more until next year. Even a yacht carrying women in white linen could not be found.","I could no longer despise the milliners, now that Elstir had told me that the delicate touches by which they give a last refinement, a supreme caress to the ribbons or feathers of a hat after it is finished, would be as interesting to him to paint as the muscular action of the jockeys themselves (a statement which had delighted Albertine). But I must wait until I had returned—for milliners, to Paris—for regattas and races to Balbec, where there would be no more now until next year–. Even a yacht with women in white linen garments was not to be found.","To despise dressmakers was no longer possible, since Elstir had said that the deft and gentle gesture with which they give a final ruffle, a last caress, to the bows and feathers of a just-completed hat was as much a challenge to his artistry as any movement by a jockey, a statement which had delighted Albertine. However, I could not hope to see a dressmaker till my return to Paris, or a horse-race or a regatta till my return to Balbec, where no more were to be held until the following year. There was even a dearth of yachts with women on board wearing white lawn."
"Or la sincérité et le désintéressement de Saint-Loup étaient au contraire absolus et c’était cette grande pureté morale qui, ne pouvant se satisfaire entièrement dans un sentiment égoïste comme l’amour, ne rencontrant pas d’autre part en lui l’impossibilité qui existait par exemple en moi de trouver sa nourriture spirituelle autre part qu’en soi-même, le rendait vraiment capable, autant que moi incapable, d’amitié.","Now Saint-Loup's sincerity and disinterestedness were, on the contrary, absolute, and it was this great moral which existed for example in me to find its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in oneself, made it truly capable, as much as I incapable, of friendship.","As a matter of fact, Saint–Loup was absolutely sincere and disinterested, and it was this intense moral purity which, not being able to find entire satisfaction in a selfish sentiment such as love, nor on the other hand meeting in him the impossibility (which existed in me, for instance) of finding its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in himself, rendered him truly capable (just as I was incapable) of friendship.","Saint-Loup’s sincerity and disinterest were, pace Françoise, absolute. In fact, it was this complete integrity of his which, in its inability to find entire fulfilment in a self-regarding emotion such as love, and being, unlike myself, free of the impossibility of finding spiritual sustenance anywhere but within the self, made him as capable as I was incapable of friendship."
"Enfin je voyais clairement : « deux heures de l’après-midi ! » je sonnais, mais aussitôt je rentrais dans un sommeil qui cette fois devait être infiniment plus long si j’en jugeais par le repos et la vision d’une immense nuit dépassée, que je trouvais au réveil. Pourtant comme celui-ci était causé par l’entrée de Françoise, entrée qu’avait elle-même motivée mon coup de sonnette, ce nouveau sommeil, qui me paraissait avoir dû être plus long que l’autre et avait amené en moi tant de bien-être et d’oubli, n’avait duré qu’une demi-minute.","Finally I saw clearly: “Two o’clock in the afternoon! I rang, but immediately I fell back into a sleep which this time must have been infinitely longer if I judged by the rest and the vision of an immense outdated night, which I found on waking. However, as this one was caused by the entrance of Françoise, an entrance which was itself motivated by my ringing of the doorbell, this new sleep, which seemed to me to have been longer than the other and had brought in me so many well-being and oblivion, had only lasted half a minute.","At length I could reach and read it: ""Two o'clock in the afternoon!"" I rang; but at once I returned to a slumber which, this time, must have lasted infinitely longer, if I was to judge by the refreshment, the vision of an immense night overpassed, which I found on awakening. And yet as my awakening was caused by the entry of Françoise, and as her entry had been prompted by my ringing the bell, this second sleep which, it seemed to me, must have been longer than the other, and had brought me so much comfort and forgetfulness, could not have lasted for more than half a minute.","Able at last to make out the time – ‘Two o’clock in the afternoon!’ – I rang; but then I immediately fell into another sleep which, to judge by the feeling I had on waking from it, of being fully rested, and the vision I had of having slept through an immense length of night, must have been infinitely longer than the previous one. But since what woke me was Françoise coming in, in answer to my ring, this sleep which had seemed so much longer than the earlier one, and had afforded me such a depth of beneficent relief from consciousness, had lasted no more than half a minute."
"Mais si la promenade de la petite bande avait pour elle de n’être qu’un extrait de la fuite innombrable de passantes, laquelle m’avait toujours troublé, cette fuite était ici ramenée à un mouvement tellement lent qu’il se rapprochait de l’immobilité. Or, précisément, que dans une phase aussi peu rapide, les visages non plus emportés dans un tourbillon, mais calmes et distincts, me parussent encore beaux, cela m’empêchait de croire, comme je l’avais fait si souvent quand m’emportait la voiture de Mme de Villeparisis, que, de plus près, si je me fusse arrêté un instant, tels détails, une peau grêlée, un défaut dans les ailes du nez, un regard benêt, la grimace du sourire, une vilaine taille, eussent remplacé dans le visage et dans le corps de la femme ceux que j’avais sans doute imaginés ; car il avait suffi d’une jolie ligne de corps, d’un teint frais entrevu, pour que de très bonne foi j’y eusse ajouté quelque ravissante épaule, quelque regard délicieux dont je portais toujours en moi le souvenir ou l’idée préconçue, ces déchiffrages rapides d’un être qu’on voit à la volée nous exposant ainsi aux mêmes erreurs que ces lectures trop rapides où, sur une seule syllabe et sans prendre le temps d’identifier les autres, on met à la place du mot qui est écrit un tout différent que nous fournit notre mémoire. Il ne pouvait en être ainsi maintenant. J’avais bien regardé leurs visages ; chacun d’eux je l’avais vu, non pas dans tous ses profils, et rarement de face, mais tout de même selon deux ou trois aspects assez différents pour que je pusse faire soit la rectification, soit la vérification et la « preuve » des différentes suppositions de lignes et de couleurs que hasarde la première vue, et pour voir subsister en eux, à travers les expressions successives, quelque chose d’inaltérablement matériel. Aussi, je pouvais me dire avec certitude que, ni à Paris, ni à Balbec, dans les hypothèses les plus favorables de ce qu’auraient pu être, même si j’avais pu rester à causer avec elles, les passantes qui avaient arrêté mes yeux, il n’y en avait jamais eu dont l’apparition, puis la disparition sans que je les eusse connues, m’eussent laissé plus de regrets que ne feraient celles-ci, m’eussent donné l’idée que leur amitié pût être une telle ivresse. Ni parmi les actrices, ou les paysannes, ou les demoiselles du pensionnat religieux, je n’avais rien vu d’aussi beau, imprégné d’autant d’inconnu, aussi inestimablement précieux, aussi vraisemblablement inaccessible. Elles étaient, du bonheur inconnu et possible de la vie, un exemplaire si délicieux et en si parfait état, que c’était presque pour des raisons intellectuelles que j’étais désespéré, de peur de ne pas pouvoir faire dans des conditions uniques, ne laissant aucune place à l’erreur possible, l’expérience de ce que nous offre de plus mystérieux la beauté qu’on désire et qu’on se console de ne posséder jamais, en demandant du plaisir – comme Swann avait toujours refusé de faire, avant Odette – à des femmes qu’on n’a pas désirées, si bien qu’on meurt sans avoir jamais su ce qu’était cet autre plaisir. Sans doute, il se pouvait qu’il ne fût pas en réalité un plaisir inconnu, que de près son mystère se dissipât, qu’il ne fût qu’une projection, qu’un mirage du désir. Mais, dans ce cas, je ne pourrais m’en prendre qu’à la nécessité d’une loi de la nature – qui, si elle s’appliquait à ces jeunes filles, s’appliquerait à toutes – et non à la défectuosité de l’objet. Car il était celui que j’eusse choisi entre tous, me rendant bien compte, avec une satisfaction de botaniste, qu’il n’était pas possible de trouver réunies des espèces plus rares que celles de ces jeunes fleurs qui interrompaient en ce moment devant moi la ligne du flot de leur haie légère, pareille à un bosquet de roses de Pennsylvanie, ornement d’un jardin sur la falaise, entre lesquelles tient tout le trajet de l’océan parcouru par quelque steamer, si lent à glisser sur le trait horizontal et bleu qui va d’une tige à l’autre, qu’un papillon paresseux, attardé au fond de la corolle que la coque du navire a depuis longtemps dépassée, peut pour s’envoler en étant sûr d’arriver avant le vaisseau, attendre que rien qu’une seule parcelle azurée sépare encore la proue de celui-ci du premier pétale de la fleur vers laquelle il navigue.","But if the promenade of the little band had for it to be only an extract from the innumerable flight of passers-by, which had always troubled me, this flight was here reduced to a movement so slow that it approached the 'immobility. Now, precisely, that in such a slow phase, faces no longer swept away in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct, still seemed beautiful to me, that prevented me from believing, as I had done so often when Madame de Villeparisis's car, that, closer up, if I had stopped for a moment, such details, a pockmarked skin, a defect in the wings of the nose, a stupid look, the grimace of a smile, an ugly waist, would have replaced in the face and in the body of the woman those that I had doubtless imagined; for all it took was a pretty line of the body, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to have added in very good faith some ravishing shoulder, some delicious gaze of which I always carried within me the memory or the preconceived idea , these rapid decipherings of a being that we see on the fly thus exposing us to the same errors as these too rapid readings where, on a single syllable and without taking the time to identify the others, we put in the place of the word which is written a completely different than our memory provides us. It couldn't be so now. I had looked closely at their faces; I had seen each of them, not in all its profiles, and rarely from the front, but all the same according to two or three aspects different enough for me to be able to make either the rectification, or the verification and the ""proof"" different suppositions of lines and colors that the first sight ventures, and to see subsisting in them, through the successive expressions, something inalterably material. Also, I could say to myself with certainty that, neither in Paris nor in Balbec, in the most favorable hypotheses of what could have been, even if I had been able to stay chatting with them, the passers-by who had stopped my eyes, there had never been one whose appearance, then disappearance without my having known them, would have left me with more regrets than those would do, would have given me the idea that their friendship could to be such a drunk. Neither among the actresses, or the peasant girls, or the young ladies of the religious boarding school, had I seen anything so beautiful, imbued with so much the unknown, so inestimably precious, so probably inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and possible happiness of life, such a delicious example and in such perfect condition, that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate, for fear of not being able to do under unique conditions, not leaving no room for possible error, the experience of what offers us the most mysterious beauty that we desire and that we console ourselves for never possessing, by asking for pleasure - as Swann had always refused to do, before Odette – to women we didn't desire, so much so that we die without ever having known what this other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that up close its mystery was dissipated, that it was only a projection, a mirage of desire. But, in this case, I could only blame the necessity of a law of nature - which, if it applied to these young girls, would apply to all - and not to the defectiveness of the object. For he was the one I would have chosen of all, realizing well, with the satisfaction of a botanist, that it was not possible to find united species rarer than those of these young flowers which interrupted at this moment in front of me the line of the water of their light hedge, resembling a copse of Pennsylvania roses, ornament of a garden on the cliff, between which holds the whole path of the ocean traveled by some steamer, so slow to glide on the line horizontal and blue that goes from one stalk to another, that a lazy butterfly, lingering at the bottom of the corolla that the ship's hull has long passed, can fly away, being sure of arriving before the ship , waiting for just a single patch of azure to separate the prow of it from the first petal of the flower towards which it is sailing.","But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis's carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a 'proof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure—as Swann had always refused to do before Odette's day—from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature—which if it applied to these girls would apply to all—and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist's satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering.","Though this little sauntering gang of girls was an example of the countless occasions when young passers-by had escaped my grasp, a failure which had always irked me, this time the escapers had slowed their pace almost to the point of immobility. That faces, instead of dashing past, should make a slow enough disappearance for their features to be set and distinct, yet still appear beautiful, prevented me from believing, as I had so often believed when Mme de Villeparisis’s carriage was whisking me further and further away from a young woman, that at close range, if I had been able to pause for a moment, certain details of her face or body – a pock-marked complexion, an imperfection in the nostrils, a dull look, a crude smile, a graceless waist – would have supplanted those which my imagination had seen in her; for often I had needed no more than a pretty contour of a body, a glimpse of a cool complexion, to create in all good faith a lovely shoulder to go with it, or a look from delightful eyes, memories or preconceptions which I carried about with me at all times; and such cursory decipherings of a creature seen in a fleeting glimpse expose us to the same misconceptions as hasty readings of a text, whereby, on the faith of a single syllable, and without pausing to identify the others, we replace the word printed by another quite different word proffered by memory. But this occasion had to be different: I had been able to have a close look at each of their faces; and though I had been unable to see any of them from both sides, and few of them in full face, I had still managed to sketch two or three aspects of them which were sufficiently different from one another for me to be able to make either the necessary adjustments to their different hypothetical contours and colours, as jotted down by my first glance, or the verification and proof of them, and to see through their few overlaid expressions to something which was immutably material. So I knew I could say with certainty that, whether in Paris or in Balbec, assuming the most favourable possible outcomes with any of the young women who had ever caught my eye in passing, if I had been able to pause for a while and chat , there had never been any whose appearance, then disappearance without anything coming of it, would have left me with such regrets as would these ones, or who could make me believe there would be such excitement in being their friend. No actress, no peasant girl, no boarder at a convent school had ever been so beautiful to me, so fascinating in a suggestion of the unknown, so invaluably precious, so probably unattainable. The exemplar these girls offered of life’s potential for bringing unsuspected happiness was so full of charm, in a state of such perfection, that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I despaired of ever being able to experience, in unique conditions which would allow no room for possible error, the profound mystery to be found in the beauty one has longed for, the beauty one replaces, because one knows it is for ever beyond one’s reach, by seeking mere pleasure from women one has not desired – which Swann had always refused to do, before meeting Odette – with the result that one dies without ever having enjoyed that other form of fulfilment. It was of course possible that there would have been no revelation in such a fulfilment, that the mystery would have been nothing but a projection or mirage of desire, to be dispelled by proximity. If so, I would have to blame an inescapable law of nature (which, if it was applicable to these girls, would be applicable to all girls), and not any defectiveness in the present object. For this present object was the one I would have preferred above all, as I knew perfectly well, having botanized so much among such young blossoms, that it would be impossible to come upon a bouquet of rarer varieties than these buds, which, as I looked at them now, decorated the line of the water with their gentle stems, like a gardenful of Carolina roses edging a cliff-top, where a whole stretch of ocean can fit between adjacent flowers, and a steamer is so slow to cover the flat blue line separating two stalks that an idling butterfly can loiter on a bloom which the ship’s hull has long since passed, and is so sure of being first to reach the next flower that it can delay its departure until the moment when, between the vessel’s bow and the nearest petal of the one towards which it is sailing, nothing remains but a tiny glowing gap of blue."
"– Chez quelles dindes, chez quelles garces sans éducation, chez quels goujats m’as-tu fourvoyée ? J’aime mieux te le dire, il n’y en avait pas un des hommes présents qui ne m’eût fait de l’œil, du pied, et c’est parce que j’ai repoussé leurs avances qu’ils ont cherché à se venger.","– Which turkeys, which uneducated bitches, which cads have you led me astray? I'd rather tell you, there wasn't one of the men present who wouldn't have given me the eye, the foot, and it's because I rejected their advances that they sought to take revenge.","As for the actress, she left the house with Saint–Loup, exclaiming: ""What do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner–boys? I don't mind telling you, there wasn't a man in the room who didn't make eyes at me or squeeze my foot, and it was because I wouldn't look at them that they were out for revenge.""","Brainless hussies, ill-mannered bitches and rotten pigs, the lot of them! I don’t mind telling you that those dirty old men spent the evening making eyes at me, every single one of them, and trying to play footy-footy with me, and it was because I refused to have anything to do with them that they decided to get their own back!’"
"Quant à l’artiste, elle sortit en disant à Saint-Loup :","As for the artist, she went out saying to Saint-Loup:","As for the actress, she left the house with Saint–Loup, exclaiming: ""What do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner–boys?","The artiste herself said to Saint-Loup as she was leaving, ‘God, what a gang!"
"Le restaurant n’était pas fréquenté seulement par des demi-mondaines, mais aussi par des gens du monde le plus élégant, qui y venaient goûter vers cinq heures ou y donnaient de grands dîners. Les goûters avaient lieu dans une longue galerie vitrée, étroite, en forme de couloir qui, allant du vestibule à la salle à manger, longeait sur un côté le jardin, duquel elle n’était séparée, sauf en exceptant quelques colonnes de pierre, que par le vitrage qu’on ouvrait ici ou là. Il en résultait, outre de nombreux courants d’air, des coups de soleil brusques, intermittents, un éclairage éblouissant, empêchant presque de distinguer les goûteuses, ce qui faisait que, quand elles étaient là, empilées deux tables par deux tables dans toute la longueur de l’étroit goulot, comme elles chatoyaient à tous les mouvements qu’elles faisaient pour boire leur thé ou se saluer entre elles, on aurait dit un réservoir, une nasse où le pêcheur a entassé les éclatants poissons qu’il a pris, lesquels à moitié hors de l’eau et baignés de rayons miroitent aux regards en leur éclat changeant.","The restaurant was frequented not only by demi-mondaines, but also by people of the most elegant society, who came there to tea at five o'clock or gave grand dinners there. Snacks took place in a long, narrow glazed gallery, in the form of a corridor which, going from the vestibule to the dining room, skirted on one side the garden, from which it was not separated, except by excepting a few stone columns, that through the windows that were opened here and there. The result was, in addition to numerous drafts, sudden, intermittent sunburn, dazzling lighting, almost making it impossible to distinguish the tasters, which meant that, when they were there, stacked two tables by two tables throughout the length of the narrow neck, as they shimmered with all the movements they made to drink their tea or greet each other, they looked like a tank, a trap where the fisherman has piled up the brilliant fish he has caught, which half out of the water and bathed in rays shimmer in their changing brilliance.","This restaurant was the resort not only of light women; it was frequented also by people in the very best society, who came there for afternoon tea or gave big dinner–parties. The tea–parties were held in a long gallery, glazed and narrow, shaped like a funnel, which led from the entrance hall to the dining–room and was bounded on one side by the garden, from which it was separated (save for a few stone pillars) only by its wall of glass, in which panes would be opened here and there. The result of which, apart from ubiquitous draughts, was sudden and intermittent bursts of sunshine, a dazzling light that made it almost impossible to see the tea–drinkers, so that when they were installed there, at tables crowded pair after pair the whole way along the narrow gully, as they were shot with colours at every movement they made in drinking their tea or in greeting one another, you would have called it a reservoir, a stewpond in which the fisherman has collected all his glittering catch, and the fish, half out of water and bathed in sunlight, dazzle the eye as they mirror an ever–changing iridescence.","Women of easy virtue were not the only people to frequent this restaurant; there were also people from the most fashionable society, who would go to it for afternoon tea or else held lavish dinner-parties there. Afternoon tea was served in a long, narrow gallery, like a corridor walled with glass, leading from the entrance-hall to the dining-room and forming one side of the garden, from which it was separated only by its few pillars of stone and the large windows, many of which were often open. The result of this arrangement was not only that it was very draughty, but that one was exposed to sudden and intermittent sunlight, a dazzling and unreliable form of illumination which made it all but impossible to make out the women taking tea; and when they sat there, crammed at pairs of tables along both sides of the narrow passageway, shimmering at every movement they made as they sipped their tea or greeted each other, the place looked like a tank or a creel which a fisherman has filled with his shiny catch, some of the fish being half out of the water, their sheen glinting and changing under glossy lights."
"Mais ce matin-là même, en quittant la princesse de Luxembourg, Mme de Villeparisis me dit une chose qui me frappa davantage et qui n’était pas du domaine de l’amabilité.","But that very morning, on leaving the Princess of Luxembourg, Madame de Villeparisis said something to me which struck me more and which was not in the realm of kindness.","But on that previous morning, after we had parted from the Princesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis said a thing which impressed me far more and was not prompted merely by friendly feeling.","I was even more struck by something else Mme de Villeparisis said that very forenoon, shortly after the Princess of Luxembourg had left us, and which had nothing to do with civility."
"Ma mère, pleine de respect pour les occupations de mon père, vint demander, timidement, si elle pouvait faire servir. Elle avait peur d’interrompre une conversation où elle n’aurait pas eu à être mêlée. Et, en effet, à tout moment mon père rappelait au marquis quelque mesure utile qu’ils avaient décidé de soutenir à la prochaine séance de Commission, et il le faisait sur le ton particulier qu’ont ensemble dans un milieu différent – pareils en cela à deux collégiens – deux collègues à qui leurs habitudes professionnelles créent des souvenirs communs où n’ont pas accès les autres et auxquels ils s’excusent de se reporter devant eux.","My mother, full of respect for my father's occupations, came to ask, timidly, if she could have someone serve. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation where she would not have had to be involved. And, in fact, my father constantly reminded the Marquis of some useful measure that they had decided to support at the next Commission meeting, and he did it in the particular tone that we have together in a different environment - the same in that to two college students – two colleagues to whom their professional habits create common memories to which others do not have access and to which they apologize for referring in front of them.","My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father's occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues—as exclusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college—whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience.","My mother, who was full of respect for any of my father’s occupations, came in to ask shyly whether it was time for her to have dinner served. She was reluctant to interrupt any conversation in which she was not supposed to be participating. So my father went on reminding the Marquis of some useful measure or other which they had decided to support at the next meeting of the Select Committee, in that special tone of voice used by two professional colleagues (or two class-mates) who, though out of their usual element, and in the presence of others who are not privy to the shared experiences of their other life, speak of these, while apologizing for doing so."
"S’il pleuvait, bien que le mauvais temps n’effrayât pas Albertine qu’on voyait souvent, dans son caoutchouc, filer en bicyclette sous les averses, nous passions la journée dans le Casino où il m’eût paru ces jours-là impossible de ne pas aller. J’avais le plus grand mépris pour les demoiselles d’Ambresac qui n’y étaient jamais entrées. Et j’aidais volontiers mes amies à jouer de mauvais tours au professeur de danse. Nous subissions généralement quelques admonestations du tenancier ou des employés usurpant un pouvoir directorial, parce que mes amies, même Andrée qu’à cause de cela j’avais cru le premier jour une créature si dionysiaque et qui était au contraire frêle, intellectuelle, et cette année-là fort souffrante, mais qui obéissait malgré cela moins à l’état de santé qu’au génie de cet âge qui emporte tout et confond dans la gaieté les malades et les vigoureux, ne pouvaient pas aller au vestibule, à la salle des fêtes, sans prendre leur élan, sauter par-dessus toutes les chaises, revenir sur une glissade en gardant leur équilibre par un gracieux mouvement de bras, en chantant, mêlant tous les arts, dans cette première jeunesse, à la façon de ces poètes des anciens âges pour qui les genres ne sont pas encore séparés, et qui mêlent dans un poème épique les préceptes agricoles aux enseignements théologiques.","If it rained, although the bad weather did not frighten Albertine, who was often seen riding her bicycle in the showers in her rubber, we would spend the day in the Casino, where it would have seemed impossible on those days not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young ladies of Ambresac who had never been there. And I would gladly help my friends play dirty tricks on the dance teacher. We generally endured a few admonishments from the tenant or the employees usurping managerial power, because my friends, even Andrée, who because of that I had believed on the first day to be such a Dionysian creature and who was on the contrary frail, intellectual, and this very ill year that year, but which obeyed in spite of that less the state of health than the genius of this age which carries away everything and confuses the sick and the vigorous in gaiety, could not go to the vestibule, to the meeting room. celebrations, without gaining momentum, jumping over all the chairs, coming back on a slide while keeping their balance with a graceful movement of the arm, singing, mixing all the arts, in this early youth, in the manner of those poets of the old ages for which the genres are not yet separated, and which mix in an epic poem the agricultural precepts with theological teachings.","If it rained, although the weather had no power to daunt Albertine, who was often to be seen in her waterproof spinning on her bicycle through the driving showers, we would Spend the day in the Casino, where on such days it would have seemed to me impossible not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young Ambresacs, who had never set foot in it. And I willingly joined my friends in playing tricks on the dancing master. As a rule we had to listen to admonition from the manager, or from some of his staff, usurping dictatorial powers, because my friends, even Andrée herself, whom on that account I had regarded when I first saw her as so dionysiac a creature, whereas in reality she was delicate, intellectual, and this year far from well, in spite of which her actions were controlled less by the state of her health than by the spirit of that age which overcomes every other consideration and confounds in a general gaiety the weak with the strong, could not enter the outer hall of the rooms without starting to run, jumping over all the chairs, sliding back along the floor, their balance maintained by a graceful poise of their outstretched arms, singing the while, mingling all the arts, in that first bloom of youth, in the manner of those poets of ancient days for whom the different 'kinds' were not yet separate, so that in an epic poem they would introduce rules of agriculture with theological doctrine.","If it was raining – not that wet weather daunted Albertine, who could be seen in her waterproof dashing along on her bicycle, through the pelting rain – we would spend the day in the Casino. On such days it would have been inconceivable to me not to go there. I scorned the d’Ambresac girls, who had never set foot in it; and I was glad to be a party to the tricks played on the dancing-master. We usually brought down on our heads the wrath of the proprietor or of any of his employees who saw themselves as acting in his stead, since my girl-friends (even Andrée, who on the very first day had made me think she was such a Dionysiac creature, yet who was actually not at all robust, but intellectual and, that year, quite unwell; despite which, unconcerned for the good of her health, she acted in conformity with the spirit of her time of life, an age which carries all before it, infecting with its gaiety not just the hale and the hearty but the lame and the halt as well) were incapable of walking from the entrance-hall to the reception-room without breaking into a run, hurdling the chairs, sliding back across the floor towards the others, keeping their balance with gracefully outstretched arms, singing, mingling all the arts, youth’s first blush manifesting itself in them as it did in those poets of antiquity for whom the different genres had not yet diverged, and who would adorn an epic poem with agricultural advice and theological instruction."
"Une fois de plus j’avais échappé à l’impossibilité de dormir, au déluge, au naufrage des crises nerveuses. Je ne craignais plus du tout ce qui me menaçait la veille au soir quand j’étais démuni de repos. Une nouvelle vie s’ouvrait devant moi ; sans faire un seul mouvement, car j’étais encore brisé quoique déjà dispos, je goûtais ma fatigue avec allégresse ; elle avait isolé et rompu les os de mes jambes, de mes bras, que je sentais assemblés devant moi, prêts à se rejoindre, et que j’allais relever rien qu’en chantant comme l’architecte de la fable.","Once again I had escaped the impossibility of sleeping, the deluge, the shipwreck of nervous crises. I no longer feared at all what threatened me the night before when I was deprived of rest. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still broken although already ready, I tasted my fatigue with joy; she had isolated and broken the bones of my legs, of my arms, which I felt assembled in front of me, ready to join, and which I was going to raise just by singing like the architect of the fable.","Once again I had escaped from the impossibility of sleeping, from the deluge, the shipwreck of my nervous storms. I feared now not at all the menaces that had loomed over me the evening before, when I was dismantled of repose. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still shattered, although quite alert and well, I savoured my weariness with a light heart; it had isolated and broken asunder the bones of my legs and arms, which I could feel assembled before me, ready to cleave together, and which I was to raise to life merely by singing, like the builder in the fable.","Once more I had escaped the impossibility of sleeping, and the ravages and the havoc of nervous disorder which it brought. Everything which had been a menace to me the night before, when I was without rest, was now incapable of alarming me. A new life stretched before me: without making a single movement, since I still felt crippled though already alert, I revelled in my exhaustion; it had dismembered me and broken the bones in my arms and legs, which I could feel lying there close by, ready to be reassembled, and which I was going to bring together again, with a mere song, like the builder in the fable.86"
"Or, le même mystère qui dérobe aux yeux souvent la cause des catastrophes, quand il s’agit de l’amour, entoure, tout aussi fréquemment la soudaineté de certaines solutions heureuses (telle que celle qui m’était apportée par la lettre de Gilberte). Solutions heureuses ou du moins qui paraissent l’être, car il n’y en a guère qui le soient réellement quand il s’agit d’un sentiment d’une telle sorte que toute satisfaction qu’on lui donne ne fait généralement que déplacer la douleur. Parfois pourtant une trêve est accordée et l’on a pendant quelque temps l’illusion d’être guéri.","Now, the same mystery which often conceals the cause of catastrophes when it is a question of love, surrounds just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions (such as that which was brought to me by Gilberte's letter ). Happy solutions, or at least those that seem to be, for there are hardly any that really are when it comes to a feeling of such a kind that any satisfaction given to it generally only displaces pain. Sometimes, however, a truce is granted and for some time one has the illusion of being healed.","Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte's letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed.","In love, it is not only the causes of catastrophe which may lie for ever beyond our grasp: just as often we remain in ignorance of the whys and wherefores of sudden outcomes which are happier – such as the one that Gilberte’s letter brought to me – or rather, outcomes which appear to be happy, as there are few truly happy outcomes in the life of a feeling which can generally look for no better reward than a shift in the site of the pain it entails. At times, however, a temporary remission is granted, and for a while one may have the illusion of being cured."
"Les parents de Gilberte, qui si longtemps m’avaient empêché de la voir, maintenant – quand j’entrais dans la sombre antichambre où planait perpétuellement, plus formidable et plus désirée que jadis à Versailles l’apparition du Roi, la possibilité de les rencontrer, et où habituellement, après avoir buté contre un énorme porte-manteaux à sept branches comme le Chandelier de l’Écriture, je me confondais en salutations devant un valet de pied assis, dans sa longue jupe grise, sur le coffre de bois et que dans l’obscurité j’avais pris pour Mme Swann – les parents de Gilberte, si l’un deux se trouvait à passer au moment de mon arrivée, loin d’avoir l’air irrité, me serraient la main en souriant et me disaient :","Gilberte's parents, who had so long prevented me from seeing her, now - when I entered the dark antechamber where the King's appearance perpetually hovered, more formidable and more desired than formerly at Versailles, the possibility of meeting them , and where usually, after having stumbled against an enormous coat rack with seven branches like the Candlestick of Scripture, I would merge in greetings in front of a seated footman, in his long gray skirt, on the wooden chest and that in the dark I had taken for Madame Swann – Gilberte's parents, if one of them happened to be passing when I arrived, far from looking irritated, shook my hand smiling and said to me :","Gilberte's parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now—when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat–stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood–box, whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann —Gilberte's parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:","Whenever I stepped into the Swanns’ dim ante-room, where the atmosphere thrilled with the perpetual possibility of meeting one or other of Gilberte’s parents, who had for so long prevented me from seeing her, an encounter more awesome but more longed-for than a glimpse of the King would have been at Versailles (and where I would trip over a huge seven-branched coat-stand like the Candlestick in Scripture,28 before effusively greeting a footman who sat in his long grey frock-coat on the firewood chest and whom I mistook in the half-dark for Mme Swann), if she or her husband did happen to cross my path at that moment, my hand was shaken, I was smiled upon and spoken to in an unirritated voice:"
"Ma mère, quand il fut question d’avoir pour la première fois M. de Norpois à dîner, ayant exprimé le regret que le professeur Cottard fût en voyage et qu’elle-même eût entièrement cessé de fréquenter Swann, car l’un et l’autre eussent sans doute intéressé l’ancien ambassadeur, mon père répondit qu’un convive éminent, un savant illustre, coMme Cottard, ne pouvait jamais mal faire dans un dîner, mais que Swann, avec son ostentation, avec sa manière de crier sur les toits ses moindres relations, était un vulgaire esbrouffeur que le marquis de Norpois eût sans doute trouvé, selon son expression, « puant ». Or cette réponse de mon père demande quelques mots d’explication, certaines personnes se souvenant peut-être d’un Cottard bien médiocre et d’un Swann poussant jusqu’à la plus extrême délicatesse, en matière mondaine, la modestie et la discrétion. Mais pour ce qui regarde celui-ci, il était arrivé qu’au « fils Swann » et aussi au Swann du Jockey, l’ancien ami de mes parents avait ajouté une personnalité nouvelle (et qui ne devait pas être la dernière), celle de mari d’Odette. Adaptant aux humbles ambitions de cette femme, l’instinct, le désir, l’industrie, qu’il avait toujours eus, il s’était ingénié à se bâtir, fort au-dessous de l’ancienne, une position nouvelle et appropriée à la compagne qui l’occuperait avec lui. Or il s’y montrait un autre homme. Puisque (tout en continuant à fréquenter seul ses amis personnels, à qui il ne voulait pas imposer Odette quand ils ne lui demandaient pas spontanément à la connaître) c’était une seconde vie qu’il commençait, en commun avec sa femme, au milieu d’êtres nouveaux, on eût encore compris que pour mesurer le rang de ceux-ci, et par conséquent le plaisir d’amour-propre qu’il pouvait éprouver à les recevoir, il se fût servi, comme un point de comparaison, non pas des gens les plus brillants qui formaient sa société avant son mariage, mais des relations antérieures d’Odette. Mais, même quand on savait que c’était avec d’inélégants fonctionnaires, avec des femmes tarées, parure des bals de ministères, qu’il désirait de se lier, on était étonné de l’entendre, lui qui autrefois et même encore aujourd’hui dissimulait si gracieusement une invitation de Twickenham ou de Buckingham Palace, faire sonner bien haut que la femme d’un sous-chef de cabinet était venue rendre sa visite à Mme Swann. On dira peut-être que cela tenait à ce que la simplicité du Swann élégant n’avait été chez lui qu’une forme plus raffinée de la vanité et que, comme certains israélites, l’ancien ami de mes parents avait pu présenter tour à tour les états successifs par où avaient passé ceux de sa race, depuis le snobisme le plus naïf et la plus grossière goujaterie, jusqu’à la plus fine politesse. Mais la principale raison, et celle-là applicable à l’humanité en général, était que nos vertus elles-mêmes ne sont pas quelque chose de libre, de flottant, de quoi nous gardions la disponibilité permanente ; elles finissent par s’associer si étroitement dans notre esprit avec les actions à l’occasion desquelles nous nous sommes fait un devoir de les exercer, que si surgit pour nous une activité d’un autre ordre, elle nous prend au dépourvu et sans que nous ayons seulement l’idée qu’elle pourrait comporter la mise en œuvre de ces mêmes vertus. Swann empressé avec ces nouvelles relations et les citant avec fierté, était comme ces grands artistes modestes ou généreux qui, s’ils se mettent à la fin de leur vie à se mêler de cuisine ou de jardinage, étalent une satisfaction naïve des louanges qu’on donne à leurs plats ou à leurs plates-bandes pour lesquels ils n’admettent pas la critique qu’ils acceptent aisément s’il s’agit de leurs chefs-d’œuvre ; ou bien qui, donnant une de leurs toiles pour rien, ne peuvent en revanche sans mauvaise humeur perdre quarante sous aux dominos.","My mother, when it was a question of having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was on a trip and that she herself had entirely ceased to see Swann, for one and the other would no doubt have interested the former ambassador, my father replied that an eminent guest, an illustrious scholar, like Madame Cottard, could never do wrong at a dinner, but that Swann, with his ostentation, with his way of on the roofs his least relations, was a vulgar show-off whom the Marquis de Norpois would no doubt have found, according to his expression, ""stinky."" Now this answer from my father requires a few words of explanation, some people perhaps remembering a very mediocre Cottard and a Swann pushing modesty and discretion to the most extreme delicacy in worldly matters. But as far as this one is concerned, it had happened that to the ""Swann son"" and also to the Swann of the Jockey, my parents' former friend, had added a new personality (and which was not to be the last), that husband of Odette. Adapting to the humble ambitions of this woman, the instinct, the desire, the industry, which he had always had, he had contrived to build himself, far below the old, a new position and appropriate to the companion who would occupy it with him. But there appeared another man. Since (while continuing to socialize alone with his personal friends, on whom he did not want to impose Odette when they did not spontaneously ask him to know her) it was a second life that he was beginning, together with his wife, in the middle new beings, one would still have understood that to measure the rank of these, and consequently the pleasure of self-love that he could experience in receiving them, he would have used, as a point of comparison, not not of the most brilliant people who formed his society before his marriage, but of Odette's previous relations. But, even when one knew that it was with inelegant civil servants, with insane women, adornment of the balls of ministries, that he wished to associate, one was astonished to hear him, he who formerly and even still today Today concealed an invitation from Twickenham or Buckingham Palace so graciously, to make it sound very loud that the wife of a Deputy Chief of Staff had come to pay a visit to Madame Swann. It will perhaps be said that this was due to the fact that the simplicity of the elegant Swann had been only a more refined form of vanity with him and that, like certain Jews, the former friend of my parents had been able to present in turn turn the successive states through which those of his race had passed, from the most naive snobbery and the grossest boorishness, to the finest politeness. But the main reason, and that one applicable to humanity in general, was that our virtues themselves are not something free, floating, of which we keep the permanent availability; they end up being so closely associated in our mind with the actions on the occasion of which we have made it our duty to exercise them, that if an activity of another order arises for us, it takes us unawares and without we only have the idea that it could include the implementation of these same virtues. Swann eager with these new relationships and quoting them with pride, was like those great modest or generous artists who, if they set themselves at the end of their life to dabble in cooking or gardening, display a naive satisfaction with the praises that one gives to their dishes or to their flowerbeds for which they do not admit the criticism which they accept easily if it is a question of their masterpieces; or else who, giving away one of their canvases for nothing, cannot on the other hand lose forty sous at the dominoes without a bad temper.","Madame Swann at Home MY mother, when it was a question of our having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was away from home, and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of Swann, since either of these might have helped to entertain the old Ambassador, my father replied that so eminent a guest, so distinguished a man of science as Cottard could never be out of place at a dinner–table, but that Swann, with his ostentation, his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew, however slightly, was an impossible vulgarian whom the Marquis de Norpois would be sure to dismiss as—to use his own epithet—a 'pestilent' fellow. Now, this attitude on my father's part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original 'young Swann' and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette's husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self–esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball–rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under–Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann's call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents' old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason—and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole—was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists—modest or generous by nature—who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes.","At Mme Swann’s When it was first suggested we invite M. de Norpois to dinner, my mother commented that it was a pity Professor Cottard was absent from Paris and that she herself had quite lost touch with Swann, either of whom the former ambassador would have been pleased to meet; to which my father replied that although a guest as eminent as Cottard, a scientific man of some renown, would always be an asset at one’s dinner-table, the Marquis de Norpois would be bound to see Swann, with his showing-off and his name-dropping, as nothing but a vulgar swank, ‘a rank outsider’, as he would put it. This statement of my father’s may require a few words of explanation, as there may be some who remember Cottard as a mediocrity and Swann as the soul of discretion and modesty in all things social. As regards Swann, it turns out that our old family friend was now no longer only ‘young Swann’ and ‘Swann of the Jockey Club’; to these personalities he had added a new one, which was not to be his last, that of Odette’s husband. Adapting to her humble ambitions all the flair, desires and industry which he had always possessed, Swann had contrived to construct a new position for himself, albeit far below the one he had formerly occupied, but suited to the wife with whom he must now share it. And in this position he had turned into a new man. Since this was the beginning of a second life for both of them, among a circle of new people (except for personal friends from his bachelor days whom he went on seeing alone, and whom he did not wish to burden with the acquaintance of Odette, unless they themselves expressed the wish to meet her), it would have been understandable if, in judging the social standing of these new people, and thereby gauging the degree of self-esteem that their company might afford him, his standard of comparison had been based at least on Odette’s former associates, if not on the exalted individuals among whom he himself had moved before his marriage. However, even when one knew that the people he now wished to associate with were unrefined civil servants, or the sort of dubious women who were fixtures of the annual ball at certain ministries, one could still be astounded to hear this man (who in former days, and even now, could show such exquisite tact in not advertising an invitation to Twickenham1 or Buckingham Palace) braying out the fact that the wife of an under-secretary’s under-secretary had returned Mme Swann’s visit. It may be thought that this was because the simplicity of manners in the fashionable Swann was only a finer form of vanity and that, after the manner of certain Jews, our old family friend had passed through the successive phases of a development observable in the breed he belonged to, going from the most guileless snobbery, the crassest caddishness, to the politest of refinements. The main reason, however, was (and it is one which holds good for all of humanity) that even our virtues are not extraneous, free-floating things which are always at our disposal; in fact they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions we feel they should accompany that, if we are required to engage in some different activity, it can take us by surprise, so that we never even think that it too might entail the use of those very virtues. In his gushing ways with these new friends and his boastful citing of their exploits, Swann was like the great artist who takes up cooking or gardening late in life and who, though modest enough to be untroubled by criticism of his masterpieces, cannot bear to hear faint praise of his recipes or flower-beds, and basks naïvely in the delight of hearing them lauded; or who, though generous enough to let a canvas go for nothing, will be put out by losing a few pence at dominoes."
"« Il n’y a pas de jour qu’une ou l’autre d’entre elles ne passe devant l’atelier et n’entre me faire un bout de visite », me dit Elstir, me désespérant aussi par la pensée que si j’avais été le voir aussitôt que ma grand-mère m’avait demandé de le faire, j’eusse probablement, depuis longtemps déjà, fait la connaissance d’Albertine.","""Not a day goes by that one or the other of them doesn't pass by the studio and come in to pay me a bit of a visit,"" Elstir told me, also driving me to despair by the thought that if I had gone to see him as soon as my grandmother had asked me to, I would probably have known Albertine a long time ago.","""Not a day passes but one or the other of them comes by here, and looks in for a minute or two,"" Elstir told me, plunging me in despair when I thought that if I had gone to see him at once, when my grandmother had begged me to do so , I should, in all probability, long since have made Albertine's acquaintance.","‘There’s hardly a day, Elstir said, when one or other of them doesn’t come down that lane and drop in to pay me a little visit,’ a statement that reduced me to despair – if I had gone to see him as soon as my grandmother had suggested it, I might well have made the acquaintance of Albertine long since!"
"– Une fois près de sa fille elle n’avait probablement rien à lui dire, répondit Mme de Villeparisis.","“Once near her daughter she probably had nothing to say to her,” replied Madame de Villeparisis.","""Once she was with her daughter, she had probably nothing to say to her,"" put in Mme. de Villeparisis.","‘Oh, once she was back together with her daughter, said Mme de Villeparisis, she probably had nothing to say to her. – Nothing of the kind, said M. de Charlus."
"Quand j’arrivai chez Elstir, un peu plus tard, je crus d’abord que Mlle Simonet n’était pas dans l’atelier. Il y avait bien une jeune fille assise, en robe de soie, nu-tête, mais de laquelle je ne connaissais pas la magnifique chevelure, ni le nez, ni ce teint, et où je ne retrouvais pas l’entité que j’avais extraite d’une jeune cycliste se promenant coiffée d’un polo, le long de la mer. C’était pourtant Albertine. Mais même quand je le sus, je ne m’occupai pas d’elle. En entrant dans toute réunion mondaine, quand on est jeune, on meurt à soi-même, on devient un homme différent, tout salon étant un nouvel univers où, subissant la loi d’une autre perspective morale, on darde son attention, comme si elles devaient nous importer à jamais, sur des personnes, des danses, des parties de cartes, que l’on aura oubliées le lendemain. Obligé de suivre, pour me diriger vers une causerie avec Albertine, un chemin nullement tracé par moi et qui s’arrêtait d’abord devant Elstir, passait par d’autres groupes d’invités à qui on me nommait, puis le long du buffet, où m’étaient offertes, et où je mangeais, des tartes aux fraises, cependant que j’écoutais, immobile, une musique qu’on commençait d’exécuter, je me trouvais donner à ces divers épisodes la même importance qu’à ma présentation à Mlle Simonet, présentation qui n’était plus que l’un d’entre eux et que j’avais entièrement oublié d’avoir été, quelques minutes auparavant, le but unique de ma venue. D’ailleurs n’en est-il pas ainsi, dans la vie active, de nos vrais bonheurs, de nos grands malheurs ? Au milieu d’autres personnes, nous recevons de celle que nous aimons la réponse favorable ou mortelle que nous attendions depuis une année. Mais il faut continuer à causer, les idées s’ajoutent les unes aux autres, développant une surface sous laquelle c’est à peine si de temps à autre vient sourdement affleurer le souvenir autrement profond, mais fort étroit, que le malheur est venu pour nous. Si, au lieu du malheur, c’est le bonheur, il peut arriver que ce ne soit que plusieurs années après que nous nous rappelons que le plus grand événement de notre vie sentimentale s’est produit, sans que nous eussions le temps de lui accorder une longue attention, presque d’en prendre conscience, dans une réunion mondaine par exemple, et où nous ne nous étions rendus que dans l’attente de cet événement.","When I arrived at Elstir's a little later, I thought at first that Mlle Simonet was not in the studio. There was indeed a young girl seated, in a silk dress, bare-headed, but of whom I did not know the magnificent hair, nor the nose, nor this complexion, and where I did not find the entity that I had. extracted from a young cyclist walking around wearing a polo shirt, along the sea. Yet it was Albertine. But even when I found out, I ignored her. By entering any social gathering, when one is young, one dies to oneself, one becomes a different man, every living room being a new universe where, subject to the law of another moral perspective, one darts one's attention, as if they were to matter to us forever, about people, dances, card games, which we will have forgotten the next day. Obliged to follow, to direct me to a chat with Albertine, a path in no way traced by me and which stopped first in front of Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was named, then along the sideboard , where strawberry pies were offered to me, and where I ate, while I listened, motionless, to music that was beginning to be played, I found myself giving these various episodes the same importance as my introduction to Mlle Simonet, an introduction who was only one of them and whom I had completely forgotten to have been, a few minutes earlier, the sole purpose of my visit. Moreover, is it not so, in active life, with our true happiness, our great misfortunes? In the midst of other people, we receive from the one we love the favorable or mortal response that we have been waiting for for a year. But we must continue to talk, the ideas are added to each other, developing a surface under which it is barely so from time to time that the otherwise deep, but very narrow memory comes to the surface that misfortune has come for us. we. If, instead of unhappiness, it is happiness, it may happen that it is only several years later that we remember that the greatest event of our sentimental life has occurred, without us having time for it. paying long attention, almost becoming aware of it, in a social gathering for example, and where we had only gone while waiting for this event.","When I arrived at Elstir's, a few minutes later, my first impression was that Mlle. Simonet was not in the studio. There was certainly a girl sitting there in a silk frock, bareheaded, but one whose marvellous hair, whose nose, meant nothing to me, in whom I did not recognise the human entity that I had formed out of a young cyclist strolling past, in a polo–cap, between myself and the sea. It was Albertine, nevertheless. But even when I knew it to be she, I gave her no thought. On entering any social gathering, when we are young, we lose consciousness of our old self, we become a different man, every drawing–room being a fresh universe, in which, coming under the sway of a new moral perspective, we fasten our attention, as if they were to matter to us for all time, on people, dances, card–tables, all of which we shall have forgotten by the morning. Obliged to follow, if I was to arrive at the goal of conversation with Albertine, a road in no way of my own planning, which first brought me to a halt at Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was presented, then along the table, at which I was offered, and ate, a strawberry tart or two, while I listened, motionless, to the music that was beginning in another part of the room, I found myself giving to these various incidents the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle. Simonet, an introduction which was now nothing more than one among several such incidents, having entirely forgotten that it had been, but a few minutes since, my sole object in coming there that day. But is it not ever thus in the bustle of daily life, with every true happiness, every great sorrow? In a room full of other people we receive from her whom we love the answer, propitious or fatal, which we have been awaiting for the last year. But we must go on talking, ideas come, one after another, forming a smooth surface which is pricked, at the very most, now and then by a dull throb from within of the memory, deep–rooted enough but of very slender growth, that misfortune has come upon us. If, instead of misfortune, it is happiness, it may be that not until many years have elapsed will we recall that the most important event in our sentimental life occurred without our having time to give it any prolonged attention, or even to become aware of it almost, at a social gathering, it may have been, to which we had gone solely in expectation of that event.","On arriving at Elstir’s a little later, I thought at first that Mlle Simonet was not in the studio. There was only a young lady, sitting down, wearing a silk dress, bare-headed, but whose magnificent hair was unknown to me, as were her nose and complexion, in none of which could I recognize the being I had constructed out of a young girl walking along the esplanade, pushing a bicycle and wearing a toque. Albertine it was, however. Yet, even after realizing this, I paid no attention to her. On going into a fashionable gathering as a young man, one takes leave of the person one was, one becomes a different man, each new salon being a new universe, in which, subject to the law of a new moral perspective, we focus acute attention on individuals, dances, games of cards, as though they were destined to be part of our life for ever, and which we will have forgotten by the following morning. Being obliged, in order to come eventually to a chat with Mlle Simonet, to follow a route which was not of my own design, which reached a first destination in front of Elstir, before leading me on to other groups of guests, to whom I was introduced, then along the buffet where I was handed, and where I ate, strawberry tarts, while pausing to listen to music which had just begun to be played, I found myself giving to these various episodes the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle Simonet, which was only one among their sequence, and which I had by now completely forgotten had been, a few minutes before, the sole object of my presence there. Does not the same happen, in busy everyday life, to our truest joys and greatest sorrows? We stand among other people, and the woman we adore gives us the answer, favourable or fatal, which we have been awaiting for a year: we must go on chatting; ideas lead to other ideas, making a surface beneath which, rising only from time to time, barely perceptible, lies the knowledge, very deep but acute, that calamity has struck. Or if it is happiness rather than calamity, we may not remember until years later that the most momentous event of our emotional life happened in a way which gives us no time to pay close attention to it, or even to be aware of it almost, during a fashionable reception, say, despite the fact that it was in expectation of some such event that we had gone to it."
"D’ailleurs, ce qu’une telle cure de détachement psychique et d’isolement peut avoir de pénible le devient de moins en moins pour une autre raison, c’est qu’elle affaiblit, en attendant de la guérir, cette idée fixe qu’est un amour. Le mien était encore assez fort pour que je tinsse à reconquérir tout mon prestige aux yeux de Gilberte, lequel, par ma séparation volontaire, devait, me semblait-il, grandir progressivement, de sorte que chacune de ces calmes et tristes journées où je ne la voyais pas, venant chacune après l’autre, sans interruption, sans prescription (quand un fâcheux ne se mêlait pas de mes affaires), était une journée non pas perdue, mais gagnée. Inutilement gagnée peut-être, car bientôt on pourrait me déclarer guéri. La résignation, modalité de l’habitude, permet à certaines forces de s’accroître indéfiniment. Celles si infimes, que j’avais pour supporter mon chagrin, le premier soir de ma brouille avec Gilberte, avaient été portées depuis lors à une puissance incalculable. Seulement la tendance de tout ce qui existe à se prolonger est parfois coupée de brusques impulsions auxquelles nous nous concédons avec d’autant moins de scrupules de nous laisser aller que nous savons pendant combien de jours, de mois, nous avons pu, nous pourrions encore, nous priver. Et souvent, c’est quand la bourse où l’on épargne va être pleine qu’on la vide tout d’un coup, c’est sans attendre le résultat du traitement et quand déjà on s’est habitué à lui, qu’on le cesse. Et un jour où Mme Swann me redisait ses habituelles paroles sur le plaisir que Gilberte aurait à me voir, mettant ainsi le bonheur dont je me privais déjà depuis si longtemps comme à la portée de ma main, je fus bouleversé en comprenant qu’il était encore possible de le goûter ; et j’eus peine à attendre le lendemain ; je venais de me résoudre à aller surprendre Gilberte avant son dîner.","Moreover, what such a cure for psychic detachment and isolation can have as painful becomes less and less so for another reason, it weakens, while waiting to cure it, this fixed idea that is a love. Mine was still strong enough for me to insist on regaining all my prestige in the eyes of Gilberte, who, by my voluntary separation, must, it seemed to me, grow gradually, so that each of these calm and sad days when I I didn't see it, coming each after the other, without interruption, without prescription (when an annoying person didn't meddle in my business), was a day not lost, but won. Unnecessarily gained perhaps, because soon I could be declared cured. Resignation, a modality of habit, allows certain forces to increase indefinitely. Those so minute that I had to bear my grief on the first evening of my estrangement with Gilberte had since been increased to incalculable power. Only the tendency of all that exists to be prolonged is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we allow ourselves with all the less scruples to let ourselves go that we know for how many days, months, we have been able, we could still , deprive us. And often, it's when the purse where you're saving is going to be full that you suddenly empty it, it's without waiting for the result of the treatment and when you've already gotten used to it, that we stop it. And one day when Madame Swann repeated to me her usual words about the pleasure that Gilberte would have in seeing me, thus putting the happiness of which I had already deprived myself for so long as within reach of my hand, I was overwhelmed to realize that it was still possible to taste it; and I could hardly wait for the morrow; I had just made up my mind to go and surprise Gilberte before her dinner.","Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte's estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription (unless some busy–body were to meddle in my affairs), was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those—so wretchedly inadequate—that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm's length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until next day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner.","There is another reason why the pains of this treatment by isolation and emotional withdrawal may be gradually lessened, which is that, as a preliminary to curing us of the obsessive preoccupation of our love, it weakens the force of it. My own love was still strong enough for me to want Gilberte to look at me again with the eyes of admiration. So with every day that passed, it seemed to me that my prestige, because of my self-imposed separation from her, must be slowly growing in her eyes; and that each of these days of calm sadness when I saw nothing of her, in their gradual accumulation, with neither interruption nor expected expiry-time (unless some ill-advised person interfered with my arrangements), was a day gained, and not lost, to my love. A day pointlessly gained, perhaps, as I might soon be pronounced cured. Resignation, which is one of the modes of habit, favours the indefinite growth of some of our resources. By now, the puny forces which, on the evening of my first breach with Gilberte, were all I had at my command to help me bear my heartbreak, had been raised to an incalculable power. However, the tendency of all existing things to go on existing is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses, which we obey without great qualms at breaking our own rule, since we know, from all those days and months when we have already managed to abstain, for how many more of them we would be able to make our abstention last. It is often when the purse in which we have been putting by our savings is nearly full that we suddenly decide to spend them all; it is when we have become used to a course of treatment, rather than when it has had its full effect, that we abandon it. One day, as Mme Swann spoke the usual words about how pleased Gilberte would be to see me, setting within my reach the happiness I had deprived myself of for so long, all at once I was overwhelmed by the knowledge that it was still possible to have it. I could hardly wait for the next day – I had just decided to surprise Gilberte by turning up at her house the following afternoon, before dinner-time."
"Car – comme la baie de Balbec était un petit univers à part au milieu du grand, une corbeille des saisons où étaient rassemblés en cercle les jours variés et les mois successifs, si bien que, non seulement les jours où on apercevait Rivebelle, ce qui était signe d’orage, on y distinguait du soleil sur les maisons pendant qu’il faisait noir à Balbec, mais encore que quand les froids avaient gagné Balbec, on était certain de trouver sur cette autre rive deux ou trois mois supplémentaires de chaleur – ceux de ces habitués du Grand-Hôtel dont les vacances commençaient tard ou duraient longtemps faisaient, quand arrivaient les pluies et les brumes, à l’approche de l’automne, charger leurs malles sur une barque, et traversaient rejoindre l’été à Rivebelle ou à Costedor. Ce petit groupe de l’hôtel de Balbec regardait d’un air méfiant chaque nouveau venu, et, ayant l’air de ne pas s’intéresser à lui, tous interrogeaient sur son compte leur ami le maître d’hôtel. Car c’était le même – Aimé – qui revenait tous les ans faire la saison et leur gardait leurs tables ; et mesdames leurs épouses, sachant que sa femme attendait un bébé, travaillaient après les repas chacune à une pièce de la layette, tout en nous toisant avec leur face à main, ma grand’mère et moi, parce que nous mangions des œufs durs dans la salade, ce qui était réputé commun et ne se faisait pas dans la bonne société d’Alençon. Ils affectaient une attitude de méprisante ironie à l’égard d’un Français qu’on appelait Majesté et qui s’était, en effet, proclamé lui-même roi d’un petit îlot de l’Océanie peuplé par quelques sauvages. Il habitait l’hôtel avec sa jolie maîtresse, sur le passage de qui quand elle allait se baigner, les gamins criaient : « Vive la reine ! » parce qu’elle faisait pleuvoir sur eux des pièces de cinquante centimes. Le premier président et le bâtonnier ne voulaient même pas avoir l’air de la voir, et si quelqu’un de leurs amis la regardait, ils croyaient devoir le prévenir que c’était une petite ouvrière.","Because - as the bay of Balbec was a small universe apart in the middle of the big one, a basket of the seasons where the varied days and the successive months were gathered in a circle, so that, not only the days when one could see Rivebelle, which was a sign of a storm, you could make out the sun on the houses there while it was dark in Balbec, but even when the cold weather had reached Balbec, you were sure to find two or three additional months of heat on this other bank – those of those regulars of the Grand-Hôtel whose holidays started late or lasted a long time, when the rains and mists arrived, at the approach of autumn, loaded their trunks on a boat, and crossed to join the summer at Rivebelle or in Costedor. This little group from the Hotel de Balbec looked suspiciously at each newcomer, and, seeming not to be interested in him, they all questioned their friend the butler on his account. Because it was the same one – Aimé – who came back every year for the season and kept their tables for them; and ladies their wives, knowing that his wife was expecting a baby, each worked after meals on a piece of layette, while staring at us with their face to hand, my grandmother and me, because we ate hard-boiled eggs in the salad, which was reputedly common and was not done in the good society of Alençon. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony towards a Frenchman who was called Majesté and who had, in fact, proclaimed himself king of a small island in Oceania peopled by a few savages. He lived in the hotel with his pretty mistress, on whose passage when she went to bathe, the boys cried: ""Long live the queen!"" because she was raining fifty cent coins on them. The first president and the president of the bar did not even want to appear to see her, and if any of their friends looked at her, they thought they had to warn him that she was a little worker.","For—inasmuch as the Bay of Balbec was a little world apart in the midst of a great world, a basketful of the seasons in which were clustered in a ring good days and bad, and the months in their order, so that not only, on days when one could make out Rivebelle, which was in itself a sign of coming storms, could one see the sunlight on the houses there while Balbec was plunged in darkness, but later on, when the cold weather had reached Balbec, one could be certain of finding on that opposite shore two or three supplementary months of warmth— those of the regular visitors to the Grand Hotel whose holidays began late or lasted long, gave orders, when rain and fog came and Autumn was in the air, for their boxes to be packed and embarked, and set sail across the Bay to find summer again at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group in the Balbec hotel looked with distrust upon each new arrival, and while affecting to take not the least interest in him, hastened, all of them, to ply with questions their friend the head waiter. For it was the same head waiter—Aimé—who returned every year for the season, and kept their tables for them; and their good ladies, having heard that his wife was 'expecting,' would sit after meals working each at one of the 'little things,' stopping only to put up their glasses and stare at us, my grandmother and myself, because we were eating hard–boiled eggs in salad, which was considered common, and was, in fact, 'not done' in the best society of Alençon. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony with regard to a Frenchman who was called 'His Majesty' and had indeed proclaimed himself King of a small island in the South Seas, inhabited by a few savages. He was staying in the hotel with his pretty mistress, whom, as she crossed the beach to bathe, the little boys would greet with ""Three cheers for the Queen!"" because she would reward them with a shower of small silver. The chief magistrate and the barrister went so far as to pretend not to see her, and if any of their friends happened to look at her, felt bound to warn him that she was only a little shop–girl.","The fact was that – since the Bay of Balbec was a little universe all to itself set amid the wider one, a posy of seasons composed of different sorts of days and many months, this meant that not only on days when one could see Rivebelle clearly (a thunder-storm warning, the sun shining on houses over there while the sky darkened over Balbec), but also when the colder weather had come to Balbec, one was always sure of two or three months more of warm days on that distant shore – each year when rains and fogs promised the coming of autumn, those regulars at the Grand-Hôtel whose holidays started late or lasted a long time had their luggage hoisted on to a boat and sailed across to continue their summer at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group at the Balbec hotel would look askance at any new-comers and, though seeming to take no interest in them, would interrogate their friend the head waiter about them. Aimé by name, this head waiter was there for the season every year and made sure they all had the tables they preferred. Each of their good ladies, knowing that Aimé’s wife was expecting a baby, would work after meal-times at making baby-clothes, now and again glaring through their lorgnettes at my grandmother and myself because we liked to have hard-boiled eggs in our salad, a taste which was known to be ‘common’, quite unheard-of among the best families of Alençon. They and their husbands affected a posture of ironic disdain towards a Frenchman whom everyone called ‘Your Majesty’ and who had actually proclaimed himself king of the few savage tenants of a tiny islet in the South Seas. He was living at the hotel with his pretty mistress; and whenever she tripped out towards her bathing cabin, little boys would shout, ‘Hurrah for the Queen!’ , she being in the habit of tossing handfuls of half-franc pieces in their direction. The bâtonnier from Cherbourg and the First President from Caen did their best to appear not to see her; and if anyone of their acquaintance looked at her, they felt duty-bound to point out that she was a mere mill-girl."
"Comme ces soirs-là je rentrais plus tard, je retrouvais avec plaisir dans ma chambre qui n’était plus hostile le lit où, le jour de mon arrivée, j’avais cru qu’il me serait toujours impossible de me reposer et où maintenant mes membres si las cherchaient un soutien ; de sorte que successivement mes cuisses, mes hanches, mes épaules tâchaient d’adhérer en tous leurs points aux draps qui enveloppaient le matelas, comme si ma fatigue, pareille à un sculpteur, avait voulu prendre un moulage total d’un corps humain. Mais je ne pouvais m’endormir, je sentais approcher le matin ; le calme, la bonne santé n’étaient plus en moi. Dans ma détresse, il me semblait que jamais je ne les retrouverais plus. Il m’eût fallu dormir longtemps pour les rejoindre. Or, me fussé-je assoupi, que de toutes façons je serais réveillé deux heures après par le concert symphonique. Tout à coup je m’endormais, je tombais dans ce sommeil lourd où se dévoilent pour nous le retour à la jeunesse, la reprise des années passées, des sentiments perdus, la désincarnation, la transmigration des âmes, l’évocation des morts, les illusions de la folie, la régression vers les règnes les plus élémentaires de la nature (car on dit que nous voyons souvent des animaux en rêve, mais on oublie presque toujours que nous y sommes nous-mêmes un animal privé de cette raison qui projette sur les choses une clarté de certitude ; nous n’y offrons au contraire, au spectacle de la vie, qu’une vision douteuse et à chaque minute anéantie par l’oubli, la réalité précédente s’évanouissant devant celle qui lui succède comme une projection de lanterne magique devant la suivante quand on a changé le verre), tous ces mystères que nous croyons ne pas connaître et auxquels nous sommes en réalité initiés presque toutes les nuits ainsi qu’à l’autre grand mystère de l’anéantissement et de la résurrection. Rendue plus vagabonde par la digestion difficile du dîner de Rivebelle, l’illumination successive et errante de zones assombries de mon passé faisait de moi un être dont le suprême bonheur eût été de rencontrer Legrandin avec lequel je venais de causer en rêve.","As on those evenings I came home later, I found with pleasure in my room, which was no longer hostile, the bed where, the day of my arrival, I had believed that it would always be impossible for me to rest and where now my weary limbs sought support; so that successively my thighs, my hips, my shoulders tried to adhere in all their points to the sheets which enveloped the mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wanted to take on a complete molding of a human body. But I could not fall asleep, I felt the morning approaching; calm, good health were no longer in me. In my distress, it seemed to me that I would never find them again. It would have taken me a long sleep to join them. Now, had I dozed off, I would have been awakened two hours later by the symphony concert anyway. Suddenly I fell asleep, I fell into this heavy sleep where the return to youth is revealed to us, the resumption of past years, lost feelings, disincarnation, the transmigration of souls, the evocation of the dead, the illusions of madness, regression to the most elementary realms of nature (for it is said that we often see animals in dreams, but we almost always forget that we ourselves there are an animal deprived of this reason which projects onto things a clarity of certainty; on the contrary, we only offer to the spectacle of life a dubious vision and at each minute annihilated by oblivion, the previous reality vanishing before that which succeeds it like a projection lantern in front of the next one when the glass has been changed), all those mysteries that we think we don't know and which we are actually initiated almost every night as well as the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection . Made more wandering by the difficult digestion of dinner at Rivebelle, the successive and wandering illumination of darkened zones of my past made me a being whose supreme happiness would have been to meet Legrandin with whom I had just talked in a dream.","As on these evenings I came back later than usual to the hotel, it was with joy that I recognised, in a room no longer hostile, the bed on which, on the day of my arrival, I had supposed that it would always be impossible for me to find any rest, whereas now my weary limbs turned to it for support; so that, in turn, thighs, hips, shoulders burrowed into, trying to adhere at every angle to, the sheets that covered its mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wished to take a cast of an entire human body. But I could not go to sleep; I felt the approach of morning; peace of mind, health of body, were no longer mine. In my distress it seemed that never should I recapture them. I should have had to sleep for a long time if I were to overtake them. But then, had I begun to doze , I must in any event be awakened in a couple of hours by the symphonic concert on the beach. Suddenly I was asleep, I had fallen into that deep slumber in which are opened to us a return to childhood, the recapture of past years, of lost feelings, the disincarnation, the transmigration of the soul, the evoking of the dead, the illusions of madness, retrogression towards the most elementary of the natural kingdoms (for we say that we often see animals in our dreams, but we forget almost always that we are ourself then an animal deprived of that reasoning power which projects upon things the light of certainty; we present on the contrary to the spectacle of life only a dubious vision, destroyed afresh every moment by oblivion, the former reality fading before that which follows it as one projection of a magic lantern fades before the next as we change the slide), all those mysteries which we imagine ourselves not to know and into which we are in reality initiated almost every night, as we are into the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. Rendered more vagabond by the difficulty of digesting my Rivebelle dinner, the successive and flickering illumination of shadowy zones of my past made of me a being whose supreme happiness would have been that of meeting Legrandin, with whom I had just been talking in my dream.","As I was back late to the hotel on those nights, it was a pleasure to walk into the bedroom, which had stopped being hostile, and find the bed, in which I had been sure on first arriving that I could never go to sleep, and which was now a comfort to my weary limbs; and one after the other, my thighs, my hips, my shoulders tried to imprint their every feature in the sheets enveloping the mattress, as though my tiredness were a sculptor moulding a cast of the whole human body. However, sleep evaded me: I was aware of the imminence of the morning; peace of mind and well-being of body were no longer in me. In my distress, I felt I had lost them for ever. To enjoy them again, I would have needed to sleep for a long time. But even if I had fallen asleep, I would still have been wakened a couple of hours later by the symphony concert. Then suddenly I was unconscious, submerged in the dense sleep which reveals to us mysteries such as youth regained, the rediscovery of years past and emotions once felt, disincarnation, the transmigration of souls, the summoning-up of the dead, the illusions of the mad, travel in time back to the most primitive stages of nature (for it is said we often see animals in our dreams, forgetting that, almost always when we dream, we ourselves are animals deprived of the clarity of certainty shed on all things by our faculty of reason; instead of it, all we can turn on the spectacle of life is an infirm gaze which is abolished by oblivion at every successive moment, each reality no sooner glimpsed than vanishing in the face of the next one, as the slides projected by a magic lantern succeed one another), mysteries which we think are closed to us, yet which we are admitted to almost every night, just as we are to the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. The difficulty of digesting the Rivebelle dinner meant that it was in a more fitful light that I visited in incoherent succession the darkened zones of my past life, and that I became a creature for whom supreme happiness would have been to meet Legrandin, with whom I had just had a dream conversation."
"J’avais beau être assez désappointé d’avoir trouvé en Mlle Simonet une jeune fille trop peu différente de tout ce que je connaissais, de même que ma déception devant l’église de Balbec ne m’empêchait pas de désirer aller à Quimperlé, à Pont-Aven et à Venise, je me disais que par Albertine du moins, si elle-même n’était pas ce que j’avais espéré, je pourrais connaître ses amies de la petite bande.","Although I was rather disappointed at having found in Mlle Simonet a young girl too little different from all I knew, just as my disappointment at the church of Balbec did not prevent me from wanting to go to Quimperlé, to Pont-Aven and Venice, I said to myself that through Albertine at least, if she herself was not what I had hoped for, I could get to know her friends from the little gang.","Whatever my disappointment in finding in Mlle. Simonet a girl so little different from those that I knew already, just as my rude awakening when I saw Balbec Church did not prevent me from wishing still to go to Quimperlé, Pont–Aven and Venice, I comforted myself with the thought that through Albertine at any rate, even if she herself was not all that I had hoped, I might make the acquaintance of her comrades of the little band.","Disappointed as I was with Mlle Simonet, a young girl not very different from others I knew, I consoled myself with the thought (just as my disappointment with the church of Balbec had not affected my desire to go to Quimperlé, Pont-Aven and Venice) that, even though she had not lived up to my expectations, at least through her I would be able to meet her friends in the little gang."
"– Ah, vraiment ? cela ne m’étonne pas !",- Ah really ? That does not surprise me !,"""Was it indeed? I'm not surprised to hear it.""","– Is that so? Well, I’m not surprised!"
en y ajoutant :,by adding:,with which he will include:,without forgetting:
"– Eh bien, qu’est-ce que dirait l’église de Balbec si elle savait que c’est avec cet air malheureux qu’on s’apprête à aller la voir ? Est-ce cela le voyageur ravi dont parle Ruskin ? D’ailleurs, je saurai si tu as été à la hauteur des circonstances, même loin je serai encore avec mon petit loup. Tu auras demain une lettre de ta maman.","“Well, what would the church of Balbec say if it knew that it was with this unhappy look that they were about to go to see it? Is this the delighted traveler of whom Ruskin speaks? Besides, I will know if you have lived up to the circumstances, even far away I will still be with my little wolf. Tomorrow you will have a letter from your mother.","""Well, and what would Balbec church say if it knew that people pulled long faces like that when they were going to see it? Surely this is not the enraptured tourist Ruskin speaks of. Besides, I shall know if you rise to the occasion, even when we are miles apart I shall still be with my little man. You shall have a letter to–morrow from Mamma.""","‘Dear me, whatever would the church of Balbec say if it knew we were getting ready to come and see it with such a long face? Can this be the delighted traveller that Mr Ruskin writes about? Anyway, I’ll know whether you’ve managed to keep a stiff upper lip. Even though I’ll be miles and miles away, I’ll still be with my little chap – and he’ll have a letter from his loving Mama tomorrow."
"Cette année-là, à Balbec, au moment de ces rencontres, j’assurais à ma grand’mère, à Mme de Villeparisis qu’à cause d’un grand mal de tête, il valait mieux que je rentrasse seul à pied. Elles refusaient de me laisser descendre. Et j’ajoutais la belle fille (bien plus difficile à retrouver que ne l’est un monument, car elle était anonyme et mobile) à la collection de toutes celles que je me promettais de voir de près. Une pourtant se trouva repasser sous mes yeux, dans des conditions telles que je crus que je pourrais la connaître comme je voudrais. C’était une laitière qui vint d’une ferme apporter un supplément de crème à l’hôtel. Je pensai qu’elle m’avait aussi reconnu et elle me regardait, en effet, avec une attention qui n’était peut-être causée que par l’étonnement que lui causait la mienne. Or le lendemain, jour où je m’étais reposé toute la matinée, quand Françoise vint ouvrir les rideaux vers midi, elle me remit une lettre qui avait été déposée pour moi à l’hôtel. Je ne connaissais personne à Balbec. Je ne doutai pas que la lettre ne fût de la laitière. Hélas, elle n’était que de Bergotte qui, de passage, avait essayé de me voir, mais ayant su que je dormais m’avait laissé un mot charmant pour lequel le liftman avait fait une enveloppe que j’avais cru écrite par la laitière. J’étais affreusement déçu, et l’idée qu’il était plus difficile et plus flatteur d’avoir une lettre de Bergotte ne me consolait en rien qu’elle ne fût pas de la laitière. Cette fille-là même, je ne la retrouvai pas plus que celles que j’apercevais seulement de la voiture de Mme de Villeparisis. La vue et la perte de toutes accroissaient l’état d’agitation où je vivais et je trouvais quelque sagesse aux philosophes qui nous recommandent de borner nos désirs (si toutefois ils veulent parler du désir des êtres, car c’est le seul qui puisse laisser de l’anxiété, s’appliquant à de l’inconnu conscient. Supposer que la philosophie veut parler du désir des richesses serait trop absurde). Pourtant j’étais disposé à juger cette sagesse incomplète, car je me disais que ces rencontres me faisaient trouver encore plus beau un monde qui fait ainsi croître sur toutes les routes campagnardes des fleurs à la fois singulières et communes, trésors fugitifs de la journée, aubaines de la promenade, dont les circonstances contingentes qui ne se reproduiraient peut-être pas toujours m’avaient seules empêché de profiter, et qui donnent un goût nouveau à la vie.","That year, at Balbec, at the time of these meetings, I assured my grandmother, Madame de Villeparisis that because of a severe headache, it was better that I walk home alone. They refused to let me down. And I added the beautiful girl (much more difficult to find than a monument, because she was anonymous and mobile) to the collection of all those I promised myself to see up close. One, however, happened to pass before my eyes, in such conditions that I thought I could get to know her as I wished. She was a milkmaid who came from a farm to bring extra cream to the hotel. I thought she had recognized me, too, and she was indeed looking at me with an attention that was perhaps only caused by her astonishment at mine. Now the next day, when I had rested all morning, when Françoise came to open the curtains around noon, she gave me a letter which had been left for me at the hotel. I didn't know anyone at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milkmaid. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, passing through, had tried to see me, but knowing that I was asleep had left me a charming note for which the liftman had made an envelope which I had thought had been written by the milkmaid. . I was terribly disappointed, and the idea that it was more difficult and more flattering to have a letter from Bergotte did nothing to console me that it was not from the milkmaid. I couldn't find that girl any more than the ones I saw only from Madame de Villeparisis' carriage. The sight and the loss of all increased the state of agitation in which I lived and I found some wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to limit our desires (if however they want to speak of the desire of beings, because it is the only one that can leaving anxiety, applying itself to the conscious unknown. To suppose that philosophy means the desire for wealth would be too absurd). Yet I was ready to judge this wisdom incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus causes flowers to grow on all the country roads, both singular and common, fugitive treasures of the day, windfalls of walking, of which contingent circumstances which would perhaps not always recur had alone prevented me from profiting, and which give a new taste to life.","That year at Balbec, at the moments of such encounters, I would assure my grandmother and Mme. de Villeparisis that I had so severe a headache that the best thing for me would be to go home alone on foot. But they would never let me get out of the carriage. And I must add that pretty girl ( far harder to find again than an historic building, for she was nameless and had the power of locomotion) to the collection of all those whom I promised myself that I would examine more closely at a later date. One of them, however, happened to pass more than once before my eyes in circumstances which allowed me to believe that I should be able to get to know her when I chose. This was a milk–girl who came from a farm with an additional supply of cream for the hotel. I fancied that she had recognised me also; and she did, in fact, look at me with an attentiveness which was perhaps due only to the surprise which my attentiveness caused her. And next day, a day on which I had been resting all morning, when Françoise came in about noon to draw my curtains, she handed me a letter which had been left for me downstairs. I knew no one at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milk–girl. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, as he happened to be passing, had tried to see me, but on hearing that I was asleep had scribbled a few charming lines for which the lift–boy had addressed an envelope which I had supposed to have been written by the milk–girl. I was bitterly disappointed, and the thought that it was more difficult, and more flattering to myself to get a letter from Bergotte did not in the least console me for this particular letter's not being from her. As for the girl, I never came across her again any more than I came across those whom I had seen only from Mme. de Villeparisis's carriage. Seeing and then losing them all thus increased the state of agitation in which I was living, and I found a certain wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to set a limit to our desires (if, that is, they refer to our desire for people, for that is the only kind that ends in anxiety, having for its object a being at once unknown and unconscious. To suppose that philosophy could refer to the desire for wealth would be too silly.). At the same time I was inclined to regard this wisdom as incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus caused to grow along all the country roads flowers at once rare and common, fleeting treasures of the day, windfalls of the drive, of which the contingent circumstances that would never, perhaps, recur had alone prevented me from taking advantage, and which gave a new zest to life.","That year in Balbec, when we passed these girls on the road, I told my grandmother and Mme de Villeparisis that I had a bad headache, but that I would feel much better if I could get out of the carriage and walk home unaccompanied. They never agreed to my suggestion. So the lovely girl, like a famous building (though much more difficult to see again than any building, being nameless and of no fixed location), was added to the collection of all those I had been promising myself to have a closer look at. There was one, however, whom I did catch sight of a second time, in circumstances which made me think it might be possible to get to know her properly. She was a milk-maid; and she came down one day from her farm to deliver an extra supply of cream to the hotel. The way she looked at me made me think she had recognized me too, though her interest may only have been caused by her surprise at the way I was looking at her. The following day, when Françoise came to open my bedroom curtains about midday, I having spent the whole morning resting, she brought me a letter which had been left for me by hand. Knowing no one in Balbec, I was sure it must be from the milk-maid! But, sad to say, it was only from Bergotte: he had been passing through and had called at the hotel to see me; but when they told him I was still asleep, he had left a charming note, which the ‘lift’ had slipped into an envelope and addressed in a hand which I had taken for the milk-maid’s. I was dreadfully disappointed; and the idea that it was much more difficult, as well as more flattering, to have a letter from Bergotte than from a milk-maid was no consolation. And I was to see no more of the girl than of the others only glimpsed from Mme de Villeparisis’s carriage. These glimpses, and the loss of every girl glimpsed, aggravated the state of agitation in which I spent my days; and I wished for the wisdom of the philosophers who counsel the curbing of desires (assuming they mean one’s desire for another person, as that is the only mode of desire which can lead to anxiety, focussing as it does on a world beyond our ken but within our awareness – to assume they mean desire for wealth would be too absurd). At the same time I was inclined to find something lacking in this wisdom, sensing well enough that these glimpsed encounters made for greater beauty in a world which sows such flowers, rare though common, along every country roadside, a new spice being added to life by the untried treasures of each day, by every outing with its unkept promises, my enjoyment of which had hitherto been prevented only by contingent circumstances which might not always be present."
"Cependant Mme Bontemps, qui avait dit cent fois qu’elle ne voulait pas aller chez les Verdurin, ravie d’être invitée aux mercredis, était en train de calculer comment elle pourrait s’y rendre le plus de fois possible. Elle ignorait que Mme Verdurin souhaitait qu’on n’en manquât aucun ; d’autre part, elle était de ces personnes peu recherchées, qui quand elles sont conviées à des « séries » par une maîtresse de maison, ne vont pas chez elle, comme ceux qui savent toujours faire plaisir, quand ils ont un moment et le désir de sortir ; elles, au contraire, se privent par exemple de la première soirée et de la troisième, s’imaginant que leur absence sera remarquée, et se réservent pour la deuxième et la quatrième ; à moins que, leurs informations leur ayant appris que la troisième sera particulièrement brillante, elles ne suivent un ordre inverse, alléguant que « malheureusement la dernière fois elles n’étaient pas libres ». Telle Mme Bontemps supputait combien il pouvait y avoir encore de mercredis avant Pâques et de quelle façon elle arriverait à en avoir un de plus, sans pourtant paraître s’imposer. Elle comptait sur Mme Cottard, avec laquelle elle allait revenir, pour lui donner quelques indications. « Oh ! Mme Bontemps, je vois que vous vous levez, c’est très mal de donner ainsi le signal de la fuite. Vous me devez une compensation pour n’être pas venue jeudi dernier… Allons, rasseyez-vous un moment. Vous ne ferez tout de même plus d’autre visite avant le dîner. Vraiment vous ne vous laissez pas tenter, ajoutait Mme Swann et tout en tendant une assiette de gâteaux : Vous savez que ce n’est pas mauvais du tout ces petites saletés-là. Ça ne paye pas de mine, mais goûtez-en, vous m’en direz des nouvelles. – Au contraire, ça a l’air délicieux, répondait Mme Cottard, chez vous, Odette, on n’est jamais à court de victuailles. Je n’ai pas besoin de vous demander la marque de fabrique, je sais que vous faites tout venir de chez Rebattet. Je dois dire que je suis plus éclectique. Pour les petits fours, pour toutes les friandises, je m’adresse souvent à Bourbonneux. Mais je reconnais qu’ils ne savent pas ce que c’est qu’une glace. Rebattet pour tout ce qui est glace bavaroise, ou sorbet, c’est le grand art. Comme dirait mon mari, le nec plus ultra. – Mais ceci est tout simplement fait ici. Vraiment non ? – Je ne pourrai pas dîner, répondait Mme Bontemps, mais je me rassieds un instant, vous savez, moi j’adore causer avec une femme intelligente comme vous. – Vous allez me trouver indiscrète, Odette, mais j’aimerais savoir comment vous jugez le chapeau qu’avait Mme Trombert. Je sais bien que la mode est aux grands chapeaux. Tout de même n’y a-t-il pas un peu d’exagération ? Et à côté de celui avec lequel elle est venue l’autre jour chez moi, celui qu’elle portait tantôt était microscopique. – Mais non, je ne suis pas intelligente, disait Odette, pensant que cela faisait bien. Je suis au fond une gobeuse, qui croit tout ce qu’on lui dit, qui se fait du chagrin pour un rien. » Et elle insinuait qu’elle avait, au commencement, beaucoup souffert d’avoir épousé un homme comme Swann qui avait une vie de son côté et qui la trompait. Cependant le prince d’Agrigente ayant entendu les mots : « Je ne suis pas intelligente », trouvait de son devoir de protester, mais il n’avait pas d’esprit de répartie. « Taratata, s’écriait Mme Bontemps, vous, pas intelligente ! – En effet je me disais : « Qu’est-ce que j’entends ? » disait le prince en saisissant cette perche. Il faut que mes oreilles m’aient trompé. – Mais non, je vous assure, disait Odette, je suis au fond une petite bourgeoise très choquable, pleine de préjugés, vivant dans son trou, surtout très ignorante. » Et pour demander des nouvelles du baron de Charlus : « Avez-vous vu cher baronet ? lui disait-elle. – Vous, ignorante, s’écriait Mme Bontemps ! Hé bien alors qu’est-ce que vous diriez du monde officiel, toutes ces femmes d’Excellences, qui ne savent parler que de chiffons !… Tenez, madame, pas plus tard qu’il y a huit jours je mets sur Lohengrin la ministresse de l’Instruction publique. Elle me répond : « Lohengrin ? Ah ! oui, la dernière revue des Folies-Bergères, il paraît que c’est tordant. » Hé bien ! madame, qu’est-ce que vous voulez, quand on entend des choses comme ça, ça vous fait bouillir. J’avais envie de la gifler. Parce que j’ai mon petit caractère vous savez. Voyons, monsieur, disait-elle en se tournant vers moi, est-ce que je n’ai pas raison ? – Écoutez, disait Mme Cottard, on est excusable de répondre un peu de travers quand on est interrogée ainsi de but en blanc, sans être prévenue. J’en sais quelque chose car Mme Verdurin a l’habitude de nous mettre ainsi le couteau sur la gorge. – À propos de Mme Verdurin, demandait Mme Bontemps à Mme Cottard, savez-vous qui il y aura mercredi chez elle ?… Ah ! je me rappelle maintenant que nous avons accepté une invitation pour mercredi prochain. Vous ne voulez pas dîner de mercredi en huit avec nous. Nous irions ensemble chez Mme Verdurin. Cela m’intimide d’entrer seule, je ne sais pas pourquoi cette grande femme m’a toujours fait peur. – Je vais vous le dire, répondait Mme Cottard, ce qui vous effraye chez Mme Verdurin, c’est son organe. Que voulez-vous ? tout le monde n’a pas un aussi joli organe que Mme Swann. Mais le temps de prendre langue, comme dit la Patronne, et la glace sera bientôt rompue. Car dans le fond elle est très accueillante. Mais je comprends très bien votre sensation, ce n’est jamais agréable de se trouver la première fois en pays perdu. – Vous pourriez aussi dîner avec nous, disait Mme Bontemps à Mme Swann. Après dîner on irait tous ensemble en Verdurin, faire Verdurin ; et même si ce devait avoir pour effet que la Patronne me fasse les gros yeux et ne m’invite plus, une fois chez elle nous resterons toutes les trois à causer entre nous, je sens que c’est ce qui m’amusera le plus. » Mais cette affirmation ne devait pas être très véridique car Mme Bontemps demandait : « Qui pensez-vous qu’il y aura de mercredi en huit ? Qu’est-ce qui se passera ? Il n’y aura pas trop de monde, au moins ? – Moi, je n’irai certainement pas, disait Odette. Nous ne ferons qu’une petite apparition au mercredi final. Si cela vous est égal d’attendre jusque-là… » Mais Mme Bontemps ne semblait pas séduite par cette proposition d’ajournement.","However Madame Bontemps, who had said a hundred times that she did not want to go to the Verdurins, delighted to be invited to the Wednesdays, was in the process of calculating how she could go there as often as possible. She did not know that Madame Verdurin wished that no one should be missed; on the other hand, she was one of those little sought-after people who, when they are invited to ""series"" by a mistress of the house, do not go to her house, like those who always know how to please, when they have a moment and the desire to go out; they, on the contrary, deprive themselves, for example, of the first and third evenings, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves for the second and fourth; unless, having learned from their information that the third will be particularly brilliant, they follow the reverse order, claiming that “unfortunately the last time they were not free”. Like Mrs. Bontemps calculated how many more Wednesdays there could be before Easter and how she would manage to have one more, without however seeming to impose herself. She counted on Madame Cottard, with whom she was to return, to give her some indications. "" Oh ! Madame Bontemps, I see you are rising, it is very wrong to give the signal to flee like this. You owe me compensation for not coming last Thursday. Come on, sit down for a moment. You won't be making another visit before dinner. You really don't allow yourself to be tempted, added Madame Swann and, holding out a plate of cakes: You know that these little filths aren't bad at all. It doesn't look like much, but taste it, you'll tell me about it. “On the contrary, it looks delicious,” replied Madame Cottard, “at home, Odette, you are never short of food. I don't need to ask you for the trademark, I know that you make everything come from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For petit fours, for all the sweets, I often go to Bourbonneux. But I recognize that they do not know what an ice cream is. Rebattet for all that is Bavarian ice cream, or sorbet, it is the great art. As my husband would say, the ultimate. – But this is simply done here. Really no? ""I won't be able to have dinner,"" replied Madame Bontemps, ""but I'll sit down for a moment, you know, I adore chatting with an intelligent woman like you. “You are going to find me indiscreet, Odette, but I would like to know how you judge the hat Madame Trombert was wearing. I know very well that the fashion is for big hats. Still, isn't that a bit of an exaggeration? And next to the one she came to my house with the other day, the one she was wearing earlier was microscopic. ""No, no, I'm not intelligent,"" said Odette, thinking it was good. I'm basically a sucker, who believes everything she's told, who worries about nothing. And she insinuated that she had, in the beginning, suffered a great deal from having married a man like Swann who had a life on his side and who cheated on her. However, the Prince of Agrigento having heard the words: ""I am not intelligent"", found it his duty to protest, but he had no spirit of repartee. ""Taratata,"" exclaimed Madame Bontemps, ""you're not intelligent!"" – In fact, I said to myself: “What do I hear? said the prince, seizing this pole. My ears must have deceived me. – But no, I assure you, said Odette, I am basically a very shocking little bourgeoise, full of prejudices, living in her hole, above all very ignorant. And to ask news of the Baron de Charlus: ""Have you seen my dear baronet?"" she told him. ""You, ignorant one,"" exclaimed Madame Bontemps! Well then, what would you say to the official world, all those women of Excellencies, who only know how to talk about rags! Minister of Public Instruction. She replies: “Lohengrin? Ah! yes, the last review of the Folies-Bergères, it seems that it is hilarious. "" Well ! Madam, what do you want, when you hear things like that, it makes you boil. I wanted to slap her. Because I have my little character you know. Come, sir, she said, turning to me, am I not right? “Listen,” Madame Cottard was saying, “one is excused for answering a little askance when one is questioned like this point-blank, without being warned. I know something about it because Madame Verdurin is used to putting a knife to our throats like this. “About Madame Verdurin,” Madame Bontemps asked Madame Cottard, “do you know who will be there on Wednesday? Ah! I remember now that we accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You don't want to dine Wednesday a week with us. We would go to Madame Verdurin's together. It intimidates me to enter alone, I don't know why this tall woman has always scared me. “I will tell you,” answered Madame Cottard, “what frightens you about Madame Verdurin is her organ. What do you want ? not everyone has as pretty an organ as Madame Swann. But the time to take language, as the Patroness says, and the ice will soon be broken. Because deep down she is very welcoming. But I understand your feeling very well, it is never pleasant to find yourself in a lost country for the first time. ""You could also dine with us,"" said Madame Bontemps to Madame Swann. After dinner we would all go together to Verdurin, to Verdurin; and even if it were to have the effect that the Patroness glared at me and didn't invite me anymore, once at her house we would stay all three to talk to each other, I feel that this is what will amuse me the most . “But this statement must not have been very true because Mrs. Bontemps asked: “Who do you think there will be Wednesday in eight? What will happen? At least there won't be too many people? ""I certainly won't go,"" said Odette. We will only make a small appearance on the final Wednesday. If you don't mind waiting until then…” But Madame Bontemps did not seem to be seduced by this proposal for adjournment.","Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins', delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not' aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they reverse the original order, assuring their hostess that ""most unfortunately, we had another engagement last week."" So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one extra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. "" Oh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday…. Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can't possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won't let yourself be tempted?"" went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, ""You know, they're not at all bad, these little horrors. They don't look nice, but just taste one , I know you'll like it."" ""On the contrary, they look quite delicious,"" broke in Mme. Cottard. ""In your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade–mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneux. But I agree that they simply don't know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they're past masters. As my husband would say, they're the ne plus ultra."" ""Oh, but we just make these in the house. You won't, really?"" ""I shan't be able to eat a scrap of dinner,"" pleaded Mme. Bontemps, ""but I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you."" ""You will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn't it just the least little bit exaggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!"" ""Oh no, I am not at all clever,"" said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. ""I am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing."" And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d'Agrigente, having caught the words ""I am not at all clever,"" thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. "" Tut, tut, tut, tut!"" cried Mme. Bontemps, ""Not clever; you!"" ""That's just what I was saying to myself—'What do I hear?' ,"" the Prince clutched at this straw, ""My ears must have played me false!"" ""No, I assure you,"" went on Odette, "" I am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant."" And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, ""Have you seen our dear Baronet? "" she asked him. ""You, ignorant!"" cried Mme. Bontemps. ""Then I wonder what you'd say of the official world, all those wives of Excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks…. Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister's wife. She stared at me, and said 'Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies–Bergères. I hear it's a perfect scream!' What do you say to that, eh? You can't help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;"" she turned to me, ""was I not right?"" ""Listen,"" said Mme. Cottard, ""people can't help answering a little off the mark when they're asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head."" ""Speaking of Mme. Verdurin,"" Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, ""do you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I've just remembered that we've accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You wouldn't care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin's. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don't know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me."" ""I'll tell you what it is,"" replied Mme. Cottard, ""what frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can't have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you've found your tongue, as the 'Mistress' says, the ice will soon be broken. For she's a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it's never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country."" ""Won't you dine with us, too?"" said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. "" After dinner we could all go to the Verdurins' together, 'do a Verdurin'; and even if it means that the 'Mistress' will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we'll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I'm sure that's what I should like best."" But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: ""Who do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won't be too big a crowd, I hope!"" ""I certainly shan't be there,"" said Odette. ""We shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don't mind waiting till then——"" But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal.","Mme Bontemps, who had declared a hundred times that she had no desire to go to the Verdurins’, was overjoyed to be invited and was wondering how she could make sure of attending as many of the Wednesdays as possible. She was unaware that Mme Verdurin’s wish was that her guests should attend every single week. Also, she was one of those people whose company is not much sought after and who, having been invited to a ‘run’ of functions by the same hostess, instead of responding like those who know they will always be welcome, and who go to her house whenever they have the opportunity and the desire to go out, decide to abstain from the first and third occasions in the belief that they will be missed, but make a point of attending the second and the fourth; or else, having been assured that the third one will be a particularly brilliant soirée, they arrange their absences in a different sequence, and then apologize by saying ‘what a pity they weren’t free last time’. So Mme Bontemps calculated how many Wednesdays there were between now and Easter and how she could manage to get herself invited to an extra one without seeming too forward. She was relying on Mme Cottard to give her some hints about this during the drive home. ‘ Oh, Mme Bontemps!’ exclaimed Mme Swann. ‘I see you’re getting to your feet! I’ll have you know it ’s very naughty of you to be giving the signal for a general withdrawal. You’ve got to make amends, don’t you know, for last Thursday when you didn’t come. So, just sit down again for a minute. I mean, your’e not going to fit in another visit between now and dinner-time, are you? No? Are you quite sure?’ she added, proffering a plate of cakes. ‘Do have one of these little chaps. They may not look like very much, but if you just try one, you’ll be very glad you did. – Mmm, they do look delicious, Mme Cottard said. One is never short of a bite to eat at your house, Odette. I don’t need to ask where these came from. I know you have your standing order at Rebattet’s. I must say I’m not as single-minded as you – for little cakes and all delicacies, I often order from Bourbonneux. But I admit they don’t really know about ices. Whereas Rebattet’s are artists when it comes to ice cream or mousses or sherbets. As my husband says, they’re just the ne plus ultra. – Well, actually, these are home-made. Are you quite sure you won’t? – No, really, said Mme Bontemps. I’ll have no appetite left for dinner. But I will sit down for a moment. I do so enjoy conversing with a woman as intelligent as yourself. Odette, you may think I’m a great gossip, but I’d love to know what you think of that hat Mme Trombert was wearing. I know that large hats are very fashionable at the moment. But doesn’t that one go a bit far? Although mind you, it’s minute compared to the one she had on the other day when she came to me. – I’m not intelligent, Odette replied, thinking this a becoming thing to say. Really, I’m quite gullible. I’m just a woman who believes whatever she’s told and who breaks her heart over a trifle.’ She insinuated that, in the early days of marriage, she had suffered much from life with a man like Swann, who had a life of his own and was unfaithful to her. The Prince d’ Agrigente, who had caught the words ‘I’m not intelligent’ and thought it behoved him to protest, was not quick-witted enough to interject. ‘Oh, come now! exclaimed Mme Bontemps. Not intelligent? You? – My sentiments exactly! the Prince said, grateful for this assistance. I was just about to say “What’s that I hear?” I must be hearing things. – No, no, I assure you, said Odette. At heart I’m really just a little middle-class housewife, easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in her small corner and very ignorant about everything.’ Then, taking care to use the English word, she asked the Prince for news of the Baron de Charlus: ‘What news of dear baronet? – Ignorant? You? exclaimed Mme Bontemps. Well, I never! If you’re ignorant, what about the world of officialdom, what about all those ministers’ wives who have nothing better to talk about than clothes! Let me tell you, Madame Swann, no more than a week ago I decided to try a mention of Lohengrin on the wife of the Minister of Education. Do you know what she said? ‘Lohengrin?’ she said. ‘Isn’t that the new revue at the Folies-Bergère? I’m told it’s hilarious.’ Believe you me, when you hear that sort of thing, it makes your blood boil! I felt like slapping her face. I don’t mind saying I’ve got a bit of a temper. Would you not agree, Monsieur? she added, turning towards me. Was I not right to feel like that? – Well, actually, said Mme Cottard, I do think one is quite within one’s rights to answer back if one is bombarded with a question like that, point blank and without warning. I know what it feels like – it’s exactly the sort of thing Mme Verdurin likes doing. – Oh, speaking of Mme Verdurin, Mme Bontemps said to her, do you know who she’s likely to be having at her Wednesday this week? Oh dear, I’ve just remembered – M. Bontemps and I have been invited somewhere else this Wednesday! What would you say to dining with us the following Wednesday? You and I could then go on together to Mme Verdurin’s. I’m rather apprehensive about turning up there all by myself. She’s such a great personage, as you know, and for some reason I’ve always been intimidated by her. – I know why that is, said Mme Cottard. It’s because of her imposing voice. I mean we can’t expect everybody to have the mellifluous tones of our Mme Swann, can we? But you’ll see, after the first moment spent sizing each other up, as the Patronne says, the ice will soon be broken. She’s really a most welcoming person. But I can understand the feeling. It’s never very nice to venture into new territory like that. – You could join us for dinner too, Mme Bontemps said to Mme Swann. Then after dinner all three of us could go and Verdurinate together, I mean Verdurinize. And if it turns out that the Patronne just glares at me and decides not to invite me again, the three of us can sit there and keep each other company. I’m sure that would be rather nice.’ Then, casting some doubt on the veracity of this, Mme Bontemps asked: ‘Who do you think she’ll be having the following Wednesday? What will she have on the programme, do you think? She wouldn’t have too many people there, would she? – Well, I for one shan’t be going, said Odette. We’ll just look in briefly at the last Wednesday of the run. If you don’t mind waiting till then …’ Mme Bontemps did not seem enraptured by this suggested adjournment."
"Malheureusement pour ma tranquillité, j’étais bien loin d’être comme tous ces gens. De beaucoup d’entre eux je me souciais ; j’aurais voulu ne pas être ignoré d’un homme au front déprimé, au regard fuyant entre les œillères de ses préjugés et de son éducation, le grand seigneur de la contrée, lequel n’était autre que le beau-frère de Legrandin, qui venait quelquefois en visite à Balbec et, le dimanche, par la garden-party hebdomadaire que sa femme et lui donnaient, dépeuplait l’hôtel d’une partie de ses habitants parce qu’un ou deux d’entre eux étaient invités à ces fêtes, et parce que les autres, pour ne pas avoir l’air de ne pas l’être, choisissaient ce jour-là pour faire une excursion éloignée. Il avait, d’ailleurs, été le premier jour fort mal reçu à l’hôtel quand le personnel, frais débarqué de la Côte d’Azur, ne savait pas encore qui il était. Non seulement il n’était pas habillé en flanelle blanche, mais par vieille manière française et ignorance de la vie des Palaces, entrant dans un hall où il y avait des femmes, il avait ôté son chapeau dès la porte, ce qui avait fait que le directeur n’avait même pas touché le sien pour lui répondre, estimant que ce devait être quelqu’un de la plus humble extraction, ce qu’il appelait un homme « sortant de l’ordinaire ». Seule la femme du notaire s’était sentie attirée vers le nouveau venu qui fleurait toute la vulgarité gourmée des gens comme il faut, et elle avait déclaré, avec le fond de discernement infaillible et d’autorité sans réplique d’une personne pour qui la première société du Mans n’a pas de secrets, qu’on se sentait devant lui en présence d’un homme d’une haute distinction, parfaitement bien élevé et qui tranchait sur tout ce qu’on rencontrait à Balbec et qu’elle jugeait infréquentable tant qu’elle ne le fréquentait pas. Ce jugement favorable qu’elle avait porté sur le beau-frère de Legrandin tenait peut-être au terne aspect de quelqu’un qui n’avait rien d’intimidant, peut-être à ce qu’elle avait reconnu dans ce gentilhomme-fermier à allure de sacristain les signes maçonniques de son propre cléricalisme.","Unfortunately for my peace of mind, I was far from being like all these people. Many of them I cared about; I would have liked not to be ignored by a man with a depressed brow, his gaze shifting between the blinders of his prejudices and his education, the great lord of the region, who was none other than Legrandin's brother-in-law, who sometimes came to visit Balbec and, on Sundays, by the weekly garden party that his wife and he gave, depopulated the hotel of a part of its inhabitants because one or two of them were invited to these parties, and because the others, so as not to look like they weren't, chose that day to make a distant excursion. He had, moreover, been very badly received the first day at the hotel when the staff, fresh from the Côte d'Azur, did not yet know who he was. Not only was he not dressed in white flannel, but out of old French fashion and ignorance of Palace life, entering a hall where there were women, he had taken off his hat at the door, which had caused the director hadn't even touched his to answer him, believing that he must be someone of the humblest extraction, what he called a man “out of the ordinary”. Only the notary's wife had felt attracted to the newcomer, who smelled of all the curt vulgarity of decent people, and she had declared, with the depth of infallible discernment and unanswerable authority of a person for whom the first company of Le Mans has no secrets, that one felt in front of him in the presence of a man of high distinction, perfectly well brought up and who decided on all that one met in Balbec and whom she judged infrequent as long as she did not frequent him. This favorable judgment she had passed on Legrandin's brother-in-law was perhaps due to the lackluster appearance of someone who was in no way intimidating, perhaps to what she had recognized in this gentleman-farmer. like a sacristan the Masonic signs of his own clericalism.","Alas for my peace of mind, I had none of the detachment that all these people shewed. To many of them I gave constant thought; I should have liked not to pass unobserved by a man with a receding brow and eyes that dodged between the blinkers of his prejudices and his education, the great nobleman of the district, who was none other than the brother–in–law of Legrandin, and came every now and then to see somebody at Balbec and on Sundays, by reason of the weekly garden–party that his wife and he gave, robbed the hotel of a large number of its occupants, because one or two of them were invited to these entertainments and the others, so as not to appear to have been not invited, chose that day for an expedition to some distant spot. He had had, as it happened, an exceedingly bad reception at the hotel on the first day of the season, when the staff, freshly imported from the Riviera, did not yet know who or what he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannels, but, with old–fashioned French courtesy and in his ignorance of the ways of smart hotels, on coming into the hall in which there were ladies sitting, he had taken off his hat at the door , the effect of which had been that the manager did not so much as raise a finger to his own in acknowledgment, concluding that this must be some one of the most humble extraction, what he called 'sprung from the ordinary.' The solicitor's wife, alone, had felt herself attracted by the stranger, who exhaled all the starched vulgarity of the really respectable, and had declared, with the unerring discernment and the indisputable authority of a person from whom the highest society of Le Mans held no secrets, that one could see at a glance that one was in the presence of a gentleman of great distinction, of perfect breeding, a striking contrast to the sort of people one usually saw at Balbec, whom she condemned as impossible to know so long as she did not know them. This favourable judgment which she had pronounced on Legrandin's brother–in–law was based perhaps on the spiritless appearance of a man about whom there was nothing to intimidate anyone; perhaps also she had recognised in this gentleman farmer with the gait of a sacristan the Masonic signs of her own inveterate clericalism.","Unfortunately for my peace of mind, I was quite unlike all these people: I was greatly concerned about many of them. I wished not to be so ignored by a man with a low forehead and a pair of shifty eyes flitting between the blinkers of his prejudices and breeding, who was the first gentleman of those parts, none other than Legrandin’s brother-in-law, who occasionally came into Balbec, and whose wife’s weekly garden-party deprived the hotel of a contingent of its inhabitants each Sunday, one or two of them because they were invited to these functions, and many others who, so as not to appear to have been excluded from them, chose that day to go on a lengthy outing. The first day he turned up at the hotel he had had a very poor reception, as the staff had only recently arrived from the Riviera and had no idea who he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannel but, unused to the ways of such grandiose establishments, he had removed his hat in his old-fashioned French manner as soon as he stepped into a vestibule with women in it, which was why the manager had not so much as tipped his to him as they spoke, in the belief that this must be someone of no social importance, what he called ‘a man of no extraction’. The only person who had viewed him with some favour was the wife of the notable notary who, sensing in him the stilted vulgarity of the prim and proper, had declared, with all the infallible and authoritative insight of one whose acuity had been acquired through long contact with the very best circles of Le Mans society, that one could see at a glance that here was a man of great distinction and impeccable breeding, a man who was a cut above everybody else one might meet at Balbec (all of whom she deemed it impossible to be seen with, until she started to be seen with them). This favourable judgment of hers on the brother-in-law of Legrandin was perhaps inspired by the drab demeanour of a man who was anything but imposing, or perhaps by the fact that in this gentleman farmer with the look of a sexton her clericalism had read the secret signs that showed he was a kindred spirit."
"Mes suffocations ayant persisté alors que ma congestion depuis longtemps finie ne les expliquait plus, mes parents firent venir en consultation le professeur Cottard. Il ne suffit pas à un médecin appelé dans des cas de ce genre d’être instruit. Mis en présence de symptômes qui peuvent être ceux de trois ou quatre maladies différentes, c’est en fin de compte son flair, son coup d’œil qui décident à laquelle, malgré les apparences à peu près semblables, il y a chance qu’il ait à faire. Ce don mystérieux n’implique pas de supériorité dans les autres parties de l’intelligence et un être d’une grande vulgarité, aimant la plus mauvaise peinture, la plus mauvaise musique, n’ayant aucune curiosité d’esprit, peut parfaitement le posséder. Dans mon cas, ce qui était matériellement observable pouvait aussi bien être causé par des spasmes nerveux, par un commencement de tuberculose, par de l’asthme, par une dyspnée toxi-alimentaire avec insuffisance rénale, par de la bronchite chronique, par un état complexe dans lequel seraient entrés plusieurs de ces facteurs. Or les spasmes nerveux demandaient à être traités par le mépris, la tuberculose par de grands soins et par un genre de suralimentation qui eût été mauvais pour un état arthritique comme l’asthme, et eût pu devenir dangereux en cas de dyspnée toxi-alimentaire laquelle exige un régime qui en revanche serait néfaste pour un tuberculeux. Mais les hésitations de Cottard furent courtes et ses prescriptions impérieuses : « Purgatifs violents et drastiques, lait pendant plusieurs jours, rien que du lait. Pas de viande, pas d’alcool. » Ma mère murmura que j’avais pourtant bien besoin d’être reconstitué, que j’étais déjà assez nerveux, que cette purge de cheval et ce régime me mettraient à bas. Je vis aux yeux de Cottard, aussi inquiets que s’il avait peur de manquer le train, qu’il se demandait s’il ne s’était pas laissé aller à sa douceur naturelle. Il tâchait de se rappeler s’il avait pensé à prendre un masque froid, comme on cherche une glace pour regarder si on n’a pas oublié de nouer sa cravate. Dans le doute et pour faire, à tout hasard, compensation, il répondit grossièrement : « Je n’ai pas l’habitude de répéter deux fois mes ordonnances. Donnez-moi une plume. Et surtout au lait. Plus tard, quand nous aurons jugulé les crises et l’agrypnie, je veux bien que vous preniez quelques potages, puis des purées, mais toujours au lait, au lait. Cela vous plaira, puisque l’Espagne est à la mode, ollé ! ollé ! (Ses élèves connaissaient bien ce calembour qu’il faisait à l’hôpital chaque fois qu’il mettait un cardiaque ou un hépatique au régime lacté.) Ensuite vous reviendrez progressivement à la vie commune. Mais chaque fois que la toux et les étouffements recommenceront, purgatifs, lavages intestinaux, lit, lait. » Il écouta d’un air glacial, sans y répondre, les dernières objections de ma mère, et, comme il nous quitta sans avoir daigné expliquer les raisons de ce régime, mes parents le jugèrent sans rapport avec mon cas, inutilement affaiblissant et ne me le firent pas essayer. Ils cherchèrent naturellement à cacher au professeur leur désobéissance, et pour y réussir plus sûrement, évitèrent toutes les maisons où ils auraient pu le rencontrer. Puis, mon état s’aggravant, on se décida à me faire suivre à la lettre les prescriptions de Cottard ; au bout de trois jours je n’avais plus de râles, plus de toux et je respirais bien. Alors nous comprîmes que Cottard, tout en me trouvant, comme il le dit dans la suite, assez asthmatique et surtout « toqué », avait discerné que ce qui prédominait à ce moment-là en moi, c’était l’intoxication, et qu’en faisant couler mon foie et en lavant mes reins, il décongestionnerait mes bronches, me rendrait le souffle, le sommeil, les forces. Et nous comprîmes que cet imbécile était un grand clinicien. Je pus enfin me lever. Mais on parlait de ne plus m’envoyer aux Champs-Élysées. On disait que c’était à cause du mauvais air ; je pensais bien qu’on profitait du prétexte pour que je ne pusse plus voir Mlle Swann et je me contraignais à redire tout le temps le nom de Gilberte, comme ce langage natal que les vaincus s’efforcent de maintenir pour ne pas oublier la patrie qu’ils ne reverront pas. Quelquefois ma mère passait sa main sur mon front en me disant :","My suffocations having persisted even though my congestion, long gone, no longer explained them, my parents called in Professor Cottard for a consultation. It is not enough for a doctor called in cases of this kind to be educated. Faced with symptoms which may be those of three or four different illnesses, it is ultimately his flair, his glance which decides which, despite the roughly similar appearances, there is a chance that he has to do. This mysterious gift does not imply superiority in the other parts of the intelligence and a being of great vulgarity, liking the worst painting, the worst music, having no curiosity of mind, can perfectly possess it. . In my case, what was materially observable could just as well be caused by nervous spasms, by the onset of tuberculosis, by asthma, by food-toxic dyspnea with renal insufficiency, by chronic bronchitis, by a state complex into which several of these factors would have entered. Nervous spasms demanded to be treated with contempt, tuberculosis with great care and with a kind of overeating which would have been bad for an arthritic state like asthma, and could have become dangerous in the case of toxi-alimentary dyspnea which requires a diet which, on the other hand, would be harmful for a tuberculosis patient. But Cottard's hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious: “Violent and drastic purgatives, milk for several days, nothing but milk. No meat, no alcohol. My mother muttered that I needed to be put together again, that I was nervous enough already, that this horse purge and this diet would bring me down. I saw in Cottard's eyes, as worried as if he were afraid of missing the train, that he was wondering if he hadn't given way to his natural gentleness. He tried to remember if he had thought of taking a cold mask, as one looks for a mirror to see if one has not forgotten to tie one's tie. When in doubt and just in case, to make up for it, he rudely replied: “I am not in the habit of repeating my prescriptions twice. Give me a feather. And especially milk. Later, when we've gotten the seizures and the agripnia under control, I'm quite willing for you to have some soups, then purées, but always with milk, with milk. You will like it, since Spain is in fashion, ollé! ol! (His students were well acquainted with the pun he made in the hospital each time he put a cardiac or hepatic patient on a milk diet.) Then you will gradually return to common life. But each time the coughing and choking begin again, purgatives, bowel washes, bed, milk. He listened with an icy air, without answering them, to my mother's last objections, and, as he left us without having deigned to explain the reasons for this diet, my parents judged him to be irrelevant to my case, unnecessarily weakening and not didn't make me try it. They naturally sought to hide their disobedience from the professor, and to succeed more surely, avoided all the houses where they could have met him. Then, my condition worsening, they decided to make me follow Cottard's prescriptions to the letter; after three days I had no more rales, no more cough and I was breathing well. Then we understood that Cottard, while finding me, as he says later, rather asthmatic and above all ""crazy"", had discerned that what predominated in me at that moment was intoxication, and that 'by making my liver flow and washing my kidneys, it would decongest my bronchial tubes, restore my breath, my sleep, my strength. And we understood that this idiot was a great clinician. I was finally able to get up. But there was talk of no longer sending me to the Champs-Élysées. They said it was because of the bad air; I really thought that they were taking advantage of the pretext so that I could no longer see Mlle. Swann and I forced myself to repeat Gilberte's name all the time, like that native language that the vanquished strive to maintain so as not to forget their country. that they will not see again. Sometimes my mother passed her hand over my forehead saying:","As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a toxi–alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a 'feeding–up' process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxi–alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard's hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. "" Purges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol. "" My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be 'built up,' that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard's eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good–humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one's tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: ""I am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You'll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; ollé, ollé!"" His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. "" After that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking—purges, injections, bed, milk!"" He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother's final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard's prescriptions to the letter; in three days my 'rattle' and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to 'imagine things,' had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs–Elysées. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a pretext so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: ""So little boys don't tell Mamma their troubles any more?""","When my attacks of breathlessness went on inexplicably, long after my pleurisy had cleared up, my parents called in Dr Cottard. A doctor consulted in a case like this must be more than just well versed. In the face of symptoms which may be those of three or four different illnesses, the thing that enables him to decide which of them he is most likely to be dealing with, behind appearances which are very similar, is ultimately his flair, the sharpness of his eye. This mysterious gift implies no superiority in other aspects of the mind, and may be found even in a person of the utmost vulgarity, someone who is devoid of intellectual curiosity and who enjoys the most dreadful painting or music. In my case, what was externally observable might have been caused by nervous spasms, the early stages of tuberculosis, asthma, a toxi-alimentary dyspnœea with renal insufficiency, chronic bronchitis or even a complex condition comprising several of these factors. The nervous spasms needed to be treated with disdain, the tuberculosis with great care and a form of over-nutrition, which could have been bad for an arthritic condition like asthma, and possibly dangerous for a toxi-alimentary dyspnœea, which in its turn requires a regimen quite harmful to a patient suffering from tuberculosis. But Dr Cottard barely hesitated before issuing the imperious command: ‘Drastic, violent purgatives. Milk and nothing but milk for several days. No meat. No alcohol.’ My mother murmured that I really needed building up, that I was highly strung enough as it was, that this draconian purging and such a regimen would be hard on me. From Dr Cottard’s eyes, which looked as anxious as though he was afraid of missing a train, I could see he was wondering whether he might not have behaved with his natural mildness of manner. He was trying to remember whether he had made sure of putting on his mask of frigidity, the way one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not neglected to knot one’s tie. In this uncertainty, and so as to compensate just in case, he barked rudely, ‘I am not in the habit of repeating my prescriptions. Get me a pen. Milk, milk, that’s the main thing. After a while, once we’ve dealt with the breathless attacks and the insomnia, we can start taking some clear soup, then some broth, but always and still with milk in – milk, that’s the thing! You’ll like that, because Spain is fashionable these days – olé! au lait!27 (His students were familiar with this pun, which he trotted out whenever he prescribed a milk diet for a cardiac case or a patient with a liver disorder.) Then we can gradually come back to the ordinary family diet. But if ever the cough and the breathlessness come back, purgatives, enemas, bed and milk!’ With an icy demeanour, he heard out my mother’s final objections, saying nothing in return, then took his leave without so much as a word to explain why he had chosen this treatment. My parents, taking the view that it was irrelevant to my condition and needlessly debilitating, decided not to try it. They naturally sought to keep the Professor in ignorance of their lack of compliance; and to make sure of this, they stayed away from any of the houses where they might have run the risk of meeting him. Then, my condition having worsened, they decided to follow Dr Cottard’s instructions to the letter: three days later, all the rattling in my chest had gone, my cough had cleared up and I could breathe properly. We came to understand that Cottard, though, as he said later, he had thought I was asthmatic and especially ‘not quite right in the head’, had seen clearly that what predominated in me at that moment was a toxic reaction, that the liver and kidneys had therefore to be washed out, thus decongesting the bronchial tubes and enabling me to breathe and sleep again, and regain my strength. So it was we realized that Cottard the buffoon was a great doctor. At length I was able to get up. But the talk now was of not allowing me to go back to the Champs-Élysées. The reason given was the unhealthy air. But I was sure this was just an excuse for them to keep me away from Mlle Swann; and I made myself say over and over the name of Gilberte, as though it was a native tongue and I one of those captives in exile who endeavour to keep it alive, so as not to forget the homeland they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead and say:"
* * *,* * *,"Seascape, With Frieze of Girls","Or if I had been out all evening with Saint-Loup, and came back to the hotel enjoying the prospect of being with her again and giving her a kiss, I would wait in vain for her little knocks on the wall, which were her invitation to me to go in and kiss her goodnight; I would get into bed, a little resentful at this unfamiliar indifference in her, at her way of depriving me of a pleasure which I had been much looking forward to; and with my heart throbbing as much as it had ever done when I was a child, I would lie there listening to the silence of the wall, until sleep came to dry my tears."
"Je dois du reste dire que cette insignifiance où tombaient les choses les plus graves, par contraste avec la violence de mon exaltation, finissait par comprendre même Mlle Simonet et ses amies. L’entreprise de les connaître me semblait maintenant facile mais indifférente, car ma sensation présente seule, grâce à son extraordinaire puissance, à la joie que provoquaient ses moindres modifications et même sa simple continuité, avait de l’importance pour moi ; tout le reste, parents, travail, plaisirs, jeunes filles de Balbec, ne pesait pas plus qu’un flocon d’écume dans un grand vent qui ne le laisse pas se poser, n’existait plus que relativement à cette puissance intérieure ; l’ivresse réalise pour quelques heures l’idéalisme subjectif, le phénoménisme pur ; tout n’est plus qu’apparences et n’existe plus qu’en fonction de notre sublime nous-même. Ce n’est pas, du reste, qu’un amour véritable, si nous en avons un, ne puisse subsister dans un semblable état. Mais nous sentons si bien, comme dans un milieu nouveau, que des pressions inconnues ont changé les dimensions de ce sentiment que nous ne pouvons pas le considérer pareillement. Ce même amour, nous le retrouvons bien, mais déplacé, ne pesant plus sur nous, satisfait de la sensation que lui accorde le présent et qui nous suffit, car de ce qui n’est pas actuel nous ne nous soucions pas. Malheureusement le coefficient qui change ainsi les valeurs ne les change que dans cette heure d’ivresse. Les personnes qui n’avaient plus d’importance et sur lesquelles nous soufflions comme sur des bulles de savon reprendront le lendemain leur densité ; il faudra essayer de nouveau de se remettre aux travaux qui ne signifiaient plus rien. Chose plus grave encore, cette mathématique du lendemain, la même que celle d’hier et avec les problèmes de laquelle nous nous retrouverons inexorablement aux prises, c’est celle qui nous régit même pendant ces heures-là, sauf pour nous-même. S’il se trouve près de nous une femme vertueuse ou hostile, cette chose si difficile la veille – à savoir, que nous arrivions à lui plaire – nous semble maintenant un million de fois plus aisée sans l’être devenue en rien, car ce n’est qu’à nos propres yeux, à nos propres yeux intérieurs que nous avons changé. Et elle est aussi mécontente à l’instant même que nous nous soyons permis une familiarité que nous le serons le lendemain d’avoir donné cent francs au chasseur, et pour la même raison qui pour nous a été seulement retardée : l’absence d’ivresse.","I must say, moreover, that this insignificance into which the most serious things fell, in contrast to the violence of my exaltation, ended by including even Mademoiselle Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them now seemed easy but indifferent to me, for my present sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary power, to the joy which its slightest modifications and even its simple continuity provoked, had importance for me; all the rest, parents, work, pleasures, young girls from Balbec, weighed no more than a flake of foam in a high wind that does not let it rest, only existed relative to this inner power; intoxication realizes for a few hours subjective idealism, pure phenomenalism; everything is only appearances and only exists according to our sublime ourselves. It is not, moreover, that a true love, if we have one, cannot subsist in such a state. But we feel so well, as in a new environment, that unknown pressures have changed the dimensions of this feeling that we cannot consider it the same way. This same love, we find it well, but moved, no longer weighing on us, satisfied with the sensation that the present gives it and which is enough for us, because of what is not current we do not care. Unfortunately, the coefficient which thus changes the values only changes them in this hour of intoxication. The people who were no longer important and on whom we blew like soap bubbles will resume their density the next day; we will have to try again to get back to the work that no longer meant anything. Even more serious, this mathematics of tomorrow, the same as that of yesterday and with the problems with which we will find ourselves inexorably grappling, is the one that governs us even during these hours, except for ourselves. If there is near us a virtuous or hostile woman, this thing so difficult the day before - namely, that we manage to please her - now seems to us a million times easier without having become so in any way, because this It is only in our own eyes, in our own inner eyes that we have changed. And she is as displeased at the very moment that we allowed ourselves a familiarity as we will be the next day at having given a hundred francs to the hunter, and for the same reason which for us was only delayed: the absence of drunkenness.","I ought here to add that this insignificance into which the most serious matters subsided, by contrast with the violence of my exaltation, came in the end to include Mlle. Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them seemed to me easy now but hardly worth the trouble, for my immediate sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary intensity, to the joy that its slightest modifications, its mere continuity provoked, had any importance for me; all the rest—parents, work, pleasures, girls at Balbec weighed with me no more than does a flake of foam in a strong wind that will not let it find a resting place, existed no longer save in relation to this internal power: intoxication makes real for an hour or two a subjective idealism, pure phenomenism; nothing is left now but appearances, nothing exists save as a function of our sublime self. This is not to say that a genuine love, if we have one, cannot survive in such conditions. But we feel so unmistakably, as though in a new atmosphere, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of that sentiment that we can no longer consider it in the old way. It is indeed still there and we shall find it, but in a different place, no longer weighing upon us, satisfied by the sensation which the present affords it, a sensation that is sufficient for us, since for what is not actually present we take no thought. Unfortunately the coefficient which thus alters our values alters them only in the hour of intoxication. The people who had lost all their importance, whom we scattered with our breath like soap–bubbles, will to–morrow resume their density; we shall have to try afresh to settle down to work which this evening had ceased to have any significance. A more serious matter still, these mathematics of the morrow, the same as those of yesterday, in whose problems we shall find ourselves inexorably involved, it is they that govern us even in these hours, and we alone are unconscious of their rule. If there should happen to be, near us, a woman, virtuous or inimical, that question so difficult an hour ago—to know whether we should succeed in finding favour with her—seems to us now a million times easier of solution without having become easier in any respect, for it is only in our own sight, in our own inward sight, that we have altered. And she is as much annoyed with us at this moment as we shall be next day at the thought of our having given a hundred francs to the messenger, and for the same reason which in our case has merely been delayed in its operation, namely the absence of intoxication.","It must be added that the insignificance which came over all serious things in the face of my intense exhilaration eventually affected even Mlle Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of getting to know them now seemed easy, but a matter of indifference, since nothing but my present sensation, because of the extraordinary power of it, the euphoria afforded by its slightest variations and even by the mere continuity of it, had any importance; everything else, my parents, my work, my pleasures, my gang of girls at Balbec, was reduced to the insubstantiality of a fleck of spray in the high wind which prevents it from coming to earth, and had no existence except in so far as it related to my sensation of power: drunkenness brings about, for the space of a few hours, subjective idealism, pure phenomenalism; all things become mere appearances, and exist only as a function of our sublime selves. This does not mean that genuine love, if we happen to have such a feeling, cannot survive in these conditions. But we are well aware, as though we had moved into a new element, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of our feeling, and we can no longer consider it as we did before. We know it is still there somewhere, but it has shifted, it no longer weighs on us, it is satisfied with the sensation afforded it by the present, a sensation which satisfies us too, for we have no interest in anything that is not the present. Unfortunately, the coefficient which alters values in this way works only during the hour of drunkenness. Tomorrow the individuals who had become insignificant, whom we blew away like soap-bubbles, will again take on their full density; and the work left undone, but which had lost all meaning, will have to be faced once more. Even more seriously, these morning-after mathematics, which are no different from day-before mathematics, are not only the making of the unavoidable problems which we must still contend with, they are also the mathematics which, unknown to ourselves, have in fact been governing our life during the drunken hours. If at those moments we are with a woman whose virtue or unfriendliness made her inaccessible, what was implausible the day before (that she should be attracted to us) now seems a million times easier, although it has not become any easier in fact, it being only in our eyes, our inner view of ourself, that we have changed. At the moment when we take a little liberty with her, she is as displeased as we will be the morning after, when we remember having tipped the porter 100 francs, and for the same reason, which for us has simply been delayed: the fact of not being drunk."
"C’était, non plus avec des membres de sa famille, mais avec certains écrivains de son temps que d’autres traits de son élocution lui étaient communs. De plus jeunes qui commençaient à le renier et prétendaient n’avoir aucune parenté intellectuelle avec lui, la manifestaient sans le vouloir en employant les mêmes adverbes, les mêmes prépositions qu’il répétait sans cesse, en construisant les phrases de la même manière, en parlant sur le même ton amorti, ralenti, par réaction contre le langage éloquent et facile d’une génération précédente. Peut-être ces jeunes gens – on en verra qui étaient dans ce cas – n’avaient-ils pas connu Bergotte. Mais sa façon de penser, inoculée en eux, y avait développé ces altérations de la syntaxe et de l’accent qui sont en relation nécessaire avec l’originalité intellectuelle. Relation qui demande à être interprétée d’ailleurs. Ainsi Bergotte, s’il ne devait rien à personne dans sa façon d’écrire, tenait sa façon de parler d’un de ses vieux camarades, merveilleux causeur dont il avait subi l’ascendant, qu’il imitait sans le vouloir dans la conversation, mais qui, lui, étant moins doué, n’avait jamais écrit de livres vraiment supérieurs. De sorte que si l’on s’en était tenu à l’originalité du débit, Bergotte eût été étiqueté disciple, écrivain de seconde main, alors que, influencé par son ami dans le domaine de la causerie, il avait été original et créateur comme écrivain. Sans doute encore pour se séparer de la précédente génération, trop amie des abstractions, des grands lieux communs, quand Bergotte voulait dire du bien d’un livre, ce qu’il faisait valoir, ce qu’il citait c’était toujours quelque scène faisant image, quelque tableau sans signification rationnelle. « Ah ! si ! disait-il, c’est bien ! il y a une petite fille en châle orange, ah ! c’est bien », ou encore : « Oh ! oui, il y a un passage où il y a un régiment qui traverse la ville, ah ! oui, c’est bien ! » Pour le style, il n’était pas tout à fait de son temps (et restait du reste fort exclusivement de son pays, il détestait Tolstoï, George Eliot, Ibsen et Dostoïewski) car le mot qui revenait toujours quand il voulait faire l’éloge d’un style, c’était le mot « doux ». « Si, j’aime, tout de même mieux le Chateaubriand d’Atala que celui de René, il me semble que c’est plus doux. » Il disait ce mot-là comme un médecin à qui un malade assure que le lait lui fait mal à l’estomac et qui répond : « C’est pourtant bien doux. » Et il est vrai qu’il y avait dans le style de Bergotte une sorte d’harmonie pareille à celle pour laquelle les anciens donnaient à certains de leurs orateurs des louanges dont nous concevons difficilement la nature, habitués que nous sommes à nos langues modernes où on ne cherche pas ce genre d’effets.","It was no longer with members of his family, but with certain writers of his time that other features of his speech were common to him. Younger people who began to deny him and claimed to have no intellectual kinship with him showed it unwittingly by using the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he repeated constantly, by constructing sentences in the same way, by speaking in the same muted, slowed tone, in reaction to the eloquent, easy language of a previous generation. Perhaps these young people – we will see who were in this case – had not known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had developed there those alterations of syntax and accent which are necessarily related to intellectual originality. A relationship that requires interpretation. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to anyone in his way of writing, inherited his way of speaking from one of his old comrades, a marvelous conversationalist whose ascendancy he had suffered, whom he unwittingly imitated in the conversation, but who, being less gifted, had never written truly superior books. So that if we had stuck to the originality of delivery, Bergotte would have been labeled a disciple, a second-hand writer, whereas, influenced by his friend in the field of conversation, he had been original and creative. as a writer. Doubtless still to separate themselves from the previous generation, too fond of abstractions, of grand platitudes, when Bergotte wanted to speak well of a book, what he was promoting, what he was quoting was always some scene making an image, some picture without rational meaning. “Oh! if ! he said, it's good! there is a little girl in an orange shawl, ah! that’s good”, or even: “Oh! yes, there is a passage where there is a regiment crossing the town, ah! Yes it's good ! In terms of style, he was not quite up to date (and moreover remained very exclusively from his country, he hated Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoyewsky) because the word that always came up when he wanted to do the praise of a style was the word ""gentle"". ""Yes, I still like Atala's Chateaubriand better than René's, it seems to me that it's sweeter. He said that word like a doctor to whom a patient assures him that the milk hurts his stomach and who replies: ""It's very sweet, however."" And it is true that there was in Bergotte's style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients gave to some of their orators praises the nature of which we hardly conceive, accustomed as we are to our modern languages. where we are not looking for this kind of effects.","But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men—we shall come across some of whom this may be said—had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second–hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. "" Ah, yes!"" he would exclaim, ""it is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is excellent!"" or again, ""Oh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is excellent!"" As for style, he was not altogether of his time (though he remained quite exclusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky), for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was 'mild.' "" Yes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atala than in René; he seems to me to be 'milder.'"" He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, ""But, you know, it's very 'mild'. "" And it is true that there was in Bergotte's style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought.","Other features of his diction he shared not with members of his family but with certain writers of his day. Certain younger writers who were beginning to outgrow him, and who claimed to have no intellectual affinity with him, showed their debt to him unawares in their use of certain adverbs or prepositions which he was always using, in the sentences they spoke modelled on his, in the same dawdling and almost toneless manner of speech, which had been his reaction against the facile grandiloquence of a previous generation. It may be that these young men had never known Bergotte (this was certainly the case, as will be seen, with some of them). But having been inoculated with his way of thinking, they had developed those modifications of syntax and accent which bear a necessary relation to intellectual originality. This is a relation which requires some interpretation. The fact was that, though Bergotte’s way of writing owed nothing to anyone, he was indebted for his speaking style to one of his old friends, a wonderful talker who had had a great influence on him, whom he imitated unintentionally in conversation but who, being less gifted than Bergotte, had never written a book that was in any way out of the ordinary. Thus, if judged only on originality of spoken delivery, Bergotte would have been properly deemed to be a mere disciple, a purveyor of hand-me-downs; whereas, despite having been influenced in speech-habits by his friend, he had still been original and creative as a writer. His impulse to set himself apart from that previous generation, which had been too fond of grand abstractions and commonplaces, could probably also be seen in the fact that when he wanted to praise a book, the thing he would single out or quote was always a scene giving a graphic glimpse of something, a picture without thematic relevance. ‘ Oh, yes, he would say. That’s pretty good. That little girl wearing the orange shawl. It’s really nice.’ Or else, ‘Yes, that’s right! That part where there’s a regiment marching through a town! Yes, that’s a good bit!’ On matters of style, he was not quite of his own period (though very much of his own country, abhorring Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoevsky); and the word one always heard from him whenever he praised a writer’s style was ‘smooth’: ‘Well, actually the Chateaubriand I prefer is the one in Atala rather than the one in Rancé – yes, he’s smoother there.’ He used the word as a doctor might to soothe a patient complaining that milk was not good for his stomach: ‘Oh, but it’s very smooth.’ And it is a fact that in his own style there was a type of harmony, the like of which made the ancients praise some of their orators in ways which seem all but inconceivable to us, accustomed as we are to our modern languages, in which no one would try for such effects."

"Françoise ne se trompait pas moins sur Saint-Loup quand elle disait qu’il avait l’air comme ça de ne pas dédaigner le peuple, mais que ce n’est pas vrai et qu’il n’y avait qu’à le voir quand il était en colère après son cocher. Il était arrivé en effet quelquefois à Robert de le gronder avec une certaine rudesse, qui prouvait chez lui moins le sentiment de la différence que de l’égalité entre les classes. « Mais, me dit-il en réponse aux reproches que je lui faisais d’avoir traité un peu durement ce cocher, pourquoi affecterais-je de lui parler poliment ? N’est-il pas mon égal ? N’est-il pas aussi près de moi que mes oncles ou mes cousins ? Vous avez l’air de trouver que je devrais le traiter avec égards, comme un inférieur ! Vous parlez comme un aristocrate », ajouta-t-il avec dédain.","Françoise was no less mistaken about Saint-Loup when she said that he seemed like that not to disdain the people, but that it is not true and that one had only to see him. when he was angry with his coachman. It had indeed sometimes happened to Robert to scold him with a certain harshness, which proved in him less the feeling of difference than of equality between the classes. “But,” he said to me, in answer to my reproaches for having treated this coachman a little harshly, “why should I affect to speak to him politely? Is he not my equal? Is he not as close to me as my uncles or my cousins? You seem to think I should treat him with respect, as an inferior! You talk like an aristocrat,” he added dismissively.","Françoise was no less mistaken about Saint– Loup when she complained that he had that sort of air, as if he did not look down upon the people, but that it was all just a pretence, and you had only to see him when he was in a temper with his groom. It had indeed sometimes happened that Robert would scold his groom with a certain amount of brutality, which proved that he had the sense not so much of the difference as of the equality between classes and masses. "" But,"" he said in answer to my rebuke of his having treated the man rather harshly, ""why should I go out of my way to speak politely to him? Isn't he my equal? Isn't he just as near to me as any of my uncles and cousins? You seem to think that I ought to treat him with respect, as an inferior. You talk like an aristocrat!"" he added scornfully.","Françoise was equally mistaken when she said of Saint-Loup that he ‘just looked as though he didn’t look down on people beneath him’, but that this was really untrue: you only had to see the way he got angry with his coachman. Robert, it was true, had more than once had occasion to speak rather severely to the man; but that, rather than a proof of any consciousness of class-distinction, was a proof of his belief in equality between the classes. ‘But look here,’ he said, when I reproached him for having treated his coachman harshly, ‘why should I affect to speak politely to the fellow? Are we not equals? Is he not as close to me as my uncles and my cousins? You seem to suggest that I should handle him with care, like an inferior!’ And he added disdainfully, ‘You’re speaking like an aristocrat.’"
"Si j’avais été moins décidé à me mettre définitivement au travail, j’aurais peut-être fait un effort pour commencer tout de suite. Mais puisque ma résolution était formelle, et qu’avant vingt-quatre heures, dans les cadres vides de la journée du lendemain où tout se plaçait si bien parce que je n’y étais pas encore, mes bonnes dispositions se réaliseraient aisément, il valait mieux ne pas choisir un soir où j’étais mal disposé pour un début auquel les jours suivants, hélas ! ne devaient pas se montrer plus propices. Mais j’étais raisonnable. De la part de qui avait attendu des années, il eût été puéril de ne pas supporter un retard de trois jours. Certain que le surlendemain j’aurais déjà écrit quelques pages, je ne disais plus un seul mot à mes parents de ma décision ; j’aimais mieux patienter quelques heures, et apporter à ma grand’mère consolée et convaincue, de l’ouvrage en train. Malheureusement le lendemain n’était pas cette journée extérieure et vaste que j’avais attendue dans la fièvre. Quand il était fini, ma paresse et ma lutte pénible contre certains obstacles internes avaient simplement duré vingt-quatre heures de plus. Et au bout de quelques jours, mes plans n’ayant pas été réalisés, je n’avais plus le même espoir qu’ils le seraient immédiatement, partant, plus autant de courage pour subordonner tout à cette réalisation : je recommençais à veiller, n’ayant plus pour m’obliger à me coucher de bonne heure un soir, la vision certaine de voir l’œuvre commencée le lendemain matin. Il me fallait avant de reprendre mon élan quelques jours de détente, et la seule fois où ma grand’mère osa d’un ton doux et désenchanté formuler ce reproche : « Hé bien, ce travail, on n’en parle même plus ? » je lui en voulus, persuadé que, n’ayant pas su voir que mon parti était irrévocablement pris, elle venait d’en ajourner encore et pour longtemps peut-être, l’exécution, par l’énervement que son déni de justice me causait et sous l’empire duquel je ne voudrais pas commencer mon œuvre. Elle sentit que son scepticisme venait de heurter à l’aveugle une volonté. Elle s’en excusa, me dit en m’embrassant : « Pardon, je ne dirai plus rien. » Et pour que je ne me décourageasse pas, m’assura que du jour où je serais bien portant, le travail viendrait tout seul par surcroît.","If I had been less determined to definitely get to work, I might have made an effort to start right away. But since my resolution was formal, and before twenty-four hours, in the empty frames of the next day where everything was going so well because I was not there yet, my good intentions would be easily realized, it was worth better not to choose an evening when I was ill-disposed for a start to which the following days, alas! should not prove more propitious. But I was reasonable. From someone who had waited for years, it would have been childish not to endure a delay of three days. Certain that two days later I would have already written a few pages, I no longer said a single word to my parents about my decision; I preferred to wait a few hours and bring my grandmother, consoled and convinced, some work in progress. Unfortunately the next day was not that vast exterior day that I had feverishly awaited. When it was over, my laziness and painful struggle against certain internal obstacles had simply lasted another twenty-four hours. And after a few days, my plans not having been realized, I no longer had the same hope that they would be immediately, therefore, no longer as much courage to subordinate everything to this realization: I began to watch again, n having more to compel me to go to bed early one evening, the certain vision of seeing the work begun the next morning. Before resuming my momentum, I needed a few days of relaxation, and the only time my grandmother dared, in a soft and disenchanted tone, to reproach her: “Well, this work, we don’t even talk about it anymore? I was angry with her, convinced that, not having been able to see that my decision was irrevocably taken, she had just postponed the execution of it again and for a long time perhaps, by the nervousness that her denial of justice caused me. was talking about and under whose influence I would not want to begin my work. She felt that her skepticism had just struck a blind will. She apologized, said to me, kissing me: ""Excuse me, I won't say anything more. And so that I wouldn't get discouraged, assured me that the day I was in good health, work would come on its own as well.","Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty–four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill–disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after next I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, external day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty–four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of relaxation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: "" Well, and that work of yours; aren't we even to speak of it now?"" I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: ""I am sorry; I shall not say anything again,"" and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength.","If I had not been so determined to set seriously to work, I might have made an effort to start at once. But given that my resolve was unbreakable, given that within twenty-four hours, inside the empty frame of tomorrow where everything fitted so perfectly because it was not today, my best intentions would easily take material shape, it was really preferable not to think of beginning things on an evening when I was not quite ready – and of course the following days were to be no better suited to beginning things. However, I was a reasonable person. When one has waited for years, it would be childish not to tolerate a delay of a couple of days. In the knowledge that by the day after tomorrow I would have several pages written, I said no more about my decision to the family: much better to wait for a few hours, then once I had a piece of work in progress to show, my grandmother would be consoled and convinced. Unfortunately, tomorrow turned out not to be that broad, bright, outward-looking day that I had feverishly looked forward to. When it had ended, my idleness and hard struggle against my inner obstacles had just lasted for another twenty-four hours. After a few days, when my projects had still not come to anything, when some of my hope that they would very soon come to something had faded, and with it some of the courage I required in order to subordinate everything to my coming achievement, I went back to staying up late, as I now also lacked my incentive (the certain knowledge that the great work would be begun by the following morning) to go to bed early on any given evening. Before regaining my impetus, I was in need of a respite of several days; and on the only occasion when my grandmother hazarded a reproach in a tone of mild disenchantment – ‘So is anything happening about this writing?’ – I was aggrieved at her, and I concluded that, by her inability to see the staunchness of my purpose, by the anguish which her gross unfairness caused me, an utterly unsuitable state of mind in which to undertake such a work as mine, she had just succeeded in putting off once again (and possibly for a long time!) the moment when its accomplishing would be begun. She sensed that her sceptical air had offended an unsuspected but genuine resolve. She apologized with a kiss: ‘I’m sorry. I won’t say another word about it.’ So that I would not lose heart, she added her assurance that a day would come when I would feel well again, and that, of its own accord, my work would then start to flow smoothly."
"Je rentrai parce que je devais aller dîner à Rivebelle avec Robert et que ma grand’mère exigeait qu’avant de partir, je m’étendisse ces soirs-là pendant une heure sur mon lit, sieste que le médecin de Balbec m’ordonna bientôt d’étendre à tous les autres soirs.","I came home because I had to go to dinner at Rivebelle with Robert and my grandmother demanded that before leaving I lay down on my bed for an hour on those evenings, a siesta that the doctor at Balbec soon ordered me to do. to extend to all other evenings.","I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also.","I had to go back to the hotel, as Robert and I were going out to dinner at Rivebelle and my grandmother insisted that, on such occasions, I take an hour’s rest on my bed, a siesta which the Balbec doctor soon ordered me to extend to all other evenings as well."
"Mais d’ailleurs le portrait eût-il été, non pas antérieur, comme la photographie préférée de Swann, à la systématisation des traits d’Odette en un type nouveau, majestueux et charmant, mais postérieur, qu’il eût suffi de la vision d’Elstir pour désorganiser ce type. Le génie artistique agit à la façon de ces températures extrêmement élevées qui ont le pouvoir de dissocier les combinaisons d’atomes et de grouper ceux-ci suivant un ordre absolument contraire, répondant à un autre type. Toute cette harmonie factice que la femme a imposée à ses traits et dont chaque jour avant de sortir elle surveille la persistance dans sa glace, chargeant l’inclinaison du chapeau, le lissage des cheveux, l’enjouement du regard, afin d’en assurer la continuité, cette harmonie, le coup d’œil du grand peintre la détruit en une seconde, et à sa place il fait un regroupement des traits de la femme, de manière à donner satisfaction à un certain idéal féminin et pictural qu’il porte en lui. De même, il arrive souvent qu’à partir d’un certain âge, l’œil d’un grand chercheur trouve partout les éléments nécessaires à établir les rapports qui seuls l’intéressent. Comme ces ouvriers et ces joueurs qui ne font pas d’embarras et se contentent de ce qui leur tombe sous la main, ils pourraient dire de n’importe quoi : cela fera l’affaire. Ainsi une cousine de la princesse de Luxembourg, beauté des plus altières, s’étant éprise autrefois d’un art qui était nouveau à cette époque, avait demandé au plus grand des peintres naturalistes de faire son portrait. Aussitôt l’œil de l’artiste avait trouvé ce qu’il cherchait partout. Et sur la toile il y avait à la place de la grande dame un trottin, et derrière lui un vaste décor incliné et violet qui faisait penser à la place Pigalle. Mais même sans aller jusque-là, non seulement le portrait d’une femme par un grand artiste ne cherchera aucunement à donner satisfaction à quelques-unes des exigences de la femme – comme celles qui, par exemple, quand elle commence à vieillir, la font se faire photographier dans des tenues presque de fillette qui font valoir sa taille restée jeune et la font paraître comme la sœur ou même la fille de sa fille, celle-ci au besoin « fagotée » pour la circonstance, à côté d’elle – et mettra au contraire en relief les désavantages qu’elle cherche à cacher et qui, comme un teint fiévreux, voire verdâtre, le tentent d’autant plus parce qu’ils ont du « caractère » ; mais ils suffisent à désenchanter le spectateur vulgaire et réduisent pour lui en miettes l’idéal dont la femme soutenait si fièrement l’armature et qui la plaçait dans sa forme unique, irréductible, si en dehors, si au-dessus du reste de l’humanité. Maintenant déchue, située hors de son propre type où elle trônait invulnérable, elle n’est plus qu’une femme quelconque en la supériorité de qui nous avons perdu toute foi. Ce type, nous faisions tellement consister en lui, non seulement la beauté d’une Odette, mais sa personnalité, son identité, que devant le portrait qui l’a dépouillée de lui, nous sommes tentés de nous écrier non pas seulement : « Comme c’est enlaidi », mais : « Comme c’est peu ressemblant. » Nous avons peine à croire que ce soit elle. Nous ne la reconnaissons pas. Et pourtant il y a là un être que nous sentons bien que nous avons déjà vu. Mais cet être-là ce n’est pas Odette ; le visage de cet être, son corps, son aspect, nous sont bien connus. Ils nous rappellent, non pas la femme, qui ne se tenait jamais ainsi, dont la pose habituelle ne dessine nullement une telle étrange et provocante arabesque, mais d’autres femmes, toutes celles qu’a peintes Elstir et que toujours, si différentes qu’elles puissent être, il a aimé à camper ainsi de face, le pied cambré dépassant de la jupe, le large chapeau rond tenu à la main, répondant symétriquement, à la hauteur du genou qu’il couvre, à cet autre disque vu de face, le visage. Et enfin non seulement un portrait génial disloque le type d’une femme, tel que l’ont défini sa coquetterie et sa conception égoïste de la beauté, mais s’il est ancien, il ne se contente pas de vieillir l’original de la même manière que la photographie, en le montrant dans des atours démodés. Dans le portrait, ce n’est pas seulement la manière que la femme avait de s’habiller qui date, c’est aussi la manière que l’artiste avait de peindre. Cette manière, la première manière d’Elstir, était l’extrait de naissance le plus accablant pour Odette, parce qu’il faisait d’elle non pas seulement comme ses photographies d’alors une cadette de cocottes connues, mais parce qu’il faisait de son portrait le contemporain d’un des nombreux portraits que Manet ou Whistler ont peints d’après tant de modèles disparus qui appartiennent déjà à l’oubli ou à l’histoire.","But moreover, had the portrait not been prior, like Swann's favorite photograph, to the systematization of Odette's features into a new type, majestic and charming, but later, that it would have sufficed to see of Elstir to disrupt this guy. The artistic genius acts like these extremely high temperatures which have the power to dissociate the combinations of atoms and to group them according to an absolutely opposite order, corresponding to another type. All this artificial harmony that the woman has imposed on her features and whose persistence every day before going out she monitors in her mirror, loading the tilt of the hat, the smoothing of the hair, the playfulness of the gaze, in order to ensure continuity, this harmony, the glance of the great painter destroys it in a second, and in its place he makes a grouping of the features of the woman, so as to give satisfaction to a certain feminine and pictorial ideal that he carries in him. In the same way, it often happens that from a certain age, the eye of a great researcher finds everywhere the elements necessary to establish the relations which alone interest him. Like those laborers and gamblers who make no fuss and are satisfied with what comes to hand, they could say anything: this will do. Thus a cousin of the Princess of Luxembourg, a most haughty beauty, having once fallen in love with an art which was new at that time, had asked the greatest of naturalist painters to paint her portrait. Immediately the eye of the artist had found what he was looking for everywhere. And on the canvas there was a scooter in place of the great lady, and behind it a vast, sloping, purple decor that made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going that far, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist in no way seek to satisfy some of the requirements of woman - such as those which, for example, when she begins to age, the have themselves photographed in almost girlish outfits that emphasize her youthful figure and make her look like the sister or even the daughter of her daughter, the latter if necessary ""fagoted"" for the occasion, next to her – and on the contrary will highlight the disadvantages that she tries to hide and which, like a feverish, even greenish complexion, tempt him all the more because they have “character”; but they suffice to disenchant the vulgar spectator and reduce for him to crumbs the ideal whose armature woman so proudly upheld and which placed her in her unique, irreducible form, so outside, so above the rest of the humanity. Now fallen, situated outside her own type where she sat enthroned invulnerable, she is nothing more than an ordinary woman in whose superiority we have lost all faith. We made this guy so much consist in him, not only the beauty of an Odette, but her personality, her identity, that in front of the portrait which stripped her of him, we are tempted to exclaim not only: ""As it's ugly”, but: “How unlike it is. We find it hard to believe that it is her. We don't recognize it. And yet there is a being there that we feel we have already seen. But that being is not Odette; the face of this being, its body, its aspect, are well known to us. They remind us, not of the woman, who never stood like this, whose habitual pose in no way draws such a strange and provocative arabesque, but of other women, all those whom Elstir painted and who always, so different as they may be, he liked to stand facing like this, the arched foot protruding from the skirt, the large round hat held in the hand, responding symmetrically, at the height of the knee which it covers, to this other disc seen from face, the face. And finally, not only does a brilliant portrait dislocate the type of a woman, as defined by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is old, it does not content itself with aging the original of the same way as the photograph, showing him in old-fashioned attire. In the portrait, it is not only the way the woman had to dress that dates, it is also the way the artist had to paint. This manner, Elstir's first manner, was the most damning birth certificate for Odette, because it made her not only, like her photographs of the time, a youngest of well-known cocottes, but because it made his portrait the contemporary of one of the many portraits that Manet or Whistler painted after so many vanished models that already belong to oblivion or to history.","But apart from this, had the portrait been not anterior like Swann's favourite photograph, to the systematisation of Odette's features in a fresh type, majestic and charming, but subsequent to it, Elstir's vision would alone have sufficed to disorganise that type. Artistic genius in its reactions is like those extremely high temperatures which have the power to disintegrate combinations of atoms which they proceed to combine afresh in a diametrically opposite order, following another type. All that artificially harmonious whole into which a woman has succeeded in bringing her limbs and features, the persistence of which every day, before going out, she studies in her glass, changing the angle of her hat, smoothing her hair, exercising the sprightliness in her eyes, so as to ensure its continuity, that harmony the keen eye of the great painter instantly destroys, substituting for it a rearrangement of the woman's features such as will satisfy a certain pictorial ideal of femininity which he carries in his head. Similarly it often happens that, after a certain age, the eye of a great seeker after truth will find everywhere the elements necessary to establish those relations which alone are of interest to him. Like those craftsmen, those players who, instead of making a fuss and asking for what they cannot have, content themselves with the instrument that comes to their hand, the artist might say of anything, no matter what, that it would serve his purpose. Thus a cousin of the Princesse de Luxembourg, a beauty of the most queenly type, having succumbed to a form of art which was new at that time, had asked the leading painter of the naturalist school to do her portrait. At once the artist's eye had found what he sought everywhere in life. And on his canvas there appeared, in place of the proud lady, a street–boy, and behind him a vast, sloping, purple background which made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going so far as that, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not seek in the least to give satisfaction to various demands on the woman's part—such as for instance, when she begins to age, make her have herself photographed in dresses that are almost those of a young girl, which bring out her still youthful figure and make her appear like the sister, or even the daughter of her own daughter, who, if need be, is tricked out for the occasion as a 'perfect fright' by her side—it will, on the contrary, emphasise those very drawbacks which she seeks to hide, and which (as for instance a feverish, that is to say a livid complexion) are all the more tempting to him since they give his picture 'character'; they are quite enough, however, to destroy all the illusions of the ordinary man who, when he sees the picture, sees crumble into dust the ideal which the woman herself has so proudly sustained for him, which has placed her in her unique, her unalterable form so far apart, so far above the rest of humanity. Fallen now, represented otherwise than in her own type in which she sat unassailably enthroned, she is become nothing more than just an ordinary woman, in the legend of whose superiority we have lost all faith. In this type we are so accustomed to regard as included not only the beauty of an Odette but her personality, her identity, that standing before the portrait which has thus transposed her from it we are inclined to protest not simply ""How plain he has made her!"" but ""Why, it isn't the least bit like her! "" We find it hard to believe that it can be she. We do not recognise her. And yet there is a person there on the canvas whom we are quite conscious of having seen before. But that person is not Odette; the face of the person, her body, her general appearance seem familiar. They recall to us not this particular woman who never held herself like that, whose natural pose had no suggestion of any such strange and teasing arabesque in its outlines, but other women, all the women whom Elstir has ever painted, women whom invariably, however they may differ from one another, he has chosen to plant thus on his canvas facing you, with an arched foot thrust out from under the skirt, a large round hat in one hand, symmetrically corresponding at the level of the knee which it hides to what also appears as a disc, higher up in the picture: the face. And furthermore, not only does a portrait by the hand of genius disintegrate and destroy a woman's type, as it has been denned by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is also old, it is not content with ageing the original in the same way as a photograph ages its sitter, by shewing her dressed in the fashions of long ago. In a portrait, it is not only the manner the woman then had of dressing that dates it, there is also the manner the artist had of painting. And this, Elstir's earliest manner, was the most damaging of birth certificates for Odette because it not only established her, as did her photographs of the same period, as the younger sister of various time–honoured courtesans, but made her portrait contemporary with the countless portraits that Manet or Whistler had painted of all those vanished models, models who already belonged to oblivion or to history.","But even if the portrait had belonged, not to a time (like Swann’s favourite photograph) before the definitive redesign of Odette’s features into their new pattern, full of majesty and charm, but to a later period, Elstir’s vision would have sufficed to disorganize that pattern too. An artist’s genius functions like the extremely high temperatures which can dissociate combinations of atoms and reshape them into a totally opposite order, one which corresponds to a different pattern. The whole factitious harmony which a woman imposes on her features, checking the continuity of it in her mirror each day before she goes out, making sure that it inheres in the angle of the hat, the smoothness of the hair, the vivacity of her expression, can be dismantled in a second by the eye of a great painter, who puts in its stead a rearrangement of her features more in accordance with a certain feminine and pictorial ideal of his own. Similarly, it often happens that after a certain age, the eye of the great researcher, wherever it looks, notices elements essential to the establishing of the only relationships which interest him. Such men, like versatile workers or card-players who do not mind turning their hand to any job or game, could say of any material: This will do. In this connection, a cousin of the Princess of Luxembourg, a woman of great beauty and arrogance, having taken a fancy to a form of art which was new at the time, commissioned a portrait of herself from the most prominent of the painters of the Naturalist school. The artist’s eye had instantly detected what it sought everywhere: on the completed canvas, instead of the grand lady, there was a dressmaker’s errand-girl, against a broad inclined background of violet which called to mind the place Pigalle. But even without going to those lengths, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not try to satisfy any of its subject’s requirements – such as those which make a woman who is beginning to age want to be photographed wearing things more suited to young girls, which flatter her with a youthful figure and make her look like the sister, or even the daughter, of her daughter, whom she may even have stand beside her in a suitably dowdy dress for the occasion – but it will underscore unfavourable features of her which she tries to conceal (such as a feverish, vaguely greenish flush to the face) and which the artist will find interesting because they have ‘character’, but which will eventually disgust the vulgar viewer, as they reduce to nothing the feminine ideal of which her person was once the impressive embodiment and which had seemed to place her, in her unique, irreducible form, beyond and far above the rest of humanity. Deposed, expelled from her own pattern, over which she had once reigned supreme, she has become a mere woman like any other, a sometime paragon in whom all faith has been lost. In our minds, the pattern constituted by an Odette de Crécy used to consist not just in her beauty, but also in her personality, her identity, so much so that, faced with the portrait which strips her of that pattern, we are tempted to exclaim not only, ‘How ugly he’s made her!’ but, ‘He can’t even paint a likeness!’ We have difficulty in believing it is the same woman; we cannot recognize her. Despite which, we sense perfectly well the presence of someone we have already seen, but it is someone who is not Odette. Yet the face, the body, the appearance are very familiar to us. They remind us, not of this woman, who has never stood like that, whose habitual posture never traces such a strange and provocative outline, but of other women, all those whom Elstir has painted and whom, however different they may be from one another, he has always liked to pose in full face like that, one arched foot showing under the skirt, the large round hat hanging from one hand, a symmetrical reminder, at the level of the knee which it conceals, of the other full round disk of the face. A brilliant portrait not only disassembles the pattern of the woman, as her pride in her appearance and her self-centred conception of beauty had defined it, but if it is an old portrait it also ages the original in the same way as photographs do, by showing her in her old-fashioned finery. In a portrait, however, it is not just a woman’s style of dress that dates, it is also the painter’s style of painting. And Elstir’s earliest style, from his first period, gave Odette her most merciless birth certificate, not just because, like photographs of her from that time, it made her a junior among well-known courtesans, but because it showed that the painting dated from the period of the many portraits by Manet or Whistler of sitters long vanished, consigned to history, gone to oblivion."
"La dose de bière, à plus forte raison de champagne, qu’à Balbec je n’aurais pas voulu atteindre en une semaine, alors pourtant qu’à ma conscience calme et lucide la saveur de ces breuvages représentassent un plaisir clairement appréciable mais aisément sacrifié, je l’absorbais en une heure en y ajoutant quelques gouttes de porto, trop distrait pour pouvoir le goûter, et je donnais au violoniste qui venait de jouer les deux « louis » que j’avais économisés depuis un mois en vue d’un achat que je ne me rappelais pas. Quelques-uns des garçons qui servaient, lâchés entre les tables, fuyaient à toute vitesse, ayant sur leur paumes tendues un plat que cela semblait être le but de ce genre de courses de ne pas laisser choir. Et de fait, les soufflés au chocolat arrivaient à destination sans avoir été renversés, les pommes à l’anglaise, malgré le galop qui avait dû les secouer, rangées comme au départ autour de l’agneau de Pauilhac. Je remarquai un de ces servants, très grand, emplumé de superbes cheveux noirs, la figure fardée d’un teint qui rappelait davantage certaines espèces d’oiseaux rares que l’espèce humaine et qui, courant sans trêve et, eût-on dit, sans but, d’un bout à l’autre de la salle, faisait penser à quelqu’un de ces « aras » qui remplissent les grandes volières des jardins zoologiques de leur ardent coloris et de leur incompréhensible agitation. Bientôt le spectacle s’ordonna, à mes yeux du moins, d’une façon plus noble et plus calme. Toute cette activité vertigineuse se fixait en une calme harmonie. Je regardais les tables rondes, dont l’assemblée innombrable emplissait le restaurant, comme autant de planètes, telles que celles-ci sont figurées dans les tableaux allégoriques d’autrefois. D’ailleurs, une force d’attraction irrésistible s’exerçait entre ces astres divers et à chaque table les dîneurs n’avaient d’yeux que pour les tables où ils n’étaient pas, exception faite pour quelque riche amphitryon, lequel ayant réussi à amener un écrivain célèbre, s’évertuait à tirer de lui, grâce aux vertus de la table tournante, des propos insignifiants dont les dames s’émerveillaient. L’harmonie de ces tables astrales n’empêchait pas l’incessante révolution des servants innombrables, lesquels parce qu’au lieu d’être assis, comme les dîneurs, ils étaient debout, évoluaient dans une zone supérieure. Sans doute l’un courait porter des hors-d’œuvres, changer le vin, ajouter des verres. Mais malgré ces raisons particulières, leur course perpétuelle entre les tables rondes finissait par dégager la loi de sa circulation vertigineuse et réglée. Assises derrière un massif de fleurs, deux horribles caissières, occupées à des calculs sans fin, semblaient deux magiciennes occupées à prévoir par des calculs astrologiques les bouleversements qui pouvaient parfois se produire dans cette voûte céleste conçue selon la science du moyen âge.","The dose of beer, let alone champagne, which at Balbec I would not have liked to reach in a week, even though to my calm and lucid conscience the flavor of these beverages represented a pleasure that was clearly appreciable but easily sacrificed , I absorbed it in an hour by adding a few drops of port, too distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just played the two ""louis"" that I had saved for a month for a purchase that I did not remember. A few of the waiters who were serving, dropped between the tables, fled at full speed, having on their outstretched palms a dish that it seemed to be the aim of this kind of races not to drop. And in fact, the chocolate soufflés arrived at their destination without having been spilled, the boiled apples, despite the gallop which must have shaken them, lined up as at the start around the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, feathered with superb black hair, his face made up with a complexion more reminiscent of certain species of rare birds than of the human species, and who, running ceaselessly and, one would have said, aimlessly, from one end of the room to the other, made one think of one of those ""macaws"" which fill the great aviaries of the zoological gardens with their ardent color and their incomprehensible agitation. Soon the spectacle was organized, in my eyes at least, in a more noble and calmer way. All this vertiginous activity settled in a calm harmony. I looked at the round tables, whose innumerable assembly filled the restaurant, like so many planets, such as these are figured in the allegorical paintings of the past. Moreover, an irresistible force of attraction was exerted between these various stars and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables where they were not, except for some rich host, who having succeeded to bring a famous writer, strove to extract from him, thanks to the virtues of the turntable, insignificant remarks at which the ladies marveled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the innumerable servants, who, because instead of being seated, like the diners, they were standing, evolved in a higher zone. No doubt one was running to bring appetizers, change the wine, add glasses. But despite these particular reasons, their perpetual race between the round tables ended by freeing the law from its vertiginous and regulated circulation. Seated behind a clump of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two magicians busy predicting by astrological calculations the upheavals which could sometimes occur in this celestial vault conceived according to the science of the Middle Ages.","The dose of beer—all the more, that of champagne—which at Balbec I should not have ventured to take in a week, albeit to my calm and lucid consciousness the flavour of those beverages represented a pleasure clearly appreciable, since it was also one that could easily be sacrificed, I now imbibed at a sitting, adding to it a few drops of port wine, too much distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just been playing the two louis which I had been saving up for the last month with a view to buying something, I could not remember what. Several of the waiters, set going among the tables, were flying along at full speed, each carrying on his outstretched palms a dish which it seemed to be the object of this kind of race not to let fall. And in fact the chocolate soufflés arrived at their destination unspilled, the potatoes à l'anglaise, in spite of the pace which ought to have sent them flying, came arranged as at the start round the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, plumed with superb black locks, his face dyed in a tint that suggested rather certain species of rare birds than a human being, who, running without pause (and, one would have said, without purpose) from one end of the room to the other, made me think of one of those macaws which fill the big aviaries in zoological gardens with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Presently the spectacle assumed an order, in my eyes at least, growing at once more noble and more calm. All this dizzy activity became fixed in a quiet harmony. I looked at the round tables whose innumerable assemblage filled the restaurant like so many planets as planets are represented in old allegorical pictures. Moreover, there seemed to be some irresistibly attractive force at work among these divers stars, and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables at which they were not sitting, except perhaps some wealthy amphitryon who, having managed to secure a famous author, was endeavouring to extract from him, thanks to the magic properties of the turning table, a few unimportant remarks at which the ladies marvelled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the countless servants who, because instead of being seated like the diners they were on their feet, performed their evolutions in a more exalted sphere. No doubt they were running, one to fetch the hors d'œuvre, another to change the wine or with clean glasses. But despite these special reasons, their perpetual course among the round tables yielded, after a time, to the observer the law of its dizzy but ordered circulation. Seated behind a bank of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two witches occupied in forecasting by astrological signs the disasters that might from time to time occur in this celestial vault fashioned according to the scientific conceptions of the middle ages.","An amount of beer, let alone of champagne, which I would not have wanted to drink in a week at Balbec, even though my mind, when unclouded and sober, was capable of having a clear appreciation of the taste of these drinks as a pleasure, albeit one which could be easily forgone, now passed my lips in the space of an hour, interspersed with a little port, which I was too preoccupied even to taste; and to the violinist, who had just played for us, I gave the two golden louis, saved over the previous month so as to enable me to buy something which had now completely gone from my head. Some of the waiters rushed along the aisles between the rows of tables, one outstretched hand bearing a dish which it was the seeming purpose of this type of race not to drop. Sure enough, the chocolate soufflés reached their destination without spilling, the potatoes à l’anglaise, despite the canter and the apparent shaking about, always arrived as they had set out, neatly ranged about the Pauillac lamb.85 I noticed one of these servers, very tall, with a superb plume of black hair and wearing make-up of a colour more suggestive of certain species of rare birds than of a human face, who ran to and fro, without let-up and, it seemed, without purpose, from one end of the room to the other, and brought to mind the macaws which fill the large aviaries in zoos with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Soon the spectacle became more ordered, at least to my eyes, turning into something nobler and calmer. All the giddy activity slowed down and settled into a soothing harmony. I could see the round tables, a countless constellation of them filling the restaurant like so many planets, as depicted in allegorical paintings from earlier times. These different heavenly bodies also exercised irresistible attractions on one another, and at every table the diners kept looking at the other tables, except for a rich man entertaining guests, including a famous writer whom he had managed to attract, whom he was now plying with questions, in the hope that the virtues of the turning table would induce him to utter inanities, which the ladies would marvel at. The harmony of these astral tables did not impede the incessant revolutions of the innumerable servers who, being on foot, unlike the seated diners, moved in a higher realm. Of course, one or other of them dashed in with the hors-d’œuvre, changed the wine, brought extra glasses. But despite these particular reasons, their perpetual hurrying about among the round tables eventually clarified the law of its own restlessness, dizzying but regulated. Like a pair of witches, sitting behind a great floral decoration, two ghastly cashiers, endlessly busy with their arithmetic, seemed engaged in astrological calculations of the upheavals which might on occasion disrupt life in this planetary system, designed in accordance with the science of the Middle Ages."
"Mais pour une grande part, notre étonnement vient surtout de ce que l’être nous présente aussi une même face. Il nous faudrait un si grand effort pour recréer tout ce qui nous a été fourni par ce qui n’est pas nous – fût-ce le goût d’un fruit – qu’à peine l’impression reçue, nous descendons insensiblement la pente du souvenir et sans nous en rendre compte, en très peu de temps, nous sommes très loin de ce que nous avons senti. De sorte que chaque entrevue est une espèce de redressement qui nous ramène à ce que nous avions bien vu. Nous ne nous en souvenions déjà tant ce qu’on appelle se rappeler un être c’est en réalité l’oublier. Mais aussi longtemps que nous savons encore voir, au moment où le trait oublié nous apparaît, nous le reconnaissons, nous sommes obligés de rectifier la ligne déviée, et ainsi la perpétuelle et féconde surprise qui rendait si salutaires et assouplissants pour moi ces rendez-vous quotidiens avec les belles jeunes filles du bord de la mer était faite, tout autant que de découvertes, de réminiscence. En ajoutant à cela l’agitation éveillée par ce qu’elles étaient pour moi, qui n’était jamais tout à fait ce que j’avais cru et qui faisait que l’espérance de la prochaine réunion n’était plus semblable à la précédente espérance, mais au souvenir encore vibrant du dernier entretien, on comprendra que chaque promenade donnait un violent coup de barre à mes pensées, et non pas du tout dans le sens que, dans la solitude de ma chambre, j’avais pu tracer à tête reposée. Cette direction-là était oubliée, abolie, quand je rentrais vibrant comme une ruche des propos qui m’avaient troublé, et qui retentissaient longtemps en moi. Chaque être est détruit quand nous cessons de le voir ; puis son apparition suivante est une création nouvelle, différente de celle qui l’a immédiatement précédée, sinon de toutes. Car le minimum de variété qui puisse régner dans ces créations est de deux. Nous souvenant d’un coup d’œil énergique, d’un air hardi, c’est inévitablement la fois suivante par un profil quasi languide, par une sorte de douceur rêveuse, choses négligées par nous dans le précédent souvenir, que nous serons, à la prochaine rencontre, étonnés, c’est-à-dire presque uniquement frappés. Dans la confrontation de notre souvenir à la nouvelle réalité, c’est cela qui marquera notre déception ou notre surprise, nous apparaîtra comme la retouche de la réalité en nous avertissant que nous nous étions mal rappelés. À son tour l’aspect, la dernière fois négligé, du visage, et à cause de cela même le plus saisissant cette fois-ci, le plus réel, le plus rectificatif, deviendra matière à rêverie, à souvenirs. C’est un profil langoureux et rond, une expression douce, rêveuse que nous désirerons revoir. Et alors de nouveau la fois suivante, ce qu’il y a de volontaire dans les yeux perçants, dans le nez pointu, dans les lèvres serrées, viendra corriger l’écart entre notre désir et l’objet auquel il a cru correspondre. Bien entendu, cette fidélité aux impressions premières, et purement physiques, retrouvées à chaque fois auprès de mes amies, ne concernait pas que les traits de leur visage puisqu’on a vu que j’étais aussi sensible à leur voix, plus troublante peut-être (car elle n’offre pas seulement les mêmes surfaces singulières et sensuelles que lui, elle fait partie de l’abîme inaccessible qui donne le vertige des baisers sans espoir), leur voix pareille au son unique d’un petit instrument, où chacune se mettait tout entière et qui n’était qu’à elle. Tracée par une inflexion, telle ligne profonde d’une de ces voix m’étonnait quand je la reconnaissais après l’avoir oubliée. Si bien que les rectifications qu’à chaque rencontre nouvelle j’étais obligé de faire, pour le retour à la parfaite justesse, étaient aussi bien d’un accordeur ou d’un maître de chant que d’un dessinateur.","But to a large extent, our astonishment comes above all from the fact that being also presents us with the same face. It would take such a great effort to recreate all that has been provided to us by what is not us – even the taste of a fruit – that as soon as we have received the impression, we imperceptibly descend the slope of the memory and without realizing it, in a very short time, we are very far from what we felt. So that each interview is a kind of rectification which brings us back to what we had seen. We already did not remember it so much that what is called remembering a being is actually forgetting it. But as long as we still know how to see, at the moment when the forgotten feature appears to us, we recognize it, we are obliged to rectify the deviated line, and thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made these encounters so salutary and softening for me. daily life with beautiful young girls by the sea was made up of discoveries and reminiscences. Adding to this the restlessness aroused by what they were for me, which was never quite what I had believed and which made the hope for the next meeting no longer similar to the previous one. hope, but from the still vibrant memory of the last interview, you will understand that each walk gave a violent shock to my thoughts, and not at all in the sense that, in the solitude of my room, I had been able to rested. That direction was forgotten, abolished, when I came home vibrating like a beehive with the words that had troubled me, and that resounded within me for a long time. Every being is destroyed when we stop seeing it; then its next appearance is a new creation, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from all of them. Because the minimum variety that can reign in these creations is two. Remembering with an energetic glance, with a bold air, it is inevitably the next time by an almost languid profile, by a kind of dreamy sweetness, things neglected by us in the preceding memory, that we will be, at the next meeting, astonished, that is to say almost uniquely impressed. In the confrontation of our memory with the new reality, this is what will mark our disappointment or our surprise, will appear to us as the retouching of reality by warning us that we had badly remembered. In turn, the aspect of the face, the last time neglected, and because of this even the most striking this time, the most real, the most corrective, will become matter for daydreaming, for memories. It is a languorous and round profile, a soft, dreamy expression that we would like to see again. And then again the next time, what is voluntary in the piercing eyes, in the pointed nose, in the tight lips, will come to correct the gap between our desire and the object to which it believed to correspond. Of course, this fidelity to the first impressions, and purely physical ones, found each time with my friends, did not only concern the features of their faces since we have seen that I was also sensitive to their voice, more disturbing perhaps. being (because she not only offers the same singular and sensual surfaces as him, she is part of the inaccessible abyss which gives the vertigo of hopeless kisses), their voice like the unique sound of a small instrument, where each put herself entirely and which belonged only to her. Traced by an inflection, such a deep line of one of these voices surprised me when I recognized it after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections that at each new meeting I was obliged to make, for the return to perfect accuracy, were as much from a tuner or a singing master as from a draftsman.","But to a great extent our astonishment springs from the other person's presenting to us also a face that is the same as before. It would require so immense an effort to reconstruct everything that has been imparted to us by things other than ourselves—were it only the taste of a fruit—that no sooner is the impression received than we begin imperceptibly to descend the slope of memory and, without noticing anything, in a very short time, we have come a long way from what we actually felt. So that every fresh encounter is a sort of rectification, which brings us back to what we really did see. We have no longer any recollection of this, to such an extent does what we call remembering a person consist really in forgetting him. But so long as we can still see at the moment when the forgotten aspect appears, we recognise it, we are obliged to correct the straying line; thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made so salutary and invigorating for me these daily outings with the charming damsels of the sea shore, consisted fully as much in recognition as in discovery. When there is added to this the agitation aroused by what these girls were to me, which was never quite what I had supposed, and meant that my expectancy of our next meeting resembled not so much my expectancy the time before as the still throbbing memory of our latest conversation, it will be realised that each of our excursions made a violent interruption in the course of my thoughts and moved them clean out of the direction which, in the solitude of my own room, I had been able to trace for them at my leisure. That plotted course was forgotten, had ceased to exist, when I returned home buzzing like a hive of bees with remarks which had disquieted me when I heard them and were still echoing in my brain. The other person is destroyed when we cease to see him; after which his next appearance means a fresh creation of him, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from them all. For the minimum variation that is to be found in these creations is duality. If we have in mind a strong and searching glance, a bold manner, it is inevitably, next time, by a half–languid profile, a sort of dreamy gentleness, overlooked by us in our previous impression, that we shall be, on meeting him again, astonished, that is to say almost solely struck. In confronting our memory with the new reality it is this that will mark the extent of our disappointment or surprise, will appear to us like the revised version of an earlier reality warning us that we had not remembered it correctly. In its turn, the facial aspect neglected the time before, and for that very reason the most striking this time, the most real, the most documentary, will become a matter for dreams and memories. It is a languorous and rounded profile, a gentle, dreamy expression which we shall now desire to see again. And then, next time, such resolution, such strength of character as there may be in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose, the tight lips, will come to correct the discrepancy between our desire and the object to which it has supposed itself to correspond. It is understood, of course, that this loyalty to the first and purely physical impressions which I formed afresh at each encounter with my friends did not involve only their facial appearance, since the reader has seen that I was sensible also of their voices, more disquieting still, perhaps (for not only does a voice offer the same strange and sensuous surfaces as a face, it issues from that unknown, inaccessible region the mere thought of which sets the mind swimming with unattainable kisses), their voices each like the unique sound of a little instrument into which the player put all her artistry and which was found only in her possession. Traced by a casual inflexion, a sudden deep chord in one of their voices would astonish me when I recognised after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections which after every fresh meeting I was obliged to make so as to ensure absolute accuracy were as much those of a tuner or singing–master as a draughtsman's.","But then again, much of our surprise comes also from the very fact that the person does show the same aspect. It would take such a huge effort to recreate whatever we have derived from outside ourselves, even just the taste of a certain fruit, say, that as soon as we receive the slightest impression, we slide gradually down memory’s gentle slope; and before long, without realizing it, we have gone a long way from what we really felt. Each new encounter is a readjustment, bringing us back to what we in fact saw. Faithful recollection of it was already lost, for what is called remembering somebody is actually a process of forgetting. For as long as we are still capable of seeing, however, no sooner does the forgotten feature impinge on our sight than we recognize it, and are obliged to straighten the line which had deviated; and so the rich and ever-ready surprise which made my daily encounters with these lovely young girls by the sea so beneficial and refreshing was a thing not only of discovery but of retrieval. Add to that the commotion inspired in me by what they meant to me (for that was never quite what I thought it would be; and what I looked forward to each time was not what I had looked forward to the time before, that having been supplanted by the thrill of the memory of our last meeting) and it will be clear that each of our outings suddenly turned my thoughts in a wholly unexpected direction; and this direction was never the one which, in the seclusion of my room at the hotel, I had foreseen and calmly reconnoitred. It was now forgotten, abolished, each time I came back to my room, my head buzzing like a hive with words which had stirred me and which went on reverberating for a long time in my mind. A person lost sight of is a person destroyed; a person who reappears is a new creation, different from the one before and possibly from all previous incarnations. The minimum of variety that can exist in such creations is two. When what stays in our mind is the vivid flash of a bold glance, inevitably what will take us by surprise in our next glimpse, almost solely strike us, that is, will be a look close to languid, a gentle and pensive expression, overlooked in the former memory. It is this which, in our comparison of memory with the new reality, will colour our disappointment or our surprise; and by its notifying us that our memory had been defective, it will seem to be reality itself which was in need of refocussing. Then the aspect of the face that was recently overlooked, having now become for that reason the most unforgettable, the most real, the most accurately corrective, will itself become an object for us to dream about and recall. What we long for now is a soft, languorous look, an expression full of gentle pensiveness. Then the same thing will happen the next time: it will be the strange determination in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose and the tense lips which will cancel the disparity between our desire and the object it thought it had in mind. Of course, this fidelity to first impressions, the purely physical ones, which I re-encountered each time I saw the girls, was an effect not just of their facial features, since as has been seen I was also responsive to their voices (more responsive perhaps, for the voice not only offers the same singular and sensual surfaces as the facial features, it belongs to those unplumbable depths tempting us to the vertiginous peril of impossible kisses), in each of which sounded the unique note of a little instrument utterly expressive of its owner and playable by no one but her. A dark line in any of their voices, drawn by one of their intonations, surprised me each time I recognized it again, after having forgotten it. And the corrections I had to make, on each new occasion, so as to retrieve perfect accuracy, were as much those required of a tuner or a singing-master as of a draughtsman."
"Il fallait rejoindre Elstir. Je m’aperçus dans une glace. En plus du désastre de ne pas avoir été présenté, je remarquai que ma cravate était tout de travers, mon chapeau laissait voir mes cheveux longs ce qui m’allait mal ; mais c’était une chance tout de même qu’elles m’eussent, même ainsi, rencontré avec Elstir et ne pussent pas m’oublier ; c’en était une autre que j’eusse ce jour-là, sur le conseil de ma grand’mère, mis mon joli gilet qu’il s’en était fallu de si peu que j’eusse remplacé par un affreux, et pris ma plus belle canne ; car un événement que nous désirons ne se produisant jamais comme nous avons pensé, à défaut des avantages sur lesquels nous croyions pouvoir compter, d’autres que nous n’espérions pas se sont présentés, le tout se compense ; et nous redoutions tellement le pire que nous sommes finalement enclins à trouver que dans l’ensemble pris en bloc, le hasard nous a, somme toute, plutôt favorisé.","We had to join Elstir. I saw myself in a mirror. In addition to the disaster of not being introduced, I noticed that my tie was all askew, my hat showed my long hair which was bad for me; but it was a good thing all the same that they had, even so, met me with Elstir and could not forget me; it was another thing that I had that day, on the advice of my grandmother, put on my pretty waistcoat which I had come so close to replacing by an ugly one, and took my finest cane; because an event that we desire never occurs as we thought, in the absence of the advantages on which we believed we could count, others that we did not hope have presented themselves, the whole is compensated; and we feared the worst so much that we are finally inclined to find that, taken as a whole, chance has, on the whole, rather favored us.","But I must not keep Elstir waiting. I caught sight of myself in a glass. To add to the disaster of my not having been introduced to the girls, I noticed that my necktie was all crooked, my hat left long wisps of hair shewing, which did not become me; but it was a piece of luck, all the same, that they should have seen me, even thus attired, in Elstir's company and so could not forget me; also that I should have put on, that morning, at my grandmother's suggestion, my smart waistcoat, when I might so easily have been wearing one that was simply hideous, and be carrying my best stick. For while an event for which we are longing never happens quite in the way we have been expecting, failing the advantages on which we supposed that we might count, others present themselves for which we never hoped, and make up for our disappointment; and we have been so dreading the worst that in the end we are inclined to feel that, taking one thing with another, chance has, on the whole, been rather kind to us.","I had to rejoin Elstir. A mirror showed me my reflection: in addition to the disaster of not having been introduced, I noticed that my tie was crooked and that my hair, which was too long, was sticking out from under my hat. Still, it was a good thing that they had at least seen me with Elstir, even in such a state, and would not be able to forget me; and it was lucky that I had heeded my grandmother’s suggestion that I put on my handsome waistcoat, when I had all but decided to wear an awful one instead, and that I carry my best cane: no event which we look forward to ever turns out quite as we wish it to, but in the absence of the advantages we had hoped to be able to count on, others arise unexpectedly, and there are compensations; we so dreaded the worst that we are ultimately inclined, taking one thing with another, to think that chance was, on balance, on our side."
"Au fur et à mesure que la saison s’avança changea le tableau que j’y trouvais dans la fenêtre. D’abord il faisait grand jour, et sombre seulement s’il faisait mauvais temps ; alors, dans le verre glauque et qu’elle boursouflait de ses vagues rondes, la mer, sertie entre les montants de fer de ma croisée comme dans les plombs d’un vitrail, effilochait sur toute la profonde bordure rocheuse de la baie des triangles empennés d’une immobile écume linéamentée avec la délicatesse d’une plume ou d’un duvet dessinés par Pisanello, et fixés par cet émail blanc, inaltérable et crémeux qui figure une couche de neige dans les verreries de Gallé.","As the season progressed, the picture I found in the window changed. First it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad; then, in the glaucous glass and which it swelled with its round waves, the sea, set between the iron uprights of my casement as in the leads of a stained glass window, frayed feathered triangles all over the deep rocky edge of the bay of a motionless foam lineamented with the delicacy of a feather or a down drawn by Pisanello, and fixed by this white, unalterable and creamy enamel which represents a layer of snow in the glassworks of Gallé.","Regularly, as the season advanced, the picture that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass which it distended with the curve of its round waves, the sea, set among the iron uprights of my window like a piece of stained glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of the bay little plumed triangles of an unmoving spray delineated with the delicacy of a feather or a downy breast from Pisanello's pencil, and fixed in that white, unalterable, creamy enamel which is used to depict fallen snow in Gallé's glass.","the painting on show in the window-frame kept changing as the season advanced. At the beginning of my stay, it was broad daylight, its tones sometimes dulled by bad weather: the sea, through the glaucous glass bulging with its round waves, held between the iron uprights of the frame as though set in the lead of a latticed window, teased out along the deep, rocky fringe of the bay triangles plumed with spray which hung motionless, touched in with the delicacy of down or a feather pencilled by Pisanello, and fixed by the creamy white never-fading enamel used for a fall of snow in glass-works by Gallé.82"
"Pour éviter les crises de suffocation que me donnerait le voyage, le médecin m’avait conseillé de prendre au moment du départ un peu trop de bière ou de cognac, afin d’être dans un état qu’il appelait « euphorie », où le système nerveux est momentanément moins vulnérable. J’étais encore incertain si je le ferais, mais je voulais au moins que ma grand’mère reconnût qu’au cas où je m’y déciderais, j’aurais pour moi le droit et la sagesse. Aussi j’en parlais comme si mon hésitation ne portait que sur l’endroit où je boirais de l’alcool, buffet ou wagon-bar. Mais aussitôt à l’air de blâme que prit le visage de ma grand’mère et de ne pas même vouloir s’arrêter à cette idée : « Comment, m’écriai-je, me résolvant soudain à cette action d’aller boire, dont l’exécution devenait nécessaire à prouver ma liberté puisque son annonce verbale n’avait pu passer sans protestation, comment, tu sais combien je suis malade, tu sais ce que le médecin m’a dit, et voilà le conseil que tu me donnes ! »","To avoid the attacks of suffocation that the trip would give me, the doctor had advised me to take a little too much beer or cognac when I left, in order to be in a state he called ""euphoria"", where the nervous system is momentarily less vulnerable. I was still uncertain if I would do it, but I wanted my grandmother to at least recognize that if I decided to do so, I would have the right and the wisdom on my side. So I talked about it as if my hesitation was only about where I would drink alcohol, buffet or bar car. But immediately at the look of blame that my grandmother's face took on, and of not even wanting to stop at this idea: ""How,"" I exclaimed, suddenly resolving to go and drink whose execution became necessary to prove my freedom since his verbal announcement could not pass without protest, how, you know how sick I am, you know what the doctor told me, and here is the advice you give me ! »","To prevent the choking fits which the journey might otherwise give me the doctor had advised me to take, as we started, a good stiff dose of beer or brandy, so as to begin the journey in a state of what he called 'euphoria,' in which the nervous system is for a time less vulnerable. I had not yet made up my mind whether I should do this, but I wished at least that my grandmother should admit that, if I did so decide, I should have wisdom and authority on my side. I spoke therefore as if my hesitation were concerned only with where I should go for my drink, to the bar on the platform or to the restaurant–car on the train. But immediately, at the air of reproach which my grandmother's face assumed, an air of not wishing even to entertain such an idea for a moment, ""What!"" I said to myself, suddenly determining upon this action of going out to drink, the performance of which became necessary as a proof of my independence since the verbal announcement of it had not succeeded in passing unchallenged, ""What! You know how ill I am, you know what the doctor ordered, and you treat me like this!""","To avoid the fits of breathlessness that the journey might bring on, the doctor had suggested that just before the train left I should drink a little too much beer or brandy, so as to be in the state he called ‘euphoria’, in which the nervous system is briefly less susceptible. I was still not sure whether I was going to comply; but I did want my grandmother to admit that, should I decide to do so, it would be in accordance with both authority and good sense. So when I mentioned it, I made it sound as though my only hesitation concerned the place where this alcohol would be drunk, the station buffet or the dining-carriage. But my grandmother’s face showed an expression of such disapproval, as though she was dismissing the idea out of hand, that I instantly resolved to have a drink, an act which had become necessary to demonstrate my freedom, since the merest hinting at it had been met with protest, and exclaimed, ‘What? You know how unwell I am! You know what the doctor’s orders are! And yet you’re trying to put me off!’"
"– Naturellement ! reprit-il. Cela prouve bien que c’est un esprit faux et malveillant. Mon pauvre fils, tu n’avais pas déjà beaucoup de sens commun, je suis désolé de te voir tombé dans un milieu qui va achever de te détraquer.","– Of course! he resumed. This proves that it is a false and malevolent spirit. My poor son, you didn't already have a lot of common sense, I'm sorry to see you fall into an environment that will completely unhinge you.","""I dare say!"" retorted my father. "" That simply proves that he's a foolish and evil–minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I'm sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.""","‘Well, of course! Which just goes to show what a nasty and bogus mind the man has! My dear boy, we already knew you weren’t gifted with a great deal of common sense. But it’s a shame to see you fall among people who can only make things much worse in that department.’"
"Mes parents cependant auraient souhaité que l’intelligence que Bergotte m’avait reconnue se manifestât par quelque travail remarquable. Quand je ne connaissais pas les Swann je croyais que j’étais empêché de travailler par l’état d’agitation où me mettait l’impossibilité de voir librement Gilberte. Mais quand leur demeure me fut ouverte, à peine je m’étais assis à mon bureau de travail que je me levais et courais chez eux. Et une fois que je les avais quittés et que j’étais rentré à la maison, mon isolement n’était qu’apparent, ma pensée ne pouvait plus remonter le courant du flux de paroles par lequel je m’étais laissé machinalement entraîner pendant des heures. Seul, je continuais à fabriquer les propos qui eussent été capables de plaire aux Swann, et pour donner plus d’intérêt au jeu, je tenais la place de ces partenaires absents, je me posais à moi-même des questions fictives choisies de telle façon que mes traits brillants ne leur servissent que d’heureuse répartie. Silencieux, cet exercice était pourtant une conversation et non une méditation, ma solitude une vie de salon mentale où c’était non ma propre personne mais des interlocuteurs imaginaires qui gouvernaient mes paroles et où j’éprouvais à former, au lieu des pensées que je croyais vraies, celles qui me venaient sans peine, sans régression du dehors vers le dedans, ce genre de plaisir tout passif que trouve à rester tranquille quelqu’un qui est alourdi par une mauvaise digestion.","My parents, however, would have liked the intelligence that Bergotte had recognized in me to manifest itself in some remarkable work. When I did not know the Swanns, I believed that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation in which the impossibility of seeing Gilberte freely put me. But when their home was opened to me, no sooner had I sat down at my desk than I got up and ran to their house. And once I had left them and returned home, my isolation was only apparent, my thoughts could no longer ascend the current of the flow of words by which I had allowed myself to be mechanically carried along for time. Alone, I continued to make the remarks that would have been able to please the Swanns, and to give more interest to the game, I took the place of these absent partners, I asked myself fictitious questions chosen in such a way that my brilliant features only serve them as a happy repartee. Silent, this exercise was nevertheless a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a life in a mental salon where it was not my own person but imaginary interlocutors who governed my words and where I had to form, instead of the thoughts that I I believed to be true, those which came to me without difficulty, without regression from the outside to the inside, that kind of entirely passive pleasure that someone who is weighed down by bad digestion finds in remaining quiet.","My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no introspection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion.","Meanwhile, my parents would have preferred it if the intelligence which had so impressed Bergotte could have been made manifest in some achievement. As long as I had been excluded from the Swanns’ acquaintance, I was convinced that my inability to get down to work was caused by the state of emotional disturbance to which I was reduced by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte as and when I wished to. But then, once I had free access to their house, I could hardly sit down at my desk before I had to jump up again and be off there to visit them. And when I had left the Swanns’ and gone back home, it was only in appearance that I sat alone; my own thoughts could not withstand the torrent of words on which for hours past I had let myself be carried along: I went on turning out words and sentences which might have impressed the Swanns; to make the game more enjoyable, I even played the parts of the absent others, asking myself fictitious questions so designed that, in answering them, I could show off the brilliance of my banter. Silent as it was, this exercise was a real conversation and not a form of reflection; my solitude was a mental drawing-room scene, in which imaginary interlocutors and not myself were in charge of my speech, in which by producing not ideas which I believed to be true, but ideas that came to me without trouble, without any action of the outer world on the inner, I enjoyed the same sort of pleasure as is enjoyed, in utter passivity, by the person who has nothing better to do after dinner but sit quietly, lulled into a dull somnolence by poor digestion."
"Les premiers rites d’exorcismes une fois accomplis, comme une fée hargneuse dépouille sa première apparence et se pare de grâces enchanteresses, je vis cet être dédaigneux devenir le plus aimable, le plus prévenant jeune homme que j’eusse jamais rencontré. « Bon, me dis-je, je me suis déjà trompé sur lui, j’avais été victime d’un mirage, mais je n’ai triomphé du premier que pour tomber dans un second car c’est un grand seigneur féru de noblesse et cherchant à le dissimuler. » Or, toute la charmante éducation, toute l’amabilité de Saint-Loup devait en effet, au bout de peu de temps, me laisser voir un autre être mais bien différent de celui que je soupçonnais.","The first rites of exorcisms once performed, like a surly fairy stripping off her first appearance and adorning herself with enchanting graces, I saw that disdainful being grow into the kindest, kindest young man I had ever met. “Well, I said to myself, I was already wrong about him, I had been the victim of a mirage, but I only triumphed over the first to fall into a second because he is a great lord keen on nobility. and trying to hide it. Now, all the charming education, all the friendliness of Saint-Loup was indeed, after a short time, to let me see another being, but very different from the one I suspected.","The first rites of exorcism once performed, as a wicked fairy discards her outer form and endures all the most enchanting graces , I saw this disdainful creature become the most friendly, the most considerate young man that I had ever met. ""Good,"" I said to myself, ""I've been mistaken about him once already; I was taken in by a mirage; but I have corrected the first only to fall into a second, for he must be a great gentleman who has grown sick of his nobility and is trying to hide it. "" As a matter of fact it was not long before all the exquisite breeding, all the friendliness of Saint–Loup were indeed to let me see another creature but one very different from what I had suspected.","These first rites of exorcism having been enacted, as a malevolent fairy divests itself of its first appearance and takes on the most captivating grace and beauty, I saw the man of disdain turn into the most likeable and considerate fellow I had ever met. ‘Well, I thought, I’ve already misread the man once, I’ve been fooled by a mirage; but now that I’ve seen through it, here I am being taken in by another one, because he’s clearly just one of the high and mighty, full of his own nobility, while pretending he’s not.’ In fact, before very long, all the charming manners and agreeableness of Saint-Loup were indeed to reveal another person in him, but a very different one from the person I now suspected him of being."
"– Comment, petite sotte, tu parles comme si tu avais deux ans. Qu’est-ce que tu dis : employé dans un ministère ? Il est tout simplement chef de cabinet, chef de toute la boutique, et encore, où ai-je la tête, ma parole, je suis aussi distrait que toi, il n’est pas chef de cabinet, il est directeur du cabinet.","– How, you little fool, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean: employed in a ministry? He is simply chief of staff, chief of the whole shop, and still, where am I, my word, I am as distracted as you, he is not chief of staff, he is director of cabinet.","You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; 'a clerk in some Ministry or other' indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what's more—what on earth am I thinking of?","– Silly girl! You sound like a two-year-old. Works in a big office, indeed! He’s actually the private secretary to the Minister – that means he’s the boss of the whole thing! Or wait, no"
"Et le lendemain, M. de Stermaria, qui savait que le bâtonnier avait plaidé pour un de ses amis, alla se présenter lui-même.","And the next day, M. de Stermaria, who knew that the President of the Bar had pleaded for one of his friends, went to introduce himself.","And next day M. de Stermaria, who remembered that the barrister had once held a brief for one of his friends, came up and introduced himself.","The following day, M. de Stermaria, who knew that the bâtonnier had on one occasion represented a friend of his in court, introduced himself."
"– En effet, le roi, qui a une rare mémoire des physionomies, a eu la bonté de se souvenir en m’apercevant à l’orchestre que j’avais eu l’honneur de le voir pendant plusieurs jours à la cour de Bavière, quand il ne songeait pas à son trône oriental (vous savez qu’il y a été appelé par un congrès européen, et il a même fort hésité à l’accepter, jugeant cette souveraineté un peu inégale à sa race, la plus noble, héraldiquement parlant, de toute l’Europe). Un aide de camp est venu me dire d’aller saluer Sa Majesté, à l’ordre de qui je me suis naturellement empressé de déférer.","– Indeed, the king, who has a rare memory of faces, was kind enough to remember when he saw me in the orchestra that I had had the honor of seeing him for several days at the court of Bavaria, when he was not thinking of his eastern throne (you know that he was called there by a European congress, and he even hesitated very much to accept it, judging this sovereignty a little unequal to his race, the most noble, heraldically speaking, from all over Europe). An aide-de-camp came to tell me to go and salute His Majesty, to whose order I naturally hastened to defer.","""Why, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne—to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide–de–camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.""","His Majesty, whose memory for faces is remarkable, was gracious enough to recall, when he noticed me in the front stalls, that I had had the honour of seeing him over a period of a few days at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had no thought of his Eastern throne – as you know, it fell to him as a result of a European congress; and he even had some serious hesitation about whether to accept it or not, as he saw it as not quite up to his lineage, which is the noblest in the whole of Europe, heraldically speaking. So an equerry brought me the command to go and greet His Majesty, and naturally I lost no time in complying."
"Pour un convalescent qui se repose tout le jour dans un jardin fleuri ou dans un verger, une odeur de fleurs et de fruits n’imprègne pas plus profondément les mille riens dont se compose son farniente que pour moi cette couleur, cet arôme que mes regards allaient chercher sur ces jeunes filles et dont la douceur finissait par s’incorporer à moi. Ainsi les raisins se sucrent-ils au soleil. Et par leur lente continuité, ces jeux si simples avaient aussi amené en moi, comme chez ceux qui ne font autre chose que rester étendus au bord de la mer, à respirer le sel, à se hâler, une détente, un sourire béat, un éblouissement vague qui avait gagné jusqu’à mes yeux.","For a convalescent who rests all day in a flowery garden or in an orchard, an odor of flowers and fruits does not permeate more deeply the thousand nothings of which his idleness is composed than for me this color, this aroma that my eyes were going to look for these young girls and whose sweetness ended up being incorporated into me. Thus the grapes are sweetened in the sun. And by their slow continuity, these so simple games had also brought in me, as in those who do nothing else but lie stretched out by the sea, to breathe the salt, to tan, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague dazzling that had reached my eyes.","For a convalescent who rests all day long in a flower–garden or orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes grow sugary in sunshine. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and growing sunburned, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague sense of dizziness that had spread from brain to eyes.","No convalescent who rests all day long in a flower-garden or an orchard is more aware of the scents of flowers and fruit, colouring the countless minutiae which sweeten his idle well-being, than I was of the tones and aromas that the presence of the girls fed to my feasting eyes, gradually permeating me with their deliciousness. Thus grapes mellow in the sunshine. The leisurely repetitiousness of the simple games we played had brought out in me, as in someone who just lies on a beach, relishing the salty air and the sun on the skin, a revelment in relaxation, a blissfully indulgent smile, an unfocussed daze of the delighted eyes."

"Le lendemain du jour où Robert m’avait ainsi parlé de son oncle tout en l’attendant, vainement du reste, comme je passais seul devant le casino en rentrant à l’hôtel, j’eus la sensation d’être regardé par quelqu’un qui n’était pas loin de moi. Je tournai la tête et j’aperçus un homme d’une quarantaine d’années, très grand et assez gros, avec des moustaches très noires, et qui, tout en frappant nerveusement son pantalon avec une badine, fixait sur moi des yeux dilatés par l’attention. Par moments, ils étaient percés en tous sens par des regards d’une extrême activité comme en ont seuls devant une personne qu’ils ne connaissent pas des hommes à qui, pour un motif quelconque, elle inspire des pensées qui ne viendraient pas à tout autre – par exemple, des fous ou des espions. Il lança sur moi une suprême œillade à la fois hardie, prudente, rapide et profonde, comme un dernier coup que l’on tire au moment de prendre la fuite, et après avoir regardé tout autour de lui, prenant soudain un air distrait et hautain, par un brusque revirement de toute sa personne il se tourna vers une affiche dans la lecture de laquelle il s’absorba, en fredonnant un air et en arrangeant la rose mousseuse qui pendait à sa boutonnière. Il sortit de sa poche un calepin sur lequel il eut l’air de prendre en note le titre du spectacle annoncé, tira deux ou trois fois sa montre, abaissa sur ses yeux un canotier de paille noire dont il prolongea le rebord avec sa main mise en visière comme pour voir si quelqu’un n’arrivait pas, fit le geste de mécontentement par lequel on croit faire voir qu’on a assez d’attendre, mais qu’on ne fait jamais quand on attend réellement, puis rejetant en arrière son chapeau et laissant voir une brosse coupée ras qui admettait cependant de chaque côté d’assez longues ailes de pigeon ondulées, il exhala le souffle bruyant des personnes qui ont non pas trop chaud mais le désir de montrer qu’elles ont trop chaud. J’eus l’idée d’un escroc d’hôtel qui, nous ayant peut-être déjà remarqués les jours précédents ma grand’mère et moi, et préparant quelque mauvais coup, venait de s’apercevoir que je l’avais surpris pendant qu’il m’épiait ; pour me donner le change, peut-être cherchait-il seulement par sa nouvelle attitude à exprimer la distraction et le détachement, mais c’était avec une exagération si agressive que son but semblait, au moins autant que de dissiper les soupçons que j’avais dû avoir, de venger une humiliation qu’à mon insu je lui eusse infligée, de me donner l’idée non pas tant qu’il ne m’avait pas vu, que celle que j’étais un objet de trop petite importance pour attirer l’attention. Il cambrait sa taille d’un air de bravade, pinçait les lèvres, relevait ses moustaches et dans son regard ajustait quelque chose d’indifférent, de dur, de presque insultant. Si bien que la singularité de son expression me le faisait prendre tantôt pour un voleur et tantôt pour un aliéné. Pourtant sa mise extrêmement soignée était beaucoup plus grave et beaucoup plus simple que celles de tous les baigneurs que je voyais à Balbec, et rassurante pour mon veston si souvent humilié par la blancheur éclatante et banale de leurs costumes de plage. Mais ma grand’mère venait à ma rencontre, nous fîmes un tour ensemble et je l’attendais, une heure après, devant l’hôtel où elle était rentrée un instant, quand je vis sortir Mme de Villeparisis avec Robert de Saint-Loup et l’inconnu qui m’avait regardé si fixement devant le casino. Avec la rapidité d’un éclair son regard me traversa, ainsi qu’au moment où je l’avais aperçu, et revint, comme s’il ne m’avait pas vu, se ranger, un peu bas, devant ses yeux, émoussé comme le regard neutre qui feint de ne rien voir au dehors et n’est capable de rien dire au dedans, le regard qui exprime seulement la satisfaction de sentir autour de soi les cils qu’il écarte de sa rondeur béate, le regard dévot et confit qu’ont certains hypocrites, le regard fat qu’ont certains sots. Je vis qu’il avait changé de costume. Celui qu’il portait était encore plus sombre ; et sans doute c’est que la véritable élégance est moins loin de la simplicité que la fausse ; mais il y avait autre chose : d’un peu près on sentait que si la couleur était presque entièrement absente de ces vêtements, ce n’était pas parce que celui qui l’en avait bannie y était indifférent, mais plutôt parce que pour une raison quelconque il se l’interdisait. Et la sobriété qu’ils laissaient paraître semblait de celles qui viennent de l’obéissance à un régime, plutôt que du manque de gourmandise. Un filet de vert sombre s’harmonisait dans le tissu du pantalon à la rayure des chaussettes avec un raffinement qui décelait la vivacité d’un goût maté partout ailleurs et à qui cette seule concession avait été faite par tolérance, tandis qu’une tache rouge sur la cravate était imperceptible comme une liberté qu’on n’ose prendre.","The day after Robert had talked to me about his uncle like this while waiting for him, in vain, as I was walking past the casino alone on my way back to the hotel, I had the feeling that someone was watching me. one who was not far from me. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather fat, with very black mustaches, who, while nervously hitting his trousers with a cane, was staring at me with eyes dilated by attention. At times, they were pierced in all directions by looks of an extreme activity as one has alone in front of a person whom they do not know men in whom, for some reason, she inspires thoughts which would not come at all. other – for example, madmen or spies. He cast a supreme glance at me, at once bold, cautious, quick and deep, like a last shot one fires when fleeing, and after having looked all around him, suddenly taking on a distracted and haughty air. , by a sudden change of whole person he turned to a poster in which he was absorbed, humming a tune and arranging the frothy rose which hung from his buttonhole. He took a notebook out of his pocket on which he seemed to be jotting down the title of the announced show, took out his watch two or three times, lowered a black straw boater's hat over his eyes, the edge of which he extended with his hand in visor as if to see if someone wasn't coming, made the gesture of displeasure by which one thinks to show that one has had enough to wait, but which one never does when one is really waiting, then throwing back his hat and revealing a close-cropped brush which nevertheless admitted on each side rather long wavy pigeon wings, he exhaled the noisy breath of people who are not too hot but the desire to show that they are too hot. I had the idea of a hotel crook who, having perhaps already noticed us the previous days my grandmother and I, and planning some bad trick, had just noticed that I had surprised him during that he spied on me; to deceive me, perhaps he was only seeking by his new attitude to express distraction and detachment, but it was with such an aggressive exaggeration that his aim seemed, at least as much as to dispel the suspicions that I must have had, to avenge a humiliation that I had inflicted on him without my knowledge, to give me the idea, not so much that he had not seen me, that I was an object of too little importance to draw attention. He arched his waist with an air of bravado, pursed his lips, raised his mustache, and there was something indifferent, harsh, almost insulting in his gaze. So much so that the singularity of his expression made me take him sometimes for a thief and sometimes for a lunatic. Yet his extremely neat attire was much more serious and much simpler than that of all the bathers I saw at Balbec, and reassuring for my jacket so often humiliated by the dazzling and banal whiteness of their beach costumes. But my grandmother was coming to meet me, we took a walk together and I was waiting for her, an hour later, in front of the hotel where she had returned for a moment, when I saw Madame de Villeparisis leave with Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so fixedly in front of the casino. With the rapidity of a flash his gaze passed through me, as when I had seen him, and returned, as if he had not seen me, to range himself, a little low, before his eyes, blunted. like the neutral gaze which pretends to see nothing on the outside and is capable of saying nothing on the inside, the gaze which expresses only the satisfaction of feeling around itself the eyelashes which it spreads with its blissful roundness, the devout gaze and confit that certain hypocrites have, the fat look that certain fools have. I saw that he had changed his costume. The one he wore was even darker; and no doubt it is because true elegance is less far from simplicity than false one; but there was something else: one could almost feel that if color was almost entirely absent from these garments, it was not because the one who had banished it from them was indifferent to them, but rather because for a some reason he forbade himself. And the sobriety they gave off seemed to come from obedience to a diet, rather than lack of greediness. A streak of dark green harmonized in the fabric of the trousers with the stripe of the socks with a refinement which betrayed the liveliness of a taste subdued everywhere else and to which this sole concession had been made out of tolerance, while a red stain on the tie was imperceptible like a liberty one does not dare to take.","The morning after Robert had told me all these things about his uncle, while he waited for him (and waited, as it happened, in vain), as I was coming by myself past the Casino on my way back to the hotel, I had the sensation of being watched by somebody who was not far off. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather stout, with a very dark moustache, who, nervously slapping the leg of his trousers with a switch, kept fastened upon me a pair of eyes dilated with observation. Every now and then those eyes were shot through by a look of intense activity such as the sight of a person whom they do not know excites only in men to whom, for whatever reason, it suggests thoughts that would not occur to anyone else—madmen, for instance, or spies. He trained upon me a supreme stare at once bold, prudent, rapid and profound, like a last shot which one fires at an enemy at the moment when one turns to flee, and, after first looking all round him, suddenly adopting an absent and lofty air, by an abrupt revolution of his whole body turned to examine a playbill on the wall in the reading of which he became absorbed, while he hummed a tune and fingered the moss–rose in his buttonhole. He drew from his pocket a note–book in which he appeared to be taking down the title of the performance that was announced, looked two or three times at his watch, pulled down over his eyes a black straw hat the brim of which he extended with his hand held out over it like a visor, as though to see whether some one were at last coming, made the perfunctory gesture of annoyance by which people mean to shew that they have waited long enough, although they never make it when they are really waiting, then pushing back his hat and exposing a scalp cropped close except at the sides where he allowed a pair of waved 'pigeon's–wings' to grow quite long, he emitted the loud panting breath that people give who are not feeling too hot but would like it to be thought that they were. He gave me the impression of a 'hotel crook' who had been watching my grandmother and myself for some days, and while he was planning to rob us had just discovered that I had surprised him in the act of spying; to put me off the scent, perhaps he was seeking only, by his new attitude, to express boredom and detachment, but it was with an exaggeration so aggressive that his object appeared to be—at least as much as the dissipating of the suspicions that I must have had of him—to avenge a humiliation which quite unconsciously I must have inflicted on him, to give me the idea not so much that he had not seen me as that I was an object of too little importance to attract his attention. He threw back his shoulders with an air of bravado, bit his lips, pushed up his moustache, and in the lens of his eyes made an adjustment of something that was indifferent, harsh, almost insulting. So effectively that the singularity of his expression made me take him at one moment for a thief and at another for a lunatic. And yet his scrupulously ordered attire was far more sober and far more simple than that of any of the summer visitors I saw at Balbec, and gave a reassurance to my own suit, so often humiliated by the dazzling and commonplace whiteness of their holiday garb. But my grandmother was coming towards me, we took a turn together, and I was waiting for her, an hour later, outside the hotel into which she had gone for a moment, when I saw emerge from it Mme. de Villeparisis with Robert de Saint–Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so intently outside the Casino. Swift as a lightning–flash his look shot through me, just as at the moment when I first noticed him, and returned, as though he had not seen me, to hover, slightly lowered, before his eyes, dulled, like the neutral look which feigns to see nothing without and is incapable of reporting anything to the mind within, the look which expresses merely the satisfaction of feeling round it the eyelids which it cleaves apart with its sanctimonious roundness, the devout, the steeped look that we see on the faces of certain hypocrites, the smug look on those of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes. The suit he was wearing was darker even than the other; and no doubt this was because the true distinction in dress lies nearer to simplicity than the false; but there was something more ; when one came near him one felt that if colour was almost entirely absent from these garments it was not because he who had banished it from them was indifferent to it but rather because for some reason he forbade himself the enjoyment of it. And the sobriety which they displayed seemed to be of the kind that comes from obedience to a rule of diet rather than from want of appetite. A dark green thread harmonised, in the stuff of his trousers, with the clock on his socks, with a refinement which betrayed the vivacity of a taste that was everywhere else conquered, to which this single concession had been made out of tolerance for such a weakness, while a spot of red on his necktie was imperceptible, like a liberty which one dares not take.","On the morning following the day when Robert told me these things about this expected uncle, who had eventually failed to materialize, I was walking back to the hotel when, right in front of the Casino, I had a sudden feeling of being looked at by someone at quite close quarters. I glanced round and saw a very tall, rather stout man of about forty, with a jet black moustache, who stood there nervously flicking a cane against the leg of his trousers and staring at me with eyes dilated by the strain of attention. At times, they seemed shot through with intense darting glances of a sort which, when directed towards a total stranger, can only ever be seen from a man whose mind is visited by thoughts that would never occur to anyone else, a madman, say, or a spy. He flashed a final look at me, like the parting shot from one who turns to run, daring, cautious, swift and searching; then, having gazed all about, with a sudden air of idle haughtiness, his whole body made a quick side-turn and he began a close study of a poster, humming the while and rearranging the moss rose in his buttonhole. From his pocket he produced a little note-book, and appeared to write down the title of the performance advertised; he looked a couple of times at his fob-watch; he pulled his black straw hat lower on his brow and held his hand to the rim of it like a visor, as though looking out for someone he was expecting; he made the gesture of irritation meant to suggest one has had enough of waiting about, but which one never makes when one has really been waiting; then, pushing back his hat to reveal close-cropped hair with rather long, waved side-wings, he breathed out noisily as people do, not when they are too hot, but when they wish it to be thought they are too hot. It crossed my mind that he might be a hotel-thief who, having perhaps noticed me and my grandmother over the last few days, and having some dishonest intent, had just realized I had noticed him while he was watching my movements; and, so as to put me off the scent, he may only have been trying to express absent-mindedness and nonchalance, but he did it with such marked exaggeration that his purpose appeared to be not just to disarm suspicion, but also to avenge some humiliation which I had inflicted upon him unawares, to make me think not so much that he had not seen me, but that I was so insignificant an object that he could not be bothered to pay the slightest attention to me. He had drawn himself up with a challenging air, setting his lips in a sneer, twirling his moustache and charging his eye with something hard and indifferent, something close to insulting. It was the strangeness of his expression which made me think he must be a thief, if not a madman. Yet his way of dressing, which was the acme of good taste, was both much more serious and much more simple than that of any of the bathers I saw at Balbec, as well as being something of a comfort to me in my suit, which had so often been humiliated by the bright and banal whiteness of their beach outfits. My grandmother now appeared and we went for a little walk. An hour later, she having gone back in for a moment, I was waiting for her outside the hotel when I saw Mme de Villeparisis come out in the company of Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me near the Casino. His glance flashed rapidly through me just as before; then, as though he had not seen me, it lowered, seemed to settle somewhere outside his eyes, dull and neutral, like a look which feigns to see nothing outside itself, and is incapable of seeing anything inside, the look expressing nothing but the satisfaction of knowing it is edged by eyelashes, among which it merely sits, roundly pleased with its own crass candour, the smug and sanctimonious look of certain hypocrites, the conceited look of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes: the suit he now wore was even darker than the other one – no doubt true elegance is closer to simplicity than is false elegance; but there was something else about him: at close range, one sensed that the almost complete absence of colour from his clothes came not from any indifference to colour, but because, for some reason, he deprived himself of it. The sobriety apparent in his clothing gave the impression of deriving from a self-imposed diet, rather than from any lack of appetite. In the fabric of his trousers, a fine stripe of dark green harmonized with a line visible in his socks, the refinement of this touch revealing the intensity of a preference which, though suppressed everywhere else, had been tolerated in that one form as a special concession, whereas a red design in the cravat remained as imperceptible as a liberty not quite taken, a temptation not quite succumbed to."
"– Eh bien, j’espère que vous vous mettez bien, que vous êtes un homme chic, lui dit le soir la femme du premier président.","""Well, I hope you're dressing well, that you're a smart man,"" the first president's wife said to him that evening.","""Well, I hope you've got on your best clothes; I hope you feel smart enough,"" was the magistrate's wife's greeting to him that evening.","‘So we’re hob-nobbing now, are we? the wife of the First President from Caen said to him that evening."
"Ce jeune homme qui avait l’air d’un aristocrate et d’un sportsman dédaigneux n’avait d’estime et de curiosité que pour les choses de l’esprit, surtout pour ces manifestations modernistes de la littérature et de l’art qui semblaient si ridicules à sa tante ; il était imbu d’autre part de ce qu’elle appelait les déclamations socialistes, rempli du plus profond mépris pour sa caste et passait des heures à étudier Nietsche et Proudhon. C’était un de ces « intellectuels » prompts à l’admiration, qui s’enferment dans un livre, soucieux seulement de haute pensée. Même, chez Saint-Loup, l’expression de cette tendance très abstraite et qui l’éloignait tant de mes préoccupations habituelles, tout en me paraissant touchante, m’ennuyait un peu. Je peux dire que, quand je sus bien qui avait été son père, les jours où je venais de lire des Mémoires tout nourris d’anecdotes sur ce fameux comte de Marsantes en qui se résume l’élégance si spéciale d’une époque déjà lointaine, l’esprit empli de rêveries, désireux d’avoir des précisions sur la vie qu’avait menée M. de Marsantes, j’enrageais que Robert de Saint-Loup au lieu de se contenter d’être le fils de son père, au lieu d’être capable de me guider dans le roman démodé qu’avait été l’existence de celui-ci, se fût élevé jusqu’à l’amour de Nietsche et de Proudhon. Son père n’eût pas partagé mes regrets. Il était lui-même un homme intelligent, excédant les bornes de sa vie d’homme du monde. Il n’avait guère eu le temps de connaître son fils, mais avait souhaité qu’il valût mieux que lui. Et je crois bien que contrairement au reste de la famille, il l’eût admiré, se fût réjoui qu’il délaissât ce qui avait fait ses minces divertissements pour d’austères méditations, et, sans en rien dire, dans sa modestie de grand seigneur spirituel, eût lu en cachette les auteurs favoris de son fils pour apprécier de combien Robert lui était supérieur.","This young man, who looked like an aristocrat and a disdainful sportsman, had esteem and curiosity only for things of the mind, especially for those modernist manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was also imbued with what she called socialist declamations, filled with the deepest contempt for his caste, and spent hours studying Nietsche and Proudhon. He was one of those ""intellectuals"" quick to admiration, who shut themselves up in a book, concerned only with high thought. Even, in Saint-Loup, the expression of this very abstract tendency, which distanced him so much from my usual preoccupations, while appearing to me touching, bored me a little. I can say that, when I knew who his father had been, the days when I had just read memoirs full of anecdotes about this famous Comte de Marsantes, which sums up the special elegance of an already distant era , my mind filled with daydreams, eager to have details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, I was furious that Robert de Saint-Loup, instead of being content with being his father's son, at the instead of being able to guide me in the old-fashioned novel that had been the existence of this one, would have risen to the love of Nietsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regrets. He was himself an intelligent man, exceeding the bounds of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to get to know his son, but had wished he was better than him. And I do believe that unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired him, would have been delighted that he had abandoned what had been his meager entertainments for austere meditations, and, without saying a word, in his modesty of great spiritual lord, would have secretly read his son's favorite authors to appreciate how much Robert was superior to him.","This young man who had the air of a scornful, sporting aristocrat had in fact no respect, no interest save for and in the things of the spirit, and especially those modern manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was imbued, moreover, with what she called 'Socialistic spoutings,' was filled with the most profound contempt for his caste and spent long hours in the study of Nietzsche and Proudhon. He was one of those intellectuals, quick to admire what is good, who shut themselves up in a book, and are interested only in pure thought. Indeed in Saint–Loup the expression of this highly abstract tendency, which removed him so far from my customary preoccupations, while it seemed to me touching, also annoyed me not a little. I may say that when I realised properly who had been his father, on days when I had been reading memoirs rich in anecdotes of that famous Comte de Marsantes, in whom were embodied the special graces of a generation already remote, the mind full of speculation—anxious to obtain fuller details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, it used to infuriate me that Robert de Saint–Loup, instead of being content to be the son of his father, instead of being able to guide me through the old–fashioned romance of what had been that father's existence, had trained himself to enjoy Nietzsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regret. He had been himself a man of brains, who had transcended the narrow confines of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to know his son, but had hoped that his son would prove a better man than himself. And I really believe that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired his son, would have rejoiced at his abandoning what had been his own small diversions for austere meditations, and without saying a word, in his modesty as a great gentleman endowed with brains, he would have read in secret his son's favourite authors in order to appreciate how far Robert was superior to himself.","The only things valued by this young man, who looked like an aristocrat and a supercilious sportsman, the only things which aroused his interest, were intellectual things, and especially those most modernistic examples of literature and art which his aunt thought so ludicrous. In addition, he was imbued with what she called the ‘haverings of the socialists’, spoke of his own class with heartfelt contempt and spent hours deep in Nietzsche and Proudhon.38 He was one of those ‘intellectuals’39 whose ready admiration keeps them immersed in books, satisfying a hunger for ideas. Actually, the manifestation of this very abstract tendency in Saint-Loup, which was at such a remove from my own usual mental activity, though it struck me as touching, also annoyed me somewhat. For instance, after I realized who his father was, if I happened to have been reading somebody’s memoirs full of anecdotes figuring the doings of the famous Comte de Marsantes, whom I saw as the epitome of the special elegance of a period already long past, in the mood of vague yearning aroused in me by the book I found it galling that my appetite for information on the life that M. de Marsantes had led must remain unsatisfied, because Robert de Saint-Loup, rather than being content to be a chip off the old block, rather than being able to lead me through the chapters of the outmoded romance of his father’s life, had aspired to familiarity with Nietzsche and Proudhon. Not that his father would have shared my regret. For he too had been an intelligent man, whose embrace of the world reached well beyond the fashionable Faubourg. He had had little time in which to become acquainted with his son, but had hoped he would turn out a better man than he was himself. I suspect that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired this son, would have rejoiced to see his own trivial pastimes exchanged for serious pursuits, and that, without a word to anyone, like the witty but modest nobleman he was, he would have dipped privately into his son’s favourite authors, so as to ascertain by how far Robert had outdistanced him."
"« C’est à croire qu’elle a copié cela, s’écria-t-elle quand elle eut fini. Jamais je n’aurais cru Gisèle capable de pondre un devoir pareil. Et ces vers qu’elle cite ! Où a-t-elle pu aller chiper ça ? » L’admiration d’Albertine, changeant il est vrai d’objet, mais encore accrue, ne cessa pas, ainsi que l’application la plus soutenue, de lui faire « sortir les yeux de la tête » tout le temps qu’Andrée consultée comme plus grande et comme plus calée, d’abord parla du devoir de Gisèle avec une certaine ironie, puis, avec un air de légèreté qui dissimulait mal un sérieux véritable, refit à sa façon la même lettre. « Ce n’est pas mal, dit-elle à Albertine, mais si j’étais toi et qu’on me donne le même sujet, ce qui peut arriver, car on le donne très souvent, je ne ferais pas comme cela. Voilà comment je m’y prendrais. D’abord si j’avais été Gisèle je ne me serais pas laissée emballer et j’aurais commencé par écrire sur une feuille à part mon plan. En première ligne la position de la question et l’exposition du sujet, puis les idées générales à faire entrer dans le développement. Enfin l’appréciation, le style, la conclusion. Comme cela, en s’inspirant d’un sommaire, on sait où on va. Dès l’exposition du sujet ou si tu aimes mieux, Titine, puisque c’est une lettre, dès l’entrée en matière, Gisèle a gaffé. Écrivant à un homme du XVIIe siècle Sophocle ne devait pas écrire : « Mon cher ami. » – Elle aurait dû, en effet, lui faire dire : mon cher Racine, s’écria fougueusement Albertine. Ç’aurait été bien mieux. – Non, répondit Andrée sur un ton un peu persifleur, elle aurait dû mettre : « Monsieur ». De même pour finir elle aurait dû trouver quelque chose comme : « Souffrez, Monsieur (tout au plus, cher Monsieur), que je vous dise ici les sentiments d’estime avec lesquels j’ai l’honneur d’être votre serviteur. » D’autre part, Gisèle dit que les chœurs sont dans Athalie une nouveauté. Elle oublie Esther, et deux tragédies peu connues, mais qui ont été précisément analysées cette année par le Professeur, de sorte que rien qu’en les citant, comme c’est son dada, on est sûre d’être reçue. Ce sont : Les Juives, de Robert Garnier, et l’Aman, de Montchrestien. » Andrée cita ces deux titres sans parvenir à cacher un sentiment de bienveillante supériorité qui s’exprima dans un sourire, assez gracieux, d’ailleurs. Albertine n’y tint plus : « Andrée, tu es renversante, s’écria-t-elle. Tu vas m’écrire ces deux titres-là. Crois-tu ? quelle chance si je passais là-dessus, même à l’oral, je les citerais aussitôt et je ferais un effet bœuf. » Mais dans la suite chaque fois qu’Albertine demanda à Andrée de lui redire les noms des deux pièces pour qu’elle les inscrivît, l’amie si savante prétendait les avoir oubliés et ne les lui rappela jamais. « Ensuite, reprit Andrée sur un ton d’imperceptible dédain à l’égard de camarades plus puériles, mais heureuse pourtant de se faire admirer et attachant à la manière dont elle aurait fait sa composition plus d’importance qu’elle ne voulait le laisser voir, Sophocle aux Enfers doit être bien informé. Il doit donc savoir que ce n’est pas devant le grand public, mais devant le Roi-Soleil et quelques courtisans privilégiés que fut représentée Athalie. Ce que Gisèle a dit à ce propos de l’estime des connaisseurs n’est pas mal du tout, mais pourrait être complété. Sophocle devenu immortel peut très bien avoir le don de la prophétie et annoncer que selon Voltaire Athalie ne sera pas seulement « le chef-d’œuvre de Racine, mais celui de l’esprit humain ». Albertine buvait toutes ces paroles. Ses prunelles étaient en feu. Et c’est avec l’indignation la plus profonde qu’elle repoussa la proposition de Rosemonde de se mettre à jouer. « Enfin, dit Andrée du même ton détaché, désinvolte, un peu railleur et assez ardemment convaincu, si Gisèle avait posément noté d’abord les idées générales qu’elle avait à développer, elle aurait peut-être pensé à ce que j’aurais fait, moi, montrer la différence qu’il y a dans l’inspiration religieuse des chœurs de Sophocle et de ceux de Racine. J’aurais fait faire par Sophocle la remarque que si les chœurs de Racine sont empreints de sentiments religieux comme ceux de la tragédie grecque, pourtant il ne s’agit pas des mêmes dieux. Celui de Joad n’a rien à voir avec celui de Sophocle. Et cela amène tout naturellement, après la fin du développement, la conclusion : « Qu’importe que les croyances soient différentes. » Sophocle se ferait un scrupule d’insister là-dessus. Il craindrait de blesser les convictions de Racine et glissant à ce propos quelques mots sur ses maîtres de Port-Royal, il préfère féliciter son émule de l’élévation de son génie poétique. »","""You'd think she copied that,"" she cried when she had finished. I would never have believed Gisèle capable of laying down such a duty. And those verses she quotes! Where could she have gotten that? Albertine's admiration, changing its object it is true, but still increasing, did not cease, like the most sustained application, to make her ""eyes pop out of her head"" all the time that Andrée consulted as taller and more knowledgeable, at first spoke of Gisèle's duty with a certain irony, then, with an air of levity which ill concealed a real seriousness, repeated the same letter in her own way. ""It's not bad,"" she said to Albertine, ""but if I were you and they gave me the same subject, which can happen, because they give it very often, I wouldn't do it like that. This is how I would go about it. First of all, if I had been Gisèle, I wouldn't have let myself get carried away and I would have started by writing my plan on a separate sheet. In the first line the position of the question and the exposition of the subject, then the general ideas to be included in the development. Finally the appreciation, the style, the conclusion. That way, by taking inspiration from a summary, we know where we are going. From the exposition of the subject or if you like better, Titine, since it is a letter, from the outset, Gisèle blundered. Writing to a man of the seventeenth century Sophocles was not to write: “My dear friend. ""She should, in fact, have made him say: my dear Racine,"" exclaimed Albertine passionately. It would have been much better. – No, replied Andrée in a somewhat mocking tone, she should have put: “Monsieur”. In the same way, in the end, she should have found something like: ""Suffer, Sir (at most, dear Sir), that I tell you here the feelings of esteem with which I have the honor to be your servant. On the other hand, Gisèle says that the choirs are something new in Athalie. She forgets Esther, and two little-known tragedies, but which have been precisely analyzed this year by the Professor, so that just by quoting them, as is her hobby, you are sure to be received. They are: Les Juives, by Robert Garnier, and l’Aman, by Montchrestien. Andrée quoted these two titles without managing to hide a feeling of benevolent superiority which expressed itself in a smile, quite gracious, moreover. Albertine could bear it no longer: “Andrée, you are stunning,” she cried. You are going to write me these two titles. Do you believe ? what a chance if I went over it, even orally, I would quote them immediately and I would have a jamming effect. But afterwards, each time that Albertine asked Andrée to tell her the names of the two pieces again so that she could write them down, the learned friend pretended to have forgotten them and never reminded her of them. “Afterwards, Andrée went on in a tone of imperceptible disdain towards more childish comrades, but nevertheless happy to be admired and endearing in the way in which she would have made her composition more important than she wanted to leave it. see, Sophocles in the Underworld must be knowledgeable. He must therefore know that it was not in front of the general public, but in front of the Sun King and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was represented. What Gisèle said about the esteem of connoisseurs is not bad at all, but could be completed. Sophocles, having become immortal, may very well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire, Athalie will not only be ""Racine's masterpiece, but that of the human spirit"". Albertine drank in all these words. His pupils were on fire. And it was with the deepest indignation that she rejected Rosemonde's proposal to start playing. ""Finally,"" said Andrée in the same detached, offhand tone, a little mocking and quite fervently convinced, ""if Gisèle had calmly noted first the general ideas she had to develop, she might have thought of what I would have makes me show the difference there is in the religious inspiration of the choirs of Sophocles and those of Racine. I would have had Sophocles remark that if Racine's choruses are imbued with religious feelings like those of Greek tragedy, yet they are not the same gods. That of Joad has nothing to do with that of Sophocles. And that leads quite naturally, after the end of the development, to the conclusion: “It doesn’t matter that the beliefs are different. Sophocles would scruple to insist on this. He was afraid of hurting Racine's convictions and slipping a few words on this subject about his masters at Port-Royal, he preferred to congratulate his emulator on the elevation of his poetic genius. »","Really, you'd think she must have cribbed it somewhere! "" she exclaimed, as she reached the end. ""I should never have believed that Gisèle could hatch out anything like as good! And the poetry she brings in! Where on earth can she have got that from?"" Albertine's admiration, with a change, it is true, of object, but with no loss—an increase, rather—of intensity, combined with the closest attention to what was being said, continued to make her eyes 'start from her head' all the time that Andrée (consulted as being the biggest of the band and more knowledgeable than the others) first of all spoke of Gisèle's essay with a certain irony, then with a levity of tone which failed to conceal her underlying seriousness proceeded to reconstruct the letter in her own way. ""It is not badly done,"" she told Albertine, ""but if I were you and had the same subject set me, which is quite likely, as they do very often set that, I shouldn't do it in that way. This is how I would tackle it. Well, first of all, if I had been Gisèle, I should not have let myself get tied up, I should have begun by making a rough sketch of what I was going to write on a separate piece of paper. On the top line I should state the question and give an account of the subject, then the general ideas to be worked into the development. After that, appreciation, style, conclusion. In that way, with a summary to refer to, you know where you are. But at the very start, where she begins her account of the subject, or, if you like, Titine, since it's a letter we're speaking of, where she comes to the matter, Gisèle has gone off the rails altogether. Writing to a person of the seventeenth century, Sophocles ought never to have said, 'My dear friend.'"" ""Why, of course, she ought to have said, 'My dear Racine,'"" came impetuously from Albertine. "" That would have been much better."" ""No,"" replied Andrée, with a trace of mockery in her tone, ""she ought to have put 'Sir.' In the same way, to end up, she ought to have thought of something like, 'Suffer me, Sir,' (at the very most, 'Dear Sir') to inform you of the sense of high esteem with which I have the honour to be your servant.' Then again, Gisèle says that the choruses in Athalie are a novelty. She is forgetting Esther, and two tragedies that are not much read now but happen to have been analysed this year by the Professor himself, so that you need only mention them, since he's got them on the brain, and you're bound to pass. I mean Les Juives, by Robert Gamier, and Montchrestien's L'Aman. "" Andrée quoted these titles without managing quite to conceal a secret sense of benevolent superiority, which found expression in a smile, quite a delightful smile, for that matter. Albertine could contain herself no—longer. "" Andrée, you really are a perfect marvel,"" she cried. ""You must write down those names for me. Just fancy, what luck it would be if I got on to that, even in the oral, I should bring them in at once and make a colossal impression."" But in the days that followed, every time that Albertine begged Andrée just to tell her again the names of those two plays so that she might write them down, her blue–stocking friend seemed most unfortunately to have forgotten them, and left her none the wiser. "" And another thing,"" Andrée went on with the faintest note in her voice of scorn for companions so much younger than herself, though she relished their admiration and attached to the manner in which she herself would have composed the essay a greater importance than she wanted us to think, ""Sophocles in the Shades must be kept well–informed of all that goes on. He must know, therefore, that it was not before the general public but before the King's Majesty and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was first played. What Gisèle says in this connexion of the esteem of qualified judges is not at all bad, but she might have gone a little further. Sophocles, now that he is immortal, might quite well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire, Athalie is to be the supreme achievement not of Racine merely but of the human mind. "" Albertine was drinking in every word. Her eyes blazed. And it was with the utmost indignation that she rejected Rosemonde's suggestion that they should begin to play. "" And so,"" Andrée concluded, in the same easy, detached tone, blending a faint sneer with a certain warmth of conviction, ""if Gisèle had noted down properly, first of all, the general ideas that she was going to develop, it might perhaps have occurred to her to do what I myself should have done, point out what a difference there is between the religious inspiration of Sophocles's choruses and Racine's. I should have made Sophocles remark that if Racine's choruses are instinct with religious feeling like those of the Greek Tragedians, the gods are not the same. The God of Joad has nothing in common with the god of Sophocles. And that brings us quite naturally, when we have finished developing the subject, to our conclusion: What does it matter if their beliefs are different? Sophocles would hesitate to insist upon such a point. He would be afraid of wounding Racine's convictions, and so, slipping in a few appropriate words on his masters at Port–Royal, he prefers to congratulate his disciple on the loftiness of his poetic genius.""","I bet you she copied it! I wouldn’t think Gisèle could write a thing like this all by herself. I mean, look at the poetry she quotes – where do you think she pinched it?’ Her admiration, now shifting its focus to Andrée, continued to make her eyes ‘start out of her head’, as did the close attention she paid to Andrée’s words, when the latter, in her capacity as the most senior and the best at French, commented on Gisèle’s essay with a touch of irony at first, then redrafted the letter in her own way, with an air of light-heartedness which barely concealed true earnestness. ‘It’s not bad, she said to Albertine. But if I were you, having to write on that subject – and that’s perfectly possible, you know, because it’s one they set quite a lot – I wouldn’t do it like that. Here’s what I’d do: for one thing, if I’d been Gisèle, I wouldn’t have plunged in straight away. I’d have started by writing out my plan on a separate page: on the first line, the statement of the question and the setting out of the subject. Next, the broad ideas to be brought into the discussion. And then at the end, the appreciation, the style and the conclusion. If you follow an outline like that, you always know where you’re going. You see, Titine, right from the setting out of the subject, or if you like, since it’s a letter, right from the opening salutation, Gisèle went and muffed it. I mean, if he’s writing to a man in the seventeenth century, Sophocles shouldn’t say “Dear Racine”. – I know! Albertine interjected, full of passion. She should’ve made him say “My dear Monsieur Racine”. That’d be much better. – Not at all, Andrée replied in a slightly supercilious voice. She should have put just “Sir”. And at the end she should have put something like “While assuring you of the high esteem in which I hold you, I remain, Sir (or at the most Dear Sir), yours etc.” Also, Gisèle says the chorus is a novelty in Athalie, but she’s forgetting Esther, as well as two other little-known tragedies that the examiner himself has just written an analysis of this year! So he’s got a real bee in his bonnet about them and all anyone has to do to pass is mention them: they’re called Les juives by Robert Gamier and Aman by Antoine de Montchrestien. ’110 As she spoke these names and titles, Andrée was unable to conceal a little smirk of indulgent self-satisfaction, which was not without charm. Albertine burst out: ‘Andrée, you’re a wonder! Write down those two titles for me. Just think – if I got that subject, even just in the oral exam, I could quote them straight away and really take his breath away!’ (After that, every time Albertine asked Andrée to say the names and titles again, so that she could make a note of them, her well-read friend said she had forgotten them; and she never in fact repeated them.) ‘The next thing,’ Andrée said, in a tone of faint disdain for these more childish friends, though glad of their admiration, and investing more self-esteem than she meant to show in this matter of how she would have dealt with the essay, ‘is that Sophocles in the Underworld is bound to be well informed – he must know that Athalie wasn’t performed for the vulgar, but for the Sun King himself and a few privileged courtiers. Mind you, what Gisèle says about true connoisseurs is really quite good, but it doesn’t go far enough. I mean, Sophocles is now immortal, so it would be quite all right for him to have the gift of second sight, and be able to predict that Voltaire will come along and say Athalie is “not just the masterpiece of Racine, but of the whole human spirit”.’111 Albertine, her eyes glowing with concentration, was not missing a single word of what Andrée was saying: she declined indignantly Rosemonde’s suggestion that they should start a game. ‘ And then,’ Andrée said, in the same detached, casual voice, with a tone of slight mockery and rather heart-felt conviction, ‘if Gisèle had bothered to note down the broad ideas she was going to include in her discussion, she might have thought of doing what I would have done: show the difference in religious inspiration between Sophocles’ chorus and Racine ’s. I’d have made Sophocles point out that though Racine’s chorus is as full of religious feeling as the choruses in Greek tragedy, it’s not for the same gods. The God of Joad has got nothing to do with the god of Sophocles. And that would lead naturally into the concluding question, after the end of the development, “What does it matter that the beliefs are not the same?” Sophocles would make a point of insisting on this, not wishing to hurt Racine’s feelings, and would then slip in a few words about the latter’s masters at Port-Royal, by way of congratulating his rival on his high-minded poetic spirit.’"
"Quant au professeur Cottard, on le reverra, longuement, beaucoup plus loin, chez la Patronne, au château de la Raspelière. Qu’il suffise actuellement, à son égard, de faire observer ceci : pour Swann, à la rigueur le changement peut surprendre puisqu’il était accompli et non soupçonné de moi quand je voyais le père de Gilberte aux Champs-Élysées, où d’ailleurs ne m’adressant pas la parole il ne pouvait faire étalage devant moi de ses relations politiques (il est vrai que s’il l’eût fait, je ne me fusse peut-être pas aperçu tout de suite de sa vanité car l’idée qu’on s’est faite longtemps d’une personne bouche les yeux et les oreilles ; ma mère pendant trois ans ne distingua pas plus le fard qu’une de ses nièces se mettait aux lèvres que s’il eût été invisiblement dissous entièrement dans un liquide ; jusqu’au jour où une parcelle supplémentaire, ou bien quelque autre cause amena le phénomène appelé sursaturation ; tout le fard non aperçu cristallisa, et ma mère, devant cette débauche soudaine de couleurs déclara, comme on eût fait à Combray, que c’était une honte, et cessa presque toute relation avec sa nièce). Mais pour Cottard au contraire, l’époque où on l’a vu assister aux débuts de Swann chez les Verdurin était déjà assez lointaine ; or les honneurs, les titres officiels viennent avec les années ; deuxièmement, on peut être illettré, faire des calembours stupides, et posséder un don particulier qu’aucune culture générale ne remplace, comme le don du grand stratège ou du grand clinicien. Ce n’est pas seulement en effet comme un praticien obscur, devenu, à la longue, notoriété européenne, que ses confrères considéraient Cottard. Les plus intelligents d’entre les jeunes médecins déclarèrent – au moins pendant quelques années, car les modes changent étant nées elles-mêmes du besoin de changement – que si jamais ils tombaient malades, Cottard était le seul maître auquel ils confieraient leur peau. Sans doute ils préféraient le commerce de certains chefs plus lettrés, plus artistes, avec lesquels ils pouvaient parler de Nietzsche, de Wagner. Quand on faisait de la musique chez Mme Cottard, aux soirées où elle recevait, avec l’espoir qu’il devînt un jour doyen de la Faculté, les collègues et les élèves de son mari, celui-ci, au lieu d’écouter, préférait jouer aux cartes dans un salon voisin. Mais on vantait la promptitude, la profondeur, la sûreté de son coup d’œil, de son diagnostic. En troisième lieu, en ce qui concerne l’ensemble de façons que le professeur Cottard montrait à un homme comme mon père, remarquons que la nature que nous faisons paraître dans la seconde partie de notre vie n’est pas toujours, si elle l’est souvent, notre nature première développée ou flétrie, grossie ou atténuée ; elle est quelquefois une nature inverse, un véritable vêtement retourné. Sauf chez les Verdurin qui s’étaient engoués de lui, l’air hésitant de Cottard, sa timidité, son amabilité excessives, lui avaient, dans sa jeunesse, valu de perpétuels brocards. Quel ami charitable lui conseilla l’air glacial ? L’importance de sa situation lui rendit plus aisé de le prendre. Partout, sinon chez les Verdurin où il redevenait instinctivement lui-même, il se rendit froid, volontiers silencieux, péremptoire quand il fallait parler, n’oubliant pas de dire des choses désagréables. Il put faire l’essai de cette nouvelle attitude devant des clients qui, ne l’ayant pas encore vu, n’étaient pas à même de faire des comparaisons, et eussent été bien étonnés d’apprendre qu’il n’était pas un homme d’une rudesse naturelle. C’est surtout à l’impassibilité qu’il s’efforçait, et même dans son service d’hôpital, quand il débitait quelques-uns de ces calembours qui faisaient rire tout le monde, du chef de clinique au plus récent externe, il le faisait toujours sans qu’un muscle bougeât dans sa figure d’ailleurs méconnaissable depuis qu’il avait rasé barbe et moustaches.","As for Professor Cottard, we will see him again, at length, much further on, at the Patronne, at the Château de la Raspelière. Suffice it now, with regard to him, to observe this: for Swann, if need be, the change may surprise since he was accomplished and not suspected of me when I saw Gilberte's father on the Champs-Élysées, where elsewhere, not speaking to me, he could not flaunt in front of me his political connections (it is true that if he had done so, I might not have noticed his vanity right away because the The idea that we have long had of a person clogs our eyes and ears; my mother for three years could no more distinguish the make-up that one of her nieces put on her lips than if it had been completely dissolved invisibly. in a liquid; until the day when an additional particle, or else some other cause brought about the phenomenon called supersaturation; all the unperceived make-up crystallized, and my mother, faced with this sudden riot of colors declared, as one would have done at Combray, that it was a disgrace, and almost ceased all relationship with his ni ecce). But for Cottard, on the contrary, the time when we saw him attend Swann's debut with the Verdurins was already quite distant; now the honors, the official titles come with the years; secondly, one can be illiterate, make stupid puns, and possess a special gift that no general culture can replace, like the gift of the great strategist or the great clinician. It was not only as an obscure practitioner, who had become, in the long run, European notoriety, that his colleagues considered Cottard. The cleverest of the young doctors declared – at least for a few years, for changing fashions being themselves born of the need for change – that if they ever fell ill, Cottard was the only master to whom they would entrust their skin. No doubt they preferred the business of certain more literate, more artistic leaders, with whom they could talk about Nietzsche, Wagner. When we played music at Madame Cottard's, at parties where she received, with the hope that he would one day become dean of the Faculty, her husband's colleagues and pupils, the latter, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in a neighboring salon. But they praised the promptness, the depth, the certainty of his eye, of his diagnosis. Thirdly, with regard to the set of ways that Professor Cottard showed a man like my father, let us notice that the nature that we make appear in the second part of our life is not always, if it is often, our first nature developed or withered, magnified or attenuated; it is sometimes an inverse nature, a veritable garment turned inside out. Except among the Verdurins who had become infatuated with him, Cottard's hesitant air, his shyness, his excessive friendliness, had, in his youth, earned him perpetual taunts. What charitable friend advised him the icy air? The importance of his situation made it easier for him to take it. Everywhere, except at the Verdurins' where he instinctively became himself again, he was cold, deliberately silent, peremptory when it was necessary to speak, never forgetting to say disagreeable things. He was able to try out this new attitude in front of customers who, having not yet seen him, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been very surprised to learn that he was not a a man of natural roughness. It was especially impassivity that he strove for, and even in his hospital ward, when he spouted some of those puns that made everyone laugh, from the head of the clinic to the most recent outpatient, he always did it without a muscle moving in his otherwise unrecognizable face since he had shaved off his beard and mustache.","As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the 'Mistress,' Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspelière. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte's father in the Champs–Elysées, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one's eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super–saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace—such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert—for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also—that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard's, on the evenings when she entertained—in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty—the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard's hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins', where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache.","As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again eventually, and at some length, at La Raspelière, the château of the Patronne. For the moment, let the following remark suffice. The change in Swann may well be surprising, since it had already come about, albeit without my knowledge, by the time I had become familiar with him as the father of Gilberte, at the Champs-Élysées; and then, of course, as he never spoke to me, he could not brag about his connections in the political world. (And even if he had done so, I might well not have been immediately aware of his vanity, as one’s long-standing mental image of others deprives one of sight and hearing in their presence – my mother took three years to notice the lip-stick that one of her nieces was using; for all she could see, it might have been totally and invisibly dissolved, till the day when either an extra dab of it or some other cause brought about the reaction known as supersaturation: all the unseen lip-stick crystallized and, in the face of this sudden splash of colour, my mother declared, after the manner of Combray, that it was a disgrace, and all but broke off relations with the girl.) With Cottard, however, the days when we saw him witnessing Swann’s introduction to the Verdurins were long past. Honours and official titles come with the years. Also, it is possible to be unread, and to like making silly puns, while having a special gift which outweighs any general culture, such as the gift of the great strategist or the great clinician. So Cottard was seen by his medical colleagues not just as an obscure practitioner who had eventually risen to celebrity throughout Europe. The cleverest of the younger doctors declared – for a few years at any rate, since all fashions, having arisen from a desire for change, eventually pass away for the same reason – that if ever they should fall ill, Cottard was the only eminent man to whom they would entrust their persons. Obviously, for conversation, they preferred the company of certain other senior colleagues who were more cultivated or more artistically minded, and with whom they could discuss Nietzsche or Wagner. At Mme Cottard’s musical evenings, to which she invited students and colleagues of her husband’s in the hope that he would one day become Dean of the Faculty, Cottard himself never listened to a note, preferring to play cards in one of the other rooms. But he was renowned for his diagnostic skill, for the unhesitating acuity and accuracy of his eye. In addition, in considering the general effect that Cottard’s manners made on someone like my father, it should be noted that the nature we display in the second part of our life may not always be, though it often is, a growth from or a stunting of our first nature, an exaggeration or attenuation of it. It is at times an inversion of it, a garment turned inside out. In youth, everyone except the Verdurins, who had taken a great fancy to him, had mercilessly mocked him for his hesitant air, his excessive diffidence and affability. Did some kind friend suggest he adopt an icy demeanour? The eminence of his position certainly made it easy for him to comply. Except at the Verdurins’, where he instinctively became himself again, he now made a show of being cold and taciturn; when speech was required, he was brusque and made a point of saying unpleasant things. He first tried his new manner on patients who had no prior acquaintance with him, who could therefore make no comparisons and who would have been amazed to learn that he was not a man to whom such abruptness came naturally. He aimed first and foremost at being impassive; and even when he made some of his puns doing the rounds in the hospital, making everyone laugh, from the medical superintendent to the newest student, he would always do it without moving a muscle in his face, which, since he had shaved off his beard and moustache, was also quite unrecognizable."
– Et alors qu’est votre oncle ?,"""And then who is your uncle?""","""Then who is this uncle?""",So what’s your uncle?
"C’est un grand charme ajouté à la vie dans une station balnéaire comme était Balbec, si le visage d’une jolie fille, une marchande de coquillages, de gâteaux ou de fleurs, peint en vives couleurs dans notre pensée, est quotidiennement pour nous dès le matin le but de chacune de ces journées oisives et lumineuses qu’on passe sur la plage. Elles sont alors, et par là, bien que désœuvrées, alertes comme des journées de travail, aiguillées, aimantées, soulevées légèrement vers un instant prochain, celui où tout en achetant des sablés, des roses, des ammonites, on se délectera à voir, sur un visage féminin, les couleurs étalées aussi purement que sur une fleur. Mais au moins, ces petites marchandes, d’abord, on peut leur parler, ce qui évite d’avoir à construire avec l’imagination les autres côtés que ceux que nous fournit la simple perception visuelle, et à recréer leur vie, à s’exagérer son charme, comme devant un portrait ; surtout, justement parce qu’on leur parle, on peut apprendre où, à quelles heures on peut les retrouver. Or il n’en était nullement ainsi pour moi en ce qui concernait les jeunes filles de la petite bande. Leurs habitudes m’étant inconnues, quand certains jours je ne les apercevais pas, ignorant la cause de leur absence, je cherchais si celle-ci était quelque chose de fixe, si on ne les voyait que tous les deux jours, ou quand il faisait tel temps, ou s’il y avait des jours où on ne les voyait jamais. Je me figurais d’avance ami avec elles et leur disant : « Mais vous n’étiez pas là tel jour ? – Ah ! oui, c’est parce que c’était un samedi, le samedi nous ne venons jamais parce que… » Encore si c’était aussi simple que de savoir que le triste samedi il est inutile de s’acharner, qu’on pourrait parcourir la plage en tous sens, s’asseoir à la devanture du pâtissier, faire semblant de manger un éclair, entrer chez le marchand de curiosités, attendre l’heure du bain, le concert, l’arrivée de la marée, le coucher du soleil, la nuit, sans voir la petite bande désirée. Mais le jour fatal ne revenait peut-être pas une fois par semaine. Il ne tombait peut-être pas forcément un samedi. Peut-être certaines conditions atmosphériques influaient-elles sur lui ou lui étaient-elles entièrement étrangères. Combien d’observations patientes, mais non point sereines, il faut recueillir sur les mouvements en apparence irréguliers de ces mondes inconnus avant de pouvoir être sûr qu’on ne s’est pas laissé abuser par des coïncidences, que nos prévisions ne seront pas trompées, avant de dégager les lois certaines, acquises au prix d’expériences cruelles, de cette astronomie passionnée. Me rappelant que je ne les avais pas vues le même jour qu’aujourd’hui, je me disais qu’elles ne viendraient pas, qu’il était inutile de rester sur la plage. Et justement je les apercevais. En revanche, un jour où, autant que j’avais pu supposer que des lois réglaient le retour de ces constellations, j’avais calculé devoir être un jour faste, elles ne venaient pas. Mais à cette première incertitude si je les verrais ou non le jour même venait s’en ajouter une plus grave, si je les reverrais jamais, car j’ignorais en somme si elles ne devaient pas partir pour l’Amérique, ou rentrer à Paris. Cela suffisait pour me faire commencer à les aimer. On peut avoir du goût pour une personne. Mais pour déchaîner cette tristesse, ce sentiment de l’irréparable, ces angoisses, qui préparent l’amour, il faut – et il est peut-être ainsi, plutôt que ne l’est une personne, l’objet même que cherche anxieusement à étreindre la passion – le risque d’une impossibilité. Ainsi agissaient déjà ces influences qui se répètent au cours d’amours successives, pouvant du reste se produire, mais alors plutôt dans l’existence des grandes villes, au sujet d’ouvrières dont on ne sait pas les jours de congé et qu’on s’effraye de ne pas avoir vues à la sortie de l’atelier, ou du moins qui se renouvelèrent au cours des miennes. Peut-être sont-elles inséparables de l’amour ; peut-être tout ce qui fut une particularité du premier vient-il s’ajouter aux suivants, par souvenir, suggestion, habitude et, à travers les périodes successives de notre vie, donner à ses aspects différents un caractère général.","It is a great charm added to life in a seaside resort like Balbec, if the face of a pretty girl, a seller of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in bright colors in our thoughts, is daily for us in the morning the goal of each of these idle and luminous days that one spends on the beach. They are then, and thereby, although idle, alert as days of work, shunted, magnetized, lifted slightly towards a coming moment, the one where while buying shortbread, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing, on a female face, the colors spread out as purely as on a flower. But at least these little merchants, first of all, we can talk to them, which avoids having to construct with the imagination other sides than those provided by simple visual perception, and to recreate their lives, to s to exaggerate its charm, as in front of a portrait; above all, precisely because we talk to them, we can learn where, at what times we can find them. But it was by no means so for me as far as the young girls of the little band were concerned. Their habits being unknown to me, when on certain days I did not see them, ignoring the cause of their absence, I sought to see if this was something fixed, if they were only seen every other day, or when it was such weather, or if there were days when you never saw them. I pictured myself in advance as friends with them and saying to them: “But you weren’t there on such a day? – Ah! yes, it's because it was a Saturday, on Saturday we never come because..."" Even if it were as simple as knowing that on a sad Saturday there is no point in struggling, that we could go through the beach in all directions, sit in front of the pastry chef, pretend to eat an éclair, enter the curio shop, wait for bath time, the concert, the arrival of the tide, the sunset , at night, without seeing the desired small band. But perhaps the fatal day did not come once a week. It might not necessarily fall on a Saturday. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced him or were entirely foreign to him. How many patient but not serene observations must be collected on the seemingly irregular movements of these unknown worlds before we can be sure that we have not allowed ourselves to be deceived by coincidences, that our forecasts will not be deceived? , before releasing the certain laws, acquired at the cost of cruel experiences, of this passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not seen them on the same day as today, I told myself that they would not come, that it was useless to stay on the beach. And precisely I saw them. On the other hand, one day when, as far as I had been able to suppose that laws regulated the return of these constellations, I had calculated that it should be a lucky day, they did not come. But to this first uncertainty whether I would see them or not that same day was added a more serious one, whether I would ever see them again, because I did not know in fact whether they should leave for America or return to Paris. . That was enough to make me start loving them. One can have taste for a person. But to unleash this sadness, this feeling of the irreparable, these anxieties, which prepare love, it is necessary – and it is perhaps thus, rather than a person, the very object that anxiously seeks to embrace passion – the risk of an impossibility. Thus were already acting those influences which are repeated in the course of successive loves, being able moreover to occur, but then rather in the existence of large cities, on the subject of working women whose days off are unknown and whom one is frightened not to have seen at the exit of the workshop, or at least which were renewed during mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps all that was peculiar to the first is added to the following, by memory, suggestion, habit and, through the successive periods of our life, giving its different aspects a general character.","It adds a great charm to life in a watering–place like Balbec if the face of a pretty girl, a vendor of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in vivid colours in our mind, is regularly, from early morning, the purpose of each of those leisured, luminous days which we spend upon the beach. They become then, and for that reason, albeit unoccupied by any business, as alert as working–days, pointed, magnetised, raised slightly to meet an approaching moment, that in which, while we purchase sand–cakes, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing upon a feminine face its colours displayed as purely as on a flower. But at least, with these little traffickers, first of all we can speak to them, which saves us from having to construct with our imagination their aspects other than those with which the mere visual perception of them furnishes us, and to recreate their life, magnifying its charm, as when we stand before a portrait; moreover, just because we speak to them, we can learn where and at what time it will be possible to see them again. Now I had none of these advantages with respect to the little band. Their habits were unknown to me; when on certain days I failed to catch a glimpse of them, not knowing the cause of their absence I sought to discover whether it was something fixed and regular, if they were to be seen only every other day, or in certain states of the weather, or if there were days on which no one ever saw them. I imagined myself already friends with them, and saying: "" But you weren't there the other day?"" ""Weren't we? Oh, no, of course not ; that was because it was a Saturday. On Saturdays we don't ever come, because…"" If it were only as simple as that, to know that on black Saturday it was useless to torment oneself, that one might range the beach from end to end, sit down outside the pastry– cook's and pretend to be nibbling an éclair, poke into the curiosity shop, wait for bathing time, the concert, high tide, sunset, night, all without seeing the longed–for little band. But the fatal day did not, perhaps, come once a week. It did not, perhaps, of necessity fall on Saturdays. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced it or were entirely unconnected with it. How many observations, patient but not at all serene, must one accumulate of the movements, to all appearance irregular, of those unknown worlds before being able to be sure that one has not allowed oneself to be led astray by mere coincidence, that one's forecasts will not be proved wrong, before one elucidates the certain laws, acquired at the cost of so much painful experience, of that passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not yet seen them on some particular day of the week, I assured myself that they would not be coming, that it was useless to wait any longer on the beach. And at that very moment I caught sight of them. And yet on another day which, so far as I could suppose that there were laws that guided the return of those constellations, must, I had calculated, prove an auspicious day, they did not come. But to this primary uncertainty whether I should see them or not that day, there was added another, more disquieting: whether I should ever set eyes on them again, for I had no reason, after all, to know that they were not about to sail for America, or to return to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to love them. One can feel an attraction towards a particular person. But to release that fount of sorrow, that sense of the irreparable, those agonies which prepare the way for love, there must be—and this is, perhaps, more than any person can be, the actual object which our passion seeks so anxiously to embrace—the risk of an impossibility. Thus there were acting upon me already those influences which recur in the course of our successive love–affairs, which can, for that matter, be provoked (but then rather in the life of cities) by the thought of little working girls whose half–holiday is we know not on what day, and whom we are afraid of having missed as they came out of the factory; or which at least have recurred in mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps everything that formed a distinctive feature of our first love attaches itself to those that come after, by recollection, suggestion, habit, and through the successive periods of our life gives to its different aspects a general character.","The life we lead in a seaside resort such as Balbec can acquire much charm if the sight of a pretty face, a seller of sea-shells, a florist, a girl in a cake-shop, painted in its vivid colours in our morning memory, becomes the aim of each of the sunlit days we idle away on the sands. It is this aim which makes them, though holidays, as busy as working-days, marked by directions and destinations, tending always towards the coming moment, when in buying our ammonites, our shortbread or our roses, we can delight in the colours of a feminine face, as pure and clear as those of a flower. But with shop-girls, at least one can chat, which avoids the necessity of filling in by imagination all the aspects of them not directly perceptible to the eye, of inventing a life for them and exaggerating the charm of it, as though extrapolating from a mere portrait; and for another thing, for the very reason that they can be chatted with, one can learn where and when to meet them. This, of course, was nothing like the position I was in with the girls of the little gang. On days when I did not see them, as their habits were unknown to me, I was in total ignorance of the possible cause of their non-appearance: did they only come every second day, or in certain weather, or were there days when they were never to be seen? I imagined being their future friend and being able to say, ‘But you didn’t come on such-and-such a day? – True, because it was a Saturday, and we never come on Saturdays because …’ Not that it was as simple as just knowing that on sad Saturdays it was futile to hope against hope, that I could walk up and down the beach, sit in the window-seat of the cake-shop, pretend to eat an eclair, wander into the curiosity shop, moon about waiting for it to be time to go for a bathe, listen to the concert, watch the fishing-boats come in, see the sunset, then nightfall, and still not have seen the little group I longed for. For it was possible the dreaded day did not come round once a week. Nor might it be a Saturday. Certain atmospheric conditions might have an influence on it – or conversely, might have nothing at all to do with it. How many patient, but not dispassionate, observations must be recorded about the apparently erratic movements of these unknown worlds, before one can be sure of having ruled out misleading coincidences, of having confirmed one’s predictions, and being able to draw up the infallible laws, arrived at through cruel experience, of this passionate astronomy! I would remember that I had not seen them on this day last week, and concluded that they would not appear, that it was pointless to stay down on the beach. And then I would see them! But then, on another day which, in so far as I could detect the functioning of laws in the recurrences of their constellation, I had calculated must be an auspicious one, they did not appear. Then my initial uncertainty about whether I would see them or not on a particular day was aggravated by another, much more serious one, whether I would see them ever again – for all I knew, they might be leaving for America or returning to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to fall in love with them. Having a liking for someone is one thing; but to be afflicted with the sadness, the feeling of something irreparable having happened, the anguish which all accompany the onset of love, what is necessary is the risk – which may even be the object to which passion in its fretfulness tries to cling, rather than to a person – of an impossibility. These forces were already working within me, and they revive each time one falls in love (they can in fact attach themselves, though usually this only happens in town life, to working-class girls, if one is unaware of their day off and fails to see them leaving the factory at the end of the day’s work), or at least that is what happened with my successive love affairs. Perhaps such forces are inseparable from all love: it may be that whatever particularities were present in our first experience of it become incorporated into the following ones, by the workings of memory, suggestion or habit, and that, throughout the consecutive periods of our existence, they give a common character to its different phases."
"Au reste, Swann ne se contentait pas de chercher dans la société telle qu’elle existe et en s’attachant aux noms que le passé y a inscrits et qu’on peut encore y lire, un simple plaisir de lettré et d’artiste, il goûtait un divertissement assez vulgaire à faire comme des bouquets sociaux en groupant des éléments hétérogènes, en réunissant des personnes prises ici et là. Ces expériences de sociologie amusante (ou que Swann trouvait telle) n’avaient pas sur toutes les amies de sa femme – du moins d’une façon constante – une répercussion identique. « J’ai l’intention d’inviter ensemble les Cottard et la duchesse de Vendôme », disait-il en riant à Mme Bontemps, de l’air friand d’un gourmet qui a l’intention et veut faire l’essai de remplacer dans une sauce les clous de girofle par du poivre de Cayenne. Or ce projet qui allait paraître en effet plaisant, dans le sens ancien du mot, aux Cottard, avait le don d’exaspérer Mme Bontemps. Elle avait été récemment présentée par les Swann à la duchesse de Vendôme et avait trouvé cela aussi agréable que naturel. En tirer gloire auprès des Cottard, en le leur racontant, n’avait pas été la partie la moins savoureuse de son plaisir. Mais comme les nouveaux décorés qui, dès qu’ils le sont, voudraient voir se fermer aussitôt le robinet des croix, Mme Bontemps eût souhaité qu’après elle personne de son monde à elle ne fût présenté à la princesse. Elle maudissait intérieurement le goût dépravé de Swann qui lui faisait, pour réaliser une misérable bizarrerie esthétique, dissiper d’un seul coup toute la poudre qu’elle avait jetée aux yeux des Cottard en leur parlant de la duchesse de Vendôme. Comment allait-elle même oser annoncer à son mari que le professeur et sa femme allaient à leur tour avoir leur part de ce plaisir qu’elle lui avait vanté comme unique ? Encore si les Cottard avaient pu savoir qu’ils n’étaient pas invités pour de bon, mais pour l’amusement. Il est vrai que les Bontemps l’avaient été de même, mais Swann ayant pris à l’aristocratie cet éternel donjuanisme qui entre deux femmes de rien fait croire à chacune que ce n’est qu’elle qu’on aime sérieusement, avait parlé à Mme Bontemps de la duchesse de Vendôme comme d’une personne avec qui il était tout indiqué qu’elle dînât. « Oui, nous comptons inviter la princesse avec les Cottard, dit, quelques semaines plus tard Mme Swann, mon mari croit que cette conjonction pourra donner quelque chose d’amusant » car si elle avait gardé du « petit noyau » certaines habitudes chères à Mme Verdurin, comme de crier très fort pour être entendue de tous les fidèles, en revanche, elle employait certaines expressions – comme « conjonction » – chères au milieu Guermantes duquel elle subissait ainsi à distance et à son insu, comme la mer le fait pour la lune, l’attraction, sans pourtant se rapprocher sensiblement de lui. « Oui, les Cottard et la duchesse de Vendôme, est-ce que vous ne trouvez pas que cela sera drôle ? » demanda Swann. « Je crois que ça marchera très mal et que ça ne vous attirera que des ennuis, il ne faut pas jouer avec le feu », répondit Mme Bontemps, furieuse. Elle et son mari furent, d’ailleurs, ainsi que le prince d’Agrigente, invités à ce dîner, que Mme Bontemps et Cottard eurent deux manières de raconter, selon les personnes à qui ils s’adressaient. Aux uns, Mme Bontemps de son côté, Cottard du sien, disaient négligemment quand on leur demandait qui il y avait d’autre au dîner : « Il n’y avait que le prince d’Agrigente, c’était tout à fait intime. » Mais d’autres, risquaient d’être mieux informés (même une fois quelqu’un avait dit à Cottard : « Mais est-ce qu’il n’y avait pas aussi les Bontemps ? – Je les oubliais », avait en rougissant répondu Cottard au maladroit qu’il classa désormais dans la catégorie des mauvaises langues). Pour ceux-là les Bontemps et les Cottard adoptèrent chacun sans s’être consultés une version dont le cadre était identique et où seuls leurs noms respectifs étaient interchangés. Cottard disait : « Eh bien, il y avait seulement les maîtres de maison, le duc et la duchesse de Vendôme – (en souriant avantageusement) le professeur et Mme Cottard, et, ma foi, du diable si on a jamais su pourquoi, car ils allaient là comme des cheveux sur la soupe, M. et Mme Bontemps. » Mme Bontemps récitait exactement le même morceau, seulement c’était M. et Mme Bontemps qui étaient nommés avec une emphase satisfaite, entre la duchesse de Vendôme et le prince d’Agrigente, et les pelés qu’à la fin elle accusait de s’être invités eux-mêmes et qui faisaient tache, c’était les Cottard.","Moreover, Swann was not content to seek in society as it exists and by attaching himself to the names which the past has inscribed there and which one can still read there, a simple pleasure of the scholar and of the artist, he tasted a fairly vulgar entertainment to be made like social bouquets by grouping heterogeneous elements, by bringing together people caught here and there. These experiments in amusing sociology (or which Swann found such) did not have an identical impact on all of his wife's friends – at least in a constant way. ""I intend to invite the Cottards and the Duchess of Vendôme together,"" he said, laughing to Madame Bontemps, with the fond air of a gourmet who intends and wants to try replace cloves with cayenne pepper in a sauce. Now this plan, which was indeed going to appear pleasant, in the old sense of the word, to the Cottards, had the gift of exasperating Madame Bontemps. She had recently been introduced by the Swanns to the Duchess of Vendome and had found it as pleasant as it was natural. To draw glory from it with the Cottards, by telling it to them, had not been the less savory part of his pleasure. But like the newly decorated who, as soon as they are decorated, would like to see the tap of the crosses immediately shut off, Madame Bontemps would have liked that after her no one from her world would be presented to the Princess. She inwardly cursed Swann's depraved taste which made her, in order to achieve a wretched aesthetic oddity, dissipate all at once all the powder she had thrown in the eyes of the Cottards by speaking to them of the Duchesse de Vendôme. How was she even going to dare to announce to her husband that the professor and his wife were in turn going to have their share of this pleasure which she had praised to him as unique? Even if the Cottards had been able to know that they were not invited for good, but for fun. It is true that the Bontemps had been the same, but Swann, having taken from the aristocracy that eternal Donjuanism which between two worthless women makes each believe that it is only she whom one loves seriously, had spoken to Madame Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vendome as of a person with whom it was quite appropriate that she should dine. ""Yes, we are planning to invite the Princess with the Cottards, said Mme. Verdurin, like shouting very loudly to be heard by all the faithful, on the other hand, she used certain expressions – such as “conjunction” – dear to the Guermantes milieu, to which she thus suffered from a distance and without her knowing it, as the sea does for the moon, the attraction, without however approaching him noticeably. ""Yes, the Cottards and the Duchess of Vendome, don't you think that will be funny?"" Swann asked. ""I think it will work very badly and that it will only get you in trouble, you must not play with fire,"" replied Madame Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, moreover, like the Prince of Agrigente, invited to this dinner, which Madame Bontemps and Cottard had two ways of relating, according to the persons to whom they were speaking. To some, Madame Bontemps on her side, Cottard on hers, said carelessly when they were asked who else was at dinner: “There was only the Prince of Agrigente, it was quite intimate. But others risked being better informed (even once someone had said to Cottard: ""But weren't there also the Bontemps? - I had forgotten them"", had blushed replied Cottard to the awkward whom he now classified in the category of gossip). For these, the Bontemps and the Cottards each adopted without consulting each other a version whose framework was identical and where only their respective names were interchanged. Cottard said: ""Well, there were only the masters of the house, the Duke and Duchess of Vendôme - (smiling favorably) the professor and Mme Cottard, and, my faith, the devil if we ever knew why, because they went there like hair on soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps. Madame Bontemps recited exactly the same piece, only it was Monsieur and Madame Bontemps who were named with satisfied emphasis, between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d'Agrigente, and the peles whom at the end she accused of o be invited themselves and who made a mark, it was the Cottards.","But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These experiments in the lighter side (or what was to Swann the lighter side) of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife's friends. ""I'm thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vendôme,"" he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vendôme, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards', when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced (to herself, of course) the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vendôme. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal 'Don Juan' spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. "" Yes, we're determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,"" said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; ""My husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction. "" For if she had retained from the 'little nucleus' certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain expressions, such as 'conjunction,' which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. "" Yes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vendôme. Don't you think that might be rather fun?"" asked Swann. ""I think they'll be exceedingly ill–assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn't to play with fire, is what I say!"" snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d'Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: ""Only the Prince d'Agrigente; it was all quite intimate."" But there were others who might, alas, be better informed (once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: "" But weren't the Bontemps there too?"" ""Oh, I forgot them,"" Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil). For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. "" Let me see;"" Cottard would say, ""there were our host and hostess, the Duc and Duchesse de Vendôme—"" (with a satisfied smile) "" Professor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!"" Mme. Bontemps would recite an exactly similar 'piece,' only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d'Agrigente, while the 'also ran,' whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards.","However, the pleasure Swann derived from his social contacts was not just the straightforward kind enjoyed by the cultivated man with an artistic bent who restricts himself to society as it is constituted, and enjoys his familiarity with the names engraved in it by the past and still legible now. He also took a rather vulgar enjoyment in making as it were composite posies out of disparate elements, bringing together people from very different backgrounds. These experiments in the sociology of entertainment, which is how he saw them, did not have exactly the same effect – or rather did not have a constant effect – on all the ladies who visited his wife. He would say with a laugh to Mme Bontemps, ‘I’m thinking of having the Cottards to dinner with the Duchesse de Vendôme,’ looking like a gourmet whose mouth waters at the novel undertaking of adding Cayenne pepper to a particular sauce instead of the usual cloves. But this design of Swann’s, though it would certainly strike the Cottards as entertaining, was calculated to appear quite outrageous to Mme Bontemps. She, having herself only recently been introduced by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vendôme, and having deemed this occurrence to be as pleasing as it was natural, had found that impressing the Cottards by telling them all about it had been not the least of the pleasures it afforded her. But like those who, as soon as their own names figure in the latest Honours List, would like to see the supply of such decorations run dry, Mme Bontemps would have been better pleased if, after she had been presented to the Duchesse de Vendôme, nobody else from her circle could be. She secretly cursed Swann for the warped taste with which, merely to satisfy a misplaced aesthetic curiosity, he had wantonly squandered all the kudos she had seen reflected in the eyes of the Cottards as she told them about the Duchesse de Vendôme. Would she even have the heart to tell her own husband that Professor Cottard and his wife were now to partake of the very pleasure which she had assured him was unique to themselves? If the Cottards could only learn that their invitation was not seriously meant, but had been sent just for fun! The fact was that the Bontemps had been sent their invitation for exactly the same reason; but then Swann, who had borrowed from the aristocracy Don Juan’s undying gift for fooling each of two commonplace women into believing she is the only one he really loves, had assured Mme Bontemps that to dine with a woman such as the Duchesse de Vendôme, no one could be better qualified than herself. ‘Yes’ Mme Swann said some weeks later, ‘we’re thinking of having the Duchesse de Vendôme with the Cottards. My husband thinks it’s a conjugation that might produce some quite entertaining results’ Though Odette had retained from her days in ‘the little clan’ some habits dear to Mme Verdurin, like shouting so as to be heard by all the ‘regulars’, she had also picked up words such as ‘conjugation’ dear to the Guermantes set, which, as the moon does to the sea, exercised its power on her from a distance without her knowing it – and without her coming any closer to it, either. ‘ Yes,’ Swann said, ‘the Cottards with the Duchesse de Vendôme – that should be good fun, don’t you think?’ To which Mme Bontemps replied tartly, ‘I think it’s quite preposterous! It’s playing with fire, nothing good will come of it and it will serve you right!’ In fact, she and her husband37 were also invited to the dinner in question, as was the Prince d’Agrigente; and both Mme Bontemps and Dr Cottard took to describing the event in two different ways, depending on the identity of those to whom they described it. To the first group, Mme Bontemps on the one hand and Dr Cottard on the other both replied casually when asked who else had been there, ‘Oh, just the Prince d’Agrigente. It was very restricted, you know, very select.’ The other group were those who might be better informed than the first – one of them had even asked Cottard, ‘But surely the Bontemps were there as well? – Ah, yes, I’d forgotten them,’ Cottard replied, with a blush and a mental note to classify this person as a pernicious gossip. For the benefit of this second group, both Mme Bontemps and Dr Cottard, quite independently of each other, had a version which was identical in plot, but in which their names featured in reverse order. Dr Cottard’s version ran like this: ‘Well, there were our hosts, of course, then the Vendômes, the Duc and Duchesse, don’t you know, and (here he gave a smug smile) Professor and Mme Cottard. Oh yes, and there was another couple there too, though nobody could work out why – M. and Mme Bontemps, sticking out like the proverbial sore thumb!’ Mme Bontemps rattled off exactly the same speech, except that the gloating intonation stressed the place of her husband and herself between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d’Agrigente, while the disreputables who she went so far as to say had gate-crashed the event, and who were such flagrant outsiders, were the Cottards."
"– Tu sais ce que je t’ai dit. Maintenant, fais ce que tu voudras.","""You know what I told you. Now do what you want.","At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: ""You heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.""","‘Well, you’ve heard what I had to say. Now you must do as you see fit.’"
"Il raconta qu’une demeure qui avait appartenu à sa famille, où Marie-Antoinette avait couché, dont le parc était de Lenôtre, appartenait maintenant aux riches financiers Israël, qui l’avaient achetée. « Israël, du moins c’est le nom que portent ces gens, qui me semble un terme générique, ethnique, plutôt qu’un nom propre. On ne sait pas peut-être que ce genre de personnes ne portent pas de noms et sont seulement désignées par la collectivité à laquelle elles appartiennent. Cela ne fait rien ! Avoir été la demeure des Guermantes et appartenir aux Israël ! ! ! s’écria-t-il. Cela fait penser à cette chambre du château de Blois où le gardien qui le faisait visiter me dit : « C’est ici que Marie Stuart faisait sa prière ; et c’est là maintenant où ce que je mets mes balais. » Naturellement je ne veux rien savoir de cette demeure qui s’est déshonorée, pas plus que de ma cousine Clara de Chimay qui a quitté son mari. Mais je conserve la photographie de la première encore intacte, comme celle de la princesse quand ses grands yeux n’avaient encore de regards que pour mon cousin. La photographie acquiert un peu de la dignité qui lui manque quand elle cesse d’être une reproduction du réel et nous montre des choses qui n’existent plus. Je pourrai vous en donner une, puisque ce genre d’architecture vous intéresse », dit-il à ma grand’mère. À ce moment apercevant que le mouchoir brodé qu’il avait dans sa poche laissait dépasser des liserés de couleur, il le rentra vivement avec la mine effarouchée d’une femme pudibonde mais point innocente dissimulant des appâts que, par un excès de scrupule, elle juge indécents. – Imaginez-vous, reprit-il, que ces gens ont commencé par détruire le parc de Lenôtre, ce qui est aussi coupable que de lacérer un tableau de Poussin. Pour cela, ces Israël devraient être en prison. Il est vrai, ajouta-t-il en souriant après un moment de silence, qu’il y a sans doute tant d’autres choses pour lesquelles ils devraient y être ! En tous cas vous vous imaginez l’effet que produit devant ces architectures un jardin anglais.","He related that a residence which had belonged to his family, where Marie-Antoinette had slept, whose park was Lenôtre, now belonged to the rich financiers Israel, who had bought it. “Israel, at least that’s the name these people have, which seems to me a generic, ethnic term, rather than a proper name. We may not know that this kind of people do not have names and are only designated by the community to which they belong. It does not matter ! To have been the home of the Guermantes and to belong to Israel! ! ! he cried. It reminds me of this room in the Château de Blois where the guardian who showed it around said to me: “It is here that Marie Stuart said her prayers; and that's where I put my brooms now. ""Naturally I don't want to know anything about this house which has dishonored itself, any more than about my cousin Clara de Chimay who left her husband. But I keep the photograph of the first still intact, like that of the princess when her big eyes only had eyes for my cousin. Photography acquires some of the dignity it lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shows us things that no longer exist. I could give you one, since this kind of architecture interests you,” he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief he had in his pocket showed edging of color, he tucked it in quickly with the frightened expression of a prudish but not innocent woman concealing baits which, out of an excess of scruple, she judge indecent. “Imagine,” he went on, “that these people began by destroying Lenôtre Park, which is as culpable as lacerating a picture by Poussin. For that, these Israel should be in prison. It's true, he added smiling after a moment of silence, that there are probably so many other things they should be there for! In any case, you can imagine the effect produced in front of these architectures by an English garden.","He told us how a house that had belonged to his family, in which Marie Antoinette had slept, with a park laid out by Le Nôtre, was now in the hands of the Israels, the wealthy financiers, who had bought it. "" Israel—at least that is the name these people go by, which seems to me a generic, a racial term rather than a proper name. One cannot tell; possibly people of that sort do not have names, and are designated only by the collective title of the tribe to which they belong. It is of no importance! But fancy, after being a home of the Guermantes, to belong to Israels!!! "" His voice rose. ""It reminds me of a room in the Château of Blois where the caretaker who was shewing me over said: 'This is where Mary Stuart used to say her prayers; I use it to keep my brooms in.' Naturally I wish to know nothing more of this house that has let itself be dishonoured, any more than of my cousin Clara de Chimay after she left her husband. But I keep a photograph of the house, when it was still unspoiled, just as I keep one of the Princess before her large eyes had learned to gaze on anyone but my cousin. A photograph acquires something of the dignity which it ordinarily lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shews us things that no longer exist. I could give you a copy, since you are interested in that style of architecture,"" he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief which he had in his pocket was shewing some coloured threads, he thrust it sharply down out of sight with the scandalised air of a prudish but far from innocent lady concealing attractions which, by an excess of scrupulosity, she regards as indecent. ""Would you believe,"" he went on, ""that the first thing the creatures did was to destroy Le Nôtre's park, which is as bad as slashing a picture by Poussin? For that alone, these Israels ought to be in prison. It is true,"" he added with a smile, after a moment's silence, ""that there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be there! In any case, you can imagine the effect, with that architecture behind it, of an English garden.""","He spoke of an estate which had once belonged to his family, with a house in which Marie-Antoinette had slept and a park designed by Le Nôtre,63 now in the possession of the Israels, the wealthy financiers who had bought it. ‘ Israel, at least that’s the name borne by the persons in question, although it does seem to me to be not a proper name, but a generic or ethnic term. Who knows, it may be that such people do not have names. Perhaps they are identified only in so far as they belong to a particular grouping? However! he shrieked. Just think – to have been the dwelling of the Guermantes and to be owned by the Israels! It puts one in mind of the room in the château at Blois where the guide showing you round says, “And now this ’ere is where your Mary Queen of Scots used to say her prayers and now it’s where I keeps me brooms”. Naturally, I now have not the slightest wish to have any knowledge of that house which has disgraced itself, just as I have no desire for contact with my cousin Clara de Chimay, who has left her husband.64 However, I do keep a photograph of the house as it was when unsullied, just as I have one of the Princesse de Chimay taken at a time when her great eyes were full of no one but my cousin. Photography acquires a certain dignity, which it does not normally have, when it is not just a reproduction of reality, but can show us things which no longer exist. I could give you a copy,’ he added to my grandmother, ‘since you have an interest in that manner of architecture.’ At that moment, noticing that his embroidered handkerchief was revealing part of its coloured edging, he thrust it back into his pocket with a startled glance, like a prudish but not innocent woman concealing bodily charms which in her excessive modesty she sees as wanton. ‘Can you credit, he said, that the first thing those Israel persons did was lay waste Le Nôtre’s park? Why, it’s like defacing a canvas by Poussin! The place for such people is behind bars. Although, of course, he added with a smile after a moment of silence, there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be behind bars! However! I leave to your imagination the effect produced by an English-style garden in front of the architecture of such a house!"
"Sans doute en ces années-là encore si peu éloignées, ce n’était pas comme la veille dans leur première apparition devant moi, la vision du groupe, mais le groupe lui-même qui manquait de netteté. Alors, ces enfants trop jeunes étaient encore à ce degré élémentaire de formation où la personnalité n’a pas mis son sceau sur chaque visage. Comme ces organismes primitifs où l’individu n’existe guère par lui-même, est plutôt constitué par le polypier que par chacun des polypes qui le composent, elles restaient pressées les unes contre les autres. Parfois l’une faisait tomber sa voisine, et alors un fou rire qui semblait la seule manifestation de leur vie personnelle, les agitait toutes à la fois, effaçant, confondant ces visages indécis et grimaçants dans la gelée d’une seule grappe scintillatrice et tremblante. Dans une photographie ancienne qu’elles devaient me donner un jour, et que j’ai gardée, leur troupe enfantine offre déjà le même nombre de figurantes, que plus tard leur cortège féminin ; on y sent qu’elles devaient déjà faire sur la plage une tache singulière qui forçait à les regarder, mais on ne peut les y reconnaître individuellement que par le raisonnement, en laissant le champ libre à toutes les transformations possibles pendant la jeunesse jusqu’à la limite où ces formes reconstituées empiéteraient sur une autre individualité qu’il faut identifier aussi et dont le beau visage, à cause de la concomitance d’une grande taille et de cheveux frisés, a chance d’avoir été jadis ce ratatinement de grimace rabougrie présenté par la carte-album ; et la distance parcourue en peu de temps par les caractères physiques de chacune de ces jeunes filles faisant d’eux un critérium fort vague, et d’autre part ce qu’elles avaient de commun et comme de collectif étant dès lors marqué, il arrivait parfois à leurs meilleures amies de les prendre l’une pour l’autre sur cette photographie, si bien que le doute ne pouvait finalement être tranché que par tel accessoire de toilette que l’une était certaine d’avoir porté, à l’exclusion des autres. Depuis ces jours si différents de celui où je venais de les voir sur la digue, si différents et pourtant si proches, elles se laissaient encore aller au rire comme je m’en étais rendu compte la veille, mais à un rire qui n’était pas celui intermittent et presque automatique de l’enfance, détente spasmodique qui autrefois faisait à tous moments faire un plongeon à ces têtes comme les blocs de vairons dans la Vivonne se dispersaient et disparaissaient pour se reformer un instant après ; leurs physionomies maintenant étaient devenues maîtresses d’elles-mêmes, leurs yeux étaient fixés sur le but qu’ils poursuivaient ; et il avait fallu hier l’indécision et le tremblé de ma perception première pour confondre indistinctement, comme l’avaient fait l’hilarité ancienne et la vieille photographie, les sporades aujourd’hui individualisées et désunies du pâle madrépore.","No doubt in those years still so close, it was not like the day before in their first appearance in front of me, the vision of the group, but the group itself which lacked clarity. So these too-young children were still at that elementary stage of formation where personality did not put its stamp on every face. As these primitive organisms where the individual hardly exists by himself, is rather constituted by the polypary than by each of the polyps which compose it, they remained pressed against each other. Sometimes one made her neighbor fall, and then a wild laughter which seemed to be the only manifestation of their personal life shook them all at once, obliterating, confusing those indecisive and grimacing faces in the jelly of a single scintillating and trembling cluster. . In an old photograph that they were to give me one day, and which I have kept, their children's troupe already offers the same number of extras as later their female procession; one feels there that they must already have made a singular spot on the beach which forced one to look at them, but one can only recognize them individually there by reasoning, leaving the field open to all the possible transformations during youth until the limit where these reconstituted forms would encroach on another individuality that must also be identified and whose beautiful face, because of the concomitance of a large size and curly hair, is likely to have once been this shrivelling stunted grimace presented by card-album; and the distance traveled in a short time by the physical characteristics of each of these young girls making them a very vague criterion, and on the other hand what they had in common and as collective being therefore marked, it happened sometimes to their best friends to take them one for the other in this photograph, so much so that the doubt could ultimately only be settled by such and such a toilet accessory that one of them was certain to have worn, excluding others. Since those days so different from the one when I had just seen them on the dyke, so different and yet so close, they still allowed themselves to laugh as I had realized the day before, but to a laugh that was not not that intermittent and almost automatic of childhood, the spasmodic relaxation which formerly made these heads take a plunge at all times like the blocks of minnows in the Vivonne dispersed and disappeared to re-form a moment later; their faces now had become mistresses of themselves, their eyes were fixed on the goal they were pursuing; and it had taken yesterday the indecision and the trembling of my first perception to confuse indiscriminately, as the old hilarity and the old photograph had done, the now individualized and disunited sporades of the pale madrepore.","No doubt, in those earlier years that were still so recent, it was not, as it had been yesterday when they appeared for the first time before me, one's impression of the group, but the group itself that had been lacking in clearness. Then those children, mere babies, had been still at that elementary stage in their formation when personality has not set its seal on every face. Like those primitive organisms in which the individual barely exists by itself, consists in the reef rather than in the coral insects that compose it, they were still pressed one against another. Sometimes one pushed her neighbour over, and then a wild laugh, which seemed the sole manifestation of their personal life, convulsed them all at once, obliterating, confounding those indefinite, grinning faces in the congealment of a single cluster, scintillating and tremulous. In an old photograph of themselves, which they were one day to give me, and which I have kept ever since, their infantile troop already presents the same number of participants as, later, their feminine procession; one can see from it that their presence must, even then, have made on the beach an unusual mark which forced itself on the attention; but one cannot recognise them individually in it save by a process of reasoning, leaving a clear field to all the transformations possible during girlhood, up to the point at which one reconstructed form would begin to encroach upon another individuality, which must be identified also, and whose handsome face, owing to the accessories of a large build and curly hair, may quite possibly have been, once, that wizened and impish little grin which the photograph album presents to us; and the distance traversed in a short interval of time by the physical characteristics of each of these girls making of them a criterion too vague to be of any use, whereas what they had in common and, so to speak, collectively, had at that early date been strongly marked, it sometimes happened that even their most intimate friends mistook one for another in this photograph, so much so that the question could in the last resort be settled only by some detail of costume which one of them could be certain that she herself, and not any of the others, had worn. Since those days, so different from the day on which I had just seen them strolling along the 'front,' so different and yet so close in time, they still gave way to fits of laughter, as I had observed that afternoon, but to laughter of a kind that was no longer the intermittent and almost automatic laughter of childhood, a spasmodic discharge which, in those days, had continually sent their heads dipping out of the circle, as the clusters of minnows in the Vivonne used to scatter and vanish only to gather again a moment later; each countenance was now mistress of itself, their eyes were fixed on the goal towards which they were marching; and it had taken, yesterday, the indecision and tremulousness of my first impression to make me confuse vaguely (as their childish hilarity and the old photograph had confused) the spores now individualised and disjoined of the pale madrepore.","No doubt, at that time, so few years before, it was not the vision of the group which lacked clarity, as it had been the day before when they first appeared to me, but the group itself. In those days, the girls were too young to have gone beyond the elementary degree of formation of self, when personality has not yet stamped its seal on each face. Like primitive organisms in which the individual hardly exists, or rather in which it is constituted more by the polypary than by each of its component polyps, they lived in a close conglomerate, huddled together. One of them would suddenly push another one over, and a fit of the giggles, which seemed to be the only manifestation in them of personal life, convulsed them all at once, masking and unifying the undefined, grimacing faces in the sparkle and translucency of a single, quivering cluster. In an old photograph which they subsequently gave me, and which I have kept, their pack of children numbers no fewer of them than were to figure later in their feminine company; it suggests that even then the blur of colour they made on the beach was remarkable enough to make eyes turn towards them, but in order to recognize any of them individually, one must resort to deduction, try to imagine the whole range of their possible transformations during later childhood, up to the point at which their remodelled forms started to coincide with another individual set of features, which one must attempt to identify also in the beautiful face (now accompanied by full height and hair that is waved) that might once have belonged to the photo’s wizened and grimacing gnome; and the distance covered in so short a time by the physical characteristics of each of the girls was such an unreliable criterion – in addition to which, their collectiveness, so to speak, and the things they had in common, were already so marked – that even their best friends could look at that photograph and mistake them for one another; with the result that the uncertainty could be dispelled only by the presence of some article of clothing which one of them knew without a doubt that she, and not one of the others, had worn. Different though those earlier days were from the day when I had seen them on the esplanade – different, yet so close to it – the girls still enjoyed laughing with gusto, as I had noticed the day before; but this laughter was not the intermittent and almost automatic sort indulged in by children, the spasmodic release which had once made the whole group of heads duck down as one, as a block of minnows in the Vivonne used to dive and disintegrate, before reforming a moment later; their individual faces had now become capable of self-mastery, their eyes remaining fixed throughout on the aim they pursued; and the day before, it had been only my indecision and the vacillation of my initial perception which, like their former hilarity and the old photo, had fused into an indistinct whole the now individualized and separated sister stars of the pale madrepore."
"C’était moins aussi peut-être. Comme un jeune homme, un jour d’examen ou de duel, trouve le fait sur lequel on l’a interrogé, la balle qu’il a tirée, bien peu de chose quand il pense aux réserves de science et de courage qu’il possède et dont il aurait voulu faire preuve, de même mon esprit qui avait dressé la Vierge du Porche hors des reproductions que j’en avais eues sous les yeux, inaccessible aux vicissitudes qui pouvaient menacer celles-ci, intacte si on les détruisait, idéale, ayant une valeur universelle, s’étonnait de voir la statue qu’il avait mille fois sculptée réduite maintenant à sa propre apparence de pierre, occupant par rapport à la portée de mon bras une place où elle avait pour rivales une affiche électorale et la pointe de ma canne, enchaînée à la Place, inséparable du débouché de la grand’rue, ne pouvant fuir les regards du café et du bureau d’omnibus, recevant sur son visage la moitié du rayon de soleil couchant – et bientôt, dans quelques heures, de la clarté du réverbère – dont le bureau du Comptoir d’Escompte recevait l’autre moitié, gagnée, en même temps que cette succursale d’un établissement de crédit, par le relent des cuisines du pâtissier, soumise à la tyrannie du Particulier au point que, si j’avais voulu tracer ma signature sur cette pierre, c’est elle, la Vierge illustre que jusque-là j’avais douée d’une existence générale et d’une intangible beauté, la Vierge de Balbec, l’unique (ce qui, hélas ! voulait dire la seule), qui, sur son corps encrassé de la même suie que les maisons voisines, aurait, sans pouvoir s’en défaire, montré à tous les admirateurs venus là pour la contempler la trace de mon morceau de craie et les lettres de mon nom, et c’était elle enfin, l’œuvre d’art immortelle et si longtemps désirée, que je trouvais, métamorphosée ainsi que l’église elle-même, en une petite vieille de pierre dont je pouvais mesurer la hauteur et compter les rides. L’heure passait, il fallait retourner à la gare où je devais attendre ma grand’mère et Françoise pour gagner ensemble Balbec-Plage. Je me rappelais ce que j’avais lu sur Balbec, les paroles de Swann : « C’est délicieux, c’est aussi beau que Sienne. » Et n’accusant de ma déception que des contingences, la mauvaise disposition où j’étais, ma fatigue, mon incapacité de savoir regarder, j’essayais de me consoler en pensant qu’il restait d’autres villes encore intactes pour moi, que je pourrais prochainement peut-être pénétrer, comme au milieu d’une pluie de perles, dans le frais gazouillis des égouttements de Quimperlé, traverser le reflet verdissant et rose qui baignait Pont-Aven ; mais pour Balbec, dès que j’y étais entré, ç’avait été comme si j’avais entr’ouvert un nom qu’il eût fallu tenir hermétiquement clos et où, profitant de l’issue que je leur avais imprudemment offerte en chassant toutes les images qui y vivaient jusque-là, un tramway, un café, les gens qui passaient sur la place, la succursale du Comptoir d’Escompte, irrésistiblement poussés par une pression externe et une force pneumatique, s’étaient engouffrés à l’intérieur des syllabes qui, refermées sur eux, les laissaient maintenant encadrer le porche de l’église persane et ne cesseraient plus de les contenir.","Maybe it was less too. Like a young man, on the day of an examination or a duel, finds the fact on which he was questioned, the bullet he fired, very little when he thinks of the reserves of science and courage he possesses and which he would have liked to show, likewise my spirit which had erected the Virgin of the Porch outside the reproductions which I had had before my eyes, inaccessible to the vicissitudes which could threaten them, intact if they were destroyed, ideal , having a universal value, was astonished to see the statue which he had sculpted a thousand times reduced now to its own appearance of stone, occupying in relation to the reach of my arm a place where it had for rivals an electoral poster and the point of my cane, chained to the Place, inseparable from the outlet of the main street, unable to escape the gaze of the cafe and the omnibus office, receiving on his face half the ray of the setting sun – and soon, in a few hours, from the light of the street lamp – including the office of the Co mptoir d'Escompte received the other half, earned, at the same time as this branch of a credit establishment, by the smell of the pastry chef's kitchens, subject to the tyranny of the Individual to the point that, if I had wanted to trace my signature on this stone, it is she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the only one (which, alas! meant the only one), who, on her body soiled with the same soot as the neighboring houses, would have, without being able to get rid of it, shown to all the admirers who came there to contemplate her the trace of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name, and it was her at last, the immortal and so long desired work of art, which I found, metamorphosed like the church itself, into a little old stone whose height and height I could measure. count the wrinkles. Time passed, I had to go back to the station where I had to wait for my grandmother and Françoise to go to Balbec-Plage together. I remembered what I had read about Balbec, Swann's words: ""It's delicious, it's as beautiful as Sienna."" And blaming my disappointment only on contingencies, the bad disposition I was in, my fatigue, my inability to know how to look, I tried to console myself by thinking that there were still other cities left untouched for me, that I might soon be able to penetrate, as if in the middle of a rain of pearls, into the cool twittering of the drippings of Quimperlé, cross the greenish and rosy reflection that bathed Pont-Aven; but for Balbec, as soon as I had entered it, it had been as if I had half-opened a name that had to be kept hermetically sealed and where, taking advantage of the outlet that I had imprudently offered them by chasing all the images that lived there up to then, a tram, a café, people passing through the square, the branch of the Comptoir d'Escompte, irresistibly pushed by an external pressure and a pneumatic force, had rushed into the interior of the syllables which, closed in on them, now let them frame the porch of the Persian church and would no longer cease to contain them.","It was something less, perhaps, also. As a young man on the day of an examination or of a duel feels the question that he has been asked, the shot that he has fired, to be a very little thing when he thinks of the reserves of knowledge and of valour that he possesses and would like to have displayed, so my mind, which had exalted the Virgin of the Porch far above the reproductions that I had had before my eyes, inaccessible by the vicissitudes which had power to threaten them, intact although they were destroyed, ideal, endowed with universal value, was astonished to see the statue which it had carved a thousand times, reduced now to its own apparent form in stone, occupying, on the radius of my outstretched arm, a place in which it had for rivals an election placard and the point of my stick, fettered to the Square, inseparable from the head of the main street, powerless to hide from the gaze of the Café and of the omnibus office, receiving on its face half of that ray of the setting sun (half, presently, in a few hours' time, of the light of the street lamp) of which the Bank building received the other half, tainted simultaneously with that branch office of a money–lending establishment by the smells from the pastry–cook's oven, subjected to the tyranny of the Individual to such a point that, if I had chosen to scribble my name upon that stone, it was she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the unique (which meant, alas, the only one) who, on her body coated with the same soot as defiled the neighbouring houses, would have displayed—powerless to rid herself of them—to all the admiring strangers come there to gaze upon her, the marks of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name; it was she, indeed, the immortal work of art, so long desired, whom I found, transformed, as was the church itself, into a little old woman in stone whose height I could measure and count her wrinkles. But time was passing; I must return to the station, where I was to wait for my grandmother and Françoise, so that we should all arrive at Balbec– Plage together. I reminded myself of what I had read about Balbec, of Swann's saying: ""It is exquisite; as fine as Siena."" And casting the blame for my disappointment upon various accidental causes, such as the state of my health, my exhaustion after the journey, my incapacity for looking at things properly, I endeavoured to console myself with the thought that other towns remained still intact for me, that I might soon, perhaps, be making my way, as into a shower of pearls, into the cool pattering sound that dripped from Quimperlé, cross that green water lit by a rosy glow in which Pont–Aven was bathed; but as for Balbec, no sooner had I set foot in it than it was as though I had broken open a name which ought to have been kept hermetically closed, and into which, seizing at once the opportunity that I had imprudently given them when I expelled all the images that had been living in it until then, a tramway, a Café, people crossing the square, the local branch of a Bank, irresistibly propelled by some external pressure, by a pneumatic force, had come crowding into the interior of those two syllables which, closing over them, let them now serve as a border to the porch of the Persian church, and would never henceforward cease to contain them.","It was also much less, perhaps. Just as a young man, having sat an examination or fought a duel, sees the answers he gave to the questions, or the bullet he fired, as paltry achievements compared to the great potential of learning or courage which he would have liked to display, so my mind, which had rescued the Virgin of the porch from the reproductions I had seen, protecting her for ever from any vicissitudes which might jeopardize them, letting her stand unscathed amid their annihilation, ideal, full of her universal value, was now amazed to see that the statue it had so often sculpted was reduced to nothing but its own shape in stone, cheek by jowl with an election notice, no less reachable than it, no less touchable with the tip of my cane, rooted to the square, inseparable from the junction with the high street, incapable of hiding from any eyes looking out from the café or the horse-tram depot, her face sharing half of the rays of the setting sun – and soon, in a few hours, half of those of the street-lamp – with the local branch of the Savings Bank, and assailed, also like it, by the smells from the pastrycook’s kitchens, subjected so utterly to the tyranny of the Particular that, if I had felt like writing my name on the stone, it would have been this fabled Virgin, she whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an inaccessible beauty, the unique (which meant, alas, the only) Virgin of Balbec, who would have been unable to avoid showing to all admirers who came to gaze upon her the mark of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name scrawled on her body, which was stained with the same soot as the neighbouring houses, she whom, like the church itself, I now found transformed from the immortal work of art that I had longed to see into a little old woman in stone, whose height I could measure and whose wrinkles I could count. Time was getting on; I had to make my way back to the station from where, having met my grandmother and Françoise, I was to travel on to Balbec-Plage. I kept remembering everything I had ever read about Balbec and the words Swann had spoken: ‘It’s a delight – every bit as fine as Siena.’ Blaming my disappointment on mere contingencies, my unready mood, the fact that I was tired, my inability to look at things properly, I tried to draw consolation from the knowledge that, intact and unvisited, other towns awaited me else where, that I might soon be able to walk about Quimperlé, amid a shower of pearls and a cool murmuring of constant droplets, or step through the greenish pink glow surrounding Pont-Aven. But with Balbec it felt as though, by going there, I had broken open a name which should have been kept hermetically sealed, and into which, through the breach which I had been ill-advised enough to make, replacing all the images I had allowed to escape from it, a horse-tram, a café, people crossing the square, a branch of the Savings Bank, under the irresistible forces of external pressure and air suction, had rushed into the vacuum left in the syllables, which had now closed upon them, turning them into a frame for the porch of my Persian church, and would never again be rid of them."
"D’habitude, après avoir sorti de derrière les fagots pour un camarade de marque les histoires sur sir Rufus Israël et autres, M. Bloch sentant qu’il avait touché son fils jusqu’à l’attendrissement, se retirait pour ne pas se « galvauder » aux yeux du « potache ». Cependant s’il y avait une raison tout à fait capitale, comme quand son fils par exemple fut reçu à l’agrégation, M. Bloch ajouta à la série habituelle des anecdotes cette réflexion ironique qu’il réservait plutôt pour ses amis personnels et que Bloch jeune fut extrêmement fier de voir débiter pour ses amis à lui : « Le gouvernement a été impardonnable. Il n’a pas consulté M. Coquelin ! M. Coquelin a fait savoir qu’il était mécontent. » (M. Bloch se piquait d’être réactionnaire et méprisant pour les gens de théâtre).","Usually, after having brought out from behind the bundles for a distinguished comrade the stories about Sir Rufus Israel and others, Mr. Bloch, feeling that he had touched his son to the point of tenderness, withdrew so as not to tarnish"" in the eyes of the ""schoolboy"". However, if there was a very capital reason, as when his son, for example, was received at the Agrégation, Mr. Bloch added to the usual series of anecdotes this ironic reflection which he reserved rather for his personal friends and that Young Bloch was extremely proud to see his friends say: “The government has been unforgivable. He did not consult M. Coquelin! Mr. Coquelin made it known that he was unhappy. (Mr. Bloch prided himself on being reactionary and contemptuous of theater people).","As a rule, after bringing out from his store for the entertainment of a distinguished guest his anecdotes of Sir Rufus Israels and others, M. Bloch, feeling that he had succeeded in touching and melting his son's heart, would withdraw, so as not to spoil his effect in the eyes of the 'big pot.' If, however, there was an absolutely compelling reason, as for instance on the night when his son won his fellowship, M. Bloch would add to the usual string of anecdotes the following ironical reflexion which he ordinarily reserved for his own personal friends, so that young Bloch was extremely proud to see it produced for his: ""The Government have acted unpardonably. They have forgotten to consult M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known that he is displeased."" (M. Bloch prided himself on being a reactionary, with a contempt for theatrical people.)","Usually, once M. Bloch senior, so as to impress one of his son’s important friends, had brought out his choicest stories about Sir Rufus Israel, he would withdraw, feeling that he had already touched a chord of deepest gratitude in his son, and not wanting to ‘go too far’ in front of ‘the lad’. But if there was some quite exceptional reason, such as the time when ‘the lad’ passed the agrégation,77 then M. Bloch would augment the normal series of anecdotes by bringing out an ironic remark which he generally preferred to keep for his select group of friends, and which, now that it was offered to friends of the younger Bloch, filled the latter with an excess of pride: ‘The government’s behaviour is an outrage! They have not sought the view of M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known he is extremely upset.’ (M. Bloch took pride in being reactionary and scornful towards theatre people.)"
"Mes rêves se retrouvaient libres maintenant de se reporter sur telle ou telle des amies d’Albertine et d’abord sur Andrée, dont les gentillesses m’eussent peut-être moins touché si je n’avais été certain qu’elles seraient connues d’Albertine. Certes la préférence que depuis longtemps j’avais feinte pour Andrée m’avait fourni – en habitudes de causeries, de déclarations de tendresse – comme la matière d’un amour tout prêt pour elle, auquel il n’avait jusqu’ici manqué qu’un sentiment sincère qui s’y ajoutât et que maintenant mon cœur redevenu libre aurait pu fournir. Mais pour que j’aimasse vraiment Andrée, elle était trop intellectuelle, trop nerveuse, trop maladive, trop semblable à moi. Si Albertine me semblait maintenant vide, Andrée était remplie de quelque chose que je connaissais trop. J’avais cru le premier jour voir sur la plage une maîtresse de coureur, enivrée de l’amour des sports, et Andrée me disait que si elle s’était mise à en faire, c’était sur l’ordre de son médecin pour soigner sa neurasthénie et ses troubles de nutrition, mais que ses meilleures heures étaient celles où elle traduisait un roman de George Eliot. Ma déception, suite d’une erreur initiale sur ce qu’était Andrée, n’eut, en fait, aucune importance pour moi. Mais l’erreur était du genre de celles qui, si elles permettent à l’amour de naître et ne sont reconnues pour des erreurs que lorsqu’il n’est plus modifiable, deviennent une cause de souffrances. Ces erreurs – qui peuvent être différentes de celle que je commis pour Andrée et même inverses – tiennent souvent, dans le cas d’Andrée en particulier, à ce qu’on prend suffisamment l’aspect, les façons de ce qu’on n’est pas mais qu’on voudrait être, pour faire illusion au premier abord. À l’apparence extérieure, l’affectation, l’imitation, le désir d’être admiré, soit des bons, soit des méchants, ajoutent les faux semblants des paroles, des gestes. Il y a des cynismes, des cruautés qui ne résistent pas plus à l’épreuve que certaines bontés, certaines générosités. De même qu’on découvre souvent un avare vaniteux dans un homme connu pour ses charités, sa forfanterie de vice nous fait supposer une Messaline dans une honnête fille pleine de préjugés. J’avais cru trouver en Andrée une créature saine et primitive, alors qu’elle n’était qu’un être cherchant la santé, comme étaient peut-être beaucoup de ceux en qui elle avait cru la trouver et qui n’en avaient pas plus la réalité qu’un gros arthritique à figure rouge et en veste de flanelle blanche n’est forcément un Hercule. Or, il est telles circonstances où il n’est pas indifférent pour le bonheur que la personne qu’on a aimée pour ce qu’elle paraissait avoir de sain ne fût en réalité qu’une de ces malades qui ne reçoivent leur santé que d’autres, comme les planètes empruntent leur lumière, comme certains corps ne font que laisser passer l’électricité.","My dreams now found themselves free to relate to such and such of Albertine's friends and first of all to Andrée, whose kindnesses would perhaps have touched me less if I had not been certain that they would be known to Albertine. Certainly the preference that I had long feigned for Andrée had provided me – in habits of conversation, of declarations of tenderness – like the material for a ready-made love for her, which until now had only been lacking. a sincere feeling which was added to it and which now my heart, freed again, could have furnished. But for me to really love Andrée, she was too intellectual, too nervous, too sickly, too like me. If Albertine now seemed empty to me, Andrée was filled with something I knew too well. On the first day I had thought I saw a runner's mistress on the beach, intoxicated with the love of sports, and Andrée told me that if she had started to do it, it was on the orders of her doctor to treating her neurasthenia and her nutritional disorders, but that her best hours were when she was translating a novel by George Eliot. My disappointment, following an initial mistake about who Andrée was, was, in fact, of no importance to me. But the error was of the kind which, if it allows love to be born and is not recognized as error until it is no longer modifiable, becomes a cause of suffering. These errors – which may be different from the one I made for Andrée and even the opposite – often stem, in the case of Andrée in particular, from the fact that we sufficiently take on the aspect, the ways of what we do not is not but that one would like to be, to create an illusion at first sight. To the external appearance, affectation, imitation, the desire to be admired, either by the good or the bad, add the false pretenses of words, gestures. There are cynicisms, cruelties that do not stand the test any more than certain kindnesses, certain generosities. Just as one often discovers a vain miser in a man known for his charities, his braggadocio of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina in an honest girl full of prejudices. I thought I had found in Andrée a healthy and primitive creature, when she was only a being seeking health, as were perhaps many of those in whom she had thought to find it and who had none. no longer the reality that a fat, arthritic man with a red face and a white flannel jacket is not necessarily a Hercules. Now, there are such circumstances in which it is not indifferent for happiness that the person whom one has loved for what he appeared to be healthy was in reality only one of those sick people who only receive their health from ' others, like the planets borrow their light, like certain bodies only allow electricity to pass.","My dreams were now once more at liberty to concentrate on one or another of Albertine's friends, and returned first of all to Andrée, whose kindnesses might perhaps have appealed to me less strongly had I not been certain that they would come to Albertine's ears. Undoubtedly the preference that I had long been pretending to feel for Andrée had furnished me—in the habit of conversation with her, of declaring my affection—with, so to speak, the material, prepared and ready, for a love of her which had hitherto lacked only the complement of a genuine sentiment, and this my heart being once more free was now in a position to supply. But for me really to love Andrée, she was too intellectual, too neurotic, too sickly, too much like myself. If Albertine now seemed to me to be void of substance, Andrée was filled with something which I knew only too well. I had thought, that first day, that what I saw on the beach there was the mistress of some racing cyclist, passionately athletic; and now Andrée told me that if she had taken up athletic pastimes, it was under orders from her doctor, to cure her neurasthenia, her digestive troubles, but that her happiest hours were those which she spent in translating one of George Eliot's novels. The misunderstanding, due to an initial mistake as to what Andrée was, had not, as a matter of fact, the slightest importance. But my mistake was one of the kind which, if they allow love to be born, and are not recognised as mistakes until it has ceased to be under control, become a cause of suffering. Such mistakes—which may be quite different from mine with regard to Andrée, and even its exact opposite,—are frequently due (and this was especially the case here) to our paying too much attention to the aspect, the manners of what a person is not but would like to be, in forming our first impression of that person. To the outward appearance affectation, imitation, the longing to be admired, whether by the good or by the wicked, add misleading similarities of speech and gesture. These are cynicisms and cruelties which, when put to the test, prove no more genuine than certain apparent virtues and generosities. Just as we often discover a vain miser beneath the cloak of a man famed for his bountiful charity, so her flaunting of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina a respectable girl with middle–class prejudices. I had thought to find in Andrée a healthy, primitive creature, whereas she was merely a person in search of health, as were doubtless many of those in whom she herself had thought to find it, and who were in reality no more healthy than a burly arthritic with a red face and in white flannels is necessarily a Hercules. Now there are circumstances in which it is not immaterial to our happiness that the person whom we have loved because of what appeared to be so healthy about her is in reality only one of those invalids who receive such health as they possess from others, as the planets borrow their light, as certain bodies are only conductors of electricity.","My dreams were now free to recruit one or other of Albertine’s friends, first and foremost Andrée, whose attentions to me might not have endeared her so much to me, had I not known that Albertine would be bound to be told of it. My feigned fondness for Andrée had already given me, in the form of our cosy chats and murmured confidences, a sort of outer semblance of love for her, which lacked only the sincerity of a feeling that my heart, in its new state of availability, could now have afforded. However, it was impossible for any love of mine for Andrée to be true: she was too intellectual, too highly strung, too prone to ailment, too much like myself. Though Albertine now seemed empty, Andrée was full of something with which I was over-familiar. At my first sight of her on the beach, I had supposed she was a racing cyclist’s girlfriend, infatuated with the sporting life; yet Andrée now told me that, though she had taken an interest in sports, it was only on the advice of her doctor, who recommended it as a way of treating her neurasthenia and her eating difficulties, and that she was actually never happier than when translating into French a novel by George Eliot. This disappointment, the outcome of my own misconception about her, was actually of no consequence for me. But it was a misconception of the kind which, though they may foster the onset of love, and may not be recognized as misconceptions until love is beyond containment, can also foster sorrow. Such misconceptions (including some which differ from mine about Andrée, or which may even be the opposite of it) can be abetted by the fact – and this was exactly Andrée’s case – that, in our desire to be seen as someone we are not, we take on enough of the appearance and the ways of that someone to create an illusion at first encounter. To that outward appearance, affectation, imitation and the desire to be admired, either by the righteous or the unrighteous, add the misleading effects of words and gesture. Many a figment of cynicism or cruelty does not stand the test of closer acquaintance, any more than some acts of apparent goodness or generosity. A man renowned as a champion of charity can turn out a self-conceited skinflint; by showing off as though shameless, a simple girl full of the primmest prejudices can seem a Messalina. I had taken Andrée for a healthy, uncouth creature, whereas she was only a person seeking health, like many people in whom she herself may have seen evidence of rude health, but who came no closer to it than an overweight arthritic with a red face and a white flannel blazer comes to being a Hercules. In certain circumstances, our happiness may be compromised by the discovery that someone in whom we loved an appearance of good health is really an invalid, in whom the good health is as second-hand, as borrowed, as the light shed on us from the planets, or the electricity that certain inert bodies can conduct."
"Depuis quelque temps, dans certaines familles, le nom des Champs-Élysées, si quelque visiteur le prononçait, était accueilli par les mères avec l’air malveillant qu’elles réservent à un médecin réputé auquel elles prétendent avoir vu faire trop de diagnostics erronés pour avoir encore confiance en lui ; on assurait que ce jardin ne réussissait pas aux enfants, qu’on pouvait citer plus d’un mal de gorge, plus d’une rougeole et nombre de fièvres dont il était responsable. Sans mettre ouvertement en doute la tendresse de maman qui continuait à m’y envoyer, certaines de ses amies déploraient du moins son aveuglement.","For some time, in certain families, the name of the Champs-Élysées, if any visitor pronounced it, was greeted by mothers with the malevolent air which they reserve for a reputable doctor whom they claim to have seen made too many erroneous diagnoses to still have confidence in him; it was assured that this garden did not succeed with children, that one could cite more than one sore throat, more than one measles and a number of fevers for which it was responsible. Without openly questioning the tenderness of Mama who continued to send me there, some of her friends at least deplored her blindness.","For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs–Elysées, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have (or so they make out) seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight.","For some time, if a visitor chanced to mention the gardens of the Champs-Élysées in certain family circles, the name had been greeted by the mothers with the jaundiced look with which they might deprecate a mention of a highly regarded doctor who they claim has made too many mistakes of diagnosis for them to place any trust in him – these gardens, it was said, were not good for children, and were responsible for too many cases of sore throats, measles and different sorts of fevers. When my mother did not forbid my visits to the Champs-Élysées, some of her friends, though not openly questioning her love for me, did at least doubt her wisdom."
"Je continuais à attendre, seul, ou avec Swann et souvent Gilberte, qui était venue nous tenir compagnie. L’arrivée de Mme Swann, préparée par tant de majestueuses entrées, me paraissait devoir être quelque chose d’immense. J’épiais chaque craquement. Mais on ne trouve jamais aussi hauts qu’on les avait espérés une cathédrale, une vague dans la tempête, le bond d’un danseur ; après ces valets de pied en livrée, pareils aux figurants dont le cortège, au théâtre, prépare, et par là même diminue l’apparition finale de la reine, Mme Swann entrant furtivement en petit paletot de loutre, sa voilette baissée sur un nez rougi par le froid, ne tenait pas les promesses prodiguées dans l’attente à mon imagination.","I continued to wait, alone or with Swann and often Gilberte, who had come to keep us company. Madame Swann's arrival, prepared by so many majestic entrees, seemed to me to be something immense. I watched every creak. But one never finds a cathedral as high as one had hoped, a wave in a storm, the leap of a dancer; after these footmen in livery, like the extras whose procession, at the theater, prepares and thereby diminishes the final appearance of the Queen, Madame Swann entering furtively in a little otter overcoat, her veil lowered over a reddened nose by the cold, did not keep the promises lavished in expectation on my imagination.","I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must (so it seemed to me) be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer's leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter–skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink–tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination.","I sat waiting, either alone or with Swann, but often with Gilberte, who came in to sit with us. I was sure that the arrival of Mme Swann, foreshadowed by so many majestic entrances, would have to be a stupendous event. I expected it at each creak of a floorboard. But our expectations are always higher than the tallest cathedral, the mightiest wave in a storm, the highest leap of a dancer; and after all these liveried footmen, whose comings and goings were like those of extras on the stage preparing the climactic coming of the Queen, but thereby making it something of an anticlimax, when Mme Swann did slip in, wearing her short otter-skin coat, her veil lowered over her nose which glowed from the cold outside, she broke all the promises that the wait had made to my imagination."
"M. de Norpois leva les yeux au ciel d’un air de dire : Ah ! celui-là ! « D’abord, c’est un acte d’ingratitude. C’est plus qu’un crime, c’est une faute et d’une sottise que je qualifierai de pyramidale ! Au reste si personne n’y met le hola, l’homme qui a chassé Bismarck est bien capable de répudier peu à peu toute la politique bismarckienne, alors c’est le saut dans l’inconnu. »","M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven with an air of saying: Ah! that one ! “First, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime, it is a fault and a stupidity that I will describe as pyramidal! Moreover, if no one puts a hola to it, the man who chased Bismarck is quite capable of gradually repudiating all of Bismarck's politics, so it's a leap into the unknown. »","M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, ""Oh, that fellow!"" before he replied: ""In the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.""","As much as to say, ‘That man!’ M. de Norpois cast his eyes heavenwards: ‘For one thing, it was an act of arrant ingratitude. It was worse than a crime – it was a mistake!9 And as for the stupidity of it, the only word for that is monumental. For another thing, if someone doesn’t put a stop to it, the man who gave Bismarck his marching orders is quite capable of repudiating each and every one of Bismarck’s policies."
"– Mais oui, naturellement, c’est Palamède de Guermantes.","– Yes, of course, it is Palamède de Guermantes.","""Of course he is; Palamède de Guermantes.""",– But of course – he’s Palamède de Guermantes.
"Je dus me taire et regarder tout à fait par la fenêtre. Ma grand’mère sortit un instant de la chambre. Mais le lendemain je me mis à parler de philosophie sur le ton le plus indifférent, en m’arrangeant cependant pour que ma grand’mère fît attention à mes paroles ; je dis que c’était curieux qu’après les dernières découvertes de la science le matérialisme semblait ruiné, et que le plus probable était encore l’éternité des âmes et leur future réunion.","I had to shut up and stare out the window altogether. My grandmother left the room for a moment. But the next day I began to talk of philosophy in the most indifferent tone, managing, however, to make my grandmother pay attention to my words; I say that it was curious that after the latest discoveries of science materialism seemed ruined, and that the most probable was still the eternity of souls and their future reunion.","I was obliged to stop, and looked straight out of the window. My grandmother went out of the room for something. But next day I began to talk to her about philosophy, and, speaking in a tone of complete indifference, but at the same time taking care that my grandmother should pay attention to what I was saying, I remarked what a curious thing it was that, according to the latest scientific discoveries, the materialist position appeared to be crumbling, and the most likely thing to be, once again, the survival of the soul and reunion in a life everlasting.","I had to stop talking and gaze right out of the window. My grandmother left the room for a moment. Then the following evening I launched into philosophy, speaking in a detached voice but making sure that she was paying attention to my words: it was remarkable, I said, that the latest advances in science seemed to have made materialism untenable, and that the most likely outcome was still the eternal life of the soul and reunion beyond the grave."
"J’entendais le grondement de mes nerfs dans lesquels il y avait du bien-être indépendant des objets extérieurs qui peuvent en donner et que le moindre déplacement que j’occasionnais à mon corps, à mon attention, suffisait à me faire éprouver, comme à un œil fermé une légère compression donne la sensation de la couleur. J’avais déjà bu beaucoup de porto, et si je demandais à en prendre encore, c’était moins en vue du bien-être que les verres nouveaux m’apporteraient que par l’effet du bien-être produit par les verres précédents. Je laissais la musique conduire elle-même mon plaisir sur chaque note où, docilement, il venait alors se poser. Si, pareil à ces industries chimiques grâce auxquelles sont débités en grandes quantités des corps qui ne se rencontrent dans la nature que d’une façon accidentelle et fort rarement, ce restaurant de Rivebelle réunissait en un même moment plus de femmes au fond desquelles me sollicitaient des perspectives de bonheur que le hasard des promenades ne m’en eût fait rencontrer en une année ; d’autre part, cette musique que nous entendions – arrangements de valses, d’opérettes allemandes, de chansons de cafés-concerts, toutes nouvelles pour moi – était elle-même comme un lieu de plaisir aérien superposé à l’autre et plus grisant que lui. Car chaque motif, particulier comme une femme, ne réservait pas comme elle eût fait, pour quelque privilégié, le secret de volupté qu’il recélait : il me le proposait, me reluquait, venait à moi d’une allure capricieuse ou canaille, m’accostait, me caressait, comme si j’étais devenu tout d’un coup plus séduisant, plus puissant ou plus riche ; je leur trouvais bien, à ces airs, quelque chose de cruel ; c’est que tout sentiment désintéressé de la beauté, tout reflet de l’intelligence leur étaient inconnus ; pour eux le plaisir physique existe seul. Et ils sont l’enfer le plus impitoyable, le plus dépourvu d’issues pour le malheureux jaloux à qui ils présentent ce plaisir – ce plaisir que la femme aimée goûte avec un autre – comme la seule chose qui existe au monde pour celle qui le remplit tout entier. Mais tandis que je répétais à mi-voix les notes de cet air, et lui rendais son baiser, la volupté à lui spéciale qu’il me faisait éprouver me devint si chère, que j’aurais quitté mes parents pour suivre le motif dans le monde singulier qu’il construisait dans l’invisible, en lignes tour à tour pleines de langueur et de vivacité. Quoiqu’un tel plaisir ne soit pas d’une sorte qui donne plus de valeur à l’être auquel il s’ajoute, car il n’est perçu que de lui seul, et quoique, chaque fois que dans notre vie nous avons déplu à une femme qui nous a aperçu, elle ignorât si à ce moment-là nous possédions ou non cette félicité intérieure et subjective qui, par conséquent, n’eût rien changé au jugement qu’elle porta sur nous, je me sentais plus puissant, presque irrésistible. Il me semblait que mon amour n’était plus quelque chose de déplaisant et dont on pouvait sourire, mais avait précisément la beauté touchante, la séduction de cette musique, semblable elle-même à un milieu sympathique où celle que j’aimais et moi nous nous serions rencontrés, soudain devenus intimes.","I heard the rumbling of my nerves in which there was well-being independent of the external objects which can give it and that the slightest displacement that I caused to my body, to my attention, was enough to make me feel, as if one eye closed a slight squeeze gives the sensation of color. I had already drunk a lot of port, and if I asked to take more, it was less for the well-being that the new glasses would bring me than for the effect of the well-being produced by the previous glasses. I let the music drive my pleasure itself on each note where, obediently, it then came to rest. If, similar to those chemical industries thanks to which large quantities of bodies are debited which only occur accidentally and very rarely in nature, this restaurant in Rivebelle brought together at the same time more women whose bottoms appealed to me prospects of happiness which chance walks would not have given me in a year; on the other hand, this music that we heard – arrangements of waltzes, German operettas, café-concert songs, all new to me – was itself like a place of aerial pleasure superimposed on the other and more exhilarating than him. For each motive, as particular as a woman, did not reserve as she would have done, for some privileged person, the secret of pleasure it concealed: accosted, caressed me, as if I had suddenly become more attractive, more powerful or richer; I found in them, in these airs, something cruel; it is that any disinterested feeling of beauty, any reflection of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasure exists alone. And they are the most pitiless hell, the most devoid of exits for the jealous unfortunate to whom they present this pleasure - this pleasure that the beloved woman tastes with another - as the only thing that exists in the world for the one who loves it. completely fills. But while I repeated the notes of this air in a low voice, and returned his kiss, the special pleasure he made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my parents to follow the motif in the world. singular world that he built in the invisible, in lines alternately full of languor and liveliness. Although such pleasure is not of a kind which gives more value to the being to which it is added, for it is perceived only by itself, and although, each time in our life we have displeased to a woman who saw us, she did not know whether or not at that moment we possessed this inner and subjective bliss which, consequently, would not have changed the judgment she passed on us, I felt more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unpleasant and something to smile about, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seduction of this music, itself similar to a sympathetic environment where the one I loved and I we would have met, suddenly become intimate.","I could hear the twinging of my nerves, in which there was a sense of comfort independent of the external objects that might have produced it, a comfort which the least shifting of my body or of my attention was enough to make me feel, just as to a shut eye a slight pressure gives the sensation of colour. I had already drunk a good deal of port wine, and if I now asked for more it was not so much with a view to the comfort which the additional glasses would bring me as an effect of the comfort produced by the glasses that had gone before. I allowed the music itself to guide to each of its notes my pleasure which, meekly following, rested on each in turn. If, like one of those chemical industries by means of which are prepared in large quantities bodies which in a state of nature come together only by accident and very rarely, this restaurant at Rivebelle united at one and the same moment more women to tempt me with beckoning vistas of happiness than the hazard of walks and drives would have made me encounter in a year; on the other hand, this music that greeted our ears,—arrangements of waltzes, of German operettas, of music–hall songs, all of them quite new to me—was itself like an ethereal resort of pleasure superimposed upon the other and more intoxicating still. For these tunes, each as individual as a woman, were not keeping, as she would have kept, for some privileged person, the voluptuous secret which they contained: they offered me their secrets, ogled me, came up to me with affected or vulgar movements, accosted me , caressed me as if I had suddenly become more seductive, more powerful and more rich; I indeed found in these tunes an element of cruelty; because any such thing as a disinterested feeling for beauty, a gleam of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasures alone existed. And they are the most merciless of hells, the most gateless and imprisoning for the jealous wretch to whom they present that pleasure—that pleasure which the woman he loves is enjoying with another—as the only thing that exists in the world for her who is all the world to him. But while I was humming softly to myself the notes of this tune, and returning its kiss, the pleasure peculiar to itself which it made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my father and mother, to follow it through the singular world which it constructed in the invisible, in lines instinct with alternate languor and vivacity. Although such a pleasure as this is not calculated to enhance the value of the person to whom it comes, for it is perceived by him alone, and although whenever, in the course of our life, we have failed to attract a woman who has caught sight of us, she could not tell whether at that moment we possessed this inward and subjective felicity which, consequently, could in no way have altered the judgment that she passed on us , I felt myself more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unattractive, at which people might smile, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seductiveness of this music, itself comparable to a friendly atmosphere in which she whom I loved and I were to meet, suddenly grown intimate.","I could hear the muffled protests of my nerves, in which there was actually a feeling of well-being, unconnected with the external objects which can supply it, but which the slightest movement I made with my body or my mind sufficed to give to me, as a gentle pressure on a closed eye can create an impression of colour. I had already drunk a great deal of port; and when I asked for more, it was less because I was hoping the next glasses would give a feeling of well-being than because the previous ones had already given it. I let the music conduct my pleasure to each note, and it rested on them docilely. While the restaurant at Rivebelle, like those chemical industries which produce great quantities of substances which, in nature, occur only by chance and are very rare, brought together more women and their prospects of happiness for me than a year of chance encounters during journeys or outings in the country could have brought me, the music we could hear (arrangements of waltzes, German operettas and cabaret songs, all of it new to me) was itself like an airy place of pleasure, superimposed on the real one and more exciting than it: each musical phrase, though as individual as a particular woman, did not limit to a single privileged person, as she would have done, the secret of its sensual thrills – it offered them to me, it ogled me, it accosted me, it toyed with me in seductively whimsical or vulgar ways, it caressed me, as though I had suddenly become more attractive, more powerful or wealthy; and in the tunes I detected something cruel: the fact that the slightest disinterested sense of beauty or vestige of intelligence was foreign to them – for them, there is nothing beyond physical pleasure. They are the most merciless form of hell, the hell with no way out, for any poor victim of jealousy who hears that pleasure in them – the pleasure which the woman he loves enjoys with someone else – and who hears it as the only thing desired in the whole world by the woman who is the whole world to him. To me, as I hummed over the tune and returned its kiss, the special sensual pleasure which it gave enchanted me so much that I would have left my parents, to follow the echoes of the phrase through the singular world which it created in its invisible element, its outlines at times languishing, at times sprightly. At such moments, despite the fact that this secret joy is not of a sort which increases the attractiveness of the person who has acquired it, since no one else can perceive it, and though any failure to impress a woman who may have dismissed us at a single glance cannot possibly be imputed to our having or not having this inner and subjective bliss, since in her unawareness of its presence or absence in us, her view of us is bound to be unaffected by it, I felt endowed with a power which seemed to make me almost irresistible. It felt as though my love was no longer something irksome, something to be dismissed with a smile, but that it had exactly the touching beauty, the wistful charm of this music, which itself now gave the impression of being a favourable place and time which had brought me and the woman I loved together, to meet and become close."
"Il ne m’offrit absolument rien pour la Revue des Deux-Mondes, mais me posa un certain nombre de questions sur ce qu’avaient été ma vie et mes études, sur mes goûts dont j’entendis parler pour la première fois comme s’il pouvait être raisonnable de les suivre, tandis que j’avais cru jusqu’ici que c’était un devoir de les contrarier. Puisqu’ils me portaient du côté de la littérature, il ne me détourna pas d’elle ; il m’en parla au contraire avec déférence comme d’une personne vénérable et charmante du cercle choisi de laquelle, à Rome ou à Dresde, on a gardé le meilleur souvenir et qu’on regrette par suite des nécessités de la vie de retrouver si rarement. Il semblait m’envier en souriant d’un air presque grivois les bons moments que, plus heureux que lui et plus libre, elle me ferait passer. Mais les termes mêmes dont il se servait me montraient la Littérature comme trop différente de l’image que je m’en étais faite à Combray, et je compris que j’avais eu doublement raison de renoncer à elle. Jusqu’ici je m’étais seulement rendu compte que je n’avais pas le don d’écrire ; maintenant M. de Norpois m’en ôtait même le désir. Je voulus lui exprimer ce que j’avais rêvé ; tremblant d’émotion, je me serais fait un scrupule que toutes mes paroles ne fussent pas l’équivalent le plus sincère possible de ce que j’avais senti et que je n’avais jamais essayé de me formuler ; c’est dire que mes paroles n’eurent aucune netteté. Peut-être par habitude professionnelle, peut-être en vertu du calme qu’acquiert tout homme important dont on sollicite le conseil et qui, sachant qu’il gardera en mains la maîtrise de la conversation, laisse l’interlocuteur s’agiter, s’efforcer, peiner à son aise, peut-être aussi pour faire valoir le caractère de sa tête (selon lui grecque, malgré les grands favoris), M. de Norpois, pendant qu’on lui exposait quelque chose, gardait une immobilité de visage aussi absolue que si vous aviez parlé devant quelque buste antique – et sourd – dans une glyptothèque. Tout à coup, tombant comme le marteau du commissaire-priseur, ou comme un oracle de Delphes, la voix de l’Ambassadeur qui vous répondait vous impressionnait d’autant plus que rien dans sa face ne vous avait laissé soupçonner le genre d’impression que vous aviez produit sur lui, ni l’avis qu’il allait émettre.","He offered me absolutely nothing for the Revue des Deux-Mondes, but asked me a certain number of questions about my life and my studies, about my tastes, which I heard about for the first time as if it might be reasonable to follow them, whereas I had hitherto believed it was a duty to thwart them. Since they carried me on the side of literature, he did not turn me away from it; on the contrary, he spoke to me of him with deference as a venerable and charming person of the chosen circle of whom, in Rome or in Dresden, one has kept the best memory and whom one regrets as a result of the necessities of life to find again if rarely. He seemed to envy me, with an almost saucy smile, the good times that, happier than him and freer, she would give me. But the very terms he used showed me literature as too different from the image I had formed of it at Combray, and I realized that I had been doubly right to give it up. So far I had only realized that I did not have the gift of writing; now M. de Norpois deprived me of even the desire to do so. I wanted to tell him what I had dreamed; trembling with emotion, I would have had a qualm that all my words were not the most sincere possible equivalent of what I had felt and had never tried to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clarity. Perhaps out of professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm acquired by any important man whose advice is sought and who, knowing that he will keep control of the conversation in his hands, lets the interlocutor get agitated, striving, toiling at his ease, perhaps also to show off the character of his head (according to him Greek, in spite of the great favourites), M. de Norpois, while something was being explained to him, kept an immobility of face as absolute as if you had spoken in front of some ancient – and deaf – bust in a glyptothek. Suddenly, falling like the hammer of the auctioneer, or like an oracle of Delphi, the voice of the Ambassador who answered you impressed you all the more because nothing in his face had let you suspect the kind of impression that you had produced on him, nor the opinion that he was about to issue.","He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deux–Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one's multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the 'gift' for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasise the dignity of his head (Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers), M. de Norpois, while anything was being explained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer's hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador's voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to express.","However, he made me no promise of good offices with the Revue des Deux Mondes, although he did ask me certain questions on my past life and studies, as well as on the things I liked, this being the first time anybody had mentioned such things in a way which, rather than giving me the idea that it was my duty to resist them, suggested they might be perfectly respectable. Seeing that I was inclined towards literature, M. de Norpois, rather than try to put me off it, spoke of it with deference, as though it was a charming dowager whose select company one remembers well from having been admitted to it in Rome or Dresden, and whom one would be glad to see more of, were it not for the unavoidable impediments of life. More favoured and freer than himself, I could be sure of having a good time with her, or so a hint of envious naughtiness in his smile seemed to suggest. But the very words he used showed me that Literature was utterly different from the image I had had of it in Combray; and I realized how right I had been to abandon all notion of it. Until that moment, my only thought had been that I had no gift for writing; but M. de Norpois now freed me of the very urge to write. I tried to explain what my dreams had been; I was trembling with emotion, in my anxiety to find the most accurate words to express what I had felt but had never before tried to put into words; and that was why what I did say was so garbled. It may have been a professional habit with him, it may have been the acquired composure of any important man being asked for advice who, knowing that control of the conversation remains in his hands, lets you meander about and exhaust yourself looking for the best words, or it may have been so as to display at its best the style of his head, which he saw as Grecian notwithstanding his great muttonchop whiskers, but M. de Norpois, while you held forth, kept as straight a face as if you were haranguing an ancient (and stone deaf) bust in the Glyptothek at Munich or Copenhagen. Then, as conclusive as an auctioneer’s gavel or the Oracle at Delphi, his voice as he replied struck you with unexpected force, nothing in his expression having let you guess at the effect you had been making, or what view he would give."
"– Ma fille, dit ma grand’mère, je te vois comme Madame de Sévigné, une carte devant les yeux et ne nous quittant pas un instant.","“My daughter,” said my grandmother, “I see you like Madame de Sévigné, a card before my eyes and never leaving us for a moment.","""My dear,"" said my grandmother, ""I picture you like Mme. de Sévigné, your eyes glued to the map, and never losing sight of us for an instant.""","– My dear, said my grandmother, I can see you’ll be just like Mme de Sévigné, following our every movement on the map!’"
"J’allai voir Bloch à la suite de ce dîner, il me rendit ma visite, mais j’étais sorti et il fut aperçu, me demandant, par Françoise, laquelle par hasard bien qu’il fût venu à Combray ne l’avait jamais vu jusque-là. De sorte qu’elle savait seulement qu’un « des Monsieurs » que je connaissais était passé pour me voir, elle ignorait « à quel effet », vêtu d’une manière quelconque et qui ne lui avait pas fait grande impression. Or j’avais beau savoir que certaines idées sociales de Françoise me resteraient toujours impénétrables, qui reposaient peut-être en partie sur des confusions entre des mots, des noms qu’elle avait pris une fois, et à jamais, les uns pour les autres, je ne pus m’empêcher, moi qui avais depuis longtemps renoncé à me poser des questions dans ces cas-là, de chercher, vainement d’ailleurs, ce que le nom de Bloch pouvait représenter d’immense pour Françoise. Car à peine lui eus-je dit que ce jeune homme qu’elle avait aperçu était M. Bloch, elle recula de quelques pas, tant furent grandes sa stupeur et sa déception. « Comment, c’est cela, M. Bloch ! » s’écria-t-elle d’un air atterré comme si un personnage aussi prestigieux eût dû posséder une apparence qui « fît connaître » immédiatement qu’on se trouvait en présence d’un grand de la terre, et à la façon de quelqu’un qui trouve qu’un personnage historique n’est pas à la hauteur de sa réputation, elle répétait d’un ton impressionné, et où on sentait pour l’avenir les germes d’un scepticisme universel : « Comment, c’est ça M. Bloch ! Ah ! vraiment on ne dirait pas à le voir. » Elle avait l’air de m’en garder rancune comme si je lui eusse jamais « surfait » Bloch. Et pourtant elle eut la bonté d’ajouter : « Hé bien, tout M. Bloch qu’il est, Monsieur peut dire qu’il est aussi bien que lui. »","I went to see Bloch after that dinner, he paid me a visit, but I had gone out and he was seen asking me, by Françoise, who by chance, although he had come to Combray, had never seen her. seen so far. So that she only knew that one ""of the Gentlemen"" I knew had come to see me, she did not know ""to what effect"", dressed in some way and who had not made a big impression on her. However, I knew in vain that certain social ideas of Françoise would always remain impenetrable to me, which were perhaps partly based on confusions between words, names that she had taken once, and forever, for each other. , I could not prevent myself, I who had long since given up asking myself questions in such cases, to seek, in vain moreover, what the name of Bloch could represent of immense for Françoise. For no sooner had I told her that the young man she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled a few steps, so great was her astonishment and disappointment. “How, that’s it, M. Bloch! she exclaimed with an air of bewilderment, as if such a prestigious personage should have possessed an appearance which ""made it known"" immediately that we were in the presence of a great man of the earth, and in the manner of someone who finds that a historical personage is not up to his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, and in which one felt for the future the seeds of a universal skepticism: ""How, it is that Mr. Bloch! Ah! really one would not say to see it. She seemed to hold a grudge against me as if I had never ""overdone"" Bloch for her. And yet she had the kindness to add: “Well, Mr. Bloch though he is, Monsieur can say he is as good as he is. »","I called upon Bloch after this dinner; he returned my call, but I was out and he was seen asking for me by Françoise, who, as it happened, albeit he had visited us at Combray, had never set eyes on him until then. So that she knew only that one of 'the gentlemen' who were friends of mine had looked in to see me, she did not know 'with what object,' dressed in a nondescript way, which had not made any particular impression upon her. Now though I knew quite well that certain of Françoise's social ideas must for ever remain impenetrable by me, ideas based, perhaps, partly upon confusions between words, between names which she had once and for all time mistaken for one another, I could not restrain myself, who had long since abandoned the quest for enlightenment in such cases, from seeking—and seeking, moreover, in vain—to discover what could be the immense significance that the name of Bloch had for Françoise. For no sooner had I mentioned to her that the young man whom she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled several paces, so great were her stupor and disappointment. "" What! Is that M. Bloch?"" she cried, thunderstruck, as if so portentous a personage ought to have been endowed with an appearance which 'made you know' as soon as you saw him that you were in the presence of one of the great ones of the earth; and, like some one who has discovered that an historical character is not 'up to' the level of his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, in which I could detect latent, for future growth, the seeds of a universal scepticism: ""What! Is that M. Bloch? Well, really, you would never think it, to look at him. "" She seemed also to bear me a grudge, as if I had always 'overdone' the praise of Bloch to her. At the same time she was kind enough to add: ""Well, he may be M. Bloch, and all that. I'm sure Master can say he's every bit as good.""","I went to see Bloch shortly after this dinner, and when he came to the hotel to return my visit, I was out. As he was asking for me, he was noticed by Françoise, who as it happened, though he had once come to Combray, had never set eyes on him before. All she knew was that ‘one of my gents’ had called to see me, but she ‘didn’t know for why’; all she could say was that it was a man dressed in no particular style and who had made no great impression on her. Though I knew that some of Françoise’s notions about social things would remain for ever impenetrable to me, that they derived from misheard words, names once mistaken and never thereafter put right, and though I had long since taken the view that any investigation into this was pointless, I could not help wondering, to no avail, of course, what there could possibly be in the name ‘Bloch’ which she found so stupendous. For I had no sooner told her that the young man she had seen was M. Bloch, than she stepped back, dumbfounded and disappointed. ‘What! You mean that’s M. Bloch?’ she gasped, quite staggered, as though such a prestigious personage should have had an appearance which would make manifest to all and sundry that they were in the presence of a prodigy of nature; and like someone finding out that a historical figure does not live up to his reputation, she repeated in an awe-struck voice which suggested that in future she would be a sadder but wiser, if more sceptical, woman, ‘ So, that was M. Bloch! Well, all I can say is, you wouldn’t think so to see him!’ She seemed to bear me a grudge, as though I had misled her about him, or exaggerated his importance. She did, however, have the considerateness to add, ‘Well, if that’s your M. Bloch, sir, then all I can say is you’re every bit as good as he is!’"
"Comme toujours, mais plus facilement pendant que son père s’était éloigné pour causer avec le bâtonnier, je regardais Mlle de Stermaria. Autant que la singularité hardie et toujours belle de ses attitudes, comme quand, les deux coudes posés sur la table, elle élevait son verre au-dessus de ses deux avant-bras, la sécheresse d’un regard vite épuisé, la dureté foncière, familiale, qu’on sentait, mal recouverte sous ses inflexions personnelles, au fond de sa voix, et qui avait choqué ma grand’mère, une sorte de cran d’arrêt atavique auquel elle revenait dès que dans un coup d’œil ou une intonation elle avait achevé de donner sa pensée propre ; tout cela ramenait la pensée de celui qui la regardait vers la lignée qui lui avait légué cette insuffisance de sympathie humaine, des lacunes de sensibilité, un manque d’ampleur dans l’étoffe qui à tout moment faisait faute. Mais à certains regards qui passaient un instant sur le fond si vite à sec de sa prunelle et dans lesquels on sentait cette douceur presque humble que le goût prédominant des plaisirs des sens donne à la plus fière, laquelle bientôt ne reconnaît plus qu’un prestige, celui qu’a pour elle tout être qui peut les lui faire éprouver, fût-ce un comédien ou un saltimbanque pour lequel elle quittera peut-être un jour son mari ; à certaine teinte d’un rose sensuel et vif qui s’épanouissait dans ses joues pâles, pareille à celle qui mettait son incarnat au cœur des nymphéas blancs de la Vivonne, je croyais sentir qu’elle eût facilement permis que je vinsse chercher sur elle le goût de cette vie si poétique qu’elle menait en Bretagne, vie à laquelle, soit par trop d’habitude, soit par distinction innée, soit par dégoût de la pauvreté ou de l’avarice des siens, elle ne semblait pas trouver grand prix, mais que pourtant elle contenait enclose en son corps. Dans la chétive réserve de volonté qui lui avait été transmise et qui donnait à son expression quelque chose de lâche, peut-être n’eût-elle pas trouvé les ressources d’une résistance. Et surmonté d’une plume un peu démodée et prétentieuse, le feutre gris qu’elle portait invariablement à chaque repas me la rendait plus douce, non parce qu’il s’harmonisait avec son teint d’argent ou de rose, mais parce qu’en me la faisant supposer pauvre, il la rapprochait de moi. Obligée à une attitude de convention par la présence de son père, mais apportant déjà à la perception et au classement des êtres qui étaient devant elle des principes autres que lui, peut-être voyait-elle en moi non le rang insignifiant, mais le sexe et l’âge. Si un jour M. de Stermaria était sorti sans elle, surtout si Mme de Villeparisis en venant s’asseoir à notre table lui avait donné de nous une opinion qui m’eût enhardi à m’approcher d’elle, peut-être aurions-nous pu échanger quelques paroles, prendre un rendez-vous, nous lier davantage. Et, un mois où elle serait restée seule sans ses parents dans son château romanesque, peut-être aurions-nous pu nous promener seuls le soir tous deux dans le crépuscule où luiraient plus doucement au-dessus de l’eau assombrie les fleurs roses des bruyères, sous les chênes battus par le clapotement des vagues. Ensemble nous aurions parcouru cette île empreinte pour moi de tant de charme parce qu’elle avait enfermé la vie habituelle de Mlle de Stermaria et qu’elle reposait dans la mémoire de ses yeux. Car il me semblait que je ne l’aurais vraiment possédée que là, quand j’aurais traversé ces lieux qui l’enveloppaient de tant de souvenirs – voile que mon désir voulait arracher et de ceux que la nature interpose entre la femme et quelques êtres (dans la même intention qui lui fait, pour tous, mettre l’acte de la reproduction entre eux et le plus vif plaisir, et pour les insectes, placer devant le nectar le pollen qu’ils doivent emporter) afin que trompés par l’illusion de la posséder ainsi plus entière ils soient forcés de s’emparer d’abord des paysages au milieu desquels elle vit et qui, plus utiles pour leur imagination que le plaisir sensuel, n’eussent pas suffi pourtant, sans lui, à les attirer.","As always, but more easily while her father had gone away to chat with the President of the Bar, I looked at Mademoiselle de Stermaria. As much as the bold and always beautiful singularity of her postures, like when, with both elbows resting on the table, she raised her glass above her two forearms, the dryness of a look quickly exhausted, the fundamental hardness, family, which one felt, badly covered under her personal inflections, at the bottom of her voice, and which had shocked my grandmother, a kind of atavistic switchblade to which she returned as soon as in a glance or a intonation she had finished giving her own thought; all this brought back the thought of the one who looked at her towards the lineage which had bequeathed to her this insufficiency of human sympathy, gaps in sensitivity, a lack of breadth in the fabric which at all times was lacking. But in certain glances which passed for a moment over the quickly dry bottom of her pupil and in which one felt that almost humble sweetness that the predominant taste for the pleasures of the senses gives to the proudest, who soon only recognizes a prestige , the one that has for her any being who can make her experience them, be it an actor or a mountebank for whom she will perhaps one day leave her husband; in a certain shade of a sensual and lively pink that bloomed in her pale cheeks, like the one that put its pink in the heart of the white water lilies of the Vivonne, I thought I felt that she would have easily allowed me to come and seek on her the taste for this poetic life that she led in Brittany, a life in which, either by too much habit, or by innate distinction, or by disgust with the poverty or the avarice of her family, she did not seem to find great price, but which nevertheless it contained enclosed in its body. In the feeble reserve of will which had been transmitted to her and which gave her expression something cowardly, perhaps she would not have found the resources of a resistance. And topped with a somewhat old-fashioned, pretentious feather, the gray felt hat she invariably wore to every meal made her feel sweeter to me, not because it matched her silver or pink complexion, but because By making me suppose her poor, he brought her closer to me. Forced into an attitude of convention by the presence of her father, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the beings who were before her principles other than him, perhaps she saw in me not the insignificant rank, but the sex and age. If one day Monsieur de Stermaria had gone out without her, especially if Madame de Villeparisis, coming to sit down at our table, had given her an opinion of us which would have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps we would have we were able to exchange a few words, make an appointment, bind us more. And, one month when she would have remained alone without her parents in her romantic castle, perhaps we could have walked alone in the evening together in the twilight where the pink flowers of the heather, under the oaks battered by the lapping of the waves. Together we would have traveled this island imprinted for me with so much charm because it had locked up the usual life of Mlle de Stermaria and rested in the memory of her eyes. Because it seemed to me that I would have really possessed her only there, when I would have crossed these places which enveloped her in so many memories – a veil that my desire wanted to tear off and those that nature interposes between the woman and some beings. (with the same intention which makes him, for all, to put the act of reproduction between them and the liveliest pleasure, and for the insects, to place before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away) so that deceived by the illusion of possessing her thus more fully, they are forced to first seize the landscapes in the midst of which she lives and which, more useful for their imagination than sensual pleasure, would not have sufficed, without it, to attract them. .","Then as at all times, but more easily now that her father had left her and was talking to the barrister, I was gazing at Mlle. de Stermaria. No less than the bold and always graceful originality of her attitudes, as when, leaning her elbows on the table, she raised her glass in both hands over her outstretched arms, the dry flame of a glance at once extinguished, the ingrained, congenital hardness that one could feel, ill–concealed by her own personal inflexions, in the sound of her voice, which had shocked my grandmother; a sort of atavistic starting point to which she recoiled whenever, by glance or utterance, she had succeeded in expressing a thought of her own; all of these qualities carried the mind of him who watched her back to the line of ancestors who had bequeathed to her that inadequacy of human sympathy, those blanks in her sensibility, that short measure of humanity which was at every moment running out. But from a certain look which flooded for a moment the wells—instantly dry again—of her eyes, a look in which I could discern that almost obsequious docility which the predominance of a taste for sensual pleasures gives to the proudest of women, who will soon come to recognise but one form of personal distinction, that namely which any man enjoys who can make her feel those pleasures, an actor, an acrobat even, for whom, perhaps, she will one day leave her husband;—from a certain rosy tint, warm and sensual, which flushed her pallid cheeks, like the colour that stained the hearts of the white water–lilies in the Vivonne, I thought I could discern that she would readily have consented to my coming to seek in her the savour of that life of poetry and romance which she led in Brittany, a life to which, whether from over–familiarity or from innate superiority, or from disgust at the penury or the avarice of her family, she seemed not to attach any great value, but which, for all that, she held enclosed in her body. In the meagre stock of will–power that had been transmitted to her, and gave an element of weakness to her expression, she would not perhaps have found the strength to resist. And, crowned by a feather that was a trifle old–fashioned and pretentious, the grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meals made her all the more attractive to me, not because it was in harmony with her pearly or rosy complexion, but because, by making me suppose her to be poor, it brought her closer to myself. Obliged by her father's presence to adopt a conventional attitude, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the people who passed before her eyes other principles than his, perhaps she saw in me not my humble rank, but the right sex and age. If one day M. de Stermaria had gone out leaving her behind, if, above all, Mme. de Villeparisis, by coming to sit at our table, had given her an opinion of me which might have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps then we might have contrived to exchange a few words, to arrange a meeting, to form a closer tie. And for a whole month during which she would be left alone, without her parents, in her romantic Breton castle, we should perhaps have been able to wander by ourselves at evening, she and I together in the dusk which would shew in a softer light above the darkening water pink briar roses, beneath oak trees beaten and stunted by the hammering of the waves. Together we should have roamed that isle impregnated with so intense a charm for me because it had enclosed the everyday life of Mlle. de Stermaria and lay at rest in her remembering eyes. For it seemed to me that I should not really have possessed her save there, when I should have traversed those regions which enveloped her in so many memories—a veil which my desire sought to tear apart, one of those veils which nature interposes between woman and her pursuers (with the same intention as when, for all of us, she places the act of reproduction between ourselves and our keenest pleasure, and for insects, places before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away with them) in order that, tricked by the illusion of possessing her thus more completely, they may be forced to occupy first the scenes among which she lives, and which, of more service to their imagination than sensual pleasure can be, yet would not without that pleasure have had the power to attract them.","As usual, though more easily now that her father’s conversation with the bâtonnier had left her to her own devices, I sat and watched Mlle de Stermaria. One was struck not only by the eye-catching singularity and beauty of her every posture, as when she set both elbows on the table, her raised glass poised above her forearms, but also by the curt glance from an eye that let itself be only briefly caught, by a voice in which one sensed an underlying inbred hardness, barely masked by her individual inflections, which had irked my grandmother, as though Mlle de Stermaria had inherited some sort of pre-set ancestral mechanism which, after any expression of a private view, in a look or an intonation, automatically brought her back to neutral; and the observer’s mind was for ever drawn to the lineage which had handed down to her such a dearth of simple humanity, such deficiency in sensitivity, such meanness of spirit just below the surface. Yet, from certain soft gleams that flitted across her eye only to be quickly dulled, in which one could sense the almost humble docility that a penchant for the pleasures of the flesh gives to the haughtiest woman, who soon values only one thing in the world, and that thing is any man who affords her those pleasures, possibly just an actor or some paltry entertainer for whose sake one day she may even be prepared to leave her husband; and from a certain shade of sensual pink that bloomed on her pale cheeks, reminiscent of the blushes that glowed in the heart of the water-lilies on the Vivonne, I suspected she might not mind letting me be the one to taste on her person the poetic flavour of the life she led in Brittany, a life which, whether through a surfeit of habit, an innate distinction, or her displeasure at the poverty or avarice of her family, she seemed to find uninspiring, but which even so she contained within her body. From the meagre reserve of will-power which she had inherited, and which gave something craven to her expression, she might not have been able to summon up very vigorous resistance. The grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meal-times, with its pretentious and rather out-of-fashion plume, endeared her to me a little, not because it suited her complexion of pink and silver, but because, by letting me see her as impoverished, it brought her closer to my own level. It was just possible that, though constrained in the presence of her father to follow convention in the attitudes she adopted, but with principles different from his for the perceiving and classifying of other people, she saw in me not lowly rank but sex and youth. If only M. de Stermaria would go on an outing one day without her, and especially if Mme de Villeparisis had chosen that day to come and sit at our table and thus given Mlle de Stermaria an opinion of me which might make me bold enough to approach her, perhaps we might have been able to exchange a few words, arrange to meet, strike up an acquaintance. If her parents had left her to herself for a month in her romantic Breton château, we might have been able to wander alone in the gloaming, by the darkening waters, where the pinkish heather would have a softer glow under the oaks lashed by the leaping waves. Together we could ramble about her island fastness, which was steeped in so much charm for me because it had bounded the banal days of Mlle de Stermaria, and because the memory of it would haunt her eyes for ever. It felt as though I could never properly possess her anywhere else, as though I would have to trespass on the places which surrounded her with so many memories, as though these memories were a veil that my desire for her would have to strip away, one of those which is drawn between a woman and certain men by Nature (with the same purpose which makes it interpose the act of reproduction between all its creatures and their keenest pleasure, setting between the insect and the nectar it desires the pollen it must carry away) so that, misled by the illusion of possessing her more completely in that way, they feel compelled first to take possession of the landscapes among which she lives and which, though much more fruitful for the imagination than the sensual pleasure, would not have sufficed without it to attract them."
"Et pourtant cet appartement, parce qu’il avait été si passionnément désiré par la volonté de Swann, devait conserver pour lui quelque douceur, si j’en jugeais par moi pour qui il n’avait pas perdu tout mystère. Ce charme singulier dans lequel j’avais pendant si longtemps supposé que baignait la vie des Swann, je ne l’avais pas entièrement chassé de leur maison en y pénétrant ; je l’avais fait reculer, dompté qu’il était par cet étranger, ce paria que j’avais été et à qui Mlle Swann avançait maintenant gracieusement pour qu’il y prît place un fauteuil délicieux, hostile et scandalisé ; mais tout autour de moi, ce charme, dans mon souvenir, je le perçois encore. Est-ce parce que, ces jours où M. et Mme Swann m’invitaient à déjeuner, pour sortir ensuite avec eux et Gilberte, j’imprimais avec mon regard – pendant que j’attendais seul – sur le tapis, sur les bergères, sur les consoles, sur les paravents, sur les tableaux, l’idée gravée en moi que Mme Swann, ou son mari, ou Gilberte allaient entrer ? Est-ce parce que ces choses ont vécu depuis dans ma mémoire à côté des Swann et ont fini par prendre quelque chose d’eux ? Est-ce que, sachant qu’ils passaient leur existence au milieu d’elles, je faisais de toutes comme les emblèmes de leur vie particulière, de leurs habitudes dont j’avais été trop longtemps exclu pour qu’elles ne continuassent pas à me sembler étrangères même quand on me fit la faveur de m’y mêler ? Toujours est-il que chaque fois que je pense à ce salon que Swann (sans que cette critique impliquât de sa part l’intention de contrarier en rien les goûts de sa femme) trouvait si disparate – parce que tout conçu qu’il était encore dans le goût moitié serre, moitié atelier qui était celui de l’appartement où il avait connu Odette, elle avait pourtant commencé à remplacer dans ce fouillis nombre des objets chinois qu’elle trouvait maintenant un peu « toc », bien « à côté », par une foule de petits meubles tendus de vieilles soies Louis XIV (sans compter les chefs-d’œuvre apportés par Swann de l’hôtel du quai d’Orléans) – il a au contraire dans mon souvenir, ce salon composite, une cohésion, une unité, un charme individuel que n’ont jamais même les ensembles les plus intacts que le passé nous a légués, ni les plus vivants où se marque l’empreinte d’une personne ; car nous seuls pouvons, par la croyance qu’elles ont une existence à elles, donner à certaines choses que nous voyons une âme qu’elles gardent ensuite et qu’elles développent en nous. Toutes les idées que je m’étais faites des heures, différentes de celles qui existent pour les autres hommes, que passaient les Swann dans cet appartement qui était pour le temps quotidien de leur vie ce que le corps est pour l’âme, et qui devait en exprimer la singularité, toutes ces idées étaient réparties, amalgamées – partout également troublantes et indéfinissables – dans la place des meubles, dans l’épaisseur des tapis, dans l’orientation des fenêtres, dans le service des domestiques. Quand, après le déjeuner, nous allions, au soleil, prendre le café, dans la grande baie du salon, tandis que Mme Swann me demandait combien je voulais de morceaux de sucre dans mon café, ce n’était pas seulement le tabouret de soie qu’elle poussait vers moi qui dégageait, avec le charme douloureux que j’avais perçu autrefois – sous l’épine rose, puis à côté du massif de lauriers – dans le nom de Gilberte, l’hostilité que m’avaient témoignée ses parents et que ce petit meuble semblait avoir si bien sue et partagée, que je ne me sentais pas digne et que je me trouvais un peu lâche d’imposer mes pieds à son capitonnage sans défense ; une âme personnelle le reliait secrètement à la lumière de deux heures de l’après-midi, différente de ce qu’elle était partout ailleurs dans le golfe où elle faisait jouer à nos pieds ses flots d’or parmi lesquels les canapés bleuâtres et les vaporeuses tapisseries émergeaient comme des îles enchantées ; et il n’était pas jusqu’au tableau de Rubens accroché au-dessus de la cheminée qui ne possédât lui aussi le même genre et presque la même puissance de charme que les bottines à lacets de M. Swann et ce manteau à pèlerine, dont j’avais tant désiré porter le pareil et que maintenant Odette demandait à son mari de remplacer par un autre, pour être plus élégant, quand je leur faisais l’honneur de sortir avec eux. Elle allait s’habiller elle aussi, bien que j’eusse protesté qu’aucune robe « de ville » ne vaudrait à beaucoup près la merveilleuse robe de chambre de crêpe de Chine ou de soie, vieux rose, cerise, rose Tiepolo, blanche, mauve, verte, rouge, jaune unie ou à dessins, dans laquelle Mme Swann avait déjeuné et qu’elle allait ôter. Quand je disais qu’elle aurait dû sortir ainsi, elle riait, par moquerie de mon ignorance ou plaisir de mon compliment. Elle s’excusait de posséder tant de peignoirs parce qu’elle prétendait qu’il n’y avait que là dedans qu’elle se sentait bien et elle nous quittait pour aller mettre une de ces toilettes souveraines qui s’imposaient à tous, et entre lesquelles pourtant j’étais parfois appelé à choisir celle que je préférais qu’elle revêtit.","And yet this apartment, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann's will, must have retained a certain sweetness for him, if I judged by myself for whom it had not lost all mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed that the life of the Swanns was bathed, I had not entirely driven out of their house by entering it; I had pushed him back, tamed as he was by this stranger, this pariah that I had been and to whom Mademoiselle Swann was now advancing gracefully so that a delicious, hostile and scandalized armchair could take its place there; but all around me, this charm, in my memory, I still perceive it. Is it because, on those days when Mr. and Mrs. Swann invited me to lunch, to then go out with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze – while I waited alone – on the carpet, on the easy chairs, on the consoles, on the screens, on the pictures, the idea engraved in my mind that Madame Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was going to come in? Is it because these things have since lived in my memory alongside the Swanns and have come to take something from them? Was it that, knowing that they spent their existence among them, did I make of them all the emblems of their particular life, of their habits from which I had been excluded for too long for them not to continue to seem foreign even when they did me the favor of mingling with them? In any case, each time I think of this salon that Swann (without this criticism implying on his part the intention of in any way contradicting his wife's tastes) found so disparate - because everything conceived that it was still in the half-greenhouse, half-workshop taste that was that of the apartment where he had known Odette, she had nevertheless begun to replace in this jumble many of the Chinese objects which she now found a little ""fake"", quite ""next"". , by a host of small pieces of furniture upholstered in old Louis XIV silks (not to mention the masterpieces brought by Swann from the hôtel du quai d'Orléans) – on the contrary, in my memory, this composite living room has a cohesion , a unity, an individual charm that even the most intact ensembles that the past has bequeathed to us never have, nor the most alive ones where the imprint of a person is marked; for we alone can, by the belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain things that we see a soul which they then keep and develop in us. All the ideas that I had formed for hours, different from those that exist for other men, that the Swanns spent in this apartment which was for the daily time of their life what the body is for the soul, and which had to express its singularity, all these ideas were distributed, amalgamated – everywhere equally disturbing and indefinable – in the placement of the furniture, in the thickness of the carpets, in the orientation of the windows, in the service of the servants. When, after lunch, we went to the sun to have coffee in the large bay window of the living room, while Madame Swann asked me how many sugar cubes I wanted in my coffee, it was not only the silk stool which she pushed towards me which released, with the painful charm that I had once perceived – under the pink thorn, then next to the clump of laurels – in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shown me and that this little piece of furniture seemed to have known and shared so well, that I did not feel worthy and that I found myself a little cowardly to impose my feet on its defenseless upholstery; a personal soul connected him secretly to the light of two o'clock in the afternoon, different from what it was everywhere else in the gulf where it made its golden waves play at our feet among which the bluish sofas and the vaporous tapestries emerged like enchanted islands; and even the picture by Rubens hung above the fireplace also possessed the same kind and almost the same power of charm as M. Swann's lace-up boots and that pelerine coat, whose I had so wanted to wear the same and now Odette asked her husband to replace it with another, to be more elegant, when I did them the honor of going out with them. She was going to dress herself too, although I had protested that no ""city"" dress was nearly worth the marvelous dressing gown of crepe de chine or silk, old rose, cherry, Tiepolo rose, white, mauve, green, red, plain or patterned yellow, in which Madame Swann had lunched and which she was going to take away. When I said she should have gone out like this, she laughed, mocking my ignorance or enjoying my compliment. She apologized for owning so many bathrobes because she claimed that the only thing in them was that she felt good, and she left us to go and put on one of those sovereign toilets that everyone imposed on them, and between which, however, I was sometimes called upon to choose the one I preferred for her to wear.","And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte , I imprinted with my gaze,—while I sat waiting for them there alone—on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their existence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing–room which Swann (not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife's taste) found so incongruous—because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d'Orléans—it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that exist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give expression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated—equally disturbing and indefinite throughout—in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing–room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk–covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt—first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels—in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o'clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney–piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress—not heeding my protestations that no 'outdoor' clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crêpe–de–Chine or silk, old rose, cherry–coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on.","And yet my own experience told me that, because Swann had subjected that flat to such an intensity of purposeful desire, he must surely have found in it something of its former charm, just as it had not lost all its mystery for me. By entering their house, I had not completely banished from it the strange, fascinating element in which I had for such a long time imagined the Swanns having their being; I had tamed it a little, I had made it retreat in the face of the outsider I had been, the outcast to whom Mlle Swann now graciously offered a delightful, hostile and scandalized armchair; and that charm, through memory, I can still feel close to me. Is this perhaps because, while I sat waiting on those days when M. and Mme Swann invited me to have lunch and then share their afternoon outing with Gilberte, my eyes reproduced – all over the carpet, the armchairs, the sideboards, the screens and the paintings – the idea which was deeply imprinted in me, that Mme Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte were just about to come into the room? Was it because these objects have gone on living beside the Swanns in my memory and have at length absorbed something of them? Was it because, knowing the Swanns spent their lives among them, I had come to see all these things as the emblems of their special existence and of their habits, from which I had been too long excluded for their furniture not to go on seeming alien to me, even after I had been granted the boon of using it? For whatever reason, nowadays when I remember that drawing-room which Swann, without his objection to it implying in any way an intention to go against the wishes of his wife, saw as such a jumble of styles (because though its design was still based on the concept of the greenhouse-cum-workshop which had been the guiding principle of Odette’s house when he had first known her, she had begun to weed out of this medley some of the Chinese items, which she thought now a little ‘sham’, quite ‘stale’, but replacing them with a clutter of little pieces upholstered in old Louis XVI silks, to which of course were added the masterpieces brought by Swann himself from his old hôtel on the quai d’Orléans) , I see its disparities in retrospect as forming a homogeneous, unified whole, as giving it an individual charm; and these are features one can never see in even the most coherent and uniform compilations left to us from the past, or in those most vividly marked by the imprint of a single person, for it is only ever we ourselves, through our belief that things seen have an existence of their own, who can impart to some of them a soul which lives in them, and which they then develop in us. All the fancies I had formed about the hours spent by the Swanns, different from those which other people experience, in that house which, by being to the daily tissue of their existence in time what the body is to the soul, was bound to express the unique quality of their life, were shared by whatever I saw, absorbed into the positioning of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the outlook from the windows, the attentions of the servants, equally thrilling and indefinable in them all. After lunch, when we went through into the drawing-room to have coffee, sitting in the broad and sunny bay-window, and Mme Swann asked me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not just the silk-covered footstool that she moved towards me which gave off both the painful charm I used to sense in the name of Gilberte (through the pink hawthorn, then near the clump of laurels) and also the suspicion with which her parents had viewed me, and which this little footstool had apparently known of and shared so vehemently that I now felt unworthy and a little cowardly in placing my feet on its defenceless upholstery; a personal soul made it secretly one with the light of two o’clock in the afternoon, light which was unique to this bay, as it dappled our feet with its golden waves and lapped about the enchanted islands of the bluish sofas and hazy tapestries; and even the Rubens hanging above the mantelpiece glowed with the same kind of charm, almost the same potency of charm, as M. Swann’s lace-up boots and Inverness cape, the like of which I had longed to wear, and which Odette now asked him to go and change for another overcoat, so as to look more elegant when I did them the honour of going out with them. She too went to change, despite my protests that no walking-dress could possibly become her as much as the superb crêpe de Chine or silk tea-gown, in old rose or cherry, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, self-coloured or with a design, in which she had sat with us having lunch and was now about to remove. When I told her she should wear it for going out, she would laugh, either in mockery of my naïvety or pleasure at my compliment. She apologized for having so many tea-gowns, saying they were the only garments in which she felt comfortable, then went to put on one of those breathtaking outfits that made all heads turn, after having invited me at times to choose the one I preferred to see her wear."
"Cette route était pareille à bien d’autres de ce genre qu’on rencontre en France, montant en pente assez raide, puis redescendant sur une grande longueur. Au moment même, je ne lui trouvais pas un grand charme, j’étais seulement content de rentrer. Mais elle devint pour moi dans la suite une cause de joies en restant dans ma mémoire comme une amorce où toutes les routes semblables sur lesquelles je passerais plus tard au cours d’une promenade ou d’un voyage s’embrancheraient aussitôt sans solution de continuité et pourraient, grâce à elle, communiquer immédiatement avec mon cœur. Car dès que la voiture ou l’automobile s’engagerait dans une de ces routes qui auraient l’air d’être la continuation de celle que j’avais parcourue avec Mme de Villeparisis, ce à quoi ma conscience actuelle se trouverait immédiatement appuyée comme à mon passé le plus récent, ce serait (toutes les années intermédiaires se trouvant abolies) les impressions que j’avais eues par ces fins d’après-midi-là, en promenade près de Balbec, quand les feuilles sentaient bon, que la brume s’élevait et qu’au delà du prochain village on apercevrait entre les arbres le coucher du soleil comme s’il avait été quelque localité suivante, forestière, distante et qu’on n’atteindra pas le soir même. Raccordées à celles que j’éprouvais maintenant dans un autre pays, sur une route semblable, s’entourant de toutes les sensations accessoires de libre respiration, de curiosité, d’indolence, d’appétit, de gaieté qui leur étaient communes, excluant toutes les autres, ces impressions se renforceraient, prendraient la consistance d’un type particulier de plaisir, et presque d’un cadre d’existence que j’avais d’ailleurs rarement l’occasion de retrouver, mais dans lequel le réveil des souvenirs mettait au milieu de la réalité matériellement perçue une part assez grande de réalité évoquée, songée, insaisissable, pour me donner, au milieu de ces régions où je passais, plus qu’un sentiment esthétique, un désir fugitif mais exalté, d’y vivre désormais pour toujours. Que de fois, pour avoir simplement senti une odeur de feuillée, être assis sur un strapontin en face de Mme de Villeparisis, croiser la princesse de Luxembourg qui lui envoyait des bonjours de sa voiture, rentrer dîner au Grand-Hôtel, ne m’est-il pas apparu comme un de ces bonheurs ineffables que ni le présent ni l’avenir ne peuvent nous rendre et qu’on ne goûte qu’une fois dans la vie.","This road was like many others of this kind that you meet in France, going up quite steeply, then going down again for a long time. At the same time, I did not find him a great charm, I was only happy to return. But it later became a source of joy for me, remaining in my memory like a beginning where all the similar roads on which I would pass later during a walk or a trip would immediately branch off without any break in continuity. and could, thanks to it, communicate immediately with my heart. Because as soon as the car or the automobile would engage in one of these roads which would seem to be the continuation of that which I had traveled with Madame de Villeparisis, on which my present conscience would find itself immediately supported as to my most recent past, it would be (all the intervening years being abolished) the impressions I had had on those late afternoons, on a walk near Balbec, when the leaves smelled good, that the mist was rising and that beyond the next village we would see the sunset between the trees as if it had been some following locality, forest, distant and which we would not reach that very evening. Connected to those I now experienced in another country, on a similar road, surrounding itself with all the accessory sensations of free breathing, curiosity, indolence, appetite, cheerfulness which were common to them, excluding all the others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a framework of existence that I rarely had the opportunity to rediscover, but in which the awakening of memories put in the midst of materially perceived reality a large enough share of evoked, thoughtful, elusive reality to give me, in the midst of these regions through which I passed, more than an aesthetic feeling, a fleeting but exalted desire to live there henceforth for all time. How many times, for having simply smelled the smell of leaves, sitting on a folding seat opposite Madame de Villeparisis, meeting the Princess of Luxembourg who was sending her greetings from her car, returning to dinner at the Grand-Hotel, - it did not appear as one of those ineffable joys that neither the present nor the future can give us back and that we only taste once in a lifetime.","This road was like many others of the same kind which are to be found in France, climbing on a fairly steep gradient to its summit and then gradually falling for the rest of the way. At the time, I found no great attraction in it, I was only glad to be going home. But it became for me later on a frequent source of joy by remaining in my memory as a lodestone to which all the similar roads that I was to take, on walks or drives or journeys, would at once attach themselves without breach of continuity and would be able, thanks to it, to communicate directly with my heart. For as soon as the carriage or the motor–car turned into one of these roads that seemed to be merely the continuation of the road along which I had driven with Mme. de Villeparisis, the matter to which I found my consciousness directly applying itself, as to the most recent event in my past, would be (all the intervening years being quietly obliterated) the impressions that I had had on those bright summer afternoons and evenings, driving round Balbec, when the leaves smelt good, a mist rose from the ground, and beyond the village close at hand one could see through the trees the sun setting as though it had been merely some place farther along the road, a forest place and distant, which we should not have time to reach that evening. Harmonised with what I was feeling now in another place, on a similar road, surrounded by all the accessory sensations of breathing deep draughts of air, of curiosity, indolence, appetite, lightness of heart which were common to them both, and excluding all others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a setting of life which, as it happened, I rarely had the luck to–come across, but in which these awakened memories placed, amid the reality that my senses could perceive, no small part of a reality suggested, dreamed, unseizable, to give me, among those regions through which I was passing, more than an aesthetic feeling, a transient but exalted ambition to stay there and to live there always. How often since then, simply because I could smell green leaves, has not being seated on a back–seat opposite Mme. de Villeparisis, meeting the Princesse de Luxembourg who waved a greeting to her from her own carriage, coming back to dinner at the Grand Hotel appeared to me as one of those indescribable happinesses which neither the present nor the future can restore to us, which we may taste once only in a lifetime.","This road was similar to many another French road of the same kind, first a steep climb, then a long gentle downward slope. At the time, it did not impress me as having any great charm; I was just glad to be on the way home. But in later years, it did come to be a source of other joys, by staying in my memory as a starting-point giving immediate access to all similar roads which I would travel in the future, on a short outing or a longer journey, and which because of it were able to take a short-cut to my heart. For as soon as the later carriage or motor turned into one of those roads which resembled a stretch of the one I had driven along in Mme de Villeparisis’s carriage, what adjoined my then consciousness, as contiguously as though it was my most recent past, abolishing all the intervening years, was the impressions in my mind on those late afternoons, after the horses’ heads had been set towards Balbec, when we drove through the lovely smell of leaves into the rising mists and could see the sunset, beyond the next village, through the trees, looking just like one of the next wooded localities along that road, but rather too distant for us to reach it before nightfall. These impressions, mingling with the ones I would be experiencing in that other place, on that similar road, and surrounded by all the accessory feelings which were common to both states, and only by them – the sensation of breathing freely, curiosity, the enjoyment of being lazy, a good appetite, cheerfulness – would grow in volume, take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, almost of a way of existence, one which I seldom had occasion to revisit but within which reawakened memories blended a physically perceived reality with enough remembered, fancied, ungraspable reality for these places I was passing through to give me, not just an aesthetic experience, but a heady desire, however fleeting, to live there for ever. How often the mere breath of trees in full leaf has made me see the act of sitting on a bracket-seat opposite Mme de Villeparisis, as she acknowledges the greeting of the Princess of Luxembourg passing by in her carriage, then driving home to dinner at the Grand-Hôtel, as among those inexpressible joys of life which neither the present nor the future can ever bring back, which can be tasted once and once only!"
Padoue est un fort bel endroit,Padua is a beautiful place,Padoue est un fort bel endroit,Padoue est un fort bel endroit
"Or, en sortant du concert, comme, en reprenant le chemin qui va vers l’hôtel, nous nous étions arrêtés un instant sur la digue, ma grand’mère et moi, pour échanger quelques mots avec Mme de Villeparisis qui nous annonçait qu’elle avait commandé pour nous à l’hôtel des « Croque-Monsieur » et des œufs à la crème, je vis de loin venir dans notre direction la princesse de Luxembourg, à demi appuyée sur une ombrelle de façon à imprimer à son grand et merveilleux corps cette légère inclinaison, à lui faire dessiner cette arabesque si chère aux femmes qui avaient été belles sous l’Empire et qui savaient, les épaules tombantes, le dos remonté, la hanche creuse, la jambe tendue, faire flotter mollement leur corps comme un foulard, autour de l’armature d’une invisible tige inflexible et oblique, qui l’aurait traversé. Elle sortait tous les matins faire son tour de plage presque à l’heure où tout le monde après le bain remontait pour déjeuner, et comme le sien était seulement à une heure et demie, elle ne rentrait à sa villa que longtemps après que les baigneurs avaient abandonné la digue déserte et brûlante. Mme de Villeparisis présenta ma grand’mère, voulut me présenter, mais dut me demander mon nom, car elle ne se le rappelait pas. Elle ne l’avait peut-être jamais su, ou en tous cas avait oublié depuis bien des années à qui ma grand’mère avait marié sa fille. Ce nom parut faire une vive impression sur Mme de Villeparisis. Cependant la princesse de Luxembourg nous avait tendu la main et, de temps en temps, tout en causant avec la marquise, elle se détournait pour poser de doux regards sur ma grand’mère et sur moi, avec cet embryon de baiser qu’on ajoute au sourire quand celui-ci s’adresse à un bébé avec sa nounou. Même dans son désir de ne pas avoir l’air de siéger dans une sphère supérieure à la nôtre, elle avait sans doute mal calculé la distance, car, par une erreur de réglage, ses regards s’imprégnèrent d’une telle bonté que je vis approcher le moment où elle nous flatterait de la main comme deux bêtes sympathiques qui eussent passé la tête vers elle, à travers un grillage, au Jardin d’Acclimatation. Aussitôt du reste cette idée d’animaux et de bois de Boulogne prit plus de consistance pour moi. C’était l’heure où la digue est parcourue par des marchands ambulants et criards qui vendent des gâteaux, des bonbons, des petits pains. Ne sachant que faire pour nous témoigner sa bienveillance, la princesse arrêta le premier qui passa ; il n’avait plus qu’un pain de seigle, du genre de ceux qu’on jette aux canards. La princesse le prit et me dit : « C’est pour votre grand’mère. » Pourtant, ce fut à moi qu’elle le tendit, en me disant avec un fin sourire : « Vous le lui donnerez vous-même », pensant qu’ainsi mon plaisir serait plus complet s’il n’y avait pas d’intermédiaires entre moi et les animaux. D’autres marchands s’approchèrent, elle remplit mes poches de tout ce qu’ils avaient, de paquets tout ficelés, de plaisirs, de babas et de sucres d’orge. Elle me dit : « Vous en mangerez et vous en ferez manger aussi à votre grand’mère » et elle fit payer les marchands par le petit nègre habillé en satin rouge qui la suivait partout et qui faisait l’émerveillement de la plage. Puis elle dit adieu à Mme de Villeparisis et nous tendit la main avec l’intention de nous traiter de la même manière que son amie, en intimes et de se mettre à notre portée. Mais cette fois, elle plaça sans doute notre niveau un peu moins bas dans l’échelle des êtres, car son égalité avec nous fut signifiée par la princesse à ma grand’mère au moyen de ce tendre et maternel sourire qu’on adresse à un gamin quand on lui dit au revoir comme à une grande personne. Par un merveilleux progrès de l’évolution, ma grand’mère n’était plus un canard ou une antilope, mais déjà ce que Mme Swann eût appelé un « baby ». Enfin, nous ayant quittés tous trois, la Princesse reprit sa promenade sur la digue ensoleillée en incurvant sa taille magnifique qui comme un serpent autour d’une baguette s’enlaçait à l’ombrelle blanche imprimée de bleu que Mme de Luxembourg tenait fermée à la main. C’était ma première altesse, je dis la première, car la princesse Mathilde n’était pas altesse du tout de façons. La seconde, on le verra plus tard, ne devait pas moins m’étonner par sa bonne grâce. Une forme de l’amabilité des grands seigneurs, intermédiaires bénévoles entre les souverains et les bourgeois, me fut apprise le lendemain quand Mme de Villeparisis nous dit : « Elle vous a trouvés charmants. C’est une femme d’un grand jugement, de beaucoup de cœur. Elle n’est pas comme tant de souveraines ou d’altesses. Elle a une vraie valeur. » Et Mme de Villeparisis ajouta d’un air convaincu, et toute ravie de pouvoir nous le dire : « Je crois qu’elle serait enchantée de vous revoir. »","Now, on leaving the concert, as, on returning to the road that goes towards the hotel, we had stopped for a moment on the dyke, my grandmother and I, to exchange a few words with Madame de Villeparisis who announced to us that she had ordered Croque-Monsieur and cream eggs for us at the hotel, I saw the Princess of Luxembourg coming from afar, leaning on a parasol so as to impress on her tall and marvelous body this slight inclination, to make it draw this arabesque so dear to women who had been beautiful under the Empire and who knew how, with drooping shoulders, upturned back, hollow hips, outstretched legs, to make their bodies float softly like a scarf, around the frame of an invisible inflexible and oblique rod, which would have crossed it. She went out every morning to do her rounds of the beach almost at the time when everyone after the bath came back up for lunch, and as hers was only at half past one, she did not return to her villa until long after the bathers had abandoned the deserted and burning dyke. Madame de Villeparisis introduced my grandmother, wanted to introduce me, but had to ask me my name, for she did not remember it. She had perhaps never known it, or at any rate had forgotten for many years to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. This name seemed to make a strong impression on Madame de Villeparisis. However, the Princess of Luxembourg had held out her hand to us and, from time to time, while chatting with the Marquise, she would turn away to cast gentle glances on my grandmother and on me, with that embryo of a kiss which is added smile when he speaks to a baby with his nanny. Even in her desire not to appear to be sitting in a higher sphere than ours, she had doubtless miscalculated the distance, for, through an error in the setting, her looks were imbued with such kindness that I I saw the moment approaching when she would stroke us with her hand like two friendly beasts who had poked their heads towards her through a fence in the Jardin d'Acclimatation. Immediately, moreover, this idea of animals and the Bois de Boulogne took on more substance for me. It was the hour when the dyke is traversed by itinerant and garish merchants who sell cakes, sweets, rolls. Not knowing what to do to show us her benevolence, the princess stopped the first who passed; he had only one rye bread left, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The princess took it and said to me: ""It's for your grandmother."" However, it was to me that she held it out, saying to me with a delicate smile: ""You will give it to him yourself"", thinking that in this way my pleasure would be more complete if there were no intermediaries between me and the animals. Other merchants approached, she filled my pockets with everything they had, all-tied parcels, pleasures, babas and barley sugars. She said to me: ""You will eat it and you will make your grandmother eat it too"" and she made the merchants pay by the little Negro dressed in red satin who followed her everywhere and who was the wonder of the beach. Then she said goodbye to Madame de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as her friend, as intimates and putting herself within our reach. But this time, she doubtless placed our level a little less low on the scale of beings, for her equality with us was signified by the princess to my grandmother by means of that tender and maternal smile which one addresses to a kid when we say goodbye to him like a grown-up. By a marvelous evolutionary progress, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but already what Madame Swann would have called a ""baby."" Finally, having left all three of us, the Princess resumed her walk on the sunny dyke, bending her magnificent figure which, like a snake around a wand, entwined itself with the white parasol printed with blue which Madame de Luxembourg held closed at the hand. She was my first highness, I say the first, because Princess Mathilde was not a highness at all in any way. The second, as we shall see later, was no less astonishing to me by its good grace. A form of the friendliness of the great lords, voluntary intermediaries between the sovereigns and the bourgeois, was taught to me the next day when Madame de Villeparisis said to us: “She found you charming. She is a woman of great judgment, with a lot of heart. She is not like so many sovereigns or highnesses. It has real value. And Madame de Villeparisis added with an air of conviction, and quite delighted to be able to tell us: “I think she would be delighted to see you again. »","Well, as we came out of the concert, and, on our way back to the hotel, had stopped for a moment on the 'front,' my grandmother and I, for a few words with Mme. de Villeparisis who told us that she had ordered some croque–monsieurs and a dish of creamed eggs for us at the hotel , I saw, a long way away, coming in our direction, the Princesse de Luxembourg, half leaning upon a parasol in such a way as to impart to her tall and wonderful form that slight inclination, to make it trace that arabesque dear to the women who had been beautiful under the Empire, and knew how, with drooping shoulders, arched backs, concave hips and bent limbs, to make their bodies float as gently as a silken scarf about the rigidity of the invisible stem which might be supposed to have been passed diagonally through them. She went out every morning for a turn on the beach almost at the time when everyone else, after bathing, was climbing home to luncheon, and as hers was not until half past one she did not return to her villa until long after the hungry bathers had left the scorching 'front' a desert. Mme. de Villeparisis presented my grandmother and would have presented me, but had first to ask me my name, which she could not remember. She had, perhaps, never known it, or if she had must have forgotten years ago to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. My name, when she did hear it, appeared to impress Mme. de Villeparisis considerably. Meanwhile the Princesse de Luxembourg had given us her hand and, now and again, while she conversed with the Marquise, turned to bestow a kindly glance on my grandmother and myself, with that embryonic kiss which we put into our smiles when they are addressed to a baby out with its 'Nana.' Indeed, in her anxiety not to appear to be a denizen of a higher sphere than ours, she had probably miscalculated the distance there was indeed between us, for by an error in adjustment she made her eyes beam with such benevolence that I could see the moment approaching when she would put out her hand and stroke us, as if we were two nice beasts and had poked our heads out at her through the bars of our cage in the Gardens. And, immediately, as it happened, this idea of caged animals and the Bois de Boulogne received striking confirmation. It was the time of day at which the beach is crowded by itinerant and clamorous vendors, hawking cakes and sweets and biscuits. Not knowing quite what to do to shew her affection for us, the Princess hailed the next that came by; he had nothing left but one rye–cake, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The Princess took it and said to me: ""For your grandmother."" And yet it was to me that she held it out, saying with a friendly smile, ""You shall give it to her yourself!"" thinking that my pleasure would thus be more complete if there were no intermediary between myself and the animals. Other vendors came up; she stuffed my pockets with everything that they had, tied up in packets, comfits, sponge–cakes, sugar–sticks. ""You will eat some yourself,"" she told me, ""and give some to your grandmother,"" and she had the vendors paid by the little Negro page, dressed in red satin, who followed her everywhere and was a nine days' wonder upon the beach. Then she said good–bye to Mme. de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as she treated her friend, as people whom she knew, and of bringing herself within our reach. But this time she must have reckoned our level as not quite so low in the scale of creation, for her and our equality was indicated by the Princess to my grandmother by that tender and maternal smile which a woman gives a little boy when she says good–bye to him as though to a grown–up person. By a miraculous stride in evolution, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but had already become what the anglophil Mme. Swann would have called a 'baby.' Finally, having taken leave of us all, the Princess resumed her stroll along the basking 'front,' curving her splendid shape which, like a serpent coiled about a wand, was interlaced with the white parasol patterned in blue which Mme. de Luxembourg held, unopened, in her hand. She was my first Royalty —I say my first, for strictly speaking Princesse Mathilde did not count. The second, as we shall see in due course, was to astonish me no less by her indulgence. One of the ways in which our great nobles, kindly intermediaries between commoners and kings, can befriend us was revealed to me next day when Mme. de Villeparisis reported: ""She thought you quite charming. She is a woman of the soundest judgment, the warmest heart. Not like so many Queens and people! She has real merit."" And Mme. de Villeparisis went on in a tone of conviction, and quite thrilled to be able to say it to us: "" I am sure she would be delighted to see you again.""","We were coming up from the concert and turning our steps towards the hotel, pausing for a moment on the esplanade with Mme de Villeparisis, who told us she had ordered ‘rarebits’ and creamed eggs for our lunch, when I caught sight of the Princess of Luxembourg, still quite a way off, but coming in our direction. As she walked, she was almost leaning on a sunshade, in a way that gave to her tall and wonderful body a slight inclination, a long undulation, so much a part of women who were beautiful during the Second Empire, and whose drooping shoulders and raised back, whose gaunt hips and slow, fluid stride swayed a silky ripple through their whole person, as though an invisible, inflexible rod slanted through their bodies and they were trying at each step to drape themselves about it. When she went out for her morning stroll along the esplanade, it was always about the time when everyone else who had been down for a swim was coming back up for lunch; and her own lunch-time being half-past one, she never got back to her villa until long after the bathers had abandoned the esplanade, which stretched empty before her in the full glare of the sun. Mme de Villeparisis introduced my grandmother to her; but when it was my turn to be introduced, unable to remember my surname, she had to ask me what it was. She may actually never have known, or if she had, she had forgotten years before the name of the man to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. On hearing it now, Mme de Villeparisis seemed much struck by it. The Princess of Luxembourg, having shaken hands, stood chatting with the Marquise, glancing tenderly now and then at my grandmother and me with an expression full of the incipient kiss that rises to lips which smile at a baby with his nanny. Despite her wish not to appear to dwell in spheres far above ours, she must have misjudged the distance between us; and her eyes, not properly adjusted, overflowed with such loving sweetness that I would not have been surprised if she had reached out a hand and patted us, as though we were a brace of docile animals poking our heads through the railings at the Zoo in the Bois de Boulogne. This idea of being animals in the Zoo was instantly underlined for me. It was the hour when hawkers of sweets, cakes and other delicacies haunt the esplanade, barking their wares in strident tones. At a loss to show her good-will towards us in a fitting manner, the Princess stopped the next one who came along. All he had left was a little loaf of rye-bread, the sort you feed to the ducks. The Princess took it, saying to me, ‘This is for your grandmother.’ But she then handed it to me, with a smile full of feeling: ‘You be the one to give it to her,’ meaning no doubt that my enjoyment would be greater if nobody came between me and the animals. Other hawkers having gathered round us, she filled my pockets with all sorts of things, little surprise packets tied with string, rolled wafers, babas, barley sugars: ‘ These are for you to eat. But you must let your grandmother have some too.’ The hawkers were paid, at the Princess’s behest, by the little black boy in a red satin suit who always walked behind her, to the amazement of the whole sea-front. Taking leave of Mme de Villeparisis, she proffered us a hand once again, trying to show that she treated her friends and the friends of her friends exactly alike, and that she had not lost the common touch. This time, however, her expression was aimed at not quite so lowly a level in the hierarchy of creatures; and the equality she shared with us was notified to my grandmother in the doting motherly smile with which one takes leave of a small boy when pretending he is a grown-up. My grandmother, by a vast stride of evolution, had stopped being a duck or an antelope and had turned into what Mme Swann would have termed, in her best English, a ‘baby’. Having taken her leave of us, the Princess of Luxembourg, with the slow undulations of her magnificent figure, took up again her interrupted stroll along the sun-drenched esplanade, her whole person winding itself round the rolled-up blue and white sunshade she held in her hand, as a snake coils about a wand. She was my very first Highness, not counting Princesse Mathilde, who in any case had nothing high and mighty about her. My second one, as will be seen, was to astonish me just as much by her graciousness. I was to become acquainted with one mode of the civility of the great the very next day, when Mme de Villeparisis gave us this report: ‘She thought you were both just charming. She’s a woman of great discernment, and her heart’s in the right place. She’s quite unlike your ordinary Highness or Royal – she’s a woman of genuine qualities.’ To which she added, with an expression of conviction, very pleased at being able to say so: ‘I expect she would be delighted to meet you again.’"
"À partir de cet après-midi-là, moi, qui les jours précédents avais surtout pensé à la grande, ce fut celle aux clubs de golf, présumée être Mlle Simonet, qui recommença à me préoccuper. Au milieu des autres, elle s’arrêtait souvent, forçant ses amies qui semblaient la respecter beaucoup, à interrompre aussi leur marche. C’est ainsi, faisant halte, les yeux brillants sous son « polo » que je la revois encore maintenant silhouettée sur l’écran que lui fait, au fond, la mer, et séparée de moi par un espace transparent et azuré, le temps écoulé depuis lors, première image, toute mince dans mon souvenir, désirée, poursuivie, puis oubliée, puis retrouvée, d’un visage que j’ai souvent depuis projeté dans le passé pour pouvoir me dire d’une jeune fille qui était dans ma chambre : « C’est elle ! »","From that afternoon onwards, I, who on the preceding days had mainly thought of the tall girl, it was the one with the golf clubs, presumed to be Mlle Simonet, who began to worry again. In the middle of the others, she often stopped, forcing her friends who seemed to respect her very much, to also interrupt their walk. It is thus, stopping, her eyes shining under her polo shirt, that I can still see her silhouetted on the screen that the sea gives her in the background, and separated from me by a transparent and azure space, time elapsed since then, first image, very thin in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then rediscovered, of a face that I have often since projected into the past to be able to tell myself of a young girl who was in my room: ""It's her! »","From that moment, whereas for the last few days my mind had been occupied chiefly by the tall one, it was the one with the golf–clubs, presumed to be Mlle. Simonet, who began once more to absorb my attention. When walking with the others she would often stop, forcing her friends, who seemed greatly to respect her, to stop also. Thus it is, calling a halt, her eyes sparkling beneath her polo–cap, that I see her again to–day, outlined against the screen which the sea spreads out behind her, and separated from me by a transparent, azure space, the interval of time that has elapsed since then, a first impression, faint and fine in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then found again, of a face which I have many times since projected upon the cloud of the past to be able to say to myself, of a girl who was actually in my room: ""It is she!""","From that moment on, although until then I had been thinking mostly about the tall one, it was once more the girl with the golf-clubs, whom I assumed to be Mlle Simonet, who preoccupied me. Walking along with the others, she would often stop, making her friends, who seemed to respect her greatly, also come to a standstill. That is how I see her to this day: standing there, her eyes shining under her toque, silhouetted against the backdrop of the sea, and separated from me by the transparent sky-blue stretch of time elapsed since that moment, the first glimpse of her in my memory, a very slight image of a face first desired and pursued, then forgotten, then found again, a face which since then I have often projected into the past, so as to say to myself, of a girl with me in my bedroom, ‘That was her!’"
"– Je dois ajouter, pour être tout à fait juste, qu’il y va cependant des femmes, mais… appartenant plutôt… , comment dirais-je, au monde républicain qu’à la société de Swann (il prononçait Svann). Qui sait ? Ce sera peut-être un jour un salon politique ou littéraire. Du reste, il semble qu’ils soient contents comme cela. Je trouve que Swann le montre un peu trop. Il nommait les gens chez qui lui et sa femme étaient invités pour la semaine suivante et de l’intimité desquels il n’y a pourtant pas lieu de s’enorgueillir, avec un manque de réserve et de goût, presque de tact, qui m’a étonné chez un homme aussi fin. Il répétait : « Nous n’avons pas un soir de libre », comme si ç’avait été une gloire, et en véritable parvenu, qu’il n’est pas cependant. Car Swann avait beaucoup d’amis et même d’amies, et sans trop m’avancer, ni vouloir commettre d’indiscrétion, je crois pouvoir dire que non pas toutes, ni même le plus grand nombre, mais l’une au moins, et qui est une fort grande dame, ne se serait peut-être pas montrée entièrement réfractaire à l’idée d’entrer en relations avec Madame Swann, auquel cas, vraisemblablement, plus d’un mouton de Panurge aurait suivi. Mais il semble qu’il n’y ait eu de la part de Swann aucune démarche esquissée en ce sens. Comment ? encore un pudding à la Nasselrode ! Ce ne sera pas de trop de la cure de Carlsbad pour me remettre d’un pareil festin de Lucullus… Peut-être Swann a-t-il senti qu’il y aurait trop de résistances à vaincre. Le mariage, cela est certain, n’a pas plu. On a parlé de la fortune de la femme, ce qui est une grosse bourde. Mais, enfin, tout cela n’a pas paru agréable. Et puis Swann a une tante excessivement riche et admirablement posée, femme d’un homme qui, financièrement parlant, est une puissance. Et non seulement elle a refusé de recevoir Mme Swann, mais elle a mené une campagne en règle pour que ses amies et connaissances en fissent autant. Je n’entends pas par là qu’aucun Parisien de bonne compagnie ait manqué de respect à Madame Swann… Non ! cent fois non ! le mari était d’ailleurs homme à relever le gant. En tous cas, il y a une chose curieuse, c’est de voir combien Swann, qui connaît tant de monde et du plus choisi, montre d’empressement auprès d’une société dont le moins qu’on puisse dire est qu’elle est fort mêlée. Moi qui l’ai connu jadis, j’avoue que j’éprouvais autant de surprise que d’amusement à voir un homme aussi bien élevé, aussi à la mode dans les coteries les plus triées, remercier avec effusion le directeur du Cabinet du ministre des Postes d’être venu chez eux et lui demander si Madame Swann pourrait se permettre d’aller voir sa femme. Il doit pourtant se trouver dépaysé ; évidemment ce n’est plus le même monde. Mais je ne crois pas cependant que Swann soit malheureux. Il y a eu, il est vrai, dans les années qui précédèrent le mariage, d’assez vilaines manœuvres de chantage de la part de la femme ; elle privait Swann de sa fille chaque fois qu’il lui refusait quelque chose. Le pauvre Swann, aussi naïf qu’il est pourtant raffiné, croyait chaque fois que l’enlèvement de sa fille était une coïncidence et ne voulait pas voir la réalité. Elle lui faisait d’ailleurs des scènes si continuelles qu’on pensait que le jour où elle serait arrivée à ses fins et se serait fait épouser, rien ne la retiendrait plus et que leur vie serait un enfer. Hé bien ! c’est le contraire qui est arrivé. On plaisante beaucoup la manière dont Swann parle de sa femme, on en fait même des gorges chaudes. On ne demandait certes pas que, plus ou moins conscient d’être… (vous savez le mot de Molière), il allât le proclamer urbi et orbi ; n’empêche qu’on le trouve exagéré quand il dit que sa femme est une excellente épouse. Or, ce n’est pas aussi faux qu’on le croit. À sa manière qui n’est pas celle que tous les maris préféreraient, – mais enfin, entre nous, il me semble difficile que Swann, qui la connaissait depuis longtemps et est loin d’être un maître-sot, ne sût pas à quoi s’en tenir, – il est indéniable qu’elle semble avoir de l’affection pour lui. Je ne dis pas qu’elle ne soit pas volage, et Swann lui-même ne se fait pas faute de l’être, à en croire les bonnes langues qui, vous pouvez le penser, vont leur train. Mais elle lui est reconnaissante de ce qu’il a fait pour elle, et, contrairement aux craintes éprouvées par tout le monde, elle paraît devenue d’une douceur d’ange.","– I must add, to be completely fair, that there are women, however, but… belonging more…, how shall I put it, to the republican world than to Swann’s society (he pronounced Svann). Who knows ? Perhaps one day it will be a political or literary salon. Besides, it seems that they are happy like that. I think Swann shows it a bit too much. He named the people to whom he and his wife were invited for the following week and of whose intimacy there is nevertheless no reason to be proud, with a lack of reserve and taste, almost of tact, which amazed in such a fine man. He repeated: ""We don't have a free evening,"" as if it had been a glory, and like a true upstart, which he is not, however. Because Swann had many friends and even girlfriends, and without going too far, nor wanting to commit any indiscretion, I think I can say that not all of them, nor even the greatest number, but one at least, and who is a very great lady, would perhaps not have shown herself to be entirely resistant to the idea of entering into relations with Madame Swann, in which case, in all likelihood, more than a sheep of Panurge would have followed. But it seems that there was no attempt on the part of Swann in this direction. How ? another Nasselrode pudding! It won't be too much of the cure at Carlsbad to recover from such a feast from Lucullus... Perhaps Swann sensed that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage, that is certain, did not please. We talked about the woman's fortune, which is a big blunder. But, in the end, all this did not seem pleasant. And then Swann has an exceedingly rich and admirably poised aunt, the wife of a man who, financially speaking, is a powerhouse. And not only did she refuse to receive Mrs. Swann, but she led a campaign in order to get her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean by this that any Parisian of good company has disrespected Madame Swann… No! a hundred times no! the husband was moreover a man to take up the gauntlet. In any case, there is a curious thing, it is to see how much Swann, who knows so many people and the most chosen, shows eagerness with a society of which the least that can be said is that it is very mixed. I who knew him formerly, I admit that I felt as much surprise as amusement to see a man so well-bred, so fashionable in the most select coteries, thank effusively the director of the Cabinet of the Minister des Postes for coming to their house and asking him if Madame Swann could afford to go and see his wife. He must, however, find himself out of place; obviously it's not the same world anymore. But I don't believe that Swann is unhappy. There were, it is true, in the years preceding the marriage, some rather nasty maneuvers of blackmail on the part of the wife; she deprived Swann of her daughter each time he refused her something. Poor Swann, as naive as he is yet refined, always believed that his daughter's kidnapping was a coincidence and did not want to see the reality. She made him scenes so continual that we thought that the day when she would have achieved her goals and would have been married, nothing would hold her back and that their life would be hell. Well ! the opposite has happened. We joke a lot the way Swann talks about his wife, we even make hot throats. It was certainly not asked that, more or less conscious of being... (you know Molière's phrase), he should go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; nevertheless, we find him exaggerated when he says that his wife is an excellent wife. However, this is not as false as one might think. In her own way, which is not the one that all husbands would prefer - but still, between us, it seems difficult to me that Swann, who had known her for a long time and is far from being a master fool, did not know what stick it out, - there's no denying that she seems to have some affection for him. I'm not saying that she isn't fickle, and Swann himself doesn't fail to be, according to the good tongues who, you can imagine, are going their way. But she is grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, contrary to everyone's fears, she seems to have become as sweet as an angel.","""In all fairness,"" he went on, ""I must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather—what shall I say—to the Republican world than to Swann's"" (he pronounced it ""Svann's"") ""circle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, 'We haven't a free evening!' as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over–bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann's part of any movement in that direction. ""What do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus–feast as this. ""Possibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage—so much is certain—was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife's having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann…. No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband's being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such exclusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well–bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an exile, don't you know; evidently, it's quite a different world. I don't think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child's disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it's become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly expect that, conscious, more or less of being a—(you remember Molière's line) he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way—which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to expect—there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.""","‘To be completely fair, he added, I must also say that there are women who go there. But they … belong – how shall I put it? – let’s say to the world of Republican sympathies, rather than to the world of Swann himself. (This name he pronounced Svann.) Who can tell? One day it may turn out to be a literary or political salon. Although they do appear to be quite satisfied with the present state of affairs. Swann himself actually makes it rather too obvious, if you ask me. I was taken aback that a man of such delicacy should be so brash and tactless, not to say tasteless, about dropping the names of people who’ve invited him and his wife to dinner next week – yet I can assure you they were not people one would be proud to be invited by! He kept on saying, “We’re not free on a single evening!” as though this was something to boast about, as though he was a vulgar outsider, which of course he isn’t. Once upon a time, after all, he did have many friends both male and female, and no doubt not all of the latter, perhaps not even most of them, but I do know for a fact that one of them – I believe one can go so far as to say this, without risking being indiscreet – who is a very great lady indeed, might not have evinced total reluctance at the suggestion of frequenting Mme Swann. And if that had happened, then very likely some more of Panurge’s sheep11 would have followed suit. However, it would appear that Swann put out no feelers in that direction. Ah, what’s this now? What, another Nessel-rode pudding! After such a feast of Lucullus, it will behove me to take the waters at Karlsbad! Mind you, Swann may well have sensed that it would have all been far too difficult. What’s clear is that the marriage was thoroughly deplored. Mention has been made of the wife’s money, but nothing could be further from the truth. However, people did think the whole thing was too unsavoury. And not only that but there was Swann’s aunt, a woman who’s hugely rich and very highly thought of, the wife of a man who, financially speaking, is a force to be reckoned with. Well, not only did she close her doors to Mme Swann, but she even conducted an all-out campaign to make sure all her friends and acquaintances did the same. I don’t mean to imply that anyone in the best Paris society actually cut her dead. No, no, of course not! The husband being, in any case, quite capable of sending round his seconds! Anyway, the strange thing about all of this is that Swann, with all his connections in the best society, lavishes such attention on company of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I used to know him quite well, and I must say I was both astounded and amused to see such a man, a man who’s so well bred, so much at home in the most fashionable and exclusive circles, falling over himself to thank the chief under-secretary of the Postmaster General’s for gracing him with a visit, asking him whether Mme Swann might feel free to call on his wife! He must feel out of his element. It’s so clearly not his world. And yet, you know, I don’t think the man’s unhappy. It’s true that the woman stooped to some pretty nasty things in the years before the marriage, some quite unsavoury emotional blackmail – if he ever declined to satisfy her on something or other, she just forbade him access to the child. And poor old Swann, who’s really as naïve as he’s refined, assumed each time that the disappearance of his daughter was mere coincidence, and would not see the truth of the matter. Also, she made him so miserable with her non-stop scenes that everyone thought that, if she ever had her way and got him to marry her, she would lead him a dog’s life, and the marriage would be a disaster. Then lo and behold, what happened was the very opposite! People take great pleasure in laughing behind Swann’s back at the way he goes on about his wife. Not that anyone expects a man who’s more or less aware of the fact that he’s a … – Molière’s word, you understand12 – to go about proclaiming it urbi et orbi. But still, people think he’s going a little too far when he tells you what a wonderful wife he’s got. Yet, you know, it’s not as far-fetched as they think. The way she behaves towards him, which is not the way all husbands would prefer – and, mind you, between you and me, it strikes me as improbable that Swann, who’s nobody’s fool and who had known her for years, didn’t have a shrewd suspicion about you-know-what – there can be no denying that she seems fond of him. I’m not saying she’s not still a bit flighty, and certainly Swann himself doesn’t let the grass grow under his feet in that regard, at least if one listens to what people say – and as you can imagine, people do say. But she’s grateful for what he has done for her; and notwithstanding all the dire forebodings voiced by everyone, she seems to have become as mild as can be.’"
Partie 3,Part 3,"No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received—in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi–relief a spray of forget–me–nots—the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aimé who was apparently 'off duty,' but by the lift–boy.","M. de Charlus must have regretted his words, for some time later I received another copy – morocco-bound and with a panel of incised leather on its front cover showing a sprig of forget-me-not in half-relief – of the book which he had lent me and which, it being Aimé’s day off, I had asked the ‘lift’ to take back to him."
"Et sans doute tout cela était vrai, mais c’était aussi par ennui de sentir que pour une bonne partie de la foule ils n’étaient, eux, que de bons bourgeois qui ne connaissaient pas ce roi et cette reine prodigues de leur monnaie, que le notaire, le président, le bâtonnier, au passage de ce qu’ils appelaient un carnaval, éprouvaient tant de mauvaise humeur et manifestaient tout haut une indignation au courant de laquelle était leur ami le maître d’hôtel, qui, obligé de faire bon visage aux souverains plus généreux qu’authentiques, cependant tout en prenant leur commande, adressait de loin à ses vieux clients un clignement d’œil significatif. Peut-être y avait-il aussi un peu de ce même ennui d’être par erreur crus moins « chic » et de ne pouvoir expliquer qu’ils l’étaient davantage, au fond du « Joli Monsieur ! » dont ils qualifiaient un jeune gommeux, fils poitrinaire et fêtard d’un grand industriel et qui, tous les jours, dans un veston nouveau, une orchidée à la boutonnière, déjeunait au champagne, et allait, pâle, impassible, un sourire d’indifférence aux lèvres, jeter au Casino sur la table de baccarat des sommes énormes « qu’il n’a pas les moyens de perdre » disait d’un air renseigné le notaire au premier président duquel la femme « tenait de bonne source » que ce jeune homme « fin de siècle » faisait mourir de chagrin ses parents.","And no doubt all that was true, but it was also out of boredom to feel that for a good part of the crowd they were only good bourgeois who did not know this king and this prodigal queen of their money, that the notary, the president, the president of the bar, during what they called a carnival, felt such a bad mood and expressed aloud an indignation of which their friend the butler was aware, who, obliged to do good face to sovereigns who are more generous than authentic, yet while taking their order, gave his old customers a significant wink from afar. Perhaps there was also a bit of this same boredom of being mistakenly believed to be less ""chic"" and of not being able to explain that they were more so, at the bottom of the ""Joli Monsieur!"" of which they described a gummy young man, the busty and party animal son of a great industrialist and who, every day, in a new jacket, an orchid in his buttonhole, lunched with champagne, and went, pale, impassive, a smile of a indifference to the lips, throwing huge sums on the baccarat table at the Casino ""which he does not have the means to lose"" said with an informed air the notary to whose first president the woman ""had a good source"" that this a young man at the end of the century was causing his parents to die of grief.","And I dare say it was all quite true: but it was also from resentment of the thought that, to many of their fellow–visitors, they were themselves simply respectable but rather common people who did not know this King and Queen so prodigal with their small change, that the solicitor, the magistrate, the barrister, when what they were pleased to call the 'Carnival' went by, felt so much annoyance, and expressed aloud an indignation that was quite understood by their friend the head waiter who, obliged to shew proper civility to these generous if not authentic Sovereigns, still, while he took their orders, would dart from afar at his old patrons a covert but speaking glance. Perhaps there was also something of the same resentment at being erroneously supposed to be less and unable to explain that they were more smart, underlining the 'fine specimen' with which they qualified a young 'blood,' the consumptive and dissipated son of an industrial magnate, who appeared every day in a new suit of clothes with an orchid in his buttonhole, drank champagne at luncheon, and then strolled out of the hotel, pale, impassive, a smile of complete indifference on his lips, to the casino to throw away at the baccarat table enormous sums, 'which he could ill afford to lose,' as the solicitor said with a resigned air to the chief magistrate, whose wife had it 'on good authority' that this 'detrimental' young man was bringing his parents' grey hair in sorrow to the grave.","No doubt all this was true; but it was also because they were miffed by the knowledge that, for much of the world, they themselves were mere provincials unacquainted with this open-handed royal couple, that the notable notary, the First President and the bâtonnier were so upset by witnessing what they called ‘a circus’ and voiced aloud their indignation, which was no secret to their friend the head waiter, who, though obliged to smile upon the more generous than genuine Royals, made a point, as he took their order, of addressing a distant but meaning wink at his regular customers. There may also have been something of the same chagrin at being mistakenly thought less ‘smart’ and being unable to explain that they were more ‘smart’, in the ‘Pretty fellow!’ with which they greeted the appearance of the young ‘masher’, the consumptive prodigal son of a great industrialist, who drank champagne every day with his lunch, wearing a new jacket with an orchid in its buttonhole, then took his impassive pallor and smile of indifference off to the baccarat tables at the Casino, where he squandered a fortune ‘Which he can ill afford to lose, believe you me,’ as the notary, with a knowing air, vouchsafed to the First President, whose wife had it ‘on the very best authority’ that this deplorably fin-de-siècle young man would be the death of his long-suffering parents."
"Quand le soir, après avoir conduit ma grand’mère et être resté quelques heures chez son amie, j’eus repris seul le train, du moins je ne trouvai pas pénible la nuit qui vint ; c’est que je n’avais pas à la passer dans la prison d’une chambre dont l’ensommeillement me tiendrait éveillé ; j’étais entouré par la calmante activité de tous ces mouvements du train qui me tenaient compagnie, s’offraient à causer avec moi si je ne trouvais pas le sommeil, me berçaient de leurs bruits que j’accouplais comme le son des cloches à Combray, tantôt sur un rythme, tantôt sur un autre (entendant selon ma fantaisie d’abord quatre doubles croches égales, puis une double croche furieusement précipitée contre une noire) ; ils neutralisaient la force centrifuge de mon insomnie en exerçant sur elle des pressions contraires qui me maintenaient en équilibre et sur lesquelles mon immobilité et bientôt mon sommeil se sentirent portés avec la même impression rafraîchissante que m’aurait donnée le repos dû à la vigilance de forces puissantes au sein de la nature et de la vie, si j’avais pu pour un moment m’incarner en quelque poisson qui dort dans la mer, promené dans son assoupissement par les courants et la vague, ou en quelque aigle étendu sur le seul appui de la tempête.","When in the evening, after driving my grandmother and staying a few hours at her friend's house, I had taken the train alone, at least I did not find the night that came to be painful; it was because I did not have to spend it in the prison of a room whose drowsiness would keep me awake; I was surrounded by the calming activity of all these movements of the train which kept me company, offered to chat with me if I could not find sleep, rocked me with their noises which I coupled like the sound of the bells in Combray , sometimes on one rhythm, sometimes on another (hearing according to my fancy first four equal sixteenth notes, then a furiously rushed sixteenth note against a quarter note); they neutralized the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exerting on it contrary pressures which kept me in balance and on which my immobility and soon my sleep felt carried with the same refreshing impression that the rest due to the vigilance of forces would have given me. powerful within nature and life, if I had been able for a moment to incarnate myself in some fish that sleeps in the sea, carried in its slumber by the currents and the wave, or in some eagle stretched out on the only storm support.","When, that evening, after having accompanied my grandmother to her destination and spent some hours in her friend's house, I had returned by myself to the train, at any rate I found nothing to distress me in the night which followed; this was because I had not to spend it in a room the somnolence of which would have kept me awake; I was surrounded by the soothing activity of all those movements of the train which kept me company, offered to stay and converse with me if I could not sleep, lulled me with their sounds which I wedded—as I had often wedded the chime of the Combray bells—now to one rhythm, now to another (hearing as the whim took me first four level and equivalent semi–quavers, then one semi–quaver furiously dashing against a crotchet); they neutralised the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exercising upon it a contrary pressure which kept me in equilibrium and on which my immobility and presently my drowsiness felt themselves to be borne with the same sense of refreshment that I should have had, had I been resting under the protecting vigilance of powerful forces, on the breast of nature and of life, had I been able for a moment to incarnate myself in a fish that sleeps in the sea, driven unheeding by the currents and the tides, or in an eagle outstretched upon the air, with no support but the storm.","That evening, having seen my grandmother to her friend’s house, where I stopped for a few hours, I once more took the train, alone this time, but at least not looking forward to an unpleasant night. For I was not going to have to spend it imprisoned in a bedroom in which I would be kept awake by the sleeping of all things round about; I was surrounded by the reposeful activity of all the train’s various movements, which kept me company, engaged me in a dialogue if I could not manage to sleep, soothed me with their noises which, as I used to do with the church-bells of Combray, I linked together sometimes in one particular rhythm, sometimes in another (fancying first that I could hear four equal semiquavers, then a single semiquaver banging violently against a crochet); and these noises neutralized the centrifugal force of my insomnia by pitting against it counter-pressures which kept me in a state of equilibrium, and on which my motionless and soon unconscious form felt itself supported with the same impression of release and relief as I would have drawn from sleep entrusted to the wild and wakeful forces of living nature, if I could have briefly turned into a fish asleep in the ocean swell, steered by the unknowing tides, or an eagle hanging on the wings of a high wind."
"Elle prenait aussi ses repas dans la salle à manger, mais à l’autre bout. Elle ne connaissait aucune des personnes qui habitaient l’hôtel ou y venaient en visite, pas même M. de Cambremer ; en effet, je vis qu’il ne la saluait pas, un jour où il avait accepté avec sa femme une invitation à déjeuner du bâtonnier, lequel, ivre de l’honneur d’avoir le gentilhomme à sa table, évitait ses amis des autres jours et se contentait de leur adresser de loin un clignement d’œil pour faire à cet événement historique une allusion toutefois assez discrète pour qu’elle ne pût pas être interprétée comme une invite à s’approcher.","She also took her meals in the dining room, but at the other end. She knew none of the people who lived in the hotel or came to visit it, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I saw that he did not greet her, one day when he had accepted with his wife an invitation to lunch from the president of the bar, who, drunk with the honor of having the gentleman at his table, avoided his friends from other days and contented himself with giving them a wink from afar to make an allusion to this historical event, however discreet enough that it could not be interpreted as an invitation to approach.","She, too, had her meals in the dining–room, but at the other end of it. She knew none of the people who were staying in the hotel, or who came there to call, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I noticed that he gave her no greeting, one day when, with his wife, he had accepted an invitation to take luncheon with the barrister, who drunken with the honour of having the nobleman at his table avoided his friends of every day, and confined himself to a distant twitch of the eyelid, so as to draw their attention to this historic event but so discreetly that his signal could not be interpreted by them as an invitation to join the party.","Mme de Villeparisis also took her meals in the dining-room, but she sat right at the other end. She was unacquainted with anyone who was staying in the hotel or who occasionally visited it, even with M. de Cambremer: I noticed that he did not greet her, one day when he and his wife came to lunch at the invitation of the bâtonnier from Cherbourg, who, intoxicated by the heady honour of having this noble at his table with him, made sure to keep away from his everyday acquaintances, at whom he just winked from a distance, to mark the historic occasion, but discreetly enough for them not to take this as permission to come over."

"– Comment, vous êtes le fils du marquis de Marsantes ? mais je l’ai très bien connu, dit à Saint-Loup M. Nissim Bernard. Je crus qu’il voulait dire « connu » au sens où le père de Bloch disait qu’il connaissait Bergotte, c’est-à-dire de vue. Mais il ajouta : « Votre père était un de mes bons amis. » Cependant Bloch était devenu excessivement rouge, son père avait l’air profondément contrarié, les demoiselles Bloch riaient en s’étouffant. C’est que chez M. Nissim Bernard le goût de l’ostentation, contenu chez M. Bloch le père et chez ses enfants, avait engendré l’habitude du mensonge perpétuel. Par exemple, en voyage à l’hôtel, M. Nissim Bernard, comme aurait pu faire M. Bloch le père, se faisait apporter tous ses journaux par son valet de chambre dans la salle à manger, au milieu du déjeuner, quand tout le monde était réuni, pour qu’on vît bien qu’il voyageait avec un valet de chambre. Mais aux gens avec qui il se liait dans l’hôtel, l’oncle disait, ce que le neveu n’eût jamais fait, qu’il était sénateur. Il avait beau être certain qu’on apprendrait un jour que le titre était usurpé, il ne pouvait au moment même résister au besoin de se le donner. M. Bloch souffrait beaucoup des mensonges de son oncle et de tous les ennuis qu’ils lui causaient. « Ne faites pas attention, il est extrêmement blagueur, dit-il à mi-voix à Saint-Loup qui n’en fut que plus intéressé, étant très curieux de la psychologie des menteurs. – Plus menteur encore que l’Ithaquesien Odysseus qu’Athènes appelait pourtant le plus menteur des hommes, compléta notre camarade Bloch. – Ah ! par exemple ! s’écria M. Nissim Bernard, si je m’attendais à dîner avec le fils de mon ami ! Mais j’ai à Paris chez moi, une photographie de votre père et combien de lettres de lui. Il m’appelait toujours « mon oncle », on n’a jamais su pourquoi. C’était un homme charmant, étincelant. Je me rappelle un dîner chez moi, à Nice, où il y avait Sardou, Labiche, Augier… – Molière, Racine, Corneille, continua ironiquement M. Bloch le père dont le fils acheva l’énumération en ajoutant : Plaute, Ménandre, Kalidasa. » M. Nissim Bernard blessé arrêta brusquement son récit et, se privant ascétiquement d’un grand plaisir, resta muet jusqu’à la fin du dîner.","– What, you are the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? but I knew him very well, said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint-Loup. I thought he meant ""known"" in the sense that Bloch's father said he knew Bergotte, that is to say by sight. But he added: “Your father was a good friend of mine. However Bloch had turned excessively red, his father looked deeply annoyed, the Bloch ladies laughed and choked. This is because in Mr. Nissim Bernard the taste for ostentation, contained in Mr. Bloch the father and in his children, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For example, on a trip to the hotel, Mr. Nissim Bernard, as Mr. Bloch the elder might have done, had all his newspapers brought by his valet to the dining room, in the middle of lunch, when everyone everyone was together, so that it could be seen that he was traveling with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel, the uncle said, which the nephew would never have done, that he was a senator. Although he was certain that people would one day learn that the title had been usurped, he could not even resist the urge to give it to himself. Mr. Bloch suffered greatly from his uncle's lies and from all the trouble they caused him. ""Don't pay attention, he's extremely joking,"" he said in a low voice to Saint-Loup, who was all the more interested, being very curious about the psychology of liars. ""Even more of a liar than the Ithaquesian Odysseus, whom Athens nevertheless called the most liar of men,"" added our comrade Bloch. – Ah! for example ! cried M. Nissim Bernard, ""if only I expected to dine with my friend's son!"" But I have in Paris at home a photograph of your father and how many letters from him. He always called me ""uncle"", we never knew why. He was a charming, sparkling man. I remember a dinner at my house, in Nice, where there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier… – Molière, Racine, Corneille, ironically continued Mr. Bloch the father whose son finished the list by adding: Plaute, Ménandre, Kalidasa . Mr. Nissim Bernard, wounded, abruptly stopped his story and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner.","""What! Are you the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? Why, I knew him very well,"" said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint– Loup. I supposed that he meant the word 'knew' in the sense in which Bloch's father had said that he knew Bergotte, namely by sight. But he went on: "" Your father was one of my best friends."" Meanwhile Bloch had turned very red, his father was looking intensely cross, the Misses Bloch were choking with suppressed laughter. The fact was that in M. Nissim Bernard the love of ostentation which in M. Bloch and his children was held in cheek, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For instance, if he was staying in an hotel, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch equally might have done, would have his newspapers brought to him always by his valet in the dining–room, in the middle of luncheon, when everybody was there, so that they should see that he travelled with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel the uncle used to say what the nephew would never have said, that he was a Senator. He might know quite well that they would sooner or later discover that the title was usurped; he could not, at the critical moment, resist the temptation to assume it. M. Bloch suffered acutely from his uncle's lies and from all the embarrassments that they led to. "" Don't pay any attention to him, he talks a great deal of nonsense,"" he whispered to Saint–Loup, whose interest was all the more whetted, for he was curious to explore the psychology of liars. "" A greater liar even than the Ithacan Odysseus, albeit Athene called him the greatest liar among mortals,"" his son completed the indictment. "" Well, upon my word!"" cried M. Nissim Bernard, ""If I'd only known that I was going to sit down to dinner with my old friend's son! Why, I have a photograph still of your father at home, in Paris, and any number of letters from him. He used always to call me 'uncle,' nobody ever knew why. He was a charming man, sparkling. I remember so well a dinner I gave at Nice; there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier,"" ""Molière, Racine, Corneille,"" M. Bloch added with sarcasm, while his son completed the tale of guests with ""Plautus, Menander, Kalidasa."" M. Nissim Bernard, cut to the quick, stopped short in his reminiscence, and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner.","‘What, do you mean you are the son of the Marquis de Marsantes?’ M. Nissim Bernard said to Saint-Loup. ‘I knew him well.’ I thought he must mean ‘knew’ in the way M. Bloch senior said he ‘knew’ Bergotte, by sight. But M. Nissim Bernard then added, ‘Your father was a good friend of mine.’ Young Bloch had turned extremely red, his father looked profoundly upset, Mesdemoiselles Bloch were stifling laughter. In M. Nissim Bernard, the art of showing off, which was curbed in M. Bloch senior and his offspring, had led to a habit of perpetual mendacity. If staying at a hotel when travelling, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch senior might have done, always had his manservant bring all the newspapers to him in the dining-room, in the middle of lunch, so that the other guests could see he was a man who travelled with a manservant. But if he struck up an acquaintance with any of these guests, M. Nissim Bernard would be sure to say he was a Senator, which his nephew would never have done. Although he knew perfectly well that it would come out one day that he had no right to this title, at the moment of speaking of it, he could not resist the temptation to acquire it. These lies told by his uncle, and the difficulties they could create, were a trial to M. Bloch. ‘Pay no attention,’ he murmured to Saint-Loup. ‘It’s just his way of making a little joke.’ Saint-Loup, who had a strong interest in the psychology of liars, was very interested in all of this. ‘ A bigger liar than Odysseus of Ithaca,’ said Bloch, ‘despite the fact that Athene said of the latter that he was the greatest liar among men. – Well, I must say, exclaimed M. Nissim Bernard, I did not expect to find myself dining with the son of my friend! I have in Paris a photograph of your father and any number of letters from him. He always called me “Uncle”, for some reason. A charming man, of sparkling wit. I remember a dinner I once gave in Nice, for Sardou, Labiche, Augier …75 – Molière, Racine, Corneille, M. Bloch senior continued ironically, his list being completed by his son: Plautus, Menander, Kalidasa. ’76 M. Nissim Bernard, with hurt feelings, abandoned his story, ascetically forgoing a great pleasure, and said not another word throughout the rest of dinner."
Et elle ajoutait :,And she added:,"And, finally, ""Come!","So, do come!"
"D’ailleurs peu à peu chaque refus de la voir me fit moins de peine. Et comme elle me devenait moins chère, mes souvenirs douloureux n’avaient plus assez de force pour détruire dans leur retour incessant la formation du plaisir que j’avais à penser à Florence, à Venise. Je regrettais à ces moments-là d’avoir renoncé à entrer dans la diplomatie et de m’être fait une existence sédentaire pour ne pas m’éloigner d’une jeune fille que je ne verrais plus et que j’avais déjà presque oubliée. On construit sa vie pour une personne et, quand enfin on peut l’y recevoir, cette personne ne vient pas, puis meurt pour vous et on vit prisonnier dans ce qui n’était destiné qu’à elle. Si Venise semblait à mes parents bien lointain et bien fiévreux pour moi, il était du moins facile d’aller sans fatigue s’installer à Balbec. Mais pour cela il eût fallu quitter Paris, renoncer à ces visites, grâce auxquelles, si rares qu’elles fussent, j’entendais quelquefois Mme Swann me parler de sa fille. Je commençais du reste à y trouver tel ou tel plaisir où Gilberte n’était pour rien.","Besides, little by little each refusal to see her pained me less. And as it became less dear to me, my painful memories no longer had enough force to destroy in their incessant return the formation of the pleasure I had in thinking of Florence, of Venice. I regretted at those times having given up entering into diplomacy and having made a sedentary existence for myself so as not to distance myself from a young girl whom I would no longer see and whom I had already almost forgotten. We build our life for a person and, when finally we can receive it, this person does not come, then dies for you and we live prisoner in what was intended only for him. If Venice seemed to my parents very distant and very feverish for me, it was at least easy to go without fatigue to settle in Balbec. But for that I would have had to leave Paris, give up those visits, thanks to which, rare as they were, I sometimes heard Madame Swann talk to me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in it such and such a pleasure where Gilberte had nothing to do with it.","But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to go, without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part.","Gradually, the more often I declined her suggestion that we meet, the less pain it caused me. As she became slowly less dear to me, my hurtful and incessantly recurring memories of her lost the power to prevent the thought of a visit to Florence or Venice from giving me pleasure. At such moments, I regretted the fact that I had turned down the diplomatic career and tied myself to a life without travel, so as not to absent myself from a girl whom I would not now be seeing again, whom I had already more or less forgotten. We design our life for the sake of an individual who, by the time we are able to welcome her into it, has turned into a total stranger, and never comes to share that life with us; and so we live on imprisoned in an arrangement made for someone else. Though my parents judged Venice to be too distant and fever-ridden for me, at least it was easy and untiring to go for a time to Balbec. But that would have entailed leaving Paris and giving up my visits, infrequent though they were, to Mme Swann’s, where I could hear her speak about her daughter, and where I was even beginning to discover other pleasures, which had nothing to do with Gilberte."
"Quand Swann m’avait dit à Paris, un jour que j’étais particulièrement souffrant : « Vous devriez partir pour ces délicieuses îles de l’Océanie, vous verrez que vous n’en reviendrez plus », j’aurais voulu lui répondre : « Mais alors je ne verrai plus votre fille, je vivrai au milieu de choses et de gens qu’elle n’a jamais vus. » Et pourtant ma raison me disait : « Qu’est-ce que cela peut faire, puisque tu n’en seras pas affligé ? Quand Monsieur Swann te dit que tu ne reviendras pas, il entend par là que tu ne voudras pas revenir, et puisque tu ne le voudras pas, c’est que, là-bas, tu seras heureux. » Car ma raison savait que l’habitude – l’habitude qui allait assumer maintenant l’entreprise de me faire aimer ce logis inconnu, de changer da place la glace, la nuance des rideaux, d’arrêter la pendule – se charge aussi bien de nous rendre chers les compagnons qui nous avaient déplu d’abord, de donner une autre forme aux visages, de rendre sympathique le son d’une voix, de modifier l’inclination des cœurs. Certes ces amitiés nouvelles pour des lieux et des gens ont pour trame l’oubli des anciennes ; mais justement ma raison pensait que je pouvais envisager sans terreur la perspective d’une vie où je serais à jamais séparé d’êtres dont je perdrais le souvenir, et c’est comme une consolation qu’elle offrait à mon cœur une promesse d’oubli qui ne faisait au contraire qu’affoler son désespoir. Ce n’est pas que notre cœur ne doive éprouver lui aussi, quand la séparation sera consommée, les effets analgésiques de l’habitude ; mais jusque-là il continuera de souffrir. Et la crainte d’un avenir où nous serons enlevés la vue et l’entretien de ceux que nous aimons et d’où nous tirons aujourd’hui notre plus chère joie, cette crainte, loin de se dissiper, s’accroît, si à la douleur d’une telle privation nous pensons que s’ajoutera ce qui pour nous semble actuellement plus cruel encore : ne pas la ressentir comme une douleur, y rester indifférent ; car alors notre moi serait changé, ce ne serait plus seulement le charme de nos parents, de notre maîtresse, de nos amis, qui ne serait plus autour de nous, mais notre affection pour eux ; elle aurait été si parfaitement arrachée de notre cœur dont elle est aujourd’hui une notable part, que nous pourrions nous plaire à cette vie séparée d’eux dont la pensée nous fait horreur aujourd’hui ; ce serait donc une vraie mort de nous-même, mort suivie, il est vrai, de résurrection, mais en un moi différent et jusqu’à l’amour duquel ne peuvent s’élever les parties de l’ancien moi condamnées à mourir. Ce sont elles – même les plus chétives, comme les obscurs attachements aux dimensions, à l’atmosphère d’une chambre – qui s’effarent et refusent, en des rébellions où il faut voir un mode secret, partiel, tangible et vrai de la résistance à la mort, de la longue résistance désespérée et quotidienne à la mort fragmentaire et successive telle qu’elle s’insère dans toute la durée de notre vie, détachant de nous à chaque moment des lambeaux de nous-même sur la mortification desquels des cellules nouvelles multiplieront. Et pour une nature nerveuse comme était la mienne, c’est-à-dire chez qui les intermédiaires, les nerfs, remplissent mal leurs fonctions, n’arrêtent pas dans sa route vers la conscience, mais y laissent au contraire parvenir, distincte, épuisante, innombrable et douloureuse, la plainte des plus humbles éléments du moi qui vont disparaître, l’anxieuse alarme que j’éprouvais sous ce plafond inconnu et trop haut n’était que la protestation d’une amitié qui survivait en moi pour un plafond familier et bas. Sans doute cette amitié disparaîtrait, une autre ayant pris sa place (alors la mort, puis une nouvelle vie auraient, sous le nom d’Habitude, accompli leur œuvre double) ; mais jusqu’à son anéantissement, chaque soir elle souffrirait, et ce premier soir-là surtout, mise en présence d’un avenir déjà réalisé où il n’y avait plus de place pour elle, elle se révoltait, elle me torturait du cri de ses lamentations chaque fois que mes regards, ne pouvant se détourner de ce qui les blessait, essayaient de se poser au plafond inaccessible.","When Swann had said to me in Paris, one day when I was particularly ill: ""You should leave for these delicious islands of Oceania, you will see that you will never come back"", I would have liked to answer him: "" But then I will no longer see your daughter, I will live among things and people she has never seen. And yet my reason said to me: “What can it matter, since you will not be distressed by it? When Monsieur Swann tells you that you won't come back, he means by that that you won't want to come back, and since you won't, it's because, over there, you'll be happy. For my reason knew that the habit – the habit which was now going to assume the task of making me love this unknown dwelling, of changing the place of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, of stopping the clock – to endear to us the companions who had displeased us at first, to give another form to faces, to render sympathetic the sound of a voice, to modify the inclination of hearts. Admittedly, these new friendships for places and people are based on forgetting old ones; but precisely my reason thought that I could contemplate without terror the prospect of a life where I would be forever separated from beings whose memory I would lose, and it was like a consolation that it offered to my heart a promise of oblivion which, on the contrary, only maddened his despair. It is not that our heart must also experience, when the separation is consummated, the analgesic effects of habit; but until then he will continue to suffer. And the fear of a future in which we shall be taken from the sight and support of those we love and from which we now derive our dearest joy, this fear, far from dissipating, increases, if at the pain of such deprivation, we believe, will be added to what currently seems even more cruel to us: not feeling it as pain, remaining indifferent to it; for then our ego would be changed, it would no longer be only the charm of our parents, of our mistress, of our friends, which would no longer be around us, but our affection for them; it would have been so perfectly torn from our hearts, of which it is today a notable part, that we could enjoy this life separated from them, the thought of which horrifies us today; it would therefore be a real death of ourselves, death followed, it is true, by resurrection, but in a different self and up to the love of which the parts of the old self condemned to die cannot rise. It is they – even the most puny ones, like the obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a room – which take fright and refuse, in rebellions where one must see a secret, partial, tangible and true mode of resistance to death, from the long desperate and daily resistance to fragmentary and successive death such as it is inserted in the whole duration of our life, detaching from us at each moment shreds of ourselves on the mortification of which new cells will multiply. And for a nervous nature like mine, that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, poorly fulfill their functions, do not stop in its path towards consciousness, but on the contrary allow it to reach it, distinct, exhausting, innumerable and painful, the complaint of the most humble elements of me which will disappear, the anxious alarm which I felt under this unknown and too high ceiling was only the protest of a friendship which survived in me for a ceiling familiar and low. No doubt this friendship would disappear, another having taken its place (then death, then a new life would, under the name of Habit, have accomplished their double work); but until her annihilation, each evening she would suffer, and that first evening especially, placed in the presence of a future already realized where there was no longer any place for her, she revolted, she tortured me with her cry of his lamentations each time my eyes, unable to turn away from what hurt them, tried to land on the inaccessible ceiling.","When Swann had said to me, in Paris one day when I felt particularly unwell: ""You ought to go off to one of those glorious islands in the Pacific; you'd never come back again if you did. "" I should have liked to answer: ""But then I shall not see your daughter any more; I shall be living among people and things she has never seen."" And yet my better judgment whispered: ""What difference can that make, since you are not going to be affected by it? When M. Swann tells you that you will not come back he means by that that you will not want to come back, and if you don't want to that is because you will be happier out there. "" For my judgment was aware that Habit—Habit which was even now setting to work to make me like this unfamiliar lodging, to change the position of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, to stop the clock—undertakes as well to make dear to us the companions whom at first we disliked, to give another appearance to their faces, to make attractive the sound of their voices, to modify the inclinations of their hearts. It is true that these new friendships for places and people are based upon forgetfulness of the old; but what my better judgment was thinking was simply that I could look without apprehension along the vista of a life in which I should be for ever separated from people all memory of whom I should lose, and it was by way of consolation that my mind was offering to my heart a promise of oblivion which succeeded only in sharpening the edge of its despair. Not that the heart also is not bound in time, when separation is complete, to feel the anodyne effect of habit; but until then it will continue to suffer. And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive to–day our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all—to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, pur mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which to–day it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which to–day makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die. It is they—even the meanest of them, such as our obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a bedroom—that grow stubborn and refuse, in acts of rebellion which we must recognise to be a secret, partial, tangible and true aspect of our resistance to death, of the long resistance, desperate and daily renewed, to a fragmentary and gradual death such as interpolates itself throughout the whole course of our life, tearing away from us at every moment a shred of ourselves, dead matter on which new cells will multiply, and grow. And for a neurotic nature such as mine, one that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, perform their functions badly—fail to arrest on its way to the consciousness, allow indeed to penetrate there, distinct, exhausting, innumerable, agonising, the plaint of those most humble elements of the personality which are about to disappear—the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too lofty ceiling were but the protest of an affection that survived in me for a ceiling that was familiar and low. Doubtless this affection too would disappear, and another have taken its place (when death, and then another life, would, in the guise of Habit, have performed their double task); but until its annihilation, every night it would suffer afresh, and on this first night especially, confronted with a future already realised in which there would no longer be any place for it, it rose in revolt, it tortured me with the sharp sound of its lamentations whenever my straining eyes, powerless to turn from what was wounding them, endeavoured to fasten their gaze upon that inaccessible ceiling.","One day in Paris when I had been feeling particularly unwell, Swann had said, ‘What you should do is be off to the South Seas, the islands … You’d very likely never come back.’ I almost answered, ‘But that would mean I’d never see your daughter again – I would live among things and people she would never have set eyes on!’ But at the same moment, reason was murmuring: ‘Well, what difference will that make, since I won’t be upset about it? When M. Swann says I very likely won’t ever come back, what he means is I won’t want to come back, and if I don’t want to come back, that will be because I’ll be perfectly happy to stay there.’ Reason was aware that habit (which was going to set about making me like these unknown quarters, change the position of the cheval-glass, tone down the curtains, silence the clock) also undertakes to endear to us people whom we disliked to begin with, alters the shape of their face, improves their tone of voice, makes hearts grow fonder. This liking for new places and people is of course worked into our forgetting of older ones; but reason suspected I could foresee without qualms a life without certain people, who would even fade for ever from my memory, and so the promise of forgetting which it held out, though intended as a consolation, was heart-breaking. Not that the heart does not also benefit, once such a divorce is consummated, from the analgesia of habit; but until that time comes, it goes on suffering without let-up. The fear of a future deprived of the faces and voices of those we love, those who today give us our dearest happiness, rather than diminishing, may in fact be made worse by the thought that the pain of that deprivation is to be compounded by something which at the moment seems even more unbearable: our no longer being affected by it as a pain, but being indifferent to it; for that would mean our actual self had changed, and not just that we had lost the delight in our parents’ presence, the charm of a mistress, the warmth of a friend; it would mean that our affection for them had been so utterly obliterated from our heart, of which it is an integral part today, that we would be able to take pleasure in a life spent without them, horrible though that seems at present; it would amount to a death of our self, albeit followed by a resurrection, but a resurrection in the form of a different self, whose love will remain for ever beyond the reach of those parts of the former self which have gone down to death. It is those parts of us, even the most insubstantial and obscure of them, such as our attachment to the dimensions or the atmosphere of a particular room, which take fright, withhold consent and engage in rebellions which must be seen as a covert and partial yet tangible and true mode of resistance to death, that lengthy, desperate, daily resistance to the sporadic but non-stop dying which attends us throughout our lives, stripping off bits of us at every moment, which have no sooner mortified than new cells begin to grow. For a nervous disposition such as mine (that is, one in which the functioning of the intermediaries, the nerves, is impaired, so that they fail to stifle the voice of the lowliest elements of self doomed to decease, and their harrowing many-headed lament, in all its sorrow, rises unmuted to the wearied ears of consciousness) the anguish and alarm I felt when lying beneath a ceiling that was unknown and too high was nothing but the protest of my surviving attachment to a ceiling which was known and lower. No doubt that attachment would end and be replaced by another: first death, then a new life, would have done their dual work at the behest of Habit. But until that end, this attachment would suffer every evening; and on that first evening especially, in revolt at being confronted with a future which had already taken shape, in which there was no role for it, it tortured me with the din of its wailing every time my eyes, unable to look away from what affronted them, tried to reach that inaccessible ceiling."
"Bientôt les jours diminuèrent et au moment où j’entrais dans la chambre, le ciel violet semblait stigmatisé par la figure raide, géométrique, passagère et fulgurante du soleil (pareille à la représentation de quelque signe miraculeux, de quelque apparition mystique), s’inclinait vers la mer sur la charnière de l’horizon comme un tableau religieux au-dessus du maître-autel, tandis que les parties différentes du couchant exposées dans les glaces des bibliothèques basses en acajou qui couraient le long des murs et que je rapportais par la pensée à la merveilleuse peinture dont elles étaient détachées semblaient comme ces scènes différentes que quelque maître ancien exécuta jadis pour une confrérie sur une châsse, et dont on exhibe à côté les uns des autres dans une salle de musée les volets séparés que l’imagination seule du visiteur remet à leur place sur les prédelles du retable. Quelques semaines plus tard, quand je remontais, le soleil était déjà couché. Pareille à celle que je voyais à Combray au-dessus du Calvaire à mes retours de promenade et quand je m’apprêtais à descendre avant le dîner à la cuisine, une bande de ciel rouge au-dessus de la mer compacte et coupante comme de la gelée de viande, puis bientôt, sur la mer déjà froide et bleue comme le poisson appelé mulet, le ciel, du même rose qu’un de ces saumons que nous nous ferions servir tout à l’heure à Rivebelle, ravivaient le plaisir que j’allais avoir à me mettre en habit pour partir dîner. Sur la mer, tout près du rivage, essayaient de s’élever, les unes par-dessus les autres, à étages de plus en plus larges, des vapeurs d’un noir de suie mais aussi d’un poli, d’une consistance d’agate, d’une pesanteur visible, si bien que les plus élevées penchant au-dessus de la tige déformée et jusqu’en dehors du centre de gravité de celles qui les avaient soutenues jusqu’ici, semblaient sur le point d’entraîner cet échafaudage déjà à demi hauteur du ciel et de le précipiter dans la mer. La vue d’un vaisseau qui s’éloignait comme un voyageur de nuit me donnait cette même impression que j’avais eue en wagon, d’être affranchi des nécessités du sommeil et de la claustration dans une chambre. D’ailleurs je ne me sentais pas emprisonné dans celle où j’étais puisque dans une heure j’allais la quitter pour monter en voiture. Je me jetais sur mon lit ; et, comme si j’avais été sur la couchette d’un des bateaux que je voyais assez près de moi et que la nuit on s’étonnerait de voir se déplacer lentement dans l’obscurité, comme des cygnes assombris et silencieux mais qui ne dorment pas, j’étais de tous côtés entouré des images de la mer.","Soon the days diminished and as I entered the room, the violet sky seemed branded by the stiff, geometrical, fleeting and dazzling figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition), tilted towards the sea on the hinge of the horizon like a religious painting above the high altar, while the different parts of the west exposed in the mirrors of the low mahogany bookcases which ran along the walls and which I brought back by the thought of the marvelous painting from which they were detached seemed like those different scenes which some old master once executed for a brotherhood on a reliquary, and of which one exhibits side by side in a museum hall the separate shutters which the imagination only the visitor puts them back in their place on the predellas of the altarpiece. A few weeks later, when I came back up, the sun had already set. Like the one I saw at Combray above Calvaire when I returned from my walks and when I was about to go down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky above the sea, compact and sharp as meat jelly, then soon, over the sea already cold and blue like the fish called a mullet, the sky, the same pink as one of those salmons that we would have served to us just now at Rivebelle, revived the pleasure that I I was going to have to put on my clothes to go out to dinner. On the sea, very close to the shore, trying to rise, one above the other, in ever larger tiers, vapors of a soot black but also of a polish, of a consistency of agate, of a visible heaviness, so that the upper ones leaning above the deformed stem and even outside the center of gravity of those which had hitherto supported them, seemed about to draw this scaffolding already halfway up the sky and throwing it into the sea. The sight of a ship moving away like a night traveler gave me the same impression that I had sleep and confinement in a room. Besides, I did not feel imprisoned in the one where I was since in an hour I was going to leave it to get into the car. I threw myself on my bed; and, as if I had been on the berth of one of the boats which I saw fairly close to me and which at night one would be surprised to see moving slowly in the darkness, like swans darkened and silent but which do not not sleep, I was surrounded on all sides by images of the sea.","Presently the days grew shorter and at the moment when I entered my room the violet sky seemed branded with the stiff, geometrical, travelling, effulgent figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition) leaning over the sea from the hinge of the horizon as a sacred picture leans over a high altar, while the different parts of the western sky exposed in the glass fronts of the low mahogany bookcases that ran along the walls, which I carried back in my mind to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, seemed like those different scenes which some old master executed long ago for a. confraternity upon a shrine, whose separate panels are now exhibited side by side upon the wall of a museum gallery, so that the visitor's imagination alone can restore them to their place on the predella of the reredos. A few weeks later, when I went upstairs, the sun had already set. Like the one that I used to see at Combray, behind the Calvary, when I was coming home from a walk and looking forward to going down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky over the sea, compact and clear–cut as a layer of aspic over meat, then, a little later, over a sea already cold and blue like a grey mullet, a sky of the same pink as the salmon that we should presently be ordering at Rivebelle reawakened the pleasure which I was to derive from the act of dressing to go out to dinner. Over the sea, quite near the shore, were trying to rise, one beyond another, at wider and wider intervals, vapours of a pitchy blackness but also of the polish and consistency of agate, of a visible weight, so much so that the highest among them, poised at the end of their contorted stem and overreaching the centre of gravity of the pile that had hitherto supported them, seemed on the point of bringing down in ruin this lofty structure already half the height of the sky, and of precipitating it into the sea. The sight of a ship that was moving away like a nocturnal traveller gave me the same impression that I had had in the train of being set free from the necessity of sleep and from confinement in a bedroom. Not that I felt myself a prisoner in the room in which I now was, since in another hour I should have left it and be getting into the carriage. I threw myself down on the bed; and, just as if I had been lying in a berth on board one of those steamers which I could see quite near to me and which, when night came, it would be strange to see stealing slowly out into the darkness, like shadowy and silent but unsleeping swans, I was on all sides surrounded by pictures of the sea.","Then the days grew shorter; and when I went to my room, the violet sky, which seemed to have been branded by the rigid, geometrical, fleeting, flashing iron of the sun (as though in representation of some miraculous sign or mystical apparition), hung down over the sea at the juncture of the horizon like a religious canvas above a high altar, while the different parts of the sunset, exhibited in the glass-doors of the low mahogany book-cases running round the walls, and which I mentally compared to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, were like the different scenes with which an old master once decorated a shrine for a religious house, now divided into separate panels, for display in a museum, where only the imagination of a visitor to the exhibition can reassemble them on the predellas of the altar-piece. Some weeks later, when I went up, the sun would have already set. Lying above the sea, there would be a band of red, as dense and fine-edged as a slab of aspic, similar to the red striping the sky at Combray, above the wayside cross, on evenings when I was nearing home after a walk and intended to go down to the kitchen before dinner; and before long, right on top of the water, which had the coldness and the colour of the fish known as grey mullet, there would be another sky, of the same pink as one of the salmon we would soon order at Rivebelle; and these shades whetted my expectation of the pleasure of changing into evening clothes to go out to dine. Very close to the shore, trying to rise over the sea, in storeys which spread ever wider, its layers superimposed upon one another, there was a haze as black as soot, but also with the smooth sheen and consistency of agate, its highest parts, visibly top-heavy, beginning to tilt above their deformed support, leaning away from the centre of gravity of those which had underpinned them hitherto, and seeming about to crumble and collapse into the sea, dragging down with them from half-way up the sky the whole precarious edifice. The sight of a ship leaving, like a night traveller, gave me the impression I had once had in the train, of being freed of the restrictions of sleeping and staying closed up in a room. Not that I felt hemmed in by this room, since within the hour I was going to walk out of it and go off in a carriage. I lay down on the bed; and, as though I were on a bunk, aboard one of the boats which I could see not far away, and which after nightfall people might be surprised to see moving slowly through the darkness, like dim, silent swans that never sleep, I was surrounded on all sides by images of the sea."

"Pensant que si je connaissais leurs amis j’aurais plus d’occasions de voir ces jeunes filles, j’avais été sur le point de lui demander à être présenté. Je le dis à Albertine, dès qu’il fut parti en répétant : « Je suis dans les choux. » Je pensais lui inculquer ainsi l’idée de le faire la prochaine fois. « Mais voyons, s’écria-t-elle, je ne peux pas vous présenter à un gigolo ! Ici ça pullule de gigolos. Mais ils ne pourraient pas causer avec vous. Celui-ci joue très bien au golf, un point c’est tout. Je m’y connais, il ne serait pas du tout votre genre. – Vos amies vont se plaindre si vous les laissez ainsi, lui dis-je, espérant qu’elle allait me proposer d’aller avec elle les rejoindre. – Mais non, elles n’ont aucun besoin de moi ». Nous croisâmes Bloch qui m’adressa un sourire fin et insinuant, et, embarrassé au sujet d’Albertine qu’il ne connaissait pas ou du moins connaissait « sans la connaître », abaissa sa tête vers son col d’un mouvement raide et rébarbatif. « Comment s’appelle-t-il, cet ostrogoth-là, me demanda Albertine. Je ne sais pas pourquoi il me salue puisqu’il ne me connaît pas. Aussi je ne lui ai pas rendu son salut. » Je n’eus pas le temps de répondre à Albertine, car marchant droit sur nous : « Excuse-moi, dit-il, de t’interrompre, mais je voulais t’avertir que je vais demain à Doncières. Je ne peux plus attendre sans impolitesse et je me demande ce que Saint-Loup-en-bray doit penser de moi. Je te préviens que je prends le train de deux heures. À ta disposition. » Mais je ne pensais plus qu’à revoir Albertine et à tâcher de connaître ses amies, et Doncières, comme elles n’y allaient pas et que je rentrerais après l’heure où elles allaient sur la plage, me paraissait au bout du monde. Je dis à Bloch que cela m’était impossible. « Hé bien, j’irai seul. Selon les deux ridicules alexandrins du sieur Arouet, je dirai à Saint-Loup, pour charmer son cléricalisme : « Apprends que mon devoir ne dépend pas du sien, qu’il y manque s’il veut, je dois faire le mien. » – Je reconnais qu’il est assez joli garçon, me dit Albertine, mais ce qu’il me dégoûte ! » Je n’avais jamais songé que Bloch pût être joli garçon ; il l’était, en effet. Avec une tête un peu proéminente, un nez très busqué, un air d’extrême finesse et d’être persuadé de sa finesse, il avait un visage agréable. Mais il ne pouvait pas plaire à Albertine. C’était peut-être du reste à cause des mauvais côtés de celle-ci, de la dureté, de l’insensibilité de la petite bande, de sa grossièreté avec tout ce qui n’était pas elle. D’ailleurs plus tard quand je les présentai, l’antipathie d’Albertine ne diminua pas. Bloch appartenait à un milieu où, entre la blague exercée contre le monde et pourtant le respect suffisant des bonnes manières que doit avoir un homme qui a « les mains propres », on a fait une sorte de compromis spécial qui diffère des manières du monde et est malgré tout une sorte particulièrement odieuse de mondanité. Quand on le présentait, il s’inclinait à la fois avec un sourire de scepticisme et un respect exagéré, et si c’était à un homme disait : « Enchanté, Monsieur », d’une voix qui se moquait des mots qu’elle prononçait, mais avait conscience d’appartenir à quelqu’un qui n’était pas un mufle. Cette première seconde donnée à une coutume qu’il suivait et raillait à la fois (comme il disait le premier janvier : « Je vous la souhaite bonne et heureuse »), il prenait un air fin et rusé et « proférait des choses subtiles » qui étaient souvent pleines de vérité mais « tapaient sur les nerfs » d’Albertine. Quand je lui dis ce premier jour qu’il s’appelait Bloch, elle s’écria : « Je l’aurais parié que c’était un youpin. C’est bien leur genre de faire les punaises. » Du reste, Bloch devait dans la suite irriter Albertine d’autre façon. Comme beaucoup d’intellectuels, il ne pouvait pas dire simplement les choses simples. Il trouvait pour chacune d’elles un qualificatif précieux, puis généralisait. Cela ennuyait Albertine, laquelle n’aimait pas beaucoup qu’on s’occupât de ce qu’elle faisait, que quand elle s’était foulé le pied et restait tranquille, Bloch dît : « Elle est sur sa chaise longue, mais par ubiquité ne cesse pas de fréquenter simultanément de vagues golfs et de quelconques tennis. » Ce n’était que de la « littérature », mais qui, à cause des difficultés qu’Albertine sentait que cela pouvait lui créer avec des gens chez qui elle avait refusé une invitation en disant qu’elle ne pouvait pas remuer, eût suffi pour lui faire prendre en grippe la figure, le son de la voix, du garçon qui disait ces choses. Nous nous quittâmes, Albertine et moi, en nous promettant de sortir une fois ensemble. J’avais causé avec elle sans plus savoir où tombaient mes paroles, ce qu’elles devenaient, que si j’eusse jeté des cailloux dans un abîme sans fond. Qu’elles soient remplies en général par la personne à qui nous les adressons d’un sens qu’elle tire de sa propre substance et qui est très différent de celui que nous avions mis dans ces mêmes paroles, c’est un fait que la vie courante nous révèle perpétuellement. Mais si de plus nous nous trouvons auprès d’une personne dont l’éducation (comme pour moi celle d’Albertine) nous est inconcevable, inconnus les penchants, les lectures, les principes, nous ne savons pas si nos paroles éveillent en elle quelque chose qui y ressemble plus que chez un animal à qui pourtant on aurait à faire comprendre certaines choses. De sorte qu’essayer de me lier avec Albertine m’apparaissait comme une mise en contact avec l’inconnu sinon avec l’impossible, comme un exercice aussi malaisé que dresser un cheval, aussi reposant qu’élever des abeilles ou que cultiver des rosiers.","Thinking that if I knew their friends I would have more opportunities to see these young girls, I had been about to ask him to be introduced. I told Albertine as soon as he had left, repeating: ""I'm in trouble."" I thought I would instill in him the idea of doing it next time. ""Come now,"" she cried, ""I can't introduce you to a gigolo!"" Here it abounds with gigolos. But they couldn't talk to you. This one plays golf very well, period. I know about it, he wouldn't be your type at all. ""Your friends are going to complain if you leave them like that,"" I told her, hoping she'd ask me to go with her. ""No, no, they don't need me."" We passed Bloch, who gave me a delicate and insinuating smile, and, embarrassed about Albertine whom he did not know or at least knew ""without knowing her"", lowered his head towards his collar with a stiff and forbidding movement. . “What is his name, that Ostrogoth?” Albertine asked me. I don't know why he greets me since he doesn't know me. So I didn't return his greeting. I didn't have time to answer Albertine, for walking straight towards us: ""Excuse me,"" he said, ""for interrupting you, but I wanted to let you know that I'm going to Doncières tomorrow."" I can't wait any longer without being rude and I wonder what Saint-Loup-en-Bray must think of me. I warn you that I am taking the two o'clock train. At your disposal. But all I thought about was seeing Albertine again and trying to get to know her friends, and Doncières, as they weren't going there and I would be back after the time they went to the beach, seemed to me to be at the end of the world. . I told Bloch that was impossible for me. ""Well, I'll go alone. According to the two ridiculous Alexandrians of Sieur Arouet, I will say to Saint-Loup, to charm his clericalism: “Learn that my duty does not depend on his, that he fails in it if he wants, I must do mine. “I recognize that he is quite a pretty fellow,” said Albertine to me, “but how disgusting he is! I had never dreamed that Bloch could be a pretty boy; he was, indeed. With a somewhat prominent head, a very hooked nose, an air of extreme delicacy and being convinced of his delicacy, he had a pleasant face. But he could not please Albertine. It was perhaps because of the bad sides of this one, the harshness, the insensitivity of the little band, its rudeness with everything that was not it. Besides, later when I introduced them, Albertine's antipathy did not diminish. Bloch belonged to a milieu where, between the joke exercised against the world and yet the sufficient respect for the good manners that a man with ""clean hands"" must have, a kind of special compromise was made which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a particularly odious kind of worldliness. When introduced, he bowed both with a smile of skepticism and exaggerated respect, and if it was to a man, he would say: ""Delighted, sir,"" in a voice that mocked the words she was saying. pronounced, but was aware of belonging to someone who was not a boor. This first second given to a custom that he both followed and mocked (as he said on January 1: ""I wish you good and happy days""), he assumed a shrewd air and ""uttered subtle things"" that were often full of truth but ""got on Albertine's nerves"". When I told her that first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: “I would have bet him it was a Yid. It's their kind of thing to be thumbtacks. Besides, Bloch was later to irritate Albertine in other ways. Like many intellectuals, he could not just say the simple things. He found for each of them a valuable qualifier, then generalized. It bothered Albertine, who didn't much like people bothering about what she was doing, that when she had sprained her foot and remained quiet, Bloch would say: ""She's on her chaise-longue, but out of ubiquity."" does not stop simultaneously frequenting vague golf courses and some tennis courts. It was only ""literature,"" but which, because of the difficulties Albertine felt it might create for her with people to whom she had refused an invitation saying that she could not move, would have sufficed. to make him dislike the face, the sound of the voice, of the boy who said these things. We parted, Albertine and I, promising to go out together once. I had talked to her without knowing where my words fell, what they became, than if I had thrown pebbles into a bottomless abyss. That they are generally filled by the person to whom we address them with a meaning which he derives from his own substance and which is very different from that which we had put into these same words, it is a fact that the daily life constantly reveals to us. But if, moreover, we find ourselves with a person whose education (as for me that of Albertine) is inconceivable to us, unknown inclinations, readings, principles, we do not know if our words awaken in her something something that resembles it more than in an animal to which, however, one would have to make certain things understand. So that trying to bond with Albertine seemed to me like putting me in contact with the unknown if not with the impossible, like an exercise as difficult as training a horse, as restful as raising bees or cultivating roses. .","Supposing that if I knew their male friends I should have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been on the point of asking for an introduction to Octave. I told Albertine this, as soon as he had left us, still muttering, ""I couldn't play for nuts!"" I thought I would thus put into her head the idea of doing it next time. "" But I can't,"" she cried, ""introduce you to a tame cat like that. This place simply swarms with them. But what on earth would they have to say to you? That one plays golf quite well, and that's all there is to it. I know what I'm talking about; you'd find he wasn't at all your sort."" ""Your friends will be cross with you if you desert them like this,"" I repeated, hoping that she would then suggest my joining the party. "" Oh, no, they don't want me. "" We ran into Bloch, who directed at me a subtle, insinuating smile, and, embarrassed by the presence of Albertine, whom he did not know, or, rather, knew 'without knowing' her, bent his head with a stiff, almost irritated jerk. ""What's he called, that Ostrogoth?"" Albertine asked. ""I can't think why he should bow to me; he doesn't know me. And I didn't bow to him, either. "" I had no time to explain to her, for, bearing straight down upon us, ""Excuse me,"" he began, ""for interrupting you, but I must tell you that I am going to Doncières to–morrow. I cannot put it off any longer without discourtesy; indeed, I ask myself, what must de Saint–Loup–en– Bray think of me. I just came to let you know that I shall take the two o'clock train. At your service. "" But I thought now only of seeing Albertine again, and of trying to get to know her friends, and Doncières, since they were not going there, and my going would bring me back too late to see them still on the beach, seemed to me to be situated at the other end of the world. I told Bloch that it was impossible. "" Oh, very well, I shall go alone. In the fatuous words of Master Arouet, I shall say to Saint–Loup, to beguile his clericalism: 'My duty stands alone, by his in no way bound; Though he should choose to fail, yet faithful I'll be found.'"" ""I admit he's not a bad looking boy,"" was Albertine's comment, ""but he makes me feel quite sick. "" I had never thought that Bloch might be 'not a bad looking boy'; and yet, when one came to think of it, so he was. With his rather prominent brow, very aquiline nose, and his air of extreme cleverness and of being convinced of his cleverness, he had a pleasing face. But he could not succeed in pleasing Albertine. This was perhaps due, to some extent, to her own disadvantages, the harshness, the want of feeling of the little band, its rudeness towards everything that was not itself. And later on, when I introduced them, Albertine's antipathy for him grew no less. Bloch belonged to a section of society in which, between the free and easy customs of the 'smart set' and the regard for good manners which a man is supposed to shew who 'does not soil his hands,' a sort of special compromise has been reached which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a peculiarly unpleasant form of worldliness. When he was introduced to anyone he would bow with a sceptical smile, and at the same time with an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it was to a man, would say: ""Pleased to meet you, sir,"" in a voice which ridiculed the words that it was uttering, though with a consciousness of belonging to some one who was no fool. Having sacrificed this first moment to a custom which he at once followed and derided (just as on the first of January he would greet you with a 'Many happy!') he would adopt an air of infinite cunning, and would 'proffer subtle words' which were often true enough but 'got on' Albertine's nerves. When I told her on this first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: ""I would have betted anything he was a Jew–boy. Trust them to put their foot in it!"" Moreover, Bloch was destined to give Albertine other grounds for annoyance later on. Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way. He would find some precious qualification for every statement, and would sweep from particular to general. It vexed Albertine, who was never too well pleased at other people's shewing an interest in what she was doing, that when she had sprained her ankle and was keeping quiet, Bloch said of her: ""She is outstretched on her chair, but in her ubiquity has not ceased to frequent simultaneously vague golf–courses and dubious tennis–courts."" He was simply being 'literary,' of course, but this, in view of the difficulties which Albertine felt that it might create for her with friends whose invitations she had declined on the plea that she was unable to move, was quite enough to disgust her with the face, the sound of the voice, of the young man who could say such things about her. We parted, Albertine and I, after promising to take a walk together later. I had talked to her without being any more conscious of where my words were falling, of what became of them, than if I were dropping pebbles into a bottomless pit. That our words are, as a general rule, filled, by the person to whom we address them, with a meaning which that person derives from her own substance, a meaning widely different from that which we had put into the same words when we uttered them, is a fact which the daily round of life is perpetually demonstrating. But if we find ourselves as well in the company of a person whose education (as Albertine's was to me) is inconceivable, her tastes, her reading, her principles unknown, we cannot tell whether our words have aroused in her anything that resembles their meaning, any more than in an animal, although there are things that even an animal may be made to understand. So that to attempt any closer friendship with Albertine seemed to me like placing myself in contact with the unknown, if not the impossible, an occupation as arduous as breaking a horse, as reposeful as keeping bees or growing roses.","Thinking that, if I knew their friends, I might have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been about to ask Albertine to introduce me to him. As soon as he had walked away, repeating, ‘I’m just an also-ran,’ I said so to her, with the idea that this might inspire her to introduce us on the next occasion. ‘ Oh, goodness! she said. I couldn’t introduce you to a lounge lizard! The place is crawling with them! But they’d be incapable of conversing with you. He’s good at golf and that’s all he’s good at. Believe me, he wouldn’t be your type at all. – Your friends will feel neglected if you stay away from them like this, I said, hoping she would suggest we go and meet them together. – Not at all, they don’t need me.’ We soon came upon Bloch: he gave me a shrewd and meaning smile; then, in some perplexity towards Albertine, whom he did not know, or rather whom he did know but ‘without being acquainted with her’, with a stiff, uncouth movement, he gave a nod. ‘ Who’s that savage? she asked. I can’t think why he’s nodding at me – he doesn’t know me. I’ll ignore him.’ I had no time to reply, as Bloch came straight over and said to me, ‘Excuse me for interrupting, but I just wanted to let you know I’m going over to Doncières tomorrow. It would be impolite of me to leave it any longer and I don’t know what Saint-Loup-en-Bray must think of me. So I’m letting you know that I’ll be taking the two o’clock. It’s up to you.’ However, I had no thoughts for anything but Albertine and the need to meet her girl-friends. Hence, a visit to Doncières, where they never went, which would get me back to Balbec long after their time for appearing on the beach, seemed like a trip to the end of the earth. So I told Bloch I could not go. ‘ In that case, I’ll go by myself. And to charm Saint-Loup-en-Bray’s clericalism, I shall speak to him of you with the ridiculous couplet of Master Arouet: Apprends que mon devoir ne dépend point du sien; Qu’il y manque, s’il veut; je dois faire le mien.94 – I can see he’s really quite handsome, Albertine said. But I must say I don’t like him at all!’ It had never occurred to me that Bloch might be ‘quite handsome’. But he was: with his slightly protruding forehead, his pronounced Roman nose, his look of being extremely astute (and of believing he was extremely astute), he had a very pleasant face. Even so, he was not to Albertine’s liking. This may have been explainable by the dislikable sides of her own character, the toughness of the little gang, its insensitivity, its rudeness towards all things outside itself. Later, when I had introduced them, her dislike did not lessen. Bloch belonged to a world which, what with its sneer at good society and yet the tolerance of good manners which a man must retain if he is not to be seen as untouchable, has reached a sort of special compromise by the use of manners which, though not quite those of fashionable society, manage to achieve a peculiar kind of detestable fashionableness. When you introduced him to someone, he would bow with a sceptical smile and an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it were a man whose hand he was shaking, he would say, ‘Charmed to meet you, sir,’ in a voice which mocked the words it spoke, but which knew it did not belong to a boor. Having occupied that second in simultaneously observing and scoffing at a custom (just as he would say, on New Year’s Day, ‘I wish you a Happy New One’), he would then affect an acute and wily expression, and ‘let fall pearls of wisdom’, which I often found full of good sense but which Albertine ‘could not abide’. On that first day, when I told her his name was Bloch, she exclaimed, ‘I wouldn’t have minded betting he was a Jew-boy! They always know how to get your back up!’ At a later stage too, Bloch was to irritate Albertine in another way. Like many intellectuals, he could not say simple things simply. He would describe them with precious epithets, then generalize. Albertine, who disliked it when people paid attention to what she was doing, was annoyed that, when she had sprained her ankle and was resting, Bloch said, ‘She’s lying on her chaise longue. But being gifted with ubiquity, she continues simultaneously to haunt ghostly golf-courses and the tritest of tennis lawns.’ It was merely his ‘stylish’ banter; but to Albertine, who felt it might create difficulties for her with people who had invited her out, and whom she had told she was incapable of moving, it was enough to make her loathe the sight and the sound of the person who said such things. Having agreed to go out together soon, she and I parted. While talking to her, I had been as unaware of my words and where they went as though I had been throwing pebbles into a bottomless well. That in general the people to whom we speak draw from within themselves the meaning they give to our words, and that this meaning is very different from the one we put into them, is a truth constantly revealed to us by everyday life. But if in addition the person to whom we are speaking is, as Albertine was for me, someone whose upbringing is inconceivable, whose inclinations and principles, even the books she reads, are a mystery to us, then we cannot tell whether our words have any more semblance of meaning for her than they would have if we tried to explain ourselves to an animal. Trying to strike up a relationship with Albertine felt like relating to the unknown, or even the impossible, an exercise as difficult as training a horse, as restful95 as keeping bees or growing roses."
"Nous descendîmes sur Hudimesnil ; tout d’un coup je fus rempli de ce bonheur profond que je n’avais pas souvent ressenti depuis Combray, un bonheur analogue à celui que m’avaient donné, entre autres, les clochers de Martainville. Mais cette fois il resta incomplet. Je venais d’apercevoir, en retrait de la route en dos d’âne que nous suivions, trois arbres qui devaient servir d’entrée à une allée couverte et formaient un dessin que je ne voyais pas pour la première fois, je ne pouvais arriver à reconnaître le lieu dont ils étaient comme détachés, mais je sentais qu’il m’avait été familier autrefois ; de sorte que mon esprit ayant trébuché entre quelque année lointaine et le moment présent, les environs de Balbec vacillèrent et je me demandai si toute cette promenade n’était pas une fiction, Balbec un endroit où je n’étais jamais allé que par l’imagination, Mme de Villeparisis un personnage de roman et les trois vieux arbres la réalité qu’on retrouve en levant les yeux de dessus le livre qu’on était en train de lire et qui vous décrivait un milieu dans lequel on avait fini par se croire effectivement transporté.","We descended on Hudimesnil; Suddenly I was filled with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray, a happiness analogous to that which the steeples of Martainville, among others, had given me. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, set back from the humpback road we were following, three trees which were to serve as the entrance to a covered walkway and formed a pattern which I did not see for the first time, I could not arrive to recognize the place from which they were detached, but I felt that it had once been familiar to me; so that my mind having stumbled between some distant year and the present moment, the surroundings of Balbec wavered, and I wondered if all this walk was not a fiction, Balbec a place I had never been except by the imagination, Madame de Villeparisis a character from a novel and the three old trees the reality that we find when we look up from above the book we were reading and which described to you an environment in which we ended up believing ourselves actually transported.","We came down towards Hudimesnil; suddenly I was overwhelmed with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray; happiness analogous to that which had been given me by—among other things—the steeples of Martinville. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, standing a little way back from the steep ridge over which we were passing, three trees, probably marking the entrance to a shady avenue, which made a pattern at which I was looking now not for the first time; I could not succeed in reconstructing the place from which they had been, as it were, detached, but I felt that it had been familiar to me once; so that my mind having wavered between some distant year and the present moment, Balbec and its surroundings began to dissolve and I asked myself whether the whole of this drive were not a make–believe, Balbec a place to which I had never gone save in imagination, Mme. de Villeparisis a character in a story and the three old trees the reality which one recaptures on raising one's eyes from the book which one has been reading and which describes an environment into which one has come to believe that one has been bodily transported.","We drove down towards Hudimesnil, and suddenly I was filled with a feeling of profound bliss, which I associated with Combray but had seldom felt since those days, rather like the feeling I had once had from things such as the steeples of Martinville. This time, however, nothing came of it. It was just three trees which I had noticed, set back a little from the steeply cambered road we were on, looking as though they stood at the entrance to a covered drive, and making a pattern which I knew I had seen somewhere before. I could not manage to recognize the place they had, as it were, been separated from; but I sensed that it must have been somewhere familiar to me, long ago; and as my mind stumbled about between a former year and the present moment, the countryside round Balbec shifted and faltered, and I had to ask myself whether this whole outing was not just some figment, Balbec merely a place where I might once have been in my imagination, Mme de Villeparisis someone out of a novel, and the three old trees nothing but the solid reality that meets the eye of a reader who glances up from a book , his mind still held by the spell of a fictional setting."
"Je rentrai en pensant à cette matinée, en revoyant l’éclair au café que j’avais fini de manger avant de me laisser conduire par Elstir auprès d’Albertine, la rose que j’avais donnée au vieux monsieur, tous ces détails choisis à notre insu par les circonstances et qui composent pour nous, en un arrangement spécial et fortuit, le tableau d’une première rencontre. Mais ce tableau, j’eus l’impression de le voir d’un autre point de vue, de très loin de moi-même, comprenant qu’il n’avait pas existé que pour moi, quand quelques mois plus tard, à mon grand étonnement, comme je parlais à Albertine du premier jour où je l’avais connue, elle me rappela l’éclair, la fleur que j’avais donnée, tout ce que je croyais, je ne peux pas dire n’être important que pour moi, mais n’avoir été aperçu que de moi, que je retrouvais ainsi, transcrit en une version dont je ne soupçonnais l’existence, dans la pensée d’Albertine. Dès ce premier jour, quand en entrant je pus voir le souvenir que je rapportais, je compris quel tour de muscade avait été parfaitement exécuté, et comment j’avais causé un moment avec une personne qui, grâce à l’habileté du prestidigitateur, sans avoir rien de celle que j’avais suivie si longtemps au bord de la mer, lui avait été substituée. J’aurais du reste pu le deviner d’avance, puisque la jeune fille de la plage avait été fabriquée par moi. Malgré cela, comme je l’avais, dans mes conversations avec Elstir, identifiée à Albertine, je me sentais envers celle-ci l’obligation morale de tenir les promesses d’amour faites à l’Albertine imaginaire. On se fiance par procuration, et on se croit obligé d’épouser ensuite la personne interposée. D’ailleurs, si avait disparu provisoirement du moins de ma vie une angoisse qu’eût suffi à apaiser le souvenir des manières comme il faut, de cette expression « parfaitement commune » et de la tempe enflammée, ce souvenir éveillait en moi un autre genre de désir, qui bien que doux et nullement douloureux, semblable à un sentiment fraternel, pouvait à la longue devenir aussi dangereux en me faisant ressentir à tout moment le besoin d’embrasser cette personne nouvelle dont les bonnes façons et la timidité, la disponibilité inattendue, arrêtaient la course inutile de mon imagination, mais donnaient naissance à une gratitude attendrie. Et puis comme la mémoire commence tout de suite à prendre des clichés indépendants les uns des autres, supprime tout lien, tout progrès, entre les scènes qui y sont figurées, dans la collection de ceux qu’elle expose, le dernier ne détruit pas forcément les précédents. En face de la médiocre et touchante Albertine à qui j’avais parlé, je voyais la mystérieuse Albertine en face de la mer. C’étaient maintenant des souvenirs, c’est-à-dire des tableaux dont l’un ne me semblait pas plus vrai que l’autre. Pour en finir avec ce premier soir de présentation, en cherchant à revoir ce petit grain de beauté sur la joue au-dessous de l’œil, je me rappelai que de chez Elstir, quand Albertine était partie, j’avais vu ce grain de beauté sur le menton. En somme, quand je la voyais, je remarquais qu’elle avait un grain de beauté, mais ma mémoire errante le promenait ensuite sur la figure d’Albertine et le plaçait tantôt ici tantôt là.","I came home thinking of that morning, seeing again the eclair at the coffee that I had finished eating before allowing myself to be led by Elstir to Albertine, the rose that I had given to the old gentleman, all these details chosen from our knowledge by the circumstances and which compose for us, in a special and fortuitous arrangement, the picture of a first meeting. But this painting, I had the impression of seeing it from another point of view, from very far from myself, understanding that it had not existed only for me, when a few months later, at my great astonishment, as I was talking to Albertine about the first day I had known her, she reminded me of the flash, the flower I had given, all that I believed, I cannot say was important only for me, but having been seen only by me, whom I thus found, transcribed in a version whose existence I had not suspected, in Albertine's mind. From that first day, when on entering I was able to see the souvenir I was bringing back, I understood what nutmeg trick had been perfectly executed, and how I had talked for a moment with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without to have none of the one I had followed so long by the seaside, had been substituted for it. I could have guessed it in advance, since the young girl on the beach had been made by me. Despite this, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified with Albertine, I felt a moral obligation towards her to keep the promises of love made to the imaginary Albertine. One becomes engaged by proxy, and one feels obliged to then marry the interposed person. Besides, if an anguish had disappeared temporarily, at least from my life, which would have sufficed to appease the memory of proper manners, of this ""perfectly common"" expression and of the inflamed temple, this memory awakened in me another kind of of desire, which although sweet and in no way painful, similar to a fraternal feeling, could in the long run become just as dangerous by making me constantly feel the need to embrace this new person whose good manners and shyness, unexpected availability , stopped the useless race of my imagination, but gave birth to tender gratitude. And then, as memory immediately begins to take shots independent of each other, suppresses all links, all progress, between the scenes which are represented there, in the collection of those which it exhibits, the last one does not necessarily destroy the previous ones. Opposite the mediocre and touching Albertine to whom I had spoken, I saw the mysterious Albertine opposite the sea. truer than the other. To put an end to this first evening of presentation, while trying to see again this little mole on the cheek below the eye, I remembered that from Elstir's, when Albertine had left, I had seen this speck of beauty. beauty on the chin. In short, when I saw her, I noticed that she had a mole, but my wandering memory then carried it over Albertine's face and placed it now here, now there.","I returned home, my mind full of the party, the coffee éclair which I had finished eating before I let Elstir take me up to Albertine, the rose which I had given the old gentleman, all the details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances of the occasion, which compose in a special and quite fortuitous order the picture that we retain of a first meeting. But this picture, I had the impression that I was seeing it from a fresh point of view, a long way remote from myself, realising that it had not existed only for me, when some months later, to my great surprise, on my speaking to Albertine on the day on which I had first met her, she reminded me of the éclair, the flower that I had given away, all those things which I had supposed to have been —I will not say of importance only to myself but—perceived only by myself, and which I now found thus transcribed, in a version the existence of which I had never suspected, in the mind of Albertine. On this first day itself, when, on my return to the hotel, I was able to visualise the memory which I had brought away with me, I realised the consummate adroitness with which the sleight of hand had been performed, and how I had talked for a moment or two with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without actually embodying anything of that other person whom I had for so long been following as she paced beside the sea, had been effectively substituted for her. I might, for that matter, have guessed as much in advance, since the girl of the beach was a fabrication invented by myself. In spite of which, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified her with this other girl, I felt myself in honour bound to fulfil to the real the promises of love made to the imagined Albertine. We betroth ourselves by proxy, and think ourselves obliged, in the sequel, to marry the person who has intervened. Moreover, if there had disappeared, provisionally at any rate, from my life, an anguish that found adequate consolation in the memory of polite manners, of that expression 'perfectly common' and of the glowing temple, that memory awakened in me desire of another kind which, for all that it was placid and not at all painful, resembling rather brotherly love, might in the long run become fully as dangerous by making me feel at every moment a compelling need to kiss this new person, whose charming ways, shyness, unlooked–for accessibility, arrested the futile process of my imagination but gave birth to a sentimental gratitude. And then, since memory begins at once to record photographs independent of one another , eliminates every link, any kind of sequence from between the scenes portrayed in the collection which it exposes to our view, the most recent does not necessarily destroy or cancel those that came before. Confronted with the commonplace though appealing Albertine to whom I had spoken that afternoon, I still saw the other, mysterious Albertine outlined against the sea. These were now memories, that is to say pictures neither of which now seemed to me any more true than the other. But, to make an end of this first afternoon of my introduction to Albertine, when trying to recapture that little mole on her cheek, just under the eye, I remembered that, looking from Elstir's window, when Albertine had gone by, I had seen the mole on her chin. In fact, whenever I saw her I noticed that she had a mole, but my inaccurate memory made it wander about the face of Albertine, fixing it now in one place, now in another.","On my way home from Elstir’s little reception, I thought about it, remembering the coffee eclair which I had finished before letting him take me to meet Albertine, the rose I had given to the old gentleman, all these details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances and which, in their special haphazard arrangement, constitute our picture of a first meeting. It was this same picture that, some months later, I had the impression of seeing from another point of view, one very remote from my own, and of realizing that it had not existed only for me: one day, as I spoke to Albertine about our first meeting, to my amazement she reminded me of the eclair, the flower I had given away, everything which I believed, not to be of importance only to myself, but to have been noticed only by me, and yet here they were, transcribed in a version which I had not suspected existed, in the mind of Albertine. Back at the hotel on that first day, when I could focus on the memory I had taken away with me, I saw the conjuring-trick which had been done, and how I had spent some time chatting to a person who, by the magician’s sleight of hand, had been substituted for the girl I had watched so often along the esplanade, and who had nothing in common with her. This I could have suspected in advance, as the young girl on the esplanade had been my own creation. Even so, since I had identified her with Albertine in my conversations with Elstir, I now felt a moral obligation towards the real Albertine to keep the promises of love made to the imaginary one. Betrothed by proxy, we feel constrained to marry the intermediary. Besides, though my life was now at least temporarily free of an anguish any recurrence of which could have been quickly cancelled by the memory of her properness, the expression ‘perfectly common’ and the flushed temple, this memory now roused in me a different sort of desire, which, though sweet and quite painless, rather like a brotherly feeling, was capable of becoming in time just as dangerous, by giving me a constant need to kiss this new person, whose good manners, shyness and unexpected availability curbed the futile surges of my imagination, but gave rise to a touching gratitude. Also, since memory immediately begins to take snap-shots which are quite independent of one another, abolishing all links and sequence among the scenes they show, in the collection of them which it displays, the latest does not necessarily obliterate the earlier ones. Beside the unremarkable and touching Albertine with whom I had chatted, I could see the mysterious Albertine against the backdrop of the sea. Both were now memories, pictures, that is, neither of which seemed truer than the other. The final image of my introduction to her that afternoon was that when I tried to remember the little beauty spot on her cheek, just below the eye, I realized that, after my first sight of her, when she had greeted Elstir in passing, I had seen it on her chin. Each time I saw Albertine, I noticed she had a beauty spot, and my misguided memory moved it about her face, sometimes putting it in one place, at other times in another."
"Et une fois qu’elle était plus particulièrement câline avec Swann, comme je le lui fis remarquer quand il fut loin :","And once she was particularly affectionate with Swann, as I pointed out to him when he was away:","And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:","And on another occasion when she had been more than usually loving with Swann, and I had referred to this after he had left us alone together, she replied:"

"– Vous avez un chef de tout premier ordre, Madame, dit M. de Norpois. Et ce n’est pas peu de chose. Moi qui ai eu à l’étranger à tenir un certain train de maison, je sais combien il est souvent difficile de trouver un parfait maître queux. Ce sont de véritables agapes auxquelles vous nous avez conviés là.","“You have a chief of the very first order, Madame,” said M. de Norpois. And that's no small thing. I, who had to keep a certain house routine abroad, know how difficult it is often to find a perfect master chef. These are real feasts to which you have invited us there.","""You have a chef of the first order, Madame,"" said M. de Norpois, ""and that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master–cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!""","‘You have a chef of superlative quality, Madame,’ said M. de Norpois. ‘And that is a thing worthy of note. Speaking as one who has had to keep up a certain standard of such things in foreign parts, I know how difficult it can often be to find the perfect Vatel.5 I see you have prepared a sumptuous repast for your guest.’"
"Et je plaignais un peu tous les dîneurs parce que je sentais que pour eux les tables rondes n’étaient pas des planètes et qu’ils n’avaient pas pratiqué dans les choses un sectionnement qui nous débarrasse de leur apparence coutumière et nous permet d’apercevoir des analogies. Ils pensaient qu’ils dînaient avec telle ou telle personne, que le repas coûterait à peu près tant et qu’ils recommenceraient le lendemain. Et ils paraissaient absolument insensibles au déroulement d’un cortège de jeunes commis qui, probablement n’ayant pas à ce moment de besogne urgente, portaient processionnellement des pains dans des paniers. Quelques-uns, trop jeunes, abrutis par les taloches que leur donnaient en passant les maîtres d’hôtel, fixaient mélancoliquement leurs yeux sur un rêve lointain et n’étaient consolés que si quelque client de l’hôtel de Balbec où ils avaient jadis été employés, les reconnaissant, leur adressait la parole et leur disait personnellement d’emporter le champagne qui n’était pas buvable, ce qui les remplissait d’orgueil.","And I felt sorry for all the diners a little because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not practiced in things a sectioning which rids us of their customary appearance and allows us to see analogies. They thought they were having dinner with such and such a person, that the meal would cost about that much and that they would start again the next day. And they seemed absolutely insensitive to the progress of a procession of young clerks who, probably not having any urgent work at the moment, were carrying loaves in baskets in procession. A few, too young, stupefied by the cuffs given them by the butlers as they passed, stared melancholy at a distant dream and were consoled only if some guest of the Hôtel de Balbec where they had once been employees, recognizing them, addressed them and personally told them to take away the champagne which was not drinkable, which filled them with pride.","And I rather pitied all the diners because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not cut through the scheme of things one of those sections which deliver us from the bondage of appearances and enable us to perceive analogies. They thought that they were dining with this or that person, that the dinner would cost roughly so much, and that to–morrow they would begin all over again. And they appeared absolutely unmoved by the progress through their midst of a train of young assistants who, having probably at that moment no urgent duty, advanced processionally bearing rolls of bread in baskets. Some of them, the youngest, stunned by the cuffs which the head waiters administered to them as they passed, fixed melancholy eyes upon a distant dream and were consoled only if some visitor from the Balbec hotel in which they had once been employed, recognising them, said a few words to them, telling them in person to take away the champagne which was not fit to drink, an order that filled them with pride.","I felt rather sorry for the diners, because I sensed that for them the round tables were not planets, and that they were unpractised in the art of cross-sectioning things so as to rid them of their customary appearance and enable us to see analogies. Their heads were full of the knowledge that they were dining with such and such a person, that the meal would cost this or that much, that they would probably eat another dinner the following day. They seemed absolutely impervious to the appearance of a procession of young waiters’ assistants who, probably having no urgent business to attend to, were processionally bringing in bread in baskets. Some of them, too young, and victimized by the senior waiters, who cuffed them about the head in passing, had their hangdog eyes on a distant day-dream, and cheered up only if a guest staying at the Balbec hotel, where they had been formerly employed, recognized them, spoke to them and asked them in person to take away the champagne, which was undrinkable, and this filled them with pride."
"Mais quelquefois au lieu d’aller dans une ferme, nous montions jusqu’au haut de la falaise, et une fois arrivés et assis sur l’herbe, nous défaisions notre paquet de sandwichs et de gâteaux. Mes amies préféraient les sandwiches et s’étonnaient de me voir manger seulement un gâteau au chocolat gothiquement historié de sucre ou une tarte à l’abricot. C’est qu’avec les sandwiches au chester et à la salade, nourriture ignorante et nouvelle, je n’avais rien à dire. Mais les gâteaux étaient instruits, les tartes étaient bavardes. Il y avait dans les premiers des fadeurs de crème et dans les secondes des fraîcheurs de fruits qui en savaient long sur Combray, sur Gilberte, non seulement la Gilberte de Combray mais celle de Paris aux goûters de qui je les avais retrouvés. Ils me rappelaient ces assiettes à petits fours, des Mille et une Nuits, qui distrayaient tant de leurs « sujets » ma tante Léonie quand Françoise lui apportait un jour Aladin ou la Lampe Merveilleuse, un autre Ali-Baba, le Dormeur éveillé ou Sinbad le Marin embarquant à Bassora avec toutes ses richesses. J’aurais bien voulu les revoir, mais ma grand’mère ne savait pas ce qu’elles étaient devenues et croyait d’ailleurs que c’était de vulgaires assiettes achetées dans le pays. N’importe, dans le gris et champenois Combray, elles et leurs vignettes s’encastraient multicolores, comme dans la noire église les vitraux aux mouvantes pierreries, comme dans le crépuscule de ma chambre les projections de la lanterne magique, comme devant la vue de la gare et du chemin de fer départemental les boutons d’or des Indes et les lilas de Perse, comme la collection de vieux Chine de ma grand’tante dans sa sombre demeure de vieille dame de province.","But sometimes instead of going to a farm, we would go up to the top of the cliff, and when we got there and sat on the grass, we would unpack our sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred sandwiches and were surprised to see me eat only a gothic chocolate cake with sugar or an apricot tart. It's that with the chester and salad sandwiches, ignorant and new food, I had nothing to say. But the cakes were educated, the pies were talkative. In the former there were blandnesses of cream and in the latter freshness of fruit which knew a lot about Combray, about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte de Combray but the one from Paris at whose tea parties I had found them. They reminded me of those plates of petit fours, from the Thousand and One Nights, which so distracted my aunt Léonie from their ""subjects"" when Françoise brought her one day Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another Ali-Baba, the Awakened Sleeper or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Basra with all its riches. I would have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them and, moreover, believed that they were vulgar plates bought in the country. No matter, in the gray and Champagne Combray, they and their multicolored vignettes were embedded, as in the black church the stained glass windows with moving jewels, as in the twilight of my room the projections of the magic lantern, as before the view of the station and the departmental railway, the buttercups of India and the lilacs of Persia, like my great-aunt's collection of old China in her gloomy home as an old provincial lady.","But at other times, instead of going to a farm, we would climb to the highest point of the cliff, and, when we had reached it and were seated on the grass, would undo our parcel of sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred the sandwiches, and were surprised to see me eat only a single chocolate cake, sugared with gothic tracery, or an apricot tart. This was because, with the sandwiches of cheese or of green–stuff, a form of food that was novel to me and knew nothing of the past, I had nothing in common. But the cakes understood, the tarts were gossips. There were in the former an insipid taste of cream, in the latter a fresh taste of fruit which knew all about Combray, and about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte of Combray but her too of Paris, at whose tea–parties I had found them again. They reminded me of those cake–plates of the Arabian Nights pattern, the subjects on which were such a distraction to my aunt Léonie when Françoise brought her up, one day, Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another day Ali–Baba, or the Sleeper Awakes, or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Bassorah with all his treasure. I should dearly have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them, and thought moreover that they were just common plates that had been bought in the village. No matter, in that grey, midland Combray scene they and their pictures were set like many–coloured jewels, as in the dark church were the windows with their shifting radiance, as in the dusk of my bedroom were the projections cast by the magic–lantern, as in the foreground of the view of the railway–station and the little local line the buttercups from the Indies and the Persian lilacs, as were my great–aunt's shelves of old porcelain in the sombre dwelling of an elderly lady in a country town.","Sometimes, though, instead of stopping at one of the farmhouses, we climbed to the top of the cliff; and having reached our destination, we would sit on the grass and unwrap our sandwiches and cakes. The girls all preferred sandwiches and exclaimed at seeing me eat only a chocolate cake, with its Gothic architecture of icing, or an apricot tart. But sandwiches of Cheshire cheese and lettuce, untried and unknowing fare, had nothing to say for themselves. Whereas cakes were privy to much, and tarts were talkative. In cakes, there was a cloying creaminess, and in tarts, a refreshing fruitiness, which were aware of many things about Combray and about Gilberte, and not just the Gilberte of Combray days, but the Gilberte of Paris too, for I had renewed my acquaintance with them at her afternoon teas. They brought back the illustrated Arabian Nights side-plates which had once afforded such a variety of entertainment to my Aunt Léonie, depending on whether Françoise brought her one day Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp or on another day Ali Baba or The Sleeper Awakes or Sinbad the Sailor Taking Ship at Basra with All his Riches. I wished I could see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them; and in any case she believed they were just vulgar old plates, which had been bought locally. Even so, their multicoloured vignettes glowed among the greyness of Combray-in-Champagne,107 like the shimmer of the jewelled windows in the dark of its church, the illuminations from the magic lantern in the twilight of my bedroom, the buttercups from the Indies and the lilacs from Persia in the foreground of the view of the railway-station and the little local line, or the collection of old Chinese porcelain at my great-aunt’s, an old lady’s gloomy house in a country town."

"« Après un trajet qui, me disait-il, s’est bien effectué, en lisant un livre acheté à la gare, qui est par Arvède Barine (c’est un auteur russe, je pense, cela m’a paru remarquablement écrit pour un étranger, mais donnez-moi votre appréciation, car vous devez connaître cela, vous, puits de science qui avez tout lu), me voici revenu au milieu de cette vie grossière, où hélas, je me sens bien exilé, n’y ayant pas ce que j’ai laissé à Balbec ; cette vie où je ne retrouve aucun souvenir d’affection, aucun charme d’intellectualité ; vie dont vous mépriseriez sans doute l’ambiance et qui n’est pourtant pas sans charme. Tout m’y semble avoir changé depuis que j’en étais parti, car dans l’intervalle, une des ères les plus importantes de ma vie, celle d’où notre amitié date, a commencé. J’espère qu’elle ne finira jamais. Je n’ai parlé d’elle, de vous, qu’à une seule personne, qu’à mon amie qui m’a fait la surprise de venir passer une heure auprès de moi. Elle aimerait beaucoup vous connaître et je crois que vous vous accorderiez, car elle est aussi extrêmement littéraire. En revanche, pour repenser à nos causeries, pour revivre ces heures que je n’oublierai jamais, je me suis isolé de mes camarades, excellents garçons, mais qui eussent été bien incapables de comprendre cela. Ce souvenir des instants passés avec vous, j’aurais presque mieux aimé, pour le premier jour, l’évoquer pour moi seul et sans vous écrire. Mais j’ai craint que vous, esprit subtil et cœur ultra-sensitif, ne vous mettiez martel en tête en ne recevant pas de lettre, si toutefois vous avez daigné abaisser votre pensée sur le rude cavalier que vous aurez fort à faire pour dégrossir et rendre un peu plus subtil et plus digne de vous. »","“After a journey which, he told me, went well, reading a book bought at the station, which is by Arvède Barine (he is a Russian author, I think, it seemed to me remarkably well written for a foreigner, but give me your appreciation, because you must know that, you well of knowledge who have read everything), here I am back in the middle of this coarse life, where alas, I feel very exiled, having no not what I left at Balbec; this life where I find no memory of affection, no charm of intellectuality; life whose atmosphere you would probably despise and which is not without charm. Everything seems to have changed there since I left, for in the meantime one of the most important eras of my life, the one from which our friendship dates, has begun. I hope it never ends.

He may be able to give you some good advice,"" plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that, next morning, I was to embark as cabin–boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world.","By this time, my father had no doubt I would be a member of the Académie in a very few years; and his satisfaction was increased when M. de Norpois, after a momentary pause, in which he appeared to ponder the consequences of such an act, handed me a card and said, ‘Go and see him, tell him I sent you – I warrant he’ll have some good advice to give you,’ words which caused me as much heartache and alarm as if he had told me I was to be taken on the very next day as a cabin-boy on a clipper."
"Avec une énergie de vieux connaisseur, qui tranchait sur la modération habituelle de ses propos :","With the energy of an old connoisseur, who contrasted with the usual moderation of his remarks:","All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: ""Quite excellent!""","M. de Norpois’s reply, delivered with all the energy of the old connoisseur, was at variance with the moderation with which he was accustomed to express himself:"
"Ma mère, voyant que j’avais peine à contenir mes larmes, me disait : « Régulus avait coutume dans les grandes circonstances… Et puis ce n’est pas gentil pour ta maman. Citons Madame de Sévigné, comme ta grand’mère : « Je vais être obligée de me servir de tout le courage que tu n’as pas. » Et se rappelant que l’affection pour autrui détourne des douleurs égoïstes, elle tâchait de me faire plaisir en me disant qu’elle croyait que son trajet de Saint-Cloud s’effectuerait bien, qu’elle était contente du fiacre qu’elle avait gardé, que le cocher était poli et la voiture confortable. Je m’efforçais de sourire à ces détails et j’inclinais la tête d’un air d’acquiescement et de satisfaction. Mais ils ne m’aidaient qu’à me représenter avec plus de vérité le départ de Maman et c’est le cœur serré que je la regardais comme si elle était déjà séparée de moi, sous ce chapeau de paille rond qu’elle avait acheté pour la campagne, dans une robe légère qu’elle avait mise à cause de cette longue course par la pleine chaleur, et qui la faisaient autre, appartenant déjà à la villa de « Montretout » où je ne la verrais pas.","My mother, seeing that I was struggling to contain my tears, said to me: “Regulus was used to it in great circumstances… And then it’s not nice for your mom. Let's quote Madame de Sévigné, like your grandmother: ""I'm going to have to use all the courage you don't have. And remembering that affection for others diverts selfish pain, she tried to please me by telling me that she thought her trip to Saint-Cloud would go well, that she was happy with the cab she was driving. had kept, that the coachman was polite and the car comfortable. I forced myself to smile at these details and nodded in agreement and satisfaction. But they only helped me to picture Mom leaving more truthfully, and it was with a heavy heart that I looked at her as if she were already separated from me, under that round straw hat she had bought. for the country, in a light dress which she had put on because of this long walk in the blazing heat, and which made her look different, already belonging to the villa of ""Montretout"" where I would not see her.","My mother, seeing that I had difficulty in keeping back my tears, said to me: ""'Regulus was in the habit, when things looked grave….' Besides, it isn't nice for Mamma! What does Mme. de Sévigné say? Your grandmother will tell you: 'I shall be obliged to draw upon all the courage that you lack.'"" And remembering that affection for another distracts one's selfish griefs, she endeavoured to beguile me by telling me that she expected the removal to Saint–Cloud to go without a hitch, that she liked the cab, which she had kept waiting, that the driver seemed civil and the seats comfortable. I made an effort to smile at these trifles, and bowed my head with an air of acquiescence and satisfaction. But they helped me only to depict to myself with more accuracy Mamma's imminent departure, and it was with an agonised heart that I gazed at her as though she were already torn from me, beneath that wide–brimmed straw hat which she had bought to wear in the country, in a flimsy dress which she had put on in view of the long drive through the sweltering midday heat; hat and dress making her some one else, some one who belonged already to the Villa Montretout, in which I should not see her.","My mother, seeing that I was on the verge of tears, said, ‘Regulus was accustomed, at moments of great consequence … 5 And it’s not very nice for his dear Mama either. We’d better take a leaf out of your grandma’s book and quote from Mme de Sévigné: “I’ll have to draw on all the courage which you lack.” ’ 6 Then, knowing that affection for others can divert one from grief for self, she tried to amuse me by saying that she thought her trip out to Saint-Cloud would be enjoyable, that she was very pleased with the hansom she had booked, that the driver was polite and his cab comfortable. Nodding with apparent acquiescence and satisfaction, I did my best to smile at these details. But all they did was help me to imagine more graphically Mama’s departure; and I stared at her, sick at heart, as though she was already separated from me, in her round straw hat, bought for the stay in the country, and the light frock, put on because of the long trip by cab on such a hot day, which changed her into someone else, made her belong already to the Villa de Montretout, where I would never see her."
"En rentrant, j’aperçus, je me rappelai brusquement l’image, cachée jusque-là, dont m’avait approché, sans me la laisser voir ni reconnaître, le frais, sentant presque la suie, du pavillon treillagé. Cette image était celle de la petite pièce de mon oncle Adolphe, à Combray, laquelle exhalait en effet le même parfum d’humidité. Mais je ne pus comprendre et je remis à plus tard de chercher pourquoi le rappel d’une image si insignifiante m’avait donné une telle félicité. En attendant, il me sembla que je méritais vraiment le dédain de M. de Norpois ; que j’avais préféré jusqu’ici à tous les écrivains celui qu’il appelait un simple « joueur de flûte » et une véritable exaltation m’avait été communiquée, non par quelque idée importante, mais par une odeur de moisi.","On returning, I saw, I suddenly remembered the image, hidden until then, which I had approached, without letting me see or recognize it, the cool, almost smelling of soot, of the trellised pavilion. This image was that of my uncle Adolphe's little room at Combray, which in fact exhaled the same perfume of dampness. But I could not understand and I postponed to find out why the recall of such an insignificant image had given me such bliss. In the meantime, it seemed to me that I truly deserved M. de Norpois's disdain; that I had hitherto preferred to all writers the one he called a simple ""piper,"" and a real exaltation had been communicated to me, not by any important idea, but by a musty smell.","On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe's little sitting–room at Combray, which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere ""flute–player"" and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell.","On the way home, I suddenly recognized the hitherto hidden memory of the impression which I had been drawn towards by the cool, almost sooty air of the little trellised booth, but without being able to glimpse it or identify it. It was the memory of my uncle Adolphe’s little room in the house at Combray, which was full of the same dampish redolence. I could not understand, and I postponed the effort of finding out, why the memory of such an insignificant impression should have filled me with such bliss. This made me feel that I really did deserve the disdain of M. de Norpois: not only was my favourite writer someone he dismissed as a ‘flute-player’, but I had experienced a moment of genuine rapture, not from some idea of importance, but from a musty smell."
"Ce qui m’étonnait plus chez Bloch que ses mauvaises manières, c’était combien la qualité de sa conversation était inégale. Ce garçon si difficile, qui des écrivains les plus en vogue disait : « C’est un sombre idiot, c’est tout à fait un imbécile », par moments racontait avec une grande gaieté des anecdotes qui n’avaient rien de drôle et citait comme « quelqu’un de vraiment curieux » tel homme entièrement médiocre. Cette double balance pour juger de l’esprit, de la valeur, de l’intérêt des êtres, ne laissa pas de m’étonner jusqu’au jour où je connus M. Bloch père.","What surprised me more about Bloch than his bad manners was how uneven the quality of his conversation was. This difficult boy, who of the most fashionable writers said: ""He's a gloomy idiot, he's quite an imbecile"", at times told with great gaiety anecdotes which had nothing funny about him and quoted as ""someone really curious"" such an entirely mediocre man. This double scale for judging the wit, the value, the interest of human beings never ceased to amaze me until the day when I met M. Bloch Senior.","What astonished me more in Bloch than his bad manners was to find how the quality of his conversation varied. This youth, so hard to please that of authors who were at the height of their fame he would say: ""He's a gloomy idiot; he's a sheer imbecile,"" would every now and then tell, with immense gusto, stories that were simply not funny or would instance as a 'really remarkable person' some man who was completely insignificant. This double scale of measuring the wit, the worth, the interest of people continued to puzzle me until I was introduced to M. Bloch, senior.","There was a thing about Bloch that surprised me more than his tactlessness, and that was how uneven his conversation was. This fellow, who could dismiss the most up-to-the-minute writer with, ‘The chap’s a dismal imbecile, an out-and-out idiot!’ was capable of revelling in unfunny anecdotes and judging a complete mediocrity to be ‘somebody really interesting’. This dual standard of judgment, applied to the mind, the merit and the interestingness of people, was something of a mystery to me until the day I met M. Bloch senior."
"J’étais arrivé à une presque complète indifférence à l’égard de Gilberte, quand deux ans plus tard je partis avec ma grand’mère pour Balbec. Quand je subissais le charme d’un visage nouveau, quand c’était à l’aide d’une autre jeune fille que j’espérais connaître les cathédrales gothiques, les palais et les jardins de l’Italie, je me disais tristement que notre amour, en tant qu’il est l’amour d’une certaine créature, n’est peut-être pas quelque chose de bien réel, puisque si des associations de rêveries agréables ou douloureuses peuvent le lier pendant quelque temps à une femme jusqu’à nous faire penser qu’il a été inspiré par elle d’une façon nécessaire, en revanche si nous nous dégageons volontairement ou à notre insu de ces associations, cet amour, comme s’il était au contraire spontané et venait de nous seuls, renaît pour se donner à une autre femme. Pourtant au moment de ce départ pour Balbec, et pendant les premiers temps de mon séjour, mon indifférence n’était encore qu’intermittente. Souvent (notre vie étant si peu chronologique, interférant tant d’anachronismes dans la suite des jours), je vivais dans ceux, plus anciens que la veille ou l’avant-veille, où j’aimais Gilberte. Alors ne plus la voir m’était soudain douloureux, comme c’eût été dans ce temps-là. Le moi qui l’avait aimée, remplacé déjà presque entièrement par un autre, resurgissait, et il m’était rendu beaucoup plus fréquemment par une chose futile que par une chose importante. Par exemple, pour anticiper sur mon séjour en Normandie, j’entendis à Balbec un inconnu que je croisai sur la digue dire : « La famille du directeur du ministère des Postes. » Or (comme je ne savais pas alors l’influence que cette famille devait avoir sur ma vie), ce propos aurait dû me paraître oiseux, mais il me causa une vive souffrance, celle qu’éprouvait un moi, aboli pour une grande part depuis longtemps, à être séparé de Gilberte. C’est que jamais je n’avais repensé à une conversation que Gilberte avait eue devant moi avec son père, relativement à la famille du « directeur du ministère des Postes ». Or, les souvenirs d’amour ne font pas exception aux lois générales de la mémoire, elles-mêmes régies par les lois plus générales de l’habitude. Comme celle-ci affaiblit tout, ce qui nous rappelle le mieux un être, c’est justement ce que nous avions oublié (parce que c’était insignifiant et que nous lui avions ainsi laissé toute sa force). C’est pourquoi la meilleure part de notre mémoire est hors de nous, dans un souffle pluvieux, dans l’odeur de renfermé d’une chambre ou dans l’odeur d’une première flambée, partout où nous retrouvons de nous-même ce que notre intelligence, n’en ayant pas l’emploi, avait dédaigné, la dernière réserve du passé, la meilleure, celle qui quand toutes nos larmes semblent taries, sait nous faire pleurer encore. Hors de nous ? En nous pour mieux dire, mais dérobée à nos propres regards, dans un oubli plus ou moins prolongé. C’est grâce à cet oubli seul que nous pouvons de temps à autre retrouver l’être que nous fûmes, nous placer vis-à-vis des choses comme cet être l’était, souffrir à nouveau, parce que nous ne sommes plus nous, mais lui, et qu’il aimait ce qui nous est maintenant indifférent. Au grand jour de la mémoire habituelle, les images du passé pâlissent peu à peu, s’effacent, il ne reste plus rien d’elles, nous ne le retrouverons plus. Ou plutôt nous ne le retrouverions plus, si quelques mots (comme « directeur au ministère des Postes ») n’avaient été soigneusement enfermés dans l’oubli, de même qu’on dépose à la Bibliothèque Nationale un exemplaire d’un livre qui sans cela risquerait de devenir introuvable.","I had arrived at an almost complete indifference towards Gilberte when two years later I left with my grandmother for Balbec. When I experienced the charm of a new face, when it was with the help of another young girl that I hoped to know the Gothic cathedrals, the palaces and the gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that our love, insofar as it is the love of a certain creature, is perhaps not something very real, since whether associations of pleasant or painful daydreams can bind it for some time to a woman until to make us think that it was inspired by her in a necessary way, on the other hand if we free ourselves voluntarily or without our knowledge from these associations, this love, as if it were on the contrary spontaneous and came from us alone, reborn to give himself to another woman. However, at the time of this departure for Balbec, and during the first days of my stay, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often (our life being so little chronological, interfering with so many anachronisms in the sequence of days), I lived in those, older than the day before or the day before, where I loved Gilberte. So not seeing her again was suddenly painful to me, as it would have been in those days. The me who had loved her, already almost entirely replaced by another, reappeared, and it was returned to me much more frequently by a trivial thing than by an important thing. For example, to anticipate my stay in Normandy, I heard a stranger at Balbec whom I met on the dyke say: “The family of the director of the Ministry of Posts. Now (as I did not know at the time the influence that this family must have had on my life), this statement should have seemed to me pointless, but it caused me great suffering, that experienced by a self, largely abolished for a long time, to be separated from Gilberte. It was because I had never thought of a conversation that Gilberte had had in front of me with her father, relative to the family of the ""Director of the Post Office Department."" Now, memories of love are no exception to the general laws of memory, which are themselves governed by the more general laws of habit. As this weakens everything, what best reminds us of a being is precisely what we had forgotten (because it was insignificant and we had thus left all its strength to it). This is why the best part of our memory is outside of us, in a rainy breath, in the stale smell of a room or in the smell of a first outbreak, wherever we find of ourselves this that our intelligence, having no use for it, had disdained the last reserve of the past, the best, the one that when all our tears seem to have dried up, knows how to make us cry again. Out of us? In us, to put it better, but hidden from our own eyes, in a more or less prolonged oblivion. It is thanks to this forgetting alone that we can from time to time rediscover the being that we were, place ourselves vis-à-vis things as this being was, suffer again, because we are no longer ourselves. , but he, and that he loved what is now indifferent to us. In the broad daylight of habitual memory, the images of the past fade little by little, fade away, there is nothing left of them, we will never find it again. Or rather, we would not find it again, if a few words (such as ""director at the Ministry of Posts"") had not been carefully locked up in oblivion, just as one deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which without it might become untraceable.","The Place I had arrived at a state almost of complete indifference to Gilberte when, two years later, I went with my grandmother to Balbec. When I succumbed to the attraction of a strange face, when it was with the help of some other girl that I hoped to discover gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that this love of ours, in so far as it is love for one particular creature, is not perhaps a very real thing, since if the association of pleasant or unpleasant trains of thought can attach it for a time to a woman so as to make us believe that it has been inspired by her, in a necessary sequence of effect to cause, yet when we detach ourselves, deliberately or unconsciously, from those associations, this love, as though it were indeed a spontaneous thing and sprang from ourselves alone, will revive in order to bestow itself on another woman. At the time, however, of my departure for Balbec, and during the earlier part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often, our life being so careless of chronology, interpolating so many anachronisms in the sequence of our days, I lived still among those—far older days than yesterday or last week—in which I loved Gilberte. And at once not seeing her became as exquisite a torture to me as it had been then. The self that had loved her, which another self had already almost entirely supplanted, rose again in me, stimulated far more often by a trivial than by an important event. For instance, if I may anticipate for a moment my arrival in Normandy, I heard some one who passed me on the sea–front at Balbec refer to the 'Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and his family.' Now, seeing that as yet I knew nothing of the influence which that family was to exercise over my life, this remark ought to have passed unheeded; instead, it gave me at once an acute twinge, which a self that had for the most part long since been outgrown in me felt at being parted from Gilberte. Because I had never given another thought to a conversation which Gilberte had had with her father in my hearing, in which allusion was made to the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and to his family. Now our love memories present no exception to the general rules of memory, which in turn are governed by the still more general rules of Habit. And as Habit weakens every impression, what a person recalls to us most vividly is precisely what we had forgotten, because it was of no importance, and had therefore left in full possession of its strength. That is why the better part of our memory exists outside ourselves, in a blatter of rain, in the smell of an unaired room or of the first crackling brushwood fire in a cold grate: wherever, in short, we happen upon what our mind, having no use for it, had rejected, the last treasure that the past has in store, the richest, that which when all our flow of tears seems to have dried at the source can make us weep again. Outside ourselves, did I say; rather within ourselves, but hidden from our eyes in an oblivion more or less prolonged. It is thanks to this oblivion alone that we can from time to time recover the creature that we were, range ourselves face to face with past events as that creature had to face them, suffer afresh because we are no longer ourselves but he, and because he loved what leaves us now indifferent. In the broad daylight of our ordinary memory the images of the past turn gradually pale and fade out of sight, nothing remains of them, we shall never find them again. Or rather we should never find them again had not a few words (such as this 'Secretary to the Ministry of Posts') been carefully locked away in oblivion, just as an author deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which might otherwise become unobtainable.","the Place By the time my grandmother and I left for Balbec, two years later, I had reached a state of almost complete indifference towards Gilberte. At times, as when I was under the spell of a new face, or if the companion with whom I imagined discovering the great Gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy was some other girl, I would reflect sadly that the love one feels, insofar as it is love for a particular person, may not be a very real thing, since although an association of pleasant or painful fancies may fix it for a time on a woman, and even convince us that she was its necessary cause, the fact is that if we consciously or unconsciously outgrow those associations, our love, as though it was a spontaneous growth, a thing of our own making, revives and offers itself to another woman. However, when I set off for Balbec, and during the first part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often (life being so unchronological, so anachronistic in its disordering of our days) I found myself living not on days immediately following the day or two before, but in the much earlier time when I had been in love with Gilberte. Suddenly it was as painful to be living apart from her as it would have been in that earlier time. The self of mine that had once loved her, though now almost entirely supplanted in me by another self, would revisit me; and when it did, it was brought back much more often by some trifling thing than by something important. For instance (if I may step forward for a moment to the actual visit to Normandy) one day in Balbec I was to overhear a stranger mention, as I walked past him on the esplanade, ‘The family of the chief under-secretary at the Postmaster General’s.’ At the time, given that I had no idea then of the influence which that family would have on my life, this mention should have passed me idly by. But it gave me a sharp stab of pain, the pain felt by a self which had long since mostly ceased to exist but which could still mourn the absence of Gilberte. For a conversation about the family of the ‘chief under-secretary at the Postmaster General’s’, which Gilberte and her father had once had in my presence, had gone completely from my mind. Memories of love are, in fact, no exception to the general laws of remembering, which are themselves subject to the more general laws of habit. Habit weakens all things; but the things which are best at reminding us of a person are those which, because they were insignificant, we have forgotten and which have therefore lost none of their power. Which is why the greater part of our memory exists outside us, in a dampish breeze, in the musty air of a bedroom or the smell of autumn’s first fires, things through which we can retrieve any part of us that the reasoning mind, having no use for it, disdained, the last vestige of the past, the best of it, the part which, after all our tears seem to have dried, can make us weep again. Outside us? Inside us, more like, but stored away from our mind’s eye, in that abeyance of memory which may last for ever. It is only because we have forgotten that we can now and then return to the person we once were, envisage things as that person did, be hurt again, because we are not ourselves any more, but someone else who once loved something that we no longer care about. The broad daylight of habitual memory gradually fades our images of the past, wears them away until nothing is left of them and the past becomes irrecoverable. Or rather, it would be irrecoverable, were it not that a few words (such as ‘chief under-secretary at the Postmaster General’s’) had been carefully put away and forgotten, much as a copy of a book is deposited in the Bibliothèque nationale against the day when it may become unobtainable."
"M. de Norpois, mille fois plus intelligent que moi, devait détenir cette vérité que je n’avais pas su extraire du jeu de la Berma, il allait me la découvrir ; en répondant à sa question, j’allais le prier de me dire en quoi cette vérité consistait ; et il justifierait ainsi ce désir que j’avais eu de voir l’actrice. Je n’avais qu’un moment, il fallait en profiter et faire porter mon interrogatoire sur les points essentiels. Mais quels étaient-ils ? Fixant mon attention tout entière sur mes impressions si confuses, et ne songeant nullement à me faire admirer de M. de Norpois, mais à obtenir de lui la vérité souhaitée, je ne cherchais pas à remplacer les mots qui me manquaient par des expressions toutes faites, je balbutiai, et finalement, pour tâcher de le provoquer et lui faire déclarer ce que la Berma avait d’admirable, je lui avouai que j’avais été déçu.","M. de Norpois, a thousand times more intelligent than I, must have possessed this truth which I had not been able to extract from Berma's game, he was going to discover it for me; in answering his question, I was going to ask him to tell me in what this truth consisted; and he would thus justify my desire to see the actress. I only had a moment, I had to take advantage of it and focus my questioning on the essential points. But what were they? Fixing my whole attention on my very confused impressions, and in no way dreaming of making myself admired by M. de Norpois, but of obtaining from him the desired truth, I did not seek to replace the words which I lacked by ready-made expressions. , I stammered, and finally, to try to provoke him and make him declare what was admirable about Berma, I confessed to him that I had been disappointed.","M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to extract from Berma's playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross–examination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready–made phrases for the words that failed me— I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed.","M. de Norpois, being incomparably cleverer than I was, must be in possession of the truth that I had been unable to derive from La Berma’s acting! He would be able to reveal it to me. In answer to his question, I was going to beg him to tell me where that truth lay; and in so doing he would vindicate the desire which had urged me to go and see her. I had no more than a moment to take advantage of, to focus my inquiries on the salient points. But what were they? Concentrating my whole attention on my impressions, which were hopelessly confused, with no thought of shining or finding favour, but in the hope of getting from him the truth I sought, I made no effort to substitute set phrases for the words which failed me, I made no sense and eventually, so as to have him say straight out what was so admirable about La Berma, I owned up to my disappointment."
"– Cela n’a d’ailleurs aucune espèce d’importance. Phrase analogue à un réflexe, la même chez tous les hommes qui ont de l’amour-propre, dans les plus graves circonstances aussi bien que dans les plus infimes ; dénonçant alors aussi bien que dans celle-ci combien importante paraît la chose en question à celui qui la déclare sans importance ; phrase tragique parfois qui la première de toutes s’échappe, si navrante alors, des lèvres de tout homme un peu fier à qui on vient d’enlever la dernière espérance à laquelle il se raccrochait, en lui refusant un service : « Ah ! bien, cela n’a aucune espèce d’importance, je m’arrangerai autrement » ; l’autre arrangement vers lequel il est sans aucune espèce d’importance d’être rejeté étant quelquefois le suicide.","- It doesn't really matter. A phrase analogous to a reflex, the same in all men who have self-esteem, in the most serious circumstances as well as in the most trivial; denouncing then as well as in this one how important the thing in question seems to him who declares it unimportant; Sometimes a tragic phrase which first of all escapes, so heartbreaking then, from the lips of any somewhat proud man from whom the last hope to which he clung has just been taken away, by refusing him a service: “Ah! well, it doesn't matter at all, I'll manage otherwise”; the other arrangement towards which it is without any kind of importance to be rejected being sometimes suicide.","And then, in a dry and lofty tone: ""Not that it is of the slightest importance."" A phrase that is like a reflex action of the body, the same in all men whose self–esteem is great, in the gravest circumstances as well as in the most trivial, betraying there as clearly as on this occasion how important the thing in question seems to him who declares that it is of no importance; a tragic phrase at times, the first to escape (and then how heart–breaking) the lips of every man at all proud from whom we have just taken the last hope to which he still clung by refusing to do him a service. "" Oh, well, it's not of the slightest importance; I shall make some other arrangement:"" the other arrangement which it is not of the slightest importance that he should be driven to adopt being often suicide.","To which, in a sharp and supercilious tone, he added, ‘Anyway – doesn’t matter.’ One may hear this statement, which is analogous to a reflex, spoken by all who have a touch of self-esteem, in circumstances which can vary from the trivial to the tragic, and which reveals, as it did on the present occasion, how much the thing which is said not to matter does matter to the speaker; and in the tragic vein, the first thing to come to the lips of any man who takes a certain pride in himself, if his last hope has just been dashed by someone’s refusal to help him out, may well be the brave, forlorn words: ‘ Oh well, it doesn’t matter, not to worry – I’ll think of something else,’ the something else which is the alternative to what ‘does not matter’ being sometimes the last resort of suicide."
"Souvent le jour était tombé avant que nous fussions de retour. Timidement je citais à Mme de Villeparisis en lui montrant la lune dans le ciel quelque belle expression de Chateaubriand, ou de Vigny, ou de Victor Hugo : « Elle répandait ce vieux secret de mélancolie » ou « pleurant comme Diane au bord de ses fontaines » ou « L’ombre était nuptiale, auguste et solennelle ».","Often day had fallen before we got back.

I would venture to quote to Mme de Villeparisis, indicating the risen moon, a fine line from Chateaubriand, Vigny or Victor Hugo: ‘The moon revealing her old secret of melancholy’ or ‘Weeping like Diana by her fountains’ or ‘The shades were nuptial, august and solemn’.31"
"Si je ne compris pas la Sonate, je fus ravi d’entendre jouer Mme Swann. Son toucher me paraissait, comme son peignoir, comme le parfum de son escalier, comme ses manteaux, comme ses chrysanthèmes, faire partie d’un tout individuel et mystérieux, dans un monde infiniment supérieur à celui où la raison peut analyser le talent. « N’est-ce pas que c’est beau cette Sonate de Vinteuil ? me dit Swann. Le moment où il fait nuit sous les arbres, où les arpèges du violon font tomber la fraîcheur. Avouez que c’est bien joli ; il y a là tout le côté statique du clair de lune, qui est le côté essentiel. Ce n’est pas extraordinaire qu’une cure de lumière comme celle que suit ma femme agisse sur les muscles, puisque le clair de lune empêche les feuilles de bouger. C’est cela qui est si bien peint dans cette petite phrase, c’est le bois de Boulogne tombé en catalepsie. Au bord de la mer c’est encore plus frappant, parce qu’il y a les réponses faibles des vagues que naturellement on entend très bien puisque le reste ne peut pas remuer. À Paris c’est le contraire ; c’est tout au plus si on remarque ces lueurs insolites sur les monuments, ce ciel éclairé comme par un incendie sans couleurs et sans danger, cette espèce d’immense fait divers deviné. Mais dans la petite phrase de Vinteuil, et du reste dans toute la Sonate, ce n’est pas cela, cela se passe au Bois, dans le gruppetto on entend distinctement la voix de quelqu’un qui dit : « On pourrait presque lire son journal. » Ces paroles de Swann auraient pu fausser, pour plus tard, ma compréhension de la Sonate, la musique étant trop peu exclusive pour écarter absolument ce qu’on nous suggère d’y trouver. Mais je compris par d’autres propos de lui que ces feuillages nocturnes étaient tout simplement ceux sous l’épaisseur desquels, dans maint restaurant des environs de Paris, il avait entendu, bien des soirs, la petite phrase. Au lieu du sens profond qu’il lui avait si souvent demandé, ce qu’elle rapportait à Swann, c’était ces feuillages rangés, enroulés, peints autour d’elle (et qu’elle lui donnait le désir de revoir parce qu’elle lui semblait leur être intérieure comme une âme), c’était tout un printemps dont il n’avait pu jouir autrefois, n’ayant pas, fiévreux et chagrin comme il était alors, assez de bien-être pour cela, et que (comme on fait, pour un malade, des bonnes choses qu’il n’a pu manger) elle lui avait gardé. Les charmes que lui avaient fait éprouver certaines nuits dans le Bois et sur lesquels la Sonate de Vinteuil pouvait le renseigner, il n’aurait pu à leur sujet interroger Odette, qui pourtant l’accompagnait comme la petite phrase. Mais Odette était seulement à côté de lui alors (non en lui comme le motif de Vinteuil) – ne voyant donc point – Odette eût-elle été mille fois plus compréhensive – ce qui, pour nul de nous (du moins j’ai cru longtemps que cette règle ne souffrait pas d’exceptions), ne peut s’extérioriser. « C’est au fond assez joli, n’est-ce pas, dit Swann, que le son puisse refléter comme l’eau, comme une glace. Et remarquez que la phrase de Vinteuil ne me montre que tout ce à quoi je ne faisais pas attention à cette époque. De mes soucis, de mes amours de ce temps-là, elle ne me rappelle plus rien, elle a fait l’échange. – Charles, il me semble que ce n’est pas très aimable pour moi tout ce que vous me dites là. – Pas aimable ! Les femmes sont magnifiques ! Je voulais dire simplement à ce jeune homme que ce que la musique montre – du moins à moi – ce n’est pas du tout la « Volonté en soi » et la « Synthèse de l’infini », mais, par exemple, le père Verdurin en redingote dans le Palmarium du Jardin d’Acclimatation. Mille fois, sans sortir de ce salon, cette petite phrase m’a emmené dîner à Armenonville avec elle. Mon Dieu, c’est toujours moins ennuyeux que d’y aller avec Mme de Cambremer. » Mme Swann se mit à rire : « C’est une dame qui passe pour avoir été très éprise de Charles », m’expliqua-t-elle du même ton dont, un peu avant, en parlant de Ver Meer de Delft, que j’avais été étonné de voir qu’elle connaissait, elle m’avait répondu : « C’est que je vous dirai que Monsieur s’occupait beaucoup de ce peintre-là au moment où il me faisait la cour. N’est-ce pas, mon petit Charles ? – Ne parlez pas à tort et à travers de Mme de Cambremer, dit Swann, dans le fond très flatté. – Mais je ne fais que répéter ce qu’on m’a dit. D’ailleurs il paraît qu’elle est très intelligente, je ne la connais pas. Je la crois très « pushing », ce qui m’étonne d’une femme intelligente. Mais tout le monde dit qu’elle a été folle de vous, cela n’a rien de froissant. » Swann garda un mutisme de sourd, qui était une espèce de confirmation, et une preuve de fatuité. « Puisque ce que je joue vous rappelle le Jardin d’Acclimatation, reprit Mme Swann en faisant par plaisanterie semblant d’être piquée, nous pourrions le prendre tantôt comme but de promenade si ça amuse ce petit. Il fait très beau et vous retrouveriez vos chères impressions ! À propos du Jardin d’Acclimatation, vous savez, ce jeune homme croyait que nous aimions beaucoup une personne que je « coupe » au contraire aussi souvent que je peux, MmeBlatin ! Je trouve très humiliant pour nous qu’elle passe pour notre amie. Pensez que le bon docteur Cottard qui ne dit jamais de mal de personne déclare lui-même qu’elle est infecte. – Quelle horreur ! Elle n’a pour elle que de ressembler tellement à Savonarole. C’est exactement le portrait de Savonarole par Fra Bartolomeo. » Cette manie qu’avait Swann de trouver ainsi des ressemblances dans la peinture était défendable, car même ce que nous appelons l’expression individuelle est – comme on s’en rend compte avec tant de tristesse quand on aime et qu’on voudrait croire à la réalité unique de l’individu – quelque chose de général, et a pu se rencontrer à différentes époques. Mais si on avait écouté Swann, les cortèges des rois mages, déjà si anachroniques quand Benozzo Gozzoli y introduisit les Médicis, l’eussent été davantage encore puisqu’ils eussent contenu les portraits d’une foule d’hommes, contemporains non de Gozzoli mais de Swann, c’est-à-dire postérieurs non plus seulement de quinze siècles à la Nativité, mais de quatre au peintre lui-même. Il n’y avait pas selon Swann, dans ces cortèges, un seul Parisien de marque qui manquât, comme dans cet acte d’une pièce de Sardou où, par amitié pour l’auteur et la principale interprète, par mode aussi, toutes les notabilités parisiennes, de célèbres médecins, des hommes politiques, des avocats, vinrent pour s’amuser, chacun un soir, figurer sur la scène. « Mais quel rapport a-t-elle avec le Jardin d’Acclimatation ? – Tous ! – Quoi, vous croyez qu’elle a un derrière bleu ciel comme les singes ? – Charles, vous êtes d’une inconvenance ! – Non, je pensais au mot que lui a dit le Cynghalais. – Racontez-le-lui, c’est vraiment « un beau mot ». – C’est idiot. Vous savez que MmeBlatin aime à interpeller tout le monde d’un air qu’elle croit aimable et qui est surtout protecteur. – Ce que nos bons voisins de la Tamise appellent patronising, interrompit Odette. – Elle est allée dernièrement au Jardin d’Acclimatation où il y a des noirs, des Cynghalais, je crois, a dit ma femme, qui est beaucoup plus forte en ethnographie que moi. – Allons, Charles, ne vous moquez pas. – Mais je ne me moque nullement. Enfin, elle s’adresse à un de ces noirs : « Bonjour, négro ! » – C’est un rien ! – En tous cas ce qualificatif ne plut pas au noir. « Moi négro, dit-il avec colère à MmeBlatin, mais toi, chameau ! » – Je trouve cela très drôle ! J’adore cette histoire. N’est-ce pas que c’est « beau » ? On voit bien la mère Blatin : « Moi négro, mais toi chameau ! » Je manifestai un extrême désir d’aller voir ces Cynghalais dont l’un avait appelé MmeBlatin : chameau. Ils ne m’intéressaient pas du tout. Mais je pensais que pour aller au Jardin d’Acclimatation et en revenir nous traverserions cette allée des Acacias où j’avais tant admiré Mme Swann, et que peut-être le mulâtre ami de Coquelin, à qui je n’avais jamais pu me montrer saluant Mme Swann, me verrait assis à côté d’elle au fond d’une victoria.","If I did not understand the Sonata, I was delighted to hear Madame Swann play. Her touch seemed to me, like her bathrobe, like the perfume on her staircase, like her coats, like her chrysanthemums, to be part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that where reason can analyze talent. “Isn’t this Vinteuil Sonata beautiful? said Swann to me. The moment when it is dark under the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin make the coolness fall. Admit that it is very pretty; there is the whole static side of moonlight, which is the essential side. It is not extraordinary that a cure of light like the one my wife follows acts on the muscles, since the moonlight prevents the leaves from moving. This is what is so well painted in this little sentence, it is the Bois de Boulogne fallen into catalepsy. At the seaside it is even more striking, because there are the weak responses of the waves that naturally we hear very well since the rest cannot move. In Paris it is the opposite; it is at most if one notices these unusual lights on the monuments, this sky lit as by a fire without colors and without danger, this sort of immense divined news item. But in Vinteuil's little phrase, and indeed throughout the Sonata, it is not that, it takes place in the Bois, in the gruppetto we distinctly hear the voice of someone saying: ""One could almost read his log. These words of Swann could have distorted, for later, my understanding of the Sonata, the music being too non-exclusive to absolutely rule out what we are suggested to find there. But I understood from other remarks of his that these nocturnal leaves were quite simply those under the thickness of which, in many a restaurant around Paris, he had heard, many evenings, the little phrase. Instead of the profound meaning that he had so often asked of her, what she brought back to Swann was those leaves arranged, rolled up, painted around her (and which she made him want to see again because it seemed to him their interior being like a soul), it was a whole spring which he had not been able to enjoy formerly, not having, feverish and chagrin as he was then, enough well-being for that, and that ( as one does, for a sick person, good things that he could not eat) she had kept for him. He could not have questioned Odette about the charms he had felt on certain nights in the Bois and about which the Vinteuil Sonata could inform him, who nevertheless accompanied him like the little phrase. But Odette was only next to him then (not in him like Vinteuil's motif) – therefore not seeing – had Odette been a thousand times more understanding – which, for none of us (at least I believed for a long time that this rule suffered no exceptions), cannot be externalized. ""It's actually quite pretty, isn't it,"" said Swann, ""that sound can reflect like water, like ice. And notice that Vinteuil's sentence only shows me everything I wasn't paying attention to at that time. Of my worries, of my loves of that time, she no longer reminds me of anything, she made the exchange. “Charles, it seems to me that it is not very kind to me what you are saying to me there. - Unfriendly ! The women are gorgeous! I simply wanted to say to this young man that what the music shows - at least to me - is not at all the ""Will in itself"" and the ""Synthesis of the Infinite"", but, for example, the father Verdurin in a frock coat in the Palmarium of the Jardin d'Acclimatation. A thousand times, without leaving this living room, this little sentence took me to dinner with her in Armenonville. My God, it's always less boring than going there with Madame de Cambremer. Madame Swann began to laugh: ""She is a lady who is said to have been very much in love with Charles,"" she explained to me in the same tone which, a little earlier, speaking of Ver Meer de Delft, that I had been astonished to see that she knew, she had replied: ""It's because I'll tell you that Monsieur was very busy with that painter when he was paying court to me."" Isn't it, my little Charles? ""Don't talk indiscriminately about Madame de Cambremer,"" said Swann, deep down very flattered. ""But I'm just repeating what I've been told. Besides, it seems that she is very intelligent, I do not know her. I think she is very ""pushing"", which surprises me of an intelligent woman. But everyone says she was crazy about you, that's okay. Swann kept a deaf silence, which was a kind of confirmation, and a proof of fatuity. ""Since what I'm playing reminds you of the Jardin d'Acclimatation,"" resumed Madame Swann, jokingly pretending to be piqued, ""we could take it later as a destination for a walk if that amuses this little one. The weather is very nice and you will find your dear impressions! About the Jardin d'Acclimatation, you know, this young man believed that we were very fond of a person whom, on the contrary, I ""cut"" as often as I can, Madame Blatin! I find it very humiliating for us that she passes for our friend. Think that the good Doctor Cottard who never speaks ill of anyone declares himself that she is infected. - How awful ! All she has for her is to look so much like Savonarola. This is exactly the portrait of Savonarola by Fra Bartolomeo. Swann's mania for finding likenesses in painting was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is—as one so sadly realizes when one loves and would like to believe to the unique reality of the individual – something general, and could meet at different times. But if we had listened to Swann, the processions of the Magi, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced the Medici there, would have been even more so since they would have contained the portraits of a crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but by Swann, that is to say not only fifteen centuries later than the Nativity, but four after the painter himself. There was not, according to Swann, in these processions, a single distinguished Parisian who was missing, as in this act of a play by Sardou where, out of friendship for the author and the main performer, also out of fashion, all the Parisian notables, famous doctors, politicians, lawyers, came to amuse themselves, each one one evening, to appear on the stage. “But what does it have to do with the Jardin d’Acclimatation? - All ! “What, do you think she has a sky-blue behind like monkeys?” “Charles, you are immodest! – No, I was thinking of the word the Cynghalese said to him. – Tell him, it really is “a beautiful word”. - It's silly. You know that Mrs. Blatin likes to challenge everyone with an air that she thinks is friendly and that is above all protective. ""What our good neighbors on the Thames call patronising,"" interrupted Odette. “She recently went to the Jardin d’Acclimatation where there are blacks, Cynghalese, I believe,” said my wife, who is much better at ethnography than I am. “Come on, Charles, don't laugh. ""But I'm not kidding. Finally, she addresses one of these blacks: “Hello, nigga! – It’s nothing! – In any case, this qualifier did not please the black man. ""Me nigga,"" he said angrily to Madame Blatin, ""but you camel!"" – I find that very funny! I love this story. Isn't that ""beautiful""? We can clearly see Mother Blatin: “Me negro, but you camel! I expressed an extreme desire to go and see these Cynghalese, one of whom had called Madame Blatin: camel. They didn't interest me at all. But I thought that to go to the Jardin d'Acclimatation and to return from it we would cross that alley of Acacias where I had so admired Madame Swann, and that perhaps the mulatto friend of Coquelin, to whom I had never been able to show myself greeting Madame Swann, would see me seated next to her at the back of a victoria.","If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me (like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums) to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. ""Attractive, isn't it, that Vinteuil sonata?"" Swann asked me. "" The moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he expresses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil's little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: 'I can almost see to read the paper!' "" These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it (which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul); was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had—feverish and moody as he then was—enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil's sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not (as the phrase had been) within him, and so had seen nothing—nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us (or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception) can be made externally visible. ""It is rather charming, don't you think,"" Swann continued, ""that sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil's phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values."" ""Charles, I don't think that's very polite to me, what you're saying."" ""Not polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews—to me, at least—is not for a moment 'Free–will' or 'In Tune with the Infinite,' but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm–house at the Jardin d'Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer."" Mme. Swann laughed. ""That is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,"" she explained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose existence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: ""I ought to explain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn't that so, Charles dear?"" ""You're not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!"" Swann checked her, secretly flattered. ""But I'm only repeating what I've been told. Besides, it seems that she's an extremely clever woman; I don't know her myself. I believe she's very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there's no harm in repeating that. "" Swann remained silent as a deaf–mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. "" Since what I'm playing reminds you of the Jardin d'Acclimatation,"" his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, ""we might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It's lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d'Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she's positively contagious."" ""A frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo. "" This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is—as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved—something diffused and general, which can be found existing at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou's plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by 'walking on.' ""But what has she got to do with the Jardin d'Acclimatation?"" ""Everything!"" ""What? You don't suggest that she's got a sky– blue behind, like the monkeys?"" ""Charles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem."" ""Oh, it's too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering."" ""What our good friends on the Thames call 'patronising,'"" interrupted Odette. "" Exactly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors—Cingalese , I think I heard my wife say; she is much 'better up' in ethnology than I am."" ""Now, Charles, you're not to make fun of poor me."" ""I've no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with 'Good morning, nigger!'… "" ""Oh, it's too absurd!"" ""Anyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. ' Me nigger,' he shouted (quite furious, don't you know), to Mme. Blatin, 'me nigger; you, old cow!'"" ""I do think that's so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it's a good one. Can't you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: ' Me nigger; you, old cow'? "" I expressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that Allée des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin's mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by.","Though I did not understand the sonata, I was delighted to hear Mme Swann play. Her touch on the keyboard, like her tea-gown, like her perfume drifting down the stairs, like her coats, like her chrysanthemums, seemed to me to belong to a mysterious and individual whole, that existed in a world far above the one in which the mind can analyse talent. ‘ That sonata of Vinteuil’s is nice, isn’t it? Swann said to me. That moment of nightfall under the trees, when the violin arpeggios make everything feel cool. You must admit, it’s very pretty. It’s captured the whole static quality of moonlight, which is moonlight’s most basic quality. It’s not surprising that a sunlight-treatment such as my wife is taking at the moment should act on the muscles, given that moonlight prevents leaves from moving. That’s what’s so neatly caught by that little phrase – the Bois de Boulogne in a catatonic trance. It’s even more striking by the seaside, because then you’ve got the muted responses of the waves, and they can be heard quite distinctly of course, since nothing else can move. In Paris it’s just the opposite: merely a strange glow, barely noticeable, on the fronts of the great buildings, and that faint glare in the sky, like the reflection from a house on fire, colourless and dangerless, that hint of some immense but banal happening somewhere … I must say, though, that the little phrase, the whole sonata, for that matter, does take place in the Bois de Boulogne – I mean, in the gruppetto you can clearly hear someone’s voice saying, “There’s almost enough light to read the paper by!” ’ Swann’s words might have had the result of distorting my eventual understanding of the sonata, as music is so versatile, too prone to suggestion to reject entirely whatever somebody hints we might hear in it. But I realized, from other things he said, that the leaves at night in their dense stillness were none other than the ones under which, on many an evening, dining in restaurants on the outskirts of Paris, he had sat listening to the little phrase. Instead of the depth of meaning which he had so often sought in it, what it now brought back to him was all that serried foliage, leafy motifs winding and painted all about it, leaves that the phrase made him yearn to go and see, because it seemed to live on inside them like a soul; it brought back the whole springtime of that past year which, in a fever of sorrow, he had been too hapless to savour, and which it had kept for him, as one keeps for an invalid the nice things he has been too unwell to eat. The Vinteuil sonata could tell Swann of the charm of certain nights in the Bois de Boulogne, about which it would have been pointless to ask Odette, although she had been no less with him on those nights than the little phrase. But she had only been sitting beside him (whereas the theme by Vinteuil was inside him); and even if she had been gifted with vastly greater understanding, she would have been unable to see what cannot be externalized for anyone (at least, I believed for a long time that this was a rule to which there were no exceptions). ‘But I mean, it is rather a neat touch, isn’t it, Swann said, that there can be reflections from sound as there are from water or from a mirror? Mind you, the only things that phrase of Vinteuil’s shows me now are all the things I didn’t pay attention to at the time. It’s swapped them for my worries and my love-affairs, which it has completely forgotten. – Charles! If you ask me, it sounds as though what you’re saying is not very complimentary to me! – Not complimentary! Aren’t women wonderful! I’m merely trying to point out to this young fellow here that what music shows, to me at any rate, is nothing like “The Will-in-Itself” or “The Synthesis of the Infinite”, but something like the palm house at the Zoo in the Bois de Boulogne, with old Verdurin in his frock-coat. I’ll have you know, that little phrase has come and taken me out to dine dozens of times at Armenonville. God knows it’s far nicer than going out there to dine with Mme de Cambremer.’ ‘That’s a lady who was said to have lost her heart to Charles,’ said Mme Swann, laughing, and in the same tone of voice in which she had just said of Vermeer of Delft, whom I was surprised to see she knew of, ‘Well, you see, that gentleman over there was greatly interested in that painter at the time when he was courting me. Isn’t that so, Charles my love? – Please do not take the name of Mme de Cambremer in vain, said Swann, who was really quite flattered. – I’m only repeating what I’ve heard said. Actually, she’s supposed to be very clever, though I’ve never met her. I believe she’s very pushing (here Mme Swann lapsed again into English), which really surprises me in a woman who’s clever. Anyway, everyone says she was head over heels in love with you – there’s nothing in that to take offence at.’ Swann turned a very obvious deaf ear, which served both to confirm the suggestion and to show his smugness. ‘ Well,’ said Mme Swann, with mock peevishness, ‘since my playing reminds you of the Zoo, perhaps we could go there this afternoon, if this young man feels like an outing? It’s a nice day and you, my love, could relive your memories! Speaking of the Zoo, do you know that this young fellow was under the apprehension that we were very fond of someone that I cut dead as often as I can – Mme Blatin, can you imagine! I think it’s degrading for people to think she’s a friend of ours. Even nice Dr Cottard, who wouldn’t speak evil of a soul, says the woman’s a pest. – Isn’t she ghastly! Her sole redeeming feature is that she’s the image of Savonarola. She’s exactly the portrait of Savonarola by Fra Bartolommeo.’ There was nothing implausible in this quirk of Swann’s, of seeing likenesses of real people in paintings: even what we call an individual expression is something general (as we discover to our chagrin when we are in love, and wish to believe in the unique reality of the individual), something which may well have manifested itself at different periods. If Swann was to be believed, the Journey of the Magi, anachronistic enough when Benozzo Gozzoli painted the faces of the Medici brothers into it, was even more in advance of its time, as it contained, he said, the portraits of a host of people, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, dating not just from fifteen centuries later than the Nativity, but from four centuries after the time of the painter himself. According to Swann, not one notable Parisian was missing from the retinue of the Magi, as in that scene from a play by Sardou in which, for the sake of their friendship with the playwright and the leading lady, so as to be in the fashion, but also for fun, all the men about town, the most famous doctors, politicians and lawyers took turns in playing a tiny non-speaking part, each of them being on stage at a different performance.41 ‘ But I don’t see Mme Blatin’s connection with the Zoo. – Oh, it’s obvious! – You mean she’s got a sky-blue backside like a monkey? – Charles, you’re being indecent! No, I was remembering what that Singhalese chap said to her that time. Tell him, it’s really such a lovely little story. – It’s too stupid. You see, Mme Blatin likes to address people in a way which she thinks is friendly, but which gives the impression that she’s talking down to them. – What our neighbours across the Channel call patronizing, Odette interrupted. – So recently she went to the Zoo, where there was this exhibition being given by black fellows, from Ceylon, I think, or so I’m told by my wife, who’s much better at ethnography than I am. – Charles, do stop being facetious. – I’m not being facetious in the slightest. So, there she is, saying to this black fellow, “ Good morning, blackie!” – Isn’t it just ducky? – Well, this form of speech was not to the black fellow’s liking – “ Me blackie,” he bellowed at Mme Blatin, “you camel!” – I think that’s a very funny story! I just love that story! Isn’t it lovely? Can’t you just see Mme Blatin’s face: “ Me blackie, you camel!” ’ I expressed a strong desire to go and see the Singhalese, one of whom had called Mme Blatin a camel. Not that I had the slightest interest in them. But I knew that, in going to and from the Zoo in the Bois de Boulogne, we would cross the allée des Acacias, where I had once distantly doted on Mme Swann; and I hoped that Coquelin’s42 half-caste friend, to whom I had always hoped in vain to show off by bowing to Odette as she passed, would see me now sitting by her side in the victoria."
"Tandis que j’entendais ma grand’mère, sans se froisser qu’il l’écoutât son chapeau sur la tête et tout en sifflotant, lui demander avec une intonation artificielle : « Et quels sont… vos prix ?… Oh ! beaucoup trop élevés pour mon petit budget », attendant sur une banquette, je me réfugiais au plus profond de moi-même, je m’efforçais d’émigrer dans les pensées éternelles, de ne laisser rien de moi, rien de vivant, à la surface de mon corps – insensibilisée comme l’est celle des animaux qui par inhibition font les morts quand on les blesse – afin de ne pas trop souffrir dans ce lieu où mon manque total d’habitude m’était rendu plus sensible encore par la vue de celle que semblait en avoir au même moment une dame élégante à qui le directeur témoignait son respect en prenant des familiarités avec le petit chien dont elle était suivie, le jeune gandin qui, la plume au chapeau, rentrait en demandant « s’il avait des lettres », tous ces gens pour qui c’était regagner leur home que de gravir les degrés en faux marbre. Et en même temps le regard de Minos, Éaque et Rhadamante (regard dans lequel je plongeai mon âme dépouillée, comme dans un inconnu où plus rien ne la protégeait) me fut jeté sévèrement par des messieurs qui, peu versés peut-être dans l’art de « recevoir », portaient le titre de « chefs de réception » ; plus loin, derrière un vitrage clos, des gens étaient assis dans un salon de lecture pour la description duquel il m’aurait fallu choisir dans le Dante, tour à tour les couleurs qu’il prête au Paradis et à l’Enfer, selon que je pensais au bonheur des élus qui avaient le droit d’y lire en toute tranquillité, ou à la terreur que m’eût causée ma grand’mère si dans son insouci de ce genre d’impressions elle m’eût ordonné d’y pénétrer.","While I heard my grandmother, without being offended when he listened to her, his hat on his head and while whistling, ask him with an artificial intonation: “And what are… your prices?… Oh! much too high for my small budget"", waiting on a bench, I took refuge in the depths of myself, I tried to emigrate in the eternal thoughts, to leave nothing of me, nothing alive, at the surface of my body – desensitized like that of animals which by inhibition play dead when they are injured – so as not to suffer too much in this place where my total lack of habit had made me even more sensitive by sight of that which an elegant lady seemed to have at the same time, to whom the director showed his respect by becoming familiar with the little dog by whom she was followed, the young gandin who, feather in hat, returned asking ""if he had letters”, all these people for whom it was to return to their homes to climb the false marble steps. And at the same time the look of Minos, Aeacus and Rhadamante (a look into which I plunged my stripped soul, as into an unknown where nothing protected it anymore) was thrown at me severely by gentlemen who, perhaps little versed in the art of “receiving”, bore the title of “heads of reception”; farther on, behind closed glass, people were seated in a reading room for the description of which I would have had to choose from Dante, in turn the colors he lends to Paradise and to Hell, according to whether I thought of the happiness of the chosen ones who had the right to read there in complete peace of mind, or of the terror my grandmother would have caused me if, in her carelessness about this kind of impression, she had ordered me to enter it. .","While I heard my grandmother, who shewed no sign of annoyance at his listening to her with his hat on his head and whistling through his teeth at her, ask him in an artificial voice, ""And what are… your charges?… Oh! far too high for my little budget,"" waiting upon a bench, I sought refuge in the innermost depths of my own consciousness, strove to migrate to a plane of eternal thoughts—to leave nothing of myself, nothing that lived and felt on the surface of my body, anaesthetised as are those of animals which by inhibition feign death when they are attacked—so as not to suffer too keenly in this place, with which my total unfamiliarity was made all the more evident to me when I saw the familiarity that seemed at the same moment to be enjoyed by a smartly dressed lady for whom the manager shewed his respect by taking liberties with the little dog that followed her across the hall , the young 'blood' with a feather in his hat who asked, as he came in, 'Any letters?'—all these people to whom it was an act of home–coming to mount those stairs of imitation marble. And at the same time the triple frown of Minos, Æacus and Rhadamanthus (beneath which I plunged my naked soul as into an unknown element where there was nothing now to protect it) was bent sternly upon me by a group of gentlemen who, though little versed perhaps in the art of receiving, yet bore the title 'Reception Clerks,' while beyond them again, through a closed wall of glass, were people sitting in a reading–room for the description of which I should have had to borrow from Dante alternately the colours in which he paints Paradise and Hell, according as I was thinking of the happiness of the elect who had the right to sit and read there undisturbed, or of the terror which my grandmother would have inspired in me if, in her insensibility to this sort of impression, she had asked me to go in there and wait for her by myself.","As I sat there on an ottoman and heard my grandmother, who was unperturbed by the fact that he listened to her with his hat on and whistled a little tune to himself, inquire of him in an artifical tone of voice, ‘So what are your … charges? Goodness me, much too much for my slender means!’ , I tried to shrink as far as possible into myself, to flee on the wings of eternal verities, to leave nothing of myself, nothing live, on the surface of my body – desensitized like the body of an animal which by inhibition feigns death when wounded – so as not to suffer too much pain in a place where my total lack of habit was made all the more agonizing by the sight of people who seemed to be in their element, an elegant lady for whom the manager showed his respect by freely fondling the little dog which followed her about, a young dandy who came strolling in wearing a hat with a feather and asking whether there was ‘Any post?’, people for whom climbing the imitation marble stairs meant they were almost home. At the same time, the baleful glare of Minos, Æacus and Rhadamanthus,10 in which I steeped my naked soul as though in some dread unknown where it had lost all protection, was turned upon me by three unreceptive individuals dignified by the title ‘Reception Service’; and a little further along, behind a glass partition, people sat in a reading-room to describe which, if I had borrowed colours from Dante, I would have had to use first those with which he depicts Paradise, then those with which he depicts Hell, as I imagined both the bliss of the chosen who had the right to sit in there quietly reading, and the torture my grandmother would visit upon me if, in her disregard for such emotions, she were to tell me to go in and join them."
"Dans ces réflexions sur la tristesse qu’il y a à vivre loin de ce qu’on aime (qui devaient amener ma grand’mère à me dire que le neveu de Mme de Villeparisis comprenait autrement bien certaines œuvres que sa tante, et surtout avait quelque chose qui le mettait bien au-dessus de la plupart des gens du club), M. de Charlus ne laissait pas seulement paraître une finesse de sentiment que montrent en effet rarement les hommes ; sa voix elle-même, pareille à certaines voix de contralto en qui on n’a pas assez cultivé le médium et dont le chant semble le duo alterné d’un jeune homme et d’une femme, se posait, au moment où il exprimait ces pensées si délicates, sur des notes hautes, prenait une douceur imprévue et semblait contenir des chœurs de fiancées, de sœurs, qui répandaient leur tendresse. Mais la nichée de jeunes filles que M. de Charlus, avec son horreur de tout efféminement, aurait été si navré d’avoir l’air d’abriter ainsi dans sa voix, ne s’y bornait pas à l’interprétation, à la modulation des morceaux de sentiment. Souvent, tandis que causait M. de Charlus, on entendait leur rire aigu et frais de pensionnaires ou de coquettes ajuster leur prochain avec des malices de bonnes langues et de fines mouches.","In these reflections on the sadness there is in living far from what one loves (which must have led my grandmother to tell me that Madame de Villeparisis's nephew understood certain works that his aunt had done differently, and above all had something that put him well above most of the people in the club), M. de Charlus did not only let appear a finesse of feeling that indeed men rarely show; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices in which the medium has not been cultivated enough and whose singing seems to be the alternating duet of a young man and a woman, arose when he was expressing these delicate thoughts, on high notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to contain choruses of brides and sisters, spreading their tenderness. But the brood of young girls whom M. de Charlus, with his horror of all effeminacy, would have been so sorry to have seemed to harbor thus in his voice, were not limited to interpretation, to modulation of the feeling pieces. Often, while M. de Charlus was talking, one heard their shrill, fresh laughter like boarders or coquettes adjusting their neighbor with the mischievousness of good tongues and fine flies.","In these reflexions upon the sadness of having to live apart from the person whom one loves (which were to lead my grandmother to say to me that Mme. de Villeparisis's nephew understood certain things quite as well as his aunt, but in a different way, and moreover had something about him that set him far above the average club man) M. de Charlus not only allowed a refinement of feeling to appear such as men rarely shew; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices which have not been properly trained to the right pitch, so that when they sing it sounds like a duet between a young man and a woman, singing alternately, mounted, when he expressed these delicate sentiments, to its higher notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to be embodying choirs of betrothed maidens, of sisters, who poured out the treasures of their love. But the bevy of young girls, whom M. de Charlus in his horror of every kind of effeminacy would have been so distressed to learn that he gave the impression of sheltering thus within his voice, did not confine themselves to the interpretation, the modulation of scraps of sentiment. Often while M. de Charlus was talking one could hear their laughter, shrill, fresh laughter of school–girls or coquettes quizzing their partners with all the archness of clever tongues and pretty wits.","In expressing these views on the sadness of the life lived without the loved one (views which led my grandmother to say to me later that the nephew of Mme de Villeparisis was in some ways a better judge of books than his aunt, and in particular that there was something in him that made him far superior to the majority of club-men), M. de Charlus not only showed a delicacy of sentiment which is indeed rarely to be found in a man; but his very voice, like certain contralto voices in which the middle register has been insufficiently trained and which, in song, sounds rather like an antiphonal duet between a young man and a woman, rose as he expressed these subtle insights to higher notes, took on an unexpected gentleness and seemed to echo choirs of brides and loving sisters. This bevy of girls which M. de Charlus, with his horror of effeminacy, would have been dismayed to know took over his voice, played a part not only in his interpretation and modulation of the passages full of sentiment. While he spoke, one could often hear their light laughter, the giggling of coquettes or schoolgirls full of pranks, mischief and teasing talk."

"Prenant feu aussitôt, je me dis que c’était une enfant timide quand elle aimait et que c’était pour moi, par amour pour moi, qu’elle était restée avec nous malgré les rebuffades d’Albertine, et qu’elle avait dû être heureuse de pouvoir m’avouer enfin, par ce regard souriant et bon, qu’elle serait aussi douce avec moi que terrible aux autres. Sans doute m’avait-elle remarqué sur la plage même quand je ne la connaissais pas encore et pensa-t-elle à moi depuis ; peut-être était-ce pour se faire admirer de moi qu’elle s’était moquée du vieux monsieur et parce qu’elle ne parvenait pas à me connaître qu’elle avait eu les jours suivants l’air morose. De l’hôtel, je l’avais souvent aperçue le soir se promenant sur la plage. C’était probablement avec l’espoir de me rencontrer. Et maintenant, gênée par la présence d’Albertine autant qu’elle l’eût été par celle de toute la bande, elle ne s’attachait évidemment à nos pas, malgré l’attitude de plus en plus froide de son amie, que dans l’espoir de rester la dernière, de prendre rendez-vous avec moi pour un moment où elle trouverait moyen de s’échapper sans que sa famille et ses amies le sussent et me donner rendez-vous dans un lieu sûr avant la messe ou après le golf. Il était d’autant plus difficile de la voir qu’Andrée était mal avec elle et la détestait.","Catching fire immediately, I tell myself that she was a shy child when she loved and that it was for me, out of love for me, that she had stayed with us despite Albertine's rebuffs, and that she had to to be happy to be able to admit to myself at last, by that smiling and good look, that she would be as gentle to me as terrible to others. No doubt she had noticed me on the beach even when I did not know her yet and she has been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it was to make herself admire me that she had made fun of the old gentleman and because she could not get to know me that she had looked morose on the following days. From the hotel, I had often seen her in the evening walking on the beach. It was probably with the hope of meeting me. And now, embarrassed by Albertine's presence as much as she would have been by that of the whole gang, she evidently followed our steps, despite her friend's increasingly cold attitude, only in hope to be the last, to make an appointment with me for a time when she finds a way to escape without her family and friends knowing about it and to arrange to meet me in a safe place before mass or after Golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andrée was bad with her and hated her.","At once kindled by her flame, I said to myself that this was a child who when in love grew shy, that it was for my sake, from love for me that she had remained with us, despite Albertine's rebuffs, and that she must have rejoiced in the opportunity to confess to me at last, by that smiling, friendly gaze, that she would be as kind to me as she was terrible to other people. Doubtless she had noticed me on the beach, when I still knew nothing of her, and had been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it had been to win my admiration that she mocked at the old gentleman, and because she had not succeeded in getting to know me that on the following days she appeared so morose. From the hotel I had often seen her, in the evenings, walking by herself on the beach. Probably in the hope of meeting me. And now, hindered as much by Albertine's presence as she would have been by that of the whole band, she had evidently attached herself to us, braving the increasing coldness of her friend's attitude, only in the hope of outstaying her, of being left alone with me, when she might make an appointment with me for some time when she would find an excuse to slip away without either her family's or her friends' knowing that she had gone, and would meet me in some safe place before church or after golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andrée had quarrelled with her and now detested her.","She went straight to my head: I told myself she was just a shy girl in love, that she had stayed with us, despite being snubbed by Albertine, for my sake, for the love of me, and that she must have been happy to be able to tell me at last, with this soft-hearted smile, that she would be as tender towards me as she was cruel towards others. She must have noticed me down on the beach, at a time when I had no knowledge of her, and must have been thinking about me ever since – perhaps her reason for laughing at the old gentleman had been so that I should admire her, perhaps her reason for going about, the following days, with such an unhappy look, was her displeasure at not being able to get to know me! Sitting in the hotel, I had often noticed her taking an evening stroll down by the beach. She must have been hoping to meet me! And now, as embarrassed by the presence of Albertine as she would have been by the whole gang of her girl-friends, it was clear that her only reason for dogging our footsteps, in the face of her friend’s increasing hostility towards her, was the hope of outstaying Albertine, of arranging a meeting with me for a moment when she would be able to slip away without the knowledge of her family or friends, and come to me at some secluded spot, before Mass or after her game of golf. It would be very difficult to see her, especially as she was on bad terms with Andrée, who hated her."
"Elle eut bientôt à l’égard de Saint-Loup qu’elle adorait une désillusion d’un autre genre, et d’une moindre dureté : elle apprit qu’il était républicain. Or bien qu’en parlant par exemple de la Reine de Portugal, elle dît avec cet irrespect qui dans le peuple est le respect suprême « Amélie, la sœur à Philippe », Françoise était royaliste. Mais surtout un marquis, un marquis qui l’avait éblouie, et qui était pour la République, ne lui paraissait plus vrai. Elle en marquait la même mauvaise humeur que si je lui eusse donné une boîte qu’elle eût cru d’or, de laquelle elle m’eût remercié avec effusion et qu’ensuite un bijoutier lui eût révélé être en plaqué. Elle retira aussitôt son estime à Saint-Loup, mais bientôt après la lui rendit, ayant réfléchi qu’il ne pouvait pas, étant le marquis de Saint-Loup, être républicain, qu’il faisait seulement semblant, par intérêt, car avec le gouvernement qu’on avait, cela pouvait lui rapporter gros. De ce jour sa froideur envers lui, son dépit contre moi cessèrent. Et quand elle parlait de Saint-Loup, elle disait : « C’est un hypocrite », avec un large et bon sourire qui faisait bien comprendre qu’elle le « considérait » de nouveau autant qu’au premier jour et qu’elle lui avait pardonné.","She soon had another kind of disillusionment with Saint-Loup, whom she adored, and a less severe one: she learned that he was a Republican. Now, although speaking for example of the Queen of Portugal, she said with that disrespect which in the people is the supreme respect “Amelie, Philippe’s sister”, Françoise was a royalist. But above all a marquis, a marquis who had dazzled her, and who was for the Republic, no longer seemed true to her. She showed the same bad humor as if I had given her a box which she thought was gold, for which she had thanked me profusely and which a jeweler had then revealed to her was plated. She immediately withdrew her esteem from Saint-Loup, but soon afterwards returned it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint-Loup, be a Republican, that he only pretended, out of self-interest, for with the government we had, it could bring him a lot of money. From that day her coldness towards him, her spite against me ceased. And when she spoke of Saint-Loup, she said: ""He's a hypocrite,"" with a broad, good smile that made it clear that she ""considered"" him again as much as on the first day and that she had forgiven.","She had presently, with respect to Saint–Loup, whom she worshipped, a disillusionment of a different kind and of less severity: she discovered that he was a Republican. Now for all that, when speaking, for instance, of the Queen of Portugal, she would say with that disrespect which is, among the people, the supreme form of respect: ""Amélie, Philippe's sister,"" Françoise was a Royalist. But when it came to a Marquis; a Marquis who had dazzled her at first sight, and who was for the Republic, seemed no longer real. And she shewed the same ill–humour as if I had given her a box which she had believed to be made of gold, and had thanked me for it effusively, and then a jeweller had revealed to her that it was only plated. She at once withdrew her esteem from Saint–Loup, but soon afterwards restored it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint–Loup, be a Republican, that he was just pretending, in his own interest, for with such a Government as we had it might be a great advantage to him. From that moment her coldness towards him, her resentment towards myself ceased. And when she spoke of Saint–Loup she said: ""He is a hypocrite,"" with a broad and friendly smile which made it clear that she 'considered' him again just as much as when she first knew him, and that she had forgiven him.","Françoise soon had to endure, with regard to Saint-Loup, whom she adored, a disillusionment of a different order, but more short-lived: she learned that he was a Republican. Despite the fact that, when she spoke, say, of the Queen of Portugal, she could say, with that homely disrespect which is the expression of supreme respect among the lower classes, ‘Amélie, that sister of Philippe’s’, Françoise was a royalist. But that someone who was not only a marquis, but a marquis who had dazzled her, could be a supporter of the Republic, seemed beyond the bounds of the possible. She was as peeved towards me as though I had given her a box which she had believed to be of solid gold, for which she had thanked me from the bottom of her heart, only to be told by a jeweller that it was just gold-plated. She instantly lost her admiration for Saint-Loup, which she soon gave back to him, however, it having occurred to her that, since he was the Marquis de Saint-Loup, he could not possibly be a Republican and was therefore only pretending, out of self-interest, since with ‘a government like that, he stood to make a bit out of it’. From then on, her coolness towards him and her spite towards me disappeared; and when she spoke of Saint-Loup, she would say, ‘He’s just a hypocrite,’ her broad, kindly smile showing that she thought as well of him as before and that she had forgiven him."
"C’est qu’en effet dans ces moments-là elle n’était pas naturelle, elle se souvenait de son éducation, des façons aristocratiques avec lesquelles une grande dame doit montrer à des bourgeois qu’elle est heureuse de se trouver avec eux, qu’elle est sans morgue. Et le seul manque de véritable politesse qu’il y eût en elle était dans l’excès de ses politesses ; car on y reconnaissait ce pli professionnel d’une dame du faubourg Saint-Germain, laquelle, voyant toujours dans certains bourgeois les mécontents qu’elle est destinée à faire certains jours, profite avidement de toutes les occasions où il lui est possible, dans le livre de comptes de son amabilité avec eux, de prendre l’avance d’un solde créditeur, qui lui permettra prochainement d’inscrire à son débit le dîner ou le raout où elle ne les invitera pas. Ainsi, ayant agi jadis sur elle une fois pour toutes, et ignorant que maintenant les circonstances étaient autres, les personnes différentes et qu’à Paris elle souhaiterait de nous voir chez elle souvent, le génie de sa caste poussait avec une ardeur fiévreuse Mme de Villeparisis, comme si le temps qui lui était concédé pour être aimable était court, à multiplier avec nous, pendant que nous étions à Balbec, les envois de roses et de melons, les prêts de livres, les promenades en voiture et les effusions verbales. Et par là – tout autant que la splendeur aveuglante de la plage, que le flamboiement multicolore et les lueurs sous-océaniques des chambres, tout autant même que les leçons d’équitation par lesquelles des fils de commerçants étaient déifiés comme Alexandre de Macédoine – les amabilités quotidiennes de Mme de Villeparisis et aussi la facilité momentanée, estivale, avec laquelle ma grand’mère les acceptait, sont restées dans mon souvenir comme caractéristiques de la vie de bains de mer.","It was because in those moments she was not natural, she remembered her upbringing, the aristocratic ways in which a great lady must show bourgeois that she is happy to be with them, that she is without arrogance. And the only lack of real politeness there was in her was in the excess of her politeness; for one recognized in it that professional bent of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who, always seeing in certain bourgeois the discontent she is destined to make on certain days, avidly takes advantage of all the occasions when it is possible for her, in the account book for her friendliness with them, to take the advance of a credit balance, which will soon allow her to debit the dinner or the rout where she will not invite them. Thus, having once acted upon her once and for all, and ignorant that now the circumstances were different, the people different, and that in Paris she would like to see us at her house often, the genius of her caste urged Madame de Villeparisis, as if the time granted to him to be friendly were short, to multiply with us, while we were at Balbec, the shipments of roses and melons, the loans of books, the rides in the car and the verbal effusions. And thereby – as much as the blinding splendor of the beach, as the multicolored blaze and sub-oceanic glow of the chambers, as much even as the riding lessons by which sons of traders were deified like Alexander of Macedon – the Madame de Villeparisis' daily friendliness and also the momentary, summery ease with which my grandmother accepted them, have remained in my memory as characteristics of life at sea.","And indeed at such moments as this she was not natural, her mind reverted to her early training, to the aristocratic manner in which a great lady is supposed to shew common people that she is glad to see them, that she is not at all stiff. And her one and only failure in true politeness lay in this excess of politeness; which it was easy to identify as one of the professional 'wrinkles' of a lady of the Faubourg Saint–Germain, who, always seeing in her humbler friends the latent discontent that she must one day arouse in their bosoms, greedily seizes every opportunity en which she can possibly, in the ledger in which she keeps her social account with them, write down a credit balance which will allow her to enter presently on the opposite page the dinner or reception to which she will not invite them. And so, having long ago taken effect in her once and for all, and ignoring the fact that now both the circumstances and the people concerned were different, that in Paris she hoped to see us often come to her house, the spirit of her caste was urging Mme. de Villeparisis on with feverish ardour, and as if the time that was allowed her for being kind to us was limited, to multiply, while we were still at Balbec, her gifts of roses and melons, loans of books, drives in her carriage and verbal effusions. And for that reason, quite as much as the dazzling glories of the beach, the many–coloured flamboyance and subaqueous light of the rooms, as much even as the riding–lessons by which tradesmen's sons were deified like Alexander of Macedon, the daily kindnesses shewn us by Mme. de Villeparisis and also the unaccustomed, momentary, holiday ease with which my grandmother accepted them have remained in my memory as typical of life at a watering–place.","The fact was that, at such moments, her manner was not natural; it was her unforgotten upbringing which spoke, with its aristocratic ways, which a great lady must display so as to impress upon commoners that she is happy to be among them, that she does not look down on them. The only deficiency in Mme de Villeparisis’s politeness was the excess of it, for it could be seen as the professional mannerism of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who, accustomed as she is to seeing in certain middle-class people the malcontents whom she is bound to make of them sooner or later, takes full advantage while she can of any opportunities to have the account-ledger of her friendly relations with them record in advance a credit balance, so that when she is debited with not inviting them to her next dinner party or reception, it shall be without qualm. So, with a keen and irresistible earnestness, and as though there were little time left for her to show how considerate she was, the spirit of the caste to which Mme de Villeparisis belonged, having long since indelibly affected her, and in its ignorance of the fact that the circumstances were now different, the people not the same and that, once back in Paris, she would be glad of our frequent presence in her house, kept prompting her into lavishing upon us, for as long as our stay in Balbec lasted, bouquets of roses, melons, loans of books, outings in her carriage and many honeyed words. In this way, not only the dazzling beauty of the beach, the bedrooms with their many-hued radiance and suboceanic glints, and the riding lessons which turned the sons of shopkeepers into godlike Alexanders of Macedonia, but also each day’s friendly overtures from Mme de Villeparisis, and even the brief, summery ease with which my grandmother accepted them, all these survive in my memory as the typical redolences of a holiday by the sea."
"Je dus finir par obéir à ma grand-mère avec d’autant plus d’ennui qu’Elstir habitait assez loin de la digue, dans une des avenues les plus nouvelles de Balbec. La chaleur du jour m’obligea à prendre le tramway qui passait par la rue de la Plage, et je m’efforçais, pour penser que j’étais dans l’antique royaume des Cimmériens, dans la patrie peut-être du roi Mark ou sur l’emplacement de la forêt de Broceliande, de ne pas regarder le luxe de pacotille des constructions qui se développaient devant moi et entre lesquelles la villa d’Elstir était peut-être la plus somptueusement laide, louée malgré cela par lui, parce que de toutes celles qui existaient à Balbec, c’était la seule qui pouvait lui offrir un vaste atelier.","I had to end up obeying my grandmother with all the more annoyance since Elstir lived quite a distance from the dyke, in one of the newest avenues in Balbec. The heat of the day forced me to take the tramway which passed by the rue de la Plage, and I tried to think that I was in the ancient kingdom of the Cimmerians, in the homeland perhaps of King Mark or on the site of the forest of Broceliande, not to look at the shoddy luxury of the constructions which developed in front of me and between which the villa of Elstir was perhaps the most sumptuously ugly, rented in spite of that by him, because of all those that existed at Balbec, it was the only one that could offer him a large studio.","I was to end by complying with my grandmother's wishes, all the more reluctantly in that Elstir lived at some distance from the 'front' in one of the newest of Balbec's avenues. The heat of the day obliged me to take the tramway which passed along the Rue de la Plage, and I made an effort (so as still to believe that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the country it might be, of King Mark, or upon the site of the Forest of Broceliande) not to see the gimcrack splendour of the buildings that extended on either hand, among which Elstir's villa was perhaps the most sumptuously hideous, in spite of which he had taken it, because, of all that there were to be had at Balbec, it was the only one that provided him with a really big studio.","I eventually had to comply with my grandmother’s urgings, though I did so with a bad grace, which was aggravated by the fact that Elstir lived nowhere near the esplanade, but in one of the newest avenues of Balbec. The heat of the day made me take the tram along the rue de la Plage; and I sat there trying to imagine that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the land of King Mark or perhaps on the very spot where the Forest of Broceliande had been,87 so as to avoid looking at the sham luxury of the buildings all about me, among which Elstir’s villa was perhaps the most sumptuous in its ugliness, despite which he had rented it because it was the only one of all Balbec’s villas which afforded him the use of a spacious studio."
"Si cette sorte de vogue qu’avait obtenue Albertine ne paraissait devoir comporter aucun résultat pratique, elle avait imprimé à l’amie d’Andrée le caractère distinctif des êtres qui toujours recherchés n’ont jamais besoin de s’offrir (caractère qui se retrouve aussi, pour des raisons analogues, à une autre extrémité de la société, chez des femmes d’une grande élégance) et qui est de ne pas faire montre des succès qu’ils ont, de les cacher plutôt. Elle ne disait jamais de quelqu’un : « Il a envie de me voir », parlait de tous avec une grande bienveillance, et comme si ce fût elle qui eût couru après, recherché les autres. Si on parlait d’un jeune homme qui quelques minutes auparavant venait de lui faire en tête à tête les plus sanglants reproches parce qu’elle lui avait refusé un rendez-vous, bien loin de s’en vanter publiquement, ou de lui en vouloir à lui, elle faisait son éloge : « C’est un si gentil garçon ! » Elle était même ennuyée de tellement plaire, parce que cela l’obligeait à faire de la peine, tandis que, par nature, elle aimait à faire plaisir. Elle aimait même à faire plaisir au point d’en être arrivée à pratiquer un mensonge spécial à certaines personnes utilitaires, à certains hommes arrivés. Existant d’ailleurs à l’état embryonnaire chez un nombre énorme de personnes, ce genre d’insincérité consiste à ne pas savoir se contenter pour un seul acte, de faire, grâce à lui, plaisir à une seule personne. Par exemple, si la tante d’Albertine désirait que sa nièce l’accompagnât à une matinée peu amusante, Albertine en s’y rendant aurait pu trouver suffisant d’en tirer le profit moral d’avoir fait plaisir à sa tante. Mais accueillie gentiment par les maîtres de la maison, elle aimait mieux leur dire qu’elle désirait depuis si longtemps les voir qu’elle avait choisi cette occasion et sollicité la permission de sa tante. Cela ne suffisait pas encore : à cette matinée se trouvait une des amies d’Albertine qui avait un gros chagrin. Albertine lui disait : « Je n’ai pas voulu te laisser seule, j’ai pensé que ça te ferait du bien de m’avoir près de toi. Si tu veux que nous laissions la matinée, que nous allions ailleurs, je ferai ce que tu voudras, je désire avant tout te voir moins triste » (ce qui était vrai aussi du reste). Parfois il arrivait pourtant que le but fictif détruisait le but réel. Ainsi Albertine ayant un service à demander pour une de ses amies allait pour cela voir une certaine dame. Mais arrivée chez cette dame bonne et sympathique, la jeune fille obéissant à son insu au principe de l’utilisation multiple d’une seule action, trouvait plus affectueux d’avoir l’air d’être venue seulement à cause du plaisir qu’elle avait senti qu’elle éprouverait à revoir cette dame. Celle-ci était infiniment touchée qu’Albertine eût accompli un long trajet par pure amitié. En voyant la dame presque émue, Albertine l’aimait encore davantage. Seulement il arrivait ceci : elle éprouvait si vivement le plaisir d’amitié pour lequel elle avait prétendu mensongèrement être venue, qu’elle craignait de faire douter la dame de sentiments en réalité sincères, si elle lui demandait le service pour l’amie. La dame croirait qu’Albertine était venue pour cela, ce qui était vrai, mais elle conclurait qu’Albertine n’avait pas de plaisir désintéressé à la voir, ce qui était faux. De sorte qu’Albertine repartait sans avoir demandé le service, comme les hommes qui ont été si bons avec une femme dans l’espoir d’obtenir ses faveurs, qu’ils ne font pas leur déclaration pour garder à cette bonté un caractère de noblesse. Dans d’autres cas on ne peut pas dire que le véritable but fût sacrifié au but accessoire et imaginé après coup, mais le premier était tellement opposé au second, que si la personne qu’Albertine attendrissait en lui déclarant l’un avait appris l’autre, son plaisir se serait aussitôt changé en la peine la plus profonde. La suite du récit fera, beaucoup plus loin, mieux comprendre ce genre de contradictions. Disons par un exemple emprunté à un ordre de faits tout différents qu’elles sont très fréquentes dans les situations les plus diverses que présente la vie. Un mari a installé sa maîtresse dans la ville où il est en garnison. Sa femme restée à Paris, et à demi au courant de la vérité, se désole, écrit à son mari des lettres de jalousie. Or, la maîtresse est obligée de venir passer un jour à Paris. Le mari ne peut résister à ses prières de l’accompagner et obtient une permission de vingt-quatre heures. Mais comme il est bon et souffre de faire de la peine à sa femme, il arrive chez celle-ci, lui dit, en versant quelques larmes sincères, qu’affolé par ses lettres il a trouvé le moyen de s’échapper pour venir la consoler et l’embrasser. Il a trouvé ainsi le moyen de donner par un seul voyage une preuve d’amour à la fois à sa maîtresse et à sa femme. Mais si cette dernière apprenait pour quelle raison il est venu à Paris, sa joie se changerait sans doute en douleur, à moins que voir l’ingrat ne la rendît malgré tout plus heureuse qu’il ne la fait souffrir par ses mensonges. Parmi les hommes qui m’ont paru pratiquer avec le plus de suite le système des fins multiples se trouve M. de Norpois. Il acceptait quelquefois de s’entremettre entre deux amis brouillés, et cela faisait qu’on l’appelait le plus obligeant des hommes. Mais il ne lui suffisait pas d’avoir l’air de rendre service à celui qui était venu le solliciter, il présentait à l’autre la démarche qu’il faisait auprès de lui comme entreprise non à la requête du premier, mais dans l’intérêt du second, ce qu’il persuadait facilement à un interlocuteur suggestionné d’avance par l’idée qu’il avait devant lui « le plus serviable des hommes ». De cette façon, jouant sur les deux tableaux, faisant ce qu’on appelle en termes de coulisse de la contre-partie, il ne laissait jamais courir aucun risque à son influence, et les services qu’il rendait ne constituaient pas une aliénation, mais une fructification d’une partie de son crédit. D’autre part, chaque service, semblant doublement rendu, augmentait d’autant plus sa réputation d’ami serviable, et encore d’ami serviable avec efficacité, qui ne donne pas des coups d’épée dans l’eau, dont toutes les démarches portent, ce que démontrait la reconnaissance des deux intéressés. Cette duplicité dans l’obligeance était, et avec des démentis comme en toute créature humaine, une partie importante du caractère de M. de Norpois. Et souvent au ministère, il se servit de mon père, lequel était assez naïf, en lui faisant croire qu’il le servait.","If this kind of vogue that Albertine had obtained seemed to have no practical result, it had imprinted on Andrée's friend the distinctive character of beings who are always sought after and never need to offer themselves (a character that is found also, for analogous reasons, at another end of society, among women of great elegance) and which is not to show off the successes they have, rather to hide them. She never said of anyone: ""He wants to see me,"" spoke of everyone with great kindness, and as if it were she who had run after, sought out the others. If we were talking about a young man who a few minutes earlier had just made the bloodiest reproaches to her face to face because she had refused him a date, far from boasting about it publicly, or being angry with him to him, she praised him: ""He's such a nice boy!"" She was even annoyed at pleasing so much, because it forced her to cause pain, whereas, by nature, she liked to please. She even liked to please to the point of having come to practice a special lie to certain utilitarian people, to certain arrived men. Existing in an embryonic state in an enormous number of people, this kind of insincerity consists in not knowing how to be satisfied for a single act, to make, thanks to it, pleasure to a single person. For example, if Albertine's aunt wanted her niece to accompany her to an unamusing matinee, Albertine on going there might have found it sufficient to derive the moral benefit of having pleased her aunt. But received kindly by the masters of the house, she preferred to tell them that she had wanted to see them for so long that she had chosen this occasion and asked her aunt's permission. That was still not enough: that morning there was one of Albertine's friends who was very sad. Albertine said to her: “I didn’t want to leave you alone, I thought it would do you good to have me near you. If you want us to leave the morning and go somewhere else, I'll do what you want, above all I want to see you less sad” (which was also true for the rest). Sometimes it happened, however, that the fictitious goal destroyed the real goal. So Albertine, having a favor to ask for one of her friends, went to see a certain lady for the purpose. But arrived at this good and sympathetic lady, the young girl unwittingly obeying the principle of the multiple use of a single action, found it more affectionate to seem to have come only because of the pleasure she had sensed that it would be difficult to see this lady again. The latter was infinitely touched that Albertine had made a long journey out of pure friendship. Seeing the lady almost moved, Albertine loved her even more. Only this happened: she felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship for which she had falsely claimed to have come, that she was afraid of making the lady doubt that her feelings were really sincere, if she asked her to do the favor for the friend. The lady would believe that Albertine had come for this, which was true, but she would conclude that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was false. So that Albertine left without having asked for the service, like the men who have been so good to a woman in the hope of obtaining her favors, that they do not make their declaration in order to keep this kindness a character of nobility. . In other cases it cannot be said that the real goal was sacrificed to the accessory goal and imagined after the fact, but the first was so opposed to the second that if the person whom Albertine softened by declaring one to her had learned the Otherwise, his pleasure would have immediately changed into the deepest pain. The rest of the story will, much further, better understand this kind of contradictions. Let us say, by an example taken from an entirely different order of facts, that they are very frequent in the most diverse situations that life presents. A husband has installed his mistress in the city where he is stationed. His wife, who had remained in Paris, and half aware of the truth, was upset and wrote letters of jealousy to her husband. However, the mistress is obliged to come and spend a day in Paris. The husband cannot resist her pleas to accompany her and obtains twenty-four hour leave. But as he is good and suffers from hurting his wife, he arrives at her house, tells her, shedding a few sincere tears, that, terrified by her letters, he has found a way to escape to come to her. console and embrace him. He thus found the means of giving by a single trip a proof of love to both his mistress and his wife. But if the latter learned why he came to Paris, her joy would no doubt change into pain, unless seeing the ungrateful man made her happier in spite of everything than he made her suffer with his lies. Among the men who seemed to me to practice the system of multiple endings most consistently is M. de Norpois. He would sometimes agree to mediate between two estranged friends, and this caused him to be called the most obliging of men. But it was not enough for him to appear to be of service to the one who had come to solicit him, he presented to the other the approach he was making to him as a business not at the request of the first, but in the interest of the second, which he easily persuaded an interlocutor suggested in advance by the idea that he had before him ""the most helpful of men"". In this way, playing both sides, doing what is called in terms of the backstage of the counter-party, he never let his influence run any risk, and the services he rendered did not constitute alienation, but a fructification of part of his credit. On the other hand, each service, seemingly rendered twice, increased his reputation all the more as a helpful friend, and still as a helpful friend with efficiency, who does not throw his sword in the water, of which all the steps carry, which was demonstrated by the recognition of the two interested parties. This duplicity in obligingness was, and with denials as in every human creature, an important part of the character of M. de Norpois. And often in the ministry, he used my father, who was quite naive, by making him believe that he was serving him.","If this sort of select popularity to which Albertine had attained did not seem likely to lead to any practical result, it had stamped Andrée's friend with the distinctive marks of people who, being always sought after, have never any need to offer themselves, marks (to be found also, and for analogous reasons, at the other end of the social scale among the leaders of fashion) which consist in their not making any display of the successes they have scored, but rather keeping them to themselves. She would never say to anyone: ""So–and–so is anxious to meet me,"" would speak of everyone with the greatest good nature, and as if it had been she who ran after, who sought to know other people, and not they. If you spoke of a young man who, a few minutes earlier, had been, in private conversation with her, heaping the bitterest reproaches upon her because she had refused him an assignation, so far from proclaiming this in public, or betraying any resentment she would stand up for him: ""He is such a nice boy!"" Indeed it quite annoyed her when she attracted people, because that compelled her to disappoint them, whereas her natural instinct was always to give pleasure. So much did she enjoy giving pleasure that she had come to employ a particular kind of falsehood, found among utilitarians and men who have 'arrived.' Existing besides in an embryonic state in a vast number of people, this form of insincerity consists in not being able to confine the pleasure arising out of a single act of politeness to a single person. For instance, if Albertine's aunt wished her niece to accompany her to a party which was not very lively, Albertine might have found it sufficient to extract from the incident the moral profit of having given pleasure to her aunt. But being courteously welcomed by her host and hostess, she thought it better to say to them that she had been wanting to see them for so long that she had finally seized this opportunity and begged her aunt to take her to their party. Even this was not enough: at the same party there happened to be one of Albertine's friends who was in great distress. ""I did not like the idea of your being here by yourself. I thought it might do you good to have me with you. If you would rather come away from here, go somewhere else, I am ready to do anything you like; all I want is to see you look not so sad. ""—Which, as it happened, was true also. Sometimes it happened however that the fictitious object destroyed the real. Thus, Albertine, having a favour to ask on behalf of one of her friends, went on purpose to see a certain lady who could help her. But on arriving at the house of this lady—a kind and sympathetic soul—the girl, unconsciously following the principle of utilising a single action in a number of ways, felt it to be more ingratiating to appear to have come there solely on account of the pleasure she knew she would derive from seeing the lady again. The lady was deeply touched that Albertine should have taken a long journey purely out of friendship for herself. Seeing her almost overcome by emotion, Albertine began to like the lady still better. Only, there was this awkward consequence: she now felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship which she pretended to have been her motive in coming, that she was afraid of making the lady suspect the genuineness of sentiments which were actually quite sincere if she now asked her to do the favour, whatever it may have been, for her friend. The lady would think that Albertine had come for that purpose, which was true, but would conclude also that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was not. With the result that she came away without having asked the favour, like a man sometimes who has been so good to a woman, in the hope of winning her, that he refrains from declaring his passion in order to preserve for his goodness an air of nobility. In other instances it would be wrong to say that the true object was sacrificed to the subordinate and subsequently conceived idea, but the two were so far incompatible that if the person to whom Albertine endeared herself by stating the second had known of the existence of the first, his pleasure would at once have been turned into the deepest annoyance. At a much later point in this story, we shall have occasion to see this kind of incompatibility expressed in clearer terms. Let us say for the present, borrowing an example of a completely different order, that they occur very frequently in the most divergent situations that life has to offer. A husband has established his mistress in the town where he is quartered with his regiment. His wife, left by herself in Paris, and with an inkling of the truth, grows more and more miserable, and writes her husband letters embittered by jealousy. Very well; the mistress is obliged to go up to Paris for the day. The husband cannot resist her entreaties that he will go with her, and applies for short leave, which is granted. But as he is a good–natured fellow, and hates to make his wife unhappy, he goes to her and tells her, shedding a few quite genuine tears, that, driven to desperation by her letters, he has found the means of getting away from his duties to come to her, to console her in his arms. He has thus contrived by a single journey to furnish wife and mistress alike with proofs of his affection. But if the wife were to learn the reason for which he has come to Paris, her joy would doubtless be turned into grief, unless her pleasure in seeing the faithless wretch outweighed, in spite of everything, the pain that his infidelities had caused her. Among the men who have struck me as practising with most perseverance this system of what might be called killing any number of birds with one stone, must be included M. de Norpois. He would now and then agree to act as intermediary between two of his friends who had quarrelled, which led to his being called the most obliging of men. But it was not sufficient for him to appear to be doing a service to the friend who had come to him to demand it; he would represent to the other the steps which he was taking to effect a reconciliation as undertaken not at the request of the first friend but in the interest of the second, an attitude of the sincerity of which he had never any difficulty in convincing a listener already influenced by the idea that he saw before him the 'most serviceable of men.' In this fashion, playing in two scenes turn about, what in stage parlance is called 'doubling' two parts, he never allowed his influence to be in the slightest degree imperilled, and the services which he rendered constituted not an expenditure of capital but a dividend upon some part of his credit. At the same time every service, seemingly rendered twice over, correspondingly enhanced his reputation as an obliging friend, and, better still, a friend whose interventions were efficacious, one who did not draw bows at a venture, whose efforts were always justified by success, as was shewn by the gratitude of both parties. This duplicity in rendering services was—allowing for disappointments such as are the lot of every human being—an important element of M. de Norpois's character. And often at the Ministry he would make use of my father, who was a simple soul, while making him believe that it was he, M. de Norpois, who was being useful to my father.","Albertine’s general popularity, though it seemed unlikely to lead to any advantageous consequence, had ingrained in her the distinguishing characteristic of those who, by being always sought after, never need to make overtures (a trait which can be found, for similar reasons, in another remoter region of society, among the great ladies of the fashionable world), and who, rather than boasting of their successes, tend to conceal them. She would never have said of someone, ‘He’s dying to see me’; and she spoke of everybody with great good-will, giving the impression that she was the one seeking out others, trying to be liked by them. If one alluded to a young fellow who had just been cruelly berating her for not wishing to see him again, Albertine would sing his praises (‘Such a nice chap!’) instead of priding herself publicly on a conquest, or bearing him a grudge. In fact, she was put out by being so well liked, because it meant that she sometimes had to be unpleasant to people; whereas her natural inclination was to be pleasant. This inclination had even led her to adopt a form of lying, which is peculiar to people who like to be useful, or the type of man who has come up in the world. This mode of insincerity, which exists in embryo in a great many people, consists in the inability to be satisfied with the pleasure that can be given to a single person by a single act. If, for example, Albertine’s aunt required her attendance at a boring reception, she did not think that in the gratification she afforded her aunt by going to it there was enough moral benefit to herself. So her response to the kindly welcome of their hosts was to assure them that, having been looking forward to meeting them for a long time , she had begged her aunt to let her come on this occasion. Even this struck her as insufficient; and if she came across one of her friends at the reception, someone who had reason to be heartbroken, Albertine would say, ‘I didn’t like to think of you being on your own, so I thought you might like me to keep you company. Perhaps you’d prefer us to leave and go somewhere else? I’ll do whatever you like – I’d give anything for you not to be so sad’ (which was, of course, quite true). However, there were times when the fictitious purpose destroyed the real purpose: on one occasion, she called on a particular lady, with the intention of asking her to do a favour for a friend; but at the sight of this warm-hearted lady, Albertine, responding all unawares to her own principle of the multifarious usefulness of the single act, thought it would be nicer if she could appear to have had no other reason for visiting the lady than the enjoyment she expected from her company. The lady was extremely touched to think that Albertine had come such a long way on an impulse of simple friendship. Albertine, seeing how affected the lady was, responded with an even stronger fondness for her. The trouble was, though, that she was herself so keenly affected by the friendliness which she had falsely said was her reason for being there that she was reluctant to ask the favour for the friend, in case the lady should doubt the sincerity of her feelings (which were in fact quite sincere). The lady might believe that the favour was Albertine’s real reason for coming, which was true; but then she would assume that Albertine had no real pleasure in seeing her, which was untrue. The upshot was that Albertine would return home without having asked the favour, after the manner of those men who, having done a good turn to a woman in the hope of having their way with her, then keep their desire for her to themselves, so as to preserve a semblance of selflessness. On other occasions, it could not be said that the true purpose was sacrificed to the subsidiary one invented on the spur of the moment; but the real one was at such variance with the ostensible one that, had the person who was so touched by hearing the latter learned the former, all pleasure would instantly have been turned into a shock of mortification. Such contradictions will be clarified, eventually, by the rest of my story. They are, however, very prevalent, in even the most diverse circumstances of life, as can be shown by an example deriving from a very different order of experience. A married man brings his mistress down to live in the town where he is garrisoned. His wife, who is still in Paris, half-aware of how things stand, frets and broods, and pours her jealousy into letters to the husband. A moment comes when the mistress is obliged to go back to Paris for a day. Her lover finds her pleas that he should accompany her irresistible, and arranges to take twenty-four hours’ leave. Then, because he is a good-hearted fellow and is sorry for the pain he causes his wife, he goes round to see her and says, with the help of a few sincere tears, that her letters have so disturbed him that he managed to get away, so as to bring her consolation and a kiss. He has thus contrived, with a single journey, to prove his love both to the mistress and to the wife. But if the wife should find out the real reason why he came back to Paris, her joy would no doubt turn to pain, unless of course the pleasure of being with the miscreant should outweigh the sorrow of knowing him for a liar. One of the men who seemed to me to be most diligent in applying this principle of the plurality of purposes was M. de Norpois. He had been known to step in and act as an intermediary between two friends who had fallen out; and for this he was seen as the most obliging of men. But he was not satisfied just to seem to be helping out the one who had come to ask his advice: when speaking to the other party, he would present his intervention, not as resulting from a request by the first friend, but as being in the interest of the second; and this he had little difficulty in doing, faced with a man whose mind was already prepared to believe he was dealing with ‘the most helpful of men’. In this way, by hedging his bets, operating ‘against’ his client, as the parlance of the outside-brokers has it, he never jeopardized his influence; the services he rendered never had the effect of compromising his credit, but always of partly enriching it. Also, each of these services, seemingly doubly rendered, enhanced in that same measure his reputation as a dependable friend, and an effectively dependable friend at that, one whose aim is true, whose every stroke counts, as was attested by the gratitude of the two assisted parties. Such duplicity in obligingness (not unbelied at times, as in all human creatures) made up a significant element of the character of M. de Norpois. At the Ministry, he often made use of my father, who was rather a guileless man, while letting him think he was being of use to him."
"– Mon Dieu… c’est une maison où il me semble que vont surtout… des messieurs. Il y avait quelques hommes mariés, mais leurs femmes étaient souffrantes ce soir-là et n’étaient pas venues, répondit l’Ambassadeur avec une finesse voilée de bonhomie et en jetant autour de lui des regards dont la douceur et la discrétion faisaient mine de tempérer et exagéraient habilement la malice.","– My God… it seems to me that it is a house where mostly… gentlemen go. There were a few married men, but their wives were ill that evening and hadn't come, replied the Ambassador with a subtlety veiled in good-nature, casting around him glances whose gentleness and discretion temper and skilfully exaggerate the malice.","""Why, my dear lady, it is a house which (or so it struck me) is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,"" replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good–humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice.","‘Well now …, to tell you the truth … I must say it’s a house at which most of the guests appear to be … gentlemen. There were certainly several married men present – but their wives were all indisposed yesterday evening, and had been unable to go,’ the ambassador replied, with a crafty glance masked by joviality, his eyes full of a demure discretion that pretended to moderate their mischievousness while making it more obvious."
"Sauf à ces moments d’involontaire fléchissement où Swann essayait de retrouver la mélancolique cadence botticellienne, le corps d’Odette était maintenant découpé en une seule silhouette cernée tout entière par une « ligne » qui, pour suivre le contour de la femme, avait abandonné les chemins accidentés, les rentrants et les sortants factices, les lacis, l’éparpillement composite des modes d’autrefois, mais qui aussi, là où c’était l’anatomie qui se trompait en faisant des détours inutiles en deçà ou au delà du tracé idéal, savait rectifier d’un trait hardi les écarts de la nature, suppléer, pour toute une partie du parcours, aux défaillances aussi bien de la chair que des étoffes. Les coussins, le « strapontin » de l’affreuse « tournure » avaient disparu ainsi que ces corsages à basques qui, dépassant la jupe et raidis par des baleines, avaient ajouté si longtemps à Odette un ventre postiche et lui avaient donné l’air d’être composée de pièces disparates qu’aucune individualité ne reliait. La verticale des « effilés » et la courbe des ruches avaient cédé la place à l’inflexion d’un corps qui faisait palpiter la soie comme la sirène bat l’onde et donnait à la percaline une expression humaine, maintenant qu’il s’était dégagé, comme une forme organisée et vivante, du long chaos et de l’enveloppement nébuleux des modes détrônées. Mais Mme Swann cependant avait voulu, avait su garder un vestige de certaines d’entre elles, au milieu même de celles qui les avaient remplacées. Quand le soir, ne pouvant travailler et étant assuré que Gilberte était au théâtre avec des amies, j’allais à l’improviste chez ses parents, je trouvais souvent Mme Swann dans quelque élégant déshabillé dont la jupe, d’un de ces beaux tons sombres, rouge foncé ou orange, qui avaient l’air d’avoir une signification particulière parce qu’ils n’étaient plus à la mode, était obliquement traversée d’une rampe ajourée et large de dentelle noire qui faisait penser aux volants d’autrefois. Quand par un jour encore froid de printemps elle m’avait, avant ma brouille avec sa fille, emmené au Jardin d’Acclimatation, sous sa veste qu’elle entr’ouvrait plus ou moins selon qu’elle se réchauffait en marchant, le « dépassant » en dents de scie de sa chemisette avait l’air du revers entrevu de quelque gilet absent, pareil à l’un de ceux qu’elle avait portés quelques années plus tôt et dont elle aimait que les bords eussent ce léger déchiquetage ; et sa cravate – de cet « écossais » auquel elle était restée fidèle, mais en adoucissant tellement les tons (le rouge devenu rose et le bleu lilas) que l’on aurait presque cru à un de ces taffetas gorge de pigeon qui étaient la dernière nouveauté – était nouée de telle façon sous son menton, sans qu’on pût voir où elle était attachée, qu’on pensait invinciblement à ces « brides » de chapeaux qui ne se portaient plus. Pour peu qu’elle sût « durer » encore quelque temps ainsi, les jeunes gens, essayant de comprendre ses toilettes, diraient : « Madame Swann, n’est-ce pas, c’est toute une époque ? » Comme dans un beau style qui superpose des formes différentes et que fortifie une tradition cachée, dans la toilette de Mme Swann, ces souvenirs incertains de gilets, ou de boucles, parfois une tendance aussitôt réprimée au « saute en barque », et jusqu’à une allusion lointaine et vague au « suivez-moi jeune homme », faisaient circuler sous la forme concrète la ressemblance inachevée d’autres plus anciennes qu’on n’aurait pu y trouver effectivement réalisées par la couturière ou la modiste, mais auxquelles on pensait sans cesse, et enveloppaient Mme Swann de quelque chose de noble – peut-être parce que l’inutilité même de ces atours faisait qu’ils semblaient répondre à un but plus qu’utilitaire, peut-être à cause du vestige conservé des années passées, ou encore d’une sorte d’individualité vestimentaire, particulière à cette femme et qui donnait à ses mises les plus différentes un même air de famille. On sentait qu’elle ne s’habillait pas seulement pour la commodité ou la parure de son corps ; elle était entourée de sa toilette comme de l’appareil délicat et spiritualisé d’une civilisation.","Except for those moments of involuntary decline when Swann tried to rediscover the melancholy Botticelli rhythm, Odette's body was now cut into a single silhouette surrounded entirely by a ""line"" which, to follow the outline of the woman, had abandoned the uneven paths, the artificial entrances and exits, the maze, the composite scattering of the fashions of yesteryear, but which also, where it was the anatomy that made mistakes by making useless detours on this side or beyond the ideal layout, knew how to rectify with a bold line the deviations of nature, to compensate, for a whole part of the course, for the deficiencies as well of the flesh as of the fabrics. The cushions, the ""folding seat"" of the hideous ""turn"" had disappeared, as had those bodices with peplums which, protruding from the skirt and stiffened by stays, had for so long added to Odette a false belly and had given her the air of a woman. to be composed of disparate pieces that no individuality connected. The vertical of the ""tapered"" and the curve of the frills had given way to the inflection of a body which made the silk quiver like the siren beats the wave and gave the percaline a human expression, now that it is was freed, like an organized and living form, from the long chaos and the nebulous envelopment of dethroned fashions. But Madame Swann, however, had wanted, had been able to keep a vestige of some of them, in the very midst of those who had replaced them. When in the evening, unable to work and being sure that Gilberte was at the theater with friends, I went unexpectedly to her parents', I often found Madame Swann in some elegant negligee whose skirt, in one of those beautiful tones dark, deep red or orange, which seemed to have a special meaning because they were no longer fashionable, was crossed obliquely by a wide, openwork ramp of black lace which made one think of the flounces of in the old days. When on a day that was still cold in spring, before my falling out with her daughter, she had taken me to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, under her jacket which she opened more or less depending on whether she was warming herself while walking, the "" protruding in sawtooth from her blouse looked like the glimpsed lapel of some absent waistcoat, like one of those she had worn a few years earlier and whose edges she liked to have this slight raggedness; and her tie – of that “Scottish” to which she had remained faithful, but softening the tones so much (the red turned pink and the blue lilac) that one would have almost thought it was one of those pigeon-groove taffetas that were the last novelty – was tied in such a way under his chin, without it being possible to see where it was attached, that one thought invincibly of those “bridles” of hats which were no longer worn. If she knew how to “last” for a while longer in this way, young people, trying to understand her clothes, would say: “Madame Swann, isn’t it, it’s a whole era? As in a beautiful style which superimposes different shapes and which fortifies a hidden tradition, in Madame Swann's toilet, these uncertain memories of waistcoats, or buckles, sometimes an immediately suppressed tendency to ""jump into the boat"", and even to a distant and vague allusion to the ""follow me young man"", circulated in concrete form the unfinished resemblance of other older ones that one could not have found there actually made by the seamstress or the milliner, but to which one thought incessantly, and enveloped Madame Swann in something noble – perhaps because the very uselessness of these attires made them seem to serve a more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the vestige preserved from the years past, or even of a sort of sartorial individuality, particular to this woman and which gave her most different outfits the same family resemblance. One could sense that she did not dress only for convenience or adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her toilet like the delicate and spiritualized apparatus of a civilization.","Save at these moments of involuntary relaxation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re–entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element. The pads, the preposterous 'bustle' had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood–red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me (before my rupture with her daughter) to the Jardin d'Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm, the dog–toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non–existent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf—of that same 'Scotch tartan' to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon's–breast taffetas which were the latest novelty—was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one's being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet–strings which were—now no longer worn. She need only 'hold out' like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: ""Mme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn't she?"" As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann's attire those half–hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the 'all aboard,' or even a distant and vague allusion to the 'chase me' kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility—perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady's wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation.","Except at such yielding moments of unselfconscious languor, when Swann could hope to catch a glimpse of Botticelli’s melancholy attitudes, Odette’s body was now blocked out as a single profile, a unitary shape which took its outline from the woman within and ignored the former fashions with their fussy broken lines, the artificiality of their protrusions and indentations, their jutting angles and criss-crossings, their composite effect of disparate complexity, but which could also, if that anatomy within erred and made unwanted departures from the ideal design, correct these mistakes of nature with a firm stroke, redrawing whole sections of the contour so as to make good any deficiencies, whether of flesh or cloth. All the padding, the appalling ‘dress-improvers’ and bustles, had gone; as had the long vest bodices which for so many years, overlapping the skirt and rigid with whalebone, had added a false abdomen to Odette and made her look like a creature of separate parts unlinked by any individuality. The vertical fringes of jet and the stiff curves of the ruches had been replaced by the suppleness of a body which, having freed itself like an independent and organized life-form from the long opacity and chrysaloid chaos of the outworn modes, now rippled silk as a mermaid ripples water and gave a human look to the gloss of percaline. Mme Swann had managed to retain a vestige of some of these modes, amid the others which had replaced them. Some evenings, when I was unable to work, and when I was quite sure that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with a party of friends, I would call unannounced at her parents’ house, where I was often greeted by Mme Swann in one of her handsome house-dresses, the skirt of which, in one of those magnificent dark shades, a deep red or orange, which seemed to have a special meaning because they were no longer fashionable, showed through a broad diagonal panel of black lace reminiscent of an outmoded flounce. Before Gilberte and I had fallen out, on one of those wintry spring days when Mme Swann had taken me to the Zoo in the Bois de Boulogne, the indented edging of her blouse, under the jacket which she would unbutton a little as the walk warmed her up, had looked just like the absent lapel of the vest bodices she had once worn and which she always preferred with such a slight zigzag edge; and she had been wearing a necklet (in a tartan pattern which she had never abandoned, though she had by now so toned down its colours, the red having shaded into pink and the blue into lilac, that it could almost have been taken for one of those dove-coloured taffetas which had just come in) knotted in a bow under the chin in a way that, because one could not see how it was fastened, instantly reminded one of those hats with long bands tied round the throat which nobody now wore. Before very long, young men, trying to define her ways of dressing, would be saying to each other, ‘Mme Swann is a real period-piece, you know!’ In her ways of dressing, as in a fine written style which embraces different forms of expression and is enriched by a concealed tradition, these semi-reminiscences of bodices and bows, an occasional instantly repressed hint of the ‘monkey-jacket’, and even a faint whisper of an allusion to long ‘follow-me-lads’ hat-ribbons, filled the actual forms of what she did wear with a constant unformed suggestion of older ones, which no real seamstress or milliner could have contrived, but which hung about her all the time, surrounding her with something noble – possibly because the very uselessness of these trappings made them appear designed for a more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the remnant they preserved of former times, or even because of a kind of individuality in dress, peculiar to herself, which gave to what she wore, however dissimilar her ensembles, a sort of family resemblance. One could sense that, for her, dressing was not just a matter of comfort or adornment of the body: whatever she wore encompassed her like the delicate and etherealized epitome of a civilization."
"Pendant ce temps, je songeais à la petite feuille de bloc-notes que m’avait passée Albertine : « Je vous aime bien », et une heure plus tard, tout en descendant les chemins qui ramenaient, un peu trop à pic à mon gré, vers Balbec, je me disais que c’était avec elle que j’aurais mon roman.","During this time, I was thinking of the little notepad sheet that Albertine had passed to me: ""I like you,"" and an hour later, while descending the paths which led back, a little too steeply for my , towards Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my novel.","Meanwhile I had been thinking of the little page torn from a scribbling block which Albertine had handed me. ""I love you,"" she had written. And an hour later, as I scrambled down the paths which led back, a little too vertically for my liking, to Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my romance.","I had been thinking about Albertine’s little slip of paper torn from the note-pad: I like you; and an hour later, climbing down the paths back to Balbec, a little too steep for my liking, I was thinking she was the one who would be the great love of my life."

"– Je vous parlais de Carquethuit, me dit-il, avant que je l’eusse quitté à sa porte. J’ai fait une petite esquisse où on voit bien mieux la cernure de la plage. Le tableau n’est pas trop mal, mais c’est autre chose. Si vous le permettez, en souvenir de notre amitié, je vous donnerai mon esquisse, ajouta-t-il, car les gens qui vous refusent les choses qu’on désire vous en donnent d’autres.","“I was telling you about Carquethuit,” he said to me, before I left him at his door. I made a small sketch where you can see the rim of the beach much better. The picture isn't too bad, but that's something else. If you allow me, in remembrance of our friendship, I will give you my sketch, he added, for people who refuse you the things you want give you other things.","""We were speaking just now of Carquethuit,"" he began, as we walked towards his villa. ""I have done a little sketch, in which you can see much better how the beach curves. The painting is not bad, but it is different. If you will allow me, just to cement our friendship, I would like to give you the sketch,"" he went on, for the people who refuse us the objects of our desire are always ready to offer us something else.","‘I was talking to you about Carquethuit, he said, before I left him at his front door. I once did a little sketch which catches much better the neat loop of the shore-line. The painting’s not bad, but it’s not the same thing. If you like, I could give you the sketch, as a memento of our friendship,’ he added, for the people who decline to give you the things you desire give you other things."
"– Mais comment, je suis ravie, cela m’enchante, répondait son amie avec un sourire câlin, en filant les sons sur un ton mélodieux, qui contrastait avec sa simplicité coutumière.","- But how, I'm delighted, I'm delighted, replied her friend with a cuddly smile, spinning the sounds in a melodious tone, which contrasted with her usual simplicity.","Why, I am delighted, what could be nicer? "" replied her friend with a winning smile, drawing out, almost intoning her words in a way that contrasted markedly with her customary simplicity of speech.","– Not at all, I’m delighted. I find it quite charming,’ her old friend replied, with a winning smile, and descanting on a mellifluous note which contrasted with her customary plainness of speech."
"J’avais ajouté ces derniers mots par scrupule et pour ne pas avoir l’air de m’être vanté d’une relation que je n’avais pas. Mais en les prononçant, je sentais qu’ils étaient déjà devenus inutiles, car dès le début de mon remerciement, d’une ardeur réfrigérante, j’avais vu passer sur le visage de l’Ambassadeur une expression d’hésitation et de mécontentement, et dans ses yeux ce regard vertical, étroit et oblique (comme, dans le dessin en perspective d’un solide, la ligne fuyante d’une de ses faces), regard qui s’adresse à cet interlocuteur invisible qu’on a en soi-même, au moment où on lui dit quelque chose que l’autre interlocuteur, le Monsieur avec qui on parlait jusqu’ici – moi dans la circonstance – ne doit pas entendre. Je me rendis compte aussitôt que ces phrases que j’avais prononcées et qui, faibles encore auprès de l’effusion reconnaissante dont j’étais envahi, m’avaient paru devoir toucher M. de Norpois et achever de le décider à une intervention qui lui eût donné si peu de peine, et à moi tant de joie, étaient peut-être (entre toutes celles qu’eussent pu chercher diaboliquement des personnes qui m’eussent voulu du mal) les seules qui pussent avoir pour résultat de l’y faire renoncer. En les entendant en effet, de même qu’au moment où un inconnu, avec qui nous venions d’échanger agréablement des impressions que nous avions pu croire semblables sur des passants que nous nous accordions à trouver vulgaires, nous montre tout à coup l’abîme pathologique qui le sépare de nous en ajoutant négligemment tout en tâtant sa poche : « C’est malheureux que je n’aie pas mon revolver, il n’en serait pas resté un seul », M. de Norpois qui savait que rien n’était moins précieux ni plus aisé que d’être recommandé à Mme Swann et introduit chez elle, et qui vit que pour moi, au contraire, cela présentait un tel prix, par conséquent, sans doute, une grande difficulté, pensa que le désir, normal en apparence, que j’avais exprimé, devait dissimuler quelque pensée différente, quelque visée suspecte, quelque faute antérieure, à cause de quoi, dans la certitude de déplaire à Mme Swann, personne n’avait jusqu’ici voulu se charger de lui transmettre une commission de ma part. Et je compris que cette commission, il ne la ferait jamais, qu’il pourrait voir Mme Swann quotidiennement pendant des années, sans pour cela lui parler une seule fois de moi. Il lui demanda cependant quelques jours plus tard un renseignement que je désirais et chargea mon père de me le transmettre. Mais il n’avait pas cru devoir dire pour qui il le demandait. Elle n’apprendrait donc pas que je connaissais M. de Norpois et que je souhaitais tant d’aller chez elle ; et ce fut peut-être un malheur moins grand que je ne croyais. Car la seconde de ces nouvelles n’eût probablement pas beaucoup ajouté à l’efficacité, d’ailleurs incertaine, de la première. Pour Odette, l’idée de sa propre vie et de sa demeure n’éveillant aucun trouble mystérieux, une personne qui la connaissait, qui allait chez elle, ne lui semblait pas un être fabuleux comme il le paraissait à moi qui aurais jeté dans les fenêtres de Swann une pierre si j’avais pu écrire sur elle que je connaissais M. de Norpois : j’étais persuadé qu’un tel message, même transmis d’une façon aussi brutale, m’eût donné beaucoup plus de prestige aux yeux de la maîtresse de la maison qu’il ne l’eût indisposée contre moi. Mais, même si j’avais pu me rendre compte que la mission dont ne s’acquitta pas M. de Norpois fût restée sans utilité, bien plus, qu’elle eût pu me nuire auprès des Swann, je n’aurais pas eu le courage, s’il s’était montré consentant, d’en décharger l’Ambassadeur et de renoncer à la volupté, si funestes qu’en pussent être les suites, que mon nom et ma personne se trouvassent ainsi un moment auprès de Gilberte, dans sa maison et sa vie inconnues.","I had added those last words out of scruple and so as not to sound like I was bragging about a relationship I didn't have. But in uttering them, I felt that they had already become useless, for from the beginning of my thanks, with a chilling ardor, I had seen an expression of hesitation and discontent pass over the Ambassador's face, and in his eyes this vertical, narrow and oblique gaze (like, in the perspective drawing of a solid, the receding line of one of its faces), a gaze that is addressed to this invisible interlocutor that one has within oneself -even, when we say something to him that the other interlocutor, the gentleman with whom we spoke until now – me in the circumstances – must not hear. I immediately realized that these phrases which I had uttered and which, still feeble compared to the grateful effusion with which I was overwhelmed, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and complete the decision to persuade him to intervene which would would have given me so little trouble, and to me so much joy, were perhaps (among all those that people who would have wished me harm could have diabolically sought) the only ones that could have had the result of doing it there. to renouncer. Hearing them, in fact, just as when a stranger, with whom we had just pleasantly exchanged impressions which we might have thought similar about passers-by whom we agreed to find vulgar, suddenly showed us the pathological abyss that separates him from us, adding negligently while feeling his pocket: ""It's unfortunate that I don't have my revolver, there wouldn't have been a single one left"", M. de Norpois who knew that nothing less precious nor easier than to be recommended to Madame Swann and introduced to her house, and who saw that for me, on the contrary, it presented such a price, consequently, no doubt, a great difficulty, thought that the desire , normal in appearance, that I had expressed, must have concealed some different thought, some suspicious intention, some previous fault, because of which, in the certainty of displeasing Madame Swann, no one had hitherto wanted to take charge of send him a commission from me. And I understood that he would never carry out this commission, that he could see Madame Swann daily for years, without on that account speaking to her once about me. However, he asked him a few days later for some information that I wanted and instructed my father to pass it on to me. But he had not thought it necessary to say for whom he was asking it. She would therefore not learn that I knew M. de Norpois and that I wanted so much to go to her house; and it was perhaps a lesser misfortune than I thought. For the second of these novellas would probably not have added much to the effectiveness, moreover uncertain, of the first. For Odette, the idea of her own life and her home did not arouse any mysterious disturbance, a person who knew her, who went to her house, did not seem to her a fabulous being as he seemed to me who would have thrown into the Swann's windows a stone if I had been able to write about it that I knew M. de Norpois: I was convinced that such a message, even transmitted in such a brutal way, would have given me much more prestige in the eyes of of the mistress of the house that he would not have indisposed her against me. But, even if I had been able to realize that the mission which M. de Norpois did not carry out had remained useless, even more, that it could have harmed me with the Swanns, I would not have had the Courage, if he had shown himself consenting, to relieve the Ambassador of it and to renounce voluptuousness, however disastrous the consequences might be, that my name and my person thus found themselves for a moment with Gilberte, in his unknown home and life.","I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look (like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces), that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one's other audience, the person whom one has been addressing—myself, in this instance—is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps (out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons anxious to do me harm) the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging—quite pleasantly—our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers–by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: ""What a pity, I haven't got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!"" M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had expressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre–existent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann's windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure—however fatal its consequences might prove—of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte's presence, in her unknown life and home.","This final statement I added only out of a punctilious concern not to be thought to be boasting improperly of an acquaintance to which I could lay no claim. But even as I spoke the words, I could sense there was now no purpose for them to serve. The warmth of my thanks was so chilling in its effect that, from the first syllable, I caught a glimpse of hesitancy and annoyance flitting across the ambassador’s face, and saw in his eyes that cramped, vertical, averted expression (like the obliquely receding line of one side of a figure, in a projection) meant for the invisible listener one carries within, and to whom one addresses a remark that one’s other listener, the person one has been talking to – in this case, me – is not supposed to catch. I realized at once that the words I had uttered, quite inadequate as they were to express the huge rush of gratitude that swept through me, and though it had seemed to me they could not fail to touch M. de Norpois, and must succeed in persuading him to act in a way which would afford him so little trouble while affording me so much joy, were perhaps the very ones (among all the potentially evil words that might have been spoken by people wishing to harm me) which would make him decide not to. And just as when a stranger with whom we have been agreeably exchanging what appear to be shared opinions on passers-by, who we both think are vulgar, suddenly shows the real pathological distance separating us by patting his pocket and saying casually, ‘Mmm, pity I didn’t bring my revolver with me – I could have picked ’em all off,’ so, when he heard me speak these words, M. de Norpois, knowing that nothing was easier or less prized than to be recommended to Mme Swann and to join her circle, but seeing also that for me this represented something of such value that it must be assumed to be out of my reach, decided that the seemingly unexceptionable wish which I had expressed must actually conceal some quite different ulterior motive, a dubious intent or the memory of a faux pas, which must be the reason why no one had ever wished to offend Mme Swann by undertaking to put in a word for me. I realized then that M. de Norpois would never put in such a word, that even if he saw Mme Swann daily for years on end, he would never once mention my name in her hearing. However, a few days after this he did find out from her some information I had asked for and passed it on to me via my father. He had not seen fit to tell her on whose behalf he was seeking the information. She would therefore not learn that I was acquainted with M. de Norpois or that I longed to visit her house. This was perhaps less of a disaster than I thought; for even if she had learned of this longing, it would probably have done little to increase the effect of my being acquainted with M. de Norpois, as this acquaintance was itself of doubtful benefit to me. Since the notion of her own life and house caused no mysterious agitation in Odette’s heart, she did not see the people of her acquaintance, the people who visited her house, as the fabulous beings they were to one who, like me, would have been glad to throw a stone through the Swanns’ front window, if only I could have written on it that I knew M. de Norpois – I was sure that such a message, even if delivered in such a startling fashion, would do more to recommend me to the lady of the house than it would to prejudice her against me. But even if I had been able to comprehend that M. de Norpois’s unaccomplished mission would in any event have been useless, or that it might actually have biassed the Swanns against me, even if M. de Norpois had been willing to comply with my request, I would never have had the courage to withdraw it and forgo the ecstasy, however baneful its consequences might be for me, of knowing that my name and person were, just for a moment, in the presence of Gilberte, inside her unknown house and life."
"Pour remonter à un temps plus ancien, la modestie et l’honnêteté qui donnaient souvent de la noblesse au visage de notre vieille servante ayant gagné les vêtements que, en femme réservée mais sans bassesse, qui sait « tenir son rang et garder sa place », elle avait revêtus pour le voyage afin d’être digne d’être vue avec nous sans avoir l’air de chercher à se faire voir, – Françoise, dans le drap cerise mais passé de son manteau et les poils sans rudesse de son collet de fourrure, faisait penser à quelqu’une de ces images d’Anne de Bretagne peintes dans des livres d’Heures par un vieux maître, et dans lesquelles tout est si bien en place, le sentiment de l’ensemble s’est si également répandu dans toutes les parties que la riche et désuète singularité du costume exprime la même gravité pieuse que les yeux, les lèvres et les mains.","To go back to a more ancient time, the modesty and the honesty which often gave nobility to the face of our old servant having won the clothes that, as a reserved woman but without baseness, who knows how to ""hold her rank and keep her place"" , she had dressed for the trip in order to be worthy of being seen with us without seeming to try to be seen, – Françoise, in the cherry cloth but gone from her coat and the hairs without roughness of her collar of fur, reminded one of those pictures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, and in which everything is so well in place, the feeling of the whole is so evenly prevalent in all parts that the rich and antiquated singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands.","To take a parallel from an earlier age, the modesty and integrity which often gave an air of nobility to the face of our old servant having spread also to the garments which, as a woman reserved but not humbled, who knew how to hold her own and to keep her place, she had put on for the journey so as to be fit to be seen in our company without at the same time seeming or wishing to make herself conspicuous,—Françoise in the cherry–coloured cloth, now faded, of her cloak, and the discreet nap of her fur collar, brought to mind one of those miniatures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, in which everything is so exactly in the right place, the sense of the whole is so evenly distributed throughout the parts that the rich and obsolete singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands.","Or to go further back in time, the nobility often given to the face of our old servant by modesty and honesty had spread to the clothes which, like the retiring person she was, a woman quite devoid of base instincts but ‘knowing her place’, she had chosen for this journey, so as to be worthy of being seen with us while not appearing to be attracting attention to herself; and Françoise, in the faded cerise material of her overcoat and the uniform pile of her fur collar, called to mind one of those depictions of Anne of Brittany painted by an old master in a book of hours,4 in which everything is so aptly matched, the feeling of the whole so evenly shared among all the parts, that the rich quaintness of the costume expresses the same pious solemnity as the eyes, the lips and the hands."
"Swann avait dans sa chambre, au lieu des belles photographies qu’on faisait maintenant de sa femme, et où la même expression énigmatique et victorieuse laissait reconnaître, quels que fussent la robe et le chapeau, sa silhouette et son visage triomphants, un petit daguerréotype ancien tout simple, antérieur à ce type, et duquel la jeunesse et la beauté d’Odette, non encore trouvées par elle, semblaient absentes. Mais sans doute Swann, fidèle ou revenu à une conception différente, goûtait-il dans la jeune femme grêle aux yeux pensifs, aux traits las, à l’attitude suspendue entre la marche et l’immobilité, une grâce plus botticellienne. Il aimait encore en effet à voir en sa femme un Botticelli. Odette qui au contraire cherchait non à faire ressortir, mais à compenser, à dissimuler ce qui, en elle-même, ne lui plaisait pas, ce qui était peut-être, pour un artiste, son « caractère », mais que, comme femme, elle trouvait des défauts, ne voulait pas entendre parler de ce peintre. Swann possédait une merveilleuse écharpe orientale, bleue et rose, qu’il avait achetée parce que c’était exactement celle de la Vierge du Magnificat. Mais Mme Swann ne voulait pas la porter. Une fois seulement elle laissa son mari lui commander une toilette toute criblée de pâquerettes, de bluets, de myosotis et de campanules d’après la Primavera du Printemps. Parfois, le soir, quand elle était fatiguée, il me faisait remarquer tout bas comme elle donnait sans s’en rendre compte à ses mains pensives le mouvement délié, un peu tourmenté de la Vierge qui trempe sa plume dans l’encrier que lui tend l’ange, avant d’écrire sur le livre saint où est déjà tracé le mot Magnificat. Mais il ajoutait : « Surtout ne le lui dites pas, il suffirait qu’elle le sût pour qu’elle fît autrement. »","Swann had in his room, instead of the beautiful photographs that were now made of his wife, and where the same enigmatic and victorious expression revealed, whatever the dress and the hat, her triumphant figure and face, a small daguerreotype quite simple, older than this type, and from which Odette's youth and beauty, not yet found by her, seemed absent. But no doubt Swann, faithful or returned to a different conception, he tasted in the slender young woman with thoughtful eyes, with weary features, in an attitude suspended between walking and immobility, a more Botticellian grace. He still liked to see in his wife a Botticelli. Odette who, on the contrary, sought not to bring out, but to compensate, to conceal what, in herself, she did not like, what was perhaps, for an artist, her ""character"", but that, as a woman , she found faults, did not want to hear about this painter. Swann had a marvelous oriental scarf, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that of the Virgin of the Magnificat. But Madame Swann didn't want to wear it. Only once did she allow her husband to order her a toilette riddled with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and bellflowers after the Primavera du Printemps. Sometimes, in the evening, when she was tired, he made me notice in a low voice how, without realizing it, she gave her pensive hands the slender, slightly tormented movement of the Virgin who dips her quill in the inkwell held out to her. the angel, before writing on the holy book where the word Magnificat is already written. But he added: ""Above all, don't tell her, it would be enough for her to know it for her to do otherwise."" »","Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious expression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli's figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist express her 'character' but in her woman's eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget–me–nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word ""Magnificat."" But he added, ""Whatever you do, don't say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.""","In Swann’s own bedroom, instead of the grand photographs taken nowadays of his wife, in which, however unalike her different hats and dresses were, the same enigmatically imperious expression identified her triumphant figure and features, he kept a modest little old daguerreotype dating from the days before this unvarying model of Odette’s, in which she seemed devoid of her new youth and beauty, as yet undiscovered by her. In this no doubt he clung, or had reverted, to a different conception of her, doting for ever on the Botticellian graces of a slender young woman with pensive eyes and a forlorn look, caught in a posture between stride and stillness. The fact was he could still see her as a Botticelli. Odette herself, who always tried to conceal things she did not like about her own person, or at least to compensate for them, rather than bring them out, things which a painter might have seen as her ‘type’, but which as a woman she saw as defects, had no time for Botticelli. Swann owned a wonderful Oriental stole, in blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly the one worn by the Virgin in the Magnificat. Mme Swann would not wear it. Once only, she relented and let him give her an outfit based on la Primavera’s garlands of daisies, bellworts, cornflowers and forget-me-nots. In the evenings, Swann would sometimes murmur to me to look at her pensive hands as she gave to them unawares the graceful, rather agitated movement of the Virgin dipping her quill in the angel’s inkwell, before writing in the holy book where the word Magnificat is already inscribed. Then he would add, ‘Be sure not to mention it to her! One word – and she’d make sure it wouldn’t happen again!’"
"– Précisément, me dit-il tout à coup comme si la cause était jugée et après m’avoir laissé bafouiller en face des yeux immobiles qui ne me quittaient pas un instant, j’ai le fils d’un de mes amis qui, mutatis mutandis, est comme vous (et il prit pour parler de nos dispositions communes le même ton rassurant que si elles avaient été des dispositions non pas à la littérature, mais au rhumatisme et s’il avait voulu me montrer qu’on n’en mourait pas). Aussi a-t-il préféré quitter le quai d’Orsay où la voie lui était pourtant toute tracée par son père et, sans se soucier du qu’en dira-t-on, il s’est mis à produire. Il n’a certes pas lieu de s’en repentir. Il a publié il y a deux ans – il est d’ailleurs beaucoup plus âgé que vous, naturellement – un ouvrage relatif au sentiment de l’Infini sur la rive occidentale du lac Victoria-Nyanza et cette année un opuscule moins important, mais conduit d’une plume alerte, parfois même acérée, sur le fusil à répétition dans l’armée bulgare, qui l’ont mis tout à fait hors de pair. Il a déjà fait un joli chemin, il n’est pas homme à s’arrêter en route, et je sais que, sans que l’idée d’une candidature ait été envisagée, on a laissé tomber son nom deux ou trois dans la conversation, et d’une façon qui n’avait rien de défavorable, à l’Académie des Sciences morales. En somme, sans pouvoir dire encore qu’il soit au pinacle, il a conquis de haute lutte une fort jolie position et le succès qui ne va pas toujours qu’aux agités et aux brouillons, aux faiseurs d’embarras qui sont presque toujours des faiseurs, le succès a récompensé son effort.","“Precisely,” he said to me suddenly, as if the case had been judged, and after letting me stammer in front of the motionless eyes that never left me for a moment, I have the son of one of my friends who, mutatis mutandis, is like you (and he took on the same reassuring tone to speak of our common dispositions as if they had been dispositions not for literature, but for rheumatism and if he had wanted to show me that one did not die of it not). So he preferred to leave the Quai d'Orsay where the path was all traced for him by his father and, without worrying about what people will say, he began to produce. There is certainly no reason to regret this. He published two years ago - he is much older than you, of course - a work relating to the feeling of the Infinite on the western shore of Lake Victoria-Nyanza and this year a less important booklet, but led of an alert, sometimes even sharp pen on the repeating rifle in the Bulgarian army, which set him quite apart. He has already come a long way, he is not one to stop on the way, and I know that, without the idea of a candidacy having been considered, his name was dropped two or three times in the conversation, and in a way that had nothing unfavorable about it, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. In short, without being able to say yet that he is at the pinnacle, he has conquered a very fine position and the success which does not always go only to the agitated and the rough, to the embarrassers who are almost always makers, success rewarded his effort.","""Precisely;"" he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. ""There is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours."" He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. "" He too has chosen to leave the Quai d'Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he's had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago—of course, he's much older than you, you understand—a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He's gone pretty far already, and he's not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that (without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election) his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can't say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success—which doesn't always come only to agitators and mischief–makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take—success has crowned his efforts.""","‘Quite,’ he said suddenly, as though the matter was closed, having let me flounder about under his unmoving stare. ‘I know of the case of the son of a friend of mine who, mutatis mutandis, is just like you.’ (His tone, as he spoke of our shared hankerings after the writing life, was reassuring, as though we had a predisposition towards rheumatism rather than literature, and he wanted me to know it was not fatal.) ‘So, he preferred to leave the Quai d’Orsay, despite the fact that, thanks to his father, his career path was clear, and then, without caring so much as a fig for any views which others might have on the matter, he started to publish. He is not likely to repine at having done so, believe you me. Two years ago now he wrote a book – he’s a fair bit older than yourself, of course – on the Sentiment of the Infinite on the western shore of Lake Victoria-Nyanza, and then this very year a work of lesser scope, but still written with a nimble, nay sometimes a sharp nib, on the repeating rifle in the Bulgarian army, and these two productions have really put him in a class all his own. So he has already gone a fair way. He’s not a man to do things by halves, and I can assure you that, though no firm nomination of him for the Académie des sciences morales is yet being envisaged, his name has cropped up once or twice in conversation, and that in a manner which was far from disadvantageous to him. In a word, though it would be untrue to say he has yet scaled the highest peak, it must be said that, by dint of meritorious endeavour, he has contrived to make a pretty fine position for himself, and that his worthy efforts have been duly crowned by success – for success, you know, does not always go to the muddle-pates and scatter-brains of this world, nor indeed to the upsetters of apple-carts, who usually turn out to be in it for show, anyway.’"
"À un point de vue plus accessoire, la façon spéciale, un peu trop minutieuse et intense, qu’il avait de prononcer certains mots, certains adjectifs qui revenaient souvent dans sa conversation et qu’il ne disait pas sans une certaine emphase, faisant ressortir toutes leurs syllabes et chanter la dernière (comme pour le mot « visage » qu’il substituait toujours au mot « figure » et à qui il ajoutait un grand nombre de v, d’s, de g, qui semblaient tous exploser de sa main ouverte à ces moments) correspondait exactement à la belle place où dans sa prose il mettait ces mots aimés en lumière, précédés d’une sorte de marge et composés de telle façon, dans le nombre total de la phrase, qu’on était obligé, sous peine de faire une faute de mesure, d’y faire compter toute leur « quantité ». Pourtant, on ne retrouvait pas dans le langage de Bergotte certain éclairage qui dans ses livres comme dans ceux de quelques autres auteurs modifie souvent dans la phrase écrite l’apparence des mots. C’est sans doute qu’il vient de grandes profondeurs et n’amène pas ses rayons jusqu’à nos paroles dans les heures où, ouverts aux autres par la conversation, nous sommes dans une certaine mesure fermés à nous-même. À cet égard il y avait plus d’intonations, plus d’accent, dans ses livres que dans ses propos ; accent indépendant de la beauté du style, que l’auteur lui-même n’a pas perçu sans doute, car il n’est pas séparable de sa personnalité la plus intime. C’est cet accent qui, aux moments où, dans ses livres, Bergotte était entièrement naturel, rythmait les mots souvent alors fort insignifiants qu’il écrivait. Cet accent n’est pas noté dans le texte, rien ne l’y indique et pourtant il s’ajoute de lui-même aux phrases, on ne peut pas les dire autrement, il est ce qu’il y avait de plus éphémère et pourtant de plus profond chez l’écrivain, et c’est cela qui portera témoignage sur sa nature, qui dira si malgré toutes les duretés qu’il a exprimées il était doux, malgré toutes les sensualités, sentimental.","From a more incidental point of view, the special way, a little too meticulous and intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which often came up in his conversation and which he did not say without a certain emphasis, bringing out all their syllables and sing the last (as with the word ""face"" which he always substituted for the word ""figure"" and to which he added a large number of v's, d's, g's, which all seemed to explode from his open hand at these moments) corresponded exactly to the beautiful place where in his prose he highlighted these beloved words, preceded by a kind of margin and composed in such a way, in the total number of the sentence, that one was obliged, under penalty to make a measurement error, to make count all their ""quantity"". However, one did not find in the language of Bergotte certain lighting which in his books as in those of some other authors often modifies in the written sentence the appearance of the words. It is undoubtedly that it comes from great depths and does not bring its rays to our words in the hours when, open to others through conversation, we are to a certain extent closed to ourselves. In this respect there was more intonation, more accent, in his books than in his words; accent independent of the beauty of the style, which the author himself doubtless did not perceive, since it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It is this accent which, at the times when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave rhythm to the often very insignificant words he wrote. This accent is not noted in the text, nothing indicates it and yet it adds itself to the sentences, they cannot be said otherwise, it is what was most ephemeral and yet deeper in the writer, and this is what will bear witness to his nature, who will say whether despite all the harshness he expressed he was gentle, despite all the sensualities, sentimental.","From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable (as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v's and s's and g's, which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments) corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words—often at such times quite insignificant—that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases , one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature , what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental.","A more superficial thing, the special, intense and more than punctilious pronunciation he used with certain words, certain adjectives which often recurred in his conversation, and which he slightly overemphasized, bringing out every single syllable and making the stressed one ring (as in the word ‘visage’ which he invariably used instead of ‘face’, cramming it with extra vs, ss and gs, all of which seemed to burst out of his gesturing hand as he spoke them) was the exact correlative of those fine and special places in his prose where he would set such favoured words, which were always preceded by a sort of margin, and so precisely designed within the sentence’s intricate balance that, so as to avoid spoiling the rhythm of it, one was obliged to give each of them its full quantity. However, in Bergotte’s spoken words there was no sign of that particular lighting which in his books, as in the books of some other writers, often alters the appearance of words in a written sentence. That form of light comes no doubt from great depths, and its rays cannot reach our words at those times when, by being open to others through conversation, we are partly closed to ourselves. In that sense, one could hear in his books more intonations and more accent than in his speech; for this is an accent which is unrelated to the beauty of a style, which a writer himself may not even have noticed, as it is inseparable from his most private self. This was the accent which always marked its rhythm in the words Bergotte wrote when he was being entirely natural, however insignificant in themselves these words might be. It is an accent which is marked by no sign on the page, indicated by nothing in the text; and yet it clings to the sentences, which cannot be spoken in any other way; it was the most ephemeral but the most profound thing in the writer, the thing which will bear definitive witness to his nature, which will enable one to tell whether, despite all the harsh things he uttered, he was a gentle man, whether despite all the sensuality, he was a man of sentiment."

"L’égocentrisme permettant de la sorte à chaque humain de voir l’univers étagé au-dessous de lui qui est roi, M. Bloch se donnait le luxe d’en être un impitoyable quand le matin en prenant son chocolat, voyant la signature de Bergotte au bas d’un article dans le journal à peine entr’ouvert, il lui accordait dédaigneusement une audience écourtée, prononçait sa sentence, et s’octroyait le confortable plaisir de répéter entre chaque gorgée du breuvage bouillant : « Ce Bergotte est devenu illisible.

"Nous apercevions déjà l’hôtel, ses lumières si hostiles le premier soir, à l’arrivée, maintenant protectrices et douces, annonciatrices du foyer. Et quand la voiture arrivait près de la porte, le concierge, les grooms, le lift, empressés, naïfs, vaguement inquiets de notre retard, massés sur les degrés à nous attendre, étaient devenus familiers, de ces êtres qui changent tant de fois au cours de notre vie, comme nous changeons nous-mêmes, mais dans lesquels, au moment où ils sont pour un temps le miroir de nos habitudes, nous trouvons de la douceur à nous sentir fidèlement et amicalement reflétés. Nous les préférons à des amis que nous n’avons pas vus depuis longtemps, car ils contiennent davantage de ce que nous sommes actuellement. Seul « le chasseur », exposé au soleil dans la journée, avait été rentré pour ne pas supporter la rigueur du soir, et emmailloté de lainages, lesquels, joints à l’éplorement orangé de sa chevelure et à la fleur curieusement rose de ses joues, faisaient, au milieu du hall vitré, penser à une plante de serre qu’on protège contre le froid. Nous descendions de voiture, aidés par beaucoup plus de serviteurs qu’il n’était nécessaire, mais ils sentaient l’importance de la scène et se croyaient obligés d’y jouer un rôle. J’étais affamé. Aussi, souvent pour ne pas retarder le moment de dîner, je ne remontais pas dans la chambre qui avait fini par devenir si réellement mienne que revoir les grands rideaux violets et les bibliothèques basses, c’était me retrouver seul avec ce moi-même dont les choses, comme les gens, m’offraient l’image, et nous attendions tous ensemble dans le hall que le maître d’hôtel vînt nous dire que nous étions servis. C’était encore l’occasion pour nous d’écouter Mme de Villeparisis.","We could already see the hotel, its lights so hostile the first evening, on arrival, now protective and soft, harbingers of the home. And when the car arrived near the door, the concierge, the bellboys, the lift, eager, naive, vaguely worried about our delay, huddled together on the steps waiting for us, had become familiar with those beings who change so many times in the morning. course of our life, as we ourselves change, but in which, while they are for a time the mirror of our habits, we find sweetness in feeling ourselves faithfully and amicably reflected. We prefer them to friends we haven't seen in a long time, because they contain more of who we currently are. Only ""the hunter"", exposed to the sun during the day, had been brought inside so as not to endure the rigors of the evening, and swaddled in woolen clothes, which, together with the orange weeping of his hair and the curiously pink flower of his cheeks , made, in the middle of the glazed hall, think of a greenhouse plant that is protected against the cold. We got out of the car, helped by many more servants than was necessary, but they felt the importance of the scene and felt obliged to play a part in it. I was starving. Also, often so as not to delay the moment of dinner, I did not go back up to the room which had ended up becoming so truly mine that to see again the large purple curtains and the low bookcases was to find myself alone with this myself whose things, like people, offered me the image, and we all waited together in the hall for the maitre d' to come and tell us that we had been served. It was another opportunity for us to listen to Madame de Villeparisis.","We had now come in sight of the hotel, with its lights, so hostile that first evening, on our arrival, now protecting and kind, speaking to us of home. And when the carriage drew up outside the door, the porter, the pages, the lift–boy, attentive, clumsy, vaguely uneasy at our lateness, were numbered, now that they had grown familiar, among those beings who change so many times in the course of our life, as we ourself change, but by whom, when they are for the time being the mirror of our habits, we find something attractive in the feeling that we are being faithfully reflected and in a friendly spirit. We prefer them to friends whom we have not seen for some time, for they contain more of what we actually are. Only the outside page, exposed to the sun all day, had been taken indoors for protection from the cold night air and swaddled in thick woollen garments which, combined with the orange effulgence of his locks and the curiously red bloom of his cheeks, made one, seeing him there through the glass front of the hall, think of a hot–house plant muffled up for protection from the frost. We got out of the carriage, with the help of a great many more servants than were required, but they were conscious of the importance of the scene and each felt obliged to take some part in it. I was always very hungry. And so, often, so as not to keep dinner waiting, I would not go upstairs first to the room which had succeeded in becoming so really mine that to catch sight of its long violet curtains and low bookcases was to find myself alone again with that self of which things, like people, gave me a reflected image; but we would all wait together in the hall until the head waiter came to tell us that our dinner was ready. And this gave us another opportunity of listening to Mme. de Villeparisis.","The hotel was now within sight, its lights, which had been so unfriendly on the evening of our arrival, now glowing with the gentle reassurance and promise of a homecoming. As our carriage neared the door, the doorman, the pageboys and the ‘lift’, standing in a body on the front steps, looking out for us, eager and ingenuous, slightly worried by our lateness, now that they too had become familiar to us, were examples of those in whom, though they change so often during our lifetime, as we ourselves change, we are soothed to see, for as long as they serve as our temporary mirrors, the faithful and friendly reflection of our habits. We prefer them to friends whom we have not set eyes on for ages, for they contain more of what we are at the moment. So as to be spared the rigours of the evening air, the outside page, having been exposed to the sunlight all day long, had been taken inside and wrapped in woollens, which among all the glass of the vestibule, along with the forlorn orangey foliage of his hair and the peculiar rose-pink of his cheeks, made one think of a hothouse plant being protected from the cold. We would get out of the carriage, assisted by many more retainers than necessary; but they had sensed the significance of the scene, and felt it incumbent upon them to play a part in it. As I was usually famished, rather than postpone the start of dinner, I chose not to go up to my room (which had so genuinely become mine that to stand among its long violet curtains and low book-cases was to be alone with that self which saw its own image in furnishings, as in people); and so all three of us stayed in the vestibule, waiting for the head waiter to come and tell us that dinner was served. This gave us another opportunity to attend to Mme de Villeparisis."
"– J’ai supporté longtemps sa terrible fausseté, me dit-elle, sa bassesse, les innombrables crasses qu’elle m’a faites. J’ai tout supporté à cause des autres. Mais le dernier trait a tout fait déborder. Et elle me raconta un potin qu’avait fait cette jeune fille et qui, en effet, pouvait nuire à Andrée.","“I put up with her terrible falsity for a long time,” she told me, “her baseness, the innumerable filth she has done to me. I endured everything because of others. But the last line made everything overflow. And she told me a gossip that this young girl had made and which, in fact, could harm Andrée.","""I have put up far too long with her terrible dishonesty,"" she explained to me, ""her baseness; I can't tell you all the vile insults she has heaped on me. I have stood it all because of the others. But her latest effort was really too much!"" And she told me of some foolish thing that this girl had done, which might indeed have injurious consequences to Andrée herself.","‘I’ve put up with her awful dishonesty for ages, Andrée told me, her nastiness, all the dirty tricks she’s played on me! I’ve put up with it all for the sake of the others. But the latest bad turn she’s done me is really the last straw.’ She told me something the girl had said against her, which could indeed have had serious consequences for Andrée."
"Il ne faut, d’ailleurs, pas croire que ce malentendu fut momentané comme ceux qui se forment au deuxième acte d’un vaudeville pour se dissiper au dernier. Mme de Luxembourg, nièce du roi d’Angleterre et de l’empereur d’Autriche, et Mme de Villeparisis parurent toujours, quand la première venait chercher la seconde pour se promener en voiture, deux drôlesses de l’espèce de celles dont on se gare difficilement dans les villes d’eaux. Les trois quarts des hommes du faubourg Saint-Germain passent aux yeux d’une bonne partie de la bourgeoisie pour des décavés crapuleux (qu’ils sont d’ailleurs quelquefois individuellement) et que, par conséquent, personne ne reçoit. La bourgeoisie est trop honnête en cela, car leurs tares ne les empêcheraient nullement d’être reçus avec la plus grande faveur là où elle ne le sera jamais. Et eux s’imaginent tellement que la bourgeoisie le sait qu’ils affectent une simplicité en ce qui les concerne, un dénigrement pour leurs amis particulièrement « à la côte », qui achève le malentendu. Si par hasard un homme du grand monde est en rapports avec la petite bourgeoisie parce qu’il se trouve, étant extrêmement riche, avoir la présidence des plus importantes sociétés financières, la bourgeoisie qui voit enfin un noble digne d’être grand bourgeois jurerait qu’il ne fraye pas avec le marquis joueur et ruiné qu’elle croit d’autant plus dénué de relations qu’il est plus aimable. Et elle n’en revient pas quand le duc, président du conseil d’administration de la colossale Affaire, donne pour femme à son fils la fille du marquis joueur, mais dont le nom est le plus ancien de France, de même qu’un souverain fera plutôt épouser à son fils la fille d’un roi détrôné que d’un président de la république en fonctions. C’est dire que les deux mondes ont l’un de l’autre une vue aussi chimérique que les habitants d’une plage située à une des extrémités de la baie de Balbec ont de la plage située à l’autre extrémité : de Rivebelle on voit un peu Marcouville l’Orgueilleuse ; mais cela même trompe, car on croit qu’on est vu de Marcouville d’où au contraire les splendeurs de Rivebelle sont en grande partie invisibles.","It should not, moreover, be believed that this misunderstanding was momentary like those which are formed in the second act of a vaudeville to dissipate in the last. Madame de Luxembourg, niece of the King of England and the Emperor of Austria, and Madame de Villeparisis always appeared, when the former came to fetch the latter for a ride in the carriage, two wags of the kind one usually thinks of. parks with difficulty in the water towns. Three-quarters of the men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain are considered by a good part of the bourgeoisie to be villainous (which they are, moreover, sometimes individually) and whom, consequently, no one receives. The bourgeoisie is too honest in this, because their flaws would in no way prevent them from being received with the greatest favor where it never will be. And they imagine themselves so much that the bourgeoisie knows it that they affect a simplicity in what concerns them, a denigration for their friends who are particularly ""on the coast"", which completes the misunderstanding. If by chance a man of the high world is in contact with the petty bourgeoisie because he happens, being extremely rich, to have the presidency of the most important financial companies, the bourgeoisie which finally sees a noble worthy of being a grand bourgeois would swear that he does not consort with the gambler and ruined marquis whom she believes to be all the more devoid of relations the more amiable he is. And she can't believe it when the duke, president of the board of directors of the colossal affair, gives his son the daughter of the gambler marquis, but whose name is the oldest in France, as well as a sovereign would rather have his son marry the daughter of a dethroned king than of a president of the republic in office. This means that the two worlds have as chimerical a view of each other as the inhabitants of a beach located at one end of the bay of Balbec have of the beach located at the other end: of Rivebelle we see a little Marcouville l'Orgueilleuse; but even that is misleading, because it is believed that one is seen from Marcouville where, on the contrary, the splendours of Rivebelle are largely invisible.","It must not, however, be supposed that this misunderstanding was merely temporary, like those that occur in the second act of a farce to be cleared up before the final curtain. Mme. de Luxembourg, a niece of the King of England and of the Emperor of Austria, and Mme. de Villeparisis, when one called to take the other for a drive, did look like nothing but two 'old trots' of the kind one has always such difficulty in avoiding at a watering place. Nine tenths of the men of the Faubourg Saint–Germain appear to the average man of the middle class simply as alcoholic wasters (which, individually, they not infrequently are) whom, therefore, no respectable person would dream of asking to dinner. The middle class fixes its standard, in this respect, too high, for the feelings of these men would never prevent their being received with every mark of esteem in houses which it, the middle class, may never enter. And so sincerely do they believe that the middle class knows this that they affect a simplicity in speaking of their own affairs and a tone of disparagement of their friends, especially when they are 'at the coast,' which make the misunderstanding complete. If, by any chance, a man of the fashionable world is kept in touch with 'business people' because, having more money than he knows what to do with, he finds himself elected chairman of all sorts of important financial concerns, the business man who at last sees a nobleman worthy, he considers, to rank with 'big business,' would take his oath that such a man can have no dealings with the Marquis ruined by gambling whom the said business man supposes to be all the more destitute of friends the more friendly he makes himself. And he cannot get over his surprise when the Duke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the colossal undertaking, arranges a marriage for his son with the daughter of that very Marquis, who may be a gambler but who bears the oldest name in France, just as a Sovereign would sooner see his son marry the daughter of a dethroned King than that of a President still in office. That is to say, the two worlds take as fantastic! a view of one another as the inhabitants of a town situated at one end of Balbec Bay have of the town at the other end: from Rivebelle you can just see Marcouville l'Orgueilleuse; but even that is deceptive, for you imagine that you are seen from Marcouville, where, as a matter of fact, the splendours of Rive–belle are almost wholly invisible. Part II Place-names The Place (Continued)","It should not be thought that this was a misunderstanding of short duration, like those which arise in the second act of a musical comedy and are resolved in the final scene. Whenever the Princess of Luxembourg, who was a niece of the King of England and the Emperor of Austria, came to fetch Mme de Villeparisis so that they could take carriage-exercise together, they could not help looking like a pair of retired demi-reps, of the sort whom it is difficult to avoid in fashionable resorts. Three-quarters of the gentlemen who belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain are looked down on by many middle-class people as impecunious debauchees and wastrels (which of course some of them may well be) whom no honest man could mix with. In this, the middle class is too moral, as the defects of these gentlemen would never prevent them from being welcomed with open arms in places where it will never be. The gentlemen in turn are so convinced that the middle class is aware of this that they affect a straightforward attitude towards their own doings, even going so far as to disapprove of those of their associates who are most hard-up; and this only reinforces the misunderstanding. If by some chance a gentleman from the Faubourg, whose great wealth happens to qualify him to be a director of the leading banking houses, has to mix with members of the lower middle classes, the latter, seeing for once a noble they think worthy of being one of themselves, are convinced that he would have nothing to do with a gambling bankrupt of a marquis, who they think, especially because he is such a likeable man, must be quite out of favour with his class. They are taken aback when the duke who is the managing director of the enormous enterprise marries his son to the daughter of the gambling marquis, who happens to bear a name which is that of the oldest family in France, just as a sovereign will prefer to be father-in-law to the daughter of an erstwhile king rather than to the daughter of a present president of the Republic. This means that the view which the two worlds have of each other is as imaginary as the view which one seaside town has of another when they stand at opposite ends of the Bay of Balbec: from Rivebelle, it is just possible to see a little of Marcouville-l’Orgueilleuse; but that misleads Rivebelle into thinking its delights are visible from Marcouville, when they are more or less invisible."
"– Notre mise en présence, à Bergotte et à moi, ajouta-t-il en se tournant vers mon père, ne laissait pas que d’être assez épineuse (ce qui après tout est aussi une manière d’être piquante). Bergotte, voilà quelques années de cela, fit un voyage à Vienne, pendant que j’y étais ambassadeur ; il me fut présenté par la princesse de Metternich, vint s’inscrire et désirait être invité. Or, étant à l’étranger représentant de la France, à qui en somme il fait honneur par ses écrits, dans une certaine mesure, disons, pour être exacts, dans une mesure bien faible, j’aurais passé sur la triste opinion que j’ai de sa vie privée. Mais il ne voyageait pas seul et bien plus il prétendait ne pas être invité sans sa compagne. Je crois ne pas être plus pudibond qu’un autre et, étant célibataire, je pouvais peut-être ouvrir un peu plus largement les portes de l’Ambassade que si j’eusse été marié et père de famille. Néanmoins, j’avoue qu’il y a un degré d’ignominie dont je ne saurais m’accommoder, et qui est rendu plus écœurant encore par le ton plus que moral, tranchons le mot, moralisateur, que prend Bergotte dans ses livres où on ne voit qu’analyses perpétuelles et d’ailleurs, entre nous, un peu languissantes, de scrupules douloureux, de remords maladifs, et pour de simples peccadilles, de véritables prêchi-prêcha (on sait ce qu’en vaut l’aune) alors qu’il montre tant d’inconscience et de cynisme dans sa vie privée. Bref, j’éludai la réponse, la princesse revint à la charge, mais sans plus de succès. De sorte que je ne suppose pas que je doive être très en odeur de sainteté auprès du personnage, et je ne sais pas jusqu’à quel point il a apprécié l’attention de Swann de l’inviter en même temps que moi. À moins que ce ne soit lui qui l’ait demandé. On ne peut pas savoir, car au fond c’est un malade. C’est même sa seule excuse.","“Our coming together, Bergotte and myself,” he added, turning to my father, “was not only to be rather thorny (which after all is also a way of being piquant). Bergotte, some years ago, made a trip to Vienna while I was ambassador there; He was introduced to me by the Princess of Metternich, came to register and wanted to be invited. Now, being the representative of France abroad, to whom, in short, he does honor by his writings, to a certain extent, let us say, to be exact, to a very small extent, I would have overlooked the sad opinion that I I have his private life. But he was not traveling alone and much more he pretended not to be invited without his companion. I believe I am no more prudish than anyone else and, being single, I could perhaps open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and a father. Nevertheless, I admit that there is a degree of ignominy which I could not put up with, and which is made even more sickening by the more than moral tone, let us cut the word, moralizer, that Bergotte takes in his books where we only see perpetual analyzes and moreover, between us, a little languid, painful scruples, sickly remorse, and for simple peccadilloes, real sermons (we know what the yardstick is worth) when he shows so much recklessness and cynicism in his private life. In short, I evaded the answer, the princess returned to the charge, but without more success. So I don't suppose I have to be very holy to the character, and I don't know how much he appreciated Swann's attention to invite him along with me. Unless he asked for it. We cannot know, because deep down he is sick. It's even his only excuse.","""Our first introduction—I speak of Bergotte and myself——"" he resumed, turning to my father, ""was somewhat beset with thorns (which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points). Bergotte—some years ago, now—paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and expected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain extent (let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight extent), I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely—let us be quite frank and say moralising,—that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses (as one knows from one's own experience), while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann's kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole excuse.""","‘The bringing together of Bergotte and myself, M. de Norpois said to my father, did have its potentially prickly side – though even prickles, of course, may tickle the fancy, if I may say so. You see, some years back, during my time as ambassador in Vienna, Bergotte turned up there on his travels. He was introduced to me by the Princess Metternich, subsequently signed the book at the embassy and let it be known that he wished to be invited to the ambassador’s table. Now, I being the representative abroad of France, and he being a man whose writings do honour in some measure to our country (to be quite accurate, an inconsiderable measure), I should have been quite prepared to forget the poor opinion I have formed of his private life. However, he was not travelling alone; and what’s more, he insisted on not being invited without his … travelling companion. I believe I can honestly lay claim to being no more of a prude than the next man; and being a bachelor, I might have been able to open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been a husband and father. None the less, I avouch that there is a degree of ignominy at which I draw the line, and which is made even more revolting by the high moral tone, or rather the frankly moralistic tone, which he adopts in print. For the books are just chock-full of incessant analysis (which, between you and me, is actually quite sickly), with agonizing scruples and morbid remorse and a veritable deluge of preachifying over the merest peccadilloes – and we all know what that’s worth! – when all the time, in his private life, the man behaves with the most out-and-out cynicism and lack of conscience. So, to cut a long story short, I did not commit myself. And when the Princess gave me a reminder about it, she got no more satisfaction. With the result that I must suppose I am in no very good odour with the gentleman in question; and I can only wonder whether he greatly appreciated Swann’s delicacy in inviting him and myself at the same time – unless, of course, it was Bergotte himself who suggested it. No way of knowing, though, as the man’s ill. That’s the real explanation – indeed, it’s his only excuse."
"Sauf ces jours de pluie, comme nous devions aller en bicyclette sur la falaise ou dans la campagne, une heure d’avance je cherchais à me faire beau et gémissais si Françoise n’avait pas bien préparé mes affaires. Or, même à Paris, elle redressait fièrement et rageusement sa taille que l’âge commençait à courber, pour peu qu’on la trouvât en faute, elle humble, elle modeste et charmante quand son amour-propre était flatté. Comme il était le grand ressort de sa vie, la satisfaction et la bonne humeur de Françoise étaient en proportion directe de la difficulté des choses qu’on lui demandait. Celles qu’elle avait à faire à Balbec étaient si aisées qu’elle montrait presque toujours un mécontentement qui était soudain centuplé et auquel s’alliait une ironique expression d’orgueil quand je me plaignais, au moment d’aller retrouver mes amies, que mon chapeau ne fût pas brossé, ou mes cravates en ordre. Elle qui pouvait se donner tant de peine sans trouver pour cela qu’elle eût rien fait, à la simple observation qu’un veston n’était pas à sa place, non seulement elle vantait avec quel soin elle l’avait « renfermé plutôt que non pas le laisser à la poussière », mais prononçant un éloge en règle de ses travaux, déplorait que ce ne fussent guère des vacances qu’elle prenait à Balbec, qu’on ne trouverait pas une seconde personne comme elle pour mener une telle vie. « Je ne comprends pas comment qu’on peut laisser ses affaires comme ça et allez-y voir si une autre saurait se retrouver dans ce pêle et mêle. Le diable lui-même y perdrait son latin. » Ou bien elle se contentait de prendre un visage de reine, me lançant des regards enflammés, et gardait un silence rompu aussitôt qu’elle avait fermé la porte et s’était engagée dans le couloir ; il retentissait alors de propos que je devinais injurieux, mais qui restaient aussi indistincts que ceux des personnages qui débitent leurs premières paroles derrière le portant avant d’être entrés en scène. D’ailleurs, quand je me préparais ainsi à sortir avec mes amies, même si rien ne manquait et si Françoise était de bonne humeur, elle se montrait tout de même insupportable. Car se servant de plaisanteries que dans mon besoin de parler de ces jeunes filles je lui avais faites sur elles, elle prenait un air de me révéler ce que j’aurais mieux su qu’elle si cela avait été exact, mais ce qui ne l’était pas car Françoise avait mal compris. Elle avait comme tout le monde son caractère propre ; une personne ne ressemble jamais à une voie droite, mais nous étonne de ses détours singuliers et inévitables dont les autres ne s’aperçoivent pas et par où il nous est pénible d’avoir à passer. Chaque fois que j’arrivais au point : « Chapeau pas en place », « nom d’Andrée ou d’Albertine », j’étais obligé par Françoise de m’égarer dans les chemins détournés et absurdes qui me retardaient beaucoup. Il en était de même quand je faisais préparer des sandwiches au chester et à la salade et acheter des tartes que je mangerais à l’heure du goûter, sur la falaise, avec ces jeunes filles, et qu’elles auraient bien pu payer à tour de rôle si elles n’avaient été aussi intéressées, déclarait Françoise, au secours de qui venait alors tout un atavisme de rapacité et de vulgarité provinciales, et pour laquelle on eût dit que l’âme divisée de la défunte Eulalie s’était incarnée, plus gracieusement qu’en Saint-Éloi, dans les corps charmants de mes amies de la petite bande. J’entendais ces accusations avec la rage de me sentir buter à un des endroits à partir desquels le chemin rustique et familier qu’était le caractère de Françoise devenait impraticable, pas pour longtemps heureusement. Puis le veston retrouvé et les sandwichs prêts, j’allais chercher Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, d’autres parfois, et, à pied ou en bicyclette, nous partions.","Except on those rainy days, as we had to go by bicycle on the cliff or in the countryside, an hour in advance I tried to look good and moaned if Françoise had not prepared my things well. Now, even in Paris, she proudly and angrily straightened her figure, which age was beginning to bend, if only she were found to be at fault, she humble, she modest and charming when her self-esteem was flattered. As he was the mainspring of her life, Françoise's satisfaction and good humor were in direct proportion to the difficulty of the things asked of her. Those she had to do at Balbec were so easy that she almost always showed a discontent which was suddenly increased a hundredfold and which was combined with an ironic expression of pride when I complained, when going to see my friends, that my hat was not brushed, or my ties in order. She who could go to so much trouble without realizing that she had done nothing about it, on the mere observation that a jacket was not in its place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had ""enclosed it rather than not leave it to dust"", but pronouncing a regular eulogy of her work, deplored that it was hardly a holiday that she took at Balbec, that one would not find a second person like her to lead such a life. . ""I don't understand how you can leave your stuff like that and go see if someone else can find their way into this jumble. The devil himself would lose his Latin there. Or else she would content herself with putting on a queenly face, casting fiery glances at me, and maintaining a broken silence as soon as she had closed the door and entered the corridor; it resounded then with remarks that I guessed insulting, but which remained as indistinct as those of the characters who deliver their first words behind the rack before entering the stage. Besides, when I was getting ready to go out with my friends like this, even if nothing was missing and if Françoise was in a good mood, she was still unbearable. For, making use of the jokes that I had told her about them in my need to talk about these young girls, she assumed an air of revealing to me what I would have known better than she if it had been exact, but what did not. It wasn't because Françoise had misunderstood. Like everyone else, she had her own character; a person never looks like a straight path, but surprises us with his singular and inevitable detours which others do not notice and through which it is painful for us to have to pass. Each time I got to the point: ""Hat not in place"", ""name of Andrée or Albertine"", I was obliged by Françoise to get lost in the circuitous and absurd paths which delayed me a lot. It was the same when I had chester and salad sandwiches prepared and bought pies which I would eat at tea time, on the cliff, with these young girls, and which they could well have paid for in turn. role if they had not been so interested, declared Françoise, to whose aid then came a whole atavism of provincial rapacity and vulgarity, and for which one would have said that the divided soul of the deceased Eulalie had been incarnated, more gracefully than in Saint-Éloi, in the charming bodies of my friends from the little band. I heard these accusations with the rage of feeling myself bumping into one of the places from which the rustic and familiar path that was the character of Françoise became impracticable, not for long fortunately. Then the jacket found and the sandwiches ready, I went to look for Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, others sometimes, and, on foot or by bicycle, we left.","Except on these rainy days, as we had always arranged to go on our bicycles along the cliffs, or on an excursion inland, an hour or so before it was time to start I would go upstairs to make myself smart and would complain if Françoise had not laid out all the things that I wanted. Now even in Paris she would proudly, angrily straighten a back which the years had begun to bend, at the first word of reproach, she so humble, she so modest and charming when her self–esteem was flattered. As this was the mainspring of her life: her satisfaction, her good humour were in direct ratio to the difficulty of the tasks imposed on her. Those which she had to perform at Balbec were so easy that she shewed almost all the time a discontent which was suddenly multiplied an hundredfold, with the addition of an ironic air of offended dignity when I complained, on my way down to join my friends, that my hat had not been brushed or my ties sorted. She who was capable of taking such endless pains, without in consequence assuming that she had done anything at all, on my simply remarking that a coat was not in its proper place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had ""put it past sooner than let it go gathering the dust,"" but, paying a formal tribute to her own labours, lamented that it was little enough of a holiday that she was getting at Balbec, and that we would not find another person in the whole world who would consent to put up with such treatment. ""I can't think how anyone can leave things lying about the way you do; you just try and get anyone else to find what you want in such a mix–up. The devil himself would give it up as a bad job. "" Or else she would adopt a regal mien, scorching me with her fiery glance, and preserve a silence that was broken as soon as she had fastened the door behind her and was outside in the passage, which would then reverberate with utterances which I guessed to be insulting, though they remained as indistinct as those of characters in a play whose opening lines are spoken in the wings, before they appear on the stage. And even if nothing was missing and Françoise was in a good temper, still she made herself quite intolerable when I was getting ready to go out with my friends. For, drawing upon a store of stale witticisms at their expense which, in my need to be talking about the girls, I had made in her hearing, she put on an air of being about to reveal to me things of which I should have known more than she had there been any truth in her statements, which there never was, Françoise having misunderstood what she had heard. She had, like most people, her own ways; a person is never like a straight highway, but surprises us with the strange, unavoidable windings of his course through life, by which, though some people may not notice them, we find it a perpetual annoyance to be stopped and hindered. Whenever I arrived at the stage of ""Where is my hat?"" or uttered the name of Andrée or Albertine, I was forced by Françoise to stray into endless and absurd side–tracks which greatly delayed my progress. So too when I asked her to cut me the sandwiches of cheese or salad, or sent her out for the cakes which I was to eat while we rested on the cliffs, sharing them with the girls, and which the girls ""might very well have taken turns to provide, if they had not been so close,"" declared Françoise, to whose aid there came at such moments a whole heritage of atavistic peasant rapacity and coarseness, and for whom one would have said that the soul of her late enemy Eulalie had been broken into fragments and reincarnate, more attractively than it had ever been in Saint– Eloi's, in the charming bodies of my friends of the little band. I listened to these accusations with a dull fury at finding myself brought to a standstill at one of those places beyond which the well–trodden country path that was Françoise's character became impassable, though fortunately never for very long. Then, my hat or coat found and the sandwiches ready, I sailed out to find Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, and any others there might be, and on foot or on our bicycles we would start.","Except on these rainy days, we usually went cycling along the cliffs or into the countryside behind Balbec; and an hour before it was time to go I would be fully occupied in titivating myself and nagging at Françoise if she had not laid out my things properly. Even in Paris, at the slightest hint of a criticism, Françoise, who was so humble, capable of such charming modesty when her self-esteem was soothed by praise, would stiffen with offended pride, straightening her back, which was beginning to stoop with age. And as the pride she took in her work was what gave purpose to her whole life, her satisfaction and good humour were in direct proportion to the difficulty of the duties she was required to perform. At Balbec, her only tasks were so easy that she went about them with an air of discontent, which could be instantly intensified and aggravated into a grimace of ironic pride if I should complain, when I was about to set off to meet my girl-friends, that my hat was unbrushed or my ties in disarray. She did not mind putting herself to any amount of trouble; but if one so much as remarked that a jacket was not in the right place, not only did she take pleasure and pique in pointing out the care with which she had ‘put it by, so as to not have the dust gather’, but she would treat you to a diatribe on the subject of her tasks, the sad fact that this whole long time in Balbec was no holiday for her, and that you could never find another body to put up with it! ‘ I can’t understand how a body can be expected to just drop everything, and you mark my words, nobody else would be able to! A mess like this – it’s more than flesh and bone should have to cope with!’ Or else she would look regal, wither me with a glare and say nothing, until, that is, she had left the room, closed the door and was walking along the corridor, which then echoed with words which I could surmise were insulting, but which were as indistinct as those uttered by characters coming on stage and already speaking as they emerge from the wings. Moreover, at these times when I was getting ready to go for an outing with the girls, even if everything was in order and Françoise was in a good mood, she could still show herself at her insufferable worst: she trotted out jokes which, in my need to speak of the girls, I had retailed to her, and seemed to think she was informing me of things which, if they had been true, I would have known more about than she did, but which were not true, because she had misunderstood something I had told her. Like everyone, Françoise had her own character: no one we know ever resembles a straight path; and we will always be astonished by every person’s twists and turns, idiosyncratic, unavoidable and irksome as they may be, which others may not even be aware of, but which we have to put up with. Whenever my speech with Françoise reached the ‘Hat not in the right place’ stage or ‘Mention of the name of Andrée or Albertine’, she obliged me to follow her ludicrous rigmaroles along the highways and byways of her thought processes, all of which greatly delayed my preparations. The same happened when I asked her to make up sandwiches of Cheshire cheese and lettuce, or to buy some tarts, which I intended for a picnic later that afternoon, up on the cliffs, ‘with those girls who (said Françoise) could surely have been expected to buy their own once in a while, if they weren’t just out after what they could get’, all her atavistic avarice and provincial vulgarity coming out in such statements, which could have made one think the soul of Eulalie, dead, departed and divided, had been reincarnated, more gracefully than in St Éloi, in the delightful persons of my little gang of girl-friends. I weathered these aspersions, galled to know that here I had reached one of the points where the familiar and rambling country lane of Françoise’s character had just become impassable (though, fortunately, not for long). Then, the jacket having turned up, the sandwiches having been made, I would sally forth to meet Albertine, Andrée and Rosemonde, and at times others of the group, and together, on foot or on bicycles, we would set off."
"Au Jardin d’Acclimatation, que j’étais fier, quand nous étions descendus de voiture, de m’avancer à côté de Mme Swann ! Tandis que dans sa démarche nonchalante elle laissait flotter son manteau, je jetais sur elle des regards d’admiration auxquels elle répondait coquettement par un long sourire. Maintenant si nous rencontrions l’un ou l’autre des camarades, fille ou garçon, de Gilberte, qui nous saluait de loin, j’étais à mon tour regardé par eux comme un de ces êtres que j’avais enviés, un de ces amis de Gilberte qui connaissaient sa famille et étaient mêlés à l’autre partie de sa vie, celle qui ne se passait pas aux Champs-Élysées.","At the Jardin d'Acclimatation, how proud I was, when we got out of the car, to walk up next to Madame Swann! While in her nonchalant gait she let her coat float, I threw on her glances of admiration to which she coquettishly replied with a long smile. Now if we met one or the other of Gilberte's comrades, girl or boy, who greeted us from afar, I in turn was looked upon by them as one of those beings whom I had envied, one of those Gilberte's friends who knew her family and were involved in the other part of her life, that which did not take place on the Champs-Élysées.","In the Jardin d'Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte's friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs–Elysées.","Once we had left the carriage, how proud I was to walk through the Zoological Gardens beside Mme Swann! Her easy step gave a loose, lazy sway to her coat, and she rewarded my admiring glances with a slow, flirtatious smile. If we met any of Gilberte’s friends, girls or boys, they would greet us as we passed; and now I was looked upon by them as one of those blessed beings whom I had envied so much, those friends who also knew her parents and who belonged to the other part of her life, the part which took place away from the Champs-Élysées."
"– J’sais pas, moi ; alors c’est beaucoup d’être le directeur du cabinet ? répondait Gilberte qui ne perdait jamais une occasion de manifester de l’indifférence pour tout ce qui donnait de la vanité à ses parents (elle pouvait d’ailleurs penser qu’elle ne faisait qu’ajouter à une relation aussi éclatante, en n’ayant pas l’air d’y attacher trop d’importance).","– I don’t know, me; so it's a lot to be the director of the firm? replied Gilberte, who never lost an opportunity to show indifference to everything that gave her parents vanity (she could also think that she was only adding to such a brilliant relationship, by don't seem to attach too much importance to it).","Upon my word, I'm getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he's the Permanent Secretary."" ""I don't know, I'm sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?"" answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. (She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.)",", what am I saying? I’m as silly as you are – he’s not just the private secretary , he’s the principal private secretary! – Well, I dunno, do I? So a principal private secretary, that’s good, is it?’ Gilberte said, always ready to show indifference to whatever her parents took pride in, or possibly thinking to enhance the effect of their acquaintance with such an exalted personage by appearing not to attach much importance to it."
"Cette fois-là nous rencontrâmes presque tout de suite la grande Andrée, celle qui avait sauté par-dessus le premier président ; Albertine dut me présenter. Son amie avait des yeux extraordinairement clairs, comme est dans un appartement à l’ombre l’entrée, par la porte ouverte, d’une chambre où donnent le soleil et le reflet verdâtre de la mer illuminée.","This time we met almost immediately the tall Andrée, the one who had jumped over the first president; Albertine had to introduce me. Her friend had eyes that were extraordinarily clear, like the entrance, through the open door, to a room in a shady apartment where the sun and the greenish reflection of the illuminated sea look out.","On this occasion we met almost immediately the tall one, Andrée, the one who had jumped over the old banker, and Albertine was obliged to introduce me. Her friend had a pair of eyes of extraordinary brightness, like, in a dark house, a glimpse through an open door of a room into which the sun is shining with a greenish reflexion from the glittering sea.","On this occasion, almost without delay we met the tall girl, Andrée, the one who had jumped over the First President;96 and Albertine had to introduce me. Her friend’s face was lighted by eyes that were extraordinarily limpid, as a dimly lit flat is brightened through an open bedroom door by the sunshine and greenish glow reflected up from the sea."
