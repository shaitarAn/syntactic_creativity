A great breath of love, of restrained desire, had come from the nudity of the platform, ran through the living room, where the women were more languid in their seats, while the men, in their ears, spoke to each other in low tones. smiles. It was an alcove whisper, a semi-silence of good company, a wish for pleasure scarcely expressed by a quivering of the lips; and in the mute looks, meeting in the midst of this fashionable rapture, there was the brutal boldness of loves offered and accepted at a glance.","The audience applauded discreetly, and conversation resumed. An amorous breeze, a current of suppressed desire, had proceeded from the simulated nudity on the stage into the drawing room, where the women lay back a bit deeper in their chairs and the men exchanged smiles and whispered in one another’s ears. It was the sound of pillow talk, the tasteful hush of refined people whose lips quivered with scarcely formulated desires, and in the mute looks exchanged amidst all this decorous delectation one sensed the shameless frankness of love offered and accepted at a glance.","The audience applauded discreetly, and the conversations were resumed.

"Elle resta un moment les yeux grands ouverts, pleins de cette apparition, qui lui rappelait une autre heure de sa vie.

"Et il lui conta ce qu’il avait entendu chez Laure, lâchement, sournoisement, goûtant une secrète joie à descendre dans ces infamies. Il lui semblait qu’il se vengeait d’une injure vague qu’on venait de lui faire. Son tempérament de fille s’attardait béatement à cette dénonciation, à ce bavardage cruel, surpris derrière une porte.

He spared Renée nothing, neither the money which her husband had loaned her for usury, nor the money which he intended to steal from her, with the aid of ridiculous stories, good for putting children to sleep. The young woman listened to him, very pale, her lips tight. Standing in front of the fireplace, she lowered her head a little, she looked at the fire.

He spared Renée nothing: neither the money her husband had lent her at usurious rates nor the sum he intended to steal from her with the help of ridiculous fairy tales fit only for putting children to sleep. Renée listened, looking quite livid, her lips pinched. Standing in front of the fireplace, she bowed her head slightly and gazed at the fire.

"Ils avaient glissé à l’inceste, dès le jour où Maxime, dans sa tunique râpée de collégien, s’était pendu au cou de Renée, en chiffonnant son habit de garde française.

Her lace looked crudely white against the dark background of tapestry and old-fashioned furniture. Monsieur Béraud du Châtel gazed at her with his hands resting on the edge of his reading desk. Aunt Élisabeth mentioned the imminent wedding of Christine, who was about to marry the son of a very well-to-do solicitor; she had gone shopping with an old family servant; and the aunt talked on all by herself, in her placid voice, her needles in perpetual motion, chatting away about her domestic affairs and casting smiling glances at Renée over her spectacles."
"Il jurait, il aurait battu les gens. Puis, sans attendre de réponse, sans rien regarder, il tourna le dos, replongea sous les draperies, disparut.

"Dans le petit salon, elle se rencontra face à face avec Mme Sidonie. Celle-ci, pour jouir du drame, s’était postée de nouveau sur le perron de la serre. Mais elle ne sut plus que penser, quand Saccard reparut avec Maxime, et qu’il répondit brutalement à ses questions faites à voix basse, qu’elle rêvait, qu’il n’y avait « rien du tout ». Puis elle flaira la vérité. Sa face jaune blêmit, elle trouvait la chose vraiment forte. Et, doucement, elle vint coller son oreille à la porte de l’escalier, espérant qu’elle entendrait Renée pleurer, en haut. Lorsque la jeune femme ouvrit la porte, le battant souffleta presque sa belle-sœur.","In the small drawing-room, she met face to face with Madame Sidonie. The latter, to enjoy the drama, had posted herself again on the steps of the greenhouse. But she no longer knew what to think, when Saccard reappeared with Maxime, and he brutally answered her questions in a low voice, that she was dreaming, that there was ""nothing at all"". Then she smelled the truth. Her yellow face paled, she found the thing really strong. And, softly, she put her ear to the door of the stairs, hoping that she would hear Renée crying upstairs. When the young woman opened the door, the leaf almost slapped her sister-in-law.","In the small salon she found herself face-to-face with Mme Sidonie, who had again stationed herself on the conservatory steps to relish the drama. But she no longer knew what to think when Saccard reappeared with Maxime and to her whispered questions brusquely replied that she was dreaming, that there was “nothing at all.” Then the truth dawned on her. Her yellow face turned white: this really was too much. Quietly, she went over and glued her ear to the door of the staircase, hoping that she would hear Renée sobbing upstairs. When the young woman opened the door, it nearly struck her sister-in-law in the face.","In the little drawing room she came face to face with Madame Sidonie.

"Mais son mari s’était levé, et s’accoudant sur la rampe de la fenêtre : — C’est la colonne Vendôme, n’est-ce pas, qui brille là-bas ?… Ici, plus à droite, voilà la Madeleine… Un beau quartier, où il y a beaucoup à faire… Ah !","But her husband had risen, and leaning his elbows on the railing of the window: ""It's the Vendôme column, isn't it, which shines over there?...

"Renée, penchée en avant, la main appuyée sur la portière basse de la calèche, regardait, éveillée du rêve triste qui, depuis une heure, la tenait silencieuse, allongée au fond de la voiture, comme dans une chaise longue de convalescente. Elle portait, sur une robe de soie mauve, à tablier et à tunique, garnie de larges volants plissés, un petit paletot de drap blanc, aux revers de velours mauve, qui lui donnait un grand air de crânerie. Ses étranges cheveux fauve pâle, dont la couleur rappelait celle du beurre fin, étaient à peine cachés par un mince chapeau orné d’une touffe de roses du Bengale. Elle continuait à cligner des yeux, avec sa mine de garçon impertinent, son front pur traversé d’une grande ride, sa bouche, dont la lèvre supérieure avançait, ainsi que celle des enfants boudeurs. Puis, comme elle voyait mal, elle prit son binocle, un binocle d’homme, à garniture d’écaille, et, le tenant à la main, sans se le poser sur le nez, elle examina la grosse Laure d’Aurigny[2] tout à son aise, d’un air parfaitement calme.","Renée, leaning forward, her hand resting on the low door of the carriage, watched, awakened from the sad dream which, for an hour, had kept her silent, stretched out in the back of the carriage, as if in a convalescent's chaise longue. She wore, over a mauve silk dress, with apron and tunic, trimmed with large pleated frills, a little overcoat of white cloth, with mauve velvet facings, which gave her a grand air of swagger. Her strange pale tawny hair, the color of which was reminiscent of fine butter, was barely hidden by a thin hat adorned with a tuft of Bengal roses. She continued to blink, with her impertinent boyish expression, her pure forehead crossed by a great wrinkle, her mouth, whose upper lip protruded, like that of sulky children. Then, as she could hardly see, she took her binoculars, a man's binoculars, trimmed with tortoiseshell, and, holding it in her hand, without putting it on her nose, she examined the fat Laure d'Aurigny. ] completely at ease, looking perfectly calm.","Renée, leaning forward with her hand resting on the low door of the calèche, stared, awakened at last from the melancholy dream that had kept her silent for the past hour as she lay stretched out in the back of the carriage like a convalescent resting on a chaise longue. Over a mauve silk dress fitted with pinafore and tunic and trimmed with wide pleated flounces, she wore a white cloth jacket with mauve velvet facings, which lent quite a swagger to her look. Her strange hair, of a pale tawny color reminiscent of the finest butter, was barely hidden by a thin hat embellished by a cluster of Bengal roses. Continuing to squint, she had the air of an impertinent youth, with a large furrow in her otherwise unblemished brow and an upper lip that protruded like a sulky child’s. Because it was hard for her to see, she took her eyeglasses—a man’s pince-nez with horn rims—and, holding them in her hand without setting them on her nose, examined the well-endowed Laure at her leisure and with an air of perfect calm.","Awakened from the melancholy dream that had kept her silent for an hour, stretched out on the back seat of the carriage as on an invalid’s chaise longue, Renée leaned forward to look, resting her hand on the low door of the barouche. Over a gown consisting of a mauve silk polonaise* and tunic, trimmed with wide, plaited flounces, she wore a little coat of white cloth with mauve velvet lapels, which made her look very smart. Her strange, fawn-coloured hair, like the colour of fine butter, was barely concealed by a tiny bonnet adorned with a little bunch of Bengal roses. She continued to screw up her eyes in a way that made her look like a cheeky little boy, her smooth forehead furrowed by a long crease, her upper lip protruding like a sulky child’s. Then, finding that she could not see, she took her eyeglass, a man’s double eyeglass with a tortoiseshell frame, and, holding it in her hand without placing it on her nose, examined at leisure the fat Laure d’Aurigny, with an air of complete detachment."
"— Je vais t’enfermer ici, dit-elle enfin ; et quand il fera jour, nous partirons pour Le Havre.","""I'm going to lock you up here,"" she said at last; and when it is light, we will leave for Le Havre.","“I’m going to lock you up here,” she said at last, “and when day comes we’ll leave for Le Havre.”","‘I’ll lock you in here,’ she said at last, ‘and as soon as it’s daylight we’ll leave for Le Havre.’"
"Les rouages de l’expropriation, de cette machine puissante qui, pendant quinze ans, a bouleversé Paris, soufflant la fortune et la ruine, sont des plus simples. Dès qu’une voie nouvelle est décrétée, les agents voyers dressent le plan parcellaire et évaluent les propriétés. D’ordinaire, pour les immeubles, après enquête, ils capitalisent la location totale et peuvent ainsi donner un chiffre approximatif. La commission des indemnités, composée de membres du conseil municipal, fait toujours une offre inférieure à ce chiffre, sachant que les intéressés réclameront davantage, et qu’il y aura concession mutuelle. Quand ils ne peuvent s’entendre, l’affaire est portée devant un jury qui se prononce souverainement sur l’offre de la Ville et la demande du propriétaire ou du locataire exproprié.","The cogs of expropriation, of this powerful machine which, for fifteen years, upset Paris, blowing fortune and ruin, are very simple. As soon as a new road is decreed, the voyers agents draw up the plot plan and evaluate the properties. Usually, for buildings, after investigation, they capitalize the total rental and can thus give an approximate figure. The indemnity commission, made up of members of the municipal council, always makes an offer lower than this figure, knowing that the interested parties will claim more, and that there will be mutual concession. When they cannot agree, the case is brought before a jury which decides on the City's offer and the request of the owner or the expropriated tenant.","Confiscation by eminent domain—the powerful machine that bulldozed its way through Paris for fifteen years, leaving wealth and ruin in its wake—could not be simpler in its operation. As soon as the decision to build a new street is made, surveyors map out the affected parcels of land and estimate the value of the properties. In the case of rental properties, they make inquiries to determine the income stream from rentals in order to calculate an approximate value of the building as a capital investment. The indemnity commission, made up of members of the municipal council, then makes an offer that is always less than this calculated figure, knowing that the owners will ask for more and that the eventual price will be reached through compromise. If agreement cannot be reached, the case goes to a jury, which has the final say in arbitrating between the city’s offer and the price asked by the landlord or lessee facing expropriation.","The mechanisms of expropriation, of the powerful system that for fifteen years turned Paris upside-down, creating fortunes and bringing ruin, are of the simplest. As soon as a new boulevard is decided upon, the surveyors draw up the plan in separate sections and establish a valuation of the buildings. As a rule, in the case of houses let as apartments, they add up the total amount of the rents after making enquiries, and are thus able to determine the approximate value. The Compensation Authority, consisting of members of the City Council, always makes an offer lower than this sum, knowing that the interested parties will claim more and that there will be a concession on both sides. When they are unable to come to terms the case is taken before a jury, which pronounces on the City’s offer and the claim of the evicted landlord or tenant. *"
"Aristide fut très aigre. Il accusa Eugène de l’avoir laissé végéter, de ne pas même lui avoir fait l’aumône d’un bon conseil, pendant qu’il pataugeait en province.

"Le lendemain, au bal du ministère, la belle Mme Saccard fut merveilleuse. Worms avait accepté l’acompte de cinquante mille francs ; elle sortait de cet embarras d’argent, avec des rires de convalescente. Quand elle traversa les salons, dans sa grande robe de faille rose à longue traîne Louis XIV, encadrée de hautes dentelles blanches, il y eut un murmure, les hommes se bousculèrent pour la voir. Et les intimes s’inclinaient, avec un discret sourire d’intelligence, rendant hommage à ces belles épaules, si connues du tout-Paris officiel, et qui étaient les fermes colonnes de l’empire. Elle s’était décolletée avec un tel mépris des regards, elle marchait si calme et si tendre dans sa nudité, que cela n’était presque plus indécent. Eugène Rougon, le grand homme politique qui sentait cette gorge nue plus éloquente encore que sa parole à la Chambre, plus douce et plus persuasive pour faire goûter les charmes du règne et convaincre les sceptiques, alla complimenter sa belle-sœur sur son heureux coup d’audace d’avoir échancré son corsage de deux doigts de plus. Presque tout le Corps législatif était là, et à la façon dont les députés regardaient la jeune femme, le ministre se promettait un beau succès, le lendemain, dans la question délicate des emprunts de la Ville de Paris. On ne pouvait voter contre un pouvoir qui faisait pousser, dans le terreau des millions, une fleur comme cette Renée, une si étrange fleur de volupté, à la chair de soie, aux nudités de statue, vivante jouissance qui laissait derrière elle une odeur de plaisir tiède. Mais ce qui fit chuchoter le bal entier, ce fut la rivière et l’aigrette. Les hommes reconnaissaient les bijoux. Les femmes se les désignaient du regard, furtivement. On ne parla que de ça toute la soirée. Et les salons allongeaient leur enfilade, dans la lumière blanche des lustres, emplis d’une cohue resplendissante, comme un fouillis d’astres tombés dans un coin trop étroit.","The next day, at the ministry ball, the beautiful Madame Saccard was wonderful. Worms had accepted the deposit of fifty thousand francs; she emerged from this embarrassment of money with the laughter of a convalescent. When she crossed the salons, in her large Louis XIV long-tailed pink loincloth dress, framed with high white lace, there was a murmur, the men jostled to see her. And those close to them bowed, with a discreet smile of intelligence, paying homage to those fine shoulders, so well known to all official Paris, and which were the firm columns of the empire. She had undressed with such contempt for looks, she walked so calm and tender in her nudity, that it was almost no longer indecent. Eugène Rougon, the great politician who felt that bare throat was even more eloquent than his words in the Chamber, sweeter and more persuasive in making people taste the charms of the reign and convince skeptics, went to compliment his sister-in-law on her happy stroke of luck. audacity to have her bodice cut two fingers longer. Almost all the Legislative Body was there, and from the way the deputies looked at the young woman, the minister promised himself great success the next day in the delicate question of loans from the City of Paris. One could not vote against a power which caused a flower like this Renee to grow in the soil of millions, such a strange flower of voluptuousness, with flesh of silk, with the nudity of a statue, a living enjoyment which left behind it an odor of lukewarm pleasure. But what made the whole ball whisper was the river and the egret. The men recognized the jewelry. The women pointed to them furtively. We just talked about that all night. And the salons lengthened their row, in the white light of the chandeliers, filled with a resplendent crowd, like a jumble of stars fallen into too narrow a corner.","The next day, at the ministry ball, beautiful Mme Saccard was marvelous to behold. Worms had accepted the payment of 50,000 francs. She emerged from financial embarrassment laughing like a woman who has recovered from a serious illness. When she crossed the salons in her splendid pink faille gown with its long Louis XIV train edged with white lace, there was a murmur, and the men shouldered one another aside to catch a glimpse of her. Those who knew her intimately bowed with discreet, knowing smiles, paying homage to those beautiful shoulders, so well-known to all of official Paris—indeed, they were the stalwart pillars on which the Empire rested. She had bared her bosom with such scorn for gawkers, and walked with such tranquillity and tenderness in her nudity, that it almost ceased to be indecent. Eugène Rougon, the illustrious politician, recognizing that those bare breasts were even more eloquent than his speeches in the Chamber and better at convincing skeptics and making people savor the charms of the reign, went over and complimented his sister-in-law on her bold stroke in dropping her neckline yet another inch— a happy inspiration, he called it. Nearly all the members of the Corps Législatif were there, and from the way the deputies were looking at the young woman, the minister expected to win a handsome victory when the delicate matter of the City of Paris loans came before that body one day hence. No one could vote against a government that could take a compost of millions of francs and out of such a dung heap produce a flower like Renée—such a strangely voluptuous flower, with her silky flesh, her statuesque nudity, her sensuous presence that left a warm fragrance of pleasure in its wake. What had everyone at the ball whispering, however, were the necklace and the aigrette. The men recognized these gems. The women pointed them out to one another with furtive glances. No one talked about anything else the whole evening. And the salons, illuminated by white light from chandeliers, stretched off into the distance, filled with a resplendent throng, like a constellation of stars fallen into a space too small to hold them.","The next day, at the Ministry ball, the beautiful Madame Saccard was dazzling.

"Aristide avait du respect pour Eugène, qui lui semblait un gaillard hors ligne. Il ne lui pardonna pas ses défiances, ni sa franchise un peu rude ; mais il alla docilement s’enfermer rue Saint-Jacques. Il était venu avec cinq cents francs que lui avait prêtés le père de sa femme. Les frais du voyage payés, il fit durer un mois les trois cents francs qui lui restaient. Angèle était une grosse mangeuse ; elle crut, en outre, devoir rafraîchir sa toilette de gala par une garniture de rubans mauves. Ce mois d’attente parut interminable à Aristide. L’impatience le brûlait. Lorsqu’il se mettait à la fenêtre, et qu’il sentait sous lui le labeur géant de Paris, il lui prenait des envies folles de se jeter d’un bond dans la fournaise, pour y pétrir l’or de ses mains fiévreuses, comme une cire molle. Il aspirait ces souffles encore vagues qui montaient de la grande cité, ces souffles de l’empire naissant, où traînaient déjà des odeurs d’alcôves et de tripots financiers, des chaleurs de jouissances. Les fumets légers qui lui arrivaient lui disaient qu’il était sur la bonne piste, que le gibier courait devant lui, que la grande chasse impériale, la chasse aux aventures, aux femmes, aux millions, commençait enfin.","Aristide had respect for Eugene, who seemed to him a fellow out of line. He did not forgive her for her distrust, nor her somewhat rough frankness; but he obediently went and shut himself up in the rue Saint-Jacques. He had come with five hundred francs which his wife's father had lent him. The travel expenses paid, he made the three hundred francs he had left last for a month. Angèle was a big eater; she thought, moreover, that she ought to freshen up her gala dress with a trimming of mauve ribbons. This month of waiting seemed interminable to Aristide. Impatience burned him. When he stood at the window, and felt beneath him the gigantic labor of Paris, he took mad desires to throw himself at a bound into the furnace, to knead the gold there with his feverish hands, like a soft wax. He inhaled those still vague breaths that rose from the great city, those breaths of the nascent empire, where the smells of alcoves and financial gambling dens, the warmth of enjoyment, already trailed. The light scents that reached him told him that he was on the right track, that the game was running ahead of him, that the great imperial hunt, the hunt for adventures, women, millions, was finally beginning.","Aristide respected Eugène, who struck him as a man of unparalleled vigor. Yet he found his suspicious nature and rather brusque candor unforgivable. Nevertheless, he docilely returned home and shut himself up in the apartment on the rue Saint-Jacques. He had arrived in Paris with 500 francs borrowed from his father-in-law. After paying all his traveling expenses, he was left with 300 francs, which he managed to stretch for a month. Angèle was a big eater. And she just had to spruce up her party dress with mauve ribbons. To Aristide the month of waiting seemed interminable. He burned with impatience. When he stood at the window and sensed the gigantic labor of Paris below, he was seized by a mad impulse to leap into the forge, to knead the gold with his own feverish hands, like soft wax. He breathed in the still-indistinct air of the great city, the air of nascent empire, already redolent of the fragrances of the alcove, of financial chicanery, and of steamy pleasures. The faint aromas that wafted his way told him that he was on the right track, that his quarry was on the run ahead of him, that the great imperial hunt—for adventure, for women, for millions—was at last getting under way.","Aristide had a certain respect for Eugène, whom he regarded as someone quite exceptional. He could not forgive his lack of trust, or his bluntness, which was a trifle excessive; but he went home obediently and shut himself away in the Rue Saint-Jacques. He had arrived with five hundred francs, which had been lent by his wife’s father. After paying for the journey, he made the three hundred francs that remained last him a month. Angèle was a great eater; moreover she thought it necessary to trim her Sunday dress with a fresh set of mauve ribbons. That month of waiting seemed endless to Aristide. He was consumed with impatience. When he sat at the window and watched the teeming life of Paris beneath him, he was seized by an insane desire to hurl himself into the furnace in order to mould the gold like soft wax with his fevered hands. He inhaled the breath, vague as yet, that rose from the great city, the breath of the budding Empire, laden already with the odours of alcoves and financial deals, with the warm smell of sensuality. The faint traces that reached him told him that he was on the right scent, that the prey was scudding before him, that the great Imperial hunt, the hunt for adventure, women, and fortunes, was about to begin."
"À cette heure, Paris offrait, pour un homme comme Aristide Saccard, le plus intéressant des spectacles.

Le silence s’était fait à la tribune et dans les journaux. La société, sauvée encore une fois, se félicitait, se reposait, faisait la grasse matinée, maintenant qu’un gouvernement fort la protégeait et lui ôtait jusqu’au souci de penser et de régler ses affaires. La grande préoccupation de la société était de savoir à quels amusements elle allait tuer le temps.

Partout, aux Tuileries, chez les ministres, chez les simples millionnaires, en bas et en haut, tu règnes en souveraine. Il n’y a pas de plaisir où tu n’aies mis les deux pieds, et si j’osais, si le respect que je te dois ne me retenait pas, je dirais…","""Go, don't be modest,"" continued Maxime; admit frankly that you are one of the columns of the second Empire. Between us, we can say these things to each other. Everywhere, at the Tuileries, among ministers, among mere millionaires, above and below, you reign supreme. There is no pleasure where you have not put both feet, and if I dared, if the respect I owe you did not hold me back, I would say...","“Don’t be modest,” Maxime went on. “Come right out and admit that you’re one of the pillars of the Second Empire. You and I can say such things to each other. You’re the queen wherever you go: in the Tuileries,7 in the homes of ministers, or merely among millionaires, everywhere, from top to bottom, you’re in command. There is no pleasure you haven’t jumped into with both feet, and if I dared, if the respect I owe you did not hold me back, I would say—”","‘Don’t be so modest,’ Maxime continued. ‘ Admit that you’re one of the pillars of the Second Empire. We needn’t hide these things from each other. Wherever you go, to the Tuileries,* to the houses of ministers, to the houses of mere millionaires, high or low, you’re treated like a queen. There isn’t a pleasure you haven’t tasted, and if I had the courage, if my respect for you did not hold me back, I’d say…’"
"— Oui, répondit tranquillement la marchande de dentelles, c’est une de mes clientes qui le trouve beaucoup mieux en face de la cheminée. Elle m’a conseillé aussi des rideaux rouges.","""Yes,"" replied the lace seller calmly, ""one of my clients finds it much better in front of the fireplace."" She also recommended red curtains.","she said after a while. “You moved the bed, didn’t you?” “Yes,” came the milliner’s calm answer. “One of my customers thought it was much better facing the fireplace. She also advised me to get red curtains.”","‘Yes,’ the lace-dealer replied quietly, ‘one of my customers prefers it facing the mantelpiece. She was the one who advised me to get red curtains.’"
"Saccard lui jeta un regard si aigu, qu’Eugène se dit en refermant la porte : « Voilà une plaisanterie qui me coûterait cher, si je n’étais pas un Rougon. »","Saccard gave him such a sharp look that Eugene said to himself as he closed the door: ""That's a joke that would cost me dear if I weren't a Rougon."" »","Saccard shot him a look so cutting that Eugène, as he closed the door behind him, mused to himself that “that little pleasantry would no doubt cost me dearly if I weren’t a Rougon.”","Saccard gave him such a ferocious look that Eugène said to himself, as he closed the door: ‘That’s a joke that would cost me dear if I were not a Rougon.’"
"Un gros homme affirmait que l’empereur était le monsieur qui tournait le dos au cocher, à gauche. Quelques mains se levèrent pour saluer. Mais Saccard, qui avait retiré son chapeau, avant même que les piqueurs eussent passé, attendit que la voiture impériale se trouvât juste en face de lui, et alors il cria de sa grosse voix provençale :","A fat man claimed that the Emperor was the gentleman with his back to the coachman on the left. A few hands went up in greeting. But Saccard, who had taken off his hat even before the piqueurs had passed, waited until the imperial carriage was right in front of him, and then he cried out in his thick Provençal voice:","One fat man maintained that the Emperor was the gentleman with his back to the coachman on the left. A few hands were raised in salute.

"Mais ce mot le fit rire lui-même, et peu à peu il s’anima. Elle lui conta la peur qu’elle venait d’avoir dans le parc Monceau. Alors elle lui confessa une de ses autres envies : elle aurait voulu faire, la nuit, sur le petit lac du parc, une promenade dans la barque qu’elle voyait de ses fenêtres, échouée au bord d’une allée. Il trouva qu’elle devenait élégiaque. Le fiacre roulait toujours, les ténèbres restaient profondes, ils se penchaient l’un vers l’autre pour s’entendre dans le bruit des roues, se frôlant du geste, sentant leur haleine tiède, parfois, lorsqu’ils s’approchaient trop. Et, à temps égaux, le cigare de Maxime se ravivait, tachait l’ombre de rouge, en jetant un éclair pâle et rose sur le visage de Renée. Elle était adorable, vue à cette lueur rapide ; si bien que le jeune homme en fut frappé.","But this word made him laugh himself, and little by little he grew animated. She told him about the fear she had just had in the Parc Monceau. Then she confessed to him one of her other desires: she would have liked to go for a night trip on the little lake in the park, in the boat which she saw from her windows, stranded at the edge of an alley. He thought she was becoming elegiac. The cab was still rolling, the darkness remained deep, they leaned towards each other to hear each other in the noise of the wheels, brushing each other with their gestures, feeling their warm breath, sometimes, when they got too close. And, at equal times, Maxime's cigar revived, stained the shade red, throwing a pale and rosy flash on Renée's face. She was adorable, seen in that quick gleam; so that the young man was struck by it.","But this sally made him laugh, and little by little he grew more animated. She told him about the fear she had felt just now in crossing the Parc Monceau. Then she confessed another of her desires: some night she hoped to go rowing on the little lake in the park in the boat she could see from her window, which had been left lying next to one of the paths. He thought she was getting rather sentimental. The cab rolled on, the gloom remained thick, and the two passengers leaned toward each other in order to hear better over the sound of the wheels, so that occasionally, when they got too close, their hands touched and they could feel each other’s warm breath. At regular intervals, Maxime’s cigar would flare up again, tinting the shadows red and casting a pale pink light on Renée’s face. She looked lovely in that fleeting glimmer, so lovely that the young man was struck by it. “Oh, my, we’re looking very pretty tonight, step-mama!","But this remark made him laugh, and little by little he became more animated. She told him how frightened she had felt in the Parc Monceau. Then she confessed another of her longings: she would like one night to go for a row on the little lake in the gardens in the little boat she could see from her windows, moored at the edge of a pathway. He thought she was becoming sentimental. The cab rolled on, the darkness remained impenetrable, they leant forward to hear each other amid the noise of the wheels, touching one another when they moved and even inhaling one another’s warm breath when they approached too closely. At regular intervals Maxime’s cigar glowed afresh, creating a red blur in the darkness and casting a pale pink flash over Renée’s face. She looked adorable in this fleeting light; so much so that the young man was struck by it."
"Une de leurs grandes parties fut de patiner ; cet hiver-là, le patin était à la mode, l’empereur étant allé un des premiers essayer la glace du lac, au bois de Boulogne. Renée commanda à Worms un costume complet de Polonaise, velours et fourrure ; elle voulut que Maxime eût des bottes molles et un bonnet de renard. Ils arrivaient au Bois, par des froids de loup qui leur piquaient le nez et les lèvres, comme si le vent leur eût soufflé du sable fin au visage. Cela les amusait d’avoir froid. Le Bois était tout gris, avec des filets de neige, semblables, le long des branches, à de minces guipures. Et, sous le ciel pâle, au-dessus du lac figé et terni, il n’y avait que les sapins des îles qui missent encore, au bord de l’horizon, leurs draperies théâtrales, où la neige cousait aussi de hautes dentelles. Ils filaient tous deux dans l’air glacé, du vol rapide des hirondelles qui rasent le sol. Ils mettaient un poing derrière le dos, et se posant mutuellement l’autre main sur l’épaule, ils allaient droits, souriants, côte à côte, tournant sur eux-mêmes, dans le large espace que marquaient de grosses cordes. Du haut de la grande allée, des badauds les regardaient. Parfois ils venaient se chauffer aux brasiers allumés sur le bord du lac. Et ils repartaient. Ils arrondissaient largement leur vol, les yeux pleurant de plaisir et de froid.","One of their great parts was skating; that winter, skating was fashionable, the Emperor having been one of the first to try the ice on the lake, in the Bois de Boulogne. Renée ordered from Worms a complete costume of Polonaise, velvet and fur; she wanted Maxime to have soft boots and a fox's cap. They arrived at the Bois in bitter cold which stung their noses and lips, as if the wind had blown fine sand in their faces. It amused them to be cold. The Wood was all gray, with streaks of snow, similar, along the branches, to thin guipures. And, under the pale sky, above the congealed and tarnished lake, there were only the pines of the islands which still cast, at the edge of the horizon, their theatrical draperies, where the snow also sewed high lace. They both flew through the icy air, like the rapid flight of swallows skimming the ground. They put one fist behind their backs, and placing the other hand mutually on each other's shoulder, they went straight, smiling, side by side, turning on their own, in the wide space marked out by thick cords. From the top of the main alley, onlookers watched them. Sometimes they came to warm themselves at the braziers lit on the edge of the lake. And they were leaving. They rounded their flight widely, their eyes watering with pleasure and coldness.","One of their great entertainments was skating. Skating was “in” that winter, the emperor having been one of the first to try the ice on the lake in the Bois de Boulogne. Renée ordered a complete Polish skating outfit of velvet and fur from Worms and insisted that Maxime wear soft boots and a cap of fox fur. They went to the Bois in weather so bitingly cold that it stung their noses and lips, as if the wind were blowing fine sand against their faces. They enjoyed the cold. The Bois was completely gray, with stripes of snow clinging to the branches like thin strips of lace. And above the dull frozen lake the colorless skies were empty but for the islands whose fir trees still fringed the horizon, except that now those theatrical curtains were trimmed with billows of lace stitched by the snow. Together the two lovers glided through the frigid air like swallows swooping just above the ground. With one hand behind the back and the other on the partner’s shoulder they skated straight ahead, smiling, side by side, then turned and skated back to where they had begun, all within an ample section of the lake marked out by heavy ropes. Spectators watched from the main path above. Occasionally the skaters paused to warm themselves at stoves set up along the shore before resuming their activity, extending their flight as far as possible while tears of pleasure and cold welled up in their eyes.","One of their great delights was skating; that winter skating was fashionable, the Emperor having been one of the first to try the ice on the lake in the Bois de Boulogne. Renée ordered a complete Polish suit from Worms, in velvet and fur; she made Maxime wear doeskin boots and a foxskin hat. They arrived at the Bois in intense cold, which stung their lips and noses as if the wind had blown fine sand into their faces. They thought it was fun to feel cold. The Bois was quite grey, snow threading the branches with narrow strips of lace. Under the pale sky, above the frozen lake, only the fir trees on the islands still displayed, on the horizon, their theatrical drapery, on which the snow had stitched broad bands of lace. They darted along through the icy air, like swallows skimming the ground. With one hand behind their backs and one on each other’s shoulder, they sped along erect and smiling, turning in circles, in the wide space marked out by thick ropes. The sightseers stared at them from the roadway. From time to time they went and warmed themselves at the burning braziers by the side of the lake. Then they shot off again, describing wider circles, their eyes watering with pleasure and cold."

Toutin-Laroche added in an undertone when he had turned back to face the others.","‘He’s falling apart, getting worse every day,’ added Monsieur Toutin-Laroche under his breath, turning towards the other gentlemen."
"Et elle mit son binocle, regarda cette pièce qui avait un luxe de grand hôtel garni. Elle vit sur la cheminée de longues épingles à cheveux qui ne venaient certainement pas du maigre chignon de Mme Sidonie. À l’ancienne place où se trouvait le lit, le papier peint se montrait tout éraflé, déteint et sali par les matelas. La courtière avait bien essayé de cacher cette plaie, derrière les dossiers de deux fauteuils ; mais ces dossiers étaient un peu bas, et Renée s’arrêta à cette bande usée.","And she put on her binoculars, looked at this room which had the luxury of a large furnished hotel. She saw long hairpins on the mantelpiece which certainly did not come from Madame Sidonie's meager bun.

The businesswoman had tried to hide this eyesore behind two armchairs, but the backs of the chairs were rather low, and Renée’s eyes lingered on the worn strip of wallpaper.","She held up her eyeglass and looked round the room, which had the luxurious appearance of a big furnished hotel.

"Céleste ne répondait pas, avait un singulier sourire. Un matin, elle lui apprit tranquillement qu’elle s’en allait, qu’elle retournait au pays.

"Renée ne put en tirer une parole plus claire. Ses soucis, d’ailleurs, grandissaient. Sa vie tapageuse, ses courses folles, rencontraient des obstacles nombreux qu’il lui fallait franchir, et contre lesquels elle se meurtrissait parfois. Ce fut ainsi que Louise de Mareuil se dressa un jour entre elle et Maxime. Elle n’était pas jalouse de « la bossue », comme elle la nommait dédaigneusement ; elle la savait condamnée par les médecins, et ne pouvait croire que Maxime épousât jamais un pareil laideron, même au prix d’un million de dot. Dans ses chutes, elle avait conservé une naïveté bourgeoise à l’égard des gens qu’elle aimait ; si elle se méprisait elle-même, elle les croyait volontiers supérieurs et très estimables. Mais, tout en rejetant la possibilité d’un mariage qui lui eût paru une débauche sinistre et un vol, elle souffrait des familiarités, de la camaraderie des jeunes gens.

"La vue de Vénus, de ce coin voluptueux de l’Olympe, avait en effet ranimé le vieux sénateur. Il roulait des yeux charmés, se tournait à demi pour complimenter Saccard.

Haffner announced that he had just been named chairman of a jury that was to settle questions of indemnities. The conversation then turned to public works in the capital and in particular on the boulevard du Prince-Eugène, which had begun to attract public notice. Saccard seized the opportunity to speak of someone he knew who owned land that would no doubt be expropriated. He looked the assembled gentlemen in the face. The baron gently shook his head. M. Toutin-Laroche went so far as to say that nothing was more unpleasant than to have one’s property confiscated. M. Michelin nodded approvingly while trying even harder to squint at his decoration.","The sight of Venus, of this voluptuous corner of Olympus, had revived the old senator.

"— Non, dit-il nettement. Mais, si vous avez absolument besoin d’argent, je ne vous la défends pas.","""No,"" he said clearly. But, if you absolutely need the money, I do not forbid it.","“No,” he said curtly. “But if you’re in dire need of cash, I won’t forbid it.”","‘No,’ he replied simply. ‘But if you really need the money, I won’t forbid it.’"
"Cet hiver fut pour Renée une longue joie. Elle ne souffrait que du besoin d’argent. Maxime lui coûtait très cher ; il la traitait toujours en belle-maman, la laissait payer partout. Mais cette misère cachée était pour elle une volupté de plus. Elle s’ingéniait, se cassait la tête, pour que « son cher enfant » ne manquât de rien ; et quand elle avait décidé son mari à lui trouver quelques milliers de francs, elle les mangeait avec son amant, en folies coûteuses, comme deux écoliers lâchés dans leur première escapade. Lorsqu’ils n’avaient pas le sou, ils restaient à l’hôtel, ils jouissaient de cette grande bâtisse, d’un luxe si neuf et si insolemment bête. Le père n’était jamais là. Les amoureux gardaient le coin du feu plus souvent qu’autrefois. C’est que Renée avait enfin empli d’une jouissance chaude le vide glacial de ces plafonds dorés. Cette maison suspecte du plaisir mondain était devenue une chapelle où elle pratiquait à l’écart une nouvelle religion. Maxime ne mettait pas seulement en elle la note aiguë qui s’accordait avec ses toilettes folles ; il était l’amant fait pour cet hôtel, aux larges vitrines de magasin, et qu’un ruissellement de sculptures inondait des greniers aux caves ; il animait ces plâtras, depuis les deux Amours joufflus qui, dans la cour, laissaient tomber de leur coquille un filet d’eau, jusqu’aux grandes femmes nues soutenant les balcons et jouant au milieu des frontons avec des épis et des pommes ; il expliquait le vestibule trop riche, le jardin trop étroit, les pièces éclatantes où l’on voyait trop de fauteuils et pas un objet d’art. La jeune femme, qui s’y était mortellement ennuyée, s’y amusa tout d’un coup, en usa comme d’une chose dont elle n’avait pas d’abord compris l’emploi. Et ce ne fut pas seulement dans son appartement, dans le salon bouton d’or et dans la serre, qu’elle promena son amour, mais dans l’hôtel entier. Elle finit par se plaire même sur le divan du fumoir ; elle s’oubliait là, elle disait que cette pièce avait une vague odeur de tabac très agréable.","This winter was a long joy for Renee. She only suffered from the need for money. Maxime cost him dearly; he always treated her like a mother-in-law, let her pay everywhere. But this hidden misery was for her an additional pleasure. She contrived, racked her brains, so that ""her dear child"" lacked nothing; and when she had persuaded her husband to find a few thousand francs for her, she spent them with her lover, in costly follies, like two schoolboys let loose on their first escapade. When they had no money, they stayed at the hotel, they enjoyed this large building, a luxury so new and so insolently stupid. The father was never there. Lovers sat by the fireside more often than before. It was because Renée had finally filled the icy void of those gilded ceilings with a warm joy. This house suspected of worldly pleasure had become a chapel where she practiced a new religion apart. Maxime not only put in her the high note that went with her crazy clothes; he was the lover made for this mansion, with its large shop windows, and which a stream of sculptures flooded from the attics to the cellars; it animated these plasters, from the two chubby Cupids who, in the courtyard, let a trickle of water fall from their shells, to the tall naked women supporting the balconies and playing in the middle of the pediments with ears of corn and apples; he explained the vestibule which was too rich, the garden too narrow, the dazzling rooms in which one saw too many armchairs and not a work of art. The young woman, who had been mortally bored with it, suddenly amused herself with it, using it as if it were something the use of which she had not at first understood. And it was not only in her apartment, in the buttercup drawing room and in the greenhouse, that she took her love for a walk, but in the entire hotel. She ends up enjoying herself even on the divan in the smoking room; she forgot herself there, she said that this room had a very pleasant vague smell of tobacco.","For Renée that winter was one of endless joy. She suffered only from a shortage of cash. Maxime cost her an arm and a leg. He still treated her as his stepmother and allowed her to pay for everything. Yet her hidden poverty was for her merely one more source of pleasure. She schemed and racked her brain so that “her darling boy” would want for nothing, and when she persuaded her husband to come up with a few thousand francs for her, she and her lover devoured them in costly extravagances like two schoolmates let loose on their first escapade. When they hadn’t a cent to their name, they stayed home and enjoyed the huge, ugly mansion with its brand-new and impudently absurd luxury. Saccard was never there. The lovers sat by the hearth more often now than in the past, because Renée had at last succeeded in filling the glacial void under the mansion’s gilded ceilings with the heat of her ecstasy. This suspect house of worldly pleasure had become a chapel in which she practiced a new religion apart from the world. Maxime had done more for her than elicit a note of pleasure shrill enough to match her extravagant outfits; he was the lover this house required, with its storefront windows and its incrustation of sculpture from rooftop to cellar. He made all that plaster come alive, from the two chubby-cheeked cupids holding their dripping shell in the courtyard to the tall, naked women supporting the balconies and playing with apples and ears of corn in the pediments. He explained the all too sumptuous vestibule, the ridiculously constricted garden, and the splendid rooms crammed with armchairs but devoid of art. Renée, who had been bored to death there, suddenly brightened and began to use the house as if she had only just grasped its true purpose. And it was not only in her apartment that she paraded her love, not just in the buttercup salon or the conservatory, but throughout the house. Eventually she even found the divan in the smoking room to her liking. She enjoyed lying there, she said, because the room smelled vaguely of tobacco, which she found quite pleasant.","For Renée this same winter was a time of joy. She suffered only from a lack of ready money. Maxime proved a great expense; he still treated her as his stepmother, and let her pay wherever they went. But this secret poverty was for her one more delight. She taxed her ingenuity and racked her brains so that ‘her dear child’ would want for nothing; and when she had persuaded her husband to find her a few thousand francs, she ran through them with her lover in costly frivolities, like two schoolboys let out on their first escapade. When they had spent the last sou they stayed at home, revelling in the great piece of masonry built with such new and insolent luxury. The father was never there. The lovers sat by the fireside more often than before. The fact was that Renée had at last filled the emptiness of those gilded ceilings with the satisfaction of her desires. The disorderly house of worldly pleasure had become a chapel in which she secretly practised a new religion. Maxime struck in her not merely the shrill note that matched her extravagant costumes; he was a lover fashioned for this house, with its windows more like those of a department store and its flow of sculpture from the attic rooms down to the cellars; he gave life to all this plaster, from the two chubby Cupids in the courtyard, who exuded a sheet of water from their shell, to the great naked women who supported the balconies and played with apples and ears of corn amid the pediments; he gave meaning to the ornate hall, the narrow garden, the dazzling rooms which contained too many armchairs and not a single work of art. Renée, who had been bored to death in this house, began suddenly to take pleasure in it, using it as she might use something whose purpose she had not at first understood. It was not only in her own rooms, in her buttercup drawing room and in the hothouse that she pursued her love, but throughout the whole house. She even ended by taking her pleasure on the divan in the smoking room; she lingered there, saying that the room had a vague and very agreeable smell of tobacco."
"Les maçons enrichis reçurent béatement cette phrase en pleine poitrine.

"— Voyez-vous, disait-il, cette pièce doit être la salle des festins. Là, dans cet enfoncement du mur, il y avait certainement un immense divan.

"Un amour immense, un besoin de volupté, flottait dans cette nef close, où bouillait la sève ardente des tropiques. La jeune femme était prise dans ces noces puissantes de la terre, qui engendraient autour d’elle ces verdures noires, ces tiges colossales ; et les couches âcres de cette mer de feu, cet épanouissement de forêt, ce tas de végétations, toutes brûlantes des entrailles qui les nourrissaient, lui jetaient des effluves troublants, chargés d’ivresse. À ses pieds, le bassin, la masse d’eau chaude, épaissie par les sucs des racines flottantes, fumait, mettait à ses épaules un manteau de vapeurs lourdes, une buée qui lui chauffait la peau, comme l’attouchement d’une main moite de volupté. Sur sa tête, elle sentait le jet des Palmiers, les hauts feuillages secouant leur arôme. Et plus que l’étouffement chaud de l’air, plus que les clartés vives, plus que les fleurs larges, éclatantes, pareilles à des visages riant ou grimaçant entre les feuilles, c’étaient surtout les odeurs qui la brisaient. Un parfum indéfinissable, fort, excitant, traînait, fait de mille parfums : sueurs humaines, haleines de femmes, senteurs de chevelures ; et des souffles doux et fades jusqu’à l’évanouissement, étaient coupés par des souffles pestilentiels, rudes, chargés de poisons. Mais, dans cette musique étrange des odeurs, la phrase mélodique qui revenait toujours, dominant, étouffant les tendresses de la Vanille et les acuités des Orchidées, c’était cette odeur humaine, pénétrante, sensuelle, cette odeur d’amour qui s’échappe le matin de la chambre close de deux jeunes époux.","An immense love, a need for voluptuousness, floated in this closed nave, where the ardent sap of the tropics was boiling. The young woman was caught up in these powerful nuptials of the earth, which engendered around her these black verdures, these colossal stems; and the acrid strata of this sea of fire, this blossoming of forest, this heap of vegetation, all burning with the entrails which nourished them, gave him disturbing emanations, charged with intoxication. At his feet, the basin, the mass of hot water, thickened by the juices of the floating roots, steamed, put on his shoulders a mantle of heavy vapors, a mist that warmed his skin, like the touch of a hand. moist with voluptuousness. Over her head she felt the spray of Palm Trees, the tall foliage shaking their aroma. And more than the warm suffocation of the air, more than the bright lights, more than the large, dazzling flowers, like laughing or grimacing faces between the leaves, it was above all the smells that broke her. An indefinable perfume, strong, exciting, trailed, made up of a thousand perfumes: human sweat, women's breath, the scent of hair; and breaths soft and insipid to fainting, were cut by breaths pestilential, harsh, laden with poisons. But, in this strange music of smells, the melodic phrase that always came back, dominating, stifling the tenderness of Vanilla and the sharpness of Orchids, it was this human smell, penetrating, sensual, this smell of love which escapes the morning of the closed room of two young spouses.","An overwhelming love, a sensual need, suffused this sealed nave seething with the ardent sap of the tropics. The young woman was caught up in the potent nuptials of the earth itself—nuptials from which issued the dark vegetation and colossal shoots that surrounded her. From the acrid depths of this sea of fire, this sylvan luxuriance, this vegetal mass burning with the entrails on which it fed, troubling currents flowed into her, intoxicated her. At her feet, the pool of hot water thick with the juices of floating roots gave off steam, wreathing her shoulders in a mantle of heavy vapors, a mist that warmed her skin like the touch of a hand moist with desire. The smell of the palms, the aroma shed by the quivering foliage atop their tall trunks, swirled around her head. More than the stifling hot air, more than the bright lights, more than the huge, brilliant blossoms like faces laughing or grimacing among the leaves, it was above all the odors that overpowered her. An indefinable fragrance, powerful and exciting, lingered in the air, compounded of a thousand smells: of human sweat, the breath of women, the smell of hair. Sweet breezes, hints of fragrance faint to the point of vanishing, mixed with coarse, pestilential blasts, heavy with poison. In all this strange symphony of odors, however, the melodic phrase that came back again and again, dominating everything else, smothering the tenderness of the vanilla and the harshness of the orchids, was a sharp, sensual, human odor—the odor of love that filters out of the closed bedroom of a young married couple at daybreak.","Endless love and voluptuous appetite pervaded this stifling nave in which seethed the ardent sap of the tropics. Renée was wrapped in the powerful bridals of the earth that gave birth to these dark growths, these colossal stamina; and the acrid birth-throes of this hotbed, of this forest growth, of this mass of vegetation aglow with the entrails that nourished it, surrounded her with disturbing odours. At her feet was the steaming tank, its tepid water thickened by the sap from the floating roots, enveloping her shoulders with a mantle of heavy vapours, forming a mist that warmed her skin like the touch of a hand moist with desire. Overhead she could smell the palm trees, whose tall leaves shook down their aroma. And more than the stifling heat, more than the brilliant light, more than the great dazzling flowers, like faces laughing or grimacing between the leaves, it was the odours that overwhelmed her. An indescribable perfume, potent, exciting, composed of a thousand different perfumes, hung about her; human exudation, the breath of women, the scent of hair; and breezes sweet and swooningly faint were blended with breezes coarse and pestilential, laden with poison. But amid this strange music of odours, the dominant melody that constantly returned, stifling the sweetness of the vanilla and the orchids’ pungency, was the penetrating, sensual smell of flesh, the smell of lovemaking escaping in the early morning from the bedroom of newlyweds."
"— Là, ma toute belle, dit-elle en la faisant asseoir sur une chaise longue, nous allons pouvoir causer gentiment… Imaginez-vous que vous arrivez comme mars en carême. Je serais allée ce soir chez vous.","- There, my beautiful, she said, making her sit on a deck chair, we can talk nicely ... Imagine that you arrive like March in Lent.

Here, Saccard, look at that kitchen up there; there remains an old frying pan hanging above the stove… I can see it perfectly.","“Now there’s something really unusual,” said M. de Mareuil. “Look up there, Saccard, at that kitchen.

"Le fiacre traversait la place de la Madeleine. Renée songeait qu’elle n’était pas coupable. Elle n’avait pas voulu l’inceste. Et plus elle descendait en elle, plus elle se trouvait innocente, aux premières heures de son escapade, à sa sortie furtive du parc Monceau, chez Blanche Müller, sur le boulevard, même dans le cabinet du restaurant. Pourquoi donc était-elle tombée à genoux sur le bord de ce divan ? Elle ne savait plus. Elle n’avait certainement pas pensé une seconde à cela. Elle se serait refusée avec colère. C’était pour rire, elle s’amusait, rien de plus. Et elle retrouvait, dans le roulement du fiacre, cet orchestre assourdissant du boulevard, ce va-et-vient d’hommes et de femmes, tandis que des barres de feu brûlaient ses yeux fatigués.","The cab was crossing the Place de la Madeleine. Renée reflected that she was not guilty. She hadn't wanted the incest. And the deeper she sank into herself, the more she found herself innocent, in the early hours of her escapade, on her furtive exit from Parc Monceau, at Blanche Müller's, on the boulevard, even in the restaurant cabinet. Why had she fallen to her knees on the edge of this divan? She no longer knew. She certainly hadn't given a second thought to that. She would have angrily refused. It was for fun, she was having fun, nothing more.

"— Elle m’appelle son petit homme, tu sais, cette gamine ?","""She calls me her little man, you know, that kid?","Whenever she mentioned the girl to her lover, he laughed freely, repeated the child’s clever remarks, and told her that “the kid calls me her little man, you know.”","‘She calls me her little man, you know, the silly thing.’"
"Il resta blême, avec la honte de cette douleur qu’il sentait à ses poignets. Il la regardait aller et venir dans le cabinet.

"Paris s’abîmait alors dans un nuage de plâtre. Les temps prédits par Saccard, sur les buttes Montmartre, étaient venus. On taillait la cité à coups de sabre, et il était de toutes les entailles, de toutes les blessures. Il avait des décombres à lui aux quatre coins de la ville. Rue de Rome, il fut mêlé à cette étonnante histoire du trou qu’une compagnie creusa, pour transporter cinq ou six mille mètres cubes de terre et faire croire à des travaux gigantesques, et qu’on dut ensuite reboucher, en rapportant la terre de Saint-Ouen, lorsque la compagnie eut fait faillite. Lui s’en tira la conscience nette, les poches pleines, grâce à son frère Eugène, qui voulut bien intervenir. À Chaillot, il aida à éventrer la butte, à la jeter dans un bas-fond, pour faire passer le boulevard qui va de l’Arc de Triomphe au pont de l’Alma. Du côté de Passy, ce fut lui qui eut l’idée de semer les déblais du Trocadéro sur le plateau, de sorte que la bonne terre se trouve aujourd’hui à deux mètres de profondeur, et que l’herbe elle-même refuse de pousser dans ces gravats. On l’aurait retrouvé sur vingt points à la fois, à tous les endroits où il y avait quelque obstacle insurmontable, un déblai dont on ne savait que faire, un remblai qu’on ne pouvait exécuter, un bon amas de terre et de plâtras où s’impatientait la hâte fébrile des ingénieurs, que lui fouillait de ses ongles, et dans lequel il finissait toujours par trouver quelque pot-de-vin ou quelque opération de sa façon. Le même jour, il courait des travaux de l’Arc de Triomphe à ceux du boulevard Saint-Michel, des déblais du boulevard Malesherbes aux remblais de Chaillot, traînant avec lui une armée d’ouvriers, d’huissiers, d’actionnaires, de dupes et de fripons.","Paris then sank into a cloud of plaster. The times predicted by Saccard, on the Montmartre hills, had come. The city was cut with sabers, and he was in all the cuts, all the wounds. He had rubble all over town. Rue de Rome, he was involved in this astonishing story of the hole that a company dug, to transport five or six thousand cubic meters of earth and make believe in gigantic works, and which we then had to fill in, bringing back the earth from Saint-Ouen, when the company went bankrupt. He got away with a clear conscience, with his pockets full, thanks to his brother Eugene, who wanted to intervene. At Chaillot, he helped to rip open the mound, to throw it into a shoal, to pass the boulevard which goes from the Arc de Triomphe to the Pont de l'Alma. On the side of Passy, it was he who had the idea of sowing the rubble from the Trocadero on the plateau, so that the good soil is now two meters deep, and the grass itself refuses to push through this rubble. We would have found it at twenty points at the same time, at all the places where there was some insurmountable obstacle, a clearing which we did not know what to do with, an embankment which we could not execute, a good heap of earth and plaster. where the feverish haste of the engineers grew impatient, which he searched with his fingernails, and in which he always ended up finding some bribe or some operation of his own. On the same day, he ran from the works at the Arc de Triomphe to those on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, from the rubble of the Boulevard Malesherbes to the embankments of Chaillot, dragging with him an army of workmen, bailiffs, shareholders, dupes and rogues.","Paris was then disappearing in a cloud of plaster. The day that Saccard had predicted on the Buttes Montmartre had arrived. The city was being slashed with a saber, and he had a finger in every gash, in every wound. He owned piles of ruins in all quarters of the city. On the rue de Rome he was mixed up in the amazing story of the company that dug a hole and carted away five or six thousand cubic meters of soil so as to create the impression that it was involved in a gigantic project, and which then went bankrupt, so that the hole had to be filled in again with fill from Saint-Ouen. 5 Saccard escaped with a clear conscience and full pockets thanks to his brother Eugène, who was kind enough to intervene. At Chaillot 6 he helped to pare away the heights and cart them off as fill in order to make way for the boulevard that runs from the Arc de Triomphe to the Pont de l’Alma. Over toward Passy it was he who had the idea of covering the plateau with rubble from the Trocadéro,7 so that today the good soil lies two meters deep and nothing grows on the debris, not even weeds. He was in twenty places at once, wherever there was some insurmountable obstacle: dirt that nobody knew what to do with, an embankment that was impossible to build, a nice pile of soil and rubble that the engineers chafed to get out of the way— no matter what the mess, he would always dig his fingers into it and ultimately come away with a kickback or work out some kind of deal. In the course of a day he would race from construction sites around the Arc de Triomphe to others on the boulevard Saint-Michel, from the piles of rubble on the boulevard Malesherbes to the pits at Chaillot, dragging an army of workmen, law clerks, stockholders, dupes, and scoundrels in his wake.","Paris was at that time disappearing in a cloud of plaster-dust. The time predicted by Saccard on the Buttes Montmartre had come. The city was being slashed with sabre-cuts, and he had played a part in every gash. He owned demolished houses in every neighbourhood. In the Rue de Rome he was mixed up in the amazing story of the pit which was dug by a company in order to remove five or six thousand cubic metres of soil and create a belief that great works were in progress, and which had afterwards to be filled in when the company went bankrupt, by bringing the soil back from Saint-Ouen. Saccard came out of it with an easy conscience and full pockets, thanks to the benign intervention of his brother Eugène. At Chaillot he assisted in cutting through the heights and throwing them into a hollow in order to make way for the boulevard that runs from the Arc de Triomphe to the Pont de l’Alma. * In Passy it was he who conceived the idea of scattering the rubbish from the Trocadéro over the high ground, so that to this day the good soil is buried two metres below the surface and the weeds refuse to grow through the rubbish. He was to be found in twenty places at once, at every spot where there was some insurmountable obstacle, a heap of rubbish no one knew what to do with, a hollow that could not be filled up, a great mass of soil and plaster over which the engineers in their haste had lost patience, but in which he rummaged with his nails and invariably ended by finding some profit or some speculation to his taste. On the same day he would run from the works at the Arc de Triomphe to those at the Boulevard Saint-Michel, from the clearings in the Boulevard Malesherbes to the embankments at Chaillot, dragging after him an army of workmen, lawyers, shareholders, dupes, and swindlers."

"La jeune femme, en se retournant, aperçut Charles, qui regardait autour de lui, flairant. Il finit par apercevoir le ruban bleu de Renée, froissé, oublié sur un coin du divan.

"Les allées étaient désertes. Les grands feuillages dormaient, et, sur la nappe lourde du bassin, deux boutons de nymphéa s’épanouissaient lentement.

"M. Hupel de la Noue, de l’embrasure où il avait poussé les Mignon et Charrier, jetait des coups d’œil inquiets sur le groupe formé autour des deux jeunes femmes ; il craignait qu’on ne s’y moquât de lui. Les autres nymphes arrivèrent les unes après les autres ; toutes avaient repris leurs costumes de pierres précieuses ; la comtesse Vanska, en Corail, eut un succès fou, lorsqu’on put examiner de près les ingénieux détails de sa robe. Puis Maxime entra, correct dans son habit noir, l’air souriant ; et un flot de femmes l’enveloppa, on le mit au centre du cercle, on le plaisanta sur son rôle de fleur, sur sa passion des miroirs ; lui, sans un embarras, comme charmé de son personnage, continuait à sourire, répondait aux plaisanteries, avouait qu’il s’adorait et qu’il était assez guéri des femmes pour se préférer à elles. On riait plus haut, le groupe grandissait, tenait tout le milieu du salon, tandis que le jeune homme, noyé dans ce peuple d’épaules, dans ce tohu-bohu de costumes éclatants, gardait son parfum d’amour monstrueux, sa douceur vicieuse de fleur blonde.","M. Hupel de la Noue, from the embrasure into which he had pushed the Mignons and Charrier, cast anxious glances at the group formed around the two young women; he was afraid that they would make fun of him there. The other nymphs arrived one after another; all had resumed their costumes of precious stones; the Countess Vanska, in Coral, had a wild success, when one could closely examine the ingenious details of her dress. Then Maxime came in, correct in his black coat, smiling; and a crowd of women surrounded him, they put him in the center of the circle, they joked about his role as a flower, about his passion for mirrors; he, without any embarrassment, as if charmed with his character, continued to smile, replied to jokes, confessed that he adored himself and that he was sufficiently cured of women to prefer himself to them. We laughed louder, the group grew, held the whole middle of the living room, while the young man, drowned in this crowd of shoulders, in this hustle and bustle of dazzling costumes, kept his scent of monstrous love, his vicious sweetness. of blonde flower.","From the recess to which he had taken Mignon and Charrier, M. Hupel de la Noue cast worried glances at the group that had formed around the two young women. He was afraid they might be making fun of him. The other nymphs made their way down one by one.

Countess Wanska, dressed as Coral, was rated a stunning success when the guests were able to get a close look at the ingenious details of her gown. Then Maxime came in, impeccably attired in a dark frock coat and wearing a smile on his face. A torrent of women engulfed him, formed a circle around him, and teased him about his role as a flower and his passion for mirrors. And he, without a flicker of embarrassment, as if charmed by his character, continued to smile, responded to all the teasing comments, and admitted that he adored himself and had gotten over his weakness for women sufficiently that he now preferred himself to them. The laughter grew louder, and the group grew larger until it occupied the whole center of the drawing room, while the young man, lost amid this sea of shoulders, this chaos of dazzling costumes, retained a perfume of depraved love, the sweetness of a poisonous blossom.","From the recess into which he had driven Mignon and Charrier, Monsieur Hupel de la Noue kept glancing at the group that had formed round the two ladies; he was afraid they were laughing at him.

"Maxime retint une impertinence ; il allait dire qu’elle s’était sans doute crue plus vieille d’un mois, en avouant M. de Saffré pour amant. Il n’eut que le sourire mauvais de cette méchanceté, et, jetant son cigare dans le feu, il vint s’asseoir de l’autre côté de la cheminée. Là, il parla raison, il donna à entendre à Renée qu’ils devaient rester bons camarades. Les regards fixes de la jeune femme l’embarrassaient un peu, pourtant ; il n’osa pas lui annoncer son mariage. Elle le contemplait longuement, les yeux encore gonflés par les larmes. Elle le trouvait pauvre, étroit, méprisable, et elle l’aimait toujours, de cette tendresse qu’elle avait pour ses dentelles. Il était joli sous la lumière du candélabre, placé au bord de la cheminée, à côté de lui. Comme il renversait la tête, la lueur des bougies lui dorait les cheveux, lui glissait sur la face, dans le duvet léger des joues, avec des blondeurs charmantes.","Maxime restrained an impertinence; he was about to say that she had doubtless thought herself a month older when she confessed M. de Saffré as her lover. He only smiled wickedly at this wickedness, and, throwing his cigar into the fire, he came and sat down on the other side of the fireplace. There he spoke reason, he gave Renée to understand that they should remain good comrades. The stares of the young woman embarrassed him a little, however; he dared not announce his marriage to her. She stared at him for a long time, her eyes still swollen with tears. She thought him poor, cramped, contemptible, and she still loved him with that fondness she had for his lace. It was pretty in the light of the candelabra, placed on the edge of the fireplace, beside him. As he threw back his head, the candlelight gilded his hair, slipped over his face, into the light down of his cheeks, with charming blondness.","Maxime checked himself as he was about to make an impertinent remark: he’d been on the point of saying that if she’d waited a month, she’d probably have been right in naming M. de Saffré as her lover. But he satisfied himself with a wicked smile at this nasty thought, tossed his cigar into the fire, and sat down at the other end of the hearth. He talked reason and hinted that they ought to remain good friends. The young woman’s fixed stare rather embarrassed him, though. He didn’t dare announce his marriage to her now. She contemplated him for a good long while through eyes still swollen from tears. Although she found him wretched, narrow, and contemptible, she loved him still, as tenderly as she loved her daintiest lace. He looked pretty in the light of the candelabra sitting on the edge of the hearth alongside him. When he threw back his head, the light from the candles gilded his hair and imparted to the soft down of his cheeks a charming auburn glow.","Maxime refrained from being impertinent; he was on the point of saying that she was no doubt only anticipating things by a month when she confessed that Monsieur de Saffré was her lover. He smiled wickedly at this spiteful idea, and tossing his cigar into the fire, sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace. There he talked common sense, giving Renée to understand that they must remain good friends. Her stare embarrassed him, but he did not have the courage to tell her of his forthcoming marriage. She gazed at him, her eyes still swollen with tears. She thought him a poor creature, narrow-minded and contemptible, and yet she loved him, as she might love her lace. He looked handsome in the light of the candelabra on the mantelpiece, next to him. As he threw back his head, the light of the candles tinged his hair with gold and glided over the soft down on his cheeks, creating a charming effect."
"C’était un bruit assourdissant, une mêlée confuse où elle ne distingua d’abord que des jupes volantes et des jambes noires piétinant et tournant. La voix de M. de Saffré criait : « Le Changement de dames ! Le Changement de dames ! » Et les couples passaient au milieu d’une fine poussière jaune ; chaque cavalier, après avoir fait trois ou quatre tours de valse, jetait sa dame aux bras de son voisin, qui lui jetait la sienne. La baronne de Meinhold, dans son costume d’Émeraude, tombait des mains du comte de Chibray aux mains de M. Simpson ; il la rattrapait au petit bonheur, par une épaule, tandis que le bout de ses gants glissait sous le corsage. La comtesse Vanska, rouge, faisant sonner ses pendeloques de corail, allait, d’un bond, de la poitrine de M. de Saffré, sur la poitrine du duc de Rozan, qu’elle enlaçait, qu’elle forçait à pirouetter pendant cinq mesures, pour se pendre ensuite à la hanche de M. Simpson, qui venait de lancer l’Émeraude au conducteur du cotillon. Et Mme Teissière, Mme Daste, Mme de Lauwerens, luisaient comme de grands joyaux vivants, avec la pâleur blonde de la Topaze, le bleu tendre de la Turquoise, le bleu ardent du Saphir, s’abandonnaient un instant, se cambraient sous le poignet tendu d’un valseur, puis repartaient, arrivaient de dos ou de face dans une nouvelle étreinte, visitaient à la file toutes les embrassades d’hommes du salon. Cependant, Mme d’Espanet, devant l’orchestre, avait réussi à saisir Mme Haffner au passage, et valsait avec elle, sans vouloir la lâcher. L’Or et l’Argent dansaient ensemble, amoureusement.","It was a deafening noise, a confused melee where at first she could only make out flying skirts and black legs stomping and turning. M. de Saffré's voice cried: ""The Change of Ladies!"" Change of ladies! And the couples passed through a fine yellow dust; each cavalier, after having made three or four turns of the waltz, threw his lady into the arms of his neighbour, who threw his own. The Baroness de Meinhold, in her Emerald costume, fell from the hands of the Earl of Chibray into the hands of Mr. Simpson; he caught her haphazardly, by one shoulder, while the tips of her gloves slipped under her bodice. The Countess Vanska, flushed, ringing her coral pendants, leaped from M. de Saffré's chest to the Duc de Rozan's chest, embracing him, forcing him to pirouette for five measures, to then hang himself on the hip of Mr. Simpson, who had just thrown the Emerald to the conductor of the cotillion. And Mme Teissière, Mme Daste, Mme de Lauwerens, shone like great living jewels, with the blond pallor of Topaz, the tender blue of Turquoise, the fiery blue of Sapphire, let themselves go for a moment, arched under the wrist stretched with a waltz, then set off again, arriving from the back or the front in a new embrace, visiting in a row all the embraces of men in the drawing-room. However, Madame d'Espanet, in front of the orchestra, had succeeded in seizing Madame Haffner as she passed, and was waltzing with her, without wanting to let her go. The Gold and the Silver danced together, lovingly.","There was a deafening noise, a chaotic free-for-all in which all she could make out at first were flying skirts and black legs stamping and whirling. M. de Saffré ’s voice cried out: “Change your ladies! Change your ladies!” And couples passed by in a cloud of fine yellow dust. Each gentleman danced three or four turns of the waltz and then flung his lady into the arms of his neighbor, who did the same. Baroness von Meinhold, wearing her Emerald costume, passed from the hands of the comte de Chibray to those of Mr. Simpson. He caught her as best he could by one shoulder, while the fingers of his gloves slipped beneath her bodice. A flushed Countess Wanska, her coral pendants jangling, leapt in a single bound from the chest of M. de Saffré to that of the duc de Rozan, whom she wrapped herself around and forced to pirouette for five measures so that she might attach herself next to the hip of Mr. Simpson, who had just hurled the Emerald at the cotillion’s leader. And Mme Teissière, Mme Daste, and Mme de Lauwerens, gleaming like great living jewels with the pale yellow of Topaz, the soft blue of Turquoise, and the fiery blue of Sapphire, briefly let themselves go and arched their backs under the outstretched wrists of their waltzing partners, then started up anew, moving backward or forward into yet another embrace, and in this fashion sampled one after another the arms of every man in the room. Meanwhile, Mme d’Espanet, standing in front of the orchestra, managed to grab Mme Haffner as she passed and waltzed off with her, unwilling to let her go. Gold and Silver danced together, like lovers.","The noise was deafening, there was a confused mêlée in which at first she could make out nothing but flying skirts and prancing black legs. Monsieur de Saffré s voice cried, ‘Change your partners! Change your partners!’ The couples passed by amid a fine yellow dust; each gentleman, after three or four turns in the waltz, threw his partner into the arms of his neighbour, who in turn threw him his. Baroness de Meinhold, in her costume as the Emerald, fell from the hands of the Comte de Chibray into the hands of Mr Simpson; he caught her as best he could by the shoulder, while the tips of his gloves glided under her bodice. The Comtesse Vanska, flushed, jingling her coral pendants, went with a bound from the chest of Monsieur de Saffré to the chest of the Duc de Rozan, whom she entwined in her arms and compelled to hop round for five turns, when she hung onto the hips of Mr Simpson, who had just flung the Emerald to the leader of the cotillon. Madame Teissière, Madame Daste, and Madame de Lauwerens shone like large, live jewels, with the blond pallor of the Topaz, the blue of the Turquoise, and the bright blue of the Sapphire; they had moments of abandonment, curved under a waltzer’s outstretched wrist, then set off again, fell backwards or forwards into a fresh embrace, found themselves successively in the arms of every man in the room. However, Madame d’Espanet, standing in front of the band, had succeeded in catching hold of Madame Haffner as she sped by, and now waltzed with her, refusing to let her go. Gold and Silver danced lovingly together."
"Cependant, les convives ne mangeaient plus. Un vent chaud semblait avoir soufflé sur la table, terni les verres, émietté le pain, noirci les pelures de fruit dans les assiettes, rompu la belle symétrie du service. Les fleurs se fanaient dans les grands cornets d’argent ciselé. Et les convives s’oubliaient là un instant, en face des débris du dessert, béats, sans courage pour se lever. Un bras sur la table, à demi penchés, ils avaient le regard vide, le vague affaissement de cette ivresse mesurée et décente des gens du monde qui se grisent à petits coups. Les rires étaient tombés, les paroles se faisaient rares. On avait bu et mangé beaucoup, ce qui rendait plus grave encore la bande des hommes décorés. Les dames, dans l’air alourdi de la salle, sentaient des moiteurs leur monter au front et à la nuque. Elles attendaient qu’on passât au salon, sérieuses, un peu pâles, comme si leur tête eût légèrement tourné. Mme d’Espanet était toute rose, tandis que les épaules de Mme Haffner avaient pris des blancheurs de cire. Cependant, M. Hupel de la Noue examinait le manche d’un couteau ; M. Toutin-Laroche lançait encore à M. Haffner des lambeaux de phrase, que celui-ci accueillait par des hochements de tête ; M. de Mareuil rêvait en regardant M. Michelin, qui lui souriait finement. Quant à la jolie Mme Michelin, elle ne parlait plus depuis longtemps ; très rouge, elle laissait pendre sous la nappe une main que M. de Saffré devait tenir dans la sienne, car il s’appuyait gauchement sur le bord de la table, les sourcils tendus, avec la grimace d’un homme qui résout un problème d’algèbre. Mme Sidonie avait vaincu, elle aussi ; les sieurs Mignon et Charrier, accoudés tous deux et tournés vers elle, paraissaient ravis de recevoir ses confidences ; elle avouait qu’elle adorait le laitage et qu’elle avait peur des revenants. Et Aristide Saccard, lui-même, les yeux demi-clos, plongé dans cette béatitude d’un maître de maison qui a conscience d’avoir grisé honnêtement ses convives, ne songeait point à quitter la table ; il contemplait avec une tendresse respectueuse le baron Gouraud, appesanti, digérant, allongeant sur la nappe blanche sa main droite, une main de vieillard sensuel, courte, épaisse, tachée de plaques violettes et couverte de poils roux.","However, the guests were no longer eating. A warm wind seemed to have blown across the table, dulled the glasses, crumbled the bread, blackened the fruit peels on the plates, broken the beautiful symmetry of the service. The flowers were fading in the great chiselled silver cones. And the guests forgot themselves there for a moment, facing the debris of the dessert, blissful, without the courage to get up. One arm on the table, half bent over, they had a vacant stare, the vague drooping of that measured and decent intoxication of people in the world who intoxicate themselves little by little. The laughter had died down, the words were rare. We had eaten and drunk a lot, which made the band of decorated men even more serious. The ladies, in the heavy air of the hall, felt dampness rise to their foreheads and necks. They were waiting for us to come into the drawing-room, serious, a little pale, as if their heads had turned slightly. Madame d'Espanet was quite rosy, while Madame Haffner's shoulders had taken on the whiteness of wax. Meanwhile, M. Hupel de la Noue was examining the handle of a knife; M. Toutin-Laroche threw more shreds of sentences at M. Haffner, which the latter received with nods of the head; M. de Mareuil dreamed as he looked at M. Michelin, who smiled at him shrewdly. As for the pretty Madame Michelin, she had not spoken for a long time; very red, she let a hand dangle under the tablecloth that M. de Saffré must have held in his, for he was leaning awkwardly on the edge of the table, his eyebrows raised, with the grimace of a man solving a problem of algebra. Madame Sidonie had won, too; Monsieurs Mignon and Charrier, both leaning on their elbows and facing her, seemed delighted to receive her confidences; she confessed that she loved dairy and was afraid of ghosts. And Aristide Saccard himself, his eyes half-closed, immersed in the bliss of a householder who is conscious of having honestly intoxicated his guests, never dreamed of leaving the table; he gazed with respectful tenderness on Baron Gouraud, weighed down, digesting, stretching out his right hand on the white tablecloth, the hand of a sensual old man, short, thick, stained with patches of violet and covered with red hair.","Meanwhile the guests had stopped eating. A hot wind seemed to have grazed the table, clouding the glasses, leaving the bread in crumbs, darkening the skins of the fruits on their plates, and disrupting the pleasing symmetry of the settings. The flowers spilling out of the great cornucopias of chased silver wilted. And for a moment, the guests, staring vacantly at what was left of dessert, forgot themselves and remained seated, lacking the heart to get up. Leaning on one elbow, they sat with the blank faces and vague lassitude of fashionable people whose drunkenness takes a measured and respectable form, who get sloshed one sip at a time. The laughs had subsided, and talk had become rare. Having drunk and eaten a good deal, the group of bemedaled gentlemen seemed graver than ever. In the heavy air of the dining room, the ladies felt their foreheads and the backs of their necks grow moist. Waiting to move into the drawing room, they seemed serious and a little pale, as though they felt a bit faint. Mme d’Espanet had turned quite pink, while Mme Haffner’s shoulders had taken on a waxy white sheen. Meanwhile, M. Hupel de la Noue examined the handle of a knife; M. Toutin-Laroche continued to spit fragmentary comments at M. Haffner, who received them with much nodding of his head; M. de Mareuil stared dreamily at M. Michelin, who returned the look with an arch smile. As for the delectable Mme Michelin, she had long since stopped talking. Looking quite flushed, she had allowed one of her hands to dangle beneath the tablecloth, where M. de Saffré was no doubt holding it in his as he leaned awkwardly against the table’s edge, his eyebrows knit with the grimace of a man solving a problem in algebra. Mme Sidonie had also made a conquest. Mignon and Charrier, both leaning on their elbows and facing her, seemed delighted to share her confidences. She confessed that she adored dairy products and was afraid of ghosts. And Aristide Saccard himself, eyes half-closed, reveled in the smug satisfaction of a host confident of having properly lubricated his guests and gave no thought to leaving the table. With a respectfully affectionate eye he contemplated Baron Gouraud, who was ponderously digesting his dinner while his right hand lay splayed across the white tablecloth— the hand of a sensual old man, small, thick-fingered, discolored by purple blotches, and covered with red hair.","Meanwhile the guests had stopped eating. A hot breath seemed to have passed over the table, clouding the glasses, crumbling the bread, blackening the fruit-peel on the plates, and destroying the symmetry of the cloth. The flowers drooped in the great horn of chased silver, and the guests sat drowsily before the remains of the dessert, lacking the energy to rise from their seats. Leaning half forward, with one arm resting on the table, they had the blank look, the general air of exhaustion, that accompanies the cautious, circumspect inebriation of men and women of fashion getting tipsy by degrees. The laughter had subsided and the chatter had ceased. Much had been drunk and eaten, and the men with decorations* were more solemn than ever. In the heavy atmosphere of the room, the ladies could feel the beads of perspiration on their necks and temples. They awaited the signal to adjourn to the drawing room, serious, a little pale, as if their heads were gently swimming. Madame d’Espanet was very pink, while Madame Haffner’s shoulders had assumed a waxen whiteness. Monsieur Hupel de la Noue was examining the handle of his knife; Monsieur Toutin-Laroche continued to toss disconnected sentences at Monsieur Haffner, who wagged his head in reply; Monsieur de Mareuil was dreaming, his eyes fixed on Monsieur de Michelin, who smiled at him archly. As for the pretty Madame Michelin, she had long since stopped talking; very red in the face, she kept one hand under the table, where it was doubtless held by Monsieur de Saffré, who leant forward awkwardly, with knitted eyebrows and the grimace of a man solving an algebraical problem. Madame Sidonie, too, had made her conquests: Mignon and Charrier, both leaning on their elbows with their faces turned towards her, seemed enraptured to receive her confidences; she confessed that she loved everything made with milk, and that she was frightened of ghosts. Aristide Saccard, his eyes half closed, sunk in the beatitude of a host who realizes that he has made his guests thoroughly drunk, had no thought of leaving the table; with respectful fondness he watched Baron Gouraud laboriously digesting his dinner , his right hand spread over the white cloth; it was the hand of a sensual old man, short, thick-set, and covered with purple blotches and short red hairs."
Mais Charrier était plus dégrossi. Il acheva son verre de pommard et trouva le moyen de faire une phrase :,But Charrier was rougher. He finished his glass of pommard and found a way to make a sentence:,"Charrier was more polished. While finishing his glass of Pommard, he managed to come up with a phrase: “The renewal of Paris has been the lifeblood of the working man.”",But Charrier was not so clumsy. He drank his glass of Pomard and managed to deliver himself of a sentence:
"À peine nous sortions des portes de Trézène,","Hardly had we left the gates of Troezen,","Scarcely had we issued from Troezen’s gates, He on his chariot mounted .","Scarce had we issued forth from Troezen’s gates,"
"Saccard maquignonna une grosse affaire avec la Ville. Celle-ci, obérée[22] , écrasée par sa dette, entraînée dans cette danse des millions qu’elle avait mise en branle, pour plaire à l’empereur et remplir certaines poches, en était réduite aux emprunts déguisés, ne voulant pas avouer ses fièvres chaudes, sa folie de la pioche et du moellon. Elle venait de créer alors ce qu’on nommait des bons de délégation, de véritables lettres de change à longue date, pour payer les entrepreneurs, le jour même de la signature des traités, et leur permettre ainsi de trouver des fonds en négociant les bons. Le Crédit viticole avait gracieusement accepté ce papier de la main des entrepreneurs. Le jour où la Ville manqua d’argent, Saccard alla la tenter. Une somme considérable lui fut avancée, sur une émission de bons de délégation, que M. Toutin-Laroche jura tenir de compagnies concessionnaires, et qu’il traîna dans tous les ruisseaux de la spéculation. Le Crédit viticole était désormais inattaquable ; il tenait Paris à la gorge. Le directeur ne parlait plus qu’avec un sourire de la fameuse Société générale des ports du Maroc ; elle vivait pourtant toujours, et les journaux continuaient à célébrer régulièrement les grandes stations commerciales. Un jour que M. Toutin-Laroche engageait Saccard à prendre des actions de cette société, celui-ci lui rit au nez, en lui demandant s’il le croyait assez bête pour placer son argent dans la « Compagnie générale des Mille et une Nuits ».","Saccard brokered a big deal with the City. The latter, burdened [22] , crushed by its debt, involved in this dance of the millions which it had set in motion, to please the emperor and to fill certain pockets, was reduced to disguised loans, not wanting to admit his hot fevers, his madness for the pickaxe and the rubble. It had then just created what were called delegation vouchers, veritable long-standing bills of exchange, to pay entrepreneurs on the very day of the signing of the treaties, and thus enable them to find funds by negotiating the vouchers . The Crédit viticole had graciously accepted this paper from the hands of the entrepreneurs. The day the City ran out of money, Saccard went to tempt it. A considerable sum was advanced to him, on an issue of delegation bonds, which M. Toutin-Laroche swore he had obtained from concessionary companies, and which he dragged through all the streams of speculation. The Crédit Viticole was henceforth unassailable; he had Paris by the throat. The director spoke only with a smile of the famous Société Générale des Ports du Maroc; it was still alive, however, and the newspapers continued to cover the great commercial stations regularly. One day when Mr. Toutin-Laroche urged Saccard to take shares in this company, the latter laughed in his face, asking him if he thought him stupid enough to invest his money in the ""Compagnie generale des Mille et une Nuits"". "".","Saccard worked a huge swindle on city hall. Oppressed and overburdened by debt, the city, having been dragged into the dance of millions that it had set in motion to please the Emperor and line certain pockets, was reduced to borrowing money in secret so as not to be obliged to confess its own raging fever, its obsession with pickaxe and quarry stone. It had just invented something called delegation bonds, long-term letters of exchange, with which it could pay contractors on the day that papers were signed so that they could then sell the notes at a discount in exchange for needed funds. The Crédit Viticole had graciously accepted this paper from the contractors. The day the city ran short of money, Saccard tried putting temptation in its way. A considerable sum of money was advanced on the security of delegation bonds that M. Toutin-Laroche swore he had obtained from companies doing business with the city, and which he dragged through all the gutters of speculation. The Crédit Viticole was thereafter safe from attack; it held Paris by the throat. From then on the managing director never spoke about the famous Société Générale des Ports du Maroc without a smile. It still existed, however, and the newspapers continued to celebrate the great commercial stations at regular intervals. One day, when M. Toutin-Laroche urged Saccard to take some shares of the company, the latter laughed in his face and asked if he, Toutin-Laroche, thought him fool enough to invest his money in the “The Arabian Nights, Inc.”","Saccard carried through a big job with the City. The latter was seriously in debt, dragged into this dance of gold which it had led off to please the Emperor and to line certain people’s pockets, and was now reduced to borrowing covertly, not caring to confess its violent fever, its stone-and-pickaxe madness. It had begun to issue what were called delegation bonds,* really post-dated bills of exchange, so that the contractors might be paid on the day the agreements were signed, and thus enabled to obtain money by discounting the bonds. The Crédit Viticole had graciously accepted this paper at the contractors’ hands. One day when the City was in need of money, Saccard went and tempted it. It received a considerable advance on an issue of delegation bonds, which Monsieur Toutin-Laroche swore he held from contracting companies, and which he dragged through every gutter of speculation.

"L’appartement particulier de Renée était un nid de soie et de dentelle, une merveille de luxe coquet. Un boudoir très petit précédait la chambre à coucher. Les deux pièces n’en faisaient qu’une, ou du moins le boudoir n’était guère que le seuil de la chambre, une grande alcôve, garnie de chaises longues, sans porte pleine, fermée par une double portière. Les murs, dans l’une et l’autre pièces, se trouvaient également tendus d’une étoffe de soie mate gris de lin, brochée d’énormes bouquets de roses, de lilas blancs et de boutons d’or. Les rideaux et portières étaient en guipure de Venise, posée sur une doublure de soie, faite de bandes alternativement grises et roses. Dans la chambre à coucher, la cheminée en marbre blanc, un véritable joyau, étalait, comme une corbeille de fleurs, ses incrustations de lapis et de mosaïques précieuses, reproduisant les roses, les lilas blancs et les boutons d’or de la tenture. Un grand lit gris et rose, dont on ne voyait pas le bois recouvert d’étoffe et capitonné, et dont le chevet s’appuyait au mur, emplissait toute une moitié de la chambre avec son flot de draperies, ses guipures et sa soie brochée de bouquets, tombant du plafond jusqu’au tapis. On aurait dit une toilette de femme, arrondie, découpée, accompagnée de poufs, de nœuds, de volants ; et ce large rideau qui se gonflait, pareil à une jupe, faisait rêver à quelque grande amoureuse, penchée, se pâmant, près de choir sur les oreillers. Sous les rideaux, c’était un sanctuaire, des batistes plissées à petits plis, une neige de dentelles, toutes sortes de choses délicates et transparentes, qui se noyaient dans un demi-jour religieux. À côté du lit, de ce monument dont l’ampleur dévote rappelait une chapelle ornée pour quelque fête, les autres meubles disparaissaient : des sièges bas, une psyché de deux mètres, des meubles pourvus d’une infinité de tiroirs. À terre, le tapis, d’un gris bleuâtre, était semé de roses pâles effeuillées. Et, aux deux côtés du lit, il y avait deux grandes peaux d’ours noir, garnies de velours rose, aux ongles d’argent, et dont les têtes, tournées vers la fenêtre, regardaient fixement le ciel vide de leurs yeux de verre.","Renée's private apartment was a nest of silk and lace, a marvel of coquettish luxury. A very small boudoir preceded the bedroom. The two rooms were one, or at least the boudoir was little more than the threshold of the bedroom, a large alcove furnished with chaise-longues, without solid door, closed by a double door. The walls, in both rooms, were likewise hung with a dull linen-gray silk stuff, brocaded with enormous bouquets of roses, white lilacs, and buttercups. The curtains and portieres were of Venetian guipure, placed on a silk lining, made of alternately gray and pink bands. In the bedroom, the white marble fireplace, a real gem, spread out, like a basket of flowers, its inlays of lapis and precious mosaics, reproducing the roses, white lilacs and buttercups of the hangings. A large gray and pink bed, the wood of which was covered with stuff and upholstered, and whose headboard leaned against the wall, filled a whole half of the room with its flood of draperies, its guipures and its brocaded silk. of bouquets, falling from the ceiling to the carpet. It looked like a woman's toilet, rounded, cut, accompanied by poufs, bows, flounces; and this large billowing curtain, like a skirt, made some great lover dream, leaning over, swooning, almost falling on the pillows. Beneath the curtains, there was a sanctuary, batistes pleated with little folds, a snow of lace, all sorts of delicate and transparent things, which were drowned in a religious half-light. Beside the bed, of this monument whose devout scale recalled a chapel adorned for some feast, the other pieces of furniture disappeared: low chairs, a two-meter high mirror, pieces of furniture provided with an infinity of drawers. On the ground, the carpet, a bluish gray, was strewn with pale, leafless roses. And, on both sides of the bed, there were two large black bear skins, trimmed with pink velvet, with silver nails, and whose heads, turned towards the window, gazed fixedly at the empty sky with their glass eyes. .","Renée’s private apartment was a nest of silk and lace, a marvel of stylish luxury.

The window and door curtains were of Venetian lace lined with alternating strips of gray and pink silk. In the bedroom, the white marble fireplace, a veritable jewel, was encrusted with lapis lazuli and precious mosaics that repeated the roses, white lilacs, and buttercups of the tapestry, displayed as in a bed of flowers.

It resembled a woman’s gown, rounded, patterned, and trimmed with puffs, bows, and flounces. The ample curtain, swelling out like a skirt, suggested a great lady in love—leaning back, swooning, almost collapsing onto the pillows. Beneath the curtain was a sanctuary of pleated linen and snowy lace, all sorts of delicate and transparent things bathed in a religious twilight. Alongside the bed—a monument whose devout splendor called to mind a chapel decked out for some holy day or other—the rest of the furniture was of no account: some low chairs, a full-length cheval glass, and various dressers with an infinite number of drawers. The blue-gray carpet featured a pattern of pale roses in full bloom, and on either side of the bed lay great black bearskin rugs trimmed with pink velvet and silver claws, positioned so that the bears’ heads faced the window and stared through glass eyes at the empty sky.","Renée’s private apartment was a nest of silk and lace, a marvel of luxurious coquetry.

"Pour gazon, une large bande de Sélaginelle entourait le bassin. Cette fougère naine formait un épais tapis de mousse, d’un vert tendre. Et, au-delà de la grande allée circulaire, quatre énormes massifs allaient d’un élan vigoureux jusqu’au cintre : les Palmiers, légèrement penchés dans leur grâce, épanouissaient leurs éventails, étalaient leurs têtes arrondies, laissaient pendre leurs palmes, comme des avirons lassés par leur éternel voyage dans le bleu de l’air ; les grands Bambous de l’Inde montaient droits, frêles et durs, faisant tomber de haut leur pluie légère de feuilles ; un Ravenala, l’arbre du voyageur, dressait son bouquet d’immenses écrans chinois ; et, dans un coin, un Bananier, chargé de ses fruits, allongeait de toutes parts ses longues feuilles horizontales, où deux amants pourraient se coucher à l’aise en se serrant l’un contre l’autre. Aux angles, il y avait des Euphorbes d’Abyssinie, ces cierges épineux, contrefaits, pleins de bosses honteuses, suant le poison. Et, sous les arbres, pour couvrir le sol, des fougères basses, les Adiantum, les Ptérides mettaient leurs dentelles délicates, leurs fines découpures. Les Alsophila, d’espèce plus haute, étageaient leurs rangs de rameaux symétriques, sexangulaires, si réguliers, qu’on aurait dit de grandes pièces de faïence destinées à contenir les fruits de quelque dessert gigantesque. Puis, une bordure de Bégonia et de Caladium entourait les massifs ; les Bégonia, à feuilles torses, tachées superbement de vert et de rouge ; les Caladium, dont les feuilles en fer de lance, blanches et à nervures vertes, ressemblent à de larges ailes de papillon ; plantes bizarres dont le feuillage vit étrangement, avec un éclat sombre ou pâlissant de fleurs malsaines.","For lawn, a large strip of selaginella surrounded the pool. This dwarf fern formed a thick carpet of soft green moss. And, beyond the great circular aisle, four enormous clumps went vigorously up to the arch: the Palm Trees, slightly leaning in their grace, spread their fans, spread their rounded heads, let their palms hang down, like oars wearied by their eternal journey in the blue of the air; the great Bamboos of India rose straight, frail and hard, sending down from above their light rain of leaves; a Ravenala, the traveller's tree, erected its bouquet of immense Chinese screens; and, in a corner, a banana tree, laden with its fruit, stretched out its long horizontal leaves on all sides, where two lovers could lie down at ease, hugging each other. At the corners there were Euphorbias of Abyssinia, those thorny, counterfeit candles, full of shameful bumps, sweating poison. And, under the trees, to cover the ground, low ferns, the Adiantum, the Pterides put their delicate laces, their fine cutouts. The Alsophila, of a taller species, staged their rows of symmetrical, sexangular branches, so regular that they looked like great pieces of earthenware destined to contain the fruits of some gigantic dessert. Then, a border of Begonia and Caladium surrounded the beds; the Begonia, with twisted leaves, superbly stained with green and red; the Caladium, whose spearhead leaves, white and with green veins, look like large butterfly wings; bizarre plants whose foliage lives strangely, with a dark or fading sheen of unhealthy blooms.","A wide band of selaginella circled the pool. This dwarf fern created a thick carpet of soft green moss, a lawn of sorts. On the far side of the main circular path, four massive thickets of vegetation sent shoots soaring upward to the arched roof: the palms, leaning slightly in their grace, spread their fans, displayed their rounded crowns, and let their leafy branches droop like oars wearied by their eternal voyage through the blue of the sky; the great bamboo of India stood erect, slender and hard, letting loose a light rain of leaves from on high; a ravenala, or traveler’s tree, put up its bouquet of immense Chinese screens; and in a corner a banana tree, heavy with fruit, reached out in all directions with long horizontal leaves large enough for two lovers to lie beneath if they held each other tight. In the corners the euphorbia from Abyssinia resembled prickly candles, misshapen things whose many ugly protuberances oozed poison. Underneath the trees, providing ground cover, low ferns, the maiden-hair and strap, spread their subtle patterns of delicate lace. Plants of a taller genus, the alsophila, arrayed their branches in symmetrical tiers, hexagons of such regularity that they resembled large pieces of china, fruit bowls intended for some gigantic dessert. The clumps of trees were edged with begonia and caladium, the begonia with their twisted leaves superbly spotted with green and red, and the caladium with leaves shaped like the head of a spear, white with green veins, resembling the wings of a big butterfly—strange plants whose foliage derived an odd vitality from the splendor of poisonous blossoms both light and dark.","By way of turf, a broad edging of selaginella encircled the tank. This dwarf fern formed a thick mossy carpet of light green. Beyond the great circular path, four enormous clusters of plants shot up to the roof: palms, drooping gently in their elegance, spreading their fans, displayed their rounded crowns, hung down their leaves like oars wearied by their perpetual voyage through the blue; tall Indian bamboos rose upwards, hard, slender, dropping from on high their light shower of leaves; a ravenala, the traveller’s tree, erected its foliage like enormous Chinese screens; and in a corner a banana tree, loaded with fruit, stretched out on all sides its long horizontal leaves, on which two lovers might easily recline in each other’s arms. In the corners were Abyssinian euphorbias, deformed prickly cactuses covered with hideous excrescences, oozing with poison. Beneath the trees the ground was carpeted with creeping ferns, adianta and pterides, their fronds outlined daintily like fine lace. Alsophilas of a taller species tapered upwards with their rows of symmetrical branches, hexagonal, so regular that they looked like large pieces of porcelain made specially for the fruit of some gigantic dessert. The shrubs were surrounded by a border of begonias and caladiums: begonias with twisted leaves, gorgeously streaked with red and green; caladiums whose spear-headed leaves, white with green veins, looked like large butterfly wings; bizarre plants whose foliage lives strangely, with the sombre or wan splendour of poisonous flowers."
— Voici la verveine.,“Here is the verbena.,"Mr. Simpson, a little slow to take this in, replied that he would take verbena, whereupon M. de Saffré gave him the marquise: “Here is your verbena.”",‘Here’s your verbena.’
"Au milieu de ces intérêts, de ces soifs ardentes qui ne pouvaient se satisfaire, Renée agonisait. La tante Élisabeth était morte ; sa sœur, mariée, avait quitté l’hôtel Béraud, où son père seul restait debout, dans l’ombre grave des grandes pièces. Elle mangea en une saison l’héritage de la tante. Elle jouait, maintenant. Elle avait trouvé un salon où les dames s’attablaient jusqu’à trois heures du matin, perdant des centaines de mille francs par nuit. Elle dut essayer de boire ; mais elle ne put pas, elle avait des soulèvements de dégoût invincibles. Depuis qu’elle s’était retrouvée seule, livrée à ce flot mondain qui l’emportait, elle s’abandonnait davantage, ne sachant à quoi tuer le temps. Elle acheva de goûter à tout. Et rien ne la touchait, dans l’ennui immense qui l’écrasait. Elle vieillissait, ses yeux se cerclaient de bleu, son nez s’amincissait, la moue de ses lèvres avait des rires brusques, sans cause. C’était la fin d’une femme.","In the midst of these interests, these ardent thirsts which could not be satisfied, Renee was dying. Aunt Elisabeth was dead; his married sister had left the Hôtel Béraud, where his father alone remained standing, in the grave shade of the large rooms. She ate up her aunt's inheritance in one season. She was playing now. She had found a salon where the ladies sat down until three in the morning, losing hundreds of thousand francs a night. She had to try to drink; but she couldn't, she had invincible upheavals of disgust. Ever since she had found herself alone, given over to this worldly wave which carried her away, she had abandoned herself more, not knowing what to kill time with. She finished tasting everything. And nothing touched her, in the immense boredom that crushed her. She was growing old, her eyes were circling blue, her nose was thinning, the pouting of her lips had sudden, causeless laughter. It was the end of a woman.","While all these pecuniary interests and ardent, unquenchable thirsts swirled around her, Renée was in agony. Aunt Elisabeth had died. Her sister, now married, had left the family home, in the gloom of whose cavernous rooms her father now lived alone. In one season she ran through her aunt’s bequest. Lately she had taken to gambling. She had found a salon in which ladies sat at tables until three in the morning, losing hundreds of thousands of francs a night. Inevitably she tried to drink, but she could not: uncontrollable waves of nausea overwhelmed her. On finding herself alone again, helpless against the social tide that was sweeping her away, she had surrendered to it more than ever, not knowing any other way to kill the time. She sampled everything until nothing was left, yet none of it diminished the crushing weight of her boredom. She aged; blue circles formed around her eyes; her nose grew thinner, and her pouting lips erupted in sudden laughter for no reason. For this woman it was the end of the line.","Amid these interests, these insatiable appetites, Renée suffered agonies. Aunt Élisabeth was dead; her sister had married and left the Hôtel Béraud, where her father alone remained in the gloomy shadows of the big rooms. In one season she exhausted her aunt’s inheritance. She had taken to gambling. She had found a house where ladies sat at the card table until three o’clock in the morning, losing hundreds of thousands of francs a night. She made an attempt to drink; but she could not, overcome with disgust. Since she had found herself alone again, she let herself go more than ever, not knowing how to kill time. She tried everything. But nothing appealed to her amid the infinite boredom that engulfed her. She seemed older, she had blue rings round her eyes, her nose became thinner, her lips pouted with sudden, inexplicable laughter. She was breaking down."
"Un domestique venait de l’amener de la gare, et il était dans le grand salon, ravi par l’or de l’ameublement et du plafond, profondément heureux de ce luxe au milieu duquel il allait vivre, lorsque Renée, qui revenait de chez son tailleur, entra comme un coup de vent. Elle jeta son chapeau et le burnous blanc qu’elle avait mis sur ses épaules pour se protéger contre le froid déjà vif. Elle apparut à Maxime, stupéfait d’admiration, dans tout l’éclat de son merveilleux costume.","A servant had just brought him from the station, and he was in the large drawing-room, delighted by the gold of the furnishings and the ceiling, profoundly happy with this luxury in the midst of which he was going to live, when Renée, who was returning from at his tailor, came in like a gust of wind. She threw off her hat and the white burnous she had put on her shoulders to protect herself from the already bitter cold. She appeared to Maxime, stupefied with admiration, in all the splendor of her marvelous costume.","A servant had fetched him from the station, and he was waiting in the main drawing room, delighted by the gold on the furniture and ceiling and deeply pleased with the luxurious surroundings in which he was now to live, when Renée, returning home from her tailor’s, swept in like a gust of wind. She tossed aside her hat and the white burnoose she had wrapped around her shoulders to protect her from the already-biting cold. To Maxime, struck dumb with admiration, she seemed splendid in her marvelous costume.","A servant had just fetched him from the station, and he was waiting in the big drawing room, enraptured by the gilding on the ceiling and furniture, thoroughly delighted with this luxury in which he was about to live, when Renée, returning from her dressmaker, swept in like a gust of wind. She threw off her hat and the white burnoose she had put over her shoulders to protect her from the cold. She appeared before Maxime, who was stupefied with admiration, in all the splendour of her marvellous attire."
Elle n’acheva pas. Maxime riait avec elle. Telle fut la belle chute que fit la morale de Renée en cette aventure.,She didn't finish. Maxime laughed with her. Such was the beautiful fall which Renee's morality made in this adventure.,She did not finish her sentence. Maxime was laughing with her. Renée’s effort to turn this escapade into a lesson in morality ended then and there.,She stopped. They were both laughing hysterically. Thus concluded Renée’s lecture on this episode.
"Mais elle dit vivement qu’elle n’était pas pressée, qu’elle ne voulait pas le déranger à ce point. Lui qui venait de mettre tout son cœur dans ce dangereux « sans billet », qu’il avait laissé échapper et qu’il regrettait, ne parut pas avoir essuyé un refus désagréable. Il se releva, en disant :","But she said briskly that she was in no rush, that she didn't want to bother him that much. He who had just put his whole heart into this dangerous ""no ticket"", which he had let slip and which he regretted, did not seem to have suffered an unpleasant refusal. He got up, saying:","But she quickly interjected that she was in no rush and did not want to put him to so much trouble. Although he had just put all his heart into that dangerous phrase, “without a note to sign,” which he had allowed to escape his lips and which he now regretted, he did not seem put out by her rejection. Straightening up, he said, “Well, then, as you wish.","She interrupted him, saying that she was in no hurry, that she did not want to put him to so much trouble. Saccard, who had just put all his heart into the dangerous ‘without any promissory note’, which he had let slip and now regretted, pretended not to have received an unpleasant rebuff. He stood up, and said:"
"Cependant, au milieu du tableau, le ministre, accompagné de son secrétaire, M. de Saffré, avait paru à la porte du salon. Saccard, qui guettait impatiemment son frère, voulut se précipiter à sa rencontre. Mais celui-ci, d’un geste, le pria de ne pas bouger. Et il vint doucement jusqu’au groupe des hommes graves. Quand les rideaux se furent refermés et qu’on l’eut aperçu, un long chuchotement courut le salon, les têtes se retournèrent : le ministre balançait le succès des Amours du beau Narcisse et de la nymphe Écho.","However, in the middle of the picture, the Minister, accompanied by his secretary, M. de Saffré, had appeared at the door of the salon. Saccard, who was impatiently watching his brother, wanted to rush to meet him. But the latter, with a gesture, begged him not to move. And he came gently up to the group of serious men. When the curtains had closed and he was seen, a long whisper ran through the living room, heads turned: the minister was tossing around the success of The Loves of the Handsome Narcissus and the Nymph Echo.","Meanwhile, in the middle of the tableau, the minister, accompanied by his secretary M. de Saffré, had appeared in the door of the salon. Saccard, who had been awaiting his brother’s arrival impatiently, started to rush over to greet him. But his brother signaled him to stay where he was and walked slowly over to the group of serious men. When the curtains had closed and people noticed he was there, whispers coursed through the drawing room, and heads turned in the minister’s direction. The success of “The Amours of Handsome Narcissus and the Nymph Echo” depended on his judgment.","Meanwhile, in the middle of the tableau, the minister,* accompanied by his secretary, Monsieur de Saffré, had appeared at the door of the drawing room. Saccard, who was impatiently looking out for his brother, wanted to rush forward to welcome him. But the latter gestured for him to stay where he was. He slowly approached the group of serious-looking gentlemen. When the curtains had closed, and he was recognized, a long whisper travelled round the drawing room, all heads looked round: the minister counterbalanced the success of The Loves of Narcissus and Echo."
Puis il resta songeur.,Then he remained pensive.,"At length he said, “I’m thinking of changing my name.",Then he fell into a pensive mood:
"— C’était indécent, à table.",“It was indecent at the table.,"With some annoyance she added, “It was indecent, the way you were carrying on at the dinner table.”",‘It was indecent to go on like that at dinner.’
"Et comme elle s’arrêtait, s’essuyant les yeux, semblant chercher une transition : — Tu as quelque chose à me dire ? demanda nettement Saccard.","And as she stopped, wiping her eyes, seeming to seek a transition: ""Do you have something to tell me?"" asked Saccard sharply.","Then she stopped and, wiping her eyes, seemed to be casting about for a way to change the subject. “Do you have something to say to me?” Saccard asked bluntly.","Seeing her pause, wipe her eyes, and wait for an excuse to change the subject, Saccard asked her simply: ‘Have you got something to tell me?’"
"Sa main sèche et nerveuse coupait toujours dans le vide. Angèle avait un léger frisson, devant ce couteau vivant, ces doigts de fer qui hachaient sans pitié l’amas sans bornes des toits sombres. Depuis un instant, les brumes de l’horizon roulaient doucement des hauteurs, et elle s’imaginait entendre, sous les ténèbres qui s’amassaient dans les creux, de lointains craquements, comme si la main de son mari eût réellement fait les entailles dont il parlait, crevant Paris d’un bout à l’autre, brisant les poutres, écrasant les moellons, laissant derrière elle de longues et affreuses blessures de murs croulants. La petitesse de cette main, s’acharnant sur une proie géante, finissait par inquiéter ; et, tandis qu’elle déchirait sans effort les entrailles de l’énorme ville, on eût dit qu’elle prenait un étrange reflet d’acier, dans le crépuscule bleuâtre.","His dry, nervous hand was still cutting into the void. Angèle shivered slightly at the sight of this living knife, these iron fingers which cut without pity the boundless heap of dark roofs. For a moment the mists of the horizon had been rolling gently from the heights, and she imagined that she heard, under the darkness which gathered in the hollows, distant creaks, as if her husband's hand had really made the cuts which he spoke, bursting Paris from one end to the other, breaking the beams, crushing the rubble, leaving behind him long and dreadful wounds of crumbling walls. The smallness of this hand, bent on a giant prey, ended up worrying; and as it tore effortlessly through the entrails of the enormous city, it looked as if it took on a strange sheen of steel in the bluish twilight.","Saccard’s wizened, muscular hand continued slashing away at the void. Angèle trembled slightly at the sight of this living blade, these iron fingers pitilessly hacking at the endless expanse of dark rooftops. The haze on the horizon had just begun to roll in from the heights, and in her imagination she heard distant cracking sounds from the darkening vales below, as if her husband’s hand really were making the cuts he was describing, slicing Paris up from one end to the other, smashing beams, crushing masonry, and leaving behind long and hideous wounds where walls had collapsed. The smallness of the hand so implacably attacking its giant prey was ultimately frightening to behold, and as it effortlessly ripped the entrails of the enormous city to shreds, it seemed to take on a peculiar glint of steel in the twilight tinged with blue.","His dry, feverish hand kept cutting through the air. Angèle shivered slightly as she watched this living knife, those iron fingers mercilessly slicing up the boundless mass of dark roofs. For a moment the haze of the horizon had been descending slowly from the heights, and she fancied she could hear, beneath the gloom gathering in the hollows, distant cracking sounds, as if her husband’s hand had really made the cuts he spoke of, splitting up Paris from one end to the other, severing beams, crushing masonry, leaving behind it the long, hideous wounds of crumbling walls. The smallness of this hand, pitilessly attacking a gigantic prey, became quite disturbing; and as it effortlessly tore apart the entrails of the great city, it seemed to take on a steely glint in the blue twilight."
"Angèle se trouva parfaitement heureuse. Elle s’acheta quelques nippes, mit la broche tous les jours. Elle ne comprenait plus rien aux colères muettes de son mari, à ses mines sombres d’homme qui poursuit la solution de quelque redoutable problème.","Angèle felt perfectly happy. She bought herself a few clothes, put on the brooch every day. She no longer understood her husband's mute anger, his gloomy looks as a man who was pursuing the solution of some formidable problem.","Angèle was perfectly content. She bought herself some old clothes and put a roast on the spit daily. Her husband’s silent rages surpassed her understanding, as did the somber look he sometimes wore of a man searching for the solution to some intractable problem.","Angèle was perfectly happy. She bought herself some new clothes and ate meat every day. She could no longer understand her husband’s suppressed anger, nor the reason why he wore the sombre expression of a man trying to solve some huge problem."
"Mais le cabinet avait un coin délicieux, et ce coin-là surtout le rendait célèbre. En face de la fenêtre, les pans de la tente s’ouvraient et découvraient, au fond d’une sorte d’alcôve longue et peu profonde, une baignoire, une vasque de marbre rose, enfoncée dans le plancher, et dont les bords cannelés comme ceux d’une grande coquille arrivaient au ras du tapis. On descendait dans la baignoire par des marches de marbre. Au-dessus des robinets d’argent, au col de cygne, une glace de Venise, découpée, sans cadre, avec des dessins dépolis dans le cristal, occupait le fond de l’alcôve. Chaque matin Renée prenait un bain de quelques minutes. Ce bain emplissait pour la journée le cabinet d’une moiteur, d’une odeur de chair fraîche et mouillée. Parfois, un flacon débouché, un savon resté hors de sa boîte, mettaient une pointe plus violente dans cette langueur un peu fade. La jeune femme aimait à rester là, jusqu’à midi, presque nue. La tente ronde, elle aussi, était nue. Cette baignoire rose, ces tables et ces cuvettes roses, cette mousseline du plafond et des murs, sous laquelle on croyait voir couler un sang rose, prenaient des rondeurs de chair, des rondeurs d’épaules et de seins ; et, selon l’heure de la journée, on eût dit la peau neigeuse d’un enfant ou la peau chaude d’une femme. C’était une grande nudité. Quand Renée sortait du bain, son corps blond n’ajoutait qu’un peu de rose à toute cette chair rose de la pièce.","But the study had a delicious corner, and that corner especially made him famous. Opposite the window, the sides of the tent opened and revealed, at the bottom of a kind of long and shallow alcove, a bathtub, a pink marble basin, sunk into the floor, and whose fluted edges like those of a large shell came flush with the carpet. We descended into the bathtub by marble steps. Above the silver faucets, with swan necks, a Venetian mirror, cut out, without a frame, with frosted designs in the crystal, occupied the back of the alcove. Every morning Renée took a bath for a few minutes. This bath filled the closet for the day with a moistness, with an odor of fresh and wet flesh. Sometimes an uncorked bottle, a soap still out of its box, put a more violent edge in this somewhat bland languor. The young woman liked to stay there until noon, almost naked. The round tent, too, was bare. This pink bathtub, these tables and these pink basins, this muslin of the ceiling and the walls, under which one believed to see flowing a pink blood, took on curves of flesh, curves of shoulders and breasts; and, depending on the time of day, it looked like the snowy skin of a child or the warm skin of a woman. It was great nudity. When Renee got out of the bath, her blond body added only a little pink to all that pink flesh in the room.","The dressing room had one especially delightful corner, to which it owed its fame above all else. Opposite the window, the sections of drapery opened up to reveal, at the end of a long, shallow alcove, a bathtub, a sunken basin of pink marble set right into the floor so that its edges, fluted like those of a large shell, lay flush with the carpet. Marble steps led down into this tub. Above the swan-necked silver faucets, a scalloped Venetian mirror without a frame, with frosted patterns etched into the crystal, filled the end of the alcove. Every morning Renée took a short bath, which for the rest of the day left the dressing room suffused with moisture and a fragrance of moist young flesh. Occasionally a bottle of perfume left unstoppered or a cake of soap left out of its box injected a more violent note into this rather insipid languor, in which the young woman liked to lie almost naked until noon. The puffy draperies were also bare. The pink bathtub, tables, and basins, and the muslin covering the ceiling and walls beneath which one could imagine a reddish flow of blood, took on the roundness of flesh, of shoulders and breasts, and depending on the time of day it all resembled the snowy white skin of a child or the warm flesh of a woman. It was nakedness writ large. When Renée stepped out of her bath, her fair body added but a touch more pink to the abundant pink flesh of the room itself.","The dressing room had a delightful corner which, in particular, made it famous. In front of the window the folds of the tent parted and disclosed, in a kind of long, shallow alcove, a bath, a basin of pink marble sunk into the floor, with sides fluted like those of a large shell and rising to the level of the carpet. Marble steps led down into the bath. Above the silver taps, shaped like swans’ necks, the back of the alcove was filled with a Venetian mirror, frameless, with curved edges and a ground design on the crystal. Every morning Renée took a long bath. This filled the dressing room for the whole day with moisture, with the fragrance of fresh, wet flesh. Sometimes an unstoppered scent-bottle, or a cake of soap left out of its dish, struck a more violent note in this languorous atmosphere. Renée was fond of staying there till midday, almost naked. The round tent was naked too. The pink bath, the pink slabs and basins, the muslin of the walls and ceiling, under which pink blood seemed to course, had the curves of flesh, the curves of shoulders and breasts; and, according to the time of day, one would have imagined the snowy skin of a child or the warm skin of a woman. It was redolent of nudity. When Renée emerged from it, her fair-skinned body added a little more pink to all the pink flesh of the room."
"Et lorsqu’on lui demandait si elle avait enfin des données certaines sur ses trois milliards, elle souriait d’abord d’un air mystérieux, puis elle finissait par murmurer :","And when asked if she finally had certain data on her three billion, she first smiled mysteriously, then she ended up murmuring:","And when people asked if she had at last found out anything certain about her three billion, she smiled mysteriously at first and then murmured, “You’re all skeptics.","When she was asked if she had at last some positive information about the three thousand million, she smiled mysteriously, and muttered:"

Larsonneau continuait à trouver l’histoire un peu brutale. Il était de méthode moins dramatique ; chacune de ses opérations se nouait et se dénouait avec des élégances de comédie de salon.,Larsonneau continued to find the story a bit brutal. He was less dramatic in method; each of his operations was tied and undone with the elegance of parlor comedy.,Larsonneau still thought the story somewhat crude. He preferred less dramatic methods. Each of his operations was plotted and brought to a resolution with the elegance of a drawing-room comedy.,Larsonneau still thought the story rather clumsy. His own method was less melodramatic: each of his transactions was put together and unravelled with the elegance of a drawing room comedy.
"— Il ne peut trouver que cinquante mille francs. C’est toujours un joli acompte… Seulement, il ne veut pas mêler cette affaire avec celle de Charonne. Il n’est qu’intermédiaire, vous comprenez, chère amie ? La personne qui prête l’argent demande des intérêts énormes. Elle voudrait un billet de quatre-vingt mille francs, à six mois de date.","""He can only find fifty thousand francs."" It's always a nice deposit... Only, he doesn't want to mix up this affair with that of Charonne. He is only an intermediary, you understand, dear friend? The person who lends the money asks for huge interest.

But he doesn’t want to mix this business up with the Charonne arrangement. He’s only a go-between, you understand. Don’t you, my dear?

At least that will be useful to begin with. But he doesn’t want to mix this up with the Charonne affair. He’s only a go-between, you see.

"— Ah ! oui, la grosse Laure ! Je n’y pense guère, va. Si Aristide, comme vous voulez tous me le faire entendre, a payé les dettes de cette fille et lui a évité ainsi un voyage à l’étranger, c’est qu’il aime l’argent moins que je ne le croyais. Cela va le remettre en faveur auprès des dames… Le cher homme, je le laisse bien libre.","- Oh! yes, fat Laure! I don't think much about it, okay. If Aristide, as you all want me to understand, paid off this girl's debts and thus saved her a trip abroad, it's because he loves money less than I thought. This is going to put him back in favor with the ladies… The dear man, I leave him quite free.","Then, as if remembering, she added with her disdainful pout, “Oh, yes, of course, that fat cow Laure! As if I cared. If what everybody wants me to believe is true, and Aristide really paid that whore’s debts and spared her a trip abroad, he must be less in love with his money than I thought. That will put him back in the good graces of the ladies. . . . The dear man: I leave him perfectly free to do exactly what he wants.”","‘Ah, yes, that fat Laure! I hadn’t given her a thought, believe me. If, as everybody says, Aristide has paid that woman’s debts and saved her a trip abroad, it only proves that he’s less fond of money than I thought. This will put him back in the ladies’ good graces. The dear man can do whatever he likes.’"
"Parfois Renée, lasse de cet horizon sans bornes, grande déjà et rapportant du pensionnat des curiosités charnelles, jetait un regard dans l’école de natation des bains Petit, dont le bateau se trouve amarré à la pointe de l’île. Elle cherchait à voir, entre les linges flottants pendus à des ficelles en guise de plafond, les hommes en caleçon dont on apercevait les ventres nus.","Sometimes Renée, weary of this limitless horizon, already grown up and bringing back from the boarding school carnal curiosities, cast a glance at the Petit baths swimming school, whose boat is moored at the tip of the island. She tried to see, between the floating cloths hanging from strings as a ceiling, the men in underpants whose bare bellies could be seen.","At times, Renée, already nearly grown, weary of this limitless horizon, and bursting with curiosity acquired at school about matters of the flesh, would cast a glance in the direction of the swimming school at Petit’s floating bathhouse, moored to the tip of the island. Through the flapping linen hanging from lines that did duty for a roof, she hoped to catch a glimpse of men in bathing suits that revealed their naked torsos.","Sometimes Renée, a big girl already and full of sensual curiosity brought back from her boarding school, would throw a glance into the swimming school attached to Petit’s floating baths, which were moored to the end of the island.

"Alors ils restèrent là un instant, face à face, ne sachant que se dire. Les dents de Renée claquaient de terreur, et il lui semblait qu’on jetait des seaux d’eau glacée sur ses pieds nus. Maxime éprouvait plus d’irritation qu’il n’aurait cru ; mais il demeurait encore assez désintéressé pour réfléchir, pour se dire que l’occasion était bonne, et qu’il allait rompre.","So they stood there for a moment, face to face, not knowing what to say to each other. Renee's teeth chattered with terror, and it seemed to her that buckets of icy water were being thrown over her bare feet. Maxime was more irritated than he had expected; but he still remained sufficiently disinterested to reflect, to tell himself that the occasion was good, and that he was going to break off.","They stood there for an instant face-to-face, not knowing what to say.

Renée’s teeth chattered with terror, and it seemed to her as if buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied over her feet.

"— Je compte changer de nom, dit-il enfin, tu devrais en faire autant… Nous nous gênerions moins.","- I intend to change my name, he said finally, you should do the same ... We would be less embarrassed.",You ought to do the same. . . . We’d be less in each other’s way.”,"‘I’m thinking of changing my name,’ he said at last. ‘You should do the same.

She likes that.”","‘If I were you, I’d be very direct with her. She likes that.’"
"Ils riaient haut, sans se quitter le bras, se prêtaient main-forte au besoin dans les conversations trop vives. Le père, très fort sur ce point, débattait avantageusement les amours du fils. Parfois, ils s’asseyaient, buvaient avec une bande de filles. Puis ils changeaient de table, ils reprenaient leurs courses.

Then they might move to another table or continue their stroll. Until midnight they could always be seen, arms linked like a couple of schoolfellows, chasing skirts down the yellow walkways under the harsh flame of the gaslights.","They laughed out loud, without unlocking their arms, and came to one another’s aid if necessary whenever the conversation became too lively.

Until midnight they were seen, arm in arm, following the petticoats along the yellow pathways, under the bright flames of the gas jets."
"En haut, le cabinet de toilette était en plein désordre. Sur les sièges traînaient le costume de la nymphe Écho, le maillot déchiré, des bouts de dentelle froissés, des linges jetés en paquet, tout ce que la hâte d’une femme attendue laisse derrière elle. Les petits outils d’ivoire et d’argent gisaient un peu partout ; il y avait des brosses, des limes tombées sur le tapis ; et les serviettes encore humides, les savons oubliés sur le marbre, les flacons laissés débouchés, mettaient, dans la tente couleur de chair, une odeur forte, pénétrante. La jeune femme, pour enlever le blanc de ses bras et de ses épaules, s’était trempée dans la baignoire de marbre rose, après les tableaux vivants. Des plaques irisées s’arrondissaient sur la nappe d’eau refroidie.","Upstairs, the bathroom was a mess. On the seats lay the costume of the nymph Echo, the torn jersey, bits of crumpled lace, linens thrown in bundles, everything that the haste of an expected woman leaves behind. Small ivory and silver tools were lying everywhere; there were brushes, files that had fallen on the carpet; and the towels still damp, the soaps forgotten on the marble, the bottles left uncorked, gave the flesh-colored tent a strong, penetrating odor. The young woman, to remove the white from her arms and shoulders, had soaked herself in the pink marble bathtub, after the tableaux vivants. Iridescent plates rounded on the sheet of cooled water.","Upstairs, the dressing room was in total disarray. Tossed aside and left lying on the chairs were the nymph Echo’s costume, the torn tights, bits of crumpled lace, and balled-up underthings— the kinds of things a woman urgently expected elsewhere leaves behind in her haste.

Brushes and files had fallen onto the carpet; and the still-damp towels, the cakes of soap forgotten on the marble, the perfume bottles left unstoppered filled the flesh-colored tent with a strong, penetrating odor.

An iridescent film of soap spread in patches over the surface of the bathwater now grown cold.","Upstairs, the dressing room was in complete disorder.

"Laure d’Aurigny s’était procuré des feuilles de papier timbré dans la journée. Mais quand il fut question d’une plume et d’un encrier, elle regarda les deux hommes d’un air consterné, doutant de trouver chez elle ces objets. Elle voulait aller voir à la cuisine, lorsque Larsonneau tira de sa poche, de la poche où était le drageoir, deux merveilles, un porte-plume en argent, qui s’allongeait à l’aide d’une vis, et un encrier, acier et ébène, d’un fini et d’une délicatesse de bijou.

But when it came to a quill and an inkwell, she looked at the two men in dismay, doubting whether she would find these items at home. She wanted to go to the kitchen, when Larsonneau took from his pocket, from the pocket where the bezel was, two marvels, a silver pen holder, which was extended by a screw, and an inkwell, steel and ebony, with the finish and delicacy of a jewel. And as Rozan sat down:","Laure d’Aurigny had obtained some official stamped paper earlier in the day. But when the moment came to find pen and ink, she looked at the two men with a perplexed expression, uncertain whether she had any in the house.

Rozan sat down to write.","Laure d’Aurigny had managed to find some bill-stamps during the day. But when it became a question of pen and ink, she looked at the two men in consternation, doubting whether she had such things in the house. She proposed to go and look in the kitchen, when Larsonneau took from his pocket—the same pocket that held the bag of sweets—two marvellous objects: a silver penholder that screwed out, and an inkstand in steel and ebony, finished as delicately as a trinket. As Rozan sat down, he said:"
"Celle-ci, après avoir rapproché son frère de la tante Élisabeth, s’était prudemment effacée. Elle n’était pas même venue au mariage. Il se montra très rond avec le vieillard, ayant lu dans son regard une surprise à voir le séducteur de sa fille petit, laid, âgé de quarante ans. Les nouveaux mariés furent obligés de passer les premières nuits à l’hôtel Béraud. On avait, depuis deux mois, éloigné Christine, pour que cette enfant de quatorze ans ne soupçonnât rien du drame qui se passait dans cette maison calme et douce comme un cloître. Lorsqu’elle revint, elle resta tout interdite devant le mari de sa sœur, qu’elle trouva, elle aussi, vieux et laid. Renée seule ne paraissait pas trop s’apercevoir de l’âge ni de la figure chafouine de son mari. Elle le traitait sans mépris comme sans tendresse, avec une tranquillité absolue, où perçait seulement parfois une pointe d’ironique dédain. Saccard se carrait, se mettait chez lui, et réellement, par sa verve, par sa rondeur, il gagnait peu à peu l’amitié de tout le monde. Quand ils partirent, pour aller occuper un superbe appartement, dans une maison neuve de la rue de Rivoli, le regard de M. Béraud du Châtel n’avait déjà plus d’étonnement, et la petite Christine jouait avec son beau-frère comme avec un camarade. Renée était alors enceinte de quatre mois ; son mari allait l’envoyer à la campagne, comptant mentir ensuite sur l’âge de l’enfant, lorsque, selon les prévisions de Mme Sidonie, elle fit une fausse couche. Elle s’était tellement serrée pour dissimuler sa grossesse, qui, d’ailleurs, disparaissait sous l’ampleur de ses jupes, qu’elle fut obligée de garder le lit pendant quelques semaines. Il fut ravi de l’aventure ; la fortune lui était enfin fidèle : il avait fait un marché d’or, une dot superbe, une femme belle à le faire décorer en six mois, et pas la moindre charge. On lui avait acheté deux cent mille francs son nom pour un fœtus que la mère ne voulut pas même voir. Dès lors, il songea avec amour aux terrains de Charonne. Mais, pour le moment, il accordait tous ses soins à une spéculation qui devait être la base de sa fortune.","The latter, after bringing her brother closer to Aunt Elisabeth, had prudently withdrawn. She hadn't even come to the wedding. He showed himself to be very round with the old man, having read surprise in his eyes at seeing his daughter's seducer, small, ugly, forty years old. The newlyweds were obliged to spend the first nights at the Hôtel Béraud. They had, for two months, sent Christine away, so that this fourteen-year-old child should suspect nothing of the drama that was going on in this house, calm and gentle as a cloister. When she returned, she was dumbfounded by her sister's husband, whom she also found old and ugly. Renée alone did not seem to notice too much her husband's age or sly face. She treated him without contempt as without tenderness, with absolute tranquility, in which only occasionally pierced a hint of ironic disdain. Saccard straightened up, sat down at home, and really, by his liveliness, by his plumpness, he gradually won the friendship of everyone. When they left to go and occupy a superb apartment in a new house in the rue de Rivoli, M. Béraud du Châtel's eyes were already clear of astonishment, and little Christine was playing with her brother-in-law as with a classmate. Renée was then four months pregnant; her husband was about to send her to the country, counting afterwards on lying about the age of the child, when, according to Madame Sidonie's predictions, she had a miscarriage. She had squeezed herself so tight to conceal her pregnancy, which, moreover, disappeared under the fullness of her skirts, that she was obliged to stay in bed for a few weeks. He was delighted with the adventure; Fortune was finally faithful to him: he had made a gold bargain, a superb dowry, a beautiful woman to have him decorated in six months, and not the slightest charge. They had bought her two hundred thousand francs for her name for a fetus that the mother did not even want to see. From then on, he thought with love of the grounds of Charonne. But, for the moment, he gave all his attention to a speculation which was to be the basis of his fortune.","After putting the clerk in touch with Aunt Elisabeth, his sister had prudently stepped aside. She had not even come to the wedding. He took a very straightforward line with the old man, having read in his eyes a look of surprise at discovering that his daughter had been seduced by a man who was short, ugly, and forty years old. The newlyweds were obliged to spend their first nights together in the Hôtel Béraud. Christine, a child of fourteen, had been sent away two months earlier in order to make sure that she would not get wind of the drama unfolding in the house, as calm and serene as a convent. When she returned, she was aghast at the sight of her sister’s husband, whom she also found old and ugly. Only Renée seemed to take relatively little notice of her husband’s age or the slyness of his countenance. She showed him neither contempt nor affection and dealt with him in absolute tranquillity, through which a hint of ironic disdain manifested itself from time to time. Saccard settled in, made himself at home, and with his verve and frankness gradually won the genuine friendship of everyone involved. By the time the couple left to take up residence in a superb apartment in a new house on the rue de Rivoli, there was no longer any amazement in M. Béraud Du Châtel’s gaze, and little Christine had made a playmate of her brother-in-law. Renée was then four months pregnant. Her husband was about to send her to the country in order to be able to lie about the child’s age later on when, as Mme Sidonie had predicted, she miscarried. She had laced herself up so tightly to hide her condition, which in any case was concealed by the fullness of her skirts, that she was obliged to take to her bed for several weeks. Saccard was delighted by the outcome. Fortune had kept faith with him. He had made a fabulous bargain: a superb dowry, a wife beautiful enough to earn him a decoration six months hence, and no obligations whatsoever. They had paid him 200,000 francs for his name on behalf of a fetus the mother did not even wish to see. Already the Charonne properties had become the object of his fondest dreams, but for the time being he devoted all his attention to a speculative venture that was to become the basis of his fortune.","The latter, after bringing her brother and Aunt Élisabeth together, had prudently disappeared. She had not even come to the wedding. Saccard decided to be very direct with the old man, having read in his face a look of surprise at finding his daughter’s seducer ugly, short, and forty years old. The newly married couple were compelled to spend their first nights at the Hôtel Béraud. Christine had been sent away two months earlier, so that this child of fourteen would know nothing of the drama that was taking place in the house, which remained as quiet as a convent. When she returned home she stood in mute horror before her sister’s husband, whom she too thought old and ugly. Renée alone seemed untroubled by her husband’s age or his sly look. She treated him neither with contempt nor affection, but very calmly, with an occasional glimmer of ironical disdain. Saccard strutted about, made himself at home, and really succeeded by his directness and energy in gradually winning everybody over. When they left, to install themselves in an imposing apartment in a new house in the Rue de Rivoli, * Monsieur Béraud du Châtel had lost his look of surprise and Christine had taken to playing with her brother-in-law as with a schoolfriend. Renée was now four months pregnant; her husband was on the point of sending her to the country, proposing afterwards to lie about the child’s age, when, as Madame Sidonie had foretold, she had a miscarriage. She had laced herself so tightly to hide her condition, which was in any case concealed under the fullness of her skirts, that she had to keep to her bed for several weeks. He was delighted with the way things had turned out. Fortune was at last on his side; he had made a golden bargain: a splendid dowry, a wife whose beauty would be worth a decoration to him within six months, and not the least responsibility. He had received two hundred thousand francs to give his name to a foetus which its mother would not even look at. From that moment his thoughts began to turn affectionately towards the Charonne property. But for the time being he devoted all his attention to a speculative venture which was to be the basis of his fortune."
"L’empereur et le vieux général continuaient à avancer à petits pas, paraissant se soutenir, alanguis, vaguement souriants. Ils regardaient les dames inclinées, et leurs coups d’œil, jetés à droite et à gauche, glissaient dans les corsages. Le général se penchait, disait un mot au maître, lui serrait le bras d’un air de joyeux compagnon. Et l’empereur, mou et voilé, plus terne encore que de coutume, approchait toujours de sa marche traînante.","The Emperor and the old general continued to advance with small steps, seeming to support each other, languid, vaguely smiling. They looked at the bowing ladies, and their glances, cast to right and left, slipped into the bodices. The general leaned over, said a word to the master, squeezed his arm with the air of a joyful companion. And the Emperor, limp and veiled, even duller than usual, was still approaching his shuffle.","Appearing to support each other, the Emperor and the elderly general continued to move forward in a lethargic manner, taking short steps and smiling vaguely. They looked to the right and to the left, and as they did their gazes slipped into the bodices of the bowing ladies.

And the Emperor, listless and impenetrable, even more vapid than usual, drew nearer and nearer in his dawdling way.","Looking weary, vaguely smiling, the Emperor and the old General advanced with short steps, seeming to hold each other up. They looked at the bowing ladies, and their glances, cast to right and left, glided into the bodices. The General leant on one side, said something to his master, and squeezed his arm with the air of an old friend. The Emperor, lethargic and inscrutable, even more lifeless than usual, came closer and closer with his shuffling step."
"— Dites, elle ne nous en avait jamais autant montré, dit plaisamment Louise à l’oreille de Maxime, en lui désignant Renée du coin de l’œil.","""Hey, she's never shown us so much,"" Louise said pleasantly in Maxime's ear, pointing to Renée out of the corner of her eye.","“You know, she’s never shown us that much before,” Louise teasingly whispered in Maxime’s ear, indicating Renée with a quick glance.","‘I say, she has never showed us as much as that before,’ said Louise playfully in Maxime’s ear."
"Mais on ne l’écoutait pas. La salle à manger était pleine, et des habits noirs inquiets se haussaient à la porte. Devant les dressoirs, des groupes stationnaient, mangeant vite, se serrant.

The dining-room was full, and worried black coats stood at the door. In front of the dressers, groups were stationed, eating quickly, huddled together.

Il en est encore à la salade de homard.","- Oh ! you would have eaten badly, he replied, laughing. Saffré does not have the slightest culinary imagination. It's still lobster salad.","“Oh, you wouldn’t have eaten very well,” he replied, laughing. “Saffré hasn’t the slightest culinary imagination.

"c’est toi, disait celui-ci d’un ton réjoui. Entre donc. Vous faites un tapage à ne pas s’entendre manger. Avec qui donc êtes-vous là ?","it's you, said the latter in a joyful tone. Come in. You make a fuss not to hear yourself eat. Who are you here with?","his father would rejoin in a jocular tone of voice. “Come in, why don’t you? You’re making so much noise I can’t hear myself eat. So who are you with tonight?”","It’s you,’ said the latter jovially. ‘Come in. You’re making so much noise that a man can’t hear himself eat. Who are you with?’"

"Maxime lui répondit sur le même ton, et les jeunes gens retrouvèrent leurs grands éclats de rire du dîner. Assis à ses pieds, sur un siège très bas, il finit par lui prendre les mains, par jouer avec elle, comme avec un camarade. Et, en vérité, dans sa robe de foulard blanc à pois rouges, avec son corsage montant, sa poitrine plate, sa petite tête laide et futée de gamin, elle ressemblait à un garçon déguisé en fille. Mais, par instants, ses bras grêles, sa taille déviée, avaient des poses abandonnées, et des ardeurs passaient au fond de ses yeux pleins encore de puérilité, sans qu’elle rougît le moins du monde des jeux de Maxime. Et tous deux de rire, se croyant seuls, sans même apercevoir Renée, debout au milieu de la serre, à demi cachée, qui les regardait de loin.","Maxime answered him in the same tone, and the young people resumed their bursts of laughter from dinner. Sitting at her feet, on a very low seat, he ends up taking her hands, playing with her, as with a comrade. And, in truth, in her dress of white kerchief with red polka dots, with her high bodice, her flat chest, her ugly and clever little boyish head, she looked like a boy disguised as a girl. But, at times, her slender arms, her crooked figure, had abandoned poses, and ardor passed through the depths of her eyes, still full of childishness, without her blushing in the least at Maxime's games. And they both laughed, thinking they were alone, without even noticing Renée, standing in the middle of the greenhouse, half hidden, watching them from afar.","Maxime responded in kind, and the two young people were soon laughing again as loudly as they had done at dinner. Maxime sat on a very low stool at Louise’s feet, and by and by he took her hands and carried on with her as he would have done with a comrade. In her dress of white foulard with red polka dots and a high bodice, and with her flat chest, small ugly head, and cunning baby face, she looked like a boy disguised as a girl. Yet at times her slender arms and misshapen body assumed some rather provocative poses, ardor flickered in her still childlike eyes, and Maxime’s teasing failed to bring the slightest blush to her face. Both laughed in the belief that they were alone, unaware that Renée, standing half-hidden in the conservatory, was observing them from a distance.","Maxime replied in similar vein, and the two young people began laughing loudly again as at dinner. Sitting on a very low stool at her feet, he ended by taking her hands and playing with her as with a schoolfriend. In fact, in her frock of white foulard with red dots, with her high-cut bodice, her flat chest, and her ugly, cunning little urchin’s face, she might have passed for a boy dressed as a girl. Yet at times her puny arms, her distorted form, would assume a pose of abandonment, and her eyes, still quite innocent, would sparkle; but not the slightest blush was brought to her cheek by Maxime’s playfulness. They laughed again, thinking themselves alone, not seeing Renée, who stood half hidden in the middle of the hothouse, watching them from a distance."
"— Oh ! les gants ont du bon, cher maître : on touche à tout sans se salir.","- Oh ! gloves are good, dear master: you can touch everything without getting dirty.","“Thanks for the instruction, but gloves have their uses: you can touch all sorts of things without getting your hands dirty.”","‘Oh, gloves have their advantages: you can touch anything without getting dirty.’"

"La ville n’était plus qu’une grande débauche de millions et de femmes. Le vice, venu de haut, coulait dans les ruisseaux, s’étalait dans les bassins, remontait dans les jets d’eau des jardins, pour retomber sur les toits, en pluie fine et pénétrante. Et il semblait, la nuit, lorsqu’on passait les ponts, que la Seine charriât, au milieu de la ville endormie, les ordures de la cité, miettes tombées de la table, nœuds de dentelle laissés sur les divans, chevelures oubliées dans les fiacres, billets de banque glissés des corsages, tout ce que la brutalité du désir et le contentement immédiat de l’instinct jettent à la rue, après l’avoir brisé et souillé. Alors, dans le sommeil fiévreux de Paris, et mieux encore que dans sa quête haletante du grand jour, on sentait le détraquement cérébral, le cauchemar doré et voluptueux d’une ville folle de son or et de sa chair. Jusqu’à minuit les violons chantaient ; puis les fenêtres s’éteignaient, et les ombres descendaient sur la ville. C’était comme une alcôve colossale où l’on aurait soufflé la dernière bougie, éteint la dernière pudeur. Il n’y avait plus, au fond des ténèbres, qu’un grand râle d’amour furieux et las ; tandis que les Tuileries, au bord de l’eau, allongeaient leurs bras dans le noir, comme pour une embrassade énorme.","The city was nothing more than a great debauchery of millions and women. Vice, coming from above, flowed in the streams, spread out in the basins, rose in the fountains of the gardens, to fall back on the roofs, in a fine and penetrating rain. And it seemed, at night, when you crossed the bridges, that the Seine carried along, in the middle of the sleeping city, the refuse of the city, crumbs that had fallen from the table, knots of lace left on the divans, hair forgotten in the cabs, banknotes slipped from bodices, everything that the brutality of desire and the immediate satisfaction of instinct throw into the street, after having smashed and defiled it. Then, in the feverish sleep of Paris, and even better than in its panting quest for the big day, one felt the cerebral derangement, the golden and voluptuous nightmare of a city mad about its gold and its flesh. Until midnight the violins sang; then the windows were darkened, and shadows fell over the city. It was like a colossal alcove where one would have blown out the last candle, extinguished the last modesty. There was nothing more, in the depths of the darkness, than a great rattle of furious and weary love; while the Tuileries, at the edge of the water, stretched out their arms in the dark, as if for an enormous embrace.","The city had become an orgy of millions and of women.

"S’ils avaient fermé les yeux, si la chaleur suffocante et la lumière pâle n’avaient pas mis en eux une dépravation de tous les sens, les odeurs eussent suffi à les jeter dans un éréthisme nerveux extraordinaire.

From time to time La Vanille sang with the cooing of a wood-pigeon; then came the harsh notes of the Stanhopéa[35] , whose tiger-striped mouths have the strong, bitter breath of a convalescent. The Orchids, in their baskets held in place by chains, exhaled their breaths, like living censers. But the odor that dominated, the odor in which all these vague sighs melted, was a human odor, an odor of love, which Maxime recognized when he kissed Renée's neck, when he buried his head in the of her loose hair. And they remained intoxicated with the smell of a woman in love, which lingered in the greenhouse, as in an alcove where the earth gave birth.","Had they closed their eyes, had the suffocating heat and pale light not been enough to plunge them into depravity of all the senses, the odors would have sufficed to rouse their nerves to an extraordinary degree of irritability. The pool enveloped them in a deep, pungent aroma compounded of the smells of a thousand blossoms and leaves. At times the vanilla cooed like wood pigeons. Then the stanhopea chimed in with harsh notes from their striped throats, whose exhalations were marked by a strong and bitter smell of convalescence. The orchids, in baskets suspended from small chains, were like living censers breathing out their distinctive scents. But the dominant odor, the odor responsible for all the muffled sighs, was a human odor, an odor of love, which Maxime recognized when he kissed the back of Renée’s neck and buried his head in her undone tresses. They were still intoxicated by that odor of amorous womanhood, which hung about the air of the conservatory as though this were the alcove where the earth gave birth.","If they had closed their eyes, if the stifling heat and pale light had not distorted their senses, the scents would have been enough to throw them into an extraordinary state of excitement. The pond saturated them with a deep, pungent odour, through which passed the thousand perfumes of the flowers and plants. At times the vanilla plant sang with dove-like cooings; then came the rough notes of the stanhopeas, whose striped throats have the putrid breath of convalescent invalids. The orchids, in baskets suspended by wire chains, emitted their exhalations like living censers. But the dominant scent, in which all these vague breaths were intermingled, was a human scent, a scent of love, which Maxime recognized when he kissed Renée on the neck and plunged his head into her flowing hair. They lay intoxicated with this scent of an amorous woman, which trailed through the hothouse as through an alcove in which the earth itself was giving birth."
"Il se tut de nouveau, les yeux fixés ardemment sur la ville, où les ombres roulaient de plus en plus épaisses. Il devait interroger cet avenir trop éloigné qui lui échappait. Puis, la nuit se fit, la ville devint confuse, on l’entendit respirer largement, comme une mer dont on ne voit plus que la crête pâle des vagues. Çà et là, quelques murs blanchissaient encore ; et, une à une, les flammes jaunes des becs de gaz piquèrent les ténèbres, pareilles à des étoiles s’allumant dans le noir d’un ciel d’orage.","He fell silent again, his eyes fixed ardently on the city, where the shadows rolled thicker and thicker. He had to question this too distant future which escaped him. Then, night fell, the city became confused, we heard it breathing deeply, like a sea of which we can only see the pale crest of the waves. Here and there a few walls were still white; and, one by one, the yellow flames of the gaslights stung the darkness, like stars lighting up in the blackness of a stormy sky.","He lapsed again into silence, his eyes fixed ardently on the city, which darkness gathered in its folds. He must have been pondering that future so remote that even he could not yet grasp it. Then night fell, and the city dissolved into a blur and seemed to breathe heavily, like the sea when nothing can be seen but the pale crests of the waves. Here and there, the whiteness of a wall still stood out, and one by one the yellow flames of the gaslights pierced the shadows, like stars making their appearance in the blackness of a stormy night.","He fell silent again, his eyes fixed on the city, over which the shadows were darkening. He must have been trying to imagine the future. Then night fell, the city became indistinct, and it could be heard breathing heavily, like the sea when the eye can only make out the pale crests of the waves. Here and there the white patch of a wall could still be made out; and the yellow flames of the gas jets pierced the darkness one by one, like stars lighting up in the blackness of a stormy sky."
"Il allait frapper à la porte du cabinet, curieux de voir la conquête de son père.","He was going to knock on the door of the study, curious to see his father's conquest.","he would shout, with an expression on his face borrowed from one of the popular actors of the day.","He went and knocked at the door of the private room, curious to see his father’s conquest."
"Un nouveau silence se fit. Mme Sidonie ne pleurnichait plus ; elle était en affaire, sa voix prenait les notes métalliques d’une revendeuse qui discute un marché. Son frère, la regardant en dessous, ajouta avec quelque hésitation :","Another silence fell. Madame Sidonie no longer whined; she was in business, her voice took on the metallic notes of a saleswoman discussing a deal. Her brother, looking down at her, added with some hesitation:","Another silence ensued. Mme Sidonie had stopped weeping. She was doing business now, and her voice took on the metallic sound of a secondhand dealer haggling over a sale. Her brother looked at her with a sidelong glance and, after a moment’s hesitation, added, “","They fell silent again. Madame Sidonie had stopped snivelling; she was doing business now, her voice assumed the metallic tones of a second-hand clothes-seller haggling over a bargain.

"Ces dernières paroles glacèrent les hommes graves. La conversation tomba net, et chacun parut éviter de regarder son voisin. La phrase du maçon atteignait ces messieurs, roide comme le pavé de l’ours. Michelin, qui justement contemplait Saccard d’un air agréable, cessa de sourire, très effrayé d’avoir eu l’air un instant d’appliquer les paroles de l’entrepreneur au maître de la maison. Ce dernier lança un coup d’œil à Mme Sidonie, qui accapara de nouveau Mignon, en disant : « Vous aimez donc le rose, monsieur ?… » Puis Saccard fit un long compliment à Mme d’Espanet ; sa figure noirâtre, chafouine, touchait presque les épaules laiteuses de la jeune femme, qui se renversait avec de petits rires.","These last words froze the grave men. The conversation fell off sharply, and everyone seemed to avoid looking at their neighbor. The mason's sentence reached these gentlemen, stiff as the pavement of the bear. Michelin, who was just contemplating Saccard with a pleasant air, ceased to smile, very frightened at having seemed for a moment to apply the contractor's words to the master of the house. The latter glanced at Madame Sidonie, who once again engrossed Mignon, saying: ""Do you like pink, sir, then?..."" Then Saccard paid a long compliment to Madame d'Espanet; his blackish, sly face almost touched the milky shoulders of the young woman, who leaned back with little laughs.","These last words cast an icy chill over the grave men at the center of the table. The conversation came to an abrupt halt, and neighbor avoided looking at neighbor. It was as though the former bricklayer, in trying to pay these very serious gentlemen a compliment, had dropped a ton of bricks on them. Michelin, who had as a matter of fact been contemplating Saccard in a most pleasant manner, stopped smiling, terrified at the thought that he might have seemed for a moment to take the contractor’s words as applying to their host. Saccard himself glanced at Mme Sidonie, who again turned her full attention to Mignon: “So you like pink, do you?” He then complimented Mme d’Espanet at length. The young woman’s dark, sly face almost touched her milky white shoulders, which she threw back slightly as she laughed.","These last words seemed to freeze the serious-looking men. The conversation stopped, and everyone tried to avoid his neighbour’s eyes. The bricklayer’s aphorism struck home, deadly as the paving-stone of La Fontaine’s bear. * Michelin, who was beaming at Saccard, stopped smiling, anxious not to seem to have applied the contractor’s words to the master of the house. The latter cast a glance at Madame Sidonie, who was tackling Mignon once more, saying: ‘So you like pink, Monsieur?’ At the same time, Saccard paid an elaborate compliment to Madame d’Espanet; his swarthy, foxy face almost touched her milky shoulders as she threw herself back and tittered."
"Ce ton railleur la blessait. Alors elle renchérit encore sur ses éloges, elle trouva son mari tout à fait grand, elle parla de l’affaire de Charonne, de ce tripotage où elle n’avait rien compris, comme d’une catastrophe dans laquelle s’étaient révélées à elle l’intelligence et la bonté de Saccard. Elle ajouta qu’elle signerait l’acte de cession le lendemain, et que si c’était réellement là un désastre, elle acceptait ce désastre en punition de ses fautes. Maxime la laissait aller, ricanant, la regardant en dessous ; puis il dit à demi-voix :","This mocking tone hurt her. Then she went even further on her praises, she found her husband quite great, she spoke of the Charonne affair, of this fiddling in which she had understood nothing, as of a catastrophe in which they had revealed themselves to her. Saccard's intelligence and kindness. She added that she would sign the deed of surrender the next day, and that if this was really a disaster, she accepted this disaster as punishment for her faults. Maxime let her go, sneering, looking down at her; then he said in a low voice:","His mocking tone wounded her. So she praised her husband all the more, said that he was a great man, and discussed the Charonne business—all those shady maneuvers of which she had understood nothing—as if Saccard had rescued her from some catastrophe, thereby revealing his intelligence and kindness. She added that she would be signing the purchase-and-sale agreement the next day and that if it really did end in disaster, she would accept that disaster as punishment for her sins. Maxime let her talk, snickering and stealing glances at her as she spoke.","This bantering tone offended her. She increased her praises, she talked of the Charonne affair, of the swindle of which she had understood nothing, as if it had been a catastrophe in which Saccard’s intelligence and kind-heartedness had been revealed to her.

Maxime let her go on, chuckling, looking at her furtively; then he said in an undertone:"
"Le chemin où ces messieurs s’engagèrent était affreux. Il avait plu toute la nuit. Le sol détrempé devenait un fleuve de boue, entre les maisons écroulées, sur cette route tracée en pleines terres molles, où les tombereaux de transport entraient jusqu’aux moyeux. Aux deux côtés, des pans de murs, crevés par la pioche, restaient debout ; de hautes bâtisses éventrées, montrant leurs entrailles blafardes, ouvraient en l’air leurs cages d’escalier vides, leurs chambres béantes, suspendues, pareilles aux tiroirs brisés de quelque grand vilain meuble. Rien n’était plus lamentable que les papiers peints de ces chambres, des carrés jaunes ou bleus qui s’en allaient en lambeaux, indiquant, à une hauteur de cinq et six étages, jusque sous les toits, de pauvres petits cabinets, des trous étroits, où toute une existence d’homme avait peut-être tenu. Sur les murailles dénudées, les rubans des cheminées montaient côte à côte, avec des coudes brusques, d’un noir lugubre. Une girouette oubliée grinçait au bord d’une toiture, tandis que des gouttières à demi détachées pendaient, pareilles à des guenilles. Et la trouée s’enfonçait toujours, au milieu de ces ruines, pareille à une brèche que le canon aurait ouverte ; la chaussée, encore à peine indiquée, emplie de décombres, avait des bosses de terre, des flaques d’eau profondes, s’allongeait sous le ciel gris, dans la pâleur sinistre de la poussière de plâtre qui tombait, et comme bordée de filets de deuil par les rubans noirs des cheminées.","The path these gentlemen took was dreadful. It had rained all night. The sodden ground became a river of mud, between the collapsed houses, on this road traced in open soft ground, where the dump trucks entered up to the hubs. On both sides, sections of wall, punctured by the pickaxe, remained standing; tall, gutted buildings, showing their pallid entrails, opened up their empty stairwells, their gaping, suspended rooms, like the broken drawers of some big ugly piece of furniture. Nothing was more lamentable than the wall-papers of these rooms, yellow or blue squares which were falling off, indicating, at a height of five or six floors, even under the roofs, poor little closets, holes narrow, where a whole existence of man had perhaps held. On the bare walls, the ribbons of the chimneys rose side by side, with sudden bends, of a lugubrious black. A forgotten weather vane creaked on the edge of a roof, while half-detached gutters hung like rags. And the gap continued to sink through the middle of these ruins, like a breach opened by cannon; the roadway, still barely marked, filled with rubble, had bumps of earth, deep puddles, stretched out under the gray sky, in the sinister pallor of the falling plaster dust, and as if lined with nets of mourning by the black ribbons of the chimneys.","The path these gentlemen set out to follow was in terrible condition. It had rained all night. The soggy ground had turned into a river of mud between crumbling buildings, following a line marked out on earth so soft that carts hauling rubble sank in up to their axles. On either side stood sections of wall shattered by pickaxes. Tall buildings had been gutted so that their blanched entrails showed: empty stair-wells and gaping rooms hung in the air like the smashed drawers of some huge, ugly bureau. No sight could be sadder than the wallpaper in the bedrooms five or six stories up, yellow or blue squares now in tatters marking the places under the roofs where poor, wretched garrets had been—tiny holes that had once housed someone’s entire existence. Ribbons of flue pipe, depressingly black in color and with sharp elbows, climbed bare walls side by side. A forgotten weathervane made a grating sound as it rotated close to the edge of one roof, while half-detached gutters hung down like rags. And the chasm continued on into the ruins like a breach opened by cannon fire. The path of the roadway, still hard to make out, was filled with debris and marked by mounds of earth and deep puddles; on it went beneath gray skies, enveloped in a sinister cloud of falling plaster dust and lined by black ribbons of flue pipe, which were like the badges worn by mourners.","The path these gentlemen followed was dreadful. It had been raining all night.

"Puis, au bout d’un nouveau silence :","Then, after another silence:","Then, after another interval of silence: “She was wearing a very pretty bracelet, the one on her left wrist.","Then, after a fresh pause:"

"Mais à mesure qu’elle agrandissait son projet, la terreur reprenait Maxime. Quitter Paris, aller si loin avec une femme qui était folle assurément, laisser derrière lui une histoire dont le côté honteux l’exilait à jamais ! c’était comme un cauchemar atroce qui l’étouffait. Il cherchait avec désespoir un moyen pour sortir de ce cabinet de toilette, de ce réduit rose où battait le glas de Charenton.

He thought he found it.","But as her plans for the future grew more grandiose by the minute, terror again took hold of Maxime. To leave Paris, to go so far with a woman who was assuredly mad, and to leave in his wake a scandal so shameful that he would be obliged to remain in exile forever—it was like a horrible nightmare snuffing the life out of him. He desperately sought a way out of that dressing room, that pink fortress in which he could hear the tolling of the madhouse bell at Charenton.9 Then he thought he saw a ray of hope.","But hearing her elaborating her plan, Maxime was again seized with terror. To leave Paris, to go so far away with a woman who was undoubtedly mad, to leave behind a scandal that would exile him forever! It was as if he were being suffocated by a hideous nightmare.

"En effet, presque tous les convives étaient arrivés. Il y avait en bas sa sœur Christine, une jeune fille de vingt ans, très simplement mise en mousseline blanche ; sa tante Élisabeth, la veuve du notaire Aubertot, en satin noir, petite vieille de soixante ans, d’une amabilité exquise ; la sœur de son mari, Sidonie Rougon, femme maigre, doucereuse, sans âge certain, au visage de cire molle, et que sa robe de couleur éteinte effaçait encore davantage ; puis les Mareuil, le père, M. de Mareuil, qui venait de quitter le deuil de sa femme, un grand bel homme, vide, sérieux, ayant une ressemblance frappante avec le valet de chambre Baptiste, et la fille, cette pauvre Louise, comme on la nommait, une enfant de dix-sept ans, chétive, légèrement bossue, qui portait avec une grâce maladive une robe de foulard blanc, à pois rouges ; puis tout un groupe d’hommes graves, gens très décorés, messieurs officiels à têtes blêmes et muettes, et, plus loin, un autre groupe, des jeunes hommes, l’air vicieux, le gilet largement ouvert, entourant cinq ou six dames de haute élégance, parmi lesquelles trônaient les inséparables, la petite marquise d’Espanet, en jaune, et la blonde Mme Haffner, en violet. M. de Mussy, ce cavalier au salut duquel Renée n’avait pas répondu, était là également, avec la mine inquiète d’un amant qui sent venir son congé. Et, au milieu des longues traînes étalées sur le tapis, deux entrepreneurs, deux maçons enrichis, les Mignon et Charrier, avec lesquels Saccard devait terminer une affaire le lendemain, promenaient lourdement leurs fortes bottes, les mains derrière le dos, crevant dans leur habit noir.","Indeed, almost all the guests had arrived. Downstairs was her sister Christine, a young girl of twenty, very simply dressed in white muslin; his aunt Elisabeth, the widow of the notary Aubertot, in black satin, a little old woman of sixty, exquisitely amiable; her husband's sister, Sidonie Rougon, a lean, sweet woman, ageless, with a face of soft wax, whose faded colored dress effaced even more; then the Mareuils, the father, M. de Mareuil, who had just left the mourning of his wife, a tall handsome man, empty, serious, bearing a striking resemblance to the valet de chambre Baptiste, and the daughter, that poor Louise, as she was called, a child of seventeen, puny, slightly humpbacked, who wore with sickly grace a dress of white scarf with red dots; then a whole group of grave men, very decorated people, official gentlemen with pale and dumb heads, and, further on, another group, young men, looking vicious, their vests wide open, surrounding five or six ladies of high elegance, among which were enthroned the inseparable, the little Marquise d'Espanet, in yellow, and the blonde Mrs. Haffner, in purple. M. de Mussy, that cavalier to whose salutation Renee had not replied, was also there, with the worried expression of a lover who feels his leave coming. And, in the middle of the long trains spread out on the carpet, two contractors, two wealthy masons, the Mignons and Charrier, with whom Saccard was to do business the next day, were walking heavily in their sturdy boots, their hands behind their backs, bursting in their coats. black.","In fact, nearly all the guests had arrived. Waiting below were her sister Christine, a young woman of twenty, dressed very simply in white muslin; her Aunt Elisabeth, the widow of the notary Aubertot, in black satin—a little old lady of sixty with an exquisitely friendly manner; her husband’s sister Sidonie Rougon, a skinny, artificial woman of uncertain age with a soft, waxy face that her faded dress made even less memorable; and the Mareuils, father and daughter: a tall, handsome man who had only recently been in mourning for his wife and who, with his blank, serious visage, bore a striking resemblance to the servant Baptiste, and poor Louise, as the daughter was called, a child of seventeen, undersized and slightly hunchbacked, who with sickly grace wore a white twill gown with red polka dots. Then there was a substantial group of grave-looking men: highly decorated gentlemen, officials with pale, solemn faces. Some distance away, another group of young men with a dissolute air about them and coats wide open had gathered around five or six supremely elegant ladies, among whom the reigning queens were the Inseparables, little marquise d’Espanet, in yellow, and blonde Mme Haffner, in violet. M. de Mussy, the horseman whose greeting Renée had ignored that afternoon in the Bois, was also there, with the worried look of a lover who senses that he is about to be sent packing. And amid the long trains of the women’s gowns spread across the carpet, two building contractors, the newly wealthy bricklayers Mignon and Charrier, with whom Saccard was to conclude a piece of business the next day, clumped about in heavy boots, their hands behind their backs, looking ridiculous in their black frock coats.","Most of the guests had, in fact, arrived. She found in the drawing room her sister Christine, a young girl of twenty, very simply dressed in white muslin; her aunt Élisabeth, the widow of Aubertot the notary, an exquisitely charming little old woman of sixty, in black satin; her husband’s sister, Sidonie Rougon, a lean, smooth-tongued woman of indeterminate age, with a complexion like soft wax, made to seem even more waxen by the dull hue of her dress; then the de Mareuils: the father, Monsieur de Mareuil, who was just out of mourning for his wife, a tall, handsome man, shallow and serious, bearing a striking resemblance to the valet Baptiste; and the daughter, poor little Louise as she was called, a child of seventeen, puny, slightly humpbacked, wearing with a sickly grace a white foulard dress with red spots; then a whole group of serious-looking men, with many decorations, official gentlemen with silent, sallow faces, and further on another group, young men with dissolute looks and low-cut waistcoats, standing round five or six ladies of extreme elegance, foremost among whom were the two inseparables, the little Marquise d’Espanet, in yellow, and the fair-haired Madame Haffner, in violet. Monsieur de Mussy, the horseman whose greeting Renée had not acknowledged, was there too, with the uneasy look of a lover who feels his days are numbered. And, among the long trains spread over the carpet, two contractors, two bricklayers who had made a lot of money, Mignon and Charrier, with whom Saccard was to settle a business matter the next day, moved clumsily about in their heavy boots, hands behind their backs, most uncomfortable in their dress-clothes. Aristide Saccard, standing by the door, managed to greet each new arrival while holding forth to the group of serious-looking men with his southern twang and animated manner."
"Angèle croyait que son mari plaisantait. Il avait parfois le goût de la plaisanterie colossale et inquiétante.

"Il rentra tranquillement chez lui, avec une pointe d’admiration pour le baron, qui dénouait si joliment les situations délicates. Il garda le dossier dans sa poche, et, à la séance suivante, il déclara, d’un ton péremptoire, au nom du baron et au sien, qu’entre l’offre de cinq cent mille francs et la demande de sept cent mille francs, il fallait prendre un moyen terme et accorder six cent mille francs. Il n’y eut pas la moindre opposition. Le membre de la rue d’Astorg, qui avait réfléchi sans doute, dit avec une grande bonhomie qu’il s’était trompé : il avait cru qu’il s’agissait de la maison voisine.","He returned home quietly, with a touch of admiration for the Baron, who resolved delicate situations so beautifully. He kept the file in his pocket, and at the next session he declared, in a peremptory tone, in the name of the baron and his own, that between the offer of five hundred thousand francs and the demand of seven hundred thousand francs, it was necessary to take a medium term and grant six hundred thousand francs. There was not the slightest opposition. The member of the rue d'Astorg, who had no doubt reflected, said with great good-naturedness that he had been mistaken: he had thought it was the house next door.","He quietly returned home, feeling a twinge of admiration for the baron, who had such clever ways of extricating himself from ticklish situations. He kept the file in his pocket and at the next meeting of the commission announced peremptorily on behalf of the baron and himself that given the asking price of 700,000 francs and the proposed offer of 500,000, it would be necessary to compromise by granting an indemnity of 600,000. Not a murmur of opposition was heard. The member from the rue d’Astorg, having thought better of his objection, no doubt, allowed good-naturedly that he had been mistaken. He had thought that it was the building next door that was being discussed.","He crept back to his own house, feeling a touch of admiration for the Baron, who had such a skilful way of resolving delicate situations. He kept the report in his pocket, and at the next meeting of the Authority he declared peremptorily, in the Baron’s name and his own, that they should split the difference between the offer of five hundred thousand and the claim of seven hundred thousand francs, and allow six hundred thousand. There was not the slightest opposition. The member from the Rue d’Astorg, who had no doubt thought it over, said good-naturedly that he had made a mistake: he had thought they had been talking about the house next door."
"M. de Mareuil rougissait d’aise. On complimenta Saccard. M. Toutin-Laroche s’offrit comme second témoin. Puis, brusquement, on arriva à parler du divorce. Un membre de l’opposition venait d’avoir « le triste courage », disait M. Haffner, de défendre cette honte sociale. Et tous se récrièrent. Leur pudeur trouva des mots profonds. M. Michelin souriait délicatement au ministre, pendant que les Mignon et Charrier remarquaient avec étonnement que le collet de son habit était usé.","M. de Mareuil blushed with pleasure. Saccard was complimented. M. Toutin-Laroche offered himself as a second witness. Then, suddenly, we got to talking about the divorce. A member of the opposition had just had the ""sad courage"", said Mr. Haffner, to defend this social shame. And all cried out. Their modesty found deep words. M. Michelin smiled delicately at the Minister, while the Mignons and Charrier noticed with astonishment that the collar of his coat was worn.","M. de Mareuil blushed with pleasure. Saccard accepted congratulations. M. Toutin-Laroche offered to serve as a second witness. Then the conversation abruptly turned to the subject of divorce. A member of the opposition had just found what M. Haffner called the “lamentable courage” to defend this social disgrace. This was greeted with cries of protest from all present. Their sense of propriety found profound words in which to express itself. M. Michelin smiled discreetly at the minister, while Mignon and Charrier noted with astonishment that his jacket collar was worn.","Monsieur de Mareuil blushed with delight. Saccard was congratulated. Monsieur Toutin-Laroche offered to be second witness. Then, suddenly, they began to talk of divorce.

"Ce fut ainsi qu’Aristide Saccard remporta sa première victoire. Il quadrupla sa mise de fonds et gagna deux complices. Une seule chose l’inquiéta ; lorsqu’il voulut anéantir les fameux livres de Mme Sidonie, il ne les trouva plus. Il courut chez Larsonneau, qui lui avoua carrément qu’il les avait, en effet, et qu’il les gardait. L’autre ne se fâcha pas ; il sembla dire qu’il n’avait eu de l’inquiétude que pour ce cher ami, beaucoup plus compromis que lui par ces écritures presque entièrement de sa main, mais qu’il était rassuré, du moment où elles se trouvaient en sa possession. Au fond, il eût volontiers étranglé le « cher ami » ; il se souvenait d’une pièce fort compromettante, d’un inventaire faux, qu’il avait eu la bêtise de dresser, et qui devait être resté dans l’un des registres. Larsonneau, payé grassement, alla monter un cabinet d’affaires rue de Rivoli, où il eut des bureaux meublés avec le luxe d’un appartement de fille. Saccard, après avoir quitté l’Hôtel de Ville, pouvant mettre en branle un roulement de fonds considérable, se lança dans la spéculation à outrance, tandis que Renée, grisée, folle, emplissait Paris du bruit de ses équipages, de l’éclat de ses diamants, du vertige de sa vie adorable et tapageuse.","This was how Aristide Saccard won his first victory. He quadrupled his down payment and won two accomplices. Only one thing worried him; when he wanted to destroy Madame Sidonie's famous books, he could not find them. He ran to Larsonneau, who frankly confessed that he had them, indeed, and that he was keeping them. The other was not angry; he seemed to say that he had been worried only for this dear friend, much more compromised than himself by these writings almost entirely in his hand, but that he was reassured, as soon as they were in his possession. . Basically, he would have gladly strangled the ""dear friend""; he remembered a very compromising document, a false inventory, which he had been stupid enough to draw up, and which must have remained in one of the registers. Larsonneau, paid handsomely, went to set up a business office in the rue de Rivoli, where he had offices furnished with the luxury of a girl's apartment. Saccard, after leaving the Hôtel de Ville, able to set in motion a considerable turnover of funds, threw himself into excessive speculation, while Renée, intoxicated, mad, filled Paris with the noise of her carriages, the brilliance of her diamonds, from the vertigo of her adorable and noisy life.","That was how Aristide Saccard won his first victory. He quadrupled his investment and gained two accomplices. Only one thing worried him. When he went to destroy Mme Sidonie’s fraudulent books, they were nowhere to be found. He rushed over to see Larsonneau, who told him bluntly that he had the books and planned to keep them. Saccard did not lose his temper. His only worry, he intimated, was for his dear friend, who was far more compromised than Saccard himself by these forgeries—almost all of which were in his friend’s hand—but he was reassured now that he knew the books to be in Larsonneau’s possession. Actually, he would gladly have strangled his “dear friend.” He remembered one highly compromising document, a bogus inventory that he had been stupid enough to draw up and that must still be in one of the ledgers. Larsonneau, richly rewarded for his services, opened a consulting office on the rue de Rivoli, which he furnished as luxuriously as any kept woman’s apartment. Saccard quit his job at city hall and, with a considerable quantity of capital now at his disposal, plunged into speculation with a vengeance, while Renée, excited and out of control, filled Paris with the clatter of her carriages, the sparkle of her diamonds, and the dizzying whirl of her swank and ostentatious existence.","In this way Aristide Saccard won his first victory. He quadrupled his outlay and gained two accomplices. One thing alone perturbed him: when he wanted to destroy Madame Sidonie’s famous account books, he was unable to find them. He hurried over to see Larsonneau, who brazenly admitted that he had them and that he meant to keep them. Saccard showed no anger; he implied that he had only been concerned for his dear friend, who was far more seriously compromised than himself by the entries, which were almost entirely in his handwriting, but that he was reassured now that he knew they were in his safekeeping. At heart he would gladly have strangled his ‘dear friend’; he remembered a particularly compromising document, a false inventory which he had been fool enough to draw up, and which he knew had been left in one of the ledgers. Larsonneau, handsomely rewarded, set up a broking agency in the Rue de Rivoli, where he had a suite of offices furnished as luxuriously as a courtesan’s apartment. Saccard left the Hôtel de Ville and, being in command of considerable funds to work with, launched furiously into speculation, while Renée filled Paris with the clatter of her equipages, the sparkle of her diamonds, the vertigo of her riotous existence."

"Elle le suivit. À ce moment, Mme Sidonie, qui avait rôdé toute la soirée autour de sa belle-sœur, étonnée de ses promenades continuelles à travers les pièces, arrivait justement sur le perron de la serre. Elle vit les jambes d’un homme s’enfoncer au milieu des ténèbres du petit escalier. Un sourire pâle éclaira son visage de cire, et, retroussant sa jupe de magicienne pour aller plus vite, elle chercha son frère, bouleversant une figure du cotillon, s’adressant aux domestiques qu’elle rencontrait. Elle trouva enfin Saccard avec M. de Mareuil, dans une pièce contiguë à la salle à manger, et que l’on avait transformée provisoirement en fumoir. Les deux pères parlaient de dot, de contrat. Mais quand sa sœur lui eut dit un mot à l’oreille, Saccard se leva, s’excusa, disparut.","She followed him. At this moment Madame Sidonie, who had been prowling around her sister-in-law all evening, amazed at her continual walks through the rooms, had just arrived on the steps of the greenhouse. She saw the legs of a man sink into the darkness of the small staircase. A pale smile lit up her waxen face, and, pulling up her magician's skirt to go more quickly, she looked for her brother, upsetting a figure in the cotillion, addressing the servants she met. She finally found Saccard with M. de Mareuil, in a room adjoining the dining room, which had been temporarily transformed into a smoking room. The two fathers spoke of dowry, of contract. But when his sister had whispered a word in his ear, Saccard got up, excused himself, and disappeared.","She followed. At that moment, Mme Sidonie, who had been prowling around her sister-in-law all evening, astonished by her restless scouting of all the rooms, happened to be coming up the conservatory steps. She saw a man’s legs disappear into the darkness of the small staircase. A pale smile lit up her waxen face, and, hiking up her magician’s skirt in order to move more quickly, she went looking for her brother, disrupting a figure of the cotillion along the way and questioning any servants she ran into. She finally found Saccard with M. de Mareuil in a room off the dining room that had been converted into a temporary smoking room. The two fathers were discussing dowries and marriage contracts. But after Saccard’s sister whispered something in his ear, he got up, excused himself, and disappeared.","She followed. At this moment Madame Sidonie, who had been prowling after her sister-in-law all evening, surprised at her continual wanderings through the rooms, reached the hothouse steps.

But when his sister came up and whispered in his ear, Saccard rose, apologized, and disappeared."
"Cette déclaration, chez elle, dans sa serre, la choqua. Vraiment Mme de Lauwerens aurait dû porter son commerce ailleurs ! Et Renée se serait soulagée à chasser de ses appartements tout ce monde qui criait si fort. Debout devant le bassin, elle regardait l’eau, elle se demandait où Louise et Maxime avaient pu se cacher. L’orchestre jouait toujours cette valse dont le bercement ralenti lui tournait le cœur. C’était insupportable, on ne pouvait réfléchir chez soi. Elle ne savait plus. Elle oubliait que les jeunes gens n’étaient pas encore mariés, et elle se disait que c’était bien simple, qu’ils étaient allés se coucher. Puis elle songea à la salle à manger, elle remonta vivement l’escalier de la serre. Mais, à la porte du grand salon, elle fut arrêtée une seconde fois par une figure du cotillon.","This declaration, at home, in her greenhouse, shocked her. Really Madame de Lauwerens should have taken her business elsewhere! And Renee would have been relieved to chase everyone who was shouting so loudly out of her apartments. Standing in front of the pool, she looked at the water, she wondered where Louise and Maxime had been able to hide. The orchestra was still playing this waltz, the slow rocking of which made his heart spin. It was unbearable, you couldn't think at home. She no longer knew. She forgot that the young people were not yet married, and she told herself that it was very simple, that they had gone to bed. Then she thought of the dining room, she ran up the stairs to the conservatory. But, at the door of the grand salon, she was stopped a second time by a figure from the cotillion.","This declaration, in her own house, her own conservatory, shocked her. Mme de Lauwerens really ought to transact her business elsewhere. Renée would have felt relieved if she could have driven all these loud people out of her house. Standing in front of the pool, she looked at the water and asked herself where Louise and Maxime might have gone to hide. The orchestra was still playing the same waltz, whose slow, swaying melody turned her stomach. It was unbearable not to be able to think in one’s own house. She couldn’t think. Forgetting that the young couple weren’t yet married, she decided that the answer really had to be quite simple: they had gone to bed. Then she thought of the dining room and ran hastily back up the stairs to the house. At the door of the large drawing room, however, her path was again blocked by yet another of the cotillion figures.","This declaration made in her house, in her hothouse, shocked her. Really, Madame de Lauwerens ought to have taken her business elsewhere! Renée would have felt relieved had she been able to turn out of her rooms all these people who were shouting so loudly. Standing before the tank, she looked at the water, wondering where Louise and Maxime could be. The band was still playing the same waltz, whose slow, lilting tune made her feel sick. It was unbearable, not to be able to think in one’s own house. She became confused. She forgot that the young people were not married yet, and she said to herself that no doubt they had gone to bed. Then she thought of the dining room, and quickly ran up the hothouse steps. But, at the door of the ballroom, she was again stopped by a figure of the cotillon."
"— Tu aurais tort d’en mal parler, reprit-elle.

"Renée se leva, torturant ses doigts, faisant craquer ses gants. Et elle resta debout, toute secouée par une cruelle lutte intérieure. Elle ouvrait les lèvres, pour accepter peut-être, lorsqu’un léger coup de sonnette retentit dans la pièce voisine. Mme Sidonie sortit vivement, en entrebâillant une porte qui laissa voir une double rangée de pianos. La jeune femme entendit ensuite un pas d’homme et le bruit étouffé d’une conversation à voix basse. Machinalement, elle alla examiner de plus près la tache jaunâtre dont les matelas avaient barré le mur. Cette tache l’inquiétait, la gênait. Oubliant tout, Maxime, les cinquante mille francs, M. de Saffré, elle revint devant le lit, songeuse : ce lit était bien mieux à l’endroit où il se trouvait auparavant ; il y avait des femmes qui manquaient vraiment de goût ; pour sûr, quand on était couché, on devait avoir la lumière dans les yeux. Et elle vit vaguement se lever, au fond de son souvenir, l’image de l’inconnu du quai Saint-Paul, son roman en deux rendez-vous, cet amour de hasard qu’elle avait goûté là, à cette autre place. Il n’en restait que cette usure du papier peint. Alors cette chambre l’emplit de malaise, et elle s’impatienta de ce bourdonnement de voix qui continuait, dans la pièce voisine.","Renee stood up, twisting her fingers, cracking her gloves. And she remained standing, all shaken by a cruel inner struggle. She was opening her lips, perhaps to accept, when a slight ringing of the doorbell sounded in the next room. Madame Sidonie rushed out, half-opening a door which revealed a double row of pianos. The young woman then heard a man's footsteps and the muffled sound of a low-voiced conversation. Mechanically, she went to examine more closely the yellowish stain with which the mattresses had crossed the wall. This stain worried her, bothered her. Forgetting everything, Maxime, the fifty thousand francs, M. de Saffré, she came back to the bed, pensive: this bed was much better where it had been before; there were women who really lacked taste; for sure, when we were lying down, we had to have the light in our eyes. And she saw rising vaguely, in the depths of her memory, the image of the stranger on the Quai Saint-Paul, her novel in two dates, that love of chance which she had tasted there, in that other place. All that remained was this wear and tear on the wallpaper. Then this room filled her with uneasiness, and she grew impatient with the humming of voices which continued in the next room.","Renée got up, wringing her hands so that her gloves made a crinkling sound. And she remained standing, badly shaken by a cruel inner struggle. She was on the point of parting her lips, perhaps to indicate her acceptance, when a bell rang in the next room. Mme Sidonie rushed out, leaving the door open just enough to reveal two rows of pianos. The young woman then heard a man’s step and muffled echoes of a whispered conservation. Without thinking, she went over to examine the yellow stain the mattress had left on the wall. That stain annoyed her, irritated her. Forgetting everything— Maxime, the 50,000 francs, M. de Saffré—she walked back around the bed, thinking, “It went much better where it was before. Some women truly have no taste. Lying this way you’re bound to have the light in your eyes.” A vague image rose from the depths of her memory, an image of the stranger from the Quai Saint-Paul and of a romance that had consisted of just two encounters—a chance affair she had savored in this very room, with the bed in the other place. All that remained of that affair was that worn spot on the wallpaper. The room now made her very uneasy, and she grew impatient at the continuing buzz of voices from the adjoining room.","Renée stood up, twisting her fingers, making her gloves crack.

Vaguely, in the depths of her memory, she saw the image of the stranger from the Quai Saint-Paul, the romance of her casual affair, indulged in where the bed used to be.

"Une nuit, dans une heure d’angoisse, la jeune femme avait voulu que son amant allât chercher une des peaux d’ours noir. Puis ils s’étaient couchés sur cette fourrure d’encre, au bord d’un bassin, dans la grande allée circulaire. Au-dehors, il gelait terriblement, par un clair de lune limpide. Maxime était arrivé frissonnant, les oreilles et les doigts glacés. La serre se trouvait chauffée à un tel point, qu’il eut une défaillance, sur la peau de bête. Il entrait dans une flamme si lourde, au sortir des piqûres sèches du froid, qu’il éprouvait des cuissons, comme si on l’eût battu de verges. Quand il revint à lui, il vit Renée agenouillée, penchée, avec des yeux fixes, une attitude brutale qui lui fit peur. Les cheveux tombés, les épaules nues, elle s’appuyait sur ses poings, l’échine allongée, pareille à une grande chatte aux yeux phosphorescents. Le jeune homme, couché sur le dos, aperçut, au-dessus des épaules de cette adorable bête amoureuse qui le regardait, le sphinx de marbre, dont la lune éclairait les cuisses luisantes. Renée avait la pose et le sourire du monstre à tête de femme, et, dans ses jupons dénoués, elle semblait la sœur blanche de ce dieu noir.","One night, in an hour of anguish, the young woman had wanted her lover to go and fetch one of the black bear skins. Then they lay down on this inky fur, at the edge of a pool, in the great circular alley. Outside it was freezing terribly, in clear moonlight. Maxime had arrived shivering, his ears and fingers frozen. The greenhouse was so heated that he fainted on the animal skin. He entered into such a heavy flame, coming out of the dry pricks of the cold, that he felt burning, as if he had been beaten with rods. When he came to, he saw Renee kneeling, bent over, with fixed eyes, a brutal attitude that frightened him. Her hair down, her shoulders bare, she leaned on her fists, her spine elongated, like a big cat with phosphorescent eyes. The young man, lying on his back, perceived, above the shoulders of this adorable amorous beast who was watching him, the marble sphinx, whose shining thighs the moon lit up. Renee had the pose and the smile of the monster with the head of a woman, and, in her loose petticoats, she looked like the white sister of this black god.","One night, in an hour of anguish, the young woman asked her lover to fetch one of the black bearskins.

"Le merveilleux était que sa caisse semblait inépuisable.

"Elle déposa doucement le petit os dans son assiette. Le ronflement des voitures continuait, sans qu’une note plus vive s’élevât. Elle était obligée de hausser la voix pour qu’il pût l’entendre, et les rougeurs de ses joues augmentaient. Il y avait encore, sur la console, des truffes, un entremets sucré, des asperges, une curiosité pour la saison. Il apporta le tout, pour ne plus avoir à se déranger, et comme la table était un peu étroite, il plaça à terre, entre elle et lui, un seau d’argent plein de glace, dans lequel se trouvait une bouteille de champagne. L’appétit de la jeune femme finissait par le gagner. Ils touchèrent à tous les plats, ils vidèrent la bouteille de champagne, avec des gaietés brusques, se lançant dans des théories scabreuses, s’accoudant comme deux amis qui soulagent leur cœur, après boire. Le bruit diminuait sur le boulevard ; mais elle l’entendait au contraire qui grandissait, et toutes ces roues, par instants, semblaient lui tourner dans la tête.","She gently placed the small bone on her plate. The roar of the cars continued, without a louder note rising. She had to raise her voice so he could hear her, and the blush on her cheeks increased. There were still, on the console, truffles, a sweet dessert, asparagus, a curiosity for the season. He brought everything, so as not to have to disturb himself any longer, and as the table was a little narrow, he placed on the floor, between her and him, a silver bucket full of ice, in which was a bottle of champagne. The appetite of the young woman ended up winning him over. They touched all the dishes, they emptied the bottle of champagne, with abrupt gaiety, launching into scabrous theories, leaning on their elbows like two friends relieving their hearts after drinking. The noise diminished on the boulevard; but, on the contrary, she heard him grow taller, and all these wheels, at times, seemed to turn in her head.","She gently laid the small bone on her plate. The rumble of carriages continued, but no particular sound stood out from the dull roar. She was obliged to raise her voice so that he could hear her, and her cheeks grew redder. On the serving table there remained truffles, a sweet side-dish, and asparagus, unusual for that time of year. He brought everything to the table so as not to have to get up again, and since the surface was rather narrow, he set down on the floor between himself and Renée a silver bucket filled with ice and a bottle of champagne. In the end her appetite proved contagious. They sampled all the dishes and in high spirits emptied the bottle of champagne, proposing scandalous theories while leaning on their elbows like two friends letting themselves go after a bout of drinking. The noise from the boulevard died down, but to her it sounded louder, and at times all those wheels seemed to be turning round in her head.","She put the little bone gently on her plate. The rumbling of the carriages continued, with no clearer sound rising above it. She had had to raise her voice for him to hear her, and her flushed cheeks grew even redder. On the slab there were still some truffles, a sweet, and some asparagus, which was out of season. He brought them all over, so as not to have to get up again; and as the table was rather narrow, he placed on the floor between them a silver ice-bucket containing a bottle of champagne. Renée’s appetite had rubbed off on him. They tasted all the dishes and emptied the bottle of champagne, launching into risqué theories and putting their elbows on the table like two friends pouring their hearts out while drinking. The noise on the boulevard was subsiding; but to Renée’s ears it seemed to increase, and at moments all the wheels of the carriages seemed to be whirling round in her head."
"Et la grande joie de la chambre des enfants était encore le vaste horizon. Des autres fenêtres de l’hôtel, on ne voyait, en face de soi, que des murs noirs, à quelques pieds.","And the great joy of the children's room was still the vast horizon. From the other windows of the hotel, you could only see the black walls in front of you, a few feet away.",The best thing about the children’s room was the vast horizon. Looking out the other windows of the house one saw nothing but black walls a few feet away.,"But the great delight of the children’s room was the vast horizon. From the other windows of the house there was nothing to look at but black walls, a few feet away."
"Mais, à cette heure, l’ombre tombait des arbres, la façade dormait. De l’autre côté, dans la cour, le valet de pied avait respectueusement aidé Renée à descendre de voiture. Les écuries, à bandes de briques rouges, ouvraient, à droite, leurs larges portes de chêne bruni, au fond d’un hangar vitré. À gauche, comme pour faire pendant, il y avait, collée au mur de la maison voisine, une niche très ornée, dans laquelle une nappe d’eau coulait perpétuellement d’une coquille que deux Amours tenaient à bras tendus. La jeune femme resta un instant au bas du perron, donnant de légères tapes à sa jupe, qui ne voulait point descendre. La cour, que venaient de traverser les bruits de l’attelage, reprit sa solitude, son silence aristocratique, coupé par l’éternelle chanson de la nappe d’eau. Et seules encore, dans la masse noire de l’hôtel, où le premier des grands dîners de l’automne allait bientôt allumer les lustres, les fenêtres basses flambaient, toutes braisillantes, jetant sur le petit pavé de la cour, régulier et net comme un damier, des lueurs vives d’incendie.","But at this hour the shadow fell from the trees, the facade slept. On the other side, in the yard, the footman had respectfully helped Renee out of the car. The stables, with bands of red brick, opened, on the right, their wide doors of burnished oak, at the back of a glazed shed. On the left, as if to make a pendant, there was, glued to the wall of the neighboring house, a very ornate niche, in which a sheet of water flowed perpetually from a shell which two Cupids held with outstretched arms. The young woman remained for a moment at the bottom of the steps, patting her skirt lightly, which would not come down. The yard, which had just been crossed by the sounds of the team, resumed its solitude, its aristocratic silence, broken by the eternal song of the sheet of water. And still alone, in the black mass of the hotel, where the first of the great autumn dinners were soon to light the chandeliers, the low windows a checkerboard, bright gleams of fire.","Just now, however, darkness was gathering under the trees, and the façade lay sleeping. In the courtyard, a footman had respectfully helped Renée down from the carriage. On the right were the stables, with walls of striped red brick and broad doors of brown oak that opened onto a large area lit by skylights. On the left, as if to balance the composition, a very ornate niche was embedded in the wall of the house next door, in which a stream of water flowed perpetually from a shell that two Cupids held in outstretched arms. The young woman stood for a moment at the bottom of the stairs, lightly tapping at her skirt, which refused to hang properly. The courtyard, into which the clatter of horses and carriage had erupted only a moment earlier, now sank back into solitude, its aristocratic silence broken only by the eternal refrain of running water. In all the dark mass of the mansion, whose chandeliers would soon be lit for the first great banquet of the fall season, only the lower windows were ablaze, coloring the neat, regular checkerboard of small paving stones with the intense glow of a roaring conflagration.","But at this moment the shadows were falling from the trees, and the façade slept. On the other side, in the courtyard, the footman was respectfully helping Renée to alight. At the far end of a glass covered-way on the right, the stables, banded with red brick, opened wide their doors of polished oak. On the left, as if for balance, built into the wall of the adjacent house, there was a decorative niche, within which a sheet of water flowed continuously from a shell which two Cupids held in their outstretched arms. Renée stood for a moment at the foot of the steps, gently tapping her dress, which refused to fall properly. The courtyard, which had just been filled with the noise of the equipage, was empty again, its aristocratic silence broken only by the ceaseless murmur of the flowing water. In the black mass made by the house, where the first of the great autumn dinner-parties was presently to require the chandeliers to be lit, the bottom windows alone were illuminated, glowing brightly and casting reflections on the little cobblestones of the courtyard, neat and regular as a draughtboard."
"Renée, toute pâle, s’était redressée comme sous un coup de fouet. Une immense fierté lui remontait au cœur. Ce bruit de bottes, qu’elle entendait plus brutal dans la chambre d’à côté, l’exaspérait.","Renée, quite pale, straightened up as if under a whiplash. An immense pride rose in his heart. This noise of boots, which she heard more brutally in the next room, exasperated her.","Renée, who had turned quite pale, straightened as if lashed by a whip. Her pride returned with a vengeance. The sound of boots in the next room, now ominously brutal, exasperated her.","Renée, very pale, had drawn herself up as though struck with a whip. A feeling of infinite pride rose within her. The rough creaking of boots, which she could now hear more distinctly in the next room, exasperated her."
"— Vois-tu, dit-il à son fils, ça n’a qu’un temps, mon petit… On y perd sa santé, et l’on n’y goûte pas le vrai bonheur. Tu sais que je ne suis pas un bourgeois. Eh bien, j’en ai assez, je me range.","""You see,"" he said to his son, ""it's only for a short time, my little one... You lose your health there, and you don't taste true happiness there."" You know I'm not a bourgeois. Well, I've had enough, I'm getting over it.","“You see,” he said to his son, “that sort of thing doesn’t last. . . . You lose your health that way without enjoying real happiness. You know I’m no prude. Well, I’ve had enough. I’m going to settle down.”","‘You see,’ he told his son, ‘that only lasts for a while, my boy. It’s not good for your health, and it doesn’t give you real happiness. You know I’m not a Puritan. But I’ve had enough of it; I’m going to settle down.’"
"Alors il lui parla de Louise. Et il marcha plus doucement, pour terminer cette affaire, disait-il, puisqu’ils en causaient. La chose était complètement arrangée. Il lui apprit même qu’il avait fixé avec M. de Mareuil la date de la signature du contrat au dimanche qui suivrait le jeudi de la mi-carême. Ce jeudi-là, il devait y avoir une grande soirée à l’hôtel du parc Monceau, et il en profiterait pour annoncer publiquement le mariage. Maxime trouva tout cela très bien. Il était débarrassé de Renée, il ne voyait plus d’obstacle, il se livrait à son père comme il s’était livré à sa belle-mère.","So he told her about Louise. And he walked more slowly, to finish this affair, he said, since they were talking about it. The thing was completely settled. He even informed her that he had fixed with M. de Mareuil the date of the signing of the contract for the Sunday following the Thursday of mid-Lent. That Thursday, there was to be a big party at the Hôtel du Parc Monceau, and he would take the opportunity to publicly announce the marriage. Maxime found all this very good. He was rid of Renée, he no longer saw any obstacle, he gave himself up to his father as he had given himself up to his stepmother.","Then he brought up Louise. He slackened his pace and said that since they were already talking about marriage, now was the time to settle the matter. He informed Maxime that he and M. de Mareuil had set the Sunday after Mid-Lent Thursday12 as the date for signing the marriage contract. That night there was to be a big party at the Parc Monceau house, and he would take advantage of the occasion to announce the marriage publicly. Maxime was quite pleased with these arrangements. He was done with Renée and saw nothing else standing in the way, so he surrendered himself to his father as he had surrendered himself to his stepmother.","Then he talked about Louise. He walked more slowly, to finish the business, he said, since they were on the subject. Everything was arranged.

Maxime thought all this very satisfactory. He was rid of Renée, he saw no further obstacle, he surrendered to his father as he had surrendered to his stepmother."
"Renée, qui connaissait la chambre, y éprouvait cette vague sensation de malaise que procure à un promeneur un coin de forêt coupé dans un paysage aimé.","Renée, who knew the room, felt there that vague sensation of uneasiness that a corner of the forest gives a walker cut in a beloved landscape.","Renée, who was familiar with this bedroom, felt a vague sense of unease, like a hiker who notices that a patch of forest has been cut from a familiar landscape.","Renée, who knew the room, experienced the vague sense of unease a traveller feels on finding that some trees have been felled in a favourite forest walk."
"Un roulement continu entrait par la fenêtre grande ouverte, et sur le plafond, dans les reflets du café d’en bas, passaient les ombres rapides des promeneurs. Mais, d’un coup de pouce, le garçon haussa le gaz. Les ombres du plafond disparurent, le cabinet s’emplit d’une lumière crue qui tomba en plein sur la tête de la jeune femme. Elle avait déjà rejeté son capuchon en arrière. Les petits frisons s’étaient un peu ébouriffés dans le fiacre, mais le ruban bleu n’avait pas bougé. Elle se mit à marcher, gênée par la façon dont Charles la regardait ; il avait un clignement d’yeux, un pincement de paupières, pour mieux la voir, qui signifiait clairement : « En voilà une que je ne connais pas encore. »","A continuous rolling entered through the wide open window, and on the ceiling, in the reflections of the cafe below, passed the rapid shadows of the walkers. But, with a nudge, the boy raised the gas. The shadows on the ceiling disappeared, the study was filled with harsh light which fell squarely on the young woman's head. She had already thrown her hood back. The little Friesians had gotten a little disheveled in the cab, but the blue ribbon hadn't moved. She began to walk, embarrassed by the way Charles was looking at her; he blinked, twitched, the better to see her, which clearly signified: ""Here's one I don't know yet."" »","A constant rumble of traffic could be heard through the wide-open window, and the play of light from the café below projected onto the ceiling shadows of pedestrians hurrying past. With a quick twist of the wrist, however, the waiter turned up the light from the gas jet. The shadows on the ceiling disappeared, and a harsh light filled the room, illuminating the young woman’s face. She had already pulled back her hood. Her little curls had been mussed a bit in the cab, but the blue ribbon had not budged. She began to move about, embarrassed by the way that Charles was looking at her. He blinked and squinted to get a better look at her in a way that clearly said, “Now here’s one I’ve never seen before.”","A continuous rumbling could be heard through the wide-open window, and on the ceiling, in the reflection cast by the café below, the shadows of the people in the street passed swiftly by.

She began to walk about, a little embarrassed by the way Charles looked at her; he blinked and screwed up his eyes to see her better, in a way that plainly suggested: ‘ Here’s one I haven’t seen before.’"
"Aristide Saccard s’approcha, s’inclina, fit de la modestie. Mais son visage grimaçant trahissait une satisfaction vive. Et il regardait du coin de l’œil les deux entrepreneurs, les deux maçons enrichis, plantés à quelques pas, écoutant sonner les chiffres de quinze mille et de cinquante mille francs, avec un respect visible.","Aristide Saccard approached, bowed, showed modesty.

"L’arbuste derrière lequel elle se cachait à demi, était une plante maudite, un Tanghin de Madagascar, aux larges feuilles de buis, aux tiges blanchâtres, dont les moindres nervures distillent un lait empoisonné. Et, à un moment, comme Louise et Maxime riaient plus haut, dans le reflet jaune, dans le coucher de soleil du petit salon, Renée, l’esprit perdu, la bouche sèche et irritée, prit entre ses lèvres un rameau du Tanghin, qui lui venait à la hauteur des dents, et mordit une des feuilles amères.","The shrub behind which she was half hiding was a cursed plant, a Tanghin from Madagascar, with large boxwood leaves, whitish stems, the smallest veins of which distil poisonous milk.

At a moment when Louise and Maxime laughed more loudly in the reflected yellow light of the sunset in the little boudoir, Renée, her mind wandering, her mouth dry and parched, took between her lips a sprig of the tanghin tree that was level with her mouth, and sank her teeth into one of its bitter leaves."
"Mais l’enfant l’interrompit, se haussant, lui disant à l’oreille :","But the child interrupted him, rising, whispering in his ear:","But the child interrupted, rising up on her toes to whisper in Renée’s ear.","The child interrupted her, rising on tiptoe to speak in her ear:"

"Au mot de terrain, Saccard avait eu un léger tressaillement. Sous son indifférence jouée, il écoutait avec une attention profonde. La tante Élisabeth se troublait, ne trouvait sans doute pas la phrase, et en rougissant : — Seulement, continua-t-elle, je désire que la propriété de ces terrains soit reportée sur la tête du premier enfant de Renée. Vous comprendrez mon intention, je ne veux pas que cet enfant puisse un jour être à votre charge. Dans le cas où il mourrait, Renée resterait seule propriétaire.","At the word field, Saccard gave a slight start. Beneath his playful indifference, he listened with profound attention.

You will understand my intention, I do not want this child to be dependent on you one day. In the event that he died, Renée would remain the sole owner.","At the mention of “holdings in land,” Saccard gave a slight start. Still feigning indifference, he was now all ears.

You will surely understand my intention: I do not want this child to be a burden to you someday. If the child should die, Renée would remain sole owner of the property.”","At the word ‘land’ Saccard started slightly. In spite of his assumed indifference he was listening intently. Aunt Élisabeth became confused, apparently at a loss for the right expression, and continued, blushing: ‘But I want the ownership of this land to be transferred to Renée’s first child. You understand why. I don’t want this child ever to be your responsibility. If the child died, Renée would become the sole owner.’"

"Mais sa gloire la plus pure était le Crédit viticole, qu’il avait fondé avec Toutin-Laroche. Celui-ci s’en trouvait le directeur officiel ; lui ne paraissait que comme membre du conseil de surveillance. Eugène, en cette circonstance, avait encore donné un bon coup de main à son frère. Grâce à lui, le gouvernement autorisa la compagnie, et la surveilla avec une grande bonhomie. En une délicate circonstance, comme un journal mal pensant se permettait de critiquer une opération de cette compagnie, le Moniteur[21] alla jusqu’à publier une note interdisant toute discussion sur une maison si honorable, et que l’État daignait patronner. Le Crédit viticole s’appuyait sur un excellent système financier : il prêtait aux cultivateurs la moitié du prix d’estimation de leurs biens, garantissait le prêt par une hypothèque, et touchait des emprunteurs les intérêts, augmentés d’un acompte d’amortissement. Jamais mécanisme ne fut plus digne ni plus sage. Eugène avait déclaré à son frère, avec un fin sourire, que les Tuileries voulaient qu’on fût honnête. M. Toutin-Laroche interpréta ce désir en laissant fonctionner tranquillement la machine des prêts aux cultivateurs, et en établissant à côté une maison de banque qui attirait à elle les capitaux et qui jouait avec fièvre, se lançant dans toutes les aventures. Grâce à l’impulsion formidable que le directeur lui donna, le Crédit viticole eut bientôt une réputation de solidité et de prospérité à toute épreuve. Au début, pour lancer d’un coup, à la Bourse, une masse d’actions fraîchement détachées de la souche, et leur donner l’aspect de titres ayant déjà beaucoup circulé, Saccard eut l’ingéniosité de les faire piétiner et battre, pendant toute une nuit, par les garçons de recette armés de balais de bouleau. On eût dit une succursale de la Banque. L’hôtel, occupé par les bureaux, avec sa cour pleine d’équipages, ses grillages sévères, son large perron et son escalier monumental, ses enfilades de cabinets luxueux, son monde d’employés et de laquais en livrée, semblait être le temple grave et digne de l’argent ; et rien ne frappait le public d’une émotion plus religieuse, que le sanctuaire, que la Caisse, où conduisait un corridor d’une nudité sacrée, et où l’on apercevait le coffre-fort, le dieu, accroupi, scellé au mur, trapu et dormant, avec ses trois serrures, ses flancs épais, son air de brute divine.","But his purest glory was the Crédit viticole, which he had founded with Toutin-Laroche. This was the official director; he appeared only as a member of the Supervisory Board. Eugene, on this occasion, had again given his brother a good helping hand. Thanks to him, the government authorized the company, and supervised it with great kindness. In a delicate circumstance, as an ill-meaning newspaper took the liberty of criticizing an operation of this company, the Moniteur[21] went so far as to publish a note prohibiting any discussion of such an honorable house, and which the State deigned to patronize. The Crédit viticole relied on an excellent financial system: it lent farmers half of the estimated price of their property, guaranteed the loan by a mortgage, and received interest from borrowers, plus a down payment. Never was mechanism more dignified or wiser. Eugene had declared to his brother, with a shrewd smile, that the Tuileries wanted us to be honest. M. Toutin-Laroche interpreted this desire by letting the machinery of loans to farmers operate quietly, and by establishing a banking house alongside it which attracted capital and which played feverishly, throwing itself into all sorts of adventures. Thanks to the tremendous impetus given to it by the director, the Crédit viticole soon had a reputation for unfailing solidity and prosperity. At first, in order to launch a mass of shares freshly detached from the stump on the Stock Exchange, and give them the appearance of securities that had already circulated a great deal, Saccard had the ingenuity to have them trampled and beaten, for a whole night, by recipe boys armed with birch brooms. It looked like a bank branch. The hotel, occupied by the offices, with its courtyard full of carriages, its severe fences, its wide steps and its monumental staircase, its rows of luxurious cabinets, its world of clerks and lackeys in livery, seemed to be the temple serious and worthy of money; and nothing struck the public with a more religious emotion than the sanctuary, than the Caisse, where a corridor of sacred nudity led, and where one could see the safe, the god, squatting, sealed to the wall. , stocky and sleepy, with his three locks, his thick sides, his air of divine brute.","His greatest claim to fame, however, was the Crédit Viticole, which he had founded with Toutin-Laroche. The latter was officially in charge; Saccard figured only as a member of the board of directors. In this instance Eugène had once again done his brother an important favor. Thanks to him, the government had granted the company authorization to do business and watched over its operations most indulgently. At a particularly ticklish moment, when a hostile newspaper took the liberty of criticizing something the company had done, the official government bulletin went so far as to publish a note banning all discussion of a firm so honorable that the state itself deigned to sponsor it. The Crédit Viticole relied on an excellent system of financing: it lent farmers up to half the estimated value of their property, guaranteed the loan with a mortgage, and collected interest plus amortization from the borrowers. No system was ever more prudent or proper. With a knowing smile Eugène had told his brother that the Tuileries wanted everything aboveboard. Interpreting this wish to suit himself, M. Toutin-Laroche allowed the lending machinery to operate without interference while he set up alongside it a bank that attracted capital, which he then used to gamble with abandon, plunging headlong into any number of ventures. Thanks to the energetic leadership of its managing director, the Crédit Viticole soon enjoyed an unshakable reputation as a solid and prosperous firm. At first, when Saccard wanted to put a large number of new shares on the market all at once, he was shrewd enough to make it look as though they had been in circulation for a long time by having bank tellers spend the night tromping on them and beating them with birch brooms. The bank’s premises were designed to make it look like a branch office of the Bank of France. The headquarters, with its many offices, courtyard full of carriages, austere iron railings, broad stoop and monumental staircase, suites of sumptuous private rooms, and uniformed personnel and factotums, stood forth as a grave and dignified temple of money, and nothing inspired a more religious emotion in the public than the sanctuary, the counting room, to which one gained access by way of a corridor notable for its sacred nudity, there to glimpse the safe, the god, crouched down, secured to the wall, squat and somnolent, with its triple locks, thick flanks, and air of brute divinity.","But his greatest triumph was the Crédit Viticole, which he had founded with Toutin-Laroche. The latter was the official director; Saccard only figured as a member of the board. In this connection Eugène had done his brother another good turn. Thanks to him the Government authorized the company and watched indulgently over its career. On one delicate occasion, when a hostile newspaper ventured to criticize one of the company’s operations, the Moniteur* went so far as to publish a note forbidding any discussion of so honourable an undertaking, one which the State deigned to protect. The Crédit Viticole was based on an excellent financial system: it lent the winegrowers half of the estimated value of their property, ensured the repayment of the loan by a mortgage, and received interest from the borrowers in addition to instalments of the principal. Never was there a mechanism more prudent or more worthy. Eugène had declared to his brother, with a knowing smile, that the Tuileries expected people to be honest. Monsieur Toutin-Laroche interpreted this wish by allowing the wine-growers’ loan office to work quietly, and founding by its side a banking house which attracted capital and gambled feverishly, launching into every sort of adventure. Thanks to the formidable impulse it received from its director, the Crédit Viticole soon established a solid reputation for security and prosperity. At the outset, in order to offer at the Bourse in one job a mass of shares on which no dividend had yet been paid, and to give them the appearance of having been in circulation for some time, Saccard had the ingenuity to have them trodden on and beaten, a whole night long, by the bank-messengers, armed with birch-brooms. The place was like a branch of the Banque de France. The house occupied by the offices, with its courtyard full of private carriages, its austere iron railings, its broad flight of steps and monumental staircase, its suites of luxurious reception rooms, its army of clerks and liveried lackeys, seemed to be the grave, dignified temple of Mammon; and nothing filled the public with a more religious emotion than the sanctuary, the cashier’s office, which was approached by a corridor of hallowed bareness and contained the safe, the god, crouching, embedded in the wall, squat and somnolent, with its triple lock, its massive flanks, its air of a brute divinity."
"Saccard eût volontiers cherché un autre associé. Mais il avait toujours des inquiétudes au sujet de l’inventaire faux que Larsonneau gardait précieusement. Il préféra le mettre dans l’affaire, comptant profiter de quelque circonstance pour rentrer en possession de cette pièce compromettante. Larsonneau bâtit le café-concert, une construction en planches et en plâtras, surmontée de clochetons de fer-blanc, qu’il fit peinturlurer en jaune et en rouge. Le jardin et les jeux eurent du succès dans le quartier populeux de Charonne. Au bout de deux ans, la spéculation paraissait prospère, bien que les bénéfices fussent réellement très faibles. Saccard, jusqu’alors, n’avait parlé qu’avec enthousiasme à sa femme de l’avenir d’une si belle idée.","Saccard would gladly have sought another partner. But he still had concerns about the fake inventory that Larsonneau was keeping. He preferred to put him in the case, counting on taking advantage of some circumstance to regain possession of this compromising document. Larsonneau built the café-concert, a construction of planks and plaster, topped with tin pinnacles, which he had painted yellow and red. The garden and the games were successful in the populous district of Charonne. After two years, the speculation seemed to be prosperous, although the profits were really very small. Saccard, until then, had spoken only with enthusiasm to his wife of the future of such a fine idea.","Saccard would gladly have sought out a different partner, but he was still worried about the fake inventory that Larsonneau guarded like a precious possession.

After two years, the speculation seemed to have prospered, although the profits were really quite small. Thus far Saccard had spoken to his wife of the future of this fine idea only in the most glowing of terms.","Saccard would gladly have looked for another partner.

"— Écoutez, dit M. Hupel de la Noue, que les Mignon et Charrier, las de mythologie, avaient entraîné au buffet, nous n’aurons rien, si nous ne faisons pas cause commune… C’est bien pis aux Tuileries, et j’y ai acquis quelque expérience… Chargez-vous du vin, je me charge de la viande.","""Listen,"" said M.

It is much worse at the Tuileries, and I acquired some experience there… Take care of the wine, I take care of the meat.","“Listen,” said M. Hupel de la Noue, whom Mignon and Charrier, tired of mythology, had dragged off to the buffet, “we won’t get anything unless we join forces. . . . It’s worse at the Tuileries, and I’ve had some experience there. . . .

"Quand on ouvrit la porte de la salle à manger, transformée en buffet, avec des dressoirs contre les murs et une longue table au milieu, chargée de viandes froides, ce fut une poussée, un écrasement. Un grand bel homme, qui avait eu la timidité de garder son chapeau à la main, fut si violemment collé contre le mur, que le malheureux chapeau creva avec une plainte sourde. Cela fit rire. On se ruait sur les pâtisseries et les volailles truffées, en s’enfonçant les coudes dans les côtes, brutalement. C’était un pillage, les mains se rencontraient au milieu des viandes, et les laquais ne savaient à qui répondre, au milieu de cette bande d’hommes comme il faut, dont les bras tendus exprimaient la seule crainte d’arriver trop tard et de trouver les plats vides. Un vieux monsieur se fâcha parce qu’il n’y avait pas de bordeaux, et que le champagne, assurait-il, l’empêchait de dormir.","When we opened the door to the dining room, transformed into a buffet, with sideboards against the walls and a long table in the middle, laden with cold meats, there was a push, a crush.

We rushed on pastries and truffled poultry, digging our elbows into the ribs, brutally. It was looting, hands met in the middle of the meat, and the lackeys didn't know who to answer to, in the middle of this band of decent men, whose outstretched arms expressed the sole fear of arriving too late and to find the empty dishes. An old gentleman got angry because there was no claret, and the champagne, he claimed, kept him awake.","The dining room had been transformed into a buffet with sideboards along the walls and a long table laden with cold cuts in the middle, and when the doors were opened there was a push, a crush.

The guests swooped down on the pastries and truffled fowl, and the servants did not know which of this gang of well-bred gentlemen to serve first, since all had their hands out, baring their fear of getting to the food too late and finding the platters empty.

"Les convives étaient trop nombreux pour que la conversation pût aisément devenir générale. Cependant, au second service, lorsque les rôtis et les entremets eurent pris la place des relevés et des entrées, et que les grands vins de Bourgogne, le pommard, le chambertin, succédèrent au léoville et au château-laffite, le bruit des voix grandit, des éclats de rire firent tinter les cristaux légers. Renée, au milieu de la table, avait, à sa droite le baron Gouraud, à sa gauche M. Toutin-Laroche, ancien fabricant de bougies, alors conseiller municipal, directeur du Crédit viticole, membre du conseil de surveillance de la Société générale des ports du Maroc, homme maigre et considérable, que Saccard, placé en face, entre Mme d’Espanet et Mme Haffner, appelait d’une voix flatteuse tantôt « Mon cher collègue », et tantôt « Notre grand administrateur ». Ensuite venaient les hommes politiques : M. Hupel de la Noue, un préfet qui passait huit mois de l’année à Paris ; trois députés, parmi lesquels M. Haffner étalait sa large face alsacienne ; puis M. de Saffré, un charmant jeune homme, secrétaire d’un ministre ; M. Michelin, chef du bureau de la voirie ; et d’autres employés supérieurs. M. de Mareuil, candidat perpétuel à la députation, se carrait en face du préfet, auquel il faisait les yeux doux. Quant à M. d’Espanet, il n’accompagnait jamais sa femme dans le monde. Les dames de la famille étaient placées entre les plus marquants de ces personnages. Saccard avait cependant réservé sa sœur Sidonie, qu’il avait mise plus loin, entre les deux entrepreneurs, le sieur Charrier à droite, le sieur Mignon à gauche, comme à un poste de confiance où il s’agissait de vaincre. Mme Michelin, la femme du chef de bureau, une jolie brune, toute potelée, se trouvait à côté de M. de Saffré, avec lequel elle causait vivement à voix basse. Puis, aux deux bouts de la table, était la jeunesse : des auditeurs au Conseil d’État, des fils de pères puissants, des petits millionnaires en herbe, M. de Mussy, qui jetait à Renée des regards désespérés, Maxime ayant à sa droite Louise de Mareuil, et dont sa voisine semblait faire la conquête. Peu à peu, ils s’étaient mis à rire très haut. Ce fut de là que partirent les premiers éclats de gaieté.","The guests were too numerous for the conversation to easily become general. However, at the second course, when roasts and entremets had taken the place of notes and starters, and the great wines of Burgundy, Pommard, Chambertin, succeeded Léoville and Château-Laffite, the noise of voices grew louder. , bursts of laughter made the light crystals tinkle. Renée, in the middle of the table, had, on her right Baron Gouraud, on her left M. Toutin-Laroche, a former candle maker, then municipal councilor, director of the Crédit viticole, member of the supervisory board of the Société Générale des ports of Morocco, a thin and considerable man, whom Saccard, seated opposite, between Madame d'Espanet and Madame Haffner, called in a flattering voice sometimes ""My dear colleague"" and sometimes ""Our great administrator."" Then came the politicians: M. Hupel de la Noue, a prefect who spent eight months of the year in Paris; three deputies, among whom M. Haffner displayed his broad Alsatian face; then M. de Saffré, a charming young man, secretary to a minister; Mr. Michelin, head of the roads office; and other senior employees. M. de Mareuil, perpetual candidate for deputy, squared himself in front of the prefect, at whom he made eyes. As for M. d'Espanet, he never accompanied his wife into society. The ladies of the family were placed among the most prominent of these characters. Saccard had, however, reserved his sister Sidonie, whom he had placed further away, between the two contractors, the Sieur Charrier on the right, the Sieur Mignon on the left, as if in a position of confidence where it was a question of victory. Madame Michelin, the office manager's wife, a pretty, chubby brunette, was next to Monsieur de Saffré, with whom she was chatting briskly in a low voice. Then, at both ends of the table, were the young people: auditors at the Council of State, sons of powerful fathers, budding little millionaires, M. de Mussy, who was casting despairing glances at Renée, Maxime having his right Louise de Mareuil, and which her neighbor seemed to conquer. Gradually, they began to laugh very loudly. It was from there that the first bursts of gaiety came.","The guests were too numerous to allow for easy general conversation. By the time the second course was served, however, and roasts and sweets had taken the place of savories and appetizers and great Burgundy wines—a Pommard and a Chambertin—had supplanted the Léoville and Château-Lafitte, 12 the sound of voices had grown louder, and bursts of laughter made the fine crystal ring. Renée, seated at the middle of the table, had Baron Gouraud on her right and, on her left, M. Toutin-Laroche, formerly a candle manufacturer but now a city councilor, director of the Crédit Viticole, and member of the board of overseers of the Société Générale des Ports du Maroc, a slender yet substantial individual, whom Saccard, seated opposite between Mme d’Espanet and Mme Haffner, referred to in a flattering voice now as “my dear colleague” and now as “our illustrious administrator.” Then came the politicians: M. Hupel de la Noue, a prefect who spent eight months a year in Paris; three deputies, among whom M. Haffner displayed his broad Alsatian face; M. de Saffré, a charming young man who served as secretary to a minister; M. Michelin, the head of the bureau of roads; and other high-level bureaucrats. M. de Mareuil, a perpetual candidate for a seat as deputy, settled in opposite the prefect, at whom he made eyes. As for M. d’Espanet, he never joined his wife for social occasions. The ladies of the family were seated among the most prominent of these personages. Saccard had nevertheless reserved a special role for his sister Sidonie, whom he had placed farther down the table, between the two contractors, with the estimable Charrier on her right and the honorable Mignon on her left—a position of trust in which victory was essential. Mme Michelin, the wife of the bureau chief, a pretty brunette, amply endowed, was seated next to M. de Saffré, with whom she chatted eagerly in a low voice. Finally, at either end of the table sat the young people: auditors from the Conseil d’Etat,13 sons of powerful fathers, budding young millionaires, M. de Mussy, who darted desperate looks in Renée’s direction, and Maxime, with Louise de Mareuil on his right seemingly holding him in her thrall. The gales of laughter coming from their direction slowly gained in volume. Gaiety gradually spread from their corner to the rest of the table.","The guests were too numerous for the conversation to become general. Nevertheless, with the second course, when the game and side-dishes had replaced the removes and entrées, and the great wines of Burgundy, Pomard, and Chambertin succeeded the Léoville and Château-Lafitte, the sound of voices increased, and bursts of laughter made the thin crystal ring. Renée, seated at the middle of the table, had on her right Baron Gouraud, and on her left Monsieur Toutin-Laroche,* a retired candle-manufacturer and now a municipal councillor, a director of the Crédit Viticole,* and a member of the committee of inspection of the Société Générale of the Ports of Morocco,* a lean, important person, whom Saccard, sitting opposite between Madame d’Espanet and Madame Haffner, addressed at one moment, in unctuous tones, as ‘My dear colleague’, and at another as ‘Our great administrator’. Next came the politicians: Monsieur Hupel de la Noue, a provincial prefect who spent eight months of the year in Paris; three deputies, among whom Monsieur Haffner displayed his wide Alsatian face; then Monsieur de Saffré, a charming young man, secretary to one of the ministers; and Monsieur Michelin, the First Commissioner of Public Highways. Monsieur de Mareuil, a perpetual candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, sat square, facing the Prefect, at whom he constantly made sheep’s eyes. As to Monsieur d’Espanet, he never accompanied his wife on social occasions. The ladies of the family were placed between the most prominent of these personages. Saccard had, however, kept his sister Sidonie, whom he had placed further off, for the seat between the two contractors, Charrier on her right, Mignon on her left, as being a position of trust in the process of conquest. Madame Michelin, the wife of the First Commissioner, a plump, pretty, dark-haired woman, sat next to Monsieur de Saffré, with whom she carried on an animated conversation in a low voice. At either side of the table were the young people, auditors to the Council of State,* sons of powerful fathers, budding millionaires, Monsieur de Mussy casting despairing glances at Renée, and Maxime, apparently quite charmed by Louise de Mareuil, who sat on his right. Little by little they had begun to laugh very loudly. It was their end of the table that produced the first outbursts of gaiety."
"Ils mirent leur luxe sur la façade et ouvrirent les rideaux, les jours de grands dîners. Le coup de vent de la vie contemporaine, qui avait fait battre les portes du premier étage de la rue de Rivoli, était devenu, dans l’hôtel, un véritable ouragan qui menaçait d’emporter les cloisons. Au milieu de ces appartements princiers, le long des rampes dorées, sur les tapis de haute laine, dans ce palais féerique de parvenu, l’odeur de Mabille traînait, les déhanchements des quadrilles à la mode dansaient, toute l’époque passait avec son rire fou et bête, son éternelle faim et son éternelle soif. C’était la maison suspecte du plaisir mondain, du plaisir impudent qui élargit les fenêtres pour mettre les passants dans la confidence des alcôves. Le mari et la femme y vivaient librement, sous les yeux de leurs domestiques. Ils s’étaient partagé la maison, ils y campaient, n’ayant pas l’air d’être chez eux, comme jetés, au bout d’un voyage tumultueux et étourdissant, dans quelque royal hôtel garni, où ils n’avaient pris que le temps de défaire leurs malles, pour courir plus vite aux jouissances d’une ville nouvelle. Ils y logeaient à la nuit, ne restant chez eux que les jours de grands dîners, emportés par une course continuelle à travers Paris, rentrant parfois pour une heure, comme on rentre dans une chambre d’auberge, entre deux excursions. Renée s’y sentait plus inquiète, plus nerveuse ; ses jupes de soie glissaient avec des sifflements de couleuvre sur les épais tapis, le long du satin des causeuses ; elle était irritée par ces dorures imbéciles qui l’entouraient, par ces hauts plafonds vides où ne restaient, après les nuits de fête, que les rires des jeunes sots et les sentences des vieux fripons ; et elle eût voulu, pour remplir ce luxe, pour habiter ce rayonnement, un amusement suprême que ses curiosités cherchaient en vain dans tous les coins de l’hôtel, dans le petit salon couleur de soleil, dans la serre aux végétations grasses. Quant à Saccard, il touchait à son rêve ; il recevait la haute finance, M. Toutin-Laroche, M. de Lauwerens ; il recevait aussi les grands politiques, le baron Gouraud, le député Haffner ; son frère, le ministre, avait même bien voulu venir deux ou trois fois consolider sa situation par sa présence.","They put their luxury on the facade and opened the curtains on days of big dinners. The gust of contemporary life, which had caused the doors of the first floor in the rue de Rivoli to bang, had become, in the hotel, a veritable hurricane which threatened to sweep away the partitions. In the middle of these princely apartments, along the gilded banisters, on the high woolen carpets, in this magical upstart palace, the smell of Mabille lingered, the swaying hips of the fashionable quadrilles danced, the whole era passed with its crazy and stupid laughter, his eternal hunger and his eternal thirst. It was the suspect house of worldly pleasure, of impudent pleasure which widens the windows to put passers-by in the confidence of the alcoves. Husband and wife lived there freely, under the eyes of their servants. They had shared the house, they camped there, not seeming to be at home, as if thrown, at the end of a tumultuous and dizzying journey, into some royal furnished hotel, where they had not taken only time to unpack their trunks, to run more quickly to the pleasures of a new city. They lodged there by the night, staying at home only on the days of great dinners, carried away by a continual race through Paris, sometimes returning for an hour, as one returns to a room in an inn, between two excursions. Renée felt more worried, more nervous there; her silk skirts slid with the hiss of a snake over the thick rugs, along the satin of the loveseats; she was irritated by the imbecile gilding that surrounded her, by those high empty ceilings where, after nights of celebration, nothing remained but the laughter of young fools and the sentences of old rogues; and she would have liked, to fulfill this luxury, to inhabit this radiance, a supreme amusement which her curiosity sought in vain in every corner of the hotel, in the little sun-colored salon, in the greenhouse with its lush vegetation. As for Saccard, he was nearing his dream; he received high finance, M. Toutin-Laroche, M. de Lauwerens; he also received the great politicians, Baron Gouraud, the deputy Haffner; his brother, the minister, had even been good enough to come two or three times to consolidate his position by his presence.","They displayed their luxury on the façade of their house and opened the curtains when they gave great dinners. The fresh breezes of contemporary life, which had rattled the doors of the second-floor flat on the rue de Rivoli, had by now reached the intensity of a genuine hurricane, which threatened to blow down the walls. Amid these princely apartments, along the gilded banisters, upon the thick wool carpets in this fantastic parvenu’s palace, the smell of Mabille lingered; hips were provocatively thrust about as in the fashionable quadrilles of the moment; and the whole era passed by with its mad and foolish laughter, its eternal hunger and eternal thirst. It was a dubious house of worldly pleasure, of impudent ecstasy that enlarged the windows the better to share the secrets of the alcoves with passersby. Here, husband and wife lived lives free of restraint before the eyes of their servants. They divided up the house and camped out in it, appearing to be not in their own home but as if cast ashore at the end of a tumultuous and dizzying voyage, living in a regal hotel, rushing out without even taking the time to unpack their bags so as to savor the pleasures of a new city as quickly as possible. They lodged there by the night, staying home in the evening only when there was a banquet and otherwise perpetually caught up in the whirlwind round of Parisian society, occasionally returning home for an hour as a traveler might return to a room in an inn between two excursions. Renée felt more anxious there, more nervous. Her silk skirts glided with a snakelike hiss over the thick carpets and along the satin upholstery of the love seats. She was irritated by the stupid gilding all around her, by the high, empty ceilings beneath which nothing remained after a festive evening except the laughter of the young fools and the sententious pronouncements of the old scoundrels. To fill this sumptuous space, to inhabit these radiant premises, she would have liked to find some supreme amusement, for which she avidly searched high and low throughout the mansion, from the small sun-colored salon to the conservatory with its thick vegetation, but to no avail. Saccard, meanwhile, realized his dream: he played host to the world of high finance, to MM Toutin-Laroche and de Lauwerens; he also received leading politicians such as Baron Gouraud and Haffner, the deputy; even his brother the minister had been kind enough to come two or three times to shore up Saccard’s situation with his presence.","They emblazoned their luxury on the walls, and drew back the curtains when they gave big dinner-parties. The whirlwind of contemporary life, which had made the doors on the first floor in the Rue de Rivoli constantly slam, had become an absolute hurricane which threatened to blow away the partitions. In the midst of these princely rooms, along the gilded balustrades, over the fine velvet carpets, in this fairy parvenu palace, there trailed the aroma of Mabille, there danced jaunty popular quadrilles, the whole period passed by with its mad, stupid laughter, its eternal hunger, and its eternal thirst. It was a disorderly house of pleasure, the brash pleasure that enlarges the windows so that the passers-by can share the secrets of the alcoves. The husband and wife lived there freely, under their servants’ eyes. They divided the house into two, camping there, as if they had been dropped, at the end of a tumultuous journey, into some palatial hotel where they had simply unpacked their trunks before rushing out to taste the delights of a new city. They slept there at night, staying at home only on the days of their great dinner-parties, carried away by constant trips across Paris, returning sometimes for an hour as one returns to a room at an inn between excursions. Renée felt restless and nervous there; her silk skirts glided with snakelike hisses over the thick carpets, along the satin of the couches; she was irritated by the idiotic gilding that surrounded her, by the high, empty ceilings, where after nights of festivity there lingered nothing but the laughter of young fools and the sententious maxims of old rogues; and to fill this luxury, to live amid this splendour, she longed for a supreme form of pleasure, which she sought vainly in all corners of the house, in the little sun-coloured drawing room, and in the hothouse with its lush vegetation. As for Saccard, he was realizing his dream: he received representatives of high finance: Monsieur Toutin-Laroche and Monsieur de Lauwerens; he received great politicians, Baron Gouraud and Haffner the deputy; his brother the minister had even agreed to come two or three times and consolidate Saccard’s position by his presence."

"Quand le lac et les petits bois, évanouis dans l’ombre, ne furent plus, au ras du ciel, qu’une barre noire, la jeune femme se retourna brusquement, et, d’une voix où il y avait des larmes de dépit, elle reprit sa phrase interrompue :","When the lake and the little woods, vanished in the shadows, were nothing more, level with the sky, than a black bar, the young woman turned abruptly, and, in a voice in which there were tears of annoyance, , she resumed her interrupted sentence:","When the lake and the little woods, vanished into darkness, were reduced to no more than a black streak on the face of heaven, the young woman turned abruptly and in a voice marked by tears of spite took up where she had left off.","When, fading into the shadows, the lake and bushes showed only as a black bar against the sky, Renée turned round abruptly and, in an annoyed tone, resumed her interrupted sentence:"

"Le dossier avait déjà disparu dans les vastes poches de M. Toutin-Laroche. La commission dut s’incliner. Sur le quai, comme ils sortaient, les deux compères se regardèrent sans rire.

Standing at a respectful distance from Saccard, he calmly examined the financier out of the corner of his eye. Larsonneau, who addressed this man as Baptistin, subjected him to an interrogation, to which he responded in monosyllables, showing no sign of becoming rattled. He withstood this grilling without flinching even though his employer felt compelled to accompany each of his questions with epithets such as thief, crook, and scoundrel.","Not ten minutes later a short young man with a squint, fair hair, and a freckled face slipped in, taking care that the door should not make a noise.

"Quand elle connut l’histoire, elle imposa presque son frère, dont la femme agonisait.

La première entrevue de la tante et de Saccard eut lieu dans l’entresol de la rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière. L’employé, qui était arrivé par la porte cochère de la rue Papillon, comprit, en voyant venir Mme Aubertot par la boutique et le petit escalier, le mécanisme ingénieux des deux entrées. Il fut plein de tact et de convenance. Il traita le mariage comme une affaire, mais en homme du monde qui réglerait ses dettes de jeu. La tante Élisabeth était beaucoup plus frissonnante que lui ; elle balbutiait, elle n’osait parler des cent mille francs qu’elle avait promis.","When she heard the story, she almost taxed her brother, whose wife was dying.

The clerk, who had arrived by the porte-cochere of the rue Papillon, understood, on seeing Madame Aubertot coming through the shop and the little staircase, the ingenious mechanism of the two entrances. He was full of tact and propriety. He treated the marriage as a business, but as a man of the world who would settle his gambling debts. Aunt Elizabeth was much more shivering than he; she stammered, she dared not speak of the hundred thousand francs she had promised.","When she learned of the story, she all but forced her brother on the unfortunate family even as his wife lay dying.

The aunt’s first interview with Saccard took place in the apartment on the rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière. The city-hall employee, who had come in through the carriage entrance on the rue Papillon, saw Mme Aubertot enter by way of the shop and the hidden staircase and immediately grasped the ingenious contrivance of the two entrances. He was as tactful and polite as could be. He treated the marriage as a business deal, but with the attitude of a man of the world settling a gambling debt. Aunt Elisabeth trembled a good deal more than he. She stammered and did not dare mention the hundred thousand francs she had promised him.","Once she knew the story, she almost forced her brother, whose wife lay dying, upon them.

"Leurs confidences, leurs bavardages de bons camarades recommencèrent. Maxime avait allumé un cigare. Renée buvait son café à petits coups et se permettait même un verre de chartreuse. La pièce s’échauffait, s’emplissait d’une fumée bleuâtre. Elle finit par mettre les coudes sur la table et par appuyer son menton entre ses deux poings à demi fermés. Dans cette légère étreinte, sa bouche se rapetissait, ses joues remontaient un peu, et ses yeux, plus minces, luisaient davantage. Ainsi chiffonnée, sa petite figure était adorable, sous la pluie de frisons dorés qui lui descendaient maintenant jusque dans les sourcils. Maxime la regardait à travers la fumée de son cigare. Il la trouvait originale. Par moments, il n’était plus bien sûr de son sexe ; la grande ride qui lui traversait le front, l’avancement boudeur de ses lèvres, son air indécis de myope, en faisaient un grand jeune homme ; d’autant plus que sa longue blouse de satin noir allait si haut, qu’on voyait à peine, sous le menton, une ligne du cou blanche et grasse. Elle se laissait regarder avec un sourire, ne bougeant plus la tête, le regard perdu, la parole ralentie.","Their confidences, their chatter of good comrades began again. Maxime had lit a cigar. Renée drank her coffee in small sips and even allowed herself a glass of chartreuse. The room was heating up, filling with bluish smoke. She ends up putting her elbows on the table and leaning her chin between her two half-closed fists. In this light embrace, her mouth shrank, her cheeks rose a little, and her eyes, thinner, shone more. Thus crumpled, her little face was adorable, under the shower of golden curls which now descended to her eyebrows. Maxime looked at her through the smoke of his cigar. He found it original. At times he was no longer quite sure of his sex; the great wrinkle that crossed his forehead, the sulky protrusion of his lips, his undecided, myopic air, made him a tall young man; especially since her long black satin blouse went so high that you could barely see a line of the white, greasy neck below her chin. She let herself be looked at with a smile, no longer moving her head, her gaze lost, her speech slowed down.","They went back to sharing confidences and gossiping like old comrades. Maxime lit a cigar. Renée sipped her coffee and even allowed herself a glass of chartreuse. The room heated up and filled with bluish smoke. After a while she placed her elbows on the table and propped her chin on two half-clenched fists. Under this slight pressure her mouth grew smaller, her cheeks were lifted up a bit, and her eyes, narrowed somewhat, glowed more brightly. Distorted in this way, her small face looked lovely under the shower of golden curls that now dangled down to her eyebrows. Maxime stared at her through the smoke from his cigar. She was definitely an original. At times he was no longer quite sure of her sex. The large wrinkle across her forehead, the pouting protrusion of her lips, and the vagueness in her eyes because of her nearsightedness made her look like a nearly grown young man, particularly since her long black satin blouse went so high that a line of fleshy white neck was barely visible beneath her chin. She submitted to his stare with a smile, holding her head steady, staring vacantly, and keeping her lips sealed.","They resumed their intimate conversation. Maxime had lit a cigar. Renée sipped her coffee and even indulged in a glass of chartreuse. The room grew warmer and became filled with blue smoke. She ended by leaning her elbows on the table and resting her chin between her half-closed fists.

Her rumpled little face looked adorable under the rain of golden curls that fell down over her eyebrows. Maxime looked at her through his cigar smoke. He thought her quaint. At times he was no longer quite sure of her sex: the line on her forehead, her pouting lips, the look of slight uncertainty caused by her shortsightedness, made her almost like a young man, the more so as her long black satin blouse came up so high that one could barely see, under her chin, a line of plump white neck. She let herself be looked at, smiling, her head motionless, her eyes vacant, her lips still."

"Quand ils rentraient, ils rapportaient du dehors, dans leurs habits, un peu des filles qu’ils quittaient.

"Dans la voiture, ils éprouvèrent une gêne horrible. Ils s’étaient placés, comme en descendant du parc Monceau, l’un en face de l’autre. Ils ne trouvaient pas une parole à se dire. Le fiacre était plein d’une ombre opaque, et le cigare de Maxime n’y mettait plus même un point rouge, un éclair de braise rose. Le jeune homme perdu de nouveau dans les jupons, « dont il avait jusqu’aux yeux », souffrait de ces ténèbres, de ce silence, de cette femme muette, qu’il sentait à son côté, et dont il s’imaginait voir les yeux tout grands ouverts sur la nuit.

So as to seem less stupid, he finally sought her hand, and when he held it in his own he felt relieved and found the situation tolerable. That hand surrendered itself to him, soft and as if in a dream.","In the cab they felt terribly awkward. They sat facing each other, as when they drove down from the Parc Monceau.

"Un seul homme, Baptiste, le valet de chambre de son mari, continuait à l’inquiéter.

Alors il se pencha pour prendre Clotilde entre ses bras et l’emporter dans l’autre chambre. Elle le lui défendit encore, d’un mouvement de lèvres. Elle exigeait qu’il restât là. Elle s’éteignit doucement, sans le quitter du regard, et à mesure qu’il pâlissait, ce regard prenait plus de douceur. Elle pardonna au dernier soupir. Elle mourut comme elle avait vécu, mollement, s’effaçant dans la mort, après s’être effacée dans la vie. Saccard demeura frissonnant devant ces yeux de morte, restés ouverts, et qui continuaient à le poursuivre dans leur immobilité. La petite Clotilde berçait sa poupée sur un bord du drap, doucement, pour ne pas réveiller sa mère.","Saccard, pursued by that look of a dying woman, in which he read such a long reproach, leaned against the furniture, sought out shady corners. Then, fainting, he wanted to drive away this nightmare which was driving him mad, he advanced into the light of the lamp. But Angèle made a sign to him not to speak. And she was still gazing at him with that air of terrified anguish, now mingled with a promise of forgiveness. Then he bent down to take Clotilde in his arms and carry her into the other room. She again forbade him, with a movement of her lips. She demanded that he stay there. She died slowly, without taking her gaze from him, and as he grew paler, her gaze took on a softer look. She forgave at the last breath. She died as she had lived, softly, fading away in death, after having faded away in life. Saccard remained shivering before those dead eyes, which remained open and which continued to pursue him in their immobility. Little Clotilde rocked her doll gently on the edge of the sheet, so as not to wake her mother.","Saccard, pursued by the dying woman’s stare, which he read as a reproach, leaned against the furniture and groped for the shadows. Then, feeling faint, he sought to banish the nightmare that was driving him mad and advanced into the light. But Angèle motioned to him not to speak. She continued to stare at him with a look of terrified anguish, now mixed with a promise of forgiveness. At that point he bent down to take Clotilde in his arms and carry her into the other room. With a movement of her lips Angèle stopped him from doing this as well. She insisted that he remain with her. She went gently, without taking her eyes off him, and the paler he grew, the gentler her gaze became. Forgiveness came with her final sigh. She died as she had lived, softly, diffident in death as she had been in life. Saccard stood trembling before those lifeless eyes, which remained open and, inert though they now were, continued to pursue him. Little Clotilde rocked her doll gently on the edge of the sheet so as not to wake her mother.","Saccard, followed by the dying woman’s gaze, in which he read such deep reproachfulness, leant against the furniture for support, sought the dark corners of the room. Then, faltering, he made as if to drive away the nightmare that was tormenting him, and stepped forward into the light of the lamp. But Angèle signed to him not to speak and continued to stare at him with her look of terror-stricken anguish, to which was now added a promise of forgiveness. Then he bent down to take Clotilde in his arms and carry her into the other room. She forbade him this too, with a movement of her lips. She insisted that he should stay there. She expired gently, without taking her eyes off him, and as her sight dimmed her gaze became more and more gentle. With her last breath she forgave him. She died as she had lived, discreetly, self-effacing in death as in life. Saccard stood trembling before her lifeless eyes, still open, which continued to watch him. Little Clotilde nursed her doll on the edge of the sheets, gently, so as not to awaken her mother."
"Elle était folle un mois, s’affichait avec son cher seigneur dans tout Paris ; puis, un matin, au milieu du tapage de sa tendresse, elle sentait un silence écrasant, un vide immense. Le premier, le jeune duc de Rozan, ne fut guère qu’un déjeuner de soleil ; Renée, qui l’avait remarqué pour sa douceur et sa tenue excellente, le trouva en tête-à-tête absolument nul, déteint, assommant. M. Simpson, attaché à l’ambassade américaine, qui vint ensuite, faillit la battre, et dut à cela de rester plus d’un an avec elle.","She was mad for a month, displayed herself with her dear lord all over Paris; then, one morning, in the midst of the uproar of her tenderness, she felt a crushing silence, an immense emptiness. The first, the young Duc de Rozan, was little more than a lunch in the sun; Renée, who had noticed him for his softness and his excellent bearing, found him absolutely useless, faded, boring. Mr. Simpson, attached to the American Embassy, who came next, nearly beat her, and was due to that to stay more than a year with her.","One month she was madly in love and showed herself with her lord and master all over Paris. Then, one morning, in the midst of her ostentatious show of affection, she felt an oppressive silence, an immense void. Her first lover, the young duc de Rozan, was little more than a quick snack in the sun. Renée, who had picked him out for his gentle manner and excellent attire, found him, once they were alone together, absolutely empty, colorless, and tiresome. Next came Mr. Simpson, an attaché at the American embassy, who practically beat her and for that reason remained with her for more than a year.","She went mad for a month, exhibiting herself with her lord and master all over Paris; then one morning, amid the tumult of her passion, she became aware of a great silence, an immense void. The first, the young Duc de Rozan, was a feast of sunshine that led to nothing; Renée, who had noticed him because of his gentleness and his excellent manners, found him utterly dull and shallow when they were alone together. Mr Simpson, an attaché at the American Embassy, who came next, all but beat her, and thanks to this remained with her for more than a year."
"— Ah ! bien, ce serait trop bête de nous gêner, maintenant… Tu ne sais donc pas que, depuis hier, depuis que tu as voulu rompre, je n’ai plus la tête à moi. Je suis comme une imbécile. Ce soir, au bal, j’avais un brouillard devant les yeux. C’est qu’à présent, j’ai besoin de toi pour vivre. Quand tu t’en iras, je serai vidée… Ne ris pas, je te dis ce que je sens.","- Ah! well, it would be too stupid to get in our way now... So you don't know that since yesterday, since you wanted to break up, I've lost my mind. I'm like a fool. Tonight, at the ball, I had a mist before my eyes. It is that now, I need you to live. When you go, I'll be empty... Don't laugh, I'm telling you what I feel.","You have no idea, do you? that since yesterday when you tried to break off with me, I’ve been out of my mind.

I feel half mad. At the ball this evening I could hardly see. The fact is I can’t live without you. Don’t laugh, I mean it.’"
"Puis elle ajouta, avec sa moue de dédain, comme se souvenant :","Then she added, with her pout of disdain, as if remembering:","Then, as if remembering, she added with her disdainful pout, “Oh, yes, of course, that fat cow Laure!","Then she added, with a pout of contempt, as if remembering:"

"Saccard, tout frais de sa province, ne put d’abord descendre dans les profondeurs délicates des nombreux métiers de Mme Sidonie. Comme il avait fait une année de droit, elle lui parla un jour des trois milliards, d’un air grave, ce qui lui donna une pauvre idée de son intelligence. Elle vint fouiller les coins du logement de la rue Saint-Jacques, pesa Angèle d’un regard, et ne reparut que lorsque ses courses l’appelaient dans le quartier, et qu’elle éprouvait le besoin de remettre les trois milliards sur le tapis. Angèle avait mordu à l’histoire de la dette anglaise. La courtière enfourchait son dada, faisait ruisseler l’or pendant une heure. C’était la fêlure, dans cet esprit délié, la folie douce dont elle berçait sa vie perdue en misérables trafics, l’appât magique dont elle grisait avec elle les plus crédules de ses clientes. Très convaincue, du reste, elle finissait par parler des trois milliards comme d’une fortune personnelle, dans laquelle il faudrait bien que les juges la fissent rentrer tôt ou tard, ce qui jetait une merveilleuse auréole autour de son pauvre chapeau noir, où se balançaient quelques violettes pâlies à des tiges de laiton dont on voyait le métal. Angèle ouvrait des yeux énormes. À plusieurs reprises, elle parla avec respect de sa belle-sœur à son mari, disant que Mme Sidonie les enrichirait peut-être un jour. Saccard haussait les épaules ; il était allé visiter la boutique et l’entresol du Faubourg-Poissonnière, et n’y avait flairé qu’une faillite prochaine. Il voulut connaître l’opinion d’Eugène sur leur sœur ; mais celui-ci devint grave et se contenta de répondre qu’il ne la voyait jamais, qu’il la savait fort intelligente, un peu compromettante peut-être. Cependant, comme Saccard revenait rue de Penthièvre, quelque temps après, il crut voir la robe noire de Mme Sidonie sortir de chez son frère et filer rapidement le long des maisons. Il courut, mais il ne put retrouver la robe noire. La courtière avait une de ces tournures effacées qui se perdent dans la foule. Il resta songeur, et ce fut à partir de ce moment qu’il étudia sa sœur avec plus d’attention. Il ne tarda pas à pénétrer le labeur immense de ce petit être pâle et vague, dont la face entière semblait loucher et se fondre. Il eut du respect pour elle. Elle était bien du sang des Rougon.","Saccard, fresh from his province, could not at first descend into the delicate depths of Madame Sidonie's many trades. As he had done a year of law school, she spoke to him one day about the three billion, with a serious air, which gave him a poor idea of his intelligence. She came to search the corners of the apartment in the rue Saint-Jacques, weighed Angèle with a glance, and only reappeared when her shopping called her to the neighborhood, and she felt the need to put the three billion on the carpet. . Angèle had taken a bite out of the story of the English debt. The broker straddled her hobbies, making the gold trickle down for an hour. It was the crack, in this loose spirit, the sweet madness with which she cradled her life lost in miserable traffic, the magic bait with which she intoxicated the most credulous of her clients. Very convinced, moreover, she ended up talking about the three billion as a personal fortune, into which the judges would have to make her return sooner or later, which cast a marvelous halo around her poor black hat, where swung a few pale violets from brass rods whose metal you could see. Angèle opened her huge eyes. On several occasions she spoke respectfully of her sister-in-law to her husband, saying that Madame Sidonie might one day enrich them. Saccard shrugged his shoulders; he had gone to visit the shop and the entresol of the Faubourg-Poissonnière, and had smelled nothing but approaching bankruptcy. He wanted to know Eugene's opinion of their sister; but the latter became serious and contented himself with replying that he never saw her, that he knew she was very intelligent, perhaps a little compromising. However, as Saccard was returning to the rue de Penthièvre some time later, he thought he saw Madame Sidonie's black dress coming out of her brother's and rapidly passing by the houses. He ran, but he couldn't find the black robe. The broker had one of those self-effacing expressions which get lost in a crowd. He remained thoughtful, and it was from then on that he studied his sister with more attention. He was not long in penetrating the immense labor of this small, pale and vague being, whose whole face seemed to squint and melt. He had respect for her. She was of Rougon blood.","Saccard, newly arrived from his province, could not at first fathom the intricate depths of Mme Sidonie’s numerous occupations. Since he had done a year of law, she spoke to him one day about the three billion francs with an air of seriousness that left him with a poor opinion of her intelligence. She gave the apartment on the rue Saint-Jacques the once over, took Angèle’s measure at a glance, and did not reappear until her errands brought her back to the neighborhood and she felt a need to allude once more to the matter of the three billion francs. Angèle had been hooked by the story of the English debt. The saleswoman mounted her hobbyhorse and for an hour made the heavens rain with gold. This was the crack in her nimble mind, the tempting folly with which she compensated for a life squandered in squalid deals, the magical bait with which she bewitched not only herself but the most credulous of her clients. She was so convinced of her case, moreover, that she ended up speaking of the three billion as her own personal fortune, which sooner or later the judges must restore to its rightful owner. Her miserable black hat, garnished with faded violets swaying on stems of bare brass wire, was thus wreathed in a miraculous aureole. Angèle’s enormous eyes opened wide. On several occasions she spoke of her sister-in-law to her husband with respect, saying that Mme Sidonie might one day make them rich. Saccard shrugged. He had visited the boutique and the apartment on the rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière and had sniffed nothing but impending bankruptcy. He asked his brother’s opinion of their sister, but Eugène turned grave and replied only that he never saw her and knew her to be highly intelligent but perhaps a little disreputable. Some time later, however, as Saccard was returning to the rue de Penthièvre, he thought he saw Mme Sidonie’s black dress slip out of his brother’s apartment and scurry down the street. He ran after the woman in black but lost sight of her. The businesswoman’s appearance was of the unremarkable sort that is easily lost in a crowd. But the incident made an impression on him, and from that moment on he began to study his sister more carefully. It did not take him long to grasp the immensity of the labor performed by this pale, shapeless little woman, whose whole face seemed to melt into a covetous gaze. He respected her. She had the Rougon blood in her veins.","Saccard, fresh from the country, was unable at first to fathom the depths of Madame Sidonie’s numerous trades. As he had read law for a year, she spoke to him one day of the three thousand million with an air of seriousness that gave him a poor opinion of her intellect. She came and rummaged in the corners of the lodgings in the Rue Saint-Jacques, summed up Angèle with a glance, and did not return until her errands brought her to the neighbourhood and she felt a desire to discuss the question of the money. Angèle had nibbled at the story of the English debt. The agent mounted her hobbyhorse, and made the gold rain down for an hour. It was the crack in this quick intelligence, the sweet mad lullaby of a life wasted in squalid dealings, the magical charm with which she captivated not only herself but the more credulous among her clients. Firm in her conviction, she ended by speaking of the three thousand million as of a personal fortune which the judges were bound sooner or later to restore to her; and this threw a wondrous halo round her poor black bonnet, which bore a few faded violets on brass wire whose metal showed through. Angèle opened her eyes wide. She often spoke with respect of her sister-in-law to her husband, saying that perhaps Madame Sidonie would make them rich one day. Saccard shrugged; he had been to the shop and entresol in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, and had felt that there was nothing there but imminent bankruptcy. He asked Eugène’s opinion of their sister; but his brother became serious and simply replied that he never saw her, that he knew her to be a very intelligent woman, though somewhat dangerous perhaps. Nevertheless, as Saccard was returning to the Rue Penthièvre some time afterwards, he thought he saw Madame Sidonie’s black dress leave his brother’s and glide rapidly along the houses. He ran after it, but was unable to catch sight again of the black dress. The female agent had one of those slight figures that get lost in a crowd. He stood pondering, and from this moment he began to study his sister more attentively. It was not long before he grasped the scale of the work performed by this pale, nebulous little creature whose whole face seemed to melt away and become shapeless. He respected her. She was a true Rougon."

"Elle était en effet plus jaune que de coutume, dans sa robe de magicienne semée d’étoiles. Et, comme Mme Michelin ne l’écoutait pas, elle continua à voix plus basse, murmurant que l’Angleterre ne pouvait avoir payé, et que décidément elle irait à Londres elle-même.","She was indeed more yellow than usual, in her star-strewn magician dress. And, as Madame Michelin did not listen to her, she continued in a lower voice, murmuring that England could not have paid, and that she would definitely go to London herself.","Indeed, she did look more waxen than usual in her star-studded magician’s gown. Since Mme Michelin was paying no attention to her, she lowered her voice even more and muttered to herself that it was impossible that England had paid and therefore there was no choice but for her to go to London herself.","She was yellower than usual, in her sorceress’s robe spangled with stars.

"Renée ne l’écoutait pas. Elle entra dans le grand salon, elle traversa une figure très compliquée du cotillon, sans même voir la surprise que causait sa pelisse de fourrure.

"Deux fois, il alla chez son frère, pour activer ses démarches. Eugène l’accueillit avec brusquerie, lui répétant qu’il ne l’oubliait pas, mais qu’il fallait attendre.","Twice he went to his brother, to speed up his steps. Eugene greeted him abruptly, repeating to him that he had not forgotten him, but that he must wait.",Twice he called on his brother to urge him to press his inquiries a little harder. Eugène greeted him brusquely and repeated that he had not forgotten his promise but that it would be necessary to wait.,"Twice he called on his brother to urge him to greater effort on his behalf. Eugène received him gruffly, told him that he was not forgetting him, that he must be patient."
"Saccard ne pouvait garder longtemps dans son voisinage une chose ou une personne, sans vouloir la vendre, en tirer un profit quelconque. Son fils n’avait pas vingt ans, qu’il songea à l’utiliser. Un joli garçon, neveu d’un ministre, fils d’un grand financier, devait être d’un bon placement. Il était bien un peu jeune, mais on pouvait toujours lui chercher une femme et une dot, quitte à traîner le mariage en longueur, ou à le précipiter, selon les embarras d’argent de la maison. Il eut la main heureuse. Il trouva, dans un conseil de surveillance dont il faisait partie, un grand bel homme, M. de Mareuil, qui, en deux jours, lui appartint. M. de Mareuil était un ancien raffineur du Havre, du nom de Bonnet. Après avoir amassé une grosse fortune, il avait épousé une jeune fille noble, fort riche également, qui cherchait un imbécile de grande mine. Bonnet obtint de prendre le nom de sa femme, ce qui fut pour lui une première satisfaction d’orgueil ; mais son mariage lui avait donné une ambition folle, il rêvait de payer Hélène de sa noblesse en acquérant une haute situation politique. Dès ce moment, il mit de l’argent dans les nouveaux journaux, il acheta au fond de la Nièvre de grandes propriétés, il se prépara par tous les moyens connus une candidature au Corps législatif. Jusque-là, il avait échoué, sans rien perdre de sa solennité. C’était le cerveau le plus incroyablement vide qu’on pût rencontrer. Il avait une carrure superbe, la face blanche et pensive d’un grand homme d’État ; et, comme il écoutait d’une façon merveilleuse, avec des regards profonds, un calme majestueux du visage, on pouvait croire à un prodigieux travail intérieur de compréhension et de déduction. Sûrement, il ne pensait à rien. Mais il arrivait à troubler les gens, qui ne savaient plus s’ils avaient affaire à un homme supérieur ou à un imbécile. M. de Mareuil s’attacha à Saccard comme à sa planche de salut. Il savait qu’une candidature officielle allait être libre dans la Nièvre, il souhaitait ardemment que le ministre le désignât ; c’était son dernier coup de carte. Aussi se livra-t-il pieds et poings liés au frère du ministre. Saccard, qui flaira une bonne affaire, le poussa à l’idée d’un mariage entre sa fille Louise et Maxime. L’autre se répandit en effusion, crut avoir trouvé le premier cette idée de mariage, s’estima fort heureux d’entrer dans la famille d’un ministre, et de donner Louise à un jeune homme qui paraissait avoir les plus belles espérances.","Saccard could not keep a thing or a person in his vicinity for long without wanting to sell it, to derive some profit from it. His son was not yet twenty when he thought of using it. A pretty boy, nephew of a minister, son of a great financier, must have been a good investment. He was indeed a little young, but a wife and a dowry could always be found for him, even if it meant dragging out the marriage, or rushing it, according to the financial difficulties of the household. He had a happy hand. He found, in a board of supervisors of which he was a member, a tall, handsome man, M. de Mareuil, who, in two days, belonged to him. M. de Mareuil was a former refiner from Le Havre, by the name of Bonnet. After having amassed a large fortune, he had married a noble girl, also very rich, who was looking for a great-looking imbecile. Bonnet obtained permission to take his wife's name, which gave him a first satisfaction of pride; but his marriage had given him mad ambition, he dreamed of repaying Hélène for his nobility by acquiring a high political position. From that moment, he put money into the new newspapers, he bought large estates deep in the Nièvre, he prepared himself by all known means for a candidacy for the Legislative Body. Until then, it had failed, without losing any of its solemnity. He was the most incredibly empty brain one could meet. He had a superb build, the pensive white face of a great statesman; and, as he listened in a marvelous way, with deep looks, a majestic calm of the face, one could believe in a prodigious interior work of comprehension and deduction. Surely he was thinking of nothing. But he managed to confuse people, who no longer knew whether they were dealing with a superior man or an imbecile. M. de Mareuil clung to Saccard as his lifeline. He knew that an official candidacy was going to be free in the Nièvre, he ardently hoped that the minister would appoint him; it was his last stroke of the card. So he gave himself up bound hand and foot to the minister's brother. Saccard, who smelled a good deal, pushed him to the idea of a marriage between his daughter Louise and Maxime. The other burst into effusion, thought he had been the first to find this idea of marriage, considered himself very happy to enter into the family of a minister, and to give Louise to a young man who seemed to have the brightest hopes.","Saccard could not keep anything or anyone close to him for long without wanting to sell or derive a profit from it. Before his son was twenty it occurred to him that the boy could be useful. A good-looking young man who was the nephew of a minister and the son of an important financier was bound to be a good investment. He was of course a bit young, but one could always search out a wife and dowry for him, and then the wedding could be postponed or hurried along according to the financial needs of the firm. Saccard chose well. At a meeting of a board of directors of which he was a member, he chanced to meet a tall, handsome man by the name of Mareuil, and within two days Mareuil was his. M. de Mareuil had once been a sugar refiner in Le Havre, at which time his name had been Bonnet. After amassing a large fortune, he had married a young noblewoman, also quite wealthy, who had been looking for an imbecile with an impressive face. His first proud trophy was the right to use his wife’s name, but the marriage had made him insanely ambitious: he dreamed of paying Hélène back for her nobility by acquiring a high political position. He immediately invested money in the new newspapers, bought extensive properties in the remote Nièvre, and did all he could to prepare himself to run for a seat in the legislature. Thus far he had failed, though without shedding any of his solemnity. His was the most incredibly empty brain one could possibly encounter. He was a man of superb stature, with the white, pensive face of a great statesman, and since he was a marvelously good listener, with a deep gaze and a majestic calm in his expression, it was possible to believe that he was engaged in a prodigious inner labor of comprehension and deduction. Of course his mind was completely empty. Yet he had a disturbing effect on people, who had no idea whether they were dealing with a superior man or an imbecile. M. de Mareuil clung to Saccard as to a life raft. He knew that an official candidacy was about to open up in the Nièvre and ardently hoped that the minister would designate him. This was the last card he had to play. Hence he put himself completely in the hands of the minister’s brother. Saccard, who sensed a mutually advantageous alliance, encouraged him to think of marrying his daughter Louise off to Maxime. Mareuil was effusive in gratitude, believed that the idea of a wedding had been his own, and considered himself most fortunate to forge an alliance with the family of a minister and to give Louise to a young man whose prospects seemed bright indeed.","Saccard could not be near a thing or a person for long without wanting to sell it or derive some profit from it. His son was not yet twenty when he began to think about how to use him. A good-looking boy, nephew to a minister and son of a prominent financier, ought to be a good investment. He was still a trifle young, but it was always possible to find a wife and dowry for him and then put the wedding off, or arrange it quickly, according to the demands of domestic economy. Saccard was fortunate. He discovered on a board of directors of which he was a member a tall, handsome man, Monsieur de Mareuil, who was in his pocket within two days. Monsieur de Mareuil was a retired sugar-refiner from Le Havre, and his real name was Bonnet. After making a large fortune, he had married a young girl of noble birth, also very rich, who was on the lookout for a fool of imposing appearance. Bonnet obtained permission to assume his wife’s name, which was a first satisfaction for his bride; but his marriage had made him madly ambitious, and his dream was to repay Hélène for the noble name she had given him by achieving a high political position. From that time onward he put money into new newspapers, bought large estates in the heart of the Nièvre, and by all the usual means made himself a candidate for the Corps Législatif. So far he had failed, but without losing any of his pomposity. He was the most empty-headed individual one could come across. He was of splendid stature, with the white, pensive face of a great statesman; and as he had a marvellous way of listening, with a profound gaze and a majestically calm expression, he gave the impression of a prodigious inner labour of comprehension and deduction. In reality he was thinking of nothing, but he succeeded in perplexing people, who no longer knew whether they were dealing with a man of distinction or a fool. Monsieur de Mareuil attached himself to Saccard as to a raft. He knew that an official candidature was about to fall vacant in the Nièvre, and he fervently hoped that the minister would nominate him: it was his last card. So he handed himself over, bound hand and foot, to the minister’s brother. Saccard, who scented a good piece of business, put into his head a match between his daughter Louise and Maxime. Monsieur de Mareuil became most effusive, imagined he was the first to have thought of this marriage, and considered himself very fortunate to enter into a minister’s family and to give Louise to a young man who seemed to have such fine prospects."
"M. de Mareuil, qui, d’un coup d’œil, avait remercié Saccard d’avoir entamé ce sujet, semblait être sur des charbons ardents. Il rougit légèrement, il fit des saluts embarrassés, lorsque le préfet, s’adressant à lui, continua :","M. de Mareuil, who, with a glance, had thanked Saccard for having broached this subject, seemed to be on hot coals.

"Le silence semblait grandir, les flammes des bougies s’allongeaient, la valse se berçait le long des tentures avec plus de mollesse. Saccard eut un imperceptible mouvement d’épaules. Il regarda encore sa femme et son fils d’un air profond, comme pour arracher à leur visage une explication qu’il ne trouvait pas. Puis il plia lentement l’acte, le mit dans la poche de son habit. Ses joues étaient devenues toutes pâles.","The silence seemed to increase, the flames of the candles lengthened, the waltz rocked along the hangings with more softness.

Her cheeks had turned quite pale.","The silence seemed to deepen, the flames of the candles grew longer, the waltz grew softer as the folds of the draperies wrapped themselves soothingly around it.

Then he slowly folded the document and put it in the pocket of his coat.

"Les premières voitures se dégagèrent et, de proche en proche, toute la file se mit bientôt à rouler doucement. Ce fut comme un réveil. Mille clartés dansantes s’allumèrent, des éclairs rapides se croisèrent dans les roues, des étincelles jaillirent des harnais secoués par les chevaux. Il y eut sur le sol, sur les arbres, de larges reflets de glace qui couraient. Ce pétillement des harnais et des roues, ce flamboiement des panneaux vernis dans lesquels brûlait la braise rouge du soleil couchant, ces notes vives que jetaient les livrées éclatantes perchées en plein ciel et les toilettes riches débordant des portières, se trouvèrent ainsi emportés dans un grondement sourd, continu, rythmé par le trot des attelages. Et le défilé alla, dans les mêmes bruits, dans les mêmes lueurs, sans cesse et d’un seul jet, comme si les premières voitures eussent tiré toutes les autres après elles.","The first cars pulled away and, step by step, the whole line soon began to roll slowly. It was like an awakening. A thousand dancing lights lit up, rapid flashes crossed in the wheels, sparks flew from the harnesses shaken by the horses. There were on the ground, on the trees, large reflections of ice which ran. This crackle of harnesses and wheels, this blaze of varnished panels in which the red embers of the setting sun burned, these lively notes thrown by the dazzling liveries perched in the sky and the rich toilets overflowing from the doors, were thus carried away in a roar muffled, continuous, punctuated by the trot of the teams. And the parade went on, with the same noises, the same lights, unceasingly and in one spurt, as if the first carriages had drawn all the others after them.","The first carriages finally succeeded in extricating themselves, and one by one the whole line slowly began to move. It was like an awakening. A thousand lights began to dance, flashes darted among the wheels, and harnesses glinted as teams strained against their traces. Ground and trees shimmered in what seemed like the glare of moving ice. The glitter of harnesses and wheels, the amber glow of polished panels set ablaze by the setting sun, the shrill accents added by splendid liveries set up high against the open sky and sumptuous finery spilling out over carriage doors—all of this was swept along in a dull rumble, punctuated only by the hoofbeats of trotting horses. The whole parade moved steadily along in a uniform motion, sights and sounds unvarying from first to last, as if the lead carriages were pulling the rest after them.","* The front carriages were finally able to proceed, and one by one the whole line began to move slowly forward. It was like an awakening. A thousand shimmering lights seemed to appear, quick flashes played on the wheels, sparks flew from the horses’ harness.

The glitter of wheels and harness, the blaze of varnished panels glowing with the redness of the setting sun, the bright notes of colour cast by the dazzling liveries perched up full against the sky, and by the rich costumes spilling out through the carriage doors, were accompanied by a continuous, hollow rumbling sound, marked by the rhythmic trot of the horses. The procession continued, with the same effects of light and noise, unceasingly and in a single movement, as if the front carriages were dragging all the others behind them."
"Il était en habit, avec l’écharpe rouge du grand cordon. Renée, reprise par l’émotion, distinguait mal, et cette tache saignante lui semblait éclabousser toute la poitrine du prince. Elle le trouva petit, les jambes trop courtes, les reins flottants ; mais elle était ravie, et elle le voyait beau, avec son visage blême, sa paupière lourde et plombée qui retombait sur son œil mort. Sous ses moustaches, sa bouche s’ouvrait mollement ; tandis que son nez seul restait osseux dans toute sa face dissoute.","He was in a habit, with the red sash of the great cord.

Beneath his whiskers, his mouth opened limply; while his nose alone remained bony throughout his dissolved face.","He was wearing a tailcoat with the red sash of the Grand Cordon. 11 Renée, once more in the grip of emotion, had difficulty seeing clearly, and to her this bloody stain seemed to splatter the prince’s entire chest. She found him small, with legs that were too short and jiggling flesh around his waist. But she was charmed and thought him handsome, with his pale face, and heavy, leaden lids that drooped over lifeless eyes. Underneath his mustache his mouth opened languidly, while the boniness of his nose was the only feature that stood out from his puffy face.","He was in plain dress, with the red ribbon of the Legion of Honour. Renée, again overcome with emotion, could scarcely make out what she saw, and to her this bleeding stain seemed to splash the whole of the sovereign’s breast. She found him quite small, with short legs and swaying hips; but she was utterly charmed, and he seemed handsome, with his wan face and the heavy, leaden lids that fell over his lifeless eyes. Under his moustache his mouth opened feebly; while only his nose stood out from the dissolution of his face."

"Larsonneau s’arrêta net devant Saccard, qui souriait toujours, et le regarda d’un air profond. Puis il reprit sa marche de long en large, mais d’un pas lent et mesuré.

"Quand Maxime eut épousé Louise, et que les jeunes gens furent partis pour l’Italie, elle ne s’inquiéta plus de son amant, elle parut même l’oublier tout à fait. Et quand au bout de six mois, Maxime revint seul, ayant enterré « la bossue » dans le cimetière d’une petite ville de la Lombardie, ce fut de la haine qu’elle montra pour lui. Elle se rappela Phèdre, elle se souvint sans doute de cet amour empoisonné auquel elle avait entendu la Ristori prêter ses sanglots. Alors, pour ne plus rencontrer chez elle le jeune homme, pour creuser à jamais un abîme de honte entre le père et le fils, elle força son mari à connaître l’inceste, elle lui raconta que, le jour où il l’avait surprise avec Maxime, c’était celui-ci qui la poursuivait depuis longtemps, qui cherchait à la violenter. Saccard fut horriblement contrarié de l’insistance qu’elle mit à vouloir lui ouvrir les yeux. Il dut se fâcher avec son fils, cesser de le voir. Le jeune veuf, riche de la dot de sa femme, alla vivre en garçon, dans un petit hôtel de l’avenue de l’Impératrice. Il avait renoncé au conseil d’État, il faisait courir. Renée goûta là une de ses dernières satisfactions. Elle se vengeait, elle jetait à la face de ces deux hommes l’infamie qu’ils avaient mise en elle ; elle se disait que, maintenant, elle ne les verrait plus se moquer d’elle, au bras l’un de l’autre, comme des camarades.","When Maxime had married Louise, and the young people had left for Italy, she no longer troubled herself about her lover, she even seemed to forget him altogether. And when, after six months, Maxime returned alone, having buried ""the hunchback"" in the cemetery of a small town in Lombardy, it was hatred that she showed for him. She remembered Phèdre, she no doubt remembered that poisoned love to which she had heard the Ristori sobbing. So, in order not to meet the young man again at her house, to dig an abyss of shame forever between the father and the son, she forced her husband to experience incest, she told him that, the day he had surprised her with Maxime, it was he who had been pursuing her for a long time, who was trying to violate her. Saccard was horribly annoyed at her insistence on opening his eyes. He had to get angry with his son, stop seeing him. The young widower, rich from his wife's dowry, went to live as a bachelor in a small hotel on the Avenue de l'Impératrice. He had renounced the Council of State, he was running. Renee tasted there one of her last satisfactions. She avenged herself, she threw in the face of these two men the infamy they had placed in her; she told herself that now she would no longer see them making fun of her, in each other's arms, like comrades.","When Maxime married Louise and the young couple left for Italy, Renée stopped worrying about her lover and seemed to forget all about him.

Saccard was terribly vexed by her insistence on opening his eyes. He was obliged to quarrel with his son and refuse to see him. The young widower, wealthy by dint of his wife’s dowry, established bachelor quarters in a small house on the avenue de l’Impératrice. He turned down the Conseil d’Etat and took to racing horses instead. The rupture Renée had caused between father and son was one of her last satisfactions. Her vengeance was to throw the degradation these two men had imposed on her back in their faces. Now, she told herself, she wouldn’t have to watch anymore as they walked arm in arm like two comrades, mocking her.","When Maxime had married Louise, and the young couple left for Italy, she no longer troubled herself about her lover, and even seemed to have forgotten him.

"Tandis que la calèche remontait d’un trot plus vif, Maxime, charmé de l’allure anglaise du paysage, regardait, aux deux côtés de l’avenue, les hôtels, d’architecture capricieuse, dont les pelouses descendent jusqu’aux contre-allées ; Renée, dans sa songerie, s’amusait à voir, au bord de l’horizon, s’allumer un à un les becs de gaz de la place de l’Étoile, et à mesure que ces lueurs vives tachaient le jour mourant de petites flammes jaunes, elle croyait entendre des appels secrets, il lui semblait que le Paris flamboyant des nuits d’hiver s’illuminait pour elle, lui préparait la jouissance inconnue que rêvait son assouvissement.","While the carriage came up at a livelier trot, Maxime, charmed by the English allure of the landscape, gazed on both sides of the avenue at the mansions, of capricious architecture, whose lawns descend to the foothills. aisles; Renée, in her reverie, was amused to see, on the edge of the horizon, the gaslights of the Place de l'Etoile light up one by one, and as these bright lights stained the dying day with small yellow flames, she thought she heard secret calls, it seemed to her that the flamboyant Paris of winter nights was lighting up for her, preparing for her the unknown enjoyment her satisfaction dreamed of.","As the calèche proceeded on its way at a brisker pace than before, Maxime, charmed by the English allure of the landscape, took in the hôtels on both sides of the avenue, town houses of fanciful design whose lawns stretched all the way down to the bridle paths.

Renée, still dreaming , amused herself by watching the gaslamps in the Place de l’Étoile being lit, one by one, on the edge of the horizon, and as each of these bright jets splashed the dying day with its little yellow flame, she seemed to hear mysterious voices; it seemed that Paris was being lit up for her, making ready the unknown pleasure for which her senses yearned."
"Alors Saccard consentit à donner trente mille francs sur les bénéfices futurs de l’affaire de Charonne. Il estimait qu’il se tirait encore à bon marché de la main gantée de l’usurier. Ce dernier fit mettre la promesse à son nom, continuant la comédie jusqu’au bout, disant qu’il tiendrait compte des trente mille francs au jeune homme. Ce fut avec des rires de soulagement que Saccard brûla le registre à la flamme de la cheminée, feuille à feuille. Puis, cette opération terminée, il échangea de vigoureuses poignées de main avec Larsonneau, et le quitta, en lui disant :","Saccard then consented to give thirty thousand francs out of the future profits of the Charonne business. He felt he was still getting off cheap from the gloved hand of the usurer. The latter had the promise put in his name, continuing the comedy to the end, saying that he would take into account the thirty thousand francs to the young man. It was with laughter of relief that Saccard burned the register in the flame of the fireplace, sheet by sheet. Then, this operation finished, he exchanged vigorous handshakes with Larsonneau, and left him, saying to him:","Saccard then agreed to pay 30,000 francs out of the future profits on the Charonne affair.

Saccard chuckled with relief as he burned the ledger in the fireplace, one page at a time. When he was done, he vigorously shook Larsonneau’s hand and left with these parting words: “You’ll be at Laure’s tonight, won’t you? . . .","Saccard agreed to give him thirty thousand francs out of the future profits of the Charonne enterprise.

"Maxime revint chaque nuit. Il arrivait par le jardin, vers une heure. Le plus souvent, Renée l’attendait dans la serre, qu’il devait traverser pour gagner le petit salon. Ils étaient, d’ailleurs, d’une impudence parfaite, se cachant à peine, oubliant les précautions les plus classiques de l’adultère. Ce coin de l’hôtel, il est vrai, leur appartenait. Baptiste, le valet de chambre du mari, avait seul le droit d’y pénétrer, et Baptiste, en homme grave, disparaissait aussitôt que son service était fini. Maxime prétendait même en riant qu’il se retirait pour écrire ses Mémoires. Une nuit, cependant, comme il venait d’arriver, Renée le lui montra qui traversait solennellement le salon, tenant un bougeoir à la main. Le grand valet, avec sa carrure de ministre, éclairé par la lumière jaune de la cire, avait, cette nuit-là, un visage plus correct et plus sévère encore que de coutume. En se penchant, les amants le virent souffler sa bougie et se diriger vers les écuries, où dormaient les chevaux et les palefreniers.","Maxime came back every night. He would come through the garden at about one o'clock. Most often, Renée waited for him in the greenhouse, which he had to cross to reach the small drawing-room. They were, moreover, perfectly impudent, barely concealing themselves, forgetting the most classic precautions of adultery. This corner of the hotel, it is true, belonged to them. Baptiste, the husband's valet, had the sole right of entry, and Baptiste, a serious man, disappeared as soon as his shift was over. Maxime even claimed, laughing, that he was retiring to write his Memoirs. One night, however, when he had just arrived, Renée showed him solemnly crossing the drawing-room, holding a candlestick in his hand. The grand valet, with his minister's build, illuminated by the yellow light of the wax, had, that night, a face more correct and even more severe than usual. Leaning over, the lovers saw him blow out his candle and go towards the stables, where the horses and grooms slept.","Maxime returned night after night. He entered by way of the garden around one o’clock. Usually Renée was waiting for him in the conservatory, which he had to cross to reach the small salon.

Only Baptiste, the husband’s valet, was allowed to enter, and Baptiste, a serious sort of man, vanished the moment his duties were discharged. Maxime joked that he probably went off to write his memoirs. One night, however, shortly after Maxime arrived, Renée pointed out the valet solemnly making his way across the salon, candlestick in hand. With his ministerial bearing, and his face illuminated by the yellow light of burning wax, the tall servant looked even more proper and austere than usual.

Dès dix heures et demie, le grand salon se trouvait plein, et, comme il y avait bal ensuite, les femmes étaient là, costumées, assises sur des fauteuils rangés en demi-cercle devant le théâtre improvisé, une estrade que cachaient deux larges rideaux de velours rouge à franges d’or, glissant sur des tringles. Les hommes, derrière, se tenaient debout, allaient et venaient. Les tapissiers avaient donné à dix heures les derniers coups de marteau. L’estrade s’élevait au fond du salon, tenant tout un bout de cette longue galerie. On montait sur le théâtre par le fumoir, converti en foyer pour les artistes. En outre, au premier étage, ces dames avaient à leur disposition plusieurs pièces, où une armée de femmes de chambre préparaient les toilettes des différents tableaux.","The Loves of the handsome Narcissus and the nymph Echo were to begin at eleven o'clock. By ten-thirty the large salon was full, and as there was a ball afterwards, the women were there, in costume, seated on armchairs arranged in a semi-circle in front of the improvised theatre, a platform hidden by two large curtains. of red velvet with gold fringes, sliding on rods. The men behind were standing, walking back and forth. The upholsterers had given the last blows of the hammer at ten o'clock. The platform rose at the back of the room, holding a whole end of this long gallery. We went up to the theater through the smoking room, converted into a foyer for the artists. In addition, on the first floor, these ladies had at their disposal several rooms, where an army of maids prepared the toilets for the various paintings.","“The Amours of Handsome Narcissus and the Nymph Echo” was to begin at eleven o’clock.

The men, standing behind them, came and went. The decorators had finished their hammering by ten. The platform filled one end of the long gallery. Access to the stage was through the smoking room, which had been converted to a greenroom for the artists.

The men stood at the back, or moved to and fro. At ten o’clock the upholsterers had driven in the last nail. The platform was erected at the end of the long drawing room, and occupied a whole section of it. The stage was approached from the smoking room, which had been turned into a green room for the actors. In addition, the ladies had at their disposal a number of rooms on the first floor, where an army of maidservants laid out the costumes for the different tableaux."

"Et il raconta le mot. On le trouva tout à fait réussi. Ces messieurs se le répétèrent. Le digne M. Haffner, qui s’était approché, ne put lui-même s’empêcher d’applaudir. Cependant, un piano, que peu de personnes avaient vu, se mit à jouer une valse. Il se fit alors un grand silence. La valse avait des enroulements capricieux, interminables ; et toujours une phrase très douce montait le clavier, se perdait dans un trille de rossignol ; puis des voix sourdes reprenaient, plus lentement. C’était très voluptueux. Les dames, la tête un peu inclinée, souriaient. Le piano avait, au contraire, fait tomber brusquement la gaieté de M. Hupel de la Noue. Il regardait les rideaux de velours rouge d’un air anxieux, il se disait qu’il aurait dû placer lui-même Mme d’Espanet comme il avait placé les autres.","And he told the word. We found it quite successful. These gentlemen repeated it to each other. Worthy Mr. Haffner, who had approached, himself could not help applauding. However, a piano, which few people had seen, began to play a waltz. Then there was a great silence. The waltz had capricious, interminable windings; and always a very soft phrase ascended the keyboard, was lost in a nightingale's trill; then muffled voices resumed, more slowly. It was very voluptuous. The ladies, their heads bowed a little, smiled. The piano, on the contrary, had suddenly brought down the gaiety of M. Hupel de la Noue. He gazed anxiously at the red velvet curtains, he said to himself that he should have placed Madame d'Espanet himself as he had placed the others.","And he repeated her repartee. Everyone agreed that it was just right. The men repeated it to one another. M. Haffner had joined the group, and, dignified though he was, even he could not refrain from applauding. Meanwhile, someone seated at a piano that hardly anyone had noticed began to play a waltz. A hush came over the crowd. The waltz wound on through an endless series of variations, all involving a sweet ascending phrase ending in a trill and preceding a return to a slower melody in the bass. It was quite sensual. The ladies, tilting their heads slightly, smiled. In contrast, the piano had abruptly put an end to M. Hupel de la Noue’s gaiety. He gazed anxiously at the red velvet curtain and told himself that he ought to have posed Mme d’Espanet personally, as he had posed the others.","He told the story. It was considered very witty. The gentlemen repeated it to one another. Even the dignified Monsieur Haffner, who had drawn nearer, could not help applauding. Meanwhile a piano, which few of them had noticed, began to play a waltz. Then there was a great silence. The waltz had endless, capricious variations; a very soft phrase rose from the keyboard, finishing in a nightingale’s trill; then deeper notes took up the theme, more slowly. It was very voluptuous. The ladies, their heads a little to one side, smiled. On the other hand the piano had put a sudden stop to Monsieur Hupel de la Noue’s merriment. He looked anxiously in the direction of the red velvet curtains, thinking that he ought to have posed Madame d’Espanet himself, as he had posed the others."

"L’affaire fut ainsi enlevée. Mais il avait encore des craintes. Il redoutait que ce chiffre de cinq cent mille francs ne parût un peu gros à la commission des indemnités, pour une maison qui n’en valait notoirement que deux cent mille. La hausse formidable sur les immeubles n’avait pas encore eu lieu. Une enquête lui aurait fait courir le risque de sérieux désagréments. Il se rappelait cette phrase de son frère : « Pas de scandale trop bruyant, ou je te supprime » ; et il savait Eugène homme à exécuter sa menace. Il s’agissait de rendre aveugles et bienveillants ces messieurs de la commission. Il jeta les yeux sur deux hommes influents dont il s’était fait des amis par la façon dont il les saluait dans les corridors, lorsqu’il les rencontrait. Les trente-six membres du conseil municipal étaient choisis avec soin de la main même de l’empereur, sur la présentation du préfet, parmi les sénateurs, les députés, les avocats, les médecins, les grands industriels qui s’agenouillaient le plus dévotement devant le pouvoir ; mais, entre tous, le baron Gouraud et M. Toutin-Laroche méritaient la bienveillance des Tuileries par leur ferveur.","The case was thus removed. But he still had fears. He was afraid that this figure of five hundred thousand francs would appear a little high to the commission of indemnities, for a house which was notoriously worth only two hundred thousand. The tremendous rise on buildings had not yet taken place. An investigation would have put him at risk of serious inconvenience. He remembered this sentence of his brother: ""No scandal too loud, or I'll kill you""; and he knew Eugene the man to carry out his threat. It was a question of rendering blind and benevolent these gentlemen of the commission. He glanced at two influential men whom he had made friends by the way he greeted them in the hallways when he met them. The thirty-six members of the municipal council were chosen with care by the hand of the emperor himself, on the presentation of the prefect, from among the senators, deputies, lawyers, doctors, the great industrialists who knelt most devoutly. in front of power; but, above all, Baron Gouraud and M. Toutin-Laroche deserved the benevolence of the Tuileries by their fervor.","That sealed the deal. Saccard was still anxious, though. He was afraid that the 500,000-franc figure might strike the indemnity commission as somewhat inflated for a house well-known to be worth 200,000 at best. The remarkable rise in real estate values had yet to take place. An investigation would have subjected him to a risk of serious unpleasantness. He remembered what his brother had said to him: “No unseemly scandals, or I’ll get rid of you.” And he knew Eugène to be the kind of man to carry out such a threat. The honorable members of the commission would need to have the wool pulled over their eyes, and their goodwill would have to be secured. He looked to two influential men whose friendship he had won by the way he greeted them in hallways when they met. The thirty-six members of the municipal council were handpicked by the Emperor himself, on the prefect’s recommendation, from among the senators, deputies, lawyers, doctors, and leading industrialists who knelt most devoutly before the majesty of the government. Of all of them, however, two had earned the favor of the Tuileries by their zealousness: Baron Gouraud and M. Toutin-Laroche.","The business was thus concluded. But he still had fears. He dreaded that the sum of five hundred thousand francs would strike the Compensation Authority as rather excessive for a house that was known to be worth at most two hundred thousand. The explosion in property values had not yet taken place. An inquiry would have exposed him to serious unpleasantness. He remembered his brother’s words: ‘If you create a scandal, I’ll destroy you’, and he knew Eugène was a man of his word. It was a question of blindfolding the gentlemen of the Authority and ensuring their good will. He glanced at two influential men, of whom he had made friends through his habit of greeting them in the corridors when he met them. The thirty-six members of the City Council were hand-picked by the Emperor himself, on the recommendation of the Prefect, from among the senators, deputies, lawyers, doctors, and great men of industry who prostrated themselves before the reigning power; but among them all, the fervour of Baron Gouraud and of Monsieur Toutin-Laroche especially attracted the good will of the Tuileries."

"Renée s’inquiétait avec raison. Saccard, depuis quelque temps, songeait au mariage de son fils avec Mlle de Mareuil. Il y avait là une dot d’un million qu’il ne voulait pas laisser échapper, comptant plus tard mettre les mains dans cet argent. Louise, vers le commencement de l’hiver, étant restée au lit pendant près de trois semaines, il eut une telle peur de la voir mourir avant l’union projetée, qu’il se décida à marier les enfants tout de suite. Il les trouvait bien un peu jeunes ; mais les médecins redoutaient le mois de mars pour la poitrinaire. De son côté, M. de Mareuil était dans une situation délicate. Au dernier scrutin, il avait enfin réussi à se faire nommer député. Seulement, le Corps législatif venait de casser son élection, qui fut le scandale de la révision des pouvoirs. Cette élection était tout un poème héroï-comique, sur lequel les journaux vécurent pendant un mois. M. Hupel de la Noue, le préfet du département, avait déployé une telle vigueur, que les autres candidats ne purent même afficher leur profession de foi ni distribuer leurs bulletins. Sur ses conseils, M. de Mareuil couvrit la circonscription de tables où les paysans burent et mangèrent pendant une semaine. Il promit, en outre, un chemin de fer, la construction d’un pont et de trois églises, et adressa, la veille du scrutin, aux électeurs influents, les portraits de l’empereur et de l’impératrice, deux grandes gravures recouvertes d’une vitre et encadrées d’une baguette d’or. Cet envoi eut un succès fou, la majorité fut écrasante. Mais quand la Chambre, devant l’éclat de rire de la France entière, se trouva forcée de renvoyer M. de Mareuil à ses électeurs, le ministre entra dans une colère terrible contre le préfet et le malheureux candidat, qui s’étaient montrés vraiment trop « roides ». Il parla même de mettre la candidature officielle sur un autre nom. M. de Mareuil fut épouvanté, il avait dépensé trois cent mille francs dans le département, il y possédait de grandes propriétés où il s’ennuyait, et qu’il lui faudrait revendre à perte. Aussi vint-il supplier son cher collègue d’apaiser son frère, de lui promettre, en son nom, une élection tout à fait convenable. Ce fut en cette circonstance que Saccard reparla du mariage des enfants, et que les deux pères l’arrêtèrent définitivement.","Renee was rightly worried. Saccard had been thinking for some time of his son's marriage to Mademoiselle de Mareuil. There was a dowry of a million there which he did not want to let slip, counting later on to get his hands on that money. Louise, towards the beginning of winter, having remained in bed for nearly three weeks, he was so afraid of seeing her die before the projected union, that he decided to marry off the children at once. He found them rather young; but the doctors dreaded the month of March for the chest pain. For his part, M. de Mareuil was in a delicate situation. In the last ballot, he had finally succeeded in getting himself elected deputy. However, the Legislative Body had just rescinded its election, which was the scandal of the revision of powers. This election was a whole heroic-comic poem, on which the newspapers lived for a month. M. Hupel de la Noue, the prefect of the department, had displayed such vigor that the other candidates could not even post their profession of faith or distribute their ballots. On his advice, M. de Mareuil covered the district with tables where the peasants drank and ate for a week. He also promised a railway, the construction of a bridge and three churches, and sent the portraits of the Emperor and Empress, two large engravings covered of glass and framed by a gold rod. This shipment was a huge success, the majority was overwhelming. But when the Chamber, faced with the burst of laughter from the whole of France, found itself forced to send M. de Mareuil back to his electors, the minister flew into a terrible rage against the prefect and the unfortunate candidate, who had shown themselves to be really too ""stiff"". He even talked about putting the official candidacy on another name. M. de Mareuil was terrified, he had spent three hundred thousand francs in the department, he owned large properties there where he was bored, and which he would have to sell at a loss. So he came to beg his dear colleague to appease his brother, to promise him, in his name, a perfectly acceptable election. It was on this occasion that Saccard again spoke of the marriage of the children, and that the two fathers decided upon it definitively.","Renée worried, with reason. Saccard had for some time been thinking about marrying his son off to Mlle de Mareuil. There was a dowry worth a million francs that he did not want to let slip through his fingers, for he meant to get his hands on the money eventually. When Louise remained bedridden for three weeks at the beginning of the winter, he became so frightened that she might die before the planned wedding took place that he made up his mind to do it immediately. They were indeed a little young, but the doctors warned that the month of March was particularly dangerous for a girl with tuberculosis. Meanwhile, M. de Mareuil found himself in a delicate situation. In the last election, he had finally managed to get himself elected as deputy, but the Corps Législatif had quashed the result, which had been the scandal of the governmental reorganization. The story of the vote had made for a comic epic, in fact, and the newspapers had made hay with it for a month. M. Hupel de la Noue, the prefect of the département, had acted with such vigor that the other candidates had not been able to post their platforms or distribute their brochures. Following his advice, M. de Mareuil had covered the district with tables that had distributed food and drink to the peasants for an entire week. He had promised, moreover, to build a railroad, a bridge, and three churches, and on the eve of the voting had sent influential voters portraits of the Emperor and Empress, two large engravings under glass in gold frames. This gift had proved fabulously successful; the majority was overwhelming. But when the Chamber, faced with laughter from all of France, found itself forced to send M. de Mareuil back to confront the voters a second time, the minister flew into a rage against the prefect and the hapless candidate, who had really been too “clumsy.” He even broached the idea of choosing another man as the official candidate. M. de Mareuil was terrified. He had spent 300,000 francs in the département, where he owned vast estates that bored him to tears and that he would be forced to sell at a loss. He therefore begged his dear colleague to calm his brother down and promise him, in the candidate’s name, an altogether proper election. It was in these circumstances that Saccard again brought up the matter of the marriage of their two children, on which the fathers finally agreed.","Renée had reason to be worried. Saccard had for some time been thinking of his son’s marriage with Mademoiselle de Mareuil. There was a dowry of a million there, which he was determined not to let out of his sight, intending later on to appropriate the money for himself. Louise, at the beginning of winter, had stayed in bed for nearly three weeks, and Saccard was so afraid of seeing her die before the projected wedding that he resolved to have the children married forthwith. He did think them a trifle young, but then the doctors feared the month of March for the consumptive girl. Monsieur de Mareuil, for his part, was in a delicate position. At the last poll he had finally succeeded in being returned as a deputy; but the Corps Législatif had just quashed his election, which was the great scandal of the revisions. * The election was a mock-heroic affair, and kept the newspapers going for a month. Monsieur Hupel de la Noue, the Prefect of the department, had displayed such vigour that the other candidates had been prevented even from placarding their election addresses or distributing their voting papers. Acting on his advice, Monsieur de Mareuil had filled the constituency with tables at which the peasants ate and drank for a week. He promised, moreover, a railway line, a new bridge, and three churches, and on the eve of the poll he forwarded to the most influential electors portraits of the Emperor and Empress, two large engravings covered with glass and set in gilt frames. This gift was an enormous success, and the majority was overwhelming. But when the Chamber, faced with the derisive reaction of the whole of France, found itself compelled to send Monsieur de Mareuil back to his electors, the minister flew into a terrible rage with the Prefect and the unfortunate candidate, who had really shown themselves to be too ‘hot’. He even spoke of choosing someone else as the official candidate. Monsieur de Mareuil was flabbergasted; he had spent three hundred thousand francs on the department, he owned large estates there, where he was bored to death, and which he would have to sell at a loss. So he came to beg his dear colleague to pacify his brother, and to promise him in his name an absolutely decorous election. It was on this occasion that Saccard again spoke of the children’s marriage, and that the two parents finally settled the matter."

"La fenêtre s’ouvrait si grande, que le ciel, avec tous ses rayons, tout son air, tout son bleu, semblait y entrer. Perchée comme un pigeonnier, elle avait de longues caisses de fleurs, une immense volière, et pas un meuble. On avait simplement étalé une natte sur le carreau. C’était la « chambre des enfants ». Dans tout l’hôtel, on la connaissait, on la désignait sous ce nom. La maison était si froide, la cour si humide, que la tante Élisabeth avait redouté pour Christine et Renée ce souffle frais qui tombait des murs ; maintes fois, elle avait grondé les gamines qui couraient sous les arcades et qui prenaient plaisir à tremper leurs petits bras dans l’eau glacée de la fontaine. Alors, l’idée lui était venue de faire disposer pour elles ce grenier perdu, le seul coin où le soleil entrât et se réjouît, solitaire, depuis bientôt deux siècles, au milieu des toiles d’araignée. Elle leur donna une natte, des oiseaux, des fleurs. Les gamines furent enthousiasmées. Pendant les vacances, Renée vivait là, dans le bain jaune de ce bon soleil, qui semblait heureux de la toilette qu’on avait faite à sa retraite et des deux têtes blondes qu’on lui envoyait. La chambre devint un paradis, toute résonnante du chant des oiseaux et du babil des petites. On la leur avait cédée en toute propriété. Elles disaient « notre chambre » ; elles étaient chez elles ; elles allaient jusqu’à s’y enfermer à clef pour se bien prouver qu’elles en étaient les uniques maîtresses. Quel coin de bonheur ! Un massacre de joujoux râlait sur la natte, dans le soleil clair.","The window opened so wide that the sky, with all its rays, all its air, all its blue, seemed to enter it.

The house was so cold, the courtyard so damp, that Aunt Élisabeth had feared for Christine and Renée this cool breeze which fell from the walls; many times she had scolded the little girls who ran under the arches and who took pleasure in dipping their little arms in the icy water of the fountain. Then the idea had occurred to him to arrange for them this lost attic, the only corner where the sun entered and rejoiced, solitary, for nearly two centuries, in the midst of cobwebs. She gave them a mat, birds, flowers. The kids were thrilled. During the holidays, Renée lived there, in the yellow bath of this good sun, who seemed happy with the toilet they had made on her retirement and the two blond heads they sent her. The room became a paradise, all resonant with the chirping of birds and the chatter of the little ones. It had been ceded to them in full ownership. They said ""our room""; they were at home; they went so far as to lock themselves in to prove to themselves that they were its sole mistresses. What a corner of happiness! A massacre of toys rattled on the mat, in the bright sun.","The window was so wide that the sky, with all its radiance, all its fresh air, all its blue color seemed to enter in. Perched aloft like a dovecote, it contained long flower boxes, an immense aviary, and not a single piece of furniture. A simple mat had been laid down over the tile floor. This was the “children’s room.” Throughout the house this was the name by which the room was known and referred to. The house was so cold and the courtyard so damp that Aunt Elisabeth had been afraid that Christine and Renée might catch a chill from the walls. She had often scolded the active little girls, who liked to race through the arcades and dip their tiny arms into the frigid water of the fountain. Then it occurred to her to have the forgotten loft fixed up for them, this being for centuries the only spot in the house where the sun was allowed in to disport itself in solitude among the spider-webs. She had given them a mat, some birds, and flowers. The girls were delighted. During vacations, Renée lived up there, bathing in the warm yellow rays of the sun, which seemed pleased with the way its hideout had been fixed up and with the two blondes it had been sent. The chamber became a paradise, resounding with the songs of the birds and the babble of the little girls. Ownership had been ceded entirely to them. They called it “our room.” They were at home in it. They went so far as to lock themselves in to prove to themselves beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were the sole mistresses of the premises. What a happy place! A hecatomb of playthings lay strewn about the mat in the bright sunshine.","The window opened so wide that the sky itself, with all its sunbeams, all its ether, all its blue, seemed to enter the room. It was perched aloft like a dovecote, and contained long flower-boxes, an immense aviary, and not a single piece of furniture. There was just some matting spread over the floor. This was ‘the children’s room’. Throughout the house it was known and spoken of by that name. The house was so cold, the courtyard so damp, that Aunt Élisabeth had been afraid that Christine and Renée would suffer harm from the chill breath that hung about the walls; she had often scolded the children for running about the colonnades and amusing themselves by dipping their little arms into the icy water of the fountain. After a while she had the idea of using this forgotten attic for them, the only corner into which, for nearly two centuries, the sun had entered and rejoiced, in the midst of the cobwebs. She gave them some matting, birds, and flowers. The children were ecstatically happy. Renée lived there during the holidays, bathing in the yellow rays of the sun, which seemed pleased with the adornment of his retreat and with the two fair-haired creatures sent to keep him company. The room became a paradise, resounding with birdsong and the children’s babbling. It had been given to them for their exclusive use. They spoke of ‘our room’; it was their home; they went so far as to lock themselves in, so as to put it beyond doubt that they were the sole mistresses of the room. What a happy nook! On the matting lay a battlefield of toys, expiring in the bright sunshine."
"Il souriait d’un air bonhomme. Elle resta dans une cruelle angoisse. Elle sentait qu’elle perdrait le peu d’équilibre qui lui restait si elle se livrait à son mari. Son dernier orgueil était d’être mariée au père mais de n’être que la femme du fils. Souvent, quand Maxime lui semblait froid, elle essayait de lui faire comprendre cette situation par des allusions fort claires ; il est vrai que le jeune homme, qu’elle s’attendait à voir tomber à ses pieds, après cette confidence, demeurait parfaitement indifférent, croyant sans doute qu’elle voulait le rassurer sur la possibilité d’une rencontre entre son père et lui, dans la chambre de soie grise.","He smiled good-naturedly. She remained in cruel anguish. She felt that she would lose what little balance she had left if she gave herself up to her husband.

Frequently, when Maxime seemed cold to her, she tried to make him understand with the most transparent of allusions how things stood between her and her husband. Yet the young man, whom she expected to fall at her feet after these confessions, remained utterly unmoved, no doubt thinking that she merely wanted to reassure him that there was no possibility of his running into his father in the gray silk bedroom.","He smiled good-naturedly.

He stepped back, came closer, screwed up his eyes, and murmured:"
"Des embarras terribles attendaient Renée et Maxime à Paris. Plusieurs des billets souscrits à Larsonneau étaient échus ; mais, comme Saccard les laissait naturellement dormir chez l’huissier, ces billets inquiétaient peu la jeune femme. Elle se trouvait bien autrement effrayée par sa dette chez Worms qui montait maintenant à près de deux cent mille francs. Le tailleur exigeait un acompte, en menaçant de suspendre tout crédit. Elle avait de brusques frissons, quand elle songeait au scandale d’un procès, et surtout à une fâcherie avec l’illustre couturier. Puis il lui fallait de l’argent de poche. Ils allaient s’ennuyer à mourir, elle et Maxime, s’ils n’avaient pas quelques louis à dépenser par jour. Le cher enfant était à sec, depuis qu’il fouillait vainement les tiroirs de son père. Sa fidélité, sa sagesse exemplaire, pendant sept à huit mois, tenaient beaucoup au vide absolu de sa bourse. Il n’avait pas toujours vingt francs pour inviter quelque coureuse à souper. Aussi revenait-il philosophiquement à l’hôtel. La jeune femme, à chacune de leurs escapades, lui remettait son porte-monnaie pour qu’il payât dans les restaurants, dans les bals, dans les petits théâtres. Elle continuait à le traiter maternellement ; et même c’était elle qui payait, du bout de ses doigts gantés, chez le pâtissier où ils s’arrêtaient presque chaque après-midi, pour manger des petits pâtés aux huîtres. Souvent, il trouvait, le matin, dans son gilet, des louis qu’il ne savait pas là, et qu’elle y avait mis, comme une mère qui garnit la poche d’un collégien. Et cette belle existence de goûters, de caprices satisfaits, de plaisirs faciles, allait cesser ! Mais une crainte plus grave encore vint les consterner. Le bijoutier de Sylvia, auquel il devait dix mille francs, se fâchait, parlait de Clichy. Les billets qu’il avait en main, protestés depuis longtemps, étaient couverts de tels frais, que la dette se trouvait grossie de trois ou quatre milliers de francs. Saccard déclara nettement qu’il ne pouvait rien. Son fils à Clichy le poserait, et quand il l’en retirerait, il ferait grand bruit de cette largesse paternelle. Renée était au désespoir ; elle voyait son cher enfant en prison, mais dans un véritable cachot, couché sur de la paille humide. Un soir, elle lui proposa sérieusement de ne plus sortir de chez elle, d’y vivre ignoré de tous, à l’abri des recors. Puis elle jura qu’elle trouverait l’argent. Jamais elle ne parlait de l’origine de la dette, de cette Sylvia qui confiait ses amours aux glaces des cabinets particuliers. C’était une cinquantaine de mille francs qu’il lui fallait : quinze mille pour Maxime, trente mille pour Worms, et cinq mille francs d’argent de poche. Ils auraient devant eux quinze grands jours de bonheur. Elle se mit en campagne.","Terrible embarrassments awaited Renée and Maxime in Paris. Several of the notes subscribed to Larsonneau had expired; but, as Saccard naturally let them sleep at the bailiff's, these notes troubled the young woman little. She found herself much more frightened by her debt with Worms, which now amounted to nearly two hundred thousand francs. The tailor demanded a deposit, threatening to suspend all credit. She had sudden shivers when she thought of the scandal of a lawsuit, and especially of an argument with the illustrious couturier. Then he needed pocket money. They would be bored to death, she and Maxime, if they didn't have a few louis to spend a day. The dear child was dry, since he had been rummaging through his father's drawers in vain. His fidelity, his exemplary wisdom, for seven or eight months, had much to do with the absolute emptiness of his purse. He did not always have twenty francs to invite some runner to supper. So he returned philosophically to the hotel. The young woman, at each of their escapades, gave him her purse so that he could pay in restaurants, at balls, in small theatres. She continued to treat him motherly; and she was even the one who paid, with the tips of her gloved fingers, at the pastry cook where they stopped almost every afternoon to eat little oyster pies. Often he found, in the morning, in his waistcoat, louis which he did not know were there, and which she had put there, like a mother lining the pocket of a schoolboy. And this beautiful existence of snacks, of satisfied whims, of easy pleasures, was about to cease! But a still graver fear came to dismay them. Sylvia's jeweler, to whom he owed ten thousand francs, got angry and talked about Clichy. The notes he had in hand, protested for a long time, were covered with such charges that the debt was increased by three or four thousand francs. Saccard clearly declared that he could do nothing. His son in Clichy would put it down, and when he took it out, he would make a great noise about this paternal generosity. Renee was in despair; she saw her dear child in prison, but in a real dungeon, lying on damp straw. One evening, she seriously offered him not to leave her house, to live there unknown to everyone, sheltered from the records. Then she swore she would find the money. She never spoke of the origin of the debt, of this Sylvia who confided her love affairs to the mirrors of private cabinets. He needed fifty thousand francs: fifteen thousand for Maxime, thirty thousand for Worms, and five thousand francs for pocket money. They would have a fortnight of great happiness ahead of them. She took to the field.","Terrible financial difficulties awaited Renée and Maxime in Paris. Several of the notes payable to Larsonneau had come due, but since Saccard of course left them lying untouched at the bailiff ’s office, Renée didn’t worry much about them. She was a good deal more terrified of her debt to Worms, which had now risen to nearly 200,000 francs. The tailor was demanding partial payment, in lieu of which he threatened to cut off her credit. She shuddered at the thought of the scandal that a lawsuit would cause and above all at the idea of a to-do with the illustrious couturier. She also needed pocket money. She and Maxime would die of boredom if they didn’t have several louis to spend every day. The dear child was broke now that his forays into his father’s cabinets were coming up empty. His fidelity and exemplary behavior over the past seven or eight months had had a great deal to do with the emptiness of his wallet. He didn’t always have twenty francs to invite a trollop to supper, so he philosophically returned home. On each of their escapades Renée opened her purse so that he could pay in the restaurants, dance halls, and burlesque houses they visited. She still treated him maternally and even handled money herself, with the tips of her gloved fingers, at the pastry shop where they stopped nearly every afternoon to eat little oyster pâtés. Many mornings he found louis in his jacket that he didn’t know were there, money she had put there as a mother to make sure her boy didn’t go off to school with empty pockets. And now this delightful life of tasty treats, gratified whims, and facile pleasures was to end! But that was not their greatest worry. Sylvia’s jeweler, to whom Maxime owed 10,000 francs, was angry and made dark allusions to Clichy—the debtor’s prison. The notes he held, long since overdue, had accumulated so many penalties that the young man’s debt had increased by another three or four thousand francs. Saccard declared flatly that he could do nothing. His son in prison would garner him a certain notoriety, and when he bailed the boy out, the news of his paternal generosity would spread far and wide. Renée was in despair. When she envisioned her dear child in prison, she imagined him in a dungeon lying on a bed of damp straw. One night she seriously proposed that they stop going out, that they remain shut up at home out of everyone’s sight and beyond the reach of the law’s minions. And she swore that she would find the money. She never mentioned the reason for the debt or the name of Sylvia, who recorded her amours on the mirrors of private rooms in restaurants. She needed 50,000 francs: 15,000 for Maxime, 30,000 for Worms, and 5,000 for pocket money. That would buy them two solid weeks of happiness. She set to work.","Terrible problems awaited Renée and Maxime in Paris. Several of the promissory notes made out to Larsonneau were overdue; but as Saccard naturally left them lying on the bailiff’s desk, they did not worry his young wife unduly. She was far more alarmed by her debt to Worms, which now amounted to nearly two hundred thousand francs. He insisted on a deposit, and threatened to stop her credit. She shuddered at the thought of the scandal of a lawsuit, and especially of a quarrel with the illustrious dressmaker. Moreover, she needed some pocket money. They would be bored to death, Maxime and she, without a few louis to spend every day. The dear child was quite broke since he had begun to rummage vainly in his father’s drawers. His fidelity, his exemplary behaviour during the last seven or eight months, were largely due to the fact that his purse was totally empty. He rarely had twenty francs with which to take a girl out to supper, and so he philosophically used to return to the house. Renée, on each of their escapades, handed him her purse so that he might pay at the restaurants, balls, and boulevard theatres. She continued to treat him as a child; she even paid, with the tips of her gloved fingers, at the pastry-cook’s, where they stopped almost every afternoon to eat little oyster patties. In the morning he often found in his waistcoat a few louis he did not know he had, and which she had put there, like a mother filling a schoolboy’s pockets. To think that this charming life of odd snacks, of satisfied whims and facile pleasures, was to end! But a still greater fear took hold of them. Sylvia’s jeweller, to whom Maxime owed ten thousand francs, grew angry and talked of prison. The costs had so accumulated on the acceptances he had in hand and had long protested,* that the debt had increased by some three or four thousand francs. Saccard declared flatly that he could do nothing. A spell in Clichy* would settle Maxime down, and when he took him out he would make a great fuss about his paternal generosity. Renée was in despair; she imagined her dear child in prison, in a veritable dungeon, lying on damp straw. One night she seriously proposed to him not to leave her again, to live there unknown to everyone, safe from the bailiff’s men. Then she swore she would find the money. She never spoke of the origin of the debt, of Sylvia who confided her affairs to the mirrors of private rooms. She wanted about fifty thousand francs, fifteen thousand for Maxime, thirty thousand for Worms, and five thousand for pocket money. Then they would have two weeks of happiness before them. She embarked on her campaign."

"Les appartements de l’hôtel avaient le calme triste, la solennité froide de la cour. Desservis par un large escalier à rampe de fer, où les pas et la toux des visiteurs sonnaient comme sous une voûte d’église, ils s’étendaient en longues enfilades de vastes et hautes pièces, dans lesquelles se perdaient de vieux meubles, de bois sombre et trapu ; et le demi-jour n’était peuplé que par les personnages des tapisseries, dont on apercevait vaguement les grands corps blêmes. Tout le luxe de l’ancienne bourgeoisie parisienne était là, un luxe inusable et sans mollesse, des sièges dont le chêne est recouvert à peine d’un peu d’étoupe, des lits aux étoffes rigides, des bahuts à linge où la rudesse des planches compromettrait singulièrement la frêle existence des robes modernes. M. Béraud du Châtel avait choisi son appartement dans la partie la plus noire de l’hôtel, entre la rue et la cour, au premier étage. Il se trouvait là dans un cadre merveilleux de recueillement, de silence et d’ombre. Quand il poussait les portes, traversant la solennité des pièces, de son pas lent et grave, on l’eût pris pour un de ces membres des vieux parlements, dont on voyait les portraits accrochés aux murs, rentrant chez lui tout songeur, après avoir discuté et refusé de signer un édit du roi.","The hotel apartments had the sad calm, the cold solemnity of the courtyard. Served by a wide staircase with iron banisters, where the footsteps and coughs of visitors sounded as if under a church vault, they extended in long rows of vast and high rooms, in which were lost old furniture, wood dark and stocky; and the twilight was peopled only by the figures in the tapestries, whose tall pale bodies could be vaguely perceived. All the luxury of the old Parisian bourgeoisie was there, an indestructible luxury without softness, seats whose oak is barely covered with a little tow, beds with rigid fabrics, chests for linen where the roughness of the boards would singularly compromise the frail existence of modern dresses. M. Béraud du Châtel had chosen his apartment in the darkest part of the hotel, between the street and the courtyard, on the first floor. He found himself there in a marvelous setting of contemplation, silence and shade. When he pushed open the doors, crossing the solemnity of the rooms, with his slow and serious step, one would have taken him for one of those members of the old parliaments, whose portraits one saw hanging on the walls, returning to his house pensive, after having discussed and refused to sign an edict from the king.","The apartments within the mansion exuded the same mournful calm and frigid formality as the courtyard. The stairwell leading up to them was broad and guarded with an iron rail, and within it every footstep, every cough, resounded as beneath the vault of a church. Long suites of vast rooms with high ceilings dwarfed the old furniture, which was built low of dark wood. The dusky gloom was peopled solely by the figures in the tapestries, whose large, colorless bodies could barely be made out. All the luxury of the old Paris bourgeoisie was represented here, a luxury as unusable as it was unyielding: chairs whose oak seats were barely covered by a cushion of hemp, beds with stiff sheets, linen chests whose rough boards were singularly hard on frail modern finery. M. Béraud Du Châtel had chosen for himself an apartment in the gloomiest part of the house, on the second floor between the street and the courtyard. There he found himself in surroundings remarkable for their shadowy silence and conducive to meditation. When he pushed open the doors and made his slow, lugubrious way through the solemn apartments, he resembled one of the members of the old parlements whose portraits were affixed to the walls, a man lost in thought on his way home after debating and refusing to sign a royal edict.","The rooms of the house had the sad calm, the cold solemnity of the courtyard. Approached by a broad iron-railed staircase, on which the footsteps and coughs of visitors echoed as in the aisle of a church, they stretched in long strings of wide, lofty rooms, in which the heavy, old-fashioned furniture of dark wood was lost; and the pale light was peopled only by the figures on the tapestries, whose great, pale shapes could just be made out. All the luxury of the old-fashioned Parisian bourgeoisie was there, Spartan and ageless. Chairs whose oak seats are barely covered with a little tow, beds with stiff sheets, linen-chests whose roughness would probably damage delicate modern garments. Monsieur Béraud du Châtel had chosen to live in the darkest part of the mansion, between the street and the courtyard, on the first floor. He had found there a refuge of tranquillity, silence, and gloom. When he opened the doors and walked through the rooms with his slow, solemn step, he might have been taken for one of the members of the old parlements* whose portraits were hung on the walls, returning home deep in thought after discussing and refusing to sign an edict of the king."

"Aristide Rougon s’abattit sur Paris, au lendemain du 2 Décembre, avec ce flair des oiseaux de proie qui sentent de loin les champs de bataille. Il arrivait de Plassans, une sous-préfecture du Midi, où son père venait enfin de pêcher dans l’eau trouble des événements une recette particulière longtemps convoitée. Lui, jeune encore, après s’être compromis comme un sot, sans gloire ni profit, avait dû s’estimer heureux de se tirer sain et sauf de la bagarre. Il accourait, enrageant d’avoir fait fausse route, maudissant la province, parlant de Paris avec des appétits de loup, jurant « qu’il ne serait plus si bête » ; et le sourire aigu dont il accompagnait ces mots prenait une terrible signification sur ses lèvres minces.","Aristide Rougon descended on Paris, the day after December 2, with the flair of birds of prey that smell of battlefields from afar.

He, still young, after compromising himself like a fool, without glory or profit, must have considered himself lucky to get out of the fight safe and sound. He would come running, furious at having taken the wrong road, cursing the provinces, talking of Paris with the appetites of a wolf, swearing ""that he would no longer be so stupid""; and the sharp smile with which he accompanied these words took on a terrible significance on his thin lips.","Aristide Saccard swooped down on Paris immediately after the Second of December1 with the keen instincts of a bird of prey capable of smelling a battlefield from a long way off. He came from Plassans, a small subprefecture in the south, where his father, fishing in the troubled waters of the times, had at last succeeded in landing a long-coveted prize: a nomination as tax collector. The son, still a young man, had foolishly compromised himself without reaping either glory or profit and had to count himself lucky to have come through the ruckus safely. He rushed off to Paris in a rage at having mistaken his true course, cursing the provinces while talking of the capital in terms that called to mind a ravenous wolf, and swearing that “he would never again be so stupid.” The bitter smile that accompanied these words took on a horrible significance on his thin lips.","ARISTIDE ROUGON swooped down on Paris the day after 2 December,* like a bird of prey scenting the field of battle from afar.

He himself, still young, had compromised himself like a fool, gaining neither fame nor fortune, and considered himself fortunate to have emerged safe and sound from the fray. * He came in a great hurry, furious at having taken a wrong turn, cursing the provinces, talking of Paris with the ravenous hunger of a wolf, swearing ‘that he would never be such a fool again’; and his bitter smile as he said these words assumed a terrible significance on his thin lips."
"Mais, avant d’obtenir de Renée la cession de sa part de propriété, il eut la prudence d’aller tâter Larsonneau sur les intentions de chantage qu’il avait flairées en lui. Son instinct le sauva, en cette circonstance. L’agent d’expropriation avait cru, de son côté, que le fruit était mûr et qu’il pouvait le cueillir. Lorsque Saccard entra dans le cabinet de la rue de Rivoli, il trouva son compère bouleversé, donnant les signes du plus violent désespoir.","But, before obtaining from Renée the transfer of her share of the property, he had the prudence to go and test Larsonneau on the intentions of blackmail which he had scented in him.

"— Vous savez, ma chère amie, que je n’ai pas l’habitude d’éplucher vos dépenses. Je ne dis pas que certains détails de ce mémoire ne m’aient point un peu surpris. Ainsi, par exemple, je vois ici, à la seconde page : « Robe de bal : étoffe 70 fr. ; façon, 600 fr. ; argent prêté, 5 000 fr. ; eau du docteur Pierre, 6 fr. ». Voilà une robe de soixante-dix francs qui monte bien haut… Mais vous savez que je comprends toutes les faiblesses. Votre note est de cent trente-six mille francs, et vous avez été presque sage, relativement, je veux dire… Seulement, je le répète, je ne puis payer, je suis gêné.","“You know, my dear, that I am not in the habit of going over your expenses. I am not saying that certain details of this memoir did not surprise me a little. So, for example, I see here, on the second page: “Ball dress: fabric 70 fr. ; way, 600 fr. ; money lent, 5,000 fr. ; water from doctor Pierre, 6 fr. "". Here is a seventy-franc dress that rises very high... But you know that I understand all the weaknesses. Your bill is one hundred and thirty-six thousand francs, and you were almost wise, relatively, I mean… Only, I repeat, I cannot pay, I am embarrassed.","Smiling, he resumed his speech: “You know, my dear, I’m not in the habit of going over your expenses, but I must say I was rather taken aback by certain items in this bill. For instance, here on page two, I see: ‘Ball gown: fabric, 70 fr.; tailoring, 600 fr.; money lent, 5,000 fr.; eau du Dr. Pierre, 6 fr.’ That’s quite a lot for a seventy-franc dress. . . . But you know I understand all these foibles. Your bill comes to 136,000 francs, and you’ve restrained yourself, almost, relatively speaking, I mean. . . . But I repeat, I cannot pay, I’m strapped at the moment.”","‘You know, my dear, I’m not in the habit of criticizing your purchases, though I must say that some items here surprised me somewhat.

That seems rather expensive for a seventy-franc dress. But as you know, I understand every kind of weakness. Your bill comes to a hundred and thirty-six thousand francs, and you have been almost moderate, comparatively speaking. But, as I say, I can’t pay it, I’m short of money.’"

Il avait, en effet, entendu la conversation de son père et de Larsonneau. Les deux complices lui paraissaient de rudes gaillards. Encore vexé de la trahison de Renée, il goûtait une joie lâche à apprendre le vol dont elle allait être la victime. Ça le vengeait un peu.

"Il semblait véritablement ému. Il enfonça les pincettes entre les bûches, alluma des fusées d’étincelles. Renée se rappela l’allure inquiète qu’il avait depuis quelque temps.

Il habitait un hôtel de deux millions, il vivait sur le pied d’une dotation de prince, et certains matins il n’avait pas mille francs dans sa caisse. Ses dépenses ne paraissaient pas diminuer. Il vivait sur la dette, parmi un peuple de créanciers qui engloutissaient au jour le jour les bénéfices scandaleux qu’il réalisait dans certaines affaires. Pendant ce temps, au même moment, des sociétés s’écroulaient sous lui, de nouveaux trous se creusaient plus profonds, par-dessus lesquels il sautait, ne pouvant les combler. Il marchait ainsi sur un terrain miné, dans une crise continuelle, soldant des notes de cinquante mille francs et ne payant pas les gages de son cocher, marchant toujours avec un aplomb de plus en plus royal, vidant avec plus de rage sur Paris sa caisse vide, d’où le fleuve d’or aux sources légendaires continuait à sortir.","He seemed genuinely moved. He thrust the tweezers between the logs, lit flares of sparks. Renee remembered the worried look he had had for some time. But she could not descend into the astonishing truth. Saccard had arrived at a daily tour de force.

He lived on debt, among a people of creditors who gobbled up day by day the scandalous profits he made in certain businesses. Meanwhile, at the same time, societies were collapsing beneath him, new, deeper holes were being dug, over which he was jumping, unable to fill them. He thus walked on a mined ground, in a continual crisis, paying bills of fifty thousand francs and not paying his coachman's wages, always walking with more and more regal aplomb, emptying his cash box on Paris with more rage. void, from which the river of gold with legendary springs continued to issue.","He seemed genuinely wrought up. He poked the tongs into the pile of logs, sending sparks shooting out like fireworks.

He lived in a house worth two million francs, on a princely allowance, yet some mornings he didn’t have a thousand francs in his safe. His expenses did not appear to be diminishing. He survived on debt, surrounded by a horde of creditors who from one day to the next devoured the scandalous profits he realized on certain of his dealings. Meanwhile, companies were collapsing under him, and deeper holes were opening up beneath his feet—holes that he leapt over because he could not fill them. Thus he was threading his way through a minefield in a state of continual crisis, redeeming notes of 50,000 francs yet not paying his coachman’s wages, affecting an ever more regal self-assurance, and whipping himself into an ever more furious rage as he drew upon mythical sources to make his empty cash box pour forth unending rivers of cash, with which he inundated Paris.","He seemed genuinely upset.

He did not seem to spend any less. He lived on debt among an army of creditors who swallowed up each day the scandalous profits he made from his transactions.

Even Madame Michelin passed by, ensconced in a brougham; the pretty brunette had been on a visit to Monsieur Hupel de la Noue’s departmental town, and on her return she had appeared in the Bois in this brougham, to which she hoped soon to add an open carriage. Renée also saw the Marquise d’Espanet and Madame Haffner, the inseparables, hidden beneath their sunshades, stretched out side by side, laughing lovingly into each other’s eyes."

"À ce moment, la calèche sortit du Bois. L’avenue de l’Impératrice[11] s’allongeait toute droite dans le crépuscule, avec les deux lignes vertes de ses barrières de bois peint, qui allaient se toucher à l’horizon. Dans la contre-allée réservée aux cavaliers, un cheval blanc, au loin, faisait une tache claire trouant l’ombre grise. Il y avait, de l’autre côté, le long de la chaussée, çà et là, des promeneurs attardés, des groupes de points noirs, se dirigeant doucement vers Paris. Et tout en haut, au bout de la traînée grouillante et confuse des voitures, l’Arc-de-Triomphe, posé de biais, blanchissait sur un vaste pan de ciel couleur de suie.","At this moment the carriage left the Bois.

"Saccard, resté seul, alla appuyer son front contre les vitres glacées. Il s’oublia jusqu’à battre la retraite sur le verre, du bout des doigts. Mais il faisait une nuit si noire, les ténèbres au-dehors s’entassaient en masses si étranges, qu’il éprouva un malaise, et machinalement il revint dans la pièce où Angèle se mourait. Il l’avait oubliée, il éprouva une secousse terrible en la retrouvant levée à demi sur ses oreillers ; elle avait les yeux grands ouverts, un flot de vie semblait être remonté à ses joues et à ses lèvres. La petite Clotilde, tenant toujours sa poupée, était assise sur le bord de la couche ; dès que son père avait eu le dos tourné, elle s’était vite glissée dans cette chambre, dont on l’avait écartée, et où la ramenaient ses curiosités joyeuses d’enfant. Saccard, la tête pleine de l’histoire de sa sœur, vit son rêve à terre. Une affreuse pensée dut luire dans ses yeux. Angèle, prise d’épouvante, voulut se jeter au fond du lit, contre le mur ; mais la mort venait, ce réveil dans l’agonie était la clarté suprême de la lampe qui s’éteint. La moribonde ne put bouger ; elle s’affaissa, elle continua de tenir ses yeux grands ouverts sur son mari, comme pour surveiller ses mouvements. Saccard, qui avait cru à quelque résurrection diabolique, inventée par le destin pour le clouer dans la misère, se rassura en voyant que la malheureuse n’avait pas une heure à vivre. Il n’éprouva plus qu’un malaise intolérable. Les yeux d’Angèle disaient qu’elle avait entendu la conversation de son mari avec Mme Sidonie, et qu’elle craignait qu’il ne l’étranglât, si elle ne mourait pas assez vite. Et il y avait encore, dans ses yeux, l’horrible étonnement d’une nature douce et inoffensive s’apercevant, à la dernière heure, des infamies de ce monde, frissonnant à la pensée des longues années passées côte à côte avec un bandit. Peu à peu, son regard devint plus doux ; elle n’eut plus peur, elle dut excuser ce misérable, en songeant à la lutte acharnée qu’il livrait depuis si longtemps à la fortune.","Saccard, left alone, leaned his forehead against the icy panes. He forgot himself until he beat a retreat on the glass, with his fingertips. But it was such a dark night, the darkness outside piled up in such strange masses, that he felt uneasy, and mechanically he returned to the room where Angèle was dying. He had forgotten her, he felt a terrible shock on finding her half-raised on her pillows; her eyes were wide open, a flood of life seemed to have risen to her cheeks and to her lips. Little Clotilde, still holding her doll, was seated on the edge of the couch; as soon as her father had his back turned, she had quickly slipped into this room, from which she had been removed, and where her joyful childish curiosity brought her back. Saccard, his head full of his sister's story, is living his dream on land. A dreadful thought must have flashed in his eyes. Angèle, terrified, wanted to throw herself at the bottom of the bed, against the wall; but death was coming, this awakening in agony was the supreme brightness of the extinguishing lamp. The dying woman could not move; she sagged, she continued to keep her eyes wide open on her husband, as if to watch his movements. Saccard, who had believed in some diabolical resurrection, invented by fate to nail him to misery, was reassured on seeing that the unfortunate woman had not an hour to live. He only felt intolerable discomfort. Angèle's eyes told that she had overheard her husband's conversation with Madame Sidonie, and that she feared he would strangle her if she did not die soon enough. And there was still, in his eyes, the horrible astonishment of a gentle and harmless nature realizing, at the last hour, the infamies of this world, shuddering at the thought of the long years spent side by side with a bandit. . Little by little, his gaze became softer; she was no longer afraid, she had to excuse this wretch, thinking of the bitter struggle he had been waging for so long against fortune.","Saccard, left alone, went to the window and leaned his forehead against the frosted pane. Unconsciously he drummed the glass with his fingertips. But the night was so dark, the shadows outside hulked in such peculiar shapes, that he felt ill at ease and unthinkingly returned to the room in which Angèle lay dying. He had forgotten her, and it came as a horrible shock to find her sitting propped up against the pillows. Her eyes were wide open, and life seemed to have flooded back into her cheeks and lips. Little Clotilde, still clutching her doll, had sat down on the edge of the bed. The moment her father’s back was turned, she had hastily slipped into the bedroom from which she had been banished earlier, drawn there by the childish curiosity that was the source of all her joy. Saccard, his head still filled with his sister’s story, saw his dream dashed. A dreadful thought must have glared in his eyes. Angèle, seized by terror, tried to shrink back into the bed, pressing herself against the wall; but death had arrived, and this awakening in the throes of agony was only the final flaring up of the lamp before it went out for good. The dying woman could not move. She collapsed, still staring at her husband with wide-open eyes, as if to follow his movements. Saccard, who for a moment thought that fate had contrived some diabolical resurrection in order to keep him mired in misery, felt reassured on seeing that the wretched woman would be dead within the hour. Now all he felt was an intolerable malaise. Angèle’s eyes told him that she had overheard his conversation with Mme Sidonie and was afraid he would strangle her if she did not die quickly enough. Her eyes also expressed the horrified amazement of a sweet and inoffensive nature in its final hour recognizing the world’s infamy and shuddering at the thought of having spent long years at the side of a bandit. Little by little her eyes softened. She was no longer afraid, and she must have taken her wretched husband’s long and unremitting struggle against fate as the basis of an excuse.","Left alone, Saccard went to the window and pressed his forehead against the icy panes. He forgot himself so far as to beat a tattoo with his fingers on the glass. But the night was so black, the darkness outside hung in such strange masses, that he began to feel uneasy and returned to the room where Angèle lay dying. He had forgotten her, and received a terrible shock on finding her half raised up on her pillows; her eyes were wide open, a flush of life seemed to have returned to her cheeks and lips. Little Clotilde, still nursing her doll, was sitting on the edge of the bed; as soon as her father’s back was turned, she had quickly slipped back into the room from which she had been removed and to which all her happy childish curiosity attracted her. Saccard, his head full of his sister’s proposal, saw his dream dashed. A hideous thought must have shone from his eyes. Angèle, terrified, tried to throw herself back in the bed, against the wall; but death was at hand, this awakening in agony was the last flicker of the lamp. The dying woman was unable to move; she sank back, keeping her eyes fixed on her husband, as if to watch his every movement. Saccard, who had dreaded a resurrection, a devil’s device of destiny to keep him in penury, was relieved to see that the wretched woman had not an hour to live. He now felt nothing but deep anxiety. Angèle’s eyes told him that she had overheard his conversation with Madame Sidonie, and that she was afraid he would strangle her if she did not die quickly enough. Her eyes also betrayed the terrified amazement of a sweet and inoffensive nature that discovers at the last moment the infamy of this world, and shudders at the thought of the many years spent living with a thief. Slowly her gaze softened; she was no longer afraid, she seemed to find an excuse for the wretch, as she thought of the desperate struggle he had so long maintained against Fate."

"Larsonneau était devenu un viveur élégant, bien ganté, avec du linge éblouissant et des cravates étonnantes. Il avait, pour faire ses courses, un tilbury fin comme une œuvre d’horlogerie, très haut de siège, et qu’il conduisait lui-même. Ses bureaux de la rue de Rivoli étaient une enfilade de pièces somptueuses, où l’on ne voyait pas le moindre carton, la moindre paperasse. Ses employés écrivaient sur des tables de poirier noirci, marquetées, ornées de cuivres ciselés. Il prenait le titre d’agent d’expropriation, un métier nouveau que les travaux de Paris avaient créé. Ses attaches avec l’Hôtel de Ville le renseignaient à l’avance sur le percement des voies nouvelles. Quand il était parvenu à se faire communiquer, par un agent voyer, le tracé d’un boulevard, il allait offrir ses services aux propriétaires menacés. Et il faisait valoir ses petits moyens pour grossir l’indemnité, en agissant avant le décret d’utilité publique. Dès qu’un propriétaire acceptait ses offres, il prenait tous les frais à sa charge, dressait un plan de la propriété, écrivait un mémoire, suivait l’affaire devant le tribunal, payait un avocat, moyennant un tant pour cent sur la différence entre l’offre de la Ville et l’indemnité accordée par le jury. Mais à cette besogne à peu près avouable, il en joignait plusieurs autres. Il prêtait surtout à usure. Ce n’était plus l’usurier de la vieille école, déguenillé, malpropre, aux yeux blancs et muets comme des pièces de cent sous, aux lèvres pâles et serrées comme les cordons d’une bourse. Lui, souriait, avait des œillades charmantes, se faisait habiller chez Dusautoy, allait déjeuner chez Brébant avec sa victime, qu’il appelait « Mon bon », en lui offrant des havanes au dessert. Au fond, dans ses gilets qui le pinçaient à la taille, Larsonneau était un terrible monsieur qui aurait poursuivi le paiement d’un billet jusqu’au suicide du signataire, sans rien perdre de son amabilité.","Larsonneau had become an elegant, well-gloved viveur, with dazzling linen and astonishing ties. For shopping he had a tilbury as fine as a clockwork, with a very high seat, and which he drove himself. His offices in the rue de Rivoli were a row of sumptuous rooms, where one did not see the slightest card, the slightest paperwork. His employees wrote on tables of blackened pearwood, inlaid, decorated with chiselled brass. He took the title of agent of expropriation, a new profession which the works of Paris had created. His ties with the Hôtel de Ville informed him in advance of the opening of new roads. When he had managed to get the route of a boulevard communicated to him by a voyer agent, he went to offer his services to the threatened owners. And he used his small means to increase the indemnity, by acting before the decree of public utility. As soon as an owner accepted his offers, he took all the costs, drew up a plan of the property, wrote a memorandum, took the case to court, paid a lawyer, for a percentage on the difference between the City's offer and the compensation awarded by the jury. But to this more or less avowable task he added several others. He mainly lent usury. He was no longer the usurer of the old school, ragged and unclean, with eyes white and dumb as five-franc pieces, and lips pale and tight like the strings of a purse. He smiled, had charming glances, got dressed at Dusautoy's, went to lunch at Brébant's with his victim, whom he called ""Mon bon"", offering him Havana cigars for dessert. Basically, in his waistcoats which pinched him at the waist, Larsonneau was a terrible gentleman who would have followed the payment of a note until the suicide of the signatory, without losing any of his amiability.","Larsonneau had become an elegant man about town, who wore fine gloves, dazzling linen, and astonishing ties. To run his errands he had a tilbury as finely tuned as a piece of clockwork, with a high seat on which he sat and drove himself around town. His offices on the rue de Rivoli comprised a suite of sumptuous rooms in which not a single file folder or scrap of paper was to be seen. His clerks wrote on tables of stained pear-wood, inlaid with marquetry and trimmed with chased brass. He had assumed the title of “expropriation agent,” a new profession that the public works of the city of Paris had called into being. His city hall connections yielded him advance information about the routing of new thoroughfares. When he learned the route of a proposed boulevard from one of the surveyors, he offered his services to the threatened landowners. Before the eminent domain decree was issued, he persuaded them to take certain steps to increase their indemnities. When a landowner accepted his proposal, he assumed all the costs himself, had a plan of the property drawn up, shepherded the case through the courts, and paid a lawyer in exchange for a percentage of the difference between the city’s initial offer and the indemnity finally awarded by the jury. In addition to this almost respectable activity, however, he was involved in several other lines of work. In particular, he lent money at usurious rates of interest. He was not a usurer of the old school—shabbily dressed, dirty, with blank eyes as expressionless as a five-franc piece and pale lips drawn as tightly as the strings of a purse. He smiled and darted charming glances here and there, had his suits made by Dusautoy, and lunched at Brébant’s with his victim, whom he called “my good fellow” and plied with Havana cigars over dessert. In fact, despite his penchant for wearing jackets cut narrowly at the waist, Larsonneau was a frightful fellow who, without perceptible change in his friendly demeanor, would hound a man for payment of a promissory note until he’d driven the hapless debtor to suicide.","Larsonneau had become an elegant man-about-town, well-gloved, with dazzling linen and amazing cravats. To go on his errands he had a tilbury as light as a piece of clockwork, with a very high seat, and which he drove himself.

His connection with the Hôtel de Ville enabled him to receive advance information about the cutting of any new boulevard. When he had succeeded in learning the plan for a boulevard from one of the surveyors, he went and offered his services to the landlords who would be affected. He turned his little plan for increasing the compensation to account by acting before the decree of public utility was issued. As soon as the landlords accepted his proposals, he took all the expenses on himself, drew up a plan of the property, wrote a memorandum, followed up the case before the court, and paid a lawyer, all for a percentage of the difference between the City’s offer and the compensation awarded by the Authority. But to this almost justifiable form of business he added several others. He lent money at interest. He was not a usurer of the old school, ragged and dirty, with eyes pale and expressionless as five-franc pieces, and lips white and drawn together like purse-strings. He was jovial, had a charming way of ogling the ladies, bought his clothes at Dusautoy’s,* lunched at Brébant’s with his victim, whom he called ‘old man’, and offered him Havanas at dessert. In reality, beneath his waistcoats tightly buckled round his waist, Larsonneau was a terrible gentleman; he would have insisted on the payment of a promissory note to the point of driving the creditor to suicide, and this without losing a grain of his amiability."
"Mais un des fidèles de Mme Sidonie fut Maxime. Dès quinze ans, il allait rôder chez sa tante, flairant les gants oubliés qu’il rencontrait sur les meubles. Celle-ci, qui détestait les situations franches, et qui n’avouait jamais ses complaisances, finit par lui prêter les clefs de son appartement, certains jours, disant qu’elle resterait jusqu’au lendemain à la campagne.","But one of Madame Sidonie's followers was Maxime. From the age of fifteen, he went prowling around his aunt's house, sniffing out the forgotten gloves he encountered on the furniture.

By the age of fifteen he was prowling around his aunt’s house, sniffing at gloves he found lying forgotten on the furniture.

"En haut, devant les mansardes, le toit s’interrompait, la gouttière continuait seule son chemin pour conduire les eaux de pluie aux tuyaux de descente.

This facade, with its venerable air, its bourgeois severity, slept solemnly in the contemplation of the neighborhood, in the silence of the street which cars hardly disturbed.","Above, the line of the roof was broken by dormers, leaving the gutters to continue by themselves to funnel rainwater into the downspouts.

This façade, with its venerable air, its bourgeois severity, slumbered solemnly in this neighborhood of dignified repose and silent streets seldom disturbed by the clatter of carriages.","At the top the roof was interrupted by the dormers, and the gutter alone continued its course so as to discharge the rainwater into the down-pipes.

"Quand elle rouvrit les yeux, elle s’approcha de la glace, se regarda encore, s’examina de près. Elle était finie. Elle se vit morte. Toute sa face lui disait que le craquement cérébral s’achevait. Maxime, cette perversion dernière de ses sens, avait terminé son œuvre, épuisé sa chair, détraqué son intelligence. Elle n’avait plus de joies à goûter, plus d’espérances de réveil. À cette pensée, une colère fauve se ralluma en elle. Et, dans une crise dernière de désir, elle rêva de reprendre sa proie, d’agoniser aux bras de Maxime et de l’emporter avec elle. Louise ne pouvait l’épouser ; Louise savait bien qu’il n’était pas à elle, puisqu’elle les avait vus s’embrasser sur les lèvres.

"Il la tenait toujours, et elle donnait de petites secousses avec ses poignets pour se dégager. Ils avaient des yeux qu’ils ne se connaissaient pas, un long sourire contraint et un peu honteux.

"Elle accepta. Son régal de femme curieuse tournait mal, et elle se désespérait de rentrer ainsi avec une illusion de moins et un commencement de migraine. Elle avait cru longtemps qu’un bal d’actrices était drôle à mourir. Le printemps, comme il arrive parfois dans les derniers jours d’octobre, semblait être revenu ; la nuit avait des tiédeurs de mai, et les quelques frissons froids qui passaient, mettaient dans l’air une gaieté de plus. Renée, la tête à la portière, resta silencieuse, regardant la foule, les cafés, les restaurants, dont la file interminable courait devant elle. Elle était devenue toute sérieuse, perdue au fond de ces vagues souhaits dont s’emplissent les rêveries de femmes. Ce large trottoir que balayaient les robes des filles, et où les bottes des hommes sonnaient avec des familiarités particulières, cet asphalte gris où lui semblait passer le galop des plaisirs et des amours faciles, réveillaient ses désirs endormis, lui faisaient oublier ce bal idiot dont elle sortait, pour lui laisser entrevoir d’autres joies de plus haut goût. Aux fenêtres des cabinets de Brébant[30] , elle aperçut des ombres de femmes sur la blancheur des rideaux. Et Maxime lui conta une histoire très risquée, d’un mari trompé qui avait ainsi surpris, sur un rideau, l’ombre de sa femme en flagrant délit avec l’ombre d’un amant. Elle l’écoutait à peine. Lui, s’égaya, finit par lui prendre les mains, par la taquiner, en lui parlant de ce pauvre M. de Mussy.","She accepted. Her treat as a curious woman was going badly, and she was in despair at returning like this with one less illusion and the beginning of a migraine. She had long believed that an actresses' ball was fun to die for. Spring, as it sometimes happens in the last days of October, seemed to have returned; the night had the warmth of May, and the few cold shivers that passed put an additional gaiety in the air. Renée, her head at the door, remained silent, gazing at the crowd, the cafes, the restaurants, the endless line of which raced past her. She had become very serious, lost in the depths of those vague wishes which fill women's daydreams. This wide pavement swept by the dresses of the girls, and where the boots of the men rang with particular familiarities, this gray asphalt where he seemed to pass the gallop of pleasures and easy loves, awakened his sleeping desires, made him forget this idiotic ball whose she would go out, to give him a glimpse of other pleasures of higher taste. At the windows of the cabinets of Brébant[30] she perceived the shadows of women against the whiteness of the curtains. And Maxime told him a very risky story, of a deceived husband who had thus surprised, on a curtain, the shadow of his wife in flagrante delicto with the shadow of a lover. She was barely listening to him. He became more cheerful, ended by taking her hands, teasing her, talking to her about poor M. de Mussy.","She agreed. The evening, intended to be a feast to feed a woman’s curiosity, was not going as planned, and she hated the idea of returning home shorn of one more illusion and with a migraine coming on. It had long been a fantasy of hers that an actress’s ball had to be the most amusing thing in the world. As sometimes happens in the final days of October, spring seemed to have returned. The night was as warm as an evening in May, and the occasional chill breeze only added to the gaiety in the air. Renée, lying with her head against the carriage door, remained silent, staring at the crowd, the cafés, and the restaurants, which stretched out before her in an endless line. She had become quite serious, absorbed in a typical woman’s daydream filled with vague longings. The dresses of the prostitutes swept over the wide sidewalk, and the men’s boots struck the pavement with distinct familiarity; easy pleasures and facile loves seemed to gallop along the gray asphalt. And that sidewalk, that asphalt, awakened dormant desires in her, made her forget the idiotic ball she had just left and allowed her to glimpse other, more savory enjoyments. In the windows of the private rooms at Brébant’s she saw women silhouetted against the whiteness of the curtains. Maxime told her a very naughty story about a deceived husband who had caught the silhouette of his wife on a curtain in the act of making love to the silhouette of a man. She was barely listening. He cheered up, however, and after a while took her hands and teased her by talking about poor M. de Mussy.","She agreed. Her orgy of feminine curiosity was turning out badly, and she hated the idea of returning home disillusioned and with the beginnings of a headache. She had long imagined that an actresses’ ball would be great fun. There seemed to be a return of spring, as happens sometimes in the last days of October; the night had a May warmth, and the occasional cool breeze added to the gaiety of the atmosphere. Renée, with her head at the window, remained silent, looking at the crowd, the cafés, and the restaurants as they scudded past.

At the windows of the private rooms at Brébant’s,* she saw the shadows of women on the white curtains. Maxime told her a very salacious story, of a husband who had noticed, on a curtain, the shadows of his wife and her lover in the act. She hardly listened. But he grew more excited, and ended by taking her hands and teasing her about poor Monsieur de Mussy."

"Alors commença, pour le ménage, la vie monotone des petits employés. Aristide et sa femme reprirent leurs habitudes de Plassans. Seulement, ils tombaient d’un rêve de fortune subite, et leur vie mesquine leur pesait davantage, depuis qu’ils la regardaient comme un temps d’épreuve dont ils ne pouvaient fixer la durée. Être pauvre à Paris, c’est être pauvre deux fois. Angèle acceptait la misère avec cette mollesse de femme chlorotique ; elle passait les journées dans sa cuisine, ou bien couchée à terre, jouant avec sa fille, ne se lamentant qu’à la dernière pièce de vingt sous. Mais Aristide frémissait de rage dans cette pauvreté, dans cette existence étroite, où il tournait comme une bête enfermée.","Then began, for the household, the monotonous life of the little employees. Aristide and his wife resumed their habits at Plassans.

To be poor in Paris is to be poor twice. Angèle accepted misery with the softness of a chlorotic woman; she passed the days in her kitchen, or else lying on the ground, playing with her daughter, complaining only at the last twenty-sou piece. But Aristide quivered with rage in this poverty, in this narrow existence, in which he turned like an imprisoned animal.","Thus began, for Saccard and his wife, the monotonous life of the minor bureaucrat. The couple reverted to the routine they had adopted in Plassans, only now they were putting aside their dreams of sudden fortune, and their shabby life seemed more oppressive because they saw it as an ordeal whose duration could not be predicted. To be poor in Paris is to be poor twice over. Angèle accepted misery with the passivity of the anemic woman she was. She spent her days either in the kitchen or lying on the floor playing with her daughter, not feeling sorry for herself until the last franc was gone from the kitty. But Aristide quivered with rage over this poverty, this cramped existence, in which he prowled endlessly like a caged beast.","The household now settled into the monotonous life of a minor clerk. Aristide and his wife resumed their Plassans habits. Their dream of immediate wealth had evaporated, and their poverty-stricken existence seemed all the more oppressive to them because they had come to regard it as a probationary period of indeterminate length. To be poor in Paris is to be doubly poor. Angèle accepted penury with dull passivity; she spent her days in the kitchen, or lying on the floor playing with her daughter, never complaining until their money ran out. But Aristide quivered with rage at this state of poverty, at this pinched existence, in which he paced about like a caged animal."

"Ce fut Saccard qui rédigea le rapport, et le jury accorda trois millions. Le spéculateur était aux abois, il n’aurait pu attendre un mois de plus. Cet argent le sauvait de la ruine, et même un peu de la cour d’assises.

Il combla d’autres trous, se lança dans des sociétés nouvelles, assourdit Paris du bruit de ces vrais écus qu’il jetait à la pelle sur les tablettes de son armoire de fer. Le fleuve d’or avait enfin des sources. Mais ce n’était pas encore là une fortune solide, endiguée, coulant d’un jet égal et continu. Saccard, sauvé d’une crise, se trouvait misérable avec les miettes de ses trois millions, disait naïvement qu’il était encore trop pauvre, qu’il ne pouvait s’arrêter.

He filled in other holes, threw himself into new societies, deafened Paris with the noise of these real crowns which he shoveled onto the shelves of his iron cupboard. The river of gold finally had sources. But it was not yet a solid, dammed fortune, flowing with an even and continuous stream. Saccard, saved from a crisis, found himself miserable with the crumbs of his three millions, said naively that he was still too poor, that he could not stop. And soon the ground creaked again under his feet.","Saccard drew up the report, and the jury awarded an indemnity of three million francs. The speculator had his back to the wall; he couldn’t have held out another month. This money saved him from ruin and perhaps even from the criminal courts. He paid 500,000 francs of the million he owed his upholsterer and contractor on the Parc Monceau house. He attended to other trouble spots, plunged into new ventures, and deafened Paris with the sound of the very real gold coins that he loaded into his safe by the shovelful. The river of gold at last had a source. But it was not yet a solid, entrenched fortune flowing at an even and steady rate. Saved from bankruptcy, Saccard considered himself a beggar reduced to living on the crumbs from his three million francs; naïvely he told himself that he was still too poor, that he could not stop. And soon the ground had opened up yet again beneath his feet.","Saccard drew up the report, and the Authority granted three million francs. The speculator was in dire straits, he could not have waited another month. This money saved him from ruin and even from the dock. He paid five hundred thousand francs towards the million he owed his upholsterer and his builder for the house in the Parc Monceau. He stopped up other holes, launched new companies, deafened Paris with the sound of the real crown pieces he shovelled out onto the shelves of his iron safe. The golden stream had a source at last. But it was not yet a solid, established fortune, flowing with an even, continuous current. Saccard, saved from a crisis, thought himself a beggar with the crumbs from his three million, and said frankly that he was still too poor, that he could not stop; and soon the ground appeared once more to be giving way under his feet."
"— L’administration, dit-il, a rencontré tant de dévouements ! Tout le monde a voulu contribuer à la grande œuvre. Sans les riches compagnies qui lui sont venues en aide, la Ville n’aurait jamais pu faire si bien ni si vite.","“The administration,” he said, “has met with so many devotions! Everyone wanted to contribute to the great work. Without the wealthy companies that came to its aid, the City would never have been able to do so well or so quickly.","“The government,” he said, “is fortunate to have found such dedicated partners. Everyone was eager to contribute to such a grand design. Without the aid of well-endowed companies, the city would never have been able to accomplish so much in so short a time.”","‘The Government’, he said, ‘has had such strong support. Everyone has been keen to contribute to the great project. Without the help of the wealthy companies, the city would never have made such progress.’"
Puis il emmenait la dame ou parfois allait avec elle se joindre au tapage du salon voisin.,Then he took the lady or sometimes went with her to join in the uproar of the neighboring drawing-room.,"Then he would take the lady off, or sometimes he would take her to join the boisterous crowd next door.","Then he carried the lady off, or sometimes went with her and joined the noisy company in the next room."
"Le bal fut ouvert. On avait utilisé l’estrade des tableaux vivants, en y plaçant un petit orchestre, où les cuivres dominaient ; et les bugles, les cornets à pistons, jetaient leurs notes claires dans la forêt idéale, aux arbres bleus. Ce fut d’abord un quadrille : Ah ! il a des bottes, il a des bottes, Bastien ! qui faisait alors les délices des bastringues. Ces dames dansèrent. Les polkas, les valses, les mazurkas, alternèrent avec les quadrilles. Le large balancement des couples allait et venait, emplissait la longue galerie, sautant sous le fouet des cuivres, se balançant au bercement des violons. Les costumes, ce flot de femmes de tous les pays et de toutes les époques, roulait, avec un fourmillement, une bigarrure d’étoffes vives. Le rythme, après avoir mêlé et emporté les couleurs, dans un tohu-bohu cadencé, ramenait brusquement, à certains coups d’archet, la même tunique de satin rose, le même corsage de velours bleu, à côté du même habit noir. Puis un autre coup d’archet, une sonnerie de cornets à pistons, poussaient les couples, les faisaient voyager à la file autour du salon, avec des mouvements balancés de nacelle s’en allant à la dérive, sous un souffle de vent qui a brisé l’amarre. Et toujours, sans fin, pendant des heures. Parfois, entre deux danses, une dame s’approchait d’une fenêtre, étouffant, respirant un peu d’air glacé ; un couple se reposait sur une causeuse du petit salon bouton d’or, ou descendait dans la serre, faisant doucement le tour des allées. Sous les berceaux de lianes, au fond de l’ombre tiède, où arrivaient les forte des cornets à pistons, dans les quadrilles d’Ohé ! les p’tits agneaux et de J’ai un pied qui r’mue, des jupes, dont on ne voyait que le bord, avaient des rires languissants.","The ball was opened. We had used the stage of the tableaus vivants, placing a small orchestra there, where the brass instruments dominated; and the flugelhorns, the cornets, threw their clear notes into the ideal forest, with its blue trees. It was first a quadrille: Ah! he has boots, he has boots, Bastien! which was then the delight of the bastringues. These ladies danced. Polkas, waltzes, mazurkas alternated with quadrilles. The wide swaying of the couples came and went, filled the long gallery, leaping under the whip of the brass, swaying to the rocking of the violins. The costumes, that flood of women from all countries and all eras, rolled along, with a swarming, a variegation of bright fabrics. The rhythm, after having mixed and carried away the colors, in a cadenced hustle and bustle, suddenly brought back, with certain strokes of the bow, the same pink satin tunic, the same blue velvet bodice, next to the same black coat. Then another stroke of the bow, a ringing of cornets, pushed the couples, made them travel in a file around the living room, with the swinging movements of the basket going adrift, under a breath of wind which broke the mooring. And always, without end, for hours. Sometimes, between two dances, a lady would approach a window, suffocating, breathing in a little icy air; a couple was resting on a loveseat in the little buttercup lounge, or descending into the conservatory, gently circling the aisles. Beneath the cradles of lianas, at the bottom of the warm shade, where the forte of the cornets arrived, in the quadrilles of Ohé! the little lambs and J'ai un pied qu'mue, skirts, of which you could only see the edge, had languid laughter.","The ball began. The stage used for the tableaux vivants had been pressed into service as a platform for a small orchestra in which brass dominated. Bugles and trumpets blasted their clear notes into the fantastic forest with the blue trees. The evening began with a quadrille, “Ah! il a des bottes, il a des bottes, Bastien!,” which was all the rage in dance halls at the time. The ladies danced. Polkas, waltzes, and mazurkas alternated with quadrilles. Whirling couples came and went all the way down the length of the gallery, leaping at the whip of the brass and swaying with the lullaby of the violins. This river of costumes—this torrent of women from every country and epoch— comprised a swirling tide of bright fabrics. The rhythm, after mixing these colors and sweeping them away in measured confusion, suddenly brought them back again, so that on certain strokes of the bow the same pink satin tunic or blue velvet bodice would reappear together with the same dark frock coat. Then another stroke of the bow or another blast of the trumpets would send the couples off again on yet another voyage around the drawing room, swaying like a boat adrift on the waves after the wind has broken it free from its mooring. And again, without stopping, for hours on end. Occasionally, between dances, one of the women would go over to a window, panting and gasping for a breath of cold air. Or a couple would relax on a love seat in the small buttercup salon or go out to the conservatory and stroll slowly along the paths. Beneath arbors of tropical vines, deep in the tepid shadows pierced by forte notes from the trumpets in quadrilles such as “Ohé! les p’tits agneaux” and “J’ai un pied qui r’mue,” women with listless smiles had vanished but for the hems of their skirts.","The ball began. The stage of tableaux vivants had been used to accommodate a small band, in which brass predominated; and the clear notes of the horns and cornets rang out in the ideal forest with the blue trees. First came a quadrille: ‘Ah, il a des bottes, il a des bottes, Bastien!’, which was at that time extremely popular in the dance-halls. The ladies danced. Polkas, waltzes, and mazurkas alternated with the quadrilles. The swirling couples moved backwards and forwards, filling the long gallery, bounding in response to the brass, swaying to the lullaby of the violins. The fancy dresses, the cavalcade of women from every country and every period, rocked to and fro in a swarming medley of bright materials. After mingling and carrying off the colours in cadenced confusion, the rhythm, at certain strokes of the bow, abruptly brought back the same pink satin tunic, the same blue velvet bodice, side by side with the same dress-coat. Then another stroke of the bows and blast of the cornets pushed the couples on, made them travel in single file round the drawing room, with the swaying motion of a rowing-boat with a snapped painter drifting in the wind. And so on, endlessly, for hours. Sometimes, between two dances, a lady went to a window, suffocating, to breathe in a little of the fresh air; couples rested on a sofa in the little buttercup drawing room, or went into the hothouse, strolling slowly round the pathways. Skirts, their edges alone visible, laughed languidly under the arbours of creepers, in the depths of the warm shadow, where the forte notes of the cornets penetrated during the quadrilles of ‘Ohé les p’tits agneaux!’ and ‘J’ai un pied qui r’mue!’"

"Maxime resta languissant. La chaleur était suffocante, une chaleur sombre, qui ne tombait pas du ciel en pluie de feu, mais qui traînait à terre, ainsi qu’une exhalaison malsaine, et dont la buée montait, pareille à un nuage chargé d’orage. Une humidité chaude couvrait les amants d’une rosée, d’une sueur ardente. Longtemps ils demeurèrent sans gestes et sans paroles, dans ce bain de flammes, Maxime terrassé et inerte, Renée frémissante sur ses poignets comme sur des jarrets souples et nerveux. Au-dehors, par les petites vitres de la serre, on voyait des échappées du parc Monceau, des bouquets d’arbres aux fines découpures noires, des pelouses de gazon blanches comme des lacs glacés, tout un paysage mort, dont les délicatesses et les teintes claires et unies rappelaient des coins de gravures japonaises. Et ce bout de terre brûlante, cette couche enflammée où les amants s’allongeaient, bouillait étrangement au milieu de ce grand froid muet.","Maxime remained languid. The heat was suffocating, a gloomy heat, which did not fall from the sky in a rain of fire, but which trailed on the ground, like an unhealthy exhalation, and from which the mist rose, like a cloud laden with a storm. A warm humidity covered the lovers with a dew, a burning sweat. For a long time they remained without gesture or word, in this bath of flames, Maxime overwhelmed and inert, Renee quivering on her wrists as on supple and nervous hamstrings. Outside, through the small windows of the greenhouse, one could see glimpses of Parc Monceau, clumps of trees with fine black outlines, lawns of grass as white as frozen lakes, a whole dead landscape, whose delicacies and clear, plain colors recalled the corners of Japanese engravings. And this piece of burning earth, this inflamed layer where the lovers lay, boiled strangely in the midst of this great silent cold.","Maxime continued to lie on his back. The heat was suffocating. It was a somber heat, which did not fall from heaven as a rain of fire but hung about the earth like an unhealthy exhalation, giving off a mist that rose like a storm-laden cloud.

For a long time they remained motionless and silent in this bath of flames, Maxime prostrate and inert, Renée quivering on her wrists like an animal on supple and sinewy hocks. From outside, through the small panes of the conservatory windows, came glimpses of the Parc Monceau, of clumps of trees with fine black outlines and lawns as white as frozen lakes, a whole lifeless landscape whose delicate touches and smooth, pale colors were reminiscent of Japanese engravings. And this scorching bit of earth, this blazing bed on which the lovers lay, seethed strangely amid the deep silent chill.","Maxime remained supine.

"Il dit cela tranquillement, mais elle refusa d’abord, assura que Céleste lui avait préparé une collation à l’hôtel.

"Mais la Ristori, avec ses fortes épaules secouées par les sanglots, avec sa face tragique et ses gros bras, remuait profondément Renée.

Saccard laughed ungraciously; his former partners had just realized enormous profits in an affair in which he had played the part of a dupe. As the interval wore on, admiring comments on Venus’ breasts and Echo’s costume broke into the conversation of the serious-looking gentlemen."

On the right, the copses, the low forests had ceased; the Wood had opened out into broad lawns, immense carpets of grass, planted here and there with a clump of tall trees; the green tablecloths followed each other, with light undulations, as far as the Porte de la Muette, whose low gate could be seen very far off, like a piece of black lace stretched at ground level; and on the slopes, where the undulations deepened, the grass was all blue. Renée watched with fixed eyes, as if this enlargement of the horizon, these soft meadows, soaked by the evening air, had made her feel more vividly the emptiness of her being.","Then, lips pinched, she fell silent. The line of carriages continued to move along the lake at a steady pace, sounding remarkably like a distant waterfall. Looming up on the left, between the water and the path, were small clumps of green trees with straight, slender trunks that oddly resembled a series of colonnades. The bushes and trees on the right had vanished, and the Bois now opened out into vast expanses of green, immense carpets of lawn punctuated here and there by clusters of tall trees. Gently undulating sheets of green stretched all the way to the Porte de la Muette,6 whose low gate, visible from quite a distance, resembled a piece of taut black lace stretched along the ground, and on the slopes, in the places where the undulations dipped down low, the grass had taken on a bluish tint. Renée stared straight ahead, her eyes fixed, as though this magnification of the horizon, these soft meadows moistened by the night air, had made her more acutely aware of the emptiness of her existence.","Then she sat silent, her lips tightly closed. The line of carriages was still travelling along the side of the lake, with its even trot and a noise like a distant waterfall. On the left, between the water and the roadway, rose little bushes of evergreens with thin straight stems, forming curious little clusters of pillars. On the right, the copses and low trees had come to an end; the Bois opened out into broad lawns, vast expanses of grass, with here and there a group of tall trees; the greensward ran on, with gentle undulations, to the Porte de la Muette, whose low gates, which seemed like a piece of black lace stretched along the ground, were visible in the distance; and on the slopes, in the hollows, the grass was quite blue. Renée stared blankly before her, as if this widening of the horizon, these gentle meadows, soaked in the evening air, made her feel more keenly the emptiness of her life."

"Et elle se dit qu’une seule fois elle avait lu l’avenir, le jour où, devant les ombres murmurantes du parc Monceau, la pensée que son mari la salirait et la jetterait un jour à la folie, était venue effrayer ses désirs grandissants. Ah ! que sa pauvre tête souffrait ! comme elle sentait, à cette heure, la fausseté de cette imagination, qui lui faisait croire qu’elle vivait dans une sphère bienheureuse de jouissance et d’impunité divines !

"Maxime, dans son coin, rêvait aussi avec quelque ennui. Il était fâché de l’aventure. Il s’en prenait au domino de satin noir. Avait-on jamais vu une femme se fagoter de la sorte ! On ne lui voyait pas même le cou. Il l’avait prise pour un garçon, il jouait avec elle, et ce n’était pas sa faute si le jeu était devenu sérieux. Pour sûr, il ne l’aurait pas touchée du bout des doigts, si elle avait seulement montré un coin d’épaule. Il se serait souvenu qu’elle était la femme de son père. Puis, comme il n’aimait pas les réflexions désagréables, il se pardonna. Tant pis, après tout ! il tâcherait de ne plus recommencer. C’était une bêtise.","Maxime, in his corner, was also dreaming with some boredom. He was sorry for the adventure. He attacked the black satin domino. Had we ever seen a woman faggot like this!

Surely he wouldn't have touched her with his fingertips, if she had only shown the corner of her shoulder. He would have remembered that she was his father's wife. Then, as he did not like unpleasant reflections, he forgave himself. Too bad, after all! he would try not to start again. It was stupidity.","Maxime, in his corner, was also dreaming, not without a certain irritation. The adventure had made him angry. He blamed the black satin domino.

He certainly wouldn’t have touched her with his fingertips if she’d shown even a bit of shoulder. He would have remembered that she was his father’s wife. And then, because he disliked unpleasant thoughts, he forgave himself. What did it matter in the end? He’d try not to do it again. It was just foolishness.","Maxime was also pondering things.

"Une nuit, Maxime fut si rapidement décavé chez une dame où l’on jouait souvent jusqu’au jour, qu’il éprouva une de ces colères muettes de joueur dont les poches sont vides. Il eût donné tout au monde pour pouvoir jeter encore quelques louis sur la table. Il prit son chapeau, et du pas machinal d’un homme poussé par une idée fixe, il alla au parc Monceau, ouvrit la petite grille, se trouva dans la serre. Il était plus de minuit. Renée lui avait défendu de venir, ce soir-là. Maintenant, quand elle lui fermait sa porte, elle ne cherchait même plus à trouver une explication, et lui ne songeait qu’à profiter de son jour de congé. Il ne se souvint nettement de la défense de la jeune femme que devant la porte-fenêtre du petit salon, qui était fermée. D’ordinaire, quand il devait venir, Renée tournait à l’avance l’espagnolette de cette porte.","One night Maxime was so quickly stripped at a lady's house, where they often played until daylight, that he felt one of those mute rages of a gambler whose pockets are empty.

Renee had forbidden him to come that evening. Now, when she closed her door to him, she no longer even tried to find an explanation, and he thought only of enjoying his day off. He clearly remembered the defense of the young woman only in front of the French window of the small living room, which was closed. Usually, when he was to come, Renée turned the latch of this door in advance.","One night, Maxime went to play cards at the home of a lady where the game often continued until dawn, and he was wiped out so quickly that he fell prey to the kind of silent rage that often afflicts gamblers whose pockets are empty.

He took his hat, and with the mechanical step of a man driven by an unalterable idea, he went to the Parc Monceau, opened the side gate, and found himself in the conservatory. It was past midnight. Renée had forbidden him to come that night. Now, when she shut her door to him, she no longer even tried to fob him off with an explanation, and he could think of nothing but taking advantage of his day off. He didn’t clearly remember the young woman’s warning to stay away until he was standing in front of the glass door to the small salon, which he found locked. On nights when he was expected, Renée normally left the door unlatched.","One night Maxime was so rapidly cleaned out at the house of a lady where cards were often played till dawn, that he had one of those fits of dumb anger common to the gambler whose pockets have been emptied.

Renée had told him not to come that night. When she closed her door to him now, she no longer even invented an excuse, and he thought only of making the most of his time off.

"Renée avait cédé à la secousse légère de la calèche se remettant en marche, et, laissant tomber son binocle, s’était de nouveau renversée à demi sur les coussins.

"Ce fut le lendemain que Saccard se décida à brusquer le dénouement de l’affaire de Charonne. Sa femme lui appartenait ; il venait de la sentir douce et inerte entre ses mains, comme une chose qui s’abandonne. D’autre part, le tracé du boulevard du Prince-Eugène allait être arrêté, il fallait que Renée fût dépouillée avant que l’expropriation prochaine s’ébruitât. Saccard montrait, dans toute cette affaire, un amour d’artiste ; il regardait mûrir son plan avec dévotion, tendait ses pièges avec les raffinements d’un chasseur qui met de la coquetterie à prendre galamment le gibier. C’était, chez lui, une simple satisfaction de joueur adroit, d’homme goûtant une volupté particulière au gain volé ; il voulait avoir les terrains pour un morceau de pain, quitte à donner cent mille francs de bijoux à sa femme, dans la joie du triomphe. Les opérations les plus simples se compliquaient, dès qu’il s’en occupait, devenaient des drames noirs ; il se passionnait, il aurait battu son père pour une pièce de cent sous. Et il semait ensuite l’or royalement.","It was the next day that Saccard decided to hasten the denouement of the Charonne affair. His wife belonged to him; he had just felt her soft and inert between his hands, like something giving itself up. On the other hand, the route of the Boulevard du Prince-Eugène was about to be fixed, Renée had to be stripped before the impending expropriation became known. Saccard showed, in all this affair, the love of an artist; he watched his plan ripen with devotion, set his traps with the refinements of a hunter who puts coquetry into gallantly taking game. It was, with him, the simple satisfaction of a skilful gambler, of a man enjoying a particular pleasure in stolen winnings; he wanted to have the land for a piece of bread, even if it meant giving his wife a hundred thousand francs worth of jewels, in the joy of triumph. The simplest operations became more complicated as soon as he got involved in them, becoming black dramas; he was passionate, he would have beaten his father for a hundred sous piece. And then he sowed the gold royally.","The next day, Saccard decided to force the Charonne business to a conclusion. His wife was now his. He had just held her in his hands and felt her softness, her inertness—an object that has ceased to resist. What is more, the route of the boulevard du Prince-Eugène was about to be announced, and it was essential that Renée be stripped of her title before word of the upcoming expropriation leaked out. Throughout this business, Saccard proceeded with an artist’s love of his work. He watched his plan ripen with rapt devotion and set traps with the cunning of a hunter who prides himself on his sporting approach to his prey. With him there was a simple satisfaction in playing the game well, a particular pleasure in ill-gotten gains. If he could have the land for a crust of bread, he would gladly give his wife jewels worth a hundred thousand francs in the joy of triumph. The simplest operations grew complex, turned into dark dramas, whenever he became involved. Passion took hold of him, and he would have beaten his own father to lay hands on a hundred sous. And afterwards he would have strewn the gold about with royal largesse.","The next day Saccard resolved to bring the Charonne business to a head. His wife belonged to him; he had just felt her, soft and inert in his hands, like a helpless plaything. On the other hand the precise plan for the Boulevard du Prince-Eugène was about to be settled, and it was necessary that Renée should be relieved of the land before the news broke of the imminent expropriation. Saccard put an artist’s love of his work into this piece of business; he carefully watched his plan ripen, and set his traps with the subtlety of a hunter who prides himself on the skill with which he catches his prey. In his case it was simply the self-satisfaction of an expert gamester, of a man who derives peculiar pleasure from ill-gotten gains; he wanted to buy the land for a song, and was quite ready to give his wife a hundred thousand francs’-worth of jewellery in celebration of his triumph. The simplest operations became complicated as soon as he touched them, and turned into dramas: he became quite impassioned, he would have fought with his father for a five-franc piece, and afterwards he scattered his gold like a king."

"Saccard gagna la protection de ces deux personnages, en leur rendant des services, dont il feignit habilement d’ignorer l’importance. Il mit en rapport sa sœur et le baron, alors compromis dans une histoire des moins propres. Il la conduisit chez lui, sous le prétexte de réclamer son appui en faveur de la chère femme, qui pétitionnait depuis longtemps, afin d’obtenir une fourniture de rideaux pour les Tuileries. Mais il advint, quand l’agent voyer les eut laissés ensemble, que ce fut Mme Sidonie qui promit au baron de traiter avec certaines gens, assez maladroits pour ne pas être honorés de l’amitié qu’un sénateur avait daigné témoigner à leur enfant, une petite fille d’une dizaine d’années. Saccard agit lui-même auprès de M. Toutin-Laroche ; il se ménagea une entrevue avec lui dans un corridor et mit la conversation sur le fameux Crédit viticole. Au bout de cinq minutes, le grand administrateur effaré, stupéfait des choses étonnantes qu’il entendait, prit sans façon l’employé à son bras et le retint pendant une heure dans le couloir. Saccard lui souffla des mécanismes financiers prodigieux d’ingéniosité. Quand M. Toutin-Laroche le quitta, il lui serra la main d’une façon expressive, avec un clignement d’yeux franc-maçonnique.","Saccard gained the protection of these two personages by rendering them services, the importance of which he skilfully pretended to ignore. He brought his sister into contact with the baron, who was then involved in a most unclean affair. He conducted her to his house, under the pretext of claiming his support in favor of the dear woman, who had been petitioning for a long time, in order to obtain a supply of curtains for the Tuileries. But it happened, when the agent voyer had left them together, that it was Madame Sidonie who promised the baron to deal with certain people, clumsy enough not to be honored by the friendship that a senator had deigned to show their child. , a ten-year-old girl. Saccard acts himself with Mr. Toutin-Laroche; he arranged an interview with him in a corridor and turned the conversation to the famous Credit Viticole. At the end of five minutes, the tall, bewildered administrator, amazed at the astonishing things he was hearing, casually took the clerk by his arm and kept him for an hour in the corridor. Saccard suggested to him prodigiously ingenious financial mechanisms. When Mr. Toutin-Laroche left him, he shook hands with him in an expressive way, with a Freemasonic wink.","Saccard won the protection of these two personages by doing them favors, the importance of which he shrewdly pretended not to notice. He introduced his sister to the baron, who was mixed up at the time in a most unsavory affair. He took her to the baron’s house on the pretext of soliciting his support for Mme Sidonie’s long-standing effort to obtain a contract to supply the Tuileries with draperies. After they spent some time alone together, however, it turned out that it was she who promised the baron to negotiate with certain individuals ill-mannered enough not to be honored by the friendship that a senator had deigned to show their daughter, a little girl of ten. Saccard himself took the initiative with M. Toutin-Laroche. He contrived a meeting in a corridor and turned the conversation to the much-discussed Crédit Viticole. Before five minutes had passed, the great administrator, alarmed and dumbfounded by the astonishing things he was hearing, took the clerk familiarly by the arm and kept him standing in the hallway for the next hour. Saccard whispered in his ears details of the most wonderfully ingenious financial schemes. On taking his leave, M. Toutin-Laroche squeezed the clerk’s hand in a most meaningful way and gave him a conspiratorial wink.","* Saccard secured the protection of these two gentlemen by doing them favours whose importance he cleverly pretended to ignore. He introduced his sister to the Baron when the latter was involved in a terrible scandal. He took her to see him under the pretence of seeking his support for the dear woman, who had been petitioning him for a contract to supply the Tuileries with window-curtains. But when the surveyor left them together, it was Madame Sidonie who promised the Baron that she would negotiate with certain people who were clumsy enough not to have felt honoured by the interest that a senator had condescended to take in their child, a girl of ten. Saccard took Monsieur Toutin-Laroche in hand himself; he arranged to bump into him in the corridor, and raised the topic of the famous Crédit Viticole. After five minutes the great administrator, astounded at the extraordinary things he heard, grabbed the clerk by the arm and stood talking with him for a full hour. Saccard whispered in his ear about some highly ingenious financial schemes. When Monsieur Toutin-Laroche left him, he squeezed his hand meaningfully and gave him a masonic wink."

"Une familiarité, un abandon plus grand encore, existaient entre le père et le fils. Saccard avait compris qu’un grand financier doit aimer les femmes et faire quelques folies pour elles. Il était d’amour brutal, préférait l’argent ; mais il entra dans son programme de courir les alcôves, de semer les billets de banque sur certaines cheminées, de mettre de temps à autre une fille célèbre comme une enseigne dorée à ses spéculations. Quand Maxime fut sorti du collège, ils se rencontrèrent chez les mêmes dames, et ils en rirent. Ils furent même un peu rivaux. Parfois, lorsque le jeune homme dînait à la Maison d’Or[27] , avec quelque bande tapageuse, il entendait la voix de Saccard dans un cabinet voisin.","A familiarity, an even greater abandon, existed between father and son. Saccard had understood that a great financier must love women and do something crazy for them. He was brutal in love, preferred money; but it entered into his program to roam the alcoves, to scatter bank-notes on certain chimneys, to place from time to time a famous girl as a gilded sign to his speculations. When Maxime left college, they met at the same ladies' house, and they laughed about it. They were even a little rivals. Sometimes, when the young man dined at the Maison d'Or[27], with some rowdy band, he heard Saccard's voice in a neighboring room.","A still greater familiarity and lack of restraint existed between father and son. Saccard had grasped the fact that a great financier is bound to make love to women and on occasion lose his head over them. He was brusque in love and preferred money. It was a part of his plan, however, to frequent women’s bedrooms, to strew banknotes on certain mantelpieces, and from time to time to use a celebrated prostitute as a gold-plated advertisement for one of his speculations. When Maxime left school, he and his father would occasionally run into each other at the home of the same lady, and they would laugh about it. To some extent they were even rivals. Sometimes, when the young man dined at the Maison d’Or with a noisy group of friends, he could hear Saccard’s voice in a private room nearby.","Even greater familiarity and licence existed between father and son. Saccard had realized that a great financier must love women and commit extravagances for them. He was a rough lover, and preferred money; but it became part of his programme to frequent alcoves, to scatter banknotes on certain mantelpieces, and from time to time to use a prominent courtesan as a signboard for his speculations. After Maxime had left school they used to meet in the same women’s apartments and laugh about it. They were even rivals to some extent. Occasionally, when Maxime was dining at the Maison d’Or* with some noisy crowd, he heard Saccard’s voice in an adjacent private room."
"Il parlait avec un mépris profond des impatiences d’écolier de son frère. On sentait, dans sa parole rude, des ambitions plus hautes, des désirs de puissance pure ; ce naïf appétit de l’argent devait lui paraître bourgeois et puéril. Il continua d’une voix plus douce, avec un fin sourire :","He spoke with profound contempt of his brother's schoolboy impatience. One sensed, in his rough speech, loftier ambitions, desires for pure power; this naive appetite for money must have seemed bourgeois and childish to him. He continued in a softer voice, with a thin smile:","He spoke with deep contempt for his brother’s adolescent impatience. In his gruff speech one sensed higher ambitions, a desire for pure power. Aristide’s naïve appetite for money must have struck him as bourgeois and puerile. Speaking in a gentler voice and smiling a sly smile, he went on: “Of course your attitude is excellent, and I’ll be careful not to stand in your way.","He spoke with profound contempt for his brother’s schoolboy impatience. One could feel through his harsh words a higher ambition, a desire for limitless power; Aristide’s craving for money must have seemed vulgar and puerile to him. He continued in a softer tone, with a subtle smile:"
"Comme ils sortaient, M. de Mussy entra. Il parut enchanté de rencontrer Maxime, et, sans faire attention à la femme masquée qui était avec lui :","As they were leaving, M. de Mussy entered. He seemed delighted to meet Maxime, and, ignoring the masked woman who was with him:","As they were leaving, M. de Mussy came in.

He seemed delighted to meet Maxime and, paying no attention to the masked woman beside him, murmured with a lovesick air: ‘she’ll be the death of me."
"Renée acheva machinalement les quelques gouttes de tokai qui restaient au fond de son verre. Des feux lui montaient à la face ; les petits cheveux pâles de son front et de sa nuque, rebelles, s’échappaient, comme mouillés par un souffle humide. Elle avait les lèvres et le nez amincis nerveusement, le visage muet d’un enfant qui a bu du vin pur. Si de bonnes pensées bourgeoises lui étaient venues en face des ombres du parc Monceau, ces pensées se noyaient, à cette heure, dans l’excitation des mets, des vins, des lumières, de ce milieu troublant où passaient des haleines et des gaietés chaudes. Elle n’échangeait plus de tranquilles sourires avec sa sœur Christine et sa tante Élisabeth, modestes toutes deux, s’effaçant, parlant à peine. Elle avait, d’un regard dur, fait baisser les yeux du pauvre M. de Mussy. Dans son apparente distraction, bien qu’elle évitât maintenant de se tourner, appuyée contre le dossier de sa chaise, où le satin de son corsage craquait doucement, elle laissait échapper un imperceptible frisson des épaules, à chaque nouvel éclat de rire qui lui venait du coin où Maxime et Louise plaisantaient, toujours aussi haut, dans le bruit mourant des conversations.","Renée mechanically finished off the few drops of tokai that remained at the bottom of her glass. Fires mounted in his face; the little pale hair on her forehead and her neck, rebellious, escaped, as if wet with a damp breath. Her lips and nose thinned nervously, the mute face of a child who has drunk pure wine. If good bourgeois thoughts had come to him in front of the shadows of the Parc Monceau, these thoughts were drowned, at this hour, in the excitement of the food, the wines, the lights, of this disturbing environment where breaths and warm gaiety passed. . She no longer exchanged quiet smiles with her sister Christine and her aunt Elisabeth, both modest, stepping aside, barely speaking. She had, with a hard look, made poor M. de Mussy lower his eyes. In her apparent distraction, although she now avoided turning, leaning against the back of her chair, where the satin of her bodice creaked gently, she let out an imperceptible shudder from her shoulders, with each new burst of laughter that came to her. from the corner where Maxime and Louise were joking, still just as loud, in the dying noise of conversations.","Renée mechanically finished off the few drops of Tokay that remained in the bottom of her glass. Her face tingled. The short, pale hairs on her forehead and the back of her neck stood out in unruly display as if moistened by a humid breeze. Her lips and nose were pinched by nervous tension, and her face was as expressionless as that of a child who has drunk undiluted wine. If her mind had been filled with nice bourgeois thoughts while staring into the shadows of the Parc Monceau, those thoughts were now drowned out by the excitement induced by the food, wine, and light and the stimuli of unsettling surroundings rife with warm exhalations and raucous laughter. She was no longer exchanging quiet smiles with her sister Christine and Aunt Elisabeth—both modest, self-effacing women not much given to talk. With a sharp glance she had forced poor M. de Mussy to lower his eyes. Though still apparently lost in thought, she leaned against the back of her chair, causing the satin of her bodice to crinkle softly, and although she avoided turning toward the corner of the table where Maxime and Louise continued to banter as loudly as ever despite the waning buzz of conversation, her shoulders quivered imperceptibly with each fresh burst of laughter from their direction.","Renée mechanically finished the few drops of Tokay at the bottom of her glass. Her face tingled, her lips and nose were nervously contracted; she had the blank expression of a child who has drunk neat wine.

She no longer exchanged discreet smiles with her sister Christine and her Aunt Élisabeth, both of them modest and retiring, barely uttering a word. With a stony glance she had made poor Monsieur de Mussy lower his eyes. Though her thoughts seemed elsewhere, and she carefully refrained from turning round, leaning back in her chair, against which the satin of her bodice rustled gently, her shoulders betrayed a slight tremor with each fresh burst of laughter from the corner where Maxime and Louise were still making merry, as loudly as ever, amid the dying buzz of conversation."
"Dans l’écroulement de ses tendresses, il vint un moment où Renée n’eut plus que sa femme de chambre à aimer. Elle s’était prise peu à peu d’une affection maternelle pour Céleste. Peut-être cette fille, qui était tout ce qu’il restait autour d’elle de l’amour de Maxime, lui rappelait-elle des heures de jouissance mortes à jamais. Peut-être se trouvait-elle simplement touchée par la fidélité de cette servante, de ce brave cœur dont rien ne semblait ébranler la tranquille sollicitude. Elle la remerciait, au fond de ses remords, d’avoir assisté à ses hontes, sans la quitter de dégoût ; elle s’imaginait des abnégations, toute une vie de renoncement, pour arriver à comprendre le calme de la chambrière devant l’inceste, ses mains glacées, ses soins respectueux et tranquilles. Et elle se trouvait d’autant plus heureuse de son dévouement, qu’elle la savait honnête et économe, sans amant, sans vices.","In the collapse of her affections, there came a moment when Renée had only her maid to love. She had gradually developed a maternal affection for Celeste. Perhaps this girl, who was all that remained around her of Maxime's love, reminded her of hours of enjoyment that had died forever. Perhaps she was simply touched by the fidelity of this servant, of this brave heart whose tranquil solicitude nothing seemed to shake. She thanked her, in the depths of her remorse, for having witnessed her shame, without leaving her in disgust; she imagined self-sacrifice, a whole life of renunciation, in order to come to understand the chambermaid's calm in the face of incest, her icy hands, her respectful and tranquil care. And she was all the happier with her devotion, as she knew she was honest and thrifty, without a lover, without vices.","With the collapse of her affections, there came a time when she had no one left to love but her maid. Little by little she conceived a maternal affection for Céleste. It may have been that this girl, the only residue of her love for Maxime, reminded her of hours of pleasure now gone forever. Or maybe she was just touched by this servant’s loyalty, by the fidelity of this stouthearted woman whose tranquil solicitude seemed unshakable. In the depth of her remorse she thanked Céleste for having witnessed her shame without abandoning her in disgust. She imagined all sorts of self-denial, a whole life of renunciation, in her effort to comprehend the maid’s calm acceptance of incest, her icy hands, her respectful, unflappable attentiveness. And Céleste’s devotion pleased Renée all the more because she knew her to be honest and thrifty, a woman without a lover and untouched by vice.","As Renée’s affections crumbled there came a time when she had only her maid left to love. She had gradually developed a maternal fondness for Céleste. Perhaps this girl, who was all that remained to remind her of Maxime’s love, recalled the hours of pleasure forever dead.

From the depths of her remorse she thanked her for having witnessed her shame without leaving her in disgust; she pictured self-denials, a whole life of renunciation, before becoming able to understand the calmness of the maidservant in the presence of incest, her icy hands, her respectful and serene attentions; and she was all the happier in the girl’s devotion as she knew her to be virtuous and thrifty, with no lovers and no vices."
"Céleste prit la chemise des mains du jeune homme. Il se leva, alla regarder le grand lit gris et rose, s’arrêta à un des bouquets brochés de la tenture, pour tourner la tête, pour ne pas voir les seins nus de Renée. C’était instinctif. Il ne se croyait plus son amant, il n’avait plus le droit de voir. Puis il tira un cigare de sa poche et l’alluma. Renée lui avait permis de fumer chez elle. Enfin Céleste se retira, laissant la jeune femme au coin du feu, toute blanche dans son vêtement de nuit.","Celeste took the shirt from the young man's hands. He got up, went to look at the big gray and pink bed, stopped at one of the brocaded bouquets on the wall hanging, to turn his head, so as not to see Renée's bare breasts. It was instinctive. He no longer believed himself her lover, he no longer had the right to see. Then he took a cigar from his pocket and lit it. Renee had allowed him to smoke in her house. Finally Celeste withdrew, leaving the young woman by the fireside, all white in her nightwear.","Céleste took the nightgown from the young man’s hands. He got up, went over to look at the big gray-and-pink bed, and let his eyes linger over one of the bouquets embroidered in the hanging so as to avoid looking at Renée’s naked breasts.

Renée had always allowed him to smoke in her apartment. Céleste went out, leaving the young woman by the fire, all white in her bedtime attire.","Céleste took the nightdress from the young man’s hands. He stood up and went over to the great pink-and-grey bed, examining one of the embroidered bouquets on the curtains so as to avert his eyes from the sight of Renée’s bare breasts.

"Maxime attendait passivement une occasion qui le débarrassât de cette maîtresse gênante. Il disait de nouveau qu’ils avaient fait une bêtise. Si leur camaraderie avait d’abord mis dans leurs rapports d’amoureux une volupté de plus, elle lui empêchait aujourd’hui de rompre, comme il l’aurait certainement fait avec une autre femme. Il ne serait plus revenu ; c’était sa façon de dénouer ses amours, pour éviter tout effort et toute querelle. Mais il se sentait incapable d’un éclat, et il s’oubliait même volontiers encore dans les caresses de Renée ; elle était maternelle, elle payait pour lui, elle le tirerait d’embarras, si quelque créancier se fâchait. Puis l’idée de Louise, l’idée du million de dot revenait, lui faisait penser, jusque sous les baisers de la jeune femme, « que tout cela était bel et bon, mais que ce n’était pas sérieux, et qu’il faudrait bien que ça finît ».","Maxime was passively waiting for an opportunity to get rid of this troublesome mistress. He said again that they had done something stupid. If their camaraderie had first given their love relationship an added pleasure, today it prevented him from breaking up, as he would certainly have done with another woman. He wouldn't have come back; it was his way of untying his love, to avoid all effort and all quarrel. But he felt himself incapable of an outburst, and he even willingly forgot himself still in Renée's caresses; she was maternal, she paid for him, she would get him out of trouble if some creditor got angry. Then Louise's idea, the idea of the million dowries came back, made her think, even under the kisses of the young woman, ""that all that was fine and good, but that it wasn't serious, and that it should end.""","Maxime passively waited for an occasion that would allow him to get rid of this troublesome mistress. He said again that they had done something foolish. Although their camaraderie had initially added a novel pleasure to their amours, it now prevented him from breaking off the relationship, as he certainly would have done with another woman. He simply wouldn’t have returned: that was his way of ending his affairs, so as to avoid all effort and any possibility of a quarrel. But he felt incapable of any grand gesture and was indeed still glad to abandon himself to Renée’s caresses. She was motherly, she paid his way, she rescued him from difficulty when a creditor lost patience with him. The idea of Louise came back to him, the idea of the million-franc dowry, and this made him think, even as Renée showered him with kisses, “that all this is fine and dandy, but it isn’t serious, and it’s high time to end it.”","Maxime waited patiently for an opportunity to rid himself of this irksome mistress. He repeated once more that they had been foolish. Though their domestic closeness had at first lent an additional voluptuousness to their affair, it now prevented him from breaking it off, as he would have done with any other woman. He would have stayed away; that was his way of ending his affairs, so as to avoid all effort or argument. But he felt powerless, and he still even willingly forgot himself in Renée’s embraces : she was motherly, she paid for him, she was ready to get him out of trouble whenever a creditor lost patience. Then the thought of Louise came back, the thought of the dowry of a million francs, and it made him reflect, even amid Renée’s kisses, that ‘this was all very well, but it was not serious and must come to an end some time’."
"Saccard n’avait pas même voulu qu’il prêtât de l’argent à sa femme, s’amusant lui-même à cette grosse ficelle de mélodrame, où se plaisait son amour des trafics compliqués.","Saccard had not even wanted him to lend his wife money, amusing himself with this great string of melodrama, in which his love of complicated dealings delighted.","Saccard had not even wanted Larsonneau to lend money to his wife, preferring to amuse himself by staging an elaborate melodrama that appealed to his weakness for complicated chicanery.","Saccard had not even allowed him to lend money to his wife, taking pleasure himself in this piece of theatre, which satisfied his weakness for complicated transactions."
"La tante la retint encore, la main sur la rampe de l’escalier.","The aunt held her back again, her hand on the banister.","Her aunt continued to hold on to her with one hand, the other hand resting on the banister.","Aunt Élisabeth held her back, her hand on the balustrade."
— Et tu t’ennuies ! reprit le jeune homme avec une vivacité comique. Mais c’est un meurtre !… Que veux-tu ? Que rêves-tu donc ?,"""And you're bored!"" resumed the young man with comic vivacity. But it's murder!... What do you want? What are you dreaming of?",“And you’re bored!” the young man resumed with comic passion. “You slay me! . . . But what do you want? What do you dream of ?”,"‘And you’re bored!’ resumed the young man, with comic indignation. ‘It’s scandalous! What is it you want? What on earth are you dreaming about?’"
"— Mais je ne puis pas, dit-il avec angoisse, tu sais bien que je ne puis pas…","— But I can't, he said with anguish, you know very well that I can't...","“But I can’t,” he said in great distress, “you know very well that I can’t.”","‘But I can’t,’ he said in an anguished tone. ‘You know very well I can’t…’"
"Cependant le fiacre tournait la Madeleine et s’engageait sur les boulevards. Là, il s’emplit de clartés dansantes, du reflet des magasins dont les vitrines flambaient. Blanche Müller habitait, à deux pas, une des maisons neuves qu’on a bâties sur les terrains exhaussés de la rue Basse-du-Rempart. Il n’y avait encore que quelques voitures à la porte. Il n’était guère plus de dix heures. Maxime voulait faire un tour sur les boulevards, attendre une heure ; mais Renée, dont la curiosité s’éveillait, plus vive, lui déclara carrément qu’elle allait monter toute seule, s’il ne l’accompagnait pas. Il la suivit, et fut heureux de trouver en haut plus de monde qu’il ne l’aurait cru. La jeune femme avait mis son masque. Au bras de Maxime, auquel elle donnait à voix basse des ordres sans réplique, et qui lui obéissait docilement, elle fureta dans toutes les pièces, souleva le coin des portières, examina l’ameublement, serait allée jusqu’à fouiller les tiroirs, si elle n’avait pas eu peur d’être vue.","Meanwhile the cab turned the Madeleine and entered the boulevards. There, it is filled with dancing lights, the reflection of the shops whose windows were on fire. Blanche Müller lived, a stone's throw away, in one of the new houses that have been built on the raised grounds of rue Basse-du-Rempart. There were still only a few cars at the gate. It was barely past ten o'clock. Maxime wanted to take a walk on the boulevards, wait an hour; but Renée, whose curiosity was awakening more keenly, declared to him frankly that she was going to go up alone if he did not accompany her. He followed her, and was glad to find more people upstairs than he expected. The young woman had put on her mask. Armed with Maxime, to whom she gave unanswerable orders in a low voice, and who obediently obeyed her, she ferreted about in all the rooms, lifted the corners of the doors, examined the furniture, would have gone so far as to search the drawers, if she had not been afraid of being seen.","Meanwhile, the cab rounded the Madeleine and proceeded down one of the boulevards. Dancing light from blazing store windows now filled its interior. Blanche Muller lived nearby in one of the new houses built after the rue Basse-du-Rempart was filled in and brought up to grade. There were still only a few carriages at the door. It was just past ten. Maxime wanted to tour the boulevards for an hour before going in, but Renée, her curiosity aroused, told him flatly that she would go up herself if he didn’t go with her. He followed her and was pleased to find a bigger crowd than he had expected. The young woman had covered her face with a mask. She went about on Maxime’s arm, whispering peremptory orders that he docilely obeyed, and thereby managed to poke her nose into all the rooms, lift the edges of door-curtains, and examine the furniture, and she would have rummaged in the drawers as well had she not been afraid of being seen.","The cab turned round the Madeleine and joined the flow of traffic on the boulevards.

"Le coup de fortune de Charonne marchait bien, tout en lui laissant des inquiétudes sur le dénouement. Larsonneau, avec son linge éblouissant, avait des sourires qui lui déplaisaient. Il n’était qu’un pur intermédiaire, qu’un prête-nom dont il payait les complaisances par un intérêt de dix pour cent sur les bénéfices futurs. Mais, bien que l’agent d’expropriation n’eût pas mis un sou dans l’affaire, et que Saccard, après avoir fourni les fonds du café-concert, eût pris toutes ses précautions, contrevente, lettres dont la date restait en blanc, quittances données à l’avance, ce dernier n’en éprouvait pas moins une peur sourde, un pressentiment de quelque traîtrise. Il flairait, chez son complice, l’intention de le faire chanter, à l’aide de cet inventaire faux que celui-ci gardait précieusement, et auquel il devait uniquement d’être de l’affaire.","Charonne's stroke of fortune worked well, while leaving him worried about the outcome. Larsonneau, with his dazzling linen, smiled with displeasure. He was only a pure intermediary, a nominee whose complacency he paid with an interest of ten per cent on future profits. But, although the expropriation agent had not put a penny into the affair, and although Saccard, after providing the funds for the café-concert, had taken all his precautions, counter-sale, letters whose date remained in white, receipts given in advance, the latter nevertheless felt a dull fear, a presentiment of some treachery. He smelled out, in his accomplice, the intention of blackmailing him, with the help of this false inventory which the latter treasured, and to which he owed only to be involved.","The Charonne deal was proving to be a stroke of fortune, though how it would turn out in the end still worried him. Larsonneau, for all his dazzling linen, smiled in a way he found unpleasant. The expropriation agent was only a go-between, a front whose complicity he bought with a commission of ten percent of all future profits. Yet even though his associate had not invested a penny in the deal, and Saccard, after providing him with the funds to build the music hall, had taken every possible precaution—options, undated letters, antedated receipts—he nevertheless felt an obscure foreboding, a presentiment of treachery. He suspected his accomplice of intending to blackmail him with the fake inventory that remained in his possession, which was the only reason Saccard had cut him in on the deal.","The Charonne venture was progressing well, though he was still anxious about its outcome. Larsonneau, with his dazzling shirtfront, had a way of smiling which he did not like. He was just a go-between, a man of straw, whose assistance he paid for by giving him a commission of ten per cent on his profits. But although the expropriation agent had not put a sou into the enterprise, and Saccard had not only found the money for the music-hall but had taken every precaution—a deed of retrocession, undated letters, predated receipts—the latter remained apprehensive, and felt a presentiment of treachery. He suspected his accomplice of planning to blackmail him by using the false inventory he had carefully preserved, and which alone he had to thank for his share in the business."
"Ce membre se récria sur le chiffre de cinq cent mille francs que, selon lui, on devait réduire de plus de moitié. Aristide avait eu l’impudence de faire demander sept cent mille francs.

"Et les voix continuèrent, brutales, sonnant étrangement sous les palmes tombantes des massifs. Mais elles traversèrent comme un vain bruit le rêve de Renée, devant laquelle se dressait, avec l’appel du vertige, une jouissance inconnue, chaude de crime, plus âpre que toutes celles qu’elle avait déjà épuisées, la dernière qu’elle eût encore à boire.

— Le pis est que j’ai une faim atroce.,“The worst part is that I am horribly hungry.,"She fell silent, stared once more at the boulevard, and then, after an interval, added with a distraught look, “The worst of it is that I’m terribly hungry.”",‘The worst of it is that I’m awfully hungry.’

"Maxime, lui, trouvait le monde assommant. C’était par « chic » qu’il prétendait s’y ennuyer, car il ne s’amusait réellement nulle part. Aux Tuileries, chez les ministres, il disparaissait dans les jupons de Renée. Mais il redevenait le maître, dès qu’il s’agissait de quelque escapade. Renée voulut revoir le cabinet du boulevard, et la largeur du divan la fit sourire. Puis, il la mena un peu partout, chez les filles, au bal de l’Opéra[37] , dans les avant-scènes des petits théâtres, dans tous les endroits équivoques où ils pouvaient coudoyer le vice brutal, en goûtant les joies de l’incognito. Quand ils rentraient furtivement à l’hôtel, brisés de fatigue, ils s’endormaient aux bras l’un de l’autre, cuvant l’ivresse du Paris ordurier, avec des lambeaux de couplets grivois chantant encore à leurs oreilles. Le lendemain, Maxime imitait les acteurs, et Renée, sur le piano du petit salon, cherchait à retrouver la voix rauque et les déhanchements de Blanche Müller dans son rôle de la Belle Hélène[38] . Ses leçons de musique du couvent ne lui servaient plus qu’à écorcher les couplets des bouffonneries nouvelles. Elle avait une horreur sainte pour les airs sérieux. Maxime « blaguait » avec elle la musique allemande, et il crut devoir aller siffler le Tannhäuser[39] par conviction, et pour défendre les refrains égrillards de sa belle-mère.","Maxime found the world boring. It was by ""chic"" that he pretended to be bored there, because he was not really having fun anywhere. At the Tuileries, among the ministers, he disappeared into Renee's petticoats. But he became master again whenever it was a question of some escapade. Renée wanted to see the office on the boulevard again, and the width of the divan made her smile. Then he took her everywhere, to the girls, to the ball at the Opera[37] , to the prosceniums of small theatres, to all the equivocal places where they could rub shoulders with brutal vice, tasting the joys of the incognito. When they sneaked back to the hotel, worn out with fatigue, they fell asleep in each other's arms, sleeping off the drunkenness of filthy Paris, with shreds of bawdy verses still ringing in their ears. The next day, Maxime imitated the actors, and Renée, on the piano in the small living room, tried to rediscover the hoarse voice and the swaying hips of Blanche Müller in her role of La Belle Hélène. His convent music lessons served him only to scratch the verses of the new antics. She had a holy horror of serious airs. Maxime ""joked"" German music with her, and he thought he should go and whistle the Tannhäuser[39] out of conviction, and to defend his mother-in-law's bawdy refrains.","Maxime found society tedious. In fact he thought it chic to be bored, because he did not really enjoy himself anywhere. At the Tuileries and the ministries he hid behind Renée’s petticoats. He took charge again, however, whenever an escapade was in the offing. Renée asked to return to the private room on the boulevard, where the width of the divan made her smile. After that he took her all over, to visit prostitutes, to the Bal de l’Opéra,3 to the front rows of burlesque houses, wherever raw vice could be savored incognito. Dead tired, they would then sneak back into the house and fall asleep in each other’s arms, sleeping off the intoxication of gutter Paris with snatches of ribald tunes still ringing in their ears. The next day, Maxime would mimic the actors, and Renée, playing the piano in the small salon, would attempt to emulate Blanche Muller’s hoarse voice and bumps and grinds in the role of La Belle Hélène. 4 Her music lessons at the convent were of no use to her now except to murder the latest burlesque numbers. Serious music filled her with horror. Maxime jeered at German music right along with her, and he felt it his duty to go hiss at Tannhäuser5 partly out of conviction and partly to defend his stepmother’s bawdy refrains.","Maxime considered high society utterly tedious. It was to seem ‘smart’ that he pretended to be so bored, for he did not really enjoy himself anywhere. At the Tuileries, at the ministers’ houses, he disappeared behind Renée’s skirts. But he resumed the reins as soon as there was a possibility of some escapade. Renée wanted to see the private room on the boulevard again, and the width of the sofa made her smile. Then he took her to all sorts of places, to the houses of courtesans, to the Opera ball, to the stage-boxes of burlesque theatres, to every dubious place where they could rub shoulders with pure vice and delight in their anonymity. When they stealthily returned home, worn out, they fell asleep in each other’s arms, sleeping off the intoxication of obscene Paris, with snatches of ribald couplets still ringing in their ears. The next day Maxime imitated the actors, and Renée, seated at the piano in the little drawing room, tried to reproduce the raucous voice and jaunty attitudes of Blanche Muller as La Belle Hélène. * Her convent music lessons now only helped her to murder the verses of the new burlesque songs. She detested serious compositions. Maxime made fun of German music with her, and felt it his duty to go and hiss at Tannhäuser both by conviction and in defence of his stepmother’s sprightly refrains. *"
"Ils arrivèrent enfin au terme de leur course. Les anciens terrains de Mme Aubertot étaient très vastes ; le café-concert et le jardin n’en occupaient guère que la moitié, le reste se trouvait semé de quelques maisons sans importance. Le nouveau boulevard prenait ce grand parallélogramme en écharpe, ce qui avait calmé une des craintes de Saccard ; il s’était imaginé pendant longtemps que le café-concert seul serait écorné. Aussi Larsonneau avait-il reçu l’ordre de parler très haut, les bordures de plus-value devant au moins quintupler de valeur. Il menaçait déjà la Ville de se servir d’un récent décret autorisant les propriétaires à ne livrer que le sol nécessaire aux travaux d’utilité publique.","They finally arrived at the end of their race. Madame Aubertot's former lands were very large; the café-concert and the garden hardly occupied more than half of it, the rest was strewn with a few unimportant houses. The new boulevard took this great parallelogram as a sling, which had calmed one of Saccard's fears; he had imagined for a long time that the café-concert alone would be tarnished. So Larsonneau had been ordered to speak very loudly, the borders of surplus value having to at least quintuple in value. He was already threatening the City to use a recent decree authorizing owners to deliver only the soil necessary for public utility works.","At last they came to the end of their route. The property that had previously belonged to Mme Aubertot was quite extensive. The music hall and garden occupied barely half of it. A few nondescript houses were scattered around the remaining land. The fact that the new boulevard cut diagonally across this large parallelogram had allayed one of Saccard’s fears. For a long time he had worried that only the music hall would be affected by the planned route. He had accordingly instructed Larsonneau to talk things up, since the value of the adjacent land should have increased at least fivefold. He was already threatening the city by saying that he might invoke a recent ordinance authorizing landowners to surrender only that portion of a property absolutely essential for public works.","They arrived at last at the end of their journey. The land that was formerly Madame Aubertot’s was very extensive; the music-hall and the garden took up barely half of it, the rest had here and there a few nondescript houses. The new boulevard cut diagonally across this huge parallelogram, and this had allayed one of Saccard’s fears: he had long imagined that only a corner of the music-hall would be cut off. Accordingly Larsonneau had been instructed to talk very big, as the bordering plots ought to increase at least fivefold in value. He was already threatening the City with a recent decree that authorized the landowners to provide no more than the land absolutely necessary for the public works."
"Pendant ce temps, M. Hupel de la Noue restait embarrassé, s’appuyant au fauteuil du baron Gouraud, qui s’était contenté d’échanger avec le ministre une poignée de main silencieuse. Le poète n’osait quitter la place. Un sentiment indéfinissable, la crainte de paraître ridicule, la peur de perdre les bonnes grâces de son chef, le retenaient, malgré l’envie furieuse qu’il avait d’aller placer ces dames sur l’estrade, pour le dernier tableau. Il attendait qu’un mot heureux lui vînt et le fît rentrer en faveur. Mais il ne trouvait rien. Il se sentait de plus en plus gêné, lorsqu’il aperçut M. de Saffré ; il lui prit le bras, s’accrocha à lui comme à une planche de salut. Le jeune homme entrait, c’était une victime toute fraîche.","During this time, M. Hupel de la Noue remained embarrassed, leaning on the chair of Baron Gouraud, who had contented himself with exchanging a silent handshake with the Minister. The poet dared not leave the square. An indefinable feeling, the fear of appearing ridiculous, the fear of losing the good graces of his chief, held him back, in spite of the furious desire he had to go and place the ladies on the platform for the last tableau. He was waiting for a happy word to come to him and bring him back into favor. But he couldn't find anything. He felt more and more embarrassed when he saw M. de Saffré; he took his arm, clung to him as to a lifeline. The young man entered, he was a fresh victim.","Meanwhile, M. Hupel de la Noue continued to lean uncomfortably on Baron Gouraud’s chair after the baron contented himself with a silent shake of the minister’s hand. The poet did not dare move from the spot, held there by an indefinable sentiment, a fear of looking ridiculous and of forfeiting the approval of his superior, despite his burning desire to go backstage to position the women for the final tableau. He was waiting for some clever remark to occur to him and restore him to favor. But none came. He was feeling more and more embarrassed when he spotted M. de Saffré, took him by the arm, and latched on to him as to a life raft. The young man had just arrived; here was a fresh victim.","Meanwhile Monsieur Hupel de la Noue remained ill at ease, leaning against the armchair of Baron Gouraud, who had contented himself with silently shaking hands with the minister.

"Quand un remords plus cuisant faisait frissonner Renée, elle avait des rébellions superbes. Quel était donc son crime, et pourquoi aurait-elle rougi ? Est-ce qu’elle ne marchait pas chaque jour sur des infamies plus grandes ? Est-ce qu’elle ne coudoyait pas, chez les ministres, aux Tuileries, partout, des misérables comme elle, qui avaient sur leur chair des millions et qu’on adorait à deux genoux ! Et elle songeait à l’amitié honteuse d’Adeline d’Espanet et de Suzanne Haffner, dont on souriait parfois aux lundis de l’impératrice. Elle se rappelait le négoce de Mme de Lauwerens, que les maris célébraient pour sa bonne conduite, son ordre, son exactitude à payer ses fournisseurs. Elle nommait Mme Daste, Mme Teissière, la baronne de Meinhold, ces créatures dont les amants payaient le luxe, et qui étaient cotées dans le beau monde comme des valeurs à la Bourse. Mme de Guende était tellement bête et tellement bien faite, qu’elle avait pour amants trois officiers supérieurs à la fois, sans pouvoir les distinguer, à cause de leur uniforme ; ce qui faisait dire à ce démon de Louise qu’elle les forçait d’abord à se mettre en chemise, pour savoir auquel des trois elle parlait. La comtesse Vanska, elle, se souvenait des cours où elle avait chanté, des trottoirs le long desquels on prétendait l’avoir revue, vêtue d’indienne, rôdant comme une louve. Chacune de ces femmes avait sa honte, sa plaie étalée et triomphante. Puis, les dominant toutes, la duchesse de Sternich se dressait, laide, vieillie, lassée, avec la gloire d’avoir passé une nuit dans le lit impérial ; c’était le vice officiel, elle en gardait comme une majesté de la débauche et une souveraineté sur cette bande d’illustres coureuses.","When a more burning remorse made Renée shudder, she had superb rebellions. What was her crime, and why would she blush? Didn't she walk every day on greater infamies? Didn't she rub shoulders, at the ministers', at the Tuileries, everywhere, with wretches like her, who had millions on their flesh and who were adored on both knees! And she thought of the shameful friendship of Adeline d'Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, who were sometimes smiled at on Empress Mondays. She remembered Madame de Lauwerens' business, whom husbands celebrated for her good conduct, her orderliness, her punctuality in paying her suppliers. She named Madame Daste, Madame Teissière, the Baronne de Meinhold, those creatures whose lovers paid for the luxury, and who were quoted in the high society like stocks on the Stock Exchange. Madame de Guende was so stupid and so well made that she had three superior officers at a time as lovers, without being able to distinguish them because of their uniforms; which made that demon Louise say that she first forced them to put on their blouses, to find out which of the three she was talking about. The Countess Vanska remembered the lessons where she had sung, the sidewalks along which they claimed to have seen her again, dressed in calico, prowling like a wolf. Each of these women had her shame, her wound spread and triumphant. Then, dominating them all, the Duchesse de Sternich rose, ugly, aged, weary, with the glory of having passed a night in the imperial bed; it was the official vice, she kept from it a majesty of debauchery and a sovereignty over this band of illustrious runners.","When more searing pangs of remorse left her quivering, her pride sometimes rebelled. What crime had she committed, after all, and what reason did she have to blush? Did she not stumble upon greater infamies every day? Did she not rub elbows at the ministries and in the Tuileries—everywhere, in fact—with wretches like herself who draped their flesh with millions and whom men worshiped on their knees? And she thought of the shameful friendship of Adeline d’Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, about which people sometimes smiled at the Empress’s Mondays. She remembered the mercenary business of Mme de Lauwerens, whom husbands celebrated for her good conduct, her orderliness, and her punctiliousness in paying her suppliers. She pronounced the names of Mme Daste, Mme Teissière, and Baroness von Meinhold, ladies whose luxurious lifestyles were paid for by their lovers and whose prices were quoted in high society the way shares of stock are quoted on the Bourse. Mme de Guende had such an empty head and such a beautiful figure that she had three high-ranking officers as lovers at the same time and could not tell them apart because all of them wore the same uniform: that little devil Louise said she forced them all to strip down to their shirts so that she could tell which one she was talking to. Countess Wanska remembered the courtyards she had sung in and the sidewalks where people said they had seen her prowling like a wolf in calico. Those women wore their shame in triumph, displayed their wounds as trophies. And lording it over them all was the wasted, old, and ugly Duchess von Sternich, who gloried in having spent a night in the imperial bed. She was vice made official, and from this past she retained something of a majesty in debauchery, a sovereign power over this illustrious band of harlots.","When a keener feeling of remorse than usual made Renée shudder, she would react powerfully. What was her crime after all, and why should she blush? Did she not tread on greater infamies every day? Did she not rub shoulders at ministers’ houses, at the Tuileries, everywhere, with wretches like herself, who wore millions on their bodies and were adored on both knees? She thought of the shameful intimacy of Adeline d’Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, which drew occasional smiles at the Empress’s Mondays. She recalled the shady dealings of Madame de Lauwerens, whose praises were sung by husbands for her propriety, her orderly conduct, her promptness in paying her bills. She recalled the names of Madame Daste, Madame Teissière, the Baronne de Meinhold, those creatures who let their lovers pay for their luxuries, and who were quoted in fashionable society as shares are quoted on the Bourse. Madame de Guende was so stupid and yet so beautiful, that she had three high-ranking officers as lovers at the same time, and was unable to tell one from the other, because of their uniform; which was why that devil Louise said that she first made them strip off so that she could tell which of the three she was talking to. The Comtesse Vanska, for her part, could remember courtyards in which she had sung, pavements on which she had been seen, dressed in calico, prowling along like a she-wolf. Each of these women had her shame, her open, triumphant sore. Finally, dominating them all, the Duchesse de Sternich, old, ugly, worn out, with the halo of a night spent in the Imperial bed; she typified official vice, from which she derived, as it were, a majesty of debauch and a sovereignty over this band of illustrious prostitutes."
"Tout le baron Gouraud tenait dans cette courte biographie : fait baron par Napoléon Ier, en récompense de biscuits avariés fournis à la Grande Armée, il avait tour à tour été pair sous Louis XVIII, sous Charles X, sous Louis-Philippe, et il était sénateur sous Napoléon III. C’était un adorateur du trône, des quatre planches dorées recouvertes de velours ; peu lui importait l’homme qui s’y trouvait assis. Avec son ventre énorme, sa face de bœuf, son allure d’éléphant, il était d’une coquinerie charmante ; il se vendait avec majesté et commettait les plus grosses infamies au nom du devoir et de la conscience. Mais cet homme étonnait encore plus par ses vices. Il courait sur lui des histoires qu’on ne pouvait raconter qu’à l’oreille. Ses soixante-dix-huit ans fleurissaient en pleine débauche monstrueuse. À deux reprises, on avait dû étouffer de sales aventures, pour qu’il n’allât pas traîner son habit brodé de sénateur sur les bancs de la cour d’assises.","Everything about Baron Gouraud was contained in this short biography: made a baron by Napoleon I, as a reward for damaged biscuits supplied to the Grande Armée, he had in turn been a peer under Louis XVIII, under Charles X, under Louis-Philippe, and he was senator under Napoleon III. He was a worshiper of the throne, of the four gilt boards covered with velvet; he didn't care who was sitting there. With his enormous belly, his beefy face, his elephantine bearing, he was charmingly rascally; he sold himself with majesty and committed the greatest infamies in the name of duty and conscience. But this man astonished still more by his vices. There were stories about him that could only be told by ear. His seventy-eight years were blooming in full monstrous debauchery. Twice it had been necessary to hush up dirty adventures so that he wouldn't drag his embroidered senator's coat over the benches of the assize court.","All of Baron Gouraud is summed up in this brief biography: made a baron by Napoleon I for supplying the Grand Army with spoiled rations, he was a peer under Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis-Philippe21 in succession and became a senator under Napoleon III.

With his enormous belly, bovine face, and elephantine gait, he proved to be a charming rogue. He sold himself in the most majestic manner and committed the most dishonorable acts in the name of duty and conscience. His vices were even more astonishing. There were rumors about him that could only be whispered. Despite his seventy-eight years, monstrous debauchery was his element. On two occasions his filthy escapades had had to be hushed up in order to keep his sumptuous senatorial robes from being dragged through the criminal courts.","Baron Gouraud’s life story could be summarized as follows: he was made a baron by Napoleon I as a reward for supplying damaged biscuits to the Grande Armée, he was a peer successively under Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis-Philippe, and he was a senator under Napoleon III.

"Les couples s’assirent autour du salon, sur tous les sièges qu’on put réunir ; des jeunes gens allèrent chercher jusqu’aux chaises de fonte de la serre. C’était un cotillon monstre.

"Il s’était substitué à l’État et lui servait la rente des cent mille francs provenant de la rue de la Pépinière ; d’autre part, il lui avait fait vendre la propriété de la Sologne, pour en mettre l’argent dans une grande affaire, un placement superbe, disait-il. Elle n’avait donc plus entre les mains que les terrains de Charonne, qu’elle refusait obstinément d’aliéner, pour ne pas attrister l’excellente tante Élisabeth. Et là encore, il préparait un coup de génie, avec l’aide de son ancien complice Larsonneau. D’ailleurs, elle restait son obligée ; s’il lui avait pris sa fortune, il lui en payait cinq ou six fois les revenus. La rente des cent mille francs, jointe au produit de l’argent de la Sologne, montait à peine à neuf ou dix mille francs, juste de quoi solder sa lingère et son cordonnier. Il lui donnait ou donnait pour elle quinze et vingt fois cette misère. Il aurait travaillé huit jours pour lui voler cent francs, et il l’entretenait royalement. Aussi, comme tout le monde, elle avait le respect de la caisse monumentale de son mari, sans chercher à pénétrer le néant de ce fleuve d’or qui lui passait sous les yeux, et dans lequel elle se jetait chaque matin.","He had substituted himself for the State and paid it the rent of the hundred thousand francs coming from the Rue de la Pépinière; on the other hand, he had made him sell the Sologne property, to put the money into a big business, a superb investment, he said. She had no longer in her hands, therefore, except the land of Charonne, which she obstinately refused to alienate, so as not to sadden the excellent Aunt Élisabeth. And there again, he was preparing a stroke of genius, with the help of his former accomplice Larsonneau. Besides, she remained his debtor; if he had taken his fortune, he paid him five or six times the income. The rent of the hundred thousand francs, added to the proceeds of the Sologne money, hardly amounted to nine or ten thousand francs, just enough to pay his seamstress and shoemaker. He gave her or gave for her fifteen or twenty times that misery. He would have worked a week to steal a hundred francs from her, and he supported her royally. Also, like everyone else, she had respect for her husband's monumental fund, without trying to penetrate the nothingness of this golden river which passed before her eyes, and into which she threw herself every morning.","Saccard, substituting himself for the state, paid her the interest on the hundred thousand francs from the rue de la Pépinière. In addition, he persuaded her to sell the Sologne property in order to invest the money in an important deal—a superb investment, he told her. All she had left, therefore, was the land in Charonne, which she stubbornly refused to sell in order to spare her excellent Aunt Elisabeth the sorrow. There again he plotted a masterstroke with the help of his former accomplice Larsonneau. In any case, she remained in his debt; if he took her fortune, he paid her back five or six times the income it would have earned. The interest on a hundred thousand francs, together with the yield on the money from Sologne, came to barely nine or ten thousand francs, just enough to keep her in underwear and shoes. He gave her, or paid out on her behalf, fifteen to twenty times that paltry sum. He would have put in a week’s work to rob her of a hundred francs, and he kept her royally. So she, along with everyone else, respected her husband’s monumental treasure without investigating the emptiness of the river of gold that flowed before her eyes and into which she dove every morning.","He had taken the place of the State, and paid her the interest on the hundred thousand francs coming from the Rue de la Pépinière; on the other hand, he had made her sell the Sologne property in order to sink the proceeds in a great business project.

But Saccard was preparing a stroke of genius, with the help of his old accomplice, Larsonneau. Renée remained his debtor; though he had taken her fortune, he paid her the income five or six times over. The interest on the hundred thousand francs, added to the revenue from the Sologne money, amounted to barely nine or ten thousand francs, just enough to pay her hosier and bootmaker. He gave her, or spent on her, fifteen or twenty times that sum. He would have worked for a week to rob her of a hundred francs, and he kept her like a queen.

"Ce mystère était un piment qu’elle ajoutait à son escapade ; simple raffinement de jouissance, car elle serait sortie à minuit par la grande porte, que son mari n’aurait pas seulement mis la tête à la fenêtre.","This mystery was a spice she added to her escapade; simple refinement of enjoyment, because she would have left at midnight by the front door, that her husband would not have even put his head out of the window.","This mysterious proposal was just a way of adding spice to the escapade, a simple refinement of her pleasure, since she could have walked out the front door at midnight and her husband wouldn’t even have poked his head out the window.","This mysteriousness gave added spice to her escapade: a simple refinement of pleasure, for she could have left at midnight by the front door without her husband’s so much as putting his head out of the window."

"Le boulevard n’était pas encore éclairé. Pendant que le fiacre descendait vers la Madeleine, il faisait si nuit dans la voiture qu’ils ne se voyaient pas. Par instants, lorsque le jeune homme portait son cigare aux lèvres, un point rouge trouait les ténèbres épaisses. Ce point rouge intéressait Renée. Maxime, que le flot du domino de satin noir avait couvert à demi, en emplissant l’intérieur du fiacre, continuait à fumer en silence, d’un air d’ennui.

That red spot drew Renée’s attention. Maxime, half covered by the flowing black satin domino1 that filled the cab’s interior, continued to smoke in bored silence. The truth was that his stepmother’s whim was preventing him from joining a group of women who planned to meet at the Café Anglais before Blanche Muller’s ball and return there afterward. He was grumpy, and Renée sensed his sulk through the gloom.","The gas lamps had not yet been lit along the boulevard.

"Dans cette fortune, qui avait les clameurs et le débordement d’un torrent d’hiver, la dot de Renée se trouvait secouée, emportée, noyée. La jeune femme, méfiante les premiers jours, voulant gérer ses biens elle-même, se lassa bientôt des affaires ; puis elle se sentit pauvre à côté de son mari, et, la dette l’écrasant, elle dut avoir recours à lui, lui emprunter de l’argent, se mettre à sa discrétion. À chaque nouveau mémoire, qu’il payait avec un sourire d’homme tendre aux faiblesses humaines, elle se livrait un peu plus, lui confiait des titres de rente, l’autorisait à vendre ceci ou cela. Quand ils vinrent habiter l’hôtel du parc Monceau, elle se trouvait déjà presque entièrement dépouillée.","In this fortune, which had the clamor and overflow of a winter torrent, Renée's dowry found itself shaken, swept away, drowned. The young woman, suspicious the first days, wanting to manage her property herself, soon got tired of business; then she felt poor beside her husband, and, the debt crushing her, she had to have recourse to him, borrow money from him, place herself at his discretion. With each new memoir, which he paid for with the smile of a man tender to human weaknesses, she gave herself up a little more, entrusted him with securities, authorized him to sell this or that. When they came to live in the hotel in the Parc Monceau, she was already almost completely stripped.","This was a fortune that roared and overflowed like a winter torrent, which buffeted Renée’s dowry, swept it away, and inundated it. Wary at first, the young woman had wanted to manage her own property, but she quickly wearied of business matters.

With each new bill, which he paid with the smile of a man tolerant of human weakness, she surrendered a bit more of herself, entrusting him with bonds or authorizing him to sell this or that property. By the time they moved to the Parc Monceau mansion, she was already nearly picked clean.","In this fortune, which roared and overflowed like a winter torrent, Renée’s dowry was tossed about, carried off, and drowned.

With each fresh bill that he paid, with the smile of a man indulgent towards human foibles, she surrendered a little more, confiding dividend-warrants to him, authorizing him to sell this or that.

"Jamais il n’avait voulu, en effet, que Larsonneau vînt chez eux sur un pied d’intimité.

"Aristide suivait les conseils d’Eugène : il écoutait et il regardait. Quand il alla remercier son frère de son avancement, celui-ci comprit la révolution qui s’était opérée en lui ; il le complimenta sur ce qu’il appela sa bonne tenue. L’employé, que l’envie roidissait à l’intérieur, s’était fait souple et insinuant. En quelques mois, il devint un comédien prodigieux. Toute sa verve méridionale s’était éveillée, et il poussait l’art si loin, que ses camarades de l’Hôtel de Ville le regardaient comme un bon garçon que sa proche parenté avec un député désignait à l’avance pour quelque gros emploi. Cette parenté lui attirait également la bienveillance de ses chefs. Il vivait ainsi dans une sorte d’autorité supérieure à son emploi, qui lui permettait d’ouvrir certaines portes et de mettre le nez dans certains cartons, sans que ses indiscrétions parussent coupables. On le vit, pendant deux ans, rôder dans tous les couloirs, s’oublier dans toutes les salles, se lever vingt fois par jour pour aller causer avec un camarade, porter un ordre, faire un voyage à travers les bureaux, éternelles promenades qui faisaient dire à ses collègues : « Ce diable de Provençal ! il ne peut se tenir en place : il a du vif-argent dans les jambes. » Ses intimes le prenaient pour un paresseux, et le digne homme riait, quand ils l’accusaient de ne chercher qu’à voler quelques minutes à l’administration. Jamais il ne commit la faute d’écouter aux serrures ; mais il avait une façon carrée d’ouvrir les portes, de traverser les pièces, un papier à la main, l’air absorbé, d’un pas si lent et si régulier, qu’il ne perdait pas un mot des conversations. Ce fut une tactique de génie ; on finit par ne plus s’interrompre, au passage de cet employé actif, qui glissait dans l’ombre des bureaux et qui paraissait si préoccupé de sa besogne. Il eut encore une autre méthode ; il était d’une obligeance extrême, il offrait à ses camarades de les aider, dès qu’ils se mettaient en retard dans leur travail, et il étudiait alors les registres, les documents qui lui passaient sous les yeux, avec une tendresse recueillie. Mais un de ses péchés mignons fut de lier amitié avec les garçons de bureau. Il allait jusqu’à leur donner des poignées de main. Pendant des heures, il les faisait causer, entre deux portes, avec de petits rires étouffés, leur contant des histoires, provoquant leurs confidences. Ces braves gens l’adoraient, disaient de lui : « En voilà un qui n’est pas fier ! » Dès qu’il y avait un scandale, il en était informé le premier. C’est ainsi qu’au bout de deux ans, l’Hôtel de Ville n’eut plus de mystères pour lui. Il en connaissait le personnel jusqu’au dernier des lampistes, et les paperasses jusqu’aux notes des blanchisseuses.","Aristide followed Eugene's advice: he listened and he watched. When he went to thank his brother for his advancement, the latter understood the revolution which had taken place in him; he complimented him on what he called his good manners. The clerk, stiffened within by envy, had become supple and insinuating. In a few months, he became a prodigious actor. All his southern verve had awakened, and he carried his art so far that his comrades at the Hôtel de Ville regarded him as a good fellow whom his close relationship with a deputy had designated in advance for some important employment. This kinship also won him the goodwill of his chiefs. He thus lived in a sort of authority superior to his job, which allowed him to open certain doors and poke his nose into certain boxes, without his indiscretions appearing culpable. We saw him, for two years, prowling in all the corridors, forgetting himself in all the rooms, getting up twenty times a day to go and talk with a comrade, carry an order, take a trip through the offices, eternal walks that made his colleagues say: “That devil of a Provençal! he can't stand still: he has quicksilver in his legs. His intimates took him for a lazy man, and the worthy man laughed when they accused him of only trying to steal a few minutes from the administration. He never made the mistake of eavesdropping; but he had a square way of opening the doors, of crossing the rooms, a paper in his hand, with an absorbed air, with such a slow and regular step that he did not lose a word of conversation. It was a genius tactic; we ended up not interrupting each other as this active clerk passed, who glided through the shadows of the offices and who seemed so preoccupied with his work. He had yet another method; he was extremely obliging, he offered to help his comrades as soon as they were late in their work, and he then studied the registers, the documents which passed before his eyes, with a collected tenderness. But one of his cute sins was to befriend office boys. He went so far as to give them a handshake. For hours, he made them talk, between two doors, with little stifled laughter, telling them stories, provoking their confidences. These good people adored him, said of him: “Here is one who is not proud! As soon as there was a scandal, he was informed of it first. Thus, after two years, the Hôtel de Ville held no more mysteries for him. He knew the staff down to the last lamp-operator, and the paperwork down to the notes of the laundresses.","Aristide followed Eugène’s advice: he kept his eyes and ears open. When he went to thank his brother for the promotion, Eugène immediately grasped the change that had come over him and complimented him on what he called his “correct attire.” Though envy had stiffened his backbone, outwardly the clerk had become more pliable and ingratiating. Within the space of a few months he had become a prodigious actor. All his southern verve was now aroused, and he had developed his art to such a high pitch that his comrades at city hall looked upon him as a fine fellow destined for an important position on account of his close relationship to a deputy. That same relationship also put him in the good graces of his superiors. Hence he enjoyed greater authority than his position indicated, and this allowed him to open certain doors and poke his nose into certain boxes of files without his indiscretions seeming culpable. For two years he prowled all the corridors, lingered in all the chambers, and rose twenty times a day to chat with a coworker or deliver an order or make the rounds of the offices. Because he was perpetually in motion, his colleagues said, “That devil of a Provençal! He can’t sit still. He has quicksilver in his legs.” Those closest to him mistook him for lazy, and the worthy fellow laughed when they accused him of wanting nothing more than to steal a few minutes from his administrative chores. Never once did he commit the blunder of listening at keyholes, but he had a forthright way of opening doors and walking across rooms with a piece of paper in his hand and an abstracted look, yet at a pace so slow and deliberate that he never missed a word of what was being said. The tactic proved ingenious, because eventually people stopped interrupting themselves when this very busy clerk, apparently so preoccupied with his work, glided through the shadowy recesses of their offices. He had another method as well : he was extremely helpful, always offering to assist his fellow workers whenever they fell behind in their work and then studying with rapt attention whatever ledgers and documents were set before him. But one of his foibles was his penchant for befriending office boys. He went so far as to shake their hands and spent hour after hour with them in private conversation, stifling laughs, telling them stories, and encouraging them to open up to him. These fine lads adored him: “ That fellow there isn’t stuck-up like the rest of them,” they said when he passed by. Whenever a scandal erupted, he was the first to learn about it. So after two years, the Hôtel de Ville no longer held any mysteries for him. He knew the personnel down to the lowliest factotum and the paperwork down to the laundry bills.","Aristide followed Eugène’s advice: he kept his ears and eyes open. When he went to thank his brother for his promotion, the latter noticed how he had changed; he complimented him on what he called his good manners. The clerk, hardened by jealousy, had acquired a supple, insinuating style. Within a few months he had transformed himself into an accomplished actor. All his southern ardour had been aroused; and he had become so adept at deception that his fellow clerks at the Hôtel de Ville regarded him as a good sort whose family connection with a deputy marked him out for some plum appointment. This connection also earned him the goodwill of his superiors. He thus enjoyed a sort of authority above his station, which enabled him to open certain doors and examine certain files without any suspicion being attached to his indiscretion. For two years he was seen wandering round the corridors, lingering in all the rooms, leaving his desk twenty times a day to go and talk to a friend, or deliver a message, or take a stroll through the offices—endless little trips that made his colleagues exclaim: ‘That wretched Provençal! He can’t sit still: he’s got ants in his pants.’ His friends took him for an idler, and he laughed when they accused him of having but one thought, to cheat their bosses of a few minutes. He never made the mistake of listening at keyholes; but he had a way of boldly opening a door and walking through a room, with a document in his hand and a preoccupied air, and with a step so slow and measured that he did not miss a word of the conversation. It was a masterpiece of tactics; people stopped bothering to fall silent when this conscientious clerk passed by, gliding through the shadows of the offices and seeming so wrapped up in his work. He had one other method: he was extraordinarily obliging, he offered to help his fellow clerks whenever they fell behind with their work, and he would then study with great care and attention the account books and documents that passed through his hands. But one of his favourite tricks was to strike up friendships with the messengers. He went so far as to shake hands with them. For hours at a stretch he would keep them talking with stifled little bursts of laughter, telling them stories, inducing them to take him into their confidence. They worshipped him, and said of him: ‘There’s a man who doesn’t take himself too seriously.’ He was the first to be told of any scandal. So it came about that after two years the Hôtel de Ville was an open book to him. He knew every member of the staff down to the most junior lamplighter, and every official document down to the laundress’s bills."
"Elle écarta la chemisette, disparut pendant deux minutes, revint avec le collier et la croix. Et, se replaçant devant la glace d’un air de triomphe :","She pushed aside the blouse, disappeared for two minutes, returned with the necklace and the cross. And, returning to the mirror with an air of triumph:","She opened up her blouse, vanished for two minutes, and returned with the necklace and cross.","She folded back the chemisette, left the room for two minutes, and returned with the necklace and cross. Resuming her place in front of the mirror, she murmured triumphantly:"
"— Mais tu vas la roussir, dit Renée dont la voix avait des caresses maternelles.","""But you'll scorch her,"" said Renee, whose voice had maternal caresses.","“Be careful, you’re going to scorch it,” Renée said in a voice full of maternal tenderness.","‘You’ll scorch it,’ said Renée, whose voice sounded quite maternal."
"Puis, quand vint le printemps, Renée se rappela son ancienne élégie. Elle voulut que Maxime se promenât avec elle dans le parc Monceau, la nuit, au clair de la lune. Ils allèrent dans la grotte, s’assirent sur l’herbe, devant la colonnade. Mais lorsqu’elle témoigna le désir de faire une promenade sur le petit lac, ils s’aperçurent que la barque qu’on voyait de l’hôtel, attachée au bord d’une allée, n’avait pas de rames. On devait les retirer le soir. Ce fut une désillusion. D’ailleurs, les grandes ombres du parc inquiétaient les amants. Ils auraient souhaité qu’on y donnât une fête vénitienne, avec des ballons rouges et un orchestre. Ils le préféraient, le jour, l’après-midi, et souvent ils se mettaient alors à une des fenêtres de l’hôtel, pour voir les équipages qui suivaient la courbe savante de la grande allée. Ils se plaisaient à ce coin charmant du nouveau Paris, à cette nature aimable et propre, à ces pelouses pareilles à des pans de velours, coupées de corbeilles, d’arbustes choisis, et bordées de magnifiques roses blanches. Les voitures se croisaient là, aussi nombreuses que sur un boulevard ; les promeneuses y traînaient leurs jupes, mollement, comme si elles n’eussent pas quitté du pied les tapis de leurs salons. Et, à travers les feuillages, ils critiquaient les toilettes, se montraient les attelages, goûtaient de véritables douceurs aux couleurs tendres de ce grand jardin. Un bout de grille dorée brillait entre deux arbres, une file de canards passait sur le lac, le petit pont Renaissance blanchissait, tout neuf dans les verdures, tandis qu’aux deux bords de la grande allée, sur des chaises jaunes, les mères oubliaient en causant les petits garçons et les petites filles qui se regardaient d’un air joli, avec des moues d’enfants précoces.","Then, when spring came, Renee remembered her old elegy. She wanted Maxime to walk with her in the Parc Monceau at night, in the moonlight. They went into the grotto, sat down on the grass, in front of the colonnade. But when she expressed the desire to go for a walk on the little lake, they noticed that the boat that could be seen from the hotel, tied to the edge of an aisle, had no oars. We had to remove them in the evening. It was a disappointment. Besides, the great shadows in the park worried the lovers. They would have liked a Venetian party to be given there, with red balloons and an orchestra. They preferred it, during the day, in the afternoon, and often then they stood at one of the windows of the hotel, to see the carriages following the skilful curve of the main driveway. They took pleasure in this charming corner of the new Paris, in this pleasant and clean nature, in these lawns like patches of velvet, cut with baskets, selected shrubs, and bordered with magnificent white roses. Cars passed each other there, as numerous as on a boulevard; the strollers dragged their skirts there, limply, as if they had never taken their foot off the carpets of their drawing-rooms. And, through the foliage, they criticized the toilets, showed each other the teams, tasted real sweets in the tender colors of this large garden. A piece of gilded railing shone between two trees, a line of ducks passed over the lake, the little Renaissance bridge was white, brand new in the greenery, while on the two sides of the main path, on yellow chairs, the mothers forgot chatting with the little boys and girls who looked at each other with a pretty air, with the pouts of precocious children.","When spring came, Renée remembered her elegy of old. She insisted that Maxime accompany her into the Parc Monceau at night and stroll with her by moonlight. They went to the grotto and sat on the grass in front of the colonnade. But when she reminded him of her desire to row out on the little lake, they noticed that the boat that could be seen from the house moored alongside one of the paths had no oars. Apparently they were put away at night. This was a disappointment. The darkness of the park made the lovers nervous in any case. They would have preferred a Venetian festival with red balloons and an orchestra. They were more comfortable in daylight, in the afternoon, and they often stood at one of the windows of the house to watch the carriages round the pleasant curve of the main carriageway. They liked this charming section of new Paris, this lovely and clean patch of nature with its velvety lawns punctuated by beds of flowers and carefully selected shrubs and lined with splendid white roses. Carriages here were as thick as on the boulevards, and strolling ladies dragged their skirts along the ground as softly as if they had never left their carpeted salons. Peering through the foliage, the lovers criticized the women’s outfits, pointed out their carriages, and with genuine delight savored the soft colors of this huge garden. A section of gilded fence shone between two trees, a line of ducks glided along the lake, and the little Renaissance bridge with its fresh coat of white paint stood out amid the greenery, while mothers seated in yellow chairs on either side of the main path became so absorbed in conversation that they forgot about the little boys and girls precociously making eyes at one another.","Then, when springtime came, Renée’s feelings of melancholy returned. She made Maxime stroll with her at night in the Parc Monceau in the moonlight. They went into the grotto, and sat on the grass in front of the colonnade. But when she expressed a desire for a row on the little lake, they found that the boat they could see from the house, moored at the edge of a pathway, had no oars. These were evidently removed at night. This was a disappointment. Moreover, the great shadows in the gardens made the lovers anxious. They would have liked a Venetian carnival to be given there, with red lanterns and a band. They preferred it in the daytime, in the afternoon, and often they stood at one of the windows of the house to watch the carriages following the graceful curve of the main avenue. They enjoyed looking at this charming corner of the new Paris, this clean, pleasant bit of nature, these lawns like pieces of velvet, interspersed with flower-beds and shrubs, and bordered with magnificent white roses. Carriages passed by, as numerous as on the boulevards; the ladies on foot trailed their skirts languorously, as though they were walking across their drawing room carpets. They commented across the greenery on the different fashions, pointed to the horses, taking genuine pleasure in the soft colours of this great garden. A scrap of gilded railing flashed between two trees, a flock of ducks swam across the lake, the little Renaissance bridge stood out white and new amid the foliage, while on either side of the big avenue, mothers, sitting on yellow chairs, chatted and forgot their little boys and girls, who looked at each other coyly."

"Dans tout autre lieu, il lui aurait dit sans hésiter qu’il avait soupé le mercredi avec une dame, rencontrée sur le boulevard. Mais, depuis qu’il était entré dans le cabinet, il la traitait instinctivement en femme à laquelle il faut plaire et dont on doit ménager la jalousie.

"Et prenant le bras de son père, il remonta avec lui le boulevard. Il faisait une de ces claires nuits de gelée, où il est si bon de marcher sur la terre dure, dans l’air glacé. Saccard disait que Larsonneau avait tort, qu’il fallait être simplement le camarade de la d’Aurigny. Il partit de là pour déclarer que l’amour de ces filles était vraiment mauvais. Il se montrait moral, il trouvait des sentences, des conseils étonnants de sagesse.","And taking his father's arm, he went up the boulevard with him. It was one of those clear frosty nights when it is so good to walk on the hard earth, in the icy air. Saccard said that Larsonneau was wrong, that one should simply be the comrade of the d'Aurigny. He went from there to declare that the love of these girls was really bad. He showed himself to be moral, he found sentences, advice that was astonishingly wise.","Then, taking his father by the arm, he walked back up the boulevard alongside him. It was one of those clear, frosty nights when it is such a pleasure to walk on the hard ground in the frigid air. Saccard said that Larsonneau was making a mistake, that it was better to be the Aurigny woman’s friend than her lover. That led him to say that making love to whores of that sort was truly a bad idea. He presented himself as a moral authority, delivering himself of maxims and recommendations of astonishing propriety.","Taking his father by the arm, he walked up the boulevard with him.

"Saccard s’était permis, un jour, de consulter, chez le préfet, ce fameux plan de Paris sur lequel « une main auguste » avait tracé à l’encre rouge les principales voies du deuxième réseau. Ces sanglants traits de plume entaillaient Paris plus profondément encore que la main de l’agent voyer. Le boulevard Malesherbes, qui abattait des hôtels superbes, dans les rues d’Anjou et de la Ville-l’Évêque, et qui nécessitait des travaux de terrassement considérables, devait être troué un des premiers. Quand Saccard alla visiter l’immeuble de la rue de la Pépinière, il songea à cette soirée d’automne, à ce dîner qu’il avait fait avec Angèle sur les buttes Montmartre, et pendant lequel il était tombé, au soleil couchant, une pluie si drue de louis d’or sur le quartier de la Madeleine. Il sourit ; il pensa que le nuage radieux avait crevé chez lui, dans sa cour, et qu’il allait ramasser les pièces de vingt francs.","Saccard had taken the liberty, one day, of consulting, at the prefect's, this famous map of Paris on which ""an august hand"" had traced in red ink the main roads of the second network. These bloody strokes of the pen cut into Paris even more deeply than the hand of the agent voyer. The Boulevard Malesherbes, which demolished superb hotels in the Rues d'Anjou and Rue de la Ville-l'Évêque, and which required considerable earthworks, was to be one of the first to be perforated. When Saccard went to visit the building in the rue de la Pépinière, he thought of that autumn evening, of that dinner he had had with Angèle on the Montmartre hills, and during which he had fallen, at sunset, a heavy rain of louis d'or on the Madeleine district. He smiles ; he thought that the radiant cloud had burst in his house, in his courtyard, and that he was going to pick up the twenty-franc pieces.","Saccard had once taken the liberty of examining the famous map of Paris in the prefect’s office on which “an august hand” had traced in red ink the main roads of the second network.

The boulevard Malesherbes, which would require the demolition of any number of superb mansions on the rue d’Anjou and the rue de la Ville-l’Evêque as well as the construction of substantial embankments, was one of the first slated to be put through. When Saccard went to inspect the building on the rue de la Pépinière, he thought back on that autumn night, on that dinner he had eaten with Angèle on the Buttes Montmartre, during which showers of gold louis had rained on the neighborhood around the Madeleine at sunset. He smiled. The shining cloud had just burst over his head, above his courtyard, and he was soon to start scooping up those golden coins.","Saccard had ventured one day to consult, in the Prefect’s room, the famous plan of Paris on which ‘an august hand’ had traced in red ink the principal boulevards of the second network. * The blood-red pen-strokes cut even deeper gashes into Paris than did Saccard’s hand. The Boulevard Malesherbes, which was pulling down some magnificent houses in the Rue d’Anjou and the Rue de la Ville-l’Évêque, and necessitated extensive excavations, was to be one of the first to be laid out. When Saccard went to look over the property in the Rue de la Pépinière, he thought of his dinner with Angèle on the Buttes Montmartre, during which, at sunset, such a heavy shower of gold coins had fallen on the Madeleine district.

"Le matin, elle dormit un peu. Quand elle se réveilla, elle se crut malade. Elle fit fermer les rideaux, parla à son médecin de nausées et de douleurs de tête, refusa absolument de sortir pendant deux jours. Et, comme elle se prétendait assiégée, elle condamna sa porte. Maxime vint inutilement y frapper. Il ne couchait pas à l’hôtel, pour disposer plus librement de son appartement ; d’ailleurs, il menait la vie la plus nomade du monde, logeant dans les maisons neuves de son père, choisissant l’étage qui lui plaisait, déménageant tous les mois, souvent par caprice, parfois pour laisser la place à des locataires sérieux. Il essuyait les plâtres en compagnie de quelque maîtresse. Habitué aux caprices de sa belle-mère, il feignit une grande compassion, et monta quatre fois par jour demander de ses nouvelles avec des mines désolées, uniquement pour la taquiner. Le troisième jour, il la trouva dans le petit salon, rose, souriante, l’air calme et reposé.","In the morning she slept a little. When she woke up, she thought she was sick. She had the curtains closed, told her doctor about nausea and headaches, absolutely refused to go out for two days. And, as she pretended to be besieged, she condemned her door.

He did not sleep at the hotel, in order to dispose of his apartment more freely; moreover, he led the most nomadic life in the world, staying in his father's new houses, choosing the floor that pleased him, moving every month, often on a whim, sometimes to make room for serious tenants. He was wiping the plasters in the company of some mistress. Accustomed to the whims of his mother-in-law, he feigned great compassion, and went upstairs four times a day to ask after her with sorry looks, just to tease her.

"Et elle souriait, de son sourire vague de sphinx vicieux. Renée resta balbutiante. Elle ne comprenait pas, elle s’imagina que la bossue se moquait d’elle.

"Saccard inventa d’abord le tour des achats d’immeubles faits sous le manteau pour le compte de la Ville. Une décision du Conseil d’État créait à cette dernière une situation difficile. Elle avait acheté à l’amiable un grand nombre de maisons, espérant user les baux et congédier les locataires sans indemnité. Mais ces acquisitions furent considérées comme de véritables expropriations, et elle dut payer. Ce fut alors que Saccard offrit d’être le prête-nom de la Ville ; il achetait, usait les baux, et, moyennant un pot-de-vin, livrait l’immeuble au moment fixé. Et même il finit par jouer double jeu ; il achetait pour la Ville et pour le préfet. Quand l’affaire était par trop tentante, il escamotait la maison. L’État payait. On récompensa ses complaisances en lui concédant des bouts de rues, des carrefours projetés, qu’il rétrocédait avant même que la voie nouvelle fût commencée. C’était un jeu féroce ; on jouait sur les quartiers à bâtir comme on joue sur un titre de rente. Certaines dames, de jolies filles, amies intimes de hauts fonctionnaires, étaient de la partie ; une d’elles, dont les dents blanches sont célèbres, a croqué, à plusieurs reprises, des rues entières. Saccard s’affamait, sentait ses désirs s’accroître, à voir ce ruissellement d’or qui lui glissait entre les mains. Il lui semblait qu’une mer de pièces de vingt francs s’élargissait autour de lui, de lac devenait océan, emplissait l’immense horizon avec un bruit de vagues étrange, une musique métallique qui lui chatouillait le cœur ; et il s’aventurait, nageur plus hardi chaque jour, plongeant, reparaissant, tantôt sur le dos, tantôt sur le ventre, traversant cette immensité par les temps clairs et par les orages, comptant sur ses forces et son adresse pour ne jamais aller au fond.","Saccard first invented the trick of buying buildings under the cloak on behalf of the City. A decision by the Council of State created a difficult situation for the latter. She had bought a large number of houses out of court, hoping to use up the leases and dismiss the tenants without compensation. But these acquisitions were considered as real expropriations, and she had to pay. It was then that Saccard offered to be the town's figurehead; he bought, used the leases, and, for a bribe, delivered the building at the appointed time. And he even ends up playing a double game; he bought for the City and for the prefect. When the deal was too tempting, he stole the house. The state paid. He was rewarded for his kindness by granting him ends of streets, projected crossroads, which he retroceded even before the new road had begun. It was a fierce game; they gambled on the neighborhoods to be built as one gambles on an annuity title. Certain ladies, pretty girls, intimate friends of high functionaries, were in the game; one of them, whose white teeth are famous, has repeatedly crunched whole streets. Saccard was starving, felt his desires increase at seeing this stream of gold slipping through his hands. It seemed to him that a sea of twenty-franc pieces was spreading around him, from a lake becoming an ocean, filling the immense horizon with a strange sound of waves, a metallic music that tickled his heart; and he ventured, a bolder swimmer every day, diving, reappearing, sometimes on his back, sometimes on his stomach, crossing this immensity in clear weather and in storms, counting on his strength and his skill never to go to the bottom. bottom.","The first ploy he came up with was to buy buildings secretly on behalf of the city. A decision by the Conseil d’Etat had put the municipal government in a difficult position. It had purchased a large number of houses by private agreement with the owners in the hope of allowing the leases to expire and then evicting the tenants without any indemnity. But the council held that these purchases were in fact expropriations, and the city was obliged to pay. It was at that point that Saccard offered to act as a front. He bought the properties, ran out the leases, and in exchange for a bonus surrendered the buildings on a mutually agreed date. He even wound up playing a double game, buying for both the city and the prefect. When a deal proved too tempting, he slipped the deed for the property into his own pocket. The state paid. In compensation for his assistance he was granted building rights on sections of streets and planned intersections, which he sold to third parties even before work on the new street had begun. The game was fierce; people gambled on neighborhoods under construction as they might gamble on bonds. Certain ladies—pretty prostitutes, intimate friends of high officials—were in on the action. One of them, famous for the whiteness of her teeth, snapped up entire streets on several occasions. Saccard, famished, felt his desires grow as rivers of gold flowed through his hands. It seemed that a sea of twenty-franc coins was swelling before him, growing from a lake into an ocean whose waves stretched as far as the eye could see and made a strange sound, a metallic music that inflamed his heart. With each passing day he ventured more boldly out onto that sea, diving down and returning to the surface, now on his back, now on his belly, navigating the immensity in all weather, fair or foul, and counting on his strength and skill to avoid ever going to the bottom.","Saccard first invented the trick of making secret purchases of house property on the City’s account. A decision of the Council of State had placed the City in a difficult position. It had acquired by private contract a large number of houses, in the hope of running out the leases and turning the tenants out without compensation. But these purchases were pronounced to be genuine acts of expropriation, and the City had to pay. It was then that Saccard offered to lend his name to the City: he bought houses, ran out the leases, and for a consideration handed over the property at a fixed date. He even began to play a double game: he acted as buyer both for the City and for the Prefect. Whenever the deal was irresistibly tempting, he stuck to the house himself. The State paid. In return for his assistance he received building concessions for bits of streets, for open spaces, which he disposed of before the new boulevard was even begun. It was a tremendous gamble: the new neighbourhoods were speculated in as one speculates in stocks and shares. Certain ladies were involved, beautiful women, intimately connected with some of the prominent officials; one of them, whose white teeth are world-famous, has eaten up whole streets on more than one occasion. Saccard was insatiable, he felt his greed grow at the sight of the flood of gold that glided through his fingers. It seemed to him as if a sea of twenty-franc pieces stretched out around him, swelling from a lake to an ocean, filling the vast horizon with a strange sound of waves, a metallic music that tickled his heart; and he grew bolder, plunging deeper every day, diving and coming up again, now on his back, now on his belly, swimming through this great expanse in fair weather and foul, and relying on his strength and skill to prevent him from ever sinking to the bottom."
— Dis ?…,- Say ?…,. . .,"Then, as he had opened the door, he lowered his voice to add:"
"Cependant Aristide Saccard ne s’inquiétait guère des deux enfants, comme il nommait son fils et sa seconde femme. Il leur laissait une liberté absolue, heureux de les voir bons amis, ce qui emplissait l’appartement d’une gaieté bruyante. Singulier appartement que ce premier étage de la rue de Rivoli. Les portes y battaient toute la journée ; les domestiques y parlaient haut ; le luxe neuf et éclatant en était traversé continuellement par des courses de jupes énormes et volantes, par des processions de fournisseurs, par le tohu-bohu des amies de Renée, des camarades de Maxime et des visiteurs de Saccard. Ce dernier recevait, de neuf heures à onze heures, le plus étrange monde qu’on pût voir : sénateurs et clercs d’huissier, duchesses et marchandes à la toilette, toute l’écume que les tempêtes de Paris jetaient le matin à sa porte, robes de soie, jupes sales, blouses, habits noirs, qu’il accueillait du même ton pressé, des mêmes gestes impatients et nerveux ; il bâclait les affaires en deux paroles, résolvait vingt difficultés à la fois, et donnait les solutions en courant. On eût dit que ce petit homme remuant, dont la voix était très forte, se battait dans son cabinet avec les gens, avec les meubles, culbutait, se frappait la tête au plafond pour en faire jaillir les idées, et retombait toujours victorieux sur ses pieds. Puis, à onze heures, il sortait ; on ne le voyait plus de la journée ; il déjeunait dehors, souvent même il y dînait. Alors la maison appartenait à Renée et à Maxime ; ils s’emparaient du cabinet du père ; ils y déballaient les cartons des fournisseurs, et les chiffons traînaient sur les dossiers. Parfois des gens graves attendaient une heure à la porte du cabinet, pendant que le collégien et la jeune femme discutaient un nœud de ruban, assis aux deux bouts du bureau de Saccard. Renée faisait atteler dix fois par jour. Rarement on mangeait ensemble ; sur les trois, deux couraient, s’oubliaient, ne revenaient qu’à minuit. Appartement de tapage, d’affaires et de plaisirs, où la vie moderne, avec son bruit d’or sonnant, de toilettes froissées, s’engouffrait comme un coup de vent.","However Aristide Saccard was hardly worried about the two children, as he called his son and his second wife. He left them absolute freedom, happy to see them good friends, which filled the apartment with a noisy gaiety. Singular apartment that this first floor of the rue de Rivoli. The doors banged there all day long; the servants talked loudly there; the new and dazzling luxury was continually traversed by races of enormous and flying skirts, by processions of suppliers, by the hustle and bustle of Renee's friends, Maxime's comrades and Saccard's visitors. The latter received, from nine o'clock to eleven o'clock, the strangest people one could see: senators and bailiff's clerks, duchesses and merchants in their toilets, all the foam that the storms of Paris threw at his door in the morning. , silk dresses, dirty skirts, blouses, black coats, which he received in the same hurried tone, with the same impatient and nervous gestures; he shuffled things off in two words, solved twenty difficulties at once, and gave the solutions on the run. One would have said that this restless little man, whose voice was very strong, was fighting in his study with people, with furniture, tumbling, banging his head on the ceiling to make ideas spring from it, and always falling back victorious on his feet. Then, at eleven o'clock, he went out; he was not seen all day; he lunched outside, often even dined there. So the house belonged to Renee and Maxime; they seized the father's closet; there they unpacked the suppliers' boxes, and the rags lay on the files. Sometimes serious people waited for an hour at the door of the study, while the schoolboy and the young woman discussed a ribbon bow, seated at the two ends of Saccard's desk. Renée had her harnessed ten times a day. We rarely ate together; of the three, two ran away, forgot each other, did not return until midnight. An apartment of noise, business and pleasure, where modern life, with its sound of ringing gold, of crumpled toilets, rushed in like a gust of wind.","Meanwhile, Aristide Saccard spent little time worrying about the “two children,” as he called his son and his second wife. He granted them absolute freedom, glad to see that they were good friends who filled the apartment with boisterous gaiety. The second-floor flat on the rue de Rivoli was a place of unusual activity. Doors were swinging all day long. The servants spoke in loud voices. Billowing skirts swept constantly through the dazzling luxury of the brand-new rooms, along with processions of purveyors and gaggles of Renée’s friends, Maxime’s classmates, and Saccard’s visitors. From nine until eleven in the morning Saccard received the strangest assemblage of characters imaginable: senators and court clerks, duchesses and rag dealers— whatever flotsam the Parisian tempest dumped on his doorstep each morning, whether clad in silk gowns, filthy skirts, workmen’s smocks, or dark frock coats—and he received each one with the same clipped tones and impatient, nervous gestures. He dispatched business deals with a couple of words, dealt with twenty difficulties at once, and proposed solutions on the fly. It sometimes sounded as though this energetic little man with the very loud voice was fighting with people in his study, or with the furniture, turning somersaults and knocking his head against the ceiling to jar ideas loose before landing on his feet, ever victorious. Then, at eleven o’clock, he went out and was not seen again for the rest of the day. He took his lunch out and often his dinner as well. Then the house belonged to Renée and Maxime. They took over the old man’s study and unpacked the boxes from the stores, and articles of clothing were left lying on top of business files. There were times when grave men were obliged to wait for an hour outside the door of the study while the schoolboy and the young wife, seated at either end of Saccard’s desk, argued about a bow of ribbon. Renée ordered the horses hitched up ten times a day. The family seldom took meals together. Two of the three were always on the run somewhere, too absorbed in whatever they were doing to return before midnight. It was an apartment noisy with business and pleasure, where modern life rushed in like a gust of wind, accompanied by the clink of gold and the rustle of gowns.","Meanwhile Saccard hardly troubled himself about the two children, as he called his son and his second wife. He left them in complete freedom, glad to see them such good friends. The apartment was thus filled with noise and merriment. It was an amazing apartment, this first floor in the Rue de Rivoli. There was a slamming of doors all day long; the servants talked in loud voices; its new and dazzling luxury was continually traversed by a flood of vast, floating skirts, by processions of tradespeople, by the noise of Renée’s friends, Maxime’s schoolfellows, and Saccard’s callers. From nine to eleven Saccard received the strangest set imaginable: senators and bailiffs’ clerks, duchesses and old-clothes women, all the scum that the streets of Paris hurled at his door every morning, silk gowns, dirty skirts, workmen’s blouses, dress-coats, all of whom he received in the same breathless manner, with the same impatient, nervous gestures; he clinched business arrangements with a brief command, solved twenty problems at once, and gave orders on the run. One would have thought that this restless little man with the very loud voice was fighting with people in his study, and with the furniture, tumbling head over heels, knocking his head against the ceiling to make his ideas flash out, and always falling triumphantly on his feet. At eleven o’clock he would go out; he was not seen again during the day; he breakfasted out, often he even dined out. Then the house belonged to Renée and Maxime: they took possession of the father’s study; they unpacked the tradesmen’s parcels there, and articles of finery lay about among the business papers. Sometimes people had to wait for an hour at the study door while the schoolboy and the young married woman discussed a bow of ribbon, seated at either end of Saccard’s writing-table. Renée had the horses put to ten times a day. They rarely had a meal together; two of the three would be rushing about, forgetting themselves, staying out till midnight. An apartment full of noise, business, and pleasure, through which modern life, with the sound of jingling gold and rustling skirts, swept like a whirlwind."
"— Il remue, il remue, dit joyeusement un des industriels.","""He's moving, he's moving,"" said one of the industrialists happily.","Then, after a few seconds of anxious waiting, one of the businessmen gleefully shouted, “It’s moving, it’s moving!”","‘It’s moving, it’s moving.’"
"Elle glissa, elle disparut. Renée ne l’entendit même pas fermer la porte. Elle resta là, devant le feu qui mourait, continuant le rêve de la journée, la tête pleine de chiffres dansants, entendant au loin les voix de Saccard et de Mme Sidonie dialoguer, lui offrir des sommes considérables, du ton dont un commissaire-priseur met un mobilier aux enchères. Elle sentait sur son cou le baiser brutal de son mari, et quand elle se retournait, c’était la courtière qu’elle trouvait à ses pieds, avec sa robe noire, son visage mou, lui tenant des discours passionnés, lui vantant ses perfections, implorant un rendez-vous d’amour, avec l’attitude d’un amant à bout de résignation. Cela la faisait sourire. La chaleur, dans la pièce, devenait de plus en plus étouffante. Et la stupeur de la jeune femme, les rêves bizarres qu’elle faisait, n’étaient qu’un sommeil léger, un sommeil artificiel, au fond duquel elle revoyait toujours le petit cabinet du boulevard, le large divan où elle était tombée à genoux. Elle ne souffrait plus du tout. Quand elle ouvrait les paupières, Maxime passait dans le brasier rose.","She slipped, she disappeared. Renee didn't even hear him close the door. She remained there, in front of the dying fire, continuing the dream of the day, her head full of dancing figures, hearing in the distance the voices of Saccard and Madame Sidonie conversing, offering her considerable sums, in the tone of which an auctioneer auction off furniture. She felt her husband's brutal kiss on her neck, and when she turned around, it was the broker she found at her feet, with her black dress, her soft face, giving her passionate speeches, boasting to her of her perfections. , imploring a love rendezvous, with the attitude of a lover at the end of resignation. It made her smile. The heat in the room grew more and more oppressive. And the stupor of the young woman, the bizarre dreams she was having, were only a light sleep, an artificial sleep, in the depths of which she always saw the little office on the boulevard, the wide divan where she had fallen on her knees. . She was no longer in pain at all. When she opened her eyelids, Maxime passed through the pink brazier.","She slipped out and disappeared. Renée didn’t even hear her close the door.

On her neck she could still feel her husband’s brutal kiss, and when she turned around there was the businesswoman at her feet, with her black dress and pasty face, making passionate speeches to her, extolling her perfections, begging her for a tryst in the posture of a lover on the brink of despair. This made her smile. The heat in the room was more and more stifling. And the young woman’s stupor and bizarre dreams were merely the products of a light and artificial sleep, and behind that thin veil she could still see the small private room on the boulevard and the wide divan next to which she had fallen to her knees. She had ceased to suffer altogether. When she opened her eyes, Maxime flitted through the rosy firelight.","She glided out of sight. Renée did not even hear her close the door. She stayed there before the dying fire, still dreaming, her head full of dancing figures, hearing the distant voices of Saccard and Madame Sidonie offering her large sums of money, like an auctioneer putting up a lot of furniture. She felt her husband’s rough kiss on her neck, and when she turned round she imagined the businesswoman at her feet, with her black dress and her flaccid face, making passionate speeches to her, praising her perfections, and begging for an assignation like a lover on the verge of despair.

"— Non, ne viens pas. Tu m’attendras avec un fiacre, sur le boulevard Malesherbes. Je sortirai par le jardin.","""No, don't come. You will be waiting for me in a cab, on the Boulevard Malesherbes.

I’ll go out through the garden.”","‘No, don’t come here. Wait for me in a cab on the Boulevard Malesherbes. I’ll leave through the garden.’"

"Les treize ans de Maxime étaient déjà terriblement savants. C’était une de ces natures frêles et hâtives, dans lesquelles les sens poussent de bonne heure. Le vice en lui parut même avant l’éveil des désirs. À deux reprises, il faillit se faire chasser du collège. Renée, avec des yeux habitués aux grâces provinciales, aurait vu que, tout fagoté qu’il était, le petit tondu, comme elle le nommait, souriait, tournait le cou, avançait les bras d’une façon gentille, de cet air féminin des demoiselles de collège. Il se soignait beaucoup les mains, qu’il avait minces et longues ; si ses cheveux restaient courts, par ordre du proviseur, ancien colonel du génie, il possédait un petit miroir qu’il tirait de sa poche, pendant les classes, qu’il posait entre les pages de son livre, et dans lequel il se regardait des heures entières, s’examinant les yeux, les gencives, se faisant des mines, s’apprenant des coquetteries. Ses camarades se pendaient à sa blouse, comme à une jupe, et il se serrait tellement, qu’il avait la taille mince, le balancement de hanches d’une femme faite. La vérité était qu’il recevait autant de coups que de caresses. Le collège de Plassans, un repaire de petits bandits comme la plupart des collèges de province, fut ainsi un milieu de souillure, dans lequel se développa singulièrement ce tempérament neutre, cette enfance qui apportait le mal, d’on ne savait quel inconnu héréditaire. L’âge allait heureusement le corriger. Mais la marque de ses abandons d’enfant, cette effémination de tout son être, cette heure où il s’était cru fille, devait rester en lui, le frapper à jamais dans sa virilité.","Maxime's thirteen years were already terribly learned. He was one of those frail and hasty natures in which the senses grow early. The vice in him appeared even before the awakening of desires. Twice he nearly got kicked out of school. Renée, with eyes accustomed to provincial graces, would have seen that, dowdy as he was, the little shaved one, as she called him, was smiling, turning his neck, stretching out his arms in a kind way, with that feminine air of college damsels. He took great care of his hands, which were thin and long; if his hair was kept short, by order of the headmaster, a former colonel of engineers, he had a small mirror which he took out of his pocket during classes, which he placed between the pages of his book, and in which he looked at himself whole hours, examining each other's eyes, gums, making faces, teaching each other coquetry. His comrades hung from his blouse, as from a skirt, and he was so tight that he had the slender waist, the swaying hips of a mature woman. The truth was that he received as many blows as caresses. The college of Plassans, a haunt of small bandits like most provincial colleges, was thus an environment of defilement, in which singularly developed this neutral temperament, this childhood which brought evil, from who knew what hereditary unknown. Fortunately, age would correct him. But the mark of his childhood abandonment, this effemination of his whole being, this hour when he thought he was a girl, was to remain in him, to strike him forever in his virility.","For a boy of thirteen, Maxime was already terribly knowing. His was one of those frail and precocious natures in which the senses assert themselves early. He had vices before he had desires. On two occasions he nearly got himself expelled from school. Had Renée been attuned to provincial graces, she might have noticed that, as odd as his appearance was, the “little shaved skull,” as she called him, smiled, turned his head, and held out his arm in the dainty, effeminate manner of those schoolboys who beguile their classmates with their charms. He took great care with his hands, which were slender and long. Although his hair was cut short by order of the headmaster, a former colonel in the Engineers, he possessed a small mirror, which he used to take from his pocket during class and place between the pages of his book so that he could stare at himself for hours on end, examining his eyes and gums, making faces, and teaching himself to flirt. His classmates clutched at his school uniform as if it were a skirt, and he pulled his belt so tight that he had the thin waist and swaying hips of a grown woman. The truth was that he took beatings from his classmates as often as he received their caresses. The school in Plassans, like most provincial boarding schools a den of young bandits, thus proved a hotbed of corruption that developed Maxime’s neutered temperament in unusual ways, fostering the evil that had come down to him from some mysterious hereditary source. Fortunately, age was about to straighten him out. But the mark of his youthful surrenders, of the effeminization of his entire being during this period in which he had thought of himself as a girl, would remain with him and cripple his virility for good.","Maxime was already terribly knowing for his thirteen years. His was one of those frail, precocious natures in which the senses assert themselves early. He had vices before he knew the meaning of desire. He had twice narrowly escaped being expelled from school. Had Renée’s eyes been accustomed to provincial graces, she would have noticed that, strangely got up though he was, the little man, as she called him, had a way of smiling, of turning his head, of stretching his arms, that had the feminine air of adolescent schoolgirls. He took great pains to look after his hands, which were long and slender; and though his hair was cropped short by order of the principal, an excolonel of engineers, he owned a little looking-glass which he took out of his pocket during classes and placed between the leaves of his book, looking at himself for hours, examining his eyes, his gums, pulling pretty faces, training himself in the art of coquetry. His schoolfriends hung round his blouse as round a petticoat, and he buckled his belt so tightly that he had the slim waist and swaying hips of a woman. In truth, however, he received as many kicks as kisses. The school at Plassans, a den of young delinquents like most provincial schools, was a hotbed of pollution that singularly developed his epicene temperament, his childhood marked by evil from some mysterious hereditary cause. Fortunately, age was about to improve him. But the sign of his boyish debauchery, this effeminization of his whole being during the time when he played at being a girl, was destined to remain in him and to strike a lasting blow to his virility."
"Depuis un instant, la vue de Maxime et de Louise, comme elle traversait une allée, avait brusquement arrêté la jeune femme derrière un arbuste. Autour d’elle, la serre chaude, pareille à une nef d’église, et dont de minces colonnettes de fer montaient d’un jet soutenir le vitrail cintré, étalait ses végétations grasses, ses nappes de feuilles puissantes, ses fusées épanouies de verdure.","For a moment, the sight of Maxime and Louise, as she was crossing an alley, had suddenly stopped the young woman behind a shrub. Around her, the hothouse, like the nave of a church, from which slender iron columns shot up to support the arched stained-glass window, spread out its lush vegetation, its sheets of powerful leaves, its blooming flares of greenery. .","A moment earlier, while crossing one of the conservatory walkways, Renée had caught sight of Maxime and Louise and stopped abruptly behind a bush.

"Renée leva la tête. L’apparition avait disparu, un flot de foule encombrait la porte. Depuis cette soirée, elle revint souvent aux Tuileries, elle eut même l’honneur d’être complimentée à voix haute par Sa Majesté, et de devenir un peu son amie ; mais elle se rappela toujours la marche lente et alourdie du prince au milieu du salon, entre les deux rangées d’épaules ; et, quand elle goûtait quelque joie nouvelle dans la fortune grandissante de son mari, elle revoyait l’empereur dominant les gorges inclinées, venant à elle, la comparant à un œillet que le vieux général lui conseillait de mettre à sa boutonnière.","Renee looked up.

And as her husband’s fortune grew, whenever she experienced some new joy, she recalled the image of the Emperor towering over the bowed bosoms, coming toward her, and comparing her to a carnation, which the old general advised him to put in his buttonhole.","Renée looked up.

"Et il le lui conta, sans attendre la réponse. Il le pénétrait de plus en plus, il le commentait, il finissait par le trouver exquis de naïveté. « J’en ai un bien plus joli dessous ! » C’était un cri du cœur.","And he told it to her, without waiting for an answer. He penetrated it more and more, he commented on it, he ended up finding it exquisitely naive. “I have a much prettier one underneath! It was a cry from the heart.","he asked. And without waiting for Mussy’s answer, he repeated it. His appreciation of the lady’s wit had only increased in the interim. He offered his own commentary, ending with the compliment that the remark was exquisite in its simplicity. “I have a much prettier one underneath.” It was a cry from the heart.","Without waiting for a reply, he told him the story. He appreciated it more and more, made comments on it, and ended by thinking it exquisitely ingenuous. ‘I’ve got a much prettier one underneath!’ It was a cry from the heart."
"Il faisait, entre les deux bûches qui flambaient, une petite montagne de braise, ramassant délicatement, du bout des pincettes, les plus minces fragments de charbon, regardant d’un air satisfait s’élever cette butte qu’il construisait avec un art infini.","Between the two flaming logs, he made a small mountain of embers, delicately picking up, with the tips of the tweezers, the thinnest fragments of coal, watching with a satisfied air rise this mound which he was building with infinite art. .","Between the two burning logs he made a small pile of embers, delicately picking up the tiniest pieces of charcoal with the ends of the tongs and contemplating with an air of satisfaction the heap he was constructing with infinite skill.","He was building up between the two flaming logs a little mountain of embers, picking up daintily with the tongs the smallest fragments of burnt wood, looking pleased with the mound he was skilfully constructing."
"Elle le poussa plus profondément dans le noir des feuillages, en disant, les mains jointes, prise d’une terreur croissante :","She pushed him deeper into the blackness of the foliage, saying, her hands clasped, seized with increasing terror:","She pushed him farther into the darkness of the foliage, clasping her hands and pleading with growing terror, “I beg you, Maxime . . .”","She pushed him further into the gloom of the foliage and said, with clasped hands:"

"Depuis le commencement du dîner, Renée semblait distraite. Elle remplissait ses devoirs de maîtresse de maison avec un sourire machinal. À chaque éclat de gaieté qui venait du bout de la table, où Maxime et Louise, côte à côte, plaisantaient comme de bons camarades, elle jetait de ce côté un regard luisant. Elle s’ennuyait. Les hommes graves l’assommaient. Mme d’Espanet et Mme Haffner lui lançaient des regards désespérés.","Since the beginning of dinner, Renee seemed distracted. She fulfilled her duties as mistress of the house with a mechanical smile.

"C’était comme le coin enchanté d’une cité des Mille et une Nuits, aux arbres d’émeraude, aux toits de saphir, aux girouettes de rubis.

"Renée aimait ce petit salon, dont une des portes-fenêtres s’ouvrait sur la magnifique serre chaude scellée au flanc de l’hôtel. Dans la journée, elle y passait ses heures d’oisiveté. Les tentures jaunes, au lieu d’éteindre sa chevelure pâle, la doraient de flammes étranges ; sa tête se détachait au milieu d’une lueur d’aurore, toute rose et blanche, comme celle d’une Diane blonde s’éveillant dans la lumière du matin ; et c’était pourquoi, sans doute, elle aimait cette pièce qui mettait sa beauté en relief.","Renée liked this little salon, one of whose French windows opened onto the magnificent hothouse sealed to the side of the hotel. During the day, she spent her idle hours there. The yellow hangings, instead of extinguishing her pale hair, gilded her with strange flames; her head stood out in the midst of a gleam of dawn, all pink and white, like that of a blond Diana waking up in the morning light; and that was why, no doubt, she loved this piece which brought out her beauty.","Renée loved this little salon, one of whose French doors opened onto the magnificent conservatory attached to the side of the mansion. During the day this was where she spent her idle hours. The yellow hangings did not outshine her pale blonde hair but rather lent it a strange golden glow.

No doubt that was why she loved this room, which highlighted her beauty.","Renée loved this little room, one of whose glass doors opened into the magnificent hothouse at the side of the house.

"Quelques convives arrivèrent encore. Il y avait au moins une trentaine de personnes dans le salon. Les conversations reprirent ; pendant les moments de silence, on entendait, derrière les murs, des bruits légers de vaisselle et d’argenterie. Enfin, Baptiste ouvrit une porte à deux battants, et, majestueusement, il dit la phrase sacramentelle :","A few more guests arrived. There were at least thirty people in the living room. The conversations resumed; during the moments of silence, one could hear, behind the walls, the light sounds of crockery and silverware. Finally, Baptiste opened a double door, and, majestically, he said the sacramental phrase:","Still more guests arrived. At least thirty people were now gathered in the salon. Conversation resumed. During the moments of silence, faint sounds of china and silver could be heard on the other side of the wall.

Conversation was resumed; in moments of silence the faint clatter of silver and crockery could be heard through the walls. At last Baptiste opened the folding doors and majestically uttered the sacramental phrase:
"Cette liberté entière, cette impunité les enhardissaient encore. S’ils poussaient les verrous la nuit, ils s’embrassaient le jour dans toutes les pièces de l’hôtel. Ils inventèrent mille petits jeux, par les temps de pluie. Mais le grand régal de Renée était toujours de faire un feu terrible et de s’assoupir devant le brasier. Elle eut, cet hiver-là, un luxe de linge merveilleux. Elle porta des chemises et des peignoirs d’un prix fou, dont les entre-deux et la batiste la couvraient à peine d’une fumée blanche. Et, dans la lueur rouge du brasier, elle restait, comme nue, les dentelles et la peau roses, la chair baignée par la flamme à travers l’étoffe mince. Maxime, accroupi à ses pieds, lui baisait les genoux, sans même sentir le linge qui avait la tiédeur et la couleur de ce beau corps. Le jour était bas, il tombait pareil à un crépuscule dans la chambre de soie grise, tandis que Céleste allait et venait derrière eux, de son pas tranquille. Elle était devenue leur complice, naturellement. Un matin qu’ils s’étaient oubliés au lit, elle les y trouva, et garda son flegme de servante au sang glacé. Ils ne se gênaient plus, elle entrait à toute heure, sans que le bruit de leurs baisers lui fît tourner la tête. Ils comptaient sur elle pour les prévenir en cas d’alerte. Ils n’achetaient pas son silence. C’était une fille très économe, très honnête, et à laquelle on ne connaissait pas d’amant.","This complete liberty, this impunity emboldened them still further. If they pushed the locks at night, they kissed during the day in all the rooms of the hotel. They invented a thousand little games, in rainy weather. But Renée's great delight was always to make a terrible fire and doze before the brazier. That winter she had a marvelous luxury of linen. She wore insanely expensive shirts and dressing gowns, the insets and cambric of which barely covered her with white smoke. And, in the red glow of the brazier, she remained, as if naked, her lace and her skin pink, her flesh bathed in flame through the thin fabric. Maxime, squatting at her feet, kissed her knees, without even feeling the linen which had the warmth and color of her beautiful body. The day was low, it was falling like dusk in the gray silken room, while Celeste came and went behind them, with her quiet step. She had become their accomplice, of course. One morning when they had forgotten each other in bed, she found them there, and retained her cool-blooded servant's phlegm. They no longer bothered each other, she came in at any time, without the sound of their kisses making her turn her head. They counted on her to warn them in case of an alert. They weren't buying his silence. She was a very thrifty, very honest girl, and for whom no lover was known.","Such utter freedom and impunity emboldened them still more. If they bolted their door at night, by day they kissed in every room in the house. They invented countless little games to while away the time on rainy days. But Renée’s greatest delight was still to make a roaring fire and nap in front of the fireplace. That winter she had a marvelous array of linen to choose from. Her chemises and peignoirs cost a king’s ransom, and their frilly lace and batiste barely covered her with a white cloud. She lay almost naked in the red glow of the fireplace, her lace and skin tinted pink, her flesh warmed through the thin fabric by the heat of the flames. Maxime, crouching at her feet, could kiss her knees without so much as feeling the garment, which shared the warmth and color of her beautiful body. When the sky was overcast, a dusky gloom enveloped the gray silk-lined bedroom, while Céleste quietly padded in and out behind the two lovers. She had of course become their accomplice. When they lingered in bed one morning, she found them there yet betrayed no emotion, as if her veins were filled with ice water. After that they cast all caution to the winds, and Céleste came in at all hours, never allowing the sound of their kisses to distract her from her work. They relied on her to warn them of any danger. They did not buy her silence. She was a very thrifty girl, very respectable, and if she had ever had a lover, no one knew about it.","This complete sense of freedom and impunity emboldened them still further. They bolted the door at night, but in the daytime they kissed in every room in the house. On rainy days they invented a thousand little games. But Renée’s great delight was still to make an enormous fire and doze off before the grate. Her linen was marvellously luxurious that winter. She wore vastly expensive chemises and dressing gowns, whose cambric and lace insertions barely covered her with a cloud of white smoke. In the red glow of the fire she lay as though naked, with pink lace and skin, the heat penetrating through the thin stuff to her flesh. Maxime, crouched at her feet, kissed her knees without even feeling the cambric, which had the warmth and colour of her beautiful body. The daylight hardly came in, it fell like twilight into the grey silk room, while Céleste went quietly to and fro behind them. She had become their natural accomplice. One morning, when they had overslept, she discovered them together but remained utterly impassive. They then abandoned all restraint, she came in at all hours without the sound of their kisses causing her to turn her head. They relied on her to warn them in case of danger. They did not buy her silence. She was a very economical, respectable girl, and had never been known to have a lover."
"Et, en effet, la loupe montra un léger fil d’or qui s’était égaré des sourcils et qui était descendu jusqu’au milieu du nez. Ce poil les amusa longtemps.","And, indeed, the magnifying glass showed a thin thread of gold which had strayed from the eyebrows and which had come down to the middle of the nose. This hair amused them for a long time.","And in fact the lens did reveal a thin golden filament, which had fallen from an eyebrow onto the middle of the nose. This hair amused the two of them for quite some time.","In fact the glass did reveal a thin golden thread, which had strayed from the eyebrows down to the middle of the nose.

"Puis le mari avança. Un besoin de brutalité marbrait sa face, il serrait les poings pour assommer les coupables. La colère, dans ce petit homme remuant, éclatait avec des bruits de coups de feu. Il eut un ricanement étranglé, et, s’approchant toujours :","Then the husband came forward. A need for brutality marred his face, he clenched his fists to knock out the culprits. The anger in this restless little man burst out with the sound of gunfire. He gave a strangled chuckle, and still approaching:","Then the husband moved forward into the room.

His face was red with rage, he clenched his fists to strike the guilty pair. His anger burst forth like gunfire. He gave a strangled laugh, and coming closer, said:"
"Et comme elle se penchait pour repousser la table, il la baisa rudement sur le cou. Elle jeta un petit cri. Puis elle se leva, frémissante, tâchant de rire, songeant invinciblement aux baisers de l’autre, la veille. Mais il eut regret de ce baiser de cocher. Il la quitta, en lui serrant amicalement la main, et en lui promettant qu’elle aurait les cinquante mille francs le soir même. Renée sommeilla toute la journée devant le feu. Aux heures de crise, elle avait des langueurs de créole. Alors, toute sa turbulence devenait paresseuse, frileuse, endormie. Elle grelottait, il lui fallait des brasiers ardents, une chaleur suffocante qui lui mettait au front de petites gouttes de sueur, et qui l’assoupissait. Dans cet air brûlant, dans ce bain de flammes, elle ne souffrait presque plus ; sa douleur devenait comme un songe léger, un vague oppressement, dont l’indécision même finissait par être voluptueuse. Ce fut ainsi qu’elle berça jusqu’au soir ses remords de la veille, dans la clarté rouge du foyer, en face d’un terrible feu qui faisait craquer les meubles autour d’elle, et lui ôtait, par instants, la conscience de son être. Elle put songer à Maxime, comme à une jouissance enflammée dont les rayons la brûlaient ; elle eut un cauchemar d’étranges amours, au milieu de bûchers, sur des lits chauffés à blanc. Céleste allait et venait, dans la chambre, avec sa figure calme de servante au sang glacé. Elle avait l’ordre de ne laisser entrer personne ; elle congédia même les inséparables, Adeline d’Espanet et Suzanne Haffner, de retour d’un déjeuner qu’elles venaient de faire ensemble, dans un pavillon loué par elles à Saint-Germain. Cependant, vers le soir, Céleste étant venue dire à sa maîtresse que Mme Sidonie, la sœur de monsieur, voulait lui parler, elle reçut l’ordre de l’introduire.","And as she leaned over to push the table away, he kissed her roughly on the neck. She let out a little cry. Then she got up, quivering, trying to laugh, dreaming invincibly of the other's kisses the night before. But he was sorry for that coachman's kiss. He left her, shaking her hand in a friendly way, and promising her that she would have the fifty thousand francs the same evening. Renee dozed all day in front of the fire. In times of crisis, she had Creole languor. Then all his turbulence became lazy, chilly, sleepy. She was shivering, she needed blazing braziers, a suffocating heat which put little drops of sweat on her forehead and made her drowsy. In this burning air, in this bath of flames, she hardly suffered any more; her pain became like a light dream, a vague oppression, the very indecision of which ended by being voluptuous. It was thus that she cradled her remorse of the night before until evening, in the red light of the hearth, in front of a terrible fire which made the furniture around her creak, and at times took away her consciousness. of his being. She could think of Maxime as of a fiery enjoyment whose rays burned her; she had a nightmare of strange loves, in the middle of pyres, on white-hot beds. Celeste walked back and forth in the room, with her calm face of a servant with frozen blood. She had orders not to let anyone in; she even dismissed the inseparable ones, Adeline d'Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, on their return from a lunch they had just had together, in a pavilion rented by them in Saint-Germain. However, towards evening, Celeste having come to tell her mistress that Madame Sidonie, Monsieur's sister, wished to speak to her, she received orders to introduce her.","And as she bent forward to push the table away, he kissed her roughly on the neck. She uttered a little cry. Then she got up, shaking, attempting to laugh, and thinking invincibly of the other man’s kisses of the night before. Saccard, meanwhile, regretted having kissed her like a coachman. In leaving he gave her hand a friendly squeeze and promised that he would have 50,000 francs for her that night. Renée slept all day in front of the fire. In critical moments she could be as listless as a Creole. All her restless energy turned to laziness, nervous agitation, and numbness. She shivered, she needed a roaring fire, a suffocating heat that raised little drops of sweat on her forehead and made her drowsy. In this scorching climate, this bath of flames, her suffering almost ended. Her pain became a weightless dream, a vague sense of oppression, whose very ambiguity ultimately came to seem voluptuous. In this way, until evening arrived, she assuaged her remorse of the night before in the red glow of the fireplace, before a raging fire that caused the furniture around her to crack and at times left her unconscious of her existence. She was able to think of Maxime as of a searing ecstasy whose rays scorched her. She had a nightmare of strange loves atop flaming pyres, on white-hot beds. Céleste came and went, wearing the calm face of a servant with ice water in her veins. She had orders to admit no one. She even turned away “the Inseparables,” Adeline d’Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, who stopped by on their way back from lunch in a country house they had rented together in Saint-Germain. Toward evening, however, when Céleste came to inform her mistress that Monsieur’s sister Mme Sidonie wished to see her, she received orders to show the lady in.","As she bent forward to push away the table, he kissed her roughly on the neck. She gave a little cry. Then she stood up, quivering, trying to laugh, thinking in spite of herself of Maxime’s kisses the night before. But Saccard seemed to regret this unmannerly kiss. He left her, squeezing her hand, and promised she would have the fifty thousand francs that evening. Renée dozed all day before the fire. At times of crisis she had the languor of a Creole. Her turbulent nature would then become indolent, chilled, numbed. She shivered, she needed blazing fires, stifling heat that brought little drops of perspiration to her forehead and soothed her. In this burning atmosphere, in this bath of flames, she almost ceased to suffer; her pain became like a light dream, a vague oppression whose very vagueness became pleasurable. Thus she lulled till the evening the remorse of the day before, in the red glow of the firelight, in front of a terrible fire that made the furniture crack around her and at times made her quite unconscious of her existence. She was able to think of Maxime as of a flaming pleasure whose rays burnt her; she had a nightmare of strange passions amid flaring logs on white-hot beds. Céleste moved to and fro through the room, with her calm face, the face of a cold-blooded waiting-maid. She had orders to admit no one, she even sent away the inseparables, Adeline d’Espanet and Suzanne Haffner, who called after breakfasting together in a summer house they rented at Saint-Germain. However, when, towards the evening, Céleste came to tell her mistress that Madame Sidonie, Monsieur’s sister, was asking to see her, she was told to show her up."
"— D’où venez-vous donc ? leur disait-elle. Vous sentez la pipe et le musc… C’est sûr, je vais avoir la migraine.","""So where do you come from?"" she told them. You smell the pipe and the musk... It's sure, I'm going to have a migraine.",“So where are you coming from?” she would say. “You reek of tobacco and perfume. . . .

— Quoi ?,- What ?,“What?”,‘What?’
"Le lendemain, Renée s’éveilla tard d’un sommeil lourd et sans rêves. Elle se fit faire un grand feu, elle dit qu’elle passerait la journée dans sa chambre. C’était là son refuge, aux heures graves. Vers midi, son mari ne la voyant pas descendre pour le déjeuner, lui demanda la permission de l’entretenir un instant. Elle refusait déjà avec une pointe d’inquiétude, lorsqu’elle se ravisa. La veille, elle avait remis à Saccard une note de Worms, montant à cent trente-six mille francs, un chiffre un peu gros, et sans doute il voulait se donner la galanterie de lui remettre lui-même la quittance.","The next day Renee awoke late from a heavy, dreamless sleep. She had a big fire made, she said she would spend the day in her room. This was his refuge, in serious hours. Around noon, her husband, not seeing her come down for lunch, asked her permission to talk to him for a moment. She was already refusing with a touch of worry, when she changed her mind. The day before she had given Saccard a note from Worms, amounting to one hundred and thirty-six thousand francs, a rather large figure, and no doubt he wanted to take the gallantry of giving her the receipt himself.","The next day, Renée woke late from a deep and dreamless sleep. She had a big fire laid in the fireplace and announced that she would spend the day in her room. That was her refuge in times of distress. Around noon, her husband, on learning that she would not be coming down for lunch, asked permission to speak to her for a moment. She was on the point of refusing, with a twinge of anxiety, when she thought better of it. The evening before she had given Saccard a bill from Worms in the amount of 136,000 francs, a rather large sum, and no doubt he hoped to please her by handing her the receipt in person.","The next morning Renée woke late from a deep sleep.

"Maxime ricanait ; il arrêta son père, le contempla au clair de lune, en déclarant qu’il avait « une bonne tête ». Mais Saccard se fit plus grave encore.","Maxime sneered; he stopped his father, gazed at him in the moonlight, declaring that he had “a good head”. But Saccard became even more serious.","Maxime snickered. He stopped his father, contemplated him in the moonlight, and told him he was “a good-looking fellow.” But Saccard went on, graver than before.","Maxime chuckled; he stopped his father, looked at him in the moonlight, and told him he was ‘a decent sort’. But Saccard became even more serious:"
"Elle garda ce drame pour elle seule, en doubla la souffrance par les fièvres de son imagination. Elle eût préféré mourir que d’avouer la vérité à Maxime. C’était une peur sourde que le jeune homme ne se révoltât, ne la quittât ; c’était surtout une croyance si absolue de péché monstrueux et de damnation éternelle, qu’elle aurait plus volontiers traversé nue le parc Monceau, que de confesser sa honte à voix basse. Elle restait, d’ailleurs, l’étourdie qui étonnait Paris par ses extravagances. Des gaietés nerveuses la prenaient, des caprices prodigieux, dont s’entretenaient les journaux, en la désignant par ses initiales. Ce fut à cette époque qu’elle voulut sérieusement se battre en duel, au pistolet, avec la duchesse de Sternich, qui avait, méchamment, disait-elle, renversé un verre de punch sur sa robe ; il fallut que son beau-frère le ministre se fâchât. Une autre fois, elle paria avec Mme de Lauwerens qu’elle ferait le tour de la piste de Longchamp en moins de dix minutes, et ce ne fut qu’une question de costume qui la retint. Maxime lui-même commençait à être effrayé par cette tête où la folie montait, et où il croyait entendre, la nuit, sur l’oreiller, tout le tapage d’une ville en rut de plaisirs.","She kept this drama for herself alone, doubling the suffering by the fevers of her imagination. She would have preferred to die than confess the truth to Maxime. It was a dull fear that the young man would revolt, would leave her; Above all, it was such an absolute belief in monstrous sin and eternal damnation that she would rather have walked naked through the Parc Monceau than confess her shame in a low voice. She remained, moreover, the scatterbrain who astonished Paris by her extravagances. Nervous gaiety seized her, prodigious caprices, of which the newspapers discussed, designating her by her initials. It was at this time that she seriously wanted to fight a duel, with a pistol, with the Duchesse de Sternich, who had, maliciously, she said, spilled a glass of punch on her dress; his brother-in-law the minister had to get angry. Another time, she bet with Madame de Lauwerens that she would lap the Longchamp runway in less than ten minutes, and it was only a question of costume that held her back. Maxime himself was beginning to be frightened by this head in which madness was mounting, and in which he thought he heard, at night, on the pillow, all the din of a city in a heat of pleasure.","She kept this drama to herself, her suffering redoubled by the fevers of her imagination. She would rather have died than confess the truth to Maxime. Inwardly she feared that the young man might rebel and leave her. Above all, she had such an absolute belief in the monstrousness of her sin and the prospect of eternal damnation that she would have crossed the Parc Monceau naked sooner than confess her shame in a whisper. Yet all the while she remained the madcap whose extravagance astonished Paris. She fell into the grip of a nervous gaiety, and the newspapers, designating her by her initials, spoke of her astounding caprices. It was during this period that she seriously proposed a duel, with pistols, with Duchess von Sternich, who she claimed had deliberately spilled a glass of punch on her dress. It took the ire of her brother-in-law the minister to put an end to this idea. On another occasion she bet Mme de Lauwerens that she could run a lap around Longchamp in less than ten minutes, and she would have done so had her costume allowed. Even Maxime began to be frightened by Renée’s increasingly insane behavior, and when he stared at her head on the pillow at night, it seemed to him filled with the crazed fury of a city bent on pleasure.","She kept her tragedy to herself. Her feverish imagination increased her anguish. She would rather have died than tell Maxime the truth. She was secretly afraid that he might suddenly leave her; above all, she had so absolute a belief in the monstrousness of her sin and the eternity of her damnation, that she would rather have crossed the Parc Monceau naked than have confessed her shame in a whisper. On the other hand, she still remained the scatterbrain who amazed Paris with her eccentricity. A nervous gaiety seized hold of her, and her mad whims were discussed in the newspapers with her name disguised by initials. It was at this time that she seriously wanted to fight a duel, with pistols, with the Duchesse de Sternich, who had deliberately, so she said, spilt a glass of punch over her dress; her brother-in-law, the minister, had to speak firmly to her before she abandoned the idea. On another occasion she bet Madame de Lauwerens that she would run round the track at Longchamps in less than ten minutes, and it was only a question of costume that deterred her. Maxime began to be frightened by these fits of seeming madness, in which he thought he could hear, at night, on the pillow, all the din of a city obsessed with the pursuit of pleasure."
"— Oh ! lui, répondit-elle, c’est un vilain homme. Jamais je n’aurais cru qu’un monsieur si distingué, si poli chez moi, parlât une telle langue. Mais je lui pardonne. Ce sont les femmes qui m’ont agacée. On aurait dit des marchandes de pommes. Il y en avait une qui se plaignait d’avoir un clou à la hanche, et, un peu plus, je crois qu’elle aurait relevé sa jupe pour faire voir son mal à tout le monde.","- Oh ! he, she answered, is a naughty man. I would never have believed that a gentleman so distinguished, so polite at home, spoke such a language. But I forgive him. It was the women who pissed me off. They looked like apple sellers. There was one who complained of having a nail in her hip, and, a little more, I think she would have lifted her skirt to make everyone see her pain.","she replied. “He’s a vile man. I never would have believed that a gentleman who is so distinguished and polite in my home could say such things. But I forgive him. It was the women who irritated me. They looked like the women you see selling apples. There was one who complained of a boil on her hip, and I think it wouldn’t have taken much for her to lift up her skirts and show us all her sore.”","He’s a nasty man. I couldn’t believe that a gentleman so distinguished, and so polite when he’s at my house, could have used such language. But I forgive him. It was the women that irritated me. You would have thought they were selling apples. There was one who complained of a boil on her hip, and I’m sure she wouldn’t have needed much encouragement to pull up her petticoat to show us.’"
"— Mais, c’est un remède, cette fille-là ! s’écria le jeune homme. Si j’avais le malheur de tomber jamais amoureux, tu me la prêterais, n’est-ce pas, pour qu’elle mît ses deux mains sur mon cœur ?","""But it's a remedy, that girl!"" cried the young man. If I had the misfortune to ever fall in love, you would lend her to me, wouldn't you, so that she could put her two hands on my heart?","“So she’s medicine!” the young man exclaimed. “If ever I suffer the misfortune of falling in love, you’ll lend her to me, won’t you? So that she can lay both of her hands on my heart?”","‘That girl can cure everything!’ cried Maxime. If ever I have the misfortune to fall in love, you’ll lend her to me, won’t you? To put her hands on my heart.’"
"Un silence terrible se fit. Lentement, Renée détacha ses bras du cou de Maxime ; et elle ne baissait pas le front, elle continuait à regarder son mari de ses grands yeux fixes de morte ; tandis que le jeune homme, écrasé, terrifié, chancelait, la tête basse, maintenant qu’il n’était plus soutenu par son étreinte. Saccard, foudroyé par ce coup suprême qui faisait enfin crier en lui l’époux et le père, n’avançait pas, livide, les brûlant de loin du feu de ses regards. Dans l’air moite et odorant de la pièce, les trois bougies flambaient très haut, la flamme droite, avec l’immobilité d’une larme ardente. Et, coupant seul le silence, le terrible silence, par l’étroit escalier un souffle de musique montait ; la valse, avec ses enroulements de couleuvre, se glissait, se nouait, s’endormait sur le tapis de neige, au milieu du maillot déchiré et des jupes tombées à terre.","A terrible silence ensued. Slowly, Renee untied her arms from Maxime's neck; and she did not lower her head, she continued to gaze at her husband with her great staring dead eyes; while the young man, crushed, terrified, staggered, his head bent, now that he was no longer supported by her embrace. Saccard, stunned by this supreme blow which finally made the husband and the father cry out within him, did not advance, livid, burning them from afar with the fire of his gaze. In the moist and fragrant air of the room, the three candles blazed very high, the flame erect, with the immobility of an ardent tear. And, alone breaking the silence, the terrible silence, up the narrow staircase a breath of music rose; the waltz, with its serpentine windings, slipped, knotted, fell asleep on the carpet of snow, in the midst of the torn jersey and the skirts that had fallen to the ground.","A terrible silence ensued. Slowly, Renée removed her arms from around Maxime’s neck. She did not lower her brow but continued to stare at her husband with big eyes as unblinking as the eyes of a corpse. Meanwhile, Maxime, his head bowed, looking stunned and terrified, wobbled unsteadily now that he was no longer supported by her embrace. Saccard, thunderstruck by this ultimate blow, which at last drew a cry of pain from the husband and father in him, turned white as a sheet and did not move, but the fire in his eyes singed them from afar. In the moist and pungent air of the dressing room, the three candles burned quite high, their flames steady and erect, like glowing tears. And the only thing that broke the silence—the terrible silence—was the faint music that floated up the narrow staircase. The waltz, with its serpentine undulations, slithered and coiled and came to rest on the snowy-white carpet, amid the torn tights and discarded petticoats.","There was a terrible silence. Slowly, Renée removed her arms from Maxime’s neck; she did not lower her head, but stared at her husband with wide, unblinking eyes like those of a corpse; the young man, dumbfounded and terrified, staggered forward now that he was no longer held in her embrace. Stunned by this final blow, which at last made the husband and father cry out in him, Saccard stood where he was, livid, his eyes burning into them from a distance. In the moist, fragrant atmosphere of the room, the three candles flared very high, their flames straight, with the immobility of fiery tears. The only thing that broke the terrible silence was a breath of music that floated up the narrow staircase: the waltz, with its serpentine modulations, glided, coiled, died away on the snow-white carpet, among the split tights and the skirts that had fallen on the floor."
"Maxime resta au collège de Plassans jusqu’aux vacances de 1854. Il avait treize ans et quelques mois, et venait d’achever sa cinquième. Ce fut alors que son père se décida à le faire venir à Paris. Il songeait qu’un fils de cet âge le poserait, l’installerait définitivement dans son rôle de veuf remarié, riche et sérieux.

"Élevée au logis, elle eût sans doute émoussé par la religion ou par quelque autre satisfaction nerveuse, les pointes des désirs dont les piqûres l’affolaient par instants.

"M. Toutin-Laroche, grand et maigre, ancien inventeur d’un mélange de suif et de stéarine pour la fabrication des bougies, rêvait le Sénat. Il s’était fait l’inséparable du baron Gouraud ; il se frottait à lui, avec l’idée vague que cela lui porterait bonheur. Au fond, il était très pratique, et s’il eût trouvé un fauteuil de sénateur à acheter, il en aurait âprement débattu le prix. L’empire allait mettre en vue cette nullité avide, ce cerveau étroit qui avait le génie des tripotages industriels. Il vendit le premier son nom à une compagnie véreuse, à une de ces sociétés qui poussèrent comme des champignons empoisonnés sur le fumier des spéculations impériales. On put voir collée aux murs, à cette époque, une affiche portant en grosses lettres noires ces mots : Société générale des ports du Maroc, et dans laquelle le nom de M. Toutin-Laroche, avec son titre de conseiller municipal, s’étalait, en tête de liste des membres du conseil de surveillance, tous plus inconnus les uns que les autres. Ce procédé, dont on a abusé depuis, fit merveille ; les actionnaires accoururent, bien que la question des ports du Maroc fût peu claire et que les braves gens qui apportaient leur argent ne pussent expliquer eux-mêmes à quelle œuvre on allait l’employer. L’affiche parlait superbement d’établir des stations commerciales le long de la Méditerranée. Depuis deux ans, certains journaux célébraient cette opération grandiose, qu’ils déclaraient plus prospère tous les trois mois. Au conseil municipal, M. Toutin-Laroche passait pour un administrateur de premier mérite ; il était une des fortes têtes de l’endroit, et sa tyrannie aigre sur ses collègues n’avait d’égale que sa platitude dévote devant le préfet. Il travaillait déjà à la création d’une grande compagnie financière, le Crédit viticole, une caisse de prêt pour les vignerons, dont il parlait avec des réticences, des attitudes graves qui allumaient autour de lui les convoitises des imbéciles.","Mr. Toutin-Laroche, tall and thin, former inventor of a mixture of tallow and stearin for the manufacture of candles, dreamed of the Senate. He had become inseparable from Baron Gouraud; he rubbed shoulders with him, with the vague idea that it would bring him happiness. Basically, he was very practical, and if he had found a senator's chair to buy, he would have debated the price fiercely. The empire was going to bring into view this greedy nonentity, this narrow brain which had the genius for industrial fiddling. He was the first to sell his name to a crooked company, to one of those companies which grew like poisonous mushrooms on the manure of imperial speculation. One could see glued to the walls, at that time, a poster bearing in large black letters these words: General Society of the Ports of Morocco, and in which the name of Mr. Toutin-Laroche, with his title of municipal councillor, was displayed. , at the top of the list of members of the supervisory board, each more unknown than the other. This process, which has since been abused, worked wonders; the shareholders came running, although the question of the ports of Morocco was not very clear and that the good people who brought their money could not explain themselves to what work it was going to be used. The poster spoke superbly of establishing trading stations along the Mediterranean. For two years, some newspapers celebrated this grandiose operation, which they declared more prosperous every three months. On the municipal council, M. Toutin-Laroche passed for an administrator of the first merit; he was one of the strongest minds in the place, and his sour tyranny over his colleagues was equaled only by his devout platitude before the prefect. He was already working on the creation of a large financial company, the Crédit viticole, a loan fund for winegrowers, of which he spoke with reluctance, serious attitudes which kindled the covetousness of imbeciles around him.","M. Toutin-Laroche, a tall, thin man known for having invented a mixture of suet and stearin used in the manufacture of candles, dreamed of becoming a senator. He stuck to Baron Gouraud like a leech, rubbing up against him with the idea that this would somehow bring him luck. At bottom he was a very pragmatic man, and had he found a senate seat for sale he would have haggled ferociously over the price. The Empire was about to make a celebrity of this greedy nonentity, this narrow-minded entrepreneur with a genius for shady industrial deals. He was the first to sell his name to a dubious company, one of those corporations that sprang up like poisonous mushrooms on the dung heap of imperial speculation. Some time ago a poster could be seen glued to the walls of Paris and bearing the following words in big black letters: SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE DES PORTS DU MAROC. It featured the name of M. Toutin-Laroche together with his title as municipal councilor at the head of a list of members of the board of directors, each more obscure than the next so far as the general public was concerned. This technique, much abused since, worked wonders. People rushed to buy stock in the company, even though a great deal remained unclear about what was to be done with the “ports of Morocco,” and the good people who invested their money could not themselves explain what project it was to be used for. The poster offered a superb description of commercial stations to be established along the Mediterranean coast. For two years previously, certain newspapers had been singing the praises of this ambitious venture, which every three months they reported to be prospering as never before. At the municipal council, M. Toutin-Laroche enjoyed a reputation as a top-flight administrator. He was one of the big thinkers of the group, and the harsh tyranny he exercised over his colleagues was rivaled only by the abject devotion he showed to the prefect. He was already at work setting up a major financial venture to be called the Crédit Viticole, which proposed to lend money to wine growers, and he spoke of this in such a halting, grave manner that all the imbeciles around him burned to invest in it.","Monsieur Toutin-Laroche, tall and thin, had invented a mixture of tallow and stearine for the manufacture of candles, and longed to enter the Senate. He clung to Baron Gouraud like a leech, rubbing up against him with the vague idea that it would bring him luck. At bottom he was exceedingly practical; and had he come across a senator’s seat for sale, he would have haggled fiercely over the price. The Empire was to bring into prominence this greedy nonentity, this simpleton with a talent for industrial swindles. He was the first to sell his name to a shady company, one of those companies that sprouted like poisonous toadstools on the dunghill of Imperial speculation. At that time one could see on walls a poster bearing these words in big black letters: Société Générale of the Ports of Morocco, on which the name of Monsieur Toutin-Laroche, with his title as municipal councillor, was displayed at the head of the list of members of the board of directors, all of whom were totally unknown. This method, which has since been abused, succeeded admirably: the shares were snapped up, though the question of the Ports of Morocco was not at all clear, and the worthy people who brought their money were quite unable to explain the use to which it would be put. The poster spoke grandiloquently of trading posts to be established along the Mediterranean. For two years several newspapers had been celebrating this project, which they declared to be gaining in prosperity every quarter. In the City Council Monsieur Toutin-Laroche was considered a first-rate administrator; he was one of the leading lights of the place, and his tyranny over his colleagues was matched only by his self-effacement in the presence of the Prefect. He was now engaged in the creation of a great finance company, the Crédit Viticole, a wine-growers’ loan office, to which he referred with a reticence and an air of solemnity that kindled the covetousness of the idiots around him."
"Alors ils s’arrêtèrent un instant, face à face, rapprochant leurs visages. Quand le cigare fut allumé :","So they stopped for a moment, face to face, bringing their faces together. When the cigar was lit:","They stopped for a moment, face-to-face, and brought their heads together. When the cigar was lit, Saccard took his son’s arm, squeezed it tightly under his own, and continued with what he had been saying: “You know, you’re an imbecile if you don’t listen to me.","Then they stopped for a moment, facing each other. When the cigar was alight the father continued, once more taking his son’s arm, pressing it tightly under his own:"
"Le jeune homme, qui venait de jeter son cigare, rentra dans le grand salon. Il était venu beaucoup de monde. La galerie était pleine d’habits noirs, debout, causant à demi-voix, et de jupes, étalées largement le long des causeuses. Des laquais commençaient à promener des plats d’argent, chargés de glaces et de verres de punch.","The young man, who had just thrown away his cigar, re-entered the large drawing-room. Many people had come. The gallery was full of black coats, standing, talking in an undertone, and skirts, spread wide along the loveseats. Lackeys were beginning to carry around silver platters laden with ice-creams and glasses of punch.","The young man disposed of his cigar and returned to the drawing room. Lots of people had gathered.

"Mais elle resta sombre, et Maxime, voyant qu’elle se taisait toujours, crut qu’elle ne l’écoutait pas. La nuque appuyée contre le bord capitonné de la calèche, elle semblait dormir les yeux ouverts. Elle songeait, inerte, livrée aux rêves qui la tenaient ainsi affaissée, et, par moments, de légers battements nerveux agitaient ses lèvres. Elle était mollement envahie par l’ombre du crépuscule ; tout ce que cette ombre contenait d’indécise tristesse, de discrète volupté, d’espoir inavoué, la pénétrait, la baignait dans une sorte d’air alangui et morbide. Sans doute, tandis qu’elle regardait fixement le dos rond du valet de pied assis sur le siège, elle pensait à ces joies de la veille, à ces fêtes qu’elle trouvait si fades, dont elle ne voulait plus ; elle voyait sa vie passée, le contentement immédiat de ses appétits, l’écœurement du luxe, la monotonie écrasante des mêmes tendresses et des mêmes trahisons. Puis, comme une espérance, se levait en elle, avec des frissons de désir, l’idée de cet « autre chose » que son esprit tendu ne pouvait trouver. Là, sa rêverie s’égarait. Elle faisait un effort, mais toujours le mot cherché se dérobait dans la nuit tombante, se perdait dans le roulement continu des voitures. Le bercement souple de la calèche était une hésitation de plus qui l’empêchait de formuler son envie. Et une tentation immense montait de ce vague, de ces taillis que l’ombre endormait aux deux bords de l’allée, de ce bruit de roues et de cette oscillation molle qui l’emplissait d’une torpeur délicieuse. Mille petits souffles lui passaient sur la chair : songeries inachevées, voluptés innommées, souhaits confus, tout ce qu’un retour du Bois, à l’heure où le ciel pâlit, peut mettre d’exquis et de monstrueux dans le cœur lassé d’une femme. Elle tenait ses deux mains enfouies dans la peau d’ours, elle avait très chaud sous son paletot de drap blanc, aux revers de velours mauve. Comme elle allongeait un pied, pour se détendre dans son bien-être, elle frôla de sa cheville la jambe tiède de Maxime, qui ne prit même pas garde à cet attouchement. Une secousse la tira de son demi-sommeil. Elle leva la tête, regardant étrangement de ses yeux gris le jeune homme vautré en toute élégance.","But she remained gloomy, and Maxime, seeing that she was still silent, thought she was not listening to him. Her neck leaning against the padded edge of the carriage, she seemed to be asleep with her eyes open. She was thinking, inert, given over to the dreams that kept her so slumped, and, at times, slight nervous throbs moved her lips. She was softly invaded by the shadow of twilight; all that this shadow contained of indecisive sadness, of discreet voluptuousness, of unacknowledged hope, penetrated her, bathed her in a kind of languid and morbid air. No doubt, while she gazed fixedly at the round back of the footman seated on the chair, she thought of those joys of the day before, of those parties which she found so insipid, which she no longer wanted; she saw her past life, the immediate satisfaction of her appetites, the disgust of luxury, the crushing monotony of the same tenderness and the same betrayal. Then, like a hope, rose in her, with shivers of desire, the idea of this ""something else"" that her tense mind could not find. There, his reverie wandered off. She made an effort, but the word she was looking for always slipped away in the falling night, lost in the continuous rolling of cars. The supple rocking of the carriage was one more hesitation that prevented him from formulating his desire. And an immense temptation arose from this vagueness, from these copses which the shade slept at the two edges of the path, from this noise of wheels and this soft oscillation which filled it with a delicious torpor. A thousand little breaths passed over her flesh: unfinished dreams, nameless pleasures, confused wishes, all that a return from the Bois, at a time when the sky is turning pale, can bring exquisiteness and monstrousness to the heart weary of a woman. She had both her hands buried in the bearskin, she was very warm under her overcoat of white cloth with mauve velvet lapels. As she stretched out one foot, to relax in her well-being, her ankle brushed the warm leg of Maxime, who did not even notice this touching. A jolt roused her from her half-sleep. She lifted her head, looking strangely with her gray eyes at the elegantly sprawling young man.","She remained somber, however, and Maxime, seeing that she stayed silent, concluded that she wasn’t listening. With the back of her neck resting on the padded sill of the carriage, she seemed to be asleep with her eyes wide open. She lay inert, in the grip of her dreams, while now and then her lips twitched nervously. The shadow of twilight softly invaded her. All that that shadow contained of vague sadness, of discreet pleasure, of unavowed hope, penetrated her, bathing her in a sort of languid and morbid atmosphere. While staring at the round back of the footman perched on his bench, she was no doubt thinking about her pleasures of the past, of the parties she now found so dreary and no longer cared for. She looked back on her former life: the immediate gratification of her appetites, the loathsome luxury, and the oppressive monotony of the same caresses and the same betrayals repeated time and time again. Then there dawned in her something like a ray of hope, along with shudders of desire: the idea of that “something else” that her feverish mind had failed to discover. At this point her reverie went awry. Despite her efforts, the word she was looking for eluded her in the gathering darkness, was swallowed up by the steady rumble of the carriages. The soft swaying of the calèche was yet another obstacle that prevented her from formulating what it was she wanted. A tremendous temptation welled up from all that emptiness, from the shrubbery slumbering in the darkness on either side of the path, from the sound of the wheels and the gentle rocking of the carriage, which filled her with a delicious drowsiness. A thousand tiny breaths blew across her flesh: unfinished dreams, unnamed pleasures, vague wants—all the exquisite and monstrous things that a drive home from the Bois at the hour when the sky turns pale can put into a woman’s weary heart. She kept her two hands buried in the bearskin and felt very warm in her white cloth jacket with its mauve velvet lining. As she stretched her leg, relaxing in snug comfort, her ankle brushed the warmth of Maxime’s leg. He took no particular notice of this touch. A jolt wrenched her from her half-sleep. Lifting her head, she turned her gray eyes on the young man sprawled in all his elegance and stared at him oddly.","She did not react, and Maxime concluded that she was not listening. She seemed to be sleeping with her eyes open, the nape of her neck resting against the padded edge of the barouche. She lay listlessly, thinking, prey to the dreams that kept her in a sombre mood, and from time to time a slight nervous tremor passed over her lips. She was slowly overcome by the shadow of the twilight; all that this shadow contained of sadness, of discreet pleasures and secret hopes, penetrated her, enveloping her with an air of morbid languor. Doubtless, while staring at the round back of the footman on his box, she was thinking of those fleeting delights, of those entertainments that had faded so quickly, and of which she was now so weary; she pictured her past life, the instantaneous satisfaction of her appetites, the sickening luxury, the appalling monotony of the same loves and the same betrayals. Then, like a ray of hope, there came to her, with shivers of longing, the idea of that ‘something different’ that her conscious mind could hardly grasp. Her dreams wandered. The word she strove to find escaped into the night, became lost in the movement of the carriages. The gentle vibration of the barouche was but one more impediment to the formulation of her desire. An immense temptation rose from the empty space, from the copses asleep in the shadows on either side of the avenue, from the noise of wheels and from the gentle oscillation that made her so pleasantly drowsy. A thousand tremulous emotions passed over her body: unrealized dreams, nameless delights, confused longings, all the monstrous voluptuousness that a drive home from the Bois under a paling sky can infuse into a woman’s heart. She kept both hands buried in the bearskin, she was quite warm in her white cloth coat with the mauve velvet lapels. She put out her foot, stretching, and her ankle lightly touched Maxime’s warm leg; he took no notice. A jolt aroused her from her torpor. She raised her head, and her grey eyes looked curiously at the young man who sat lounging in an attitude of sheer elegance."

"Le grand salon de l’hôtel était une vaste pièce longue, une sorte de galerie, allant d’un pavillon à l’autre, occupant toute la façade du côté du jardin. Une large porte-fenêtre s’ouvrait sur le perron. Cette galerie était resplendissante d’or. Le plafond, légèrement cintré, avait des enroulements capricieux courant autour de grands médaillons dorés, qui luisaient comme des boucliers. Des rosaces, des guirlandes éclatantes bordaient la voûte ; des filets, pareils à des jets de métal en fusion, coulaient sur les murs, encadrant les panneaux, tendus de soie rouge ; des tresses de roses, avec des gerbes épanouies au sommet, retombaient le long des glaces. Sur le parquet, un tapis d’Aubusson étalait ses fleurs de pourpre. Le meuble de damas de soie rouge, les portières et les rideaux de même étoffe, l’énorme pendule rocaille de la cheminée, les vases de Chine posés sur les consoles, les pieds des deux tables longues ornées de mosaïques de Florence, jusqu’aux jardinières placées dans les embrasures des fenêtres, suaient l’or, égouttaient l’or. Aux quatre angles se dressaient quatre grandes lampes posées sur des socles de marbre rouge, auxquels les attachaient des chaînes de bronze doré, tombant avec des grâces symétriques. Et, du plafond, descendaient trois lustres à pendeloques de cristal, ruisselants de gouttes de lumière bleues et roses, et dont les clartés ardentes faisaient flamber tout l’or du salon.","The large hall of the hotel was a vast long room, a sort of gallery, going from one pavilion to another, occupying the whole facade on the side of the garden. A large French window opened onto the porch. This gallery was resplendent with gold. The slightly arched ceiling had capricious windings running around large golden medallions, which gleamed like shields. Rosettes and dazzling garlands bordered the vault; nets, like jets of molten metal, ran down the walls, framing the panels, stretched with red silk; braids of roses, with blooming sheaves at the top, fell along the mirrors. On the floor, an Aubusson rug spread its purple flowers. The furniture in red silk damask, the doors and curtains of the same fabric, the enormous rocaille clock in the fireplace, the Chinese vases placed on the consoles, the legs of the two long tables decorated with mosaics from Florence, even the planters placed in the embrasures of the windows, sweating gold, dripping gold. At the four corners stood four large lamps placed on red marble pedestals, to which they were attached chains of gilded bronze, falling with symmetrical graces. And from the ceiling descended three chandeliers with crystal pendants, dripping with drops of blue and pink light, and whose ardent gleams set all the gold in the drawing-room on fire.","The main salon was a long vast room, a sort of gallery extending from one pavilion to the other and occupying the entire façade on the garden side.

Sprays of gold, like jets of molten metal, ran along the walls, framing the panels, which were covered with red silk. Plaited stems topped by bouquets of rose blossoms hung beside mirrors. An Aubusson carpet covering the parquet showed off its purple flowers. The damasked red silk upholstery, door curtains, and drapes; the enormous rockwork clock on the fireplace; the Chinese vases on their consoles; the feet of the two long tables embellished with Florentine mosaics; and even the jardinières in the embrasures next to the windows—all of these things sweated and dripped with gold. In the four corners of the room, four large lamps stood on pedestals of red marble from which chains of gilded bronze were draped with symmetrical grace. And from the ceiling hung three crystal chandeliers, shedding droplets of blue and pink light whose ardent glow set all the gold in the salon ablaze.","The drawing room was long and vast, a sort of gallery that ran from one pavilion to the other, taking up the whole of the façade on the garden side.

Roses and dazzling garlands encircled the arch; fillets of gold, like threads of molten metal, ran round the walls, framing the panels, which were hung with red silk; festoons of roses, topped with tufts of full-blown blossoms, hung down along the sides of the mirrors. An Aubusson carpet spread its purple flowers over the polished floor.

"Cette porte était typique, avec les bornes qui la flanquaient, renversées à demi et largement cerclées de fer. On voyait qu’anciennement on avait ménagé le lit d’un ruisseau, au milieu de la porte, entre les pentes légères du cailloutage du porche ; mais M. Béraud s’était décidé à boucher ce ruisseau en faisant bitumer l’entrée ; ce fut, d’ailleurs, le seul sacrifice aux architectes modernes qu’il accepta jamais. Les fenêtres des étages étaient garnies de minces rampes de fer forgé, laissant voir leurs croisées colossales à fortes boiseries brunes et à petits carreaux verdâtres.","This gate was typical, with the bollards which flanked it, half reversed and largely ringed with iron. You could see that formerly they had made the bed of a stream, in the middle of the door, between the slight slopes of the stonework of the porch; but M.

The windows on the floors were lined with slender railings of wrought iron, revealing their colossal casements with heavy brown woodwork and small greenish panes.","It was the classic carriage entrance, flanked by off-kilter hitching posts circled by iron hoops. One could see that a gutter had once run through the center of the gate and that the ballast beneath the porch had been gently sloped to channel water into it from either side. M. Béraud had decided, however, to pave the entrance and block this gutter. This was the only sacrifice to modern architecture to which he ever agreed. The windows on the upper floors were enclosed by thin iron handrails through which the colossal casements, with their heavy brown sashes and small greenish panes, could be seen.","This characteristic entrance was flanked on either side with spur-posts sloping backwards, and strapped with broad iron bands. One could see that formerly a gutter had run under the middle of the gateway, between the weatherings of the pebble-work of the porch; but Monsieur Béraud had decided to stop up this gutter and have the entrance asphalted: this, however, was the only concession he could ever be persuaded to make to modern architecture.

"Cette première entrevue fut suivie d’une visite officielle que la tante Élisabeth fit à Aristide Saccard, à son appartement de la rue Payenne. Cette fois, elle venait au nom de M. Béraud. L’ancien magistrat avait refusé de voir « cet homme », comme il appelait le séducteur de sa fille, tant qu’il ne serait pas marié avec Renée, à laquelle il avait d’ailleurs également défendu sa porte. Mme Aubertot avait de pleins pouvoirs pour traiter. Elle parut heureuse du luxe de l’employé ; elle avait craint que le frère de cette Mme Sidonie, aux jupes fripées, ne fût un goujat. Il la reçut, drapé dans une délicieuse robe de chambre. C’était l’heure où les aventuriers du 2 Décembre, après avoir payé leurs dettes, jetaient dans les égouts leurs bottes éculées, leurs redingotes blanchies aux coutures, rasaient leur barbe de huit jours, et devenaient des hommes comme il faut. Saccard entrait enfin dans la bande, il se nettoyait les ongles et ne se lavait plus qu’avec des poudres et des parfums inestimables. Il fut galant ; il changea de tactique, se montra d’un désintéressement prodigieux. Quand la vieille dame parla du contrat, il fit un geste, comme pour dire que peu lui importait. Depuis huit jours, il feuilletait le Code, il méditait sur cette grave question, dont dépendait dans l’avenir sa liberté de tripoteur d’affaires.","This first interview was followed by an official visit that Aunt Élisabeth made to Aristide Saccard, at his apartment in the rue Payenne. This time she came in the name of M. Béraud. The former magistrate had refused to see ""this man"", as he called his daughter's seducer, until he was married to Renée, to whom he had also defended his door. Madame Aubertot had full powers to treat. She seemed happy with the clerk's luxury; she had feared that the brother of this Madame Sidonie, with the wrinkled skirts, was a boor. He received her, draped in a delicious dressing gown. It was the hour when the adventurers of the 2nd of December, after having paid their debts, threw their worn-out boots into the sewers, their frock coats whitened at the seams, shaved off their eight-day beards, and became decent men. Saccard finally entered the band, he cleaned his nails and only washed with priceless powders and perfumes. He was gallant; he changed his tactics, showed a prodigious disinterestedness. When the old lady mentioned the contract, he gestured, as if to say that he didn't care. For the past eight days he had been leafing through the Code, pondering this grave question, on which depended his future freedom as a business hoarder.","This first interview was followed by an official visit: Aunt Elisabeth called on Aristide Saccard in his apartment on the rue Payenne, this time on behalf of M. Béraud. The former magistrate had refused to see “that man,” as he referred to his daughter’s seducer, so long as he was not married to Renée, whom he had also banished from his home. Mme Aubertot had full powers to make all the arrangements. She seemed pleased to find the clerk ensconced in such luxurious surroundings, having been afraid that the brother of the rather bedraggled-looking Mme Sidonie might turn out to be a man of no refinement. He greeted her in a sumptuous dressing gown. These were the days when the adventurers who had swept to power in the wake of the December coup, having paid off their debts, flung their worn boots and frayed waistcoats into the sewers, shaved the week’s growth from their faces, and became proper gentlemen. Saccard had at last joined the gang. He now cleaned his nails and daubed himself with priceless powders and perfumes after his bath. He was stylish, and he changed tactics, affecting a prodigious lack of interest in the entire affair. When the old woman brought up the contract, he made a gesture as if to say that the whole thing was of no importance to him. For the past week he had been studying the Code14 and pondering a grave question on which his future freedom to wheel and deal would depend.","This first interview was followed by an official visit which Aunt Élisabeth paid Saccard at his rooms in the Rue Payenne.

Madame Aubertot had full powers of treaty. She seemed pleased with the clerk’s luxurious abode; she had feared that the brother of Madame Sidonie, with her frayed skirts, might be a boorish person. He received her swathed in a splendid dressing gown. It was at the time when the adventurers of 2 December, after paying their debts, flung their worn boots and dirty coats into the sewers, shaved their week-old beards, and became respectable.

"Ces dames n’en dormaient plus. Certaines d’entre elles changeaient jusqu’à trois fois de costume. Il y eut des conférences interminables que le préfet présidait. On discuta longuement d’abord le personnage de Narcisse. Serait-ce une femme ou un homme qui le représenterait ? Enfin, sur les instances de Renée, il fut décidé que l’on confierait le rôle à Maxime ; mais il serait le seul homme, et encore Mme de Lauwerens disait-elle qu’elle ne consentirait jamais à cela, si « le petit Maxime ne ressemblait pas à une vraie fille ». Renée devait être la nymphe Écho. La question des costumes fut beaucoup plus laborieuse. Maxime donna un bon coup de main au préfet, qui se trouvait sur les dents, au milieu de neuf femmes, dont l’imagination folle menaçait de compromettre gravement la pureté des lignes de son œuvre. S’il les avait écoutées, son Olympe aurait porté de la poudre. Mme d’Espanet voulait absolument avoir une robe à traîne pour cacher ses pieds un peu forts, tandis que Mme Haffner rêvait de s’habiller avec une peau de bête. M. Hupel de la Noue fut énergique ; il se fâcha même une fois ; il était convaincu, il disait que s’il avait renoncé aux vers, c’était pour écrire son poème « avec des étoffes savamment combinées et des attitudes choisies parmi les plus belles ».","These ladies couldn't sleep any longer. Some of them changed costumes up to three times. There were endless conferences over which the prefect presided. We first discussed the character of Narcissus at length. Would it be a woman or a man who would represent him? Finally, at Renée's insistence, it was decided that the role would be given to Maxime; but he would be the only man, and even Madame de Lauwerens said she would never consent to that if ""little Maxime did not look like a real girl."" Renee must have been the Echo nymph. The question of costumes was much more laborious. Maxime gave a good helping hand to the prefect, who found himself on edge, in the midst of nine women, whose wild imaginations threatened to seriously compromise the purity of the lines of his work. If he had listened to them, his Olympus would have worn gunpowder. Madame d'Espanet absolutely wanted to have a dress with a train to hide her somewhat large feet, while Madame Haffner dreamed of dressing in animal skin. M. Hupel de la Noue was energetic; he even got angry once; he was convinced, he said that if he had given up verse, it was to write his poem “with skilfully combined fabrics and attitudes chosen from among the most beautiful”.","The ladies had no rest.

Madame d’Espanet insisted on having a train cut on her dress to hide her feet, which were a trifle large, while Madame Haffner had visions of herself clad in some sort of animal skin.

"M. Michelin souriait. Il emmena sa femme avec précaution, comme s’il eût tenu au bras un objet fragile et précieux.

"Ils plaisantèrent, ils firent au Bois leur promenade accoutumée. Quinze jours se passèrent.

On eût dit seulement qu’elle avait fait quelque chute secrète, dont elle ne parlait pas, mais qu’elle confessait par un mépris plus marqué pour elle-même et par une dépravation plus risquée dans ses caprices de grande mondaine.

Cet aveu surprit et embarrassa le jeune homme lui-même, qui n’avait pourtant pas de grands scrupules. Il voulut catéchiser sa belle-mère : vraiment, ce n’était pas là sa place ; elle n’y verrait, d’ailleurs, rien de bien drôle ; puis, si elle était reconnue, cela ferait scandale.

"Quand Saccard, après avoir arrêté son plan, se mit en quête des premiers fonds, il songea naturellement à sa sœur. Elle secoua la tête, soupira en parlant des trois milliards. Mais l’employé ne lui tolérait pas sa folie, il la secouait rudement chaque fois qu’elle revenait à la dette des Stuarts ; ce rêve lui semblait déshonorer une intelligence si pratique. Mme Sidonie, qui essuyait tranquillement les ironies les plus dures sans que ses convictions fussent ébranlées, lui expliqua ensuite avec une grande lucidité qu’il ne trouverait pas un sou, n’ayant à offrir aucune garantie. Cette conversation avait lieu devant la Bourse, où elle devait jouer ses économies. Vers trois heures, on était certain de la trouver appuyée contre la grille, à gauche, du côté du bureau de poste ; c’était là qu’elle donnait audience à des individus louches et vagues comme elle. Son frère allait la quitter, lorsqu’elle murmura d’un ton désolé : « Ah ! si tu n’étais pas marié !… » Cette réticence, dont il ne voulut pas demander le sens complet et exact, rendit Saccard singulièrement rêveur.","When Saccard, after drawing up his plan, went in search of the first funds, he naturally thought of his sister. She shook her head, sighed, talking about the three billion. But the clerk would not tolerate her madness, he shook her roughly every time she returned to the Stuarts' debt; this dream seemed to him to dishonor such a practical intelligence. Mme Sidonie, who quietly suffered the harshest ironies without her convictions being shaken, then explained to him with great lucidity that he would not find a penny, having to offer no guarantee. This conversation took place in front of the Stock Exchange, where she was to stake her savings. Around three o'clock, we were sure to find her leaning against the gate, on the left, near the post office; it was there that she gave audience to shady and vague individuals like herself. Her brother was about to leave her when she murmured in a sorry tone: “Ah! if you weren't married!..."" This reluctance, the full and exact meaning of which he did not want to ask, made Saccard singularly pensive.","When Saccard, having settled on a plan, set out in search of seed money, he naturally thought of his sister. She shook her head and sighed with an allusion to the three billion francs. But the clerk had no patience with her folly and cut her short whenever she brought up the matter of the Stuart debt. Daydreams of that sort in so practical a mind struck him as disgraceful. Mme Sidonie, whose convictions were impervious to the harshest sarcasms, went on to explain in the clearest of terms that since he had no collateral to offer, he would find it impossible to borrow a cent. This conversation took place in front of the Bourse,7 where she no doubt gambled with her savings. At around three o’clock you could be sure of finding her leaning against the railing on the left, on the side facing the post office, where she held court for characters as suspect and dubious as herself. Her brother was about to take his leave when she murmured wistfully, “ Ah, if only you weren’t married.” This reticence, the full and precise meaning of which he did not wish to inquire into, put Saccard in an unusually reflective frame of mind.","When Saccard, having drawn up his schemes, set out in search of his initial capital, he naturally thought of his sister. She shook her head, sighed, and talked of her three thousand million. But the clerk would not humour her madness, he pulled her up roughly each time she got back to the Stuart debt; this myth seemed to him to do little credit to so practical an intellect. Madame Sidonie, who quietly accepted the most cutting comment without allowing her convictions to be shaken, explained to him very clearly that he would not raise a sou, as he had no security to offer. This conversation took place in front of the Bourse, where she was about to speculate with her savings. She could always be found at about three o’clock leaning against the rail, on the left, on the post-office side; it was there that she gave audience to individuals as shady and sinister as herself. As her brother was about to take leave of her, she murmured regretfully, ‘Ah! If only you weren’t married!’ This remark, of which he did not wish to ask the precise meaning, plunged Saccard into deep thought."

"Ces messieurs, avec leurs bottes bien cirées, leurs redingotes et leurs chapeaux de haute forme, mettaient une singulière note dans ce paysage boueux, d’un jaune sale, où ne passaient que des ouvriers blêmes, des chevaux crottés jusqu’à l’échine, des chariots dont le bois disparaissait sous une croûte de poussière. Ils se suivaient à la file, sautaient de pierre en pierre, évitant les mares de fange coulante, parfois enfonçaient jusqu’aux chevilles et juraient alors en secouant les pieds. Saccard avait parlé d’aller prendre la rue de Charonne, ce qui leur aurait évité cette promenade dans ces terres défoncées ; mais ils avaient malheureusement plusieurs immeubles à visiter sur la longue ligne du boulevard ; la curiosité les poussant, ils s’étaient décidés à passer au beau milieu des travaux. D’ailleurs, ça les intéressait beaucoup. Ils s’arrêtaient parfois en équilibre sur un plâtras roulé au fond d’une ornière, levaient le nez, s’appelaient pour se montrer un plancher béant, un tuyau de cheminée resté en l’air, une solive tombée sur un toit voisin. Ce coin de ville détruite, au sortir de la rue du Temple, leur semblait tout à fait drôle.","These gentlemen, with their well-polished boots, their frock coats and their tall hats, set a singular note in this muddy landscape, of a dirty yellow, where only pale workmen passed, horses muddy to the spine. , wagons whose wood disappeared under a crust of dust. They followed each other in file, jumping from stone to stone, avoiding pools of flowing mire, sometimes sinking to their ankles and then swearing, shaking their feet. Saccard had spoken of going to take the rue de Charonne, which would have spared them this walk in these broken lands; but unfortunately they had several buildings to visit on the long line of the boulevard; Curiosity pushing them, they had decided to pass in the middle of the work. Besides, they were very interested. Sometimes they stopped in balance on a rolled plaster at the bottom of a rut, raised their noses, called to each other to show themselves a gaping floor, a chimney pipe remained in the air, a joist fallen on a neighboring roof. This corner of the destroyed town, on leaving the Rue du Temple, seemed to them quite funny.","The visiting gentlemen, with their carefully polished boots, frock coats, and top hats, injected a singular note into this muddy landscape of brown filth in which the only things that moved were sallow workmen, horses spattered with mud all the way up their flanks, and wagons whose sides were completely coated with dust. They walked single file, jumping from stone to stone while mostly avoiding pools of liquid filth, but occasionally sinking in up to their ankles, which made them swear out loud and shake their feet. Saccard had suggested taking the rue de Charonne, which would have made it unnecessary to traverse this area of excavation, but unfortunately the committee had a number of buildings to visit up and down the lengthy boulevard. Driven by curiosity, they had decided to set a course right through the heart of the construction. In any case, it interested them greatly. At times one of them would stop and balance himself on a chunk of plaster lying in a rut, look up, and call the attention of the others to a gaping floor, a piece of flue pipe hanging in the air, or a beam that had fallen onto a neighboring roof. This razed section of city at the end of the rue du Temple actually struck them as quite funny.","The gentlemen, with their polished boots, their frock coats, and top hats, struck a strange note in this muddy, dirty yellow landscape, traversed only by sallow workmen, horses splashed to their backs, carts whose sides were hidden beneath a coating of dust. They went in single file, hopping from stone to stone, avoiding the pools of liquid mire, sometimes sinking in up to their ankles and then cursing as they shook their feet. Saccard had suggested taking the Rue de Charonne, which would have spared them this tramp over rough ground; but unfortunately they had several plots to visit on the long line of the boulevard; they had decided, out of curiosity, to go through the middle of the roadworks. From time to time they stopped, balancing on a piece of plaster that had fallen into a rut, calling to one another to point out some yawning flooring, a flue stuck straight up in the air, a joist that had fallen onto a neighbouring roof. This demolition area at the end of the Rue du Temple fascinated them."

"Maintenant, ils parlaient des ouvriers, en reprenant leur marche prudente au milieu des flaques. Il n’y en avait pas beaucoup de bons. C’étaient tous des fainéants, des mange-tout, et entêtés avec cela, ne rêvant que la ruine des patrons. M. de Mareuil, qui, depuis un instant, regardait avec un frisson deux pauvres diables perchés au coin d’un toit, attaquant une muraille à coups de pioche, émit cette idée que ces hommes-là avaient pourtant un fier courage. Les autres s’arrêtèrent de nouveau, levèrent les yeux vers les démolisseurs en équilibre, courbés, tapant à toute volée ; ils poussaient les pierres du pied et les regardaient tranquillement s’écraser en bas ; si leur pioche avait porté à faux, le seul élan de leurs bras les aurait précipités.","Now they were talking about the workers, resuming their cautious walk in the middle of the puddles. There weren't many good ones. They were all lazy, snappers, and stubborn about it, dreaming only of the ruin of the bosses. M. de Mareuil, who for a moment had been gazing with a shudder at two poor devils perched on the corner of a roof, attacking a wall with blows of a pickaxe, suggested that these men had nevertheless a proud courage. The others stopped again, looked up at the wreckers poised, bent, stomping; they kicked the stones with their feet and quietly watched them crash down below; if their pickaxe had gone off course, the sheer swing of their arms would have precipitated them.","Now, as the men went back to picking their way among the puddles, the conversation turned to workers. There weren’t many good ones. They were all lazy, wasteful, and pigheaded and dreamed of nothing but their employers’ ruin. M. de Mareuil, who for the past minute had been nervously watching two poor devils perched on the corner of a roof as they attacked a wall with pickaxes, nevertheless voiced the thought that fellows like those displayed splendid courage. The others stopped once more and looked up at the demolition workers balanced on the edge of the roof as they bent their backs and swung their axes with all their might. The workmen kicked stones from the wall with their feet and watched calmly as they crashed to the ground.","They talked about the workmen as they resumed their cautious progress through the puddles. There were not many good ones among them. They were all lazy, spendthrift, and obstinate into the bargain, dreaming only of their employer’s ruin. Monsieur de Mareuil, who for the last minute had been nervously watching two poor devils perched on the corner of a roof hacking at a wall with their pickaxes, expressed the view that they were very courageous all the same. The others stopped again and looked up at the labourers balancing themselves, leaning over, striking with all their might; they shoved the stones down with their feet and calmly watched them break into pieces beneath them: if their pickaxes had gone wide of the mark, the mere momentum of their arms would have hurled them to the ground."

"Au lieu de rentrer chez elle, elle prit la rue du Temple, promenant son galant le long des boulevards.

"Mme Sidonie ne venait généralement qu’à la nuit tombée. Son frère avait pourtant obtenu qu’elle mît des robes de soie.

As he had half confessed, moreover, the 500,000 francs from the Sologne properties had gone into the down payment on the house and furniture, the total cost of which was nearly two million. He still owed a million to the decorator and the contractor.","A powerful motive must have impelled him to lie less than usual.

Although he paid out interest on it at the rate of two or three hundred per cent or more, he could not have produced the least security or found the smallest solid particle of the original capital. As he half confessed, moreover, the five hundred thousand francs of the Sologne property had been used to pay a first instalment on the house and the furniture, which together cost nearly two million. He still owed a million to the upholsterer and the builders."
"— Eh bien, ne vous gênez pas, dit-il en riant.","""Well, don't be shy,"" he said, laughing.","“Don’t mind me,” he said, laughing.","‘It’s all right, don’t mind me,’ he said, laughing."
"Alors, l’incestueuse s’habituait à sa faute comme à une robe de gala, dont les roideurs l’auraient d’abord gênée. Elle suivait les modes de l’époque, elle s’habillait et se déshabillait à l’exemple des autres. Elle finissait par croire qu’elle vivait au milieu d’un monde supérieur à la morale commune, où les sens s’affinaient et se développaient, où il était permis de se mettre nue pour la joie de l’Olympe entier. Le mal devenait un luxe, une fleur piquée dans les cheveux, un diamant attaché sur le front. Et elle revoyait, comme une justification et une rédemption, l’empereur, au bras du général, passer entre les deux files d’épaules inclinées.","So the incestuous woman got used to her fault like a gala dress, the stiffness of which would have bothered her at first. She followed the fashions of the time, she dressed and undressed following the example of others. She ended up believing that she lived in the midst of a world superior to common morality, where the senses were refined and developed, where it was permissible to strip naked for the joy of the whole Olympus. Evil became a luxury, a flower stuck in the hair, a diamond attached to the forehead. And she saw again, like a justification and a redemption, the Emperor, on the general's arm, passing between the two rows of bowed shoulders.","Eventually Renée got used to her incest as one might get used to a ball gown which at first seemed unbearably stiff. In the end she came to believe that she was living in a world apart, superior to the common morality, a world in which the senses could be refined and developed and where it was permissible to bare one’s flesh for the delectation of all Olympus. 10 Sin became a luxury, a flower stuck in her hair, a diamond affixed to her forehead. And as justification and redemption she once again conjured up the image of the Emperor passing between the two rows of bowed shoulders on the general’s arm.","Then the incestuous woman grew accustomed to her sin, as to a gala-dress whose stiffness had at first bothered her. She followed the fashions, she dressed and undressed as others did.

Sin became a luxury, a flower set in her hair, a diamond fastened on her brow. She remembered, as a form of justification and redemption, the Emperor passing by on the general’s arm between the two rows of bowing shoulders."

"C’était, en langue ministérielle, le même mot que celui des Mignon et Charrier. Alors M. Toutin-Laroche et les autres firent leur cour, jouèrent sur la dernière phrase du ministre : l’Empire avait déjà fait des merveilles ; ce n’était pas l’or qui manquait, grâce à la haute expérience du pouvoir ; jamais la France n’avait eu une situation aussi belle devant l’Europe ; et ces messieurs finirent par devenir si plats, que le ministre changea lui-même la conversation. Il les écoutait, la tête haute, les coins de la bouche un peu relevés, ce qui donnait à sa grosse face blanche, soigneusement rasée, un air de doute et de dédain souriant.","It was, in ministerial language, the same word as that of Mignon and Charrier. Then M. Toutin-Laroche and the others paid court, played on the minister's last sentence: the Empire had already done wonders; there was no lack of gold, thanks to the high experience of power; France had never had such a fine position before Europe; and these gentlemen ended by becoming so dull that the minister himself changed the conversation. He listened to them with his head held high, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, which gave his big white face, carefully shaven, an air of doubt and smiling disdain.","This was the same remark that Mignon and Charrier had made, but in ministerial language. Then M. Toutin-Laroche and the others made flattering comments that played off the minister’s last sentence: the Empire had already worked miracles; there was no shortage of gold, owing to the vast experience of those in power; never had France enjoyed such a splendid position in the eyes of Europe. In the end, these gentlemen prostrated themselves to such a degree that the minister himself changed the subject. He listened to them with his head held high and the corners of his mouth slightly raised, which imparted to his plump, white, carefully shaved face an air of doubt and smiling disdain.","This repeated, in ministerial language, the remark made by Mignon and Charrier. Then Monsieur Toutin-Laroche and the others paid their court, and rang the changes on the minister’s last phrase : the Empire had done wonders already; there was no lack of gold, thanks to the experience and skill of the Government; never had France stood so tall in the councils of Europe; and the gentlemen ended by uttering such platitudes that the minister himself changed the subject. He listened to them with his head high, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned, which gave his fat, white, clean-shaven face an expression of scepticism and smiling disdain."
"Renée comprit alors ce tourbillonnement des jupes, ce piétinement des jambes. Elle était placée en contrebas, elle voyait la furie des pieds, le pêle-mêle des bottes vernies et des chevilles blanches. Par moments, il lui semblait qu’un souffle de vent allait enlever les robes. Ces épaules nues, ces bras nus, ces chevelures nues qui volaient, qui tourbillonnaient, prises, jetées et reprises, au fond de cette galerie, où la valse de l’orchestre s’affolait, où les tentures rouges se pâmaient sous les fièvres dernières du bal, lui apparurent comme l’image tumultueuse de sa vie à elle, de ses nudités, de ses abandons. Et elle éprouva une telle douleur, en pensant que Maxime, pour prendre la bossue entre ses bras, venait de la jeter là, à cette place où ils s’étaient aimés, qu’elle rêva d’arracher une tige du Tanghin qui lui frôlait la joue, de la mâcher jusqu’au bois. Mais elle était lâche, elle resta devant l’arbuste à grelotter sous la fourrure que ses bras ramenaient, serraient étroitement, avec un grand geste de honte terrifiée.","Renee then understood this swirling of the skirts, this trampling of the legs. She was placed below, she saw the fury of the feet, the pell-mell of patent leather boots and white ankles. At times it seemed to her that a gust of wind was going to blow away the robes. Those bare shoulders, those bare arms, those bare hair that flew, that swirled, taken, thrown and taken again, at the end of this gallery, where the orchestra waltzed wildly, where the red hangings swooned under the last fevers of the ball, appeared to her like the tumultuous image of her own life, of her nudity, of her abandonment. And she felt such pain, thinking that Maxime, to take the hunchback in his arms, had just thrown her there, in this place where they had loved each other, that she dreamed of tearing off a stem of the Tanghin which brushed against her. the cheek, to chew it down to the wood. But she was a coward, she stood in front of the shrub, shivering under the fur that her arms pulled back, hugged tightly, with a great gesture of terrified shame.","Renée now understood this whirl of skirts, this stamping of feet. Situated as she was below the level of the dance floor, she saw the frenzy of legs, the chaos of patent-leather boots and white ankles. At times it seemed as though a gust of wind might carry off the women’s gowns. The bare shoulders, arms, and heads that flew past, that whirled by only to be caught, flung off, and caught again at the far end of the gallery where the orchestra played ever more furiously and the red hangings seemed to droop as the ball succumbed to its final fever, struck her as a tumultuous reflection of her own life, with its moments of nakedness and surrender. And she experienced such pain at the thought that Maxime, in order to take the hunchback in his arms, had cast her aside into the very spot where they had loved each other, that she dreamed of plucking a branch of the tanghin that grazed her cheek and chewing it down to the heartwood. But she was a coward, so she stood in front of the shrub shivering under the fur, which she pulled over her arms and clutched tightly in a gesture of terrified shame.","Renée suddenly understood this whirling of skirts, this prancing of legs. Standing lower down, she could see the frenzied movement of the feet, the blur of glazed shoes and white ankles. At intervals it seemed to her as if a gust of wind was about to blow away the dresses. The bare shoulders, the bare arms, the bare heads that reeled past, caught up, thrown off, and caught up again at the end of the gallery, where the music of the band grew madder and the red hangings swooned amid the final fever of the ball, seemed to her a tumultuous symbol of her life, of her self-exposure, of her wild self-indulgence. At the thought that Maxime, in order to take the hunchback in his arms, had abandoned her there, in the very spot where they had made love, she felt a pang of pain so intense that she thought of plucking a stalk of the tanghin tree that grazed her cheek, and of chewing it dry. But she was afraid, and she remained standing before the shrub, shivering under the fur, which she drew tightly around her in a gesture of terror and shame."
"— Certes, il fait bien les choses, dit Maxime sans répondre, avec un rire méchant. Il trouve moyen de payer les dettes de Laure et de donner des diamants à sa femme.","""Of course, he does things well,"" said Maxime without answering, with a nasty laugh. He finds a way to pay Laure's debts and give diamonds to his wife.","Avoiding the first question, Maxime met the second with a nasty snicker. “You have to admit that he carried it off nicely. He found a way to pay off Laure’s debts and give his wife diamonds at the same time.”","‘Yes, he does things very well,’ said Maxime without answering, laughing mischievously. ‘ He knows how to pay Laure’s debts as well as give his wife diamonds.’"
"Le jeune homme ne se retira qu’à six heures du matin. Elle lui donna la clef de la petite porte du parc Monceau, en lui faisant jurer de revenir tous les soirs.

"En bas dans le parc, une mer d’ombre roulait. Les masses couleur d’encre des hauts feuillages secoués par de brusques rafales avaient un large balancement de flux et de reflux, avec ce bruit de feuilles sèches qui rappelle l’égouttement des vagues sur une plage de cailloux. Seuls, rayant par instants ce remous de ténèbres, les deux yeux jaunes d’une voiture paraissaient et disparaissaient entre les massifs, le long de la grande allée qui va de l’avenue de la Reine-Hortense au boulevard Malesherbes. Renée, en face de ces mélancolies de l’automne, sentit toutes ses tristesses lui remonter au cœur. Elle se revit enfant dans la maison de son père, dans cet hôtel silencieux de l’île Saint-Louis, où depuis deux siècles les Béraud du Châtel mettaient leur gravité noire de magistrats. Puis elle songea au coup de baguette de son mariage, à ce veuf qui s’était vendu pour l’épouser, et qui avait troqué son nom de Rougon contre ce nom de Saccard, dont les deux syllabes sèches avaient sonné à ses oreilles, les premières fois, avec la brutalité de deux râteaux ramassant de l’or ; il la prenait, il la jetait dans cette vie à outrance, où sa pauvre tête se détraquait un peu plus tous les jours. Alors, elle se mit à rêver, avec une joie puérile, aux belles parties de raquette qu’elle avait faites jadis avec sa jeune sœur Christine. Et, quelque matin, elle s’éveillerait du rêve de jouissance qu’elle faisait depuis dix ans, folle, salie par une des spéculations de son mari, dans laquelle il se noierait lui-même. Ce fut comme un pressentiment rapide. Les arbres se lamentaient à voix plus haute. Renée, troublée par ces pensées de honte et de châtiment, céda aux instincts de vieille et honnête bourgeoisie qui dormaient au fond d’elle ; elle promit à la nuit noire de s’amender, de ne plus tant dépenser pour sa toilette, de chercher quelque jeu innocent qui pût la distraire, comme aux jours heureux du pensionnat, lorsque les élèves chantaient : Nous n’irons plus au bois, en tournant doucement sous les platanes.","Down in the park a sea of shadow rolled. The inky masses of tall foliage shaken by sudden gusts had a wide sway of ebb and flow, with that sound of dry leaves like the dripping of waves on a pebbly beach. Alone, streaking this swirl of darkness from time to time, the two yellow eyes of a carriage appeared and disappeared between the clumps of trees, along the wide alley which goes from the Avenue de la Reine-Hortense to the Boulevard Malesherbes. Renée, faced with these autumnal melancholy, felt all her sadness rise to her heart. She saw herself as a child in her father's house, in this silent hotel on the Île Saint-Louis, where for two centuries the Bérauds of Châtel had placed their black gravity as magistrates. Then she thought of the wand of her marriage, of this widower who had sold himself to marry her, and who had swapped his name of Rougon for that name of Saccard, whose two dry syllables had rang in her ears, the first times, with the brutality of two rakes picking up gold; he took her, he threw her into this excessive life, where her poor head was going out of order a little more every day. Then she began to dream, with childish joy, of the beautiful games of racket she had played long ago with her younger sister Christine. And some morning she would awaken from the dream of enjoyment she had been having for ten years, mad, sullied by one of her husband's speculations, in which he would drown himself. It was like a quick presentiment. The trees were wailing louder. Renée, disturbed by these thoughts of shame and punishment, yielded to the instincts of an old and honest bourgeoisie which lay dormant within her; she promised in the dark night to make amends, not to spend so much on her toilet, to seek some innocent game that could distract her, as in the happy days of the boarding school, when the students sang: We will no longer go to the wood, turning gently under the plane trees.","The park below was a seething sea of shadows. Inky masses of lofty foliage, buffeted by sudden gusts of wind, ebbed and flowed over a broad expanse, and the dry leaves made a sound reminiscent of waves draining from a pebbly beach. In the swirl of shadows only the two yellow eyes of an occasional carriage stood out now and then, appearing and disappearing amid the stands of trees lining the road that runs from the avenue de la Reine-Hortense to the boulevard Malesherbes. Staring at this melancholy autumn scene, Renée felt her heart fill once again with sadness. She imagined herself a child back in her father’s house, a big silent town house on the Ile Saint-Louis, 10 which for two centuries had been home to the black-robed gravity of a family of magistrates, the Béraud Du Châtels. Then she recalled the magical stroke of her marriage, to a widower who had sold himself to marry her, who had bartered the name of Rougon for that of Saccard, whose two sharp syllables had, on first hearing, struck her ear with the brutality of two rakes scraping up gold. He had taken her and propelled her into this life of excess, which with each passing day left her poor mind a little more unhinged. Then, with childish pleasure, she dreamt of the wonderful games of badminton she used to play with her younger sister, Christine. And one morning she would wake from the voluptuous dream in which she’d been living for the past ten years, and she would be mad, and her reputation would have been destroyed by some speculation of her husband’s, which would have sucked him under with it. This came to her as a quick premonition. The wailing of the trees grew louder. Upset by these thoughts of shame and punishment, Renée gave in to instincts that lay dormant deep inside her, the instincts of an old and respectable bourgeois family. She promised the dark night that she would mend her ways, spend less on clothes, and find some innocent pastime with which to amuse herself, as in her happy days at boarding school, where the girls all sang “Nous n’irons plus au bois” while cavorting sweetly under the sycamores.","A sea of shadow filled the gardens below. The tall, inky masses of foliage, shaken by sudden gusts of wind, swayed heavily to and fro as with the movement of the tides, the sound of their dead leaves like the lapping of waves on a pebbly beach. Now and then this ebb and flow of darkness was pierced by the two yellow eyes of a carriage, appearing and disappearing between the shrubbery, along the road connecting the Avenue de la Reine-Hortense with the Boulevard Malesherbes. Before this melancholic autumnal scene, Renée felt her heart fill once more with sadness. She remembered herself as a child in her father’s house, that silent house on the Île Saint-Louis, where for two centuries the Bérauds du Chatel, a family of judges, had lived sober, sombre lives. Then she thought of the suddenness of her marriage, of the widower who had sold himself to become her husband and bartered his name of Rougon for that of Saccard, the two dry syllables of which, when she first heard them, had reverberated in her ears like two rakes gathering up gold; he had taken her and cast her into this life of excess, in which her poor head was becoming more and more confused every day. Then she fell to dreaming, with childlike joy, of the pleasant games of battledore * she had played with her little sister Christine so many years before. And one morning she would awaken from the dream of pleasure she had lived in for the past ten years, mad, soiled by one of her husband’s speculations, in which he himself would go under. It came to her as a sudden foreboding. The trees sighed more loudly. Renée, distressed by these thoughts of shame and punishment, yielded to the instincts, dormant within her, of the honest old bourgeoisie; she made a promise to the inky black night that she would change her ways, that she would spend less on clothes, seek some innocent amusement, as in her happy schooldays when the girls sang ‘Nous n’irons plus au bois’ as they danced slowly under the plane trees."

"Bientôt, remuant les capitaux à la pelle, il eut huit maisons sur les nouveaux boulevards. Il en avait quatre complètement terminées, deux rue de Marignan, et deux sur le boulevard Haussmann ; les quatre autres, situées sur le boulevard Malesherbes, restaient en construction, et même une d’elles, vaste enclos de planches où devait s’élever un magnifique hôtel, n’avait encore de posé que le plancher du premier étage. À cette époque, ses affaires se compliquèrent tellement, il avait tant de fils attachés à chacun de ses doigts, tant d’intérêts à surveiller et de marionnettes à faire mouvoir, qu’il dormait à peine trois heures par nuit et qu’il lisait sa correspondance dans sa voiture.","Soon, stirring up capital by the shovel, he had eight houses on the new boulevards.

"Elle se pencha de nouveau. Au milieu, sur la chaussée, les fiacres et les omnibus croisaient toujours leurs yeux de couleur, plus rares et plus rapides. Mais, sur les côtés, le long des trottoirs, de grands trous d’ombre s’étaient creusés, devant les boutiques fermées. Les cafés seuls flambaient encore, rayant l’asphalte de nappes lumineuses. De la rue Drouot à la rue du Helder, elle apercevait ainsi une longue file de carrés blancs et de carrés noirs, dans lesquels les derniers promeneurs surgissaient et s’évanouissaient d’une étrange façon. Les filles surtout, avec la traîne de leur robe, tour à tour crûment éclairées et noyées dans l’ombre, prenaient un air d’apparition, de marionnettes blafardes, traversant le rayon électrique de quelque féerie. Elle s’amusa un moment à ce jeu. Il n’y avait plus de lumière épandue ; les becs de gaz s’éteignaient ; les kiosques bariolés tachaient les ténèbres plus durement. Par instants, un flot de foule, la sortie de quelque théâtre, passait. Mais des vides se faisaient bientôt, et il venait, sous la fenêtre, des groupes de deux ou trois hommes qu’une femme abordait. Ils restaient debout, discutant. Dans le tapage affaibli, quelques-unes de leurs paroles montaient ; puis, la femme, le plus souvent, s’en allait au bras d’un des hommes. D’autres filles se rendaient de café en café, faisaient le tour des tables, prenaient le sucre oublié, riaient avec les garçons, regardaient fixement, d’un air d’interrogation et d’offre silencieuses, les consommateurs attardés. Et comme Renée venait de suivre des yeux l’impériale presque vide d’un omnibus des Batignolles, elle reconnut, au coin du trottoir, la femme à la robe bleue et aux guipures blanches, droite, tournant la tête, toujours en quête.","She leaned over again. In the middle, on the road, the cabs and omnibuses still met their colored eyes, rarer and faster. But, on the sides, along the sidewalks, large shadowy holes had been dug, in front of the closed shops. The cafes alone were still blazing, streaking the asphalt with sheets of light. From the rue Drouot to the rue du Helder, she could thus see a long line of white squares and black squares, in which the last passers-by appeared and vanished in a strange way. The girls especially, with the train of their dresses, alternately starkly lit and drowned in shadow, assumed the air of apparitions, of pale puppets, traversing the electric ray of some fairyland. She amused herself for a moment at this game. There was no longer any light shed; the gaslights were extinguished; the motley kiosks stained the darkness more harshly. From time to time, a flood of crowd, the exit of some theater, passed. But gaps soon formed, and there came, under the window, groups of two or three men whom a woman accosted. They remained standing, discussing. In the fading uproar some of their words rose; then the woman most often went off on the arm of one of the men. Other girls were going from cafe to cafe, making the rounds of the tables, taking the forgotten sugar, laughing with the waiters, gazing fixedly, with an air of questioning and silent offer, at the belated consumers. And as Renée had just followed with her eyes the almost empty top of an omnibus from Batignolles, she recognized, at the corner of the sidewalk, the woman in the blue dress and the white guipure laces, upright, turning her head, still searching.","She leaned out again. Out in the middle of the street, cabs and omnibuses, rarer now and moving more rapidly than before, stared at each other with various-colored eyes as they passed. But along the sidewalks great pits of darkness had opened up in front of the closed shops. Only the cafés remained ablaze, striping the asphalt with streaks of light. From the rue Drouot to the rue du Helder Renée was thus able to observe a long series of white squares alternating with dark, from which the last stragglers emerged only to vanish again in the strangest way. The prostitutes above all, their long dresses alternately illuminated by a harsh light and then drowned in shadow, took on a ghostly air, like faded marionettes caught in the electric beam of some fantastic extravaganza. For a short while Renée found this game amusing. The puddles of light evaporated. The gaslights flickered out. The variegated kiosks stained the darkness more brightly than before. At intervals a crowd of people from some theater hurried past. Gaps began to open up in the flow, however, and groups of two or three men passed beneath the window and were approached by a woman. They stood and haggled. Some of what they said could be heard above the dying din. Usually the woman then went off on the arm of one of the men. Other streetwalkers moved from café to café, making the rounds of the tables, snatching forgotten cubes of sugar, laughing with the waiters, and staring steadily at the lingering customers with questioning looks and unspoken propositions. And Renée, who had been studying the nearly empty upper deck of a Batignolles omnibus, happened to recognize the woman in the blue dress and white lace, now standing at the street corner and turning her head from side to side, still on the prowl.","She leant out again. In the middle of the road the coloured eyes of the cabs and omnibuses, now fewer and faster, were still crossing one another. But on either side, along the pavements, great pits of darkness had appeared in front of the closed shops. The cafés alone were still ablaze, streaking the asphalt with sheets of light. From the Rue Drouot to the Rue du Helder she could see a long line of black and white squares, in which the last stragglers sprang up and disappeared in a curious fashion. The prostitutes in particular, with their long-trained dresses, by turns garishly illuminated and immersed in darkness, seemed like apparitions, ghostly puppets moving across a floodlit stage-set. She amused herself for a moment with this sight. The gas jets were being turned out; the variegated kiosks stood out in the darkness. From time to time a flood of people, issuing from some theatre, passed by. But soon there was no one except, under the window, groups of men in twos or threes whom a woman accosted. They stood talking. Some of their remarks rose audibly in the subsiding din; and then the women generally walked off on the arm of one of the men. Other girls wandered from café to café, strolled round the tables, pocketed the forgotten lumps of sugar, laughed with the waiters, and stared invitingly at the belated customers. And just after Renée had followed with her eyes the all but empty upper deck of a Batignolles omnibus, she recognized on the pavement the woman in the blue dress with the white lace, glancing about her, still in search of a customer."

"D’autres mots peu obligeants couraient. Ce troisième tableau n’eut pas le succès franc des deux autres. C’était pourtant ce dénouement tragique qui enthousiasmait M. Hupel de la Noue sur son propre talent. Il s’y admirait, comme son Narcisse dans sa lame de glace. Il y avait mis une foule d’intentions poétiques et philosophiques. Quand les rideaux se furent refermés pour la dernière fois, et que les spectateurs eurent applaudi en gens bien élevés, il éprouva un regret mortel d’avoir cédé à la colère en n’expliquant pas la dernière page de son poème. Il voulut donner alors aux personnes qui l’entouraient la clef des choses charmantes, grandioses ou simplement polissonnes, que représentaient le beau Narcisse et la nymphe Écho, et il essaya même de dire ce que Vénus et Plutus faisaient au fond de la clairière ; mais ces messieurs et ces dames, dont les esprits nets et pratiques avaient compris la grotte de la chair et la grotte de l’or, ne se souciaient pas de descendre dans les complications mythologiques du préfet. Seuls, les Mignon et Charrier, qui voulaient absolument savoir, eurent la bonhomie de l’interroger.

When the curtains had closed for the last time, and the spectators had applauded like well-bred people, he felt a mortal regret for having yielded to anger by not explaining the last page of his poem. He then wanted to give the people around him the key to the charming, grandiose or simply naughty things represented by the handsome Narcissus and the nymph Echo, and he even tried to say what Venus and Plutus were doing at the bottom of the clearing; but these gentlemen and ladies, whose sharp and practical minds had understood the cave of flesh and the cave of gold, cared not to descend into the prefect's mythological complications. Only the Mignons and Charrier, who absolutely wanted to know, had the kindness to question him.

"Renée, les joues roses, avançait d’un pas vif. Céleste avait fait craquer un premier maillot ; heureusement que la jeune femme, prévoyant le cas, s’était précautionnée.

"Renée avait refusé de prendre part au cotillon. Elle était d’une gaieté nerveuse, depuis le commencement du bal, dansant à peine, se mêlant aux groupes, ne pouvant rester en place.

"La salle à manger était une vaste pièce carrée, dont les boiseries de poirier noirci et verni montaient à hauteur d’homme, ornées de minces filets d’or. Les quatre grands panneaux avaient dû être ménagés de façon à recevoir des peintures de nature morte ; mais ils étaient restés vides, le propriétaire de l’hôtel ayant sans doute reculé devant une dépense purement artistique. On les avait simplement tendus de velours gros vert.

The four large panels must have been intended to hold still lifes, but they remained empty, no doubt because the owner of the house had recoiled at the thought of spending so much for mere works of art. Swaths of bright green velvet filled the space instead. Upholstery, drapes, and door curtains of the same fabric gave the room a grave and sober character calculated to focus all the radiance of the lighting on the table.","The dining room was a huge, square chamber, whose panelling of varnished pear-wood rose to head height and was decorated with thin gold beading.

"Sans doute Maxime sentit tout le mauvais ton qu’il y avait à trouver la vie drôle. S’il était encore assez jeune pour se livrer à un élan d’heureuse admiration, il avait un égoïsme trop large, une indifférence trop railleuse, il éprouvait déjà trop de lassitude réelle, pour ne pas se déclarer écœuré, blasé, fini. D’ordinaire, il mettait quelque gloire à cet aveu.","No doubt Maxime sensed all the bad taste there was in finding life funny. If he was still young enough to indulge in a surge of happy admiration, he had too broad an egotism, too mocking an indifference, he already experienced too much real weariness not to declare himself disgusted, jaded, finished. Ordinarily, he gave some glory to this confession.","Maxime was of course fully aware that it was quite bad form to think that life was a barrel of laughs. Though still young enough to succumb to bursts of enthusiasm, he had a selfish streak too deep, an indifference too scornful, and had already experienced too much genuine lassitude not to pronounce himself disgusted, blasé, and at the end of his tether. Ordinarily he would have taken a certain pride in such a confession.","Maxime undoubtedly appreciated the bad form of thinking that life could be enjoyable.

"On trouva généralement que Maxime était admirablement fait. Dans son geste de refus, il développait sa hanche gauche, qu’on remarqua beaucoup. Mais tous les éloges furent pour l’expression de visage de Renée. Selon le mot de M. Hupel de la Noue, elle était « la douleur du désir inassouvi ». Elle avait un sourire aigu qui cherchait à se faire humble, elle quêtait sa proie avec des supplications de louve affamée qui ne cache ses dents qu’à demi. Le premier tableau marcha bien, sauf cette folle d’Adeline qui bougeait et qui retenait à grand-peine une irrésistible envie de rire. Puis, les rideaux se refermèrent, le piano se tut.","Maxime was generally thought to be admirably made. In his gesture of refusal, he developed his left hip, which was much noticed. But all the praise was for Renee's facial expression. In the words of M. Hupel de la Noue, it was “the pain of unfulfilled desire”. She had a sharp smile that sought to be humble, she sought her prey with the pleas of a hungry wolf that only half hides her teeth. The first painting went well, except for this mad Adeline who was moving and barely suppressing an irresistible desire to laugh. Then the curtains closed, the piano fell silent.","The audience on the whole thought Maxime looked remarkably good. In making his gesture of refusal, he thrust out his left hip, which drew considerable comment. But the lion’s share of the praise was reserved for the expression on Renée’s face. As M. Hupel de la Noue put it, she represented “the suffering of unsatisfied desire.” She wore an avid smile that she tried to disguise as humble and tracked her prey as hungrily as a she-wolf, her teeth only half-hidden. The first tableau went off well, except that foolish Adeline was fidgety and had a hard time suppressing an overwhelming urge to laugh. Then the curtains closed and the piano fell silent.","It was generally thought that Maxime embodied the part very well. In making his gesture of refusal he accentuated his left hip, which was much remarked upon. But all the praise was for Renée’s expression.

"Le piano sanglotait mollement. Sur l’estrade, une clairière, où le rayon électrique mettait une nappe de soleil, ouvrait un horizon de feuilles. C’était une clairière idéale, avec des arbres bleus, de grandes fleurs jaunes et rouges, qui montaient aussi haut que les chênes. Là, sur une butte de gazon, Vénus et Plutus se tenaient côte à côte, entourés de nymphes accourues des taillis voisins pour leur faire escorte. Il y avait les filles des arbres, les filles des sources, les filles des monts, toutes les divinités rieuses et nues de la forêt. Et le dieu et la déesse triomphaient, punissaient les froideurs de l’orgueilleux qui les avait méprisés, tandis que le groupe des nymphes regardaient curieusement, avec un effroi sacré, la vengeance de l’Olympe, au premier plan. Le drame s’y dénouait. Le beau Narcisse, couché sur le bord d’un ruisseau, qui descendait du lointain de la scène, se regardait dans le clair miroir ; et l’on avait poussé la vérité jusqu’à mettre une lame de vraie glace au fond du ruisseau. Mais ce n’était déjà plus le jeune homme libre, le rôdeur de forêts ; la mort le surprenait au milieu de l’admiration ravie de son image, la mort l’alanguissait, et Vénus, de son doigt tendu, comme une fée d’apothéose, lui jetait le sort fatal. Il devenait fleur. Ses membres verdissaient, s’allongeaient, dans son costume collant de satin vert ; la tige flexible, les jambes légèrement recourbées, allaient s’enfoncer en terre, prendre racine, pendant que le buste, orné de larges pans de satin blanc, s’épanouissait en une corolle merveilleuse. La chevelure blonde de Maxime complétait l’illusion, mettait, avec ses longues frisures, des pistils jaunes au milieu de la blancheur des pétales. Et la grande fleur naissante, humaine encore, penchait la tête vers la source, les yeux noyés, le visage souriant d’une extase voluptueuse, comme si le beau Narcisse eût enfin contenté dans la mort les désirs qu’il s’était inspirés à lui-même. À quelques pas, la nymphe Écho se mourait aussi, se mourait de désirs inassouvis ; elle se trouvait peu à peu prise dans la raideur du sol, elle sentait ses membres brûlants se glacer et se durcir. Elle n’était pas rocher vulgaire, sali de mousse, mais marbre blanc, par ses épaules et ses bras, par sa grande robe de neige, dont la ceinture de feuillage et l’écharpe bleue avaient glissé. Affaissée au milieu du satin de sa jupe, qui se cassait à larges plis, pareil à un bloc de Paros[45] , elle se renversait, n’ayant plus de vivant, dans son corps figé de statue, que ses yeux de femme, des yeux qui luisaient, fixés sur la fleur des eaux, penchée languissamment sur le miroir de la source. Et il semblait déjà que tous les bruits d’amour de la forêt, les voix prolongées des taillis, les frissons mystérieux des feuilles, les soupirs profonds des grands chênes, venaient battre sur la chair de marbre de la nymphe Écho, dont le cœur, saignant toujours dans le bloc, résonnait longuement, répétait au loin les moindres plaintes de la Terre et de l’Air.","The piano was sobbing softly. On the platform, a clearing, where the electric ray cast a sheet of sunlight, opened a horizon of leaves. It was an ideal clearing, with blue trees, big yellow and red flowers, which rose as high as the oaks. There, on a mound of grass, Venus and Plutus stood side by side, surrounded by nymphs running from the nearby thickets to escort them. There were the daughters of the trees, the daughters of the springs, the daughters of the mountains, all the laughing and naked divinities of the forest. And the god and goddess triumphed, punishing the coldness of the proud who had despised them, while the group of nymphs looked curiously, with sacred dread, at the vengeance of Olympus, in the foreground. The drama unraveled there. The handsome Narcissus, lying on the edge of a stream, which descended from the distance of the stage, looked at himself in the clear mirror; and the truth had been pushed so far as to put a blade of real ice at the bottom of the stream. But he was already no longer the free young man, the prowler of the forests; death surprised him in the midst of the rapturous admiration of his image, death languished him, and Venus, with her outstretched finger, like a fairy of apotheosis, cast the fatal spell on him. He became a flower. Her limbs grew green, lengthened, in her tight suit of green satin; the flexible stem, the slightly curved legs, were going to sink into the ground, take root, while the bust, adorned with large panels of white satin, blossomed into a marvelous corolla. Maxime's blond hair completed the illusion, putting, with its long curls, yellow pistils in the middle of the whiteness of the petals. And the great budding flower, still human, bent her head towards the source, her eyes drowned, her face smiling with voluptuous ecstasy, as if the handsome Narcissus had finally satisfied in death the desires he had inspired in himself. A few steps away, the nymph Echo was also dying, dying of unfulfilled desires; little by little she found herself caught in the stiffness of the ground, she felt her burning limbs freezing and hardening. She was not vulgar rock, soiled with moss, but white marble, by her shoulders and her arms, by her great dress of snow, from which the belt of foliage and the blue scarf had slipped. Slumped in the middle of the satin of her skirt, which broke in large folds, like a block of Paros[45], she fell back, having nothing left alive, in her frozen statue-like body, but her woman's eyes, eyes that gleamed, fixed on the flower of the waters, leaning languidly over the mirror of the spring. And it already seemed that all the love sounds of the forest, the prolonged voices of the thickets, the mysterious quivering of the leaves, the deep sighs of the great oaks, came to beat on the marble flesh of the nymph Echo, whose heart, still bleeding in the block, echoed for a long time, repeated in the distance the slightest complaints of Earth and Air.","The piano sobbed softly. Onstage, a clearing, dappled with “sunlight ” from the electric arc, opened onto a horizon of foliage. It was a fanciful clearing, a sort of glade with blue trees and big yellow and red flowers that grew as tall as oaks. There, on a grassy knoll, Venus and Plutus stood side by side, surrounded by nymphs from the nearby woods, who had hastened to them to form an escort. Among them were daughters of the trees, daughters of the springs, daughters of the mountains—all the laughing, naked deities of the forest. And the god and goddess stood in triumph, punishing the indifference of the proud youth who had scorned them, while the group of nymphs gazed with sacred terror upon the vengeance of Olympus unfolding in the foreground. Handsome Narcissus, lying beside a stream that seemed to flow out of the backdrop, stared at his image in that limpid mirror. Verisimilitude had been carried to the point of placing an actual mirror at the bottom of the stream. But this was no longer the free-spirited youth who had roamed the forest. Death had caught him by surprise as he lay in rapt admiration of his own image; it had made him weak, and Venus, with her finger outstretched like a fairy in a transformation scene, was casting her fatal spell. He was changing into a flower. His limbs seemed to turn green and grow longer inside his green satin tights. His supple trunk and slightly curved legs seemed to sink into the ground and take root, while the upper part of his body, festooned with wide strips of white satin, opened out into a marvelous corolla. Maxime’s blond hair completed the illusion, as his long curls could be taken for yellow pistils with white petals all around. And this great nascent flower, still human, tilted its head toward the spring—its eyes dimmed, its face smiling in voluptuous ecstasy, as if handsome Narcissus had at last, in death, satisfied the desires he had awakened in himself. A short distance away, the nymph Echo also lay dying—dying of unsatisfied desires. Little by little she felt herself gripped by the rigidity of the earth, as her burning limbs froze and hardened. She was no ordinary rock, stained by moss, but white marble by dint of her shoulders and arms and her great snowy white gown, from which the leafy girdle and blue sash had slipped away. Collapsed at the center of her satin skirt, which had gathered around her in wide folds like a block of Paros marble, she thrust herself backward, her body as rigid as a statue with nothing left of life in her other than her gleaming female eyes, which were fixed on the aquatic flower swaying languorously over the mirror of the spring. And already it seemed as if all the love sounds of the forest, all the lingering voices of the glades, all the mysterious quivering of the leaves, all the deep sighs of the great oaks had sought out the nymph’s marble flesh to beat upon, while her heart, still bleeding deep within the block of stone that was her body, continued to echo the least moans of Earth and Air.","The piano sobbed softly. On the stage, a glade into which the electric light threw a shaft of sunshine revealed a vista of foliage. It was an ideal glade, with blue trees and big red and yellow flowers that rose as high as the oaks. There, on a grassy knoll, lay Venus and Plutus, side by side, surrounded by nymphs who had hurried from the neighbouring thickets to serve as their escort. There were daughters of the trees, daughters of the springs, daughters of the mountains, all the laughing, naked divinities of the forest. The god and goddess triumphed, punished the indifference of the proud one who had scorned them, while the group of nymphs looked on curiously and in pious terror at the vengeance of Olympus in the foreground. There the drama unfolded. The handsome Narcissus, lying at the edge of a pool that came down from the back of the stage, was looking at himself in the limpid mirror; and realism had been carried so far that a piece of real looking-glass had been placed at the bottom of the pool. But he had already ceased to be a free young man, the forest wanderer. Death surprised him in the midst of his rapt admiration of his own image, Death enervated him, and Venus, her finger outstretched, like a fairy in a transformation scene, cast the fatal spell. He was turning into a flower. His limbs became verdant, elongated, in his tight-fitting costume of green satin; the flexible stalk, formed by his slightly bent legs, was on the point of sinking into the ground and taking root, while his body, adorned with broad lappets of white satin, blossomed into a wondrous corolla. Maxime’s fair hair completed the illusion, and his long curls set yellow pistils amid the whiteness of the petals. The great nascent flower, still human, inclined its head towards the spring, its eyes moist, its countenance smiling in voluptuous ecstasy, as if Narcissus had satisfied in death the passion he had inspired in himself. A few paces away Echo was dying of frustrated desire; she found herself caught little by little in the hard ground, she felt her burning limbs freezing and stiffening. She was no vulgar moss-stained rock, but one of white marble, through her arms and shoulders, through her long snow-white robe, from which the girdle of leaves and the blue drapery had slipped down. Sinking into the satin of her skirt, which was creased in large folds, like a block of Parian marble,* she threw herself back, retaining nothing of life in her cold sculptured body except her gleaming eyes, fixed on the water-lily reclining languidly above the mirror of the spring. It already seemed as if all the love-sounds of the forest, the long-drawn-out voices of the thickets, the mystic shivers of the leaves, the deep sighs of the tall oaks, were beating upon the marble flesh of Echo, whose heart, still bleeding within the rock, continued to throb, repeating from afar the slightest complaints of Earth and Air."
"Charles s’inclina, remonta quelques marches, ouvrit la porte d’un cabinet. Le gaz était baissé, il sembla à Renée qu’elle pénétrait dans le demi-jour d’un lieu suspect et charmant.","Charles bowed, went up a few steps, opened the door of a closet. The gas was turned down, it seemed to Renée that she was entering the half-light of a suspicious and charming place.","Charles bowed, climbed back up a few steps, and opened the door of a private room.

The gas was lowered, it seemed to Renée as if she was penetrating into the half-light of a dubious and charming region."
"Mais, ici, sa voix fut de nouveau couverte par des rires qui éclatèrent brusquement à l’un des bouts de la table. On entendait, au milieu de ce souffle de gaieté, la voix de Maxime, qui achevait une anecdote : « Attendez donc, je n’ai pas fini. La pauvre amazone fut relevée par un cantonnier. On dit qu’elle lui fait donner une brillante éducation pour l’épouser plus tard. Elle ne veut pas qu’un homme autre que son mari puisse se flatter d’avoir vu certain signe noir placé au-dessus de son genou. » Les rires reprirent de plus belle ; Louise riait franchement, plus haut que les hommes. Et doucement, au milieu de ces rires, comme sourd, un laquais allongeait en ce moment, entre chaque convive, sa tête grave et blême, offrant des aiguillettes de canard sauvage, à voix basse.","But here her voice was again drowned out by laughter which broke out abruptly at one end of the table. In the midst of this breath of gaiety, one could hear the voice of Maxime, who was finishing an anecdote: ""Wait, I haven't finished. The poor Amazon was picked up by a roadmender. It is said that she gives him a brilliant education to marry him later. She does not want a man other than her husband to be able to flatter himself that he has seen a certain black sign placed above her knee. The laughter started up again; Louise was laughing frankly, louder than the men. And softly, in the midst of these laughter, as if deaf, a lackey stretched out at this moment, between each guest, his grave and pale head, offering aiguillettes of wild duck, in a low voice.","At that moment, however, his voice was once again drowned out by the laughter that suddenly erupted at the far end of the table. In the midst of this burst of gaiety one could make out the voice of Maxime, who was coming to the end of an anecdote: “Wait, now, I haven’t finished. The poor amazon was picked up by a ditch digger. They say she’s arranged for him to receive an excellent education, so that she can marry him later on. No one but her husband should be able to boast of having seen a certain mole on her body somewhere above her knee.” The laughter resumed, louder than before. Louise joined in heartily, laughing even louder than the men. Softly, as if deaf to the laughter all around, the footmen at that moment stuck their grave pale faces between the shoulders of the guests and in low voices offered each of the diners a helping of aiguillettes de canard sauvage.14","At this point his voice was drowned once more in the laughter that broke out suddenly at one end of the table. In the midst of this outburst of merriment could be heard Maxime’s voice, as he concluded an anecdote: ‘Wait, I haven’t finished. The poor horsewoman was picked up by a road-labourer. They say she’s giving him a brilliant education so that she can marry him later on. Only her husband, she says, shall boast of having seen a certain black mole she’s got just above her knee.’ The laughter increased; Louise laughed heartily, louder than the men. And amid this laughter, as though deaf, a footman interposed his pale, serious face between each guest, discreetly offering slices of wild duck."
"Quand Maxime fut tâté à ce sujet, il éprouva un embarras. Louise l’amusait, la dot le tentait plus encore. Il dit oui, il accepta toutes les dates que Saccard voulut, pour s’éviter l’ennui d’une discussion. Mais, au fond, il s’avouait que, malheureusement, les choses ne s’arrangeraient pas avec une si belle facilité. Renée ne voudrait jamais ; elle pleurerait, elle lui ferait des scènes, elle était capable de commettre quelque gros scandale pour étonner Paris. C’était bien désagréable. Maintenant, elle lui faisait peur. Elle le couvait avec des yeux inquiétants, elle le possédait si despotiquement, qu’il croyait sentir des griffes s’enfoncer dans son épaule, quand elle posait là sa main blanche. Sa turbulence devenait de la brusquerie, et il y avait des sons brisés au fond de ses rires. Il craignait réellement qu’elle ne devînt folle, une nuit, entre ses bras. Chez elle le remords, la crainte d’être surprise, les joies cruelles de l’adultère, ne se traduisaient pas comme chez les autres femmes, par des larmes et des accablements, mais par une extravagance plus haute, par un besoin de tapage plus irrésistible. Et, au milieu de son effarement grandissant, on commençait à entendre un râle, le détraquement de cette adorable et étonnante machine qui se cassait.","When Maxime was probed on this subject, he felt embarrassed. Louise amused him, the dowry tempted him even more. He said yes, he accepted all the dates Saccard wanted, to avoid the boredom of a discussion. But, deep down, he admitted to himself that, unfortunately, things would not work out so easily. Renée would never want to; she would cry, she would make a scene for him, she was capable of committing some big scandal to astonish Paris. It was quite unpleasant. Now she scared him. She brooded over him with disquieting eyes, she possessed him so despotically that he thought he felt claws sink into his shoulder when she laid her white hand there. His turbulence was turning into abruptness, and there were broken sounds in the depths of his laughter. He was really afraid that she would go mad one night in his arms. In her remorse, the fear of being surprised, the cruel joys of adultery, were not expressed as in other women, by tears and despondency, but by a loftier extravagance, by a need for a greater uproar. irresistible. And, in the midst of his growing bewilderment, one began to hear a death rattle, the disruption of this adorable and astonishing machine which was breaking.","When Maxime was sounded out on this subject, he found himself in a quandary. Louise amused him, and the dowry tempted him even more. He said yes and agreed to all the dates Saccard proposed so as to avoid the vexation of further discussion. Inwardly, however, he acknowledged that unfortunately things were unlikely to work themselves out quite so easily. Renée would never go along. She would weep, she would make scenes, she was capable of causing a scandal big enough to set Paris on its ear. It was quite unpleasant. Lately she frightened him. She doted on him with such anxious eyes, she possessed him so despotically, that he could almost feel her claws digging into his skin each time she placed her white hand on his shoulder. Her restlessness became impetuousness, and there was a new staccato note in her laughter. He truly feared that some night she might go mad in his arms. In her, the remorse, the fear of being caught, and the cruel pleasures of adultery expressed themselves, not as with other women in the form of tears and misery, but as a more unfettered extravagance and a more irresistible need to kick up a fuss. As her terror increased, a rattle began to make itself heard, a sound that signaled a breakdown of this lovely and astonishing machine, which was falling to pieces.","When Maxime was sounded out on the subject, he felt embarrassed.

She gave him terrible looks, she possessed him so despotically that he thought he could feel claws digging into his shoulder when she laid her white hand on it. Her unruliness turned to roughness, and there was a cracking sound beneath her laughter. He really feared that one night she would go mad in his arms. Remorse, the fear of being surprised, the cruel joys of adultery, did not manifest themselves in her as in other women, through tears and dejection, but in ever greater extravagance. Amid her growing distraction, a rattling sound could be heard, the sound of a wonderful, bewildering machine beginning to break down."
"Derrière les massifs, une seconde allée, plus étroite, faisait le tour de la serre. Là, sur des gradins, cachant à demi les tuyaux de chauffage, fleurissaient les Maranta, douces au toucher comme du velours, les Gloxinia, aux cloches violettes, les Dracena, semblables à des lames de vieille laque vernie.","Behind the clumps, a second, narrower alley went around the greenhouse. There, on the tiers, half hiding the heating pipes, bloomed the Maranta, soft to the touch like velvet, the Gloxinia, with violet bells, the Dracena, resembling strips of old varnished lacquer.","Behind the clumps of trees a second, narrower path circled the outer circumference of the conservatory.

There, on little terraces, half concealing the hot-water pipes, bloomed marantas, soft as velvet to the touch, gloxinias, purple-belled, and dracoenas that looked like blades of old lacquer."

"Renée eut froid au cœur. Elle voyait Céleste passer derrière elle et Maxime, pendant qu’ils s’embrassaient, et elle la voyait avec son indifférence, son parfait détachement, songeant à ses cinq mille francs. Elle essaya pourtant encore de la retenir, épouvantée du vide où elle allait vivre, rêvant malgré tout de garder auprès d’elle cette bête entêtée qu’elle avait crue dévouée, et qui n’était qu’égoïste. L’autre souriait, branlait toujours la tête, en murmurant :","Renée felt cold at heart. She saw Céleste pass behind her and Maxime while they were embracing, and she saw her with her indifference, her perfect detachment, thinking of her five thousand francs. Yet she still tried to hold her back, terrified of the emptiness in which she was to live, dreaming in spite of everything of keeping this stubborn animal with her, whom she had believed to be devoted, and who was only selfish. The other smiled, still shaking his head, murmuring:","Renée’s blood ran cold. She had a vision of Céleste passing behind her and Maxime while they were kissing, and she recognized the maid’s indifference, her complete detachment, as she dreamt of her 5,000 francs.

The maid smiled, shook her head, and muttered, “No, it’s not possible.","Renée felt a sudden chill. She saw Céleste moving behind her and Maxime while they kissed, and she now saw her indifference, her complete detachment, thinking of her five thousand francs.

"Quand elle allait à l’hôtel Béraud, elle faisait un grand éloge de lui devant son père, que la fortune de son gendre laissait sévère et froid. Son mépris s’en était allé ; cet homme semblait si convaincu que la vie n’est qu’une affaire, il était si évidemment né pour battre monnaie avec tout ce qui lui tombait sous les mains : femmes, enfants, pavés, sacs de plâtre, consciences, qu’elle ne pouvait lui reprocher le marché de leur mariage. Depuis ce marché, il la regardait un peu comme une de ces belles maisons qui lui faisaient honneur et dont il espérait tirer de gros profits. Il la voulait bien mise, bruyante, faisant tourner la tête à tout Paris. Cela le posait, doublait le chiffre probable de sa fortune. Il était beau, jeune, amoureux, écervelé, par sa femme. Elle était une associée, une complice sans le savoir. Un nouvel attelage, une toilette de deux mille écus, une complaisance pour quelque amant, facilitèrent, décidèrent souvent ses plus heureuses affaires. Souvent aussi il se prétendait accablé, l’envoyait chez un ministre, chez un fonctionnaire quelconque, pour solliciter une autorisation ou recevoir une réponse. Il lui disait : « Et sois sage ! » d’un ton qui n’appartenait qu’à lui, à la fois railleur et câlin. Et quand elle revenait, qu’elle avait réussi, il se frottait les mains, en répétant son fameux : « Et tu as été sage ! » Renée riait. Il était trop actif pour souhaiter une Mme Michelin.","When she went to the Hôtel Béraud, she praised him highly in front of her father, whom his son-in-law's fortune left stern and cold. His contempt was gone; this man seemed so convinced that life is just a business, he was so obviously born to coin money with everything that came to hand: women, children, cobblestones, sacks of plaster, consciences, that she did not could blame him for the deal in their marriage. Since this market, he looked at it a bit like one of those beautiful houses that did him honor and from which he hoped to derive large profits. He wanted it well dressed, noisy, turning the heads of all Paris. This put him to rest, doubling the probable figure of his fortune. He was handsome, young, in love, scatterbrained, by his wife. She was an associate, an accomplice without knowing it. A new team, a dress costing two thousand crowns, a kindness for some lover, facilitated and often decided his happiest affairs. Often, too, he pretended to be overwhelmed, sent him to a minister, to some official, to solicit authorization or receive an answer. He said to him: “And be wise! in a tone that belonged only to him, both mocking and cuddly. And when she returned, that she had succeeded, he rubbed his hands, repeating his famous: ""And you were good!"" Renee laughed. He was too active to wish for a Mrs. Michelin.","Whenever she visited the Béraud household, she praised him to her father, who remained severe and cold toward his son-in-law despite his good fortune.

Since striking that bargain, he looked at her in much the same way as he looked at those beautiful houses that earned him esteem and would hopefully bring him huge profits. He liked to see her well dressed, making a splash, turning heads all over Paris. This enhanced his stature and made people double their estimate of his probable net worth. Because of his wife, people thought him handsome, young, amorous, and giddy. She was a partner, an unwitting accomplice. A new team of horses, an outfit that cost 2,000 écus, an indulgence for one of her lovers facilitated some of his best deals and frequently turned out to be the decisive factor. Often, too, he pretended to be busy and sent her in his stead to seek a necessary authorization from some minister or official or to receive his reply. On such occasions he would tell her, “And be good, now!” in a tone of voice that was all his own, at once mocking and cajoling.

"Cependant le ministre se retirait. Il s’excusa de ne pouvoir attendre la belle Mme Saccard pour la complimenter sur la grâce parfaite de la nymphe Écho.

"Lorsque la grande calèche les emportait au Bois et les roulait mollement le long des allées, se contant des gravelures à l’oreille, cherchant dans leur enfance les polissonneries de l’instinct, ce n’était là qu’une déviation et qu’un contentement inavoué de leurs désirs. Ils se sentaient vaguement coupables, comme s’ils s’étaient effleurés d’un attouchement ; et même ce péché originel, cette langueur des conversations ordurières qui les lassait d’une fatigue voluptueuse, les chatouillait plus doucement encore que des baisers nets et positifs. Leur camaraderie fut ainsi la marche lente de deux amoureux, qui devait fatalement un jour les mener au cabinet du café Riche et au grand lit gris et rose de Renée. Quand ils se trouvèrent aux bras l’un de l’autre, ils n’eurent pas la secousse de la faute. On eût dit de vieux amants, dont les baisers avaient des ressouvenirs. Et ils venaient de perdre tant d’heures dans un contact de tout leur être, qu’ils parlaient malgré eux de ce passé plein de leurs tendresses ignorantes.","When the big carriage took them to the Bois and rolled them gently along the alleys, telling themselves of the scratches in their ears, seeking in their childhood the pranks of instinct, that was only a deviation and a unacknowledged contentment of their desires. They felt vaguely guilty, as if they had touched each other; and even that original sin, that languor of filthy conversations which weary them with a voluptuous fatigue, tickled them even more gently than clean and positive kisses. Their camaraderie was thus the slow walk of two lovers, which was bound to lead them one day to the study of the Café Riche and to Renee's big gray and pink bed. When they found themselves in each other's arms, they felt no fault. They looked like old lovers, whose kisses had memories. And they had just lost so many hours in contact with their whole being that they spoke in spite of themselves of that past full of their ignorant tenderness.","When the big calèche carried them off to the Bois and gently along its carriageways as they whispered smutty stories in each other’s ears and searched their memories of childhood for dirty jokes, it was merely a diversion of their desires, an unavowed gratification of their wants. They felt vaguely guilty, as if they had grazed each other’s flesh. Indeed, that original sin, that languor born of filthy conversations that had left them weary with voluptuous fatigue, had stimulated them more gently than frank and unmistakable kisses would have done. Their camaraderie was thus the slow progress of two lovers fated to end one day in the private room at the Café Riche and finally in Renée’s large pink-and-gray bed. When they found themselves in each other’s arms, they did not feel the shock of sin. They were like old lovers, whose kisses were steeped in nostalgia. Their two beings had been in intimate contact for so long that despite themselves they spoke of a past that had been suffused with a tenderness of which they had been unaware.","When the great calash carried them to the Bois and bore them gently along the pathways, their whispering of filthy remarks into each other’s ears, their attempt to recall the instinctive bad behaviour of their childhood, was but a digression, and a tacit gratification of their desires. They felt vaguely guilty, as if they had slightly touched one another; and even this first sin, this languor born of smutty conversations, though it wearied them with a voluptuous fatigue, titillated them even more than plain, positive kisses. Their familiarity was thus the slow progress of two lovers, and was inevitably bound to lead them one day to the private room in the Café Riche and to Renée’s great pink-and-grey bed. When they found themselves in each other’s arms, they did not even feel the shock of sin. They might have been two old lovers, whose kisses were full of memories, and who had spent so many intimate hours together that, in spite of themselves, they talked of their past, which was full of their unconscious feelings for each other."
"Ils étaient au milieu du salon, lorsque Renée sentit leurs regards se fixer sur elle. Le général la regardait avec des yeux ronds, tandis que l’empereur, levant à demi les paupières, avait des lueurs fauves dans l’hésitation grise de ses yeux brouillés. Renée, décontenancée, baissa la tête, s’inclina, ne vit plus que les rosaces du tapis. Mais elle suivait leur ombre, elle comprit qu’ils s’arrêtaient quelques secondes devant elle. Et elle crut entendre l’empereur, ce rêveur équivoque, qui murmurait, en la regardant enfoncée dans sa jupe de mousseline striée de velours :","They were in the middle of the living room when Renee felt their eyes fix on her. The General looked at her with wide eyes, while the Emperor, half raising his eyelids, had tawny gleams in the gray hesitation of his dimmed eyes. Renée, disconcerted, lowered her head, bowed, saw only the rosettes of the carpet. But she followed their shadow, she understood that they stopped a few seconds in front of her. And she thought she heard the Emperor, that equivocal dreamer, murmuring, as he watched her sunk into her velvet-streaked muslin skirt:","They had reached the middle of the reception room when Renée felt their eyes upon her. The general stared at her in astonishment, while the Emperor, raising his lids slightly, revealed a predatory gleam in the otherwise hesitant gray of his bleary gaze. Renée, taken aback, looked down and bowed until she could see nothing but the rose pattern in the carpet.

And she thought she heard the Emperor, that lascivious dreamer, murmur as he gazed at her tightly wrapped in her skirt of muslin","They were in the middle of the room when Renée felt their eyes fixed upon her.

"— J’étais venue pour vous recommander un nouveau savon, dit-elle en reprenant sa voix de courtière. Je m’intéresse beaucoup à l’inventeur, qui est un charmant jeune homme.

"Aristide avait une sœur à Paris. Sidonie Rougon s’était mariée à un clerc d’avoué de Plassans qui était venu tenter avec elle, rue Saint-Honoré, le commerce des fruits du Midi. Quand son frère la retrouva, le mari avait disparu, et le magasin était mangé depuis longtemps. Elle habitait, rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, un petit entresol, composé de trois pièces. Elle louait aussi la boutique du bas, située sous son appartement, une boutique étroite et mystérieuse, dans laquelle elle prétendait tenir un commerce de dentelles ; il y avait effectivement, dans la vitrine, des bouts de guipure et de la valencienne, pendus sur des tringles dorées ; mais, à l’intérieur, on eût dit une antichambre, aux boiseries luisantes, sans la moindre apparence de marchandises. La porte et la vitrine étaient garnies de légers rideaux qui, en mettant le magasin à l’abri des regards de la rue, achevaient de lui donner l’air discret et voilé d’une pièce d’attente, s’ouvrant sur quelque temple inconnu. Il était rare qu’on vît entrer une cliente chez Mme Sidonie ; le plus souvent même, le bouton de la porte était enlevé. Dans le quartier, elle répétait qu’elle allait elle-même offrir ses dentelles aux femmes riches. L’aménagement de l’appartement lui avait seul fait, disait-elle, louer la boutique et l’entresol qui communiquaient par un escalier caché dans le mur. En effet, la marchande de dentelles était toujours dehors ; on la voyait dix fois en un jour sortir et rentrer, d’un air pressé. D’ailleurs, elle ne s’en tenait pas au commerce des dentelles ; elle utilisait son entresol, elle l’emplissait de quelque solde ramassé on ne savait où. Elle y avait vendu des objets en caoutchouc, manteaux, souliers, bretelles, etc. ; puis on y vit successivement une huile nouvelle pour faire pousser les cheveux, des appareils orthopédiques, une cafetière automatique, invention brevetée, dont l’exploitation lui donna bien du mal. Lorsque son frère vint la voir, elle plaçait des pianos, son entresol était encombré de ces instruments ; il y avait des pianos jusque dans sa chambre à coucher, une chambre très coquettement ornée, et qui jurait avec le pêle-mêle boutiquier des deux autres pièces. Elle tenait ses deux commerces avec une méthode parfaite ; les clients qui venaient pour les marchandises de l’entresol, entraient et sortaient par une porte cochère que la maison avait sur la rue Papillon ; il fallait être dans le mystère du petit escalier pour connaître le trafic en partie double de la marchande de dentelles. À l’entresol, elle se nommait Mme Touche, du nom de son mari, tandis qu’elle n’avait mis que son prénom sur la porte du magasin, ce qui la faisait appeler généralement Mme Sidonie.","Aristide had a sister in Paris. Sidonie Rougon had married a lawyer's clerk from Plassans who had come to try with her, rue Saint-Honoré, the trade in fruits from the South. When her brother found her, the husband had disappeared, and the store had long since been eaten. She lived in the rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, in a small entresol consisting of three rooms. She also rented the shop downstairs, located under her apartment, a narrow and mysterious shop, in which she claimed to hold a lace business; there were indeed, in the window, scraps of guipure and Valencienne, hung on gilt rods; but inside it looked like an antechamber, with gleaming woodwork, without the slightest appearance of merchandise. The door and the window were lined with light curtains which, by sheltering the store from the view of the street, completed giving it the discreet and veiled appearance of a waiting room, opening onto some temple unknown. It was rare for a client to be seen entering Madame Sidonie's; more often than not, the doorknob was removed. In the neighborhood, she repeated that she was going to offer her lace herself to rich women. The furnishing of the apartment alone had made her, she said, rent the shop and the entresol which communicated by a staircase hidden in the wall. In fact, the lace seller was still outside; she was seen ten times in one day going out and returning with a hurried air. Besides, she did not confine herself to the trade in lace; she used her entresol, she filled it with some pay picked up from no one knew where. She had sold rubber objects there, coats, shoes, suspenders, etc. ; then we saw there successively a new oil to make hair grow, orthopedic devices, an automatic coffee maker, a patented invention, the exploitation of which gave him great difficulty. When her brother came to see her, she was placing pianos, her entresol was cluttered with these instruments; there were pianos even in her bedroom, a very stylishly decorated bedroom, which clashed with the jumble of shopkeepers in the other two rooms. She ran her two businesses with perfect method; the customers who came for the goods of the entresol, entered and left by a porte-cochere which the house had on the rue Papillon; you had to be in the mystery of the little staircase to know the double-entry traffic of the lace merchant. On the mezzanine floor, she was called Madame Touche, after her husband's name, while she had only put her first name on the door of the store, which made her generally call Madame Sidonie.","Aristide had a sister in Paris. Sidonie Rougon had married a law clerk from Plassans, whom she had accompanied to the capital to set up a shop on the rue Saint-Honoré selling fruits from the south of France. By the time her brother caught up with her, the husband had vanished, and the shop had long since gone under. She was living in a small three-room apartment above another shop on the rue du Faubourg-Poissonière. She leased the shop as well, a cramped and mysterious boutique in which she pretended to sell lace. And the window did contain pieces of guipure and Valenciennes 6 suspended from gold-plated rods. The interior, however, resembled a waiting room, with gleaming woodwork and no sign of merchandise for sale. Light curtains on the door and window hid the inside of the shop from prying eyes, contributing to the impression that the boutique was actually the discreet and veiled antechamber to a strange temple of some sort. It was rare to see a customer enter Mme Sidonie’s shop. Usually, in fact, the knob was removed from the door. She always told people in the neighborhood that she went personally to the homes of wealthy clients to display her wares. Her only reason for renting the shop, she said, was the layout of the apartment, which communicated with the boutique below via a stairway hidden in the wall. Indeed, the lace merchant was seldom in. She came and went ten times a day, always with a hurried air. In any case, she did not limit herself to selling lace. She used her apartment to store goods picked up Lord knows where. There she sold rubber overshoes, raincoats, suspenders, and countless other items. Later she added to her inventory a new oil said to promote the growth of hair, various orthopedic devices, and an automatic coffeemaker, a patented invention , the commercialization of which gave her a great deal of trouble. When her brother came to see her, she was dealing in pianos, and her apartment was crammed with these instruments. There were pianos even in her bedroom, which was very smartly decorated in a manner that clashed with the commercial jumble of the other two rooms. She ran her two businesses in a perfectly methodical way. Customers who came for the merchandise upstairs entered and exited through the carriage entrance on the rue Papillon. You had to be in on the mystery of the hidden staircase to be aware of the lace merchant’s double life. Upstairs she went by the name of Mme Touche, using her husband’s surname, whereas the door that led to the shop directly from the street bore only her first name, so that most people knew her as Mme Sidonie.","Aristide had a sister in Paris. Sidonie Rougon had married a solicitor’s clerk in Plassans, and together they had set up business in the Rue Saint-Honoré as dealers in fruit from the south of France. When her brother came across her, the husband had vanished and the business had long since disappeared. She was living in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière, in a little entresol consisting of three rooms. She also leased the shop on the floor beneath her apartment, a cramped and mysterious establishment in which she pretended to carry on a business in lace. In the window there were some odds and ends of point lace and Valenciennes, hung over gilt rods; but the inside looked like a waiting room, with polished wood panelling and not the least sign of goods for sale. The door and window were hung with light curtains, which protected the shop from the gaze of passers-by and heightened its discreet appearance, as of the atrium to some unknown temple. It was a rare thing for a customer to be seen calling on Madame Sidonie; usually, in fact, the handle was removed from the door. She made it known in the neighbourhood that she waited personally upon wealthy women with her lace. The convenience of the place, she used to say, was her sole reason for leasing the shop and the entresol, which were connected by a staircase hidden in the wall. In fact the lace-dealer was never at home; she was seen hurrying in and out at least ten times a day. Moreover, she did not confine herself to the lace trade; she used her entresol to store various things picked up nobody knew where. She had waterproofs, galoshes, braces, and so on; and then, one after the other, a new oil for restoring hair, orthopaedic appliances, and a patented automatic coffee-pot, the working of which had cost her a great deal of trouble. When her brother called to see her she was selling pianos; her entresol was crammed with these instruments; there were pianos even in her bedroom, a coquettishly furnished room that clashed with the saleroom disorder of the other two. She conducted these two businesses with perfect method: the customers who came for the goods on the entresol entered and left through a carriage-entrance that led into the house from the Rue Papillon; you had to know the secret of the little staircase to be aware of the twofold nature of the lace-woman’s dealings. On the entresol she called herself Madame Touche, her husband’s name, while on the shop door she had put only her first name, which meant that she was generally known as Madame Sidonie."

"Aimant la procédure, oubliant ses affaires pour celles des autres, elle se laissait dévorer par les huissiers, ce qui, d’ailleurs, lui procurait des jouissances que connaissent seuls les gens processifs.

"Il n’était pas encore minuit. En bas, sur le boulevard, Paris grondait, prolongeait la journée ardente, avant de se décider à gagner son lit. Les files d’arbres marquaient, d’une ligne confuse, les blancheurs des trottoirs et le noir vague de la chaussée, où passaient le roulement et les lanternes rapides des voitures. Aux deux bords de cette bande obscure, les kiosques des marchands de journaux, de place en place, s’allumaient, pareils à de grandes lanternes vénitiennes, hautes et bizarrement bariolées, posées régulièrement à terre, pour quelque illumination colossale. Mais, à cette heure, leur éclat assourdi se perdait dans le flamboiement des devantures voisines. Pas un volet n’était mis, les trottoirs s’allongeaient sans une raie d’ombre, sous une pluie de rayons qui les éclairait d’une poussière d’or, de la clarté chaude et éclatante du plein jour. Maxime montra à Renée, en face d’eux, le café Anglais, dont les fenêtres luisaient. Les branches hautes des arbres les gênaient un peu, d’ailleurs, pour voir les maisons et le trottoir opposés. Ils se penchèrent, ils regardèrent au-dessous d’eux. C’était un va-et-vient continu ; des promeneurs passaient par groupes, des filles, deux à deux, traînaient leurs jupes, qu’elles relevaient de temps à autre, d’un mouvement alangui, en jetant autour d’elles des regards las et souriants. Sous la fenêtre même, le café Riche avançait ses tables dans le coup de soleil de ses lustres, dont l’éclat s’étendait jusqu’au milieu de la chaussée ; et c’était surtout au centre de cet ardent foyer qu’ils voyaient les faces blêmes et les rires pâles des passants. Autour des petites tables rondes, des femmes, mêlées aux hommes, buvaient. Elles étaient en robes voyantes, les cheveux dans le cou ; elles se dandinaient sur les chaises, avec des paroles hautes que le bruit empêchait d’entendre. Renée en remarqua particulièrement une, seule à une table, vêtue d’un costume d’un bleu dur, garni d’une guipure blanche ; elle achevait, à petits coups, un verre de bière, renversée à demi, les mains sur le ventre, d’un air d’attente lourde et résignée. Celles qui marchaient se perdaient lentement au milieu de la foule, et la jeune femme, qu’elles intéressaient, les suivait du regard, allait d’un bout du boulevard à l’autre, dans les lointains tumultueux et confus de l’avenue, pleins du grouillement noir des promeneurs, et où les clartés n’étaient plus que des étincelles. Et le défilé repassait sans fin, avec une régularité fatigante, monde étrangement mêlé et toujours le même, au milieu des couleurs vives, des trous de ténèbres, dans le tohu-bohu féerique de ces mille flammes dansantes, sortant comme un flot des boutiques, colorant les transparents des croisées et des kiosques, courant sur les façades en baguettes, en lettres, en dessins de feu, piquant l’ombre d’étoiles, filant sur la chaussée, continuellement. Le bruit assourdissant qui montait avait une clameur, un ronflement prolongé, monotone, comme une note d’orgue accompagnant l’éternelle procession de petites poupées mécaniques. Renée crut, un moment, qu’un accident venait d’avoir lieu. Un flot de personnes se mouvait à gauche, un peu au-delà du passage de l’Opéra. Mais, ayant pris son binocle, elle reconnut le bureau des omnibus[32] ; il y avait beaucoup de monde sur le trottoir, debout, attendant, se précipitant, dès qu’une voiture arrivait. Elle entendait la voix rude du contrôleur appeler les numéros, puis les tintements du compteur lui arrivaient en sonneries cristallines. Elle s’arrêta aux annonces d’un kiosque, crûment coloriées comme les images d’Épinal ; il y avait, sur un carreau, dans un cadre jaune et vert, une tête de diable ricanant, les cheveux hérissés, réclame d’un chapelier qu’elle ne comprit pas. De cinq minutes en cinq minutes, l’omnibus des Batignolles passait, avec ses lanternes rouges et sa caisse jaune, tournant le coin de la rue Le Peletier, ébranlant la maison de son fracas ; et elle voyait les hommes de l’impériale, des visages fatigués qui se levaient et les regardaient, elle et Maxime, du regard curieux des affamés mettant l’œil à une serrure.","It was not yet midnight. Below, on the boulevard, Paris rumbled, prolonging the ardent day, before deciding to go to bed. The rows of trees marked out in a confused line the whiteness of the sidewalks and the vague blackness of the roadway, through which passed the rumbling and the rapid lanterns of the cars. On both sides of this dark band, the kiosks of the newsagents, from place to place, were lighted up, like great Venetian lanterns, tall and oddly variegated, placed regularly on the ground, for some colossal illumination. But, at this hour, their muted brilliance was lost in the blaze of the neighboring storefronts. Not a shutter had been put up, the sidewalks stretched out without a streak of shadow, under a rain of rays which lit them up with a golden dust, with the warm and dazzling light of broad daylight. Maxime showed Renée, opposite them, the Cafe Anglais, whose windows gleamed. The high branches of the trees made it a little difficult for them to see the houses and the opposite sidewalk. They bent down, they looked below them. It was a continuous back and forth; strollers passed by in groups, girls, two by two, dragged their skirts, which they lifted from time to time with a languid movement, casting around them weary and smiling glances. Beneath the window itself, the Café Riche displayed its tables in the sunshine of its chandeliers, the brilliance of which extended to the middle of the street; and it was above all in the center of this ardent hearth that they saw the pale faces and the pale laughter of the passers-by. Around the small round tables, women, mingled with men, were drinking. They were in showy dresses, their hair down their necks; they waddled on the chairs, with loud words that the noise prevented from hearing. Renée noticed one in particular, alone at a table, dressed in a hard blue suit trimmed with white lace; she was finishing off a glass of beer, half overturned, her hands on her stomach, with an air of heavy and resigned expectation. Those who walked were slowly lost in the middle of the crowd, and the young woman, whom they interested, followed them with her eyes, went from one end of the boulevard to the other, in the tumultuous and confused distances of the avenue, full of the black swarming of walkers, and where the lights were no more than sparks. And the procession passed endlessly, with a tiring regularity, a world strangely mixed and always the same, in the midst of bright colors, holes of darkness, in the enchanting hustle and bustle of these thousand dancing flames, flowing like a flood from the shops, coloring the transparencies of the windows and kiosks, running on the facades in strips, in letters, in patterns of fire, pricking the shadow of stars, spinning on the roadway, continuously. The deafening noise that rose had a clamor, a prolonged, monotonous hum, like an organ note accompanying the eternal procession of little mechanical dolls. Renée thought for a moment that an accident had just taken place. A stream of people was moving to the left, a little beyond the Passage de l'Opéra. But, having taken her binoculars, she recognized the office of the omnibuses[32]; there were many people on the sidewalk, standing, waiting, rushing, as soon as a car arrived. She heard the conductor's rough voice call out the numbers, then the ringing of the speedometer came to her in crystalline ringtones. She stopped at the announcements of a kiosk, crudely colored like the pictures of Epinal; there was, on a windowpane, in a yellow and green frame, the head of a sneering devil, his hair standing on end, an advertisement from a hatter which she did not understand. Every five minutes the Batignolles omnibus passed, with its red lanterns and its yellow body, turning the corner of the Rue Le Peletier, shaking the house with its crash; and she saw the men from the deck, tired faces rising and looking at her and Maxime with the curious gaze of the starving staring at a lock.","It was not yet midnight. Down below, on the boulevard, Paris went rumbling on, prolonging the blaze of daylight before making up its mind to turn in for the night. Wavering lines of trees separated the whiteness of the sidewalks from the murky blackness of the roadway with its thunder of speeding carriages and flash of headlights. At intervals on either side of this dark strip newsdealers’ kiosks blazed forth like huge Venetian lanterns, tall and strangely gaudy, as if they had been set down in these precise places for some colossal illumination. At this time of night, however, their muffled glow was lost in the glare of nearby storefronts. Not a single shutter was down, and the sidewalks ran on without a patch of shadow, under a shower of light that sprinkled them with golden dust, as warm and bright as the midday sun. Maxime pointed out to Renée the bright windows of the Café Anglais opposite them. The high branches of the trees interfered somewhat with their view of the buildings and sidewalk across the way. They leaned out to get a better view of what lay below. A steady stream of traffic flowed past. Groups of people walked by; prostitutes, strolling in pairs, dragged their skirts along the sidewalk, lifting them from time to time in a languid motion while casting weary, smiling glances from side to side. Directly below the window, the tables of the Café Riche basked in the glare of its lamps, whose light reached to the middle of the roadway. It was in the center of the restaurant’s glow that they could best see the pale faces and hear the wan laughter of the passersby. Around the small round tables, women mingled with the men and drank. They wore revealing dresses, and their hair cascaded down upon their necks. They shimmied in their chairs and spoke in loud voices that Renée could not make out above the noise. She took particular notice of one, sitting alone at a table in a loud blue outfit trimmed with white lace. With little sips this woman finished off a glass of beer, then leaned back a bit and placed her hands over her belly with an air of gloomy resignation. The streetwalkers slowly vanished into the crowd, and Renée, who found them fascinating, followed them with her eyes, scanning from one end of the boulevard to the other all the way to the tumultuous bustle of the avenue, filled with people strolling in darkness occasionally relieved by flashes of light. The parade was endless, moreover, renewing itself with tiresome regularity; it was a strangely mixed crowd, yet always the same, surrounded by bright colors and punctuated by dark voids in the fantastic chaos of a thousand dancing flames pouring from the shops, coloring the storefronts and kiosks, painting the façades with fiery ribbons, letters, and designs, studding the shadows with stars, and washing constantly over the roadway. The noise was deafening, a howl, a monotonous, steady hum that rose from the streets like the whine of an organ accompanying an endless procession of little mechanical dolls. At one point Renée thought there had been an accident. The crowd surged to the left just beyond the Passage de l’Opéra. When she took up her spectacles, however, she recognized the omnibus office. The crowd waiting on the sidewalk pressed forward whenever a bus arrived. She heard the gruff voice of the conductor calling out numbers, and then the crystalline tinkle of the bell. Her eyes lingered over the posters plastered to one of the kiosks, as gaudily colored as an Epinal print.2 One green-and-yellow frame featured a poster under glass depicting a grinning devil’s head with bristling hair, an ad for a hat-maker, which she failed to comprehend. Every five minutes the Batignolles omnibus passed with its red lights and yellow sides, turning the corner from the rue le Peletier and shaking the building with its rumble, and she saw the men on the upper deck look up with their tired faces, staring at her and Maxime with the curious gaze of famished men peering through a keyhole.","It was not yet midnight. On the boulevard below, Paris was still noisy, prolonging the day’s activity before deciding to go to bed. The rows of trees separated the whiteness of the pavement from the darkness of the roadway, on which the carriages rumbled along with their fleeting lamps. On both edges of this dark belt the newsvendors’ kiosks shed their light from spot to spot, like great Venetian lanterns, tall and fantastically variegated, set on the ground at regular intervals for some colossal illumination. But at this late hour their usually bright light was subdued and lost in the flare of the shop-fronts. Not a shutter was up, the pavement stretched out without a line of shadow, under a shower of rays that covered it with a golden dust, with the warm, resplendent glare of daylight. Maxime showed Renée the Café Anglais, whose windows shone out in front of them. The lofty branches of the trees blocked their view a little when they tried to see the houses and pavement opposite. They leant over and looked down at the street. There was a continual coming and going; men walked past in groups, prostitutes in pairs dragged their skirts, which they lifted up from time to time with a languid movement, casting weary, smiling glances around them. Right under the window, the tables of the Café Riche were spread out in the blaze of the gas lamps, whose brilliancy extended half across the roadway; and it was especially in the centre of this blaze that they saw the pale faces and empty smiles of the passers-by. Around the little tables were men and women mingled together, drinking. The girls wore showy dresses, their hair dressed low on their necks; they lounged about on chairs and made loud remarks, which the noise made inaudible. Renée noticed one in particular, sitting alone at a table, wearing a bright blue costume with white lace; leaning back in her chair, she finished, sip by sip, a glass of beer, her hands on her stomach, a heavy and resigned look of expectancy on her face. The women on foot disappeared slowly in the crowd, and Renée, intrigued, watched them go, gazing from one end of the boulevard to the other. The endless procession, a crowd strangely mixed and always alike, passed by with tiring regularity in the midst of the bright colours and patches of darkness, in the fairy-like confusion of the thousand leaping flames that swept like waves from the shops, lending colour to the windows and the kiosks, running along the pavements in fillets, in fiery letters and designs, piercing the darkness with stars, gliding endlessly along the roadway. The deafening noise had a roar, a prolonged monotonous rumbling, like an organ-note accompanying an endless procession of little mechanical dolls. Renée at one moment thought there had been an accident. There was a stream of people on the left, just beyond the Passage de l’Opéra. * But, taking her eyeglass, she recognized the omnibus office. A crowd had gathered on the pavement, waiting, and rushing forward as soon as an omnibus arrived. She heard the rough voice of the ticket collector calling out the numbers, followed by the tinkle of the bell. Her eyes lighted upon the advertisements on a kiosk, garishly coloured like Épinal prints; * on a pane of glass, in a green-and-yellow frame, was the head of a grinning devil with hair on end, a hatter’s advertisement, which she could not understand. Every five minutes the Batignolles omnibus passed by, with its red lamps and yellow sides, turning the corner of the Rue Le Peletier, shaking the building as it went, and she saw the men on the upper deck look up at them with their tired faces, with the expectant look of famished people peering through a keyhole."
"Il fut supérieur dans toute cette affaire. Il poussa la prudence jusqu’à ne pas rendre le baron Gouraud et M. Toutin-Laroche complices l’un de l’autre. Il les visita séparément, leur glissa un mot à l’oreille en faveur d’un de ses amis qui allait être exproprié, rue de la Pépinière ; il eut bien soin de dire à chacun des deux compères qu’il ne parlerait de cette affaire à aucun autre membre de la commission, que c’était une chose en l’air, mais qu’il comptait sur toute sa bienveillance.","He was superior in all this business. He was cautious enough not to make Baron Gouraud and M. Toutin-Laroche accomplices to each other.

"Maxime parlait d’amis à recevoir qu’il n’osait faire venir chez son père. Ce fut dans l’entresol de la rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière qu’il passa plusieurs nuits avec cette pauvre fille qu’on dut envoyer à la campagne.

It was in his aunt’s apartment above the shop on the rue du Faubourg-Poissonière that he had spent several nights with the poor girl who had had to be sent away to the country. Mme Sidonie borrowed money from her nephew and swooned at the sight of him, whispering sweetly in his ear that he was “as smooth and pink as a cherub.”","Maxime talked of some friends he wanted to entertain, and whom he dared not ask to his father’s house.
