"Il n’avait rien, que sa très chétive demi-solde de chef d’escadron. Il avait loué à Vernon la plus petite maison qu’il avait pu trouver. Il y vivait seul, on vient de voir comment.

"Enjolras, tout en cheminant vers ce lieu de rendez-vous, passait en lui-même la revue de la situation. La gravité des événements était visible. Quand les faits, prodromes d’une espèce de maladie sociale latente, se meuvent lourdement, la moindre complication les arrête et les enchevêtre. Phénomène d’où sortent les écroulements et les renaissances. Enjolras entrevoyait un soulèvement lumineux sous les pans ténébreux de l’avenir. Qui sait ? le moment approchait peut-être. Le peuple ressaisissant le droit, quel beau spectacle ! la révolution reprenant majestueusement possession de la France, et disant au monde : La suite à demain ! Enjolras était content. La fournaise chauffait. Il avait, dans ce même instant-là, une traînée de poudre d’amis éparse sur Paris. Il composait, dans sa pensée, avec l’éloquence philosophique et pénétrante de Combeferre, l’enthousiasme cosmopolite de Feuilly, la verve de Courfeyrac, le rire de Bahorel, la mélancolie de Jean Prouvaire, la science de Joly, les sarcasmes de Bossuet, une sorte de pétillement électrique prenant feu à la fois un peu partout. Tous à l’œuvre. A coup sûr le résultat répondrait à l’effort. C’était bien. Ceci le fit penser à Grantaire. ― Tiens, se dit-il, la barrière du Maine me détourne à peine de mon chemin. Si je poussais jusque chez Richefeu ? Voyons un peu ce que fait Grantaire, et où il en est.","Enjolras, while walking towards this place of rendezvous, reviewed the situation within himself. The gravity of the events was visible. When the facts, prodromes of a kind of latent social disease, move heavily, the slightest complication stops them and entangles them. Phenomenon from which come collapses and rebirths. Enjolras foresaw a luminous uprising beneath the shadows of the future. Who knows ? the time was perhaps approaching. The people recapturing the law, what a beautiful sight! the revolution majestically resuming possession of France, and saying to the world: The sequel to tomorrow! Enjolras was happy. The furnace was heating. He had, at that very moment, a trail of friends scattered over Paris. He composed, in his thought, with the philosophical and penetrating eloquence of Combeferre, the cosmopolitan enthusiasm of Feuilly, the verve of Courfeyrac, the laughter of Bahorel, the melancholy of Jean Prouvaire, the science of Joly, the sarcasms of Bossuet, a kind of electric crackle catching fire all over the place. All at work. Surely the result would respond to the effort. It was good. This made him think of Grantaire. “Hold on,” he said to himself, “the Maine barrier barely deflects me from my path. If I pushed as far as Richefeu? Let's take a look at what Grantaire is doing, and where he is.","As Enjolras headed towards this meeting-place he reviewed the whole situation. The gravity of the circumstances was obvious. When events symptomatic of a kind of latent social disease move sluggishly, the slightest complication arrests and obstructs them.

The people reasserting their right – what a glorious spectacle! The Revolution was majestically taking hold of France once again and saying to the world, ‘The story continues!’ Enjolras was pleased. Things were hotting up. He had at that very moment a powder trail of friends scattered all over Paris. With Combeferre’s shrewd and philosophical eloquence, Feuilly’s cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s wit, Bahorel’s mirth, Jean Prouvaire’s melancholy, Joly’s erudition, Bossuet’s sarcasm, he mentally orchestrated a kind of explosion of electric sparks that set alight almost everywhere at once. Everyone doing his bit! The result would surely repay the effort. It was going well. This made him think of Grantaire. ‘Well now,’ said he to himself, ‘the Maine toll-gate doesn’t take me far out of my way. Why not go on to Richefeu’s? Just to see what Grantaire’s doing, and how he’s getting on.’","As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at hand. The people were again taking possession of right, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking possession of France and saying to the world: “The sequel to-morrow!” Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his own mind, with Combeferre’s philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuilly’s cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s dash, Bahorel’s smile, Jean Prouvaire’s melancholy, Joly’s science, Bossuet’s sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort. This was well. This made him think of Grantaire. “Hold,” said he to himself, “the Barrière du Maine will not take me far out of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu’s? Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on.”","Enjolras, on his way towards this place of rendezvous, passed the situation in review. The gravity of events was plainly visible. When events, premonitory of some latent social malady, are moving heavily along, the least complication stops them and shackles them.

The people seizing their rights again, what a beautiful spectacle! the Revolution majestically resuming possession of France, and saying to the world: to be continued to-morrow! Enjolras was content.

"L’enfant, qui s’appelait Marius, savait qu’il avait un père, mais rien de plus. Personne ne lui en ouvrait la bouche. Cependant, dans le monde où son grand-père le menait, les chuchotements, les demi-mots, les clins d’yeux, s’étaient fait jour à la longue jusque dans l’esprit du petit, il avait fini par comprendre quelque chose, et comme il prenait naturellement, par une sorte d’infiltration et de pénétration lente, les idées et les opinions qui étaient, pour ainsi dire, son milieu respirable, il en vint peu à peu à ne songer à son père qu’avec honte et le cœur serré.","The child, who was called Marius, knew he had a father, but nothing more.

"Ainsi, déjeuner quatre sous, dîner seize sous ; sa nourriture lui coûtait vingt sous par jour ; ce qui faisait trois cent soixante-cinq francs par an.

"Marius achevait à peine de lui faire cette scène avec les yeux que quelqu’un traversa l’allée. C’était un invalide tout courbé, tout ridé et tout blanc, en uniforme Louis XV, ayant sur le torse la petite plaque ovale de drap rouge aux épées croisées, croix de Saint-Louis du soldat, et orné en outre d’une manche d’habit sans bras dedans, d’un menton d’argent et d’une jambe de bois. Marius crut distinguer que cet être avait l’air extrêmement satisfait. Il lui sembla même que le vieux cynique, tout en clopinant près de lui, lui avait adressé un clignement d’œil très fraternel et très joyeux, comme si un hasard quelconque avait fait qu’ils pussent être d’intelligence et qu’ils eussent savouré en commun quelque bonne aubaine. Qu’avait-il donc à être si content, ce débris de Mars ? Que s’était-il donc passé entre cette jambe de bois et l’autre ? Marius arriva au paroxysme de la jalousie. ― Il était peut-être là ! se dit-il ; il a peut-être vu ! — Et il eut envie d’exterminer l’invalide.","Marius had hardly finished performing this scene with his eyes when someone crossed the aisle. He was an invalid all bent, all wrinkled and all white, in Louis XV uniform, having on his chest the small oval plate of red cloth with crossed swords, the soldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned in addition with a sleeve coat without arms in it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he could make out that this being looked extremely satisfied. It even seemed to him that the old cynic, while hobbling beside him, had given him a very fraternal and very joyful wink, as if some chance had caused them to be of intelligence and that they had savored some good bargain together. What had he to be so happy about, this remnant of Mars? What had happened between this wooden leg and the other? Marius reached the paroxysm of jealousy. “Maybe he was there! he says to him ; he may have seen! ""And he wanted to exterminate the invalid.""","Marius had scarcely finished this quarrel with her, conducted through glances, when someone came along the path. This was a very stooped, very wrinkled, very white-haired war veteran in a uniform dating back to Louis XV, the little oval of red cloth with crossed swords on his chest, the ordinary soldier’s St Louis cross; and further decorated with an armless coat-sleeve, a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he discerned in this individual an air of great contentment. He even thought the old cynic hobbling by had given him a very brotherly and very cheerful wink, as if some chance occurrence had created an understanding between them and they had enjoyed some shared stroke of luck. Well, what made him so happy, war-ravaged wreck that he was? What were the goings-on between this wooden leg and that other leg? Marius’s jealousy reached its peak. ‘Perhaps he was there!’ he said to himself. ‘Perhaps he saw!’ And he felt like killing the veteran.","Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one crossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier’s cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that relic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between that wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy.—“Perhaps he was there!” he said to himself; “perhaps he saw!”—And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.","Marius had hardly finished this scene with her when somebody came down the walk. It was an Invalide, very much bent, wrinkled and pale with age, in the uniform of Louis XV., with the little oval patch of red cloth with crossed swords on his back, the soldier’s Cross of Saint Louis, and decorated also by a coat sleeve in which there was no arm, a silver chin, and a wooden leg. Marius thought he could discern that this man appeared to be very much pleased. It seemed to him even that the old cynic, as he hobbled along by him, had addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as if by some chance they had been put into communication and had enjoyed some dainty bit of good fortune together. What had he seen to be so pleased, this relic of Mars? What had happened between this leg of wood and the other? Marius had a paroxysm of jealousy. “Perhaps he was by!” said he; “perhaps he saw!” And he would have been glad to exterminate the Invalide."

"Il y avait pourtant dans toute l’immense création deux femmes que Marius ne fuyait pas et auxquelles il ne prenait point garde. A la vérité on l’eût fort étonné si on lui eût dit que c’étaient des femmes. L’une était la vieille barbue qui balayait sa chambre et qui faisait dire à Courfeyrac : Voyant que sa servante porte sa barbe, Marius ne porte point la sienne. L’autre était une espèce de petite fille qu’il voyait très souvent et qu’il ne regardait jamais.","There were, however, in all the immense creation two women whom Marius did not flee and to whom he paid no heed. In truth, he would have been very surprised if he had been told that they were women. One was the old bearded woman who swept her room and made Courfeyrac say: Seeing that her servant wears her beard, Marius does not wear his. The other was a kind of little girl he saw very often and never looked at.","Yet in all the boundlessness of creation there were two women Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatsoever. To tell the truth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been told they were women. One was the bearded crone who swept his room and of whom Courfeyrac used to say, ‘Seeing as his serving-woman has a beard, Marius doesn’t have one.’ The other was a little girl he saw very often and never looked at.","Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women whom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In truth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: “Seeing that his servant woman wears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard.” The other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.","There were, however, in all the immensity of creation, two women from whom Marius never fled, and whom he did not at all avoid. Indeed he would have been very much astonished had anybody told him that they were women.

"Marius n’en pouvait douter, c’était bien d’elle qu’on parlait. Il écoutait avec une anxiété ardente.

"Le propre du droit, c’est de rester éternellement beau et pur. Le fait, même le plus nécessaire en apparence, même le mieux accepté des contemporains, s’il n’existe que comme fait et s’il ne contient que trop peu de droit ou point du tout de droit, est destiné infailliblement à devenir, avec la durée du temps, difforme, immonde, peut-être même monstrueux. Si l’on veut constater d’un coup à quel degré de laideur le fait peut arriver, vu à la distance des siècles, qu’on regarde Machiavel. Machiavel, ce n’est point un mauvais génie, ni un démon, ni un écrivain lâche et misérable ; ce n’est rien que le fait. Et ce n’est pas seulement le fait italien, c’est le fait européen, le fait du seizième siècle. Il semble hideux, et il l’est, en présence de l’idée morale du dix-neuvième.","The essence of law is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The fact, even the most necessary in appearance, even the best accepted by contemporaries, if it exists only as a fact and if it contains only too little right or no right at all, is destined infallibly to become, over time, deformed, filthy, perhaps even monstrous. If we want to see at once to what degree of ugliness the fact can reach, seen from the distance of centuries, we have to look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a cowardly and miserable writer; it is nothing but the fact. And it is not only the Italian fact, it is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. It looks hideous, and it is, in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.","Characteristic of what is right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. Reality, even the most apparently inexorable, even the best-accepted by its contemporaries, if it exists only as reality and contains but too little right or none at all, is surely destined to become in the course of time distorted, squalid, perhaps even monstrous. Anyone wanting to take in at a glance how ugly reality can be, seen from a distance centuries later, should consider Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, or a demon, or a wretched and cowardly writer. He is simply the reality. And he is not just the Italian reality. He is the European reality, the reality of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, when confronted with the nineteenth-century moral conception.","The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and if it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly destined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps, even monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries, let him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact. And he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.","The peculiarity of the right is that it is always beautiful and pure. The fact, even that which is most necessary in appearance, even that most accepted by its contemporaries, if it exist only as fact, and if it contain too little of the right, or none at all, is destined infallibly to become, in the lapse of time, deformed, unclean, perhaps even monstrous.

"Soit dit en passant, ces abandons d’enfants n’étaient point découragés par l’ancienne monarchie.

Well, the stray child is the inevitable consequence of the uneducated child.","Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of the powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma.

Cependant les sergents de ville veillent, et il en résulte une situation hautement dramatique qui a donné lieu une fois à un cri fraternel et mémorable ; ce cri, qui fut célèbre vers 1830, est un avertissement stratégique de gamin à gamin ; il se scande comme un vers d’Homère, avec une notation presque aussi inexprimable que la mélopée éleusiaque des Panathénées, et l’on y retrouve l’antique Évohé.

However, the police are on the lookout, and the result is a highly dramatic situation that once gave rise to a memorable fraternal cry.

However, the policemen are on the look-out, and there results from this circumstance a highly dramatic situation which, upon one occasion, gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry.

"Ici Jondrette crut évidemment le moment venu de s’emparer du « philanthrope ».

Fortune once smiled upon me. Alas! now it is the turn of misfortune. See, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor kids have no fire! My only stripped chair! A broken tile! by the weather! My wife in bed! sick !","At this point Jondrette evidently thought the moment had come to exert his influence over the ‘philanthropist’. He cried out in a tone that at one and the same time had the ring of the charlatan’s fairground patter and the humbleness of the mendicant who plies the highways. ‘A pupil of Talma, monsieur! I’m a pupil of Talma! Fortune once smiled on me. Alas! It’s now the turn of misfortune. You see, my charitable friend, no bread, no fire. My poor babes without a fire! My only chair in need of repair! A broken window-pane! In weather like this! My wife in bed! Sick!’","Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the “philanthropist.” He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of the mendicant on the highway:— “A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled on me—Alas! Now it is misfortune’s turn. You see, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat! A broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!”","Here Jondrette evidently thought the moment come to make an impression upon the “philanthropist.” He exclaimed in a tone of voice which belongs to the braggadocio of the juggler at a fair, and, at the same time, to the humility of a beggar on the highway: “Pupil of Talma! Monsieur! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune once smiled on me. Alas! now it is the turn of misfortune. Look, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor darlings have no fire! My only chair unseated! A broken window! in such weather as is this! My spouse in bed! sick!”"

"Marius à son tour baissa la tête. Ce mot simple et froid avait traversé comme une lame d’acier son effusion épique, et il la sentait s’évanouir en lui. Lorsqu’il leva les yeux, Combeferre n’était plus là. Satisfait probablement de sa réplique à l’apothéose, il venait de partir, et tous, excepté Enjolras, l’avaient suivi. La salle s’était vidée. Enjolras, resté seul avec Marius, le regardait gravement. Marius, cependant, ayant un peu rallié ses idées, ne se tenait pas pour battu ; il y avait en lui un reste de bouillonnement qui allait sans doute se traduire en syllogismes déployés contre Enjolras, quand tout à coup on entendit quelqu’un qui chantait dans l’escalier en s’en allant. C’était Combeferre, et voici ce qu’il chantait :","Marius in his turn lowered his head.

Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had just left, and all, except Enjolras, had followed him. The room had emptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, looked at him gravely. Marius, however, having somewhat rallied his ideas, did not consider himself beaten; there was in him a remnant of ferment which was no doubt to be expressed in syllogisms deployed against Enjolras, when suddenly someone was heard singing on the stairs as they left. It was Combeferre, and this is what he was singing:","Marius in turn bowed his head.

Left alone with Marius, Enjolras gazed at him solemnly. Marius, however, having somewhat rallied his thoughts, was not ready to admit defeat.

"― C’est justement cela qui ne m’embarrasse pas, s’écria Fauchelevent. Si vous êtes sûr de vous tirer de la bière, moi je suis sûr de vous tirer de la fosse. Le fossoyeur est un ivrogne de mes amis. C’est le père Mestienne. Un vieux de la vieille vigne. Le fossoyeur met les morts dans la fosse, et moi je mets le fossoyeur dans ma poche. Ce qui se passera je vais vous le dire. On arrivera un peu avant la brune, trois quarts d’heure avant la fermeture des grilles du cimetière. Le corbillard roulera jusqu’à la fosse. Je suivrai ; c’est ma besogne. J’aurai un marteau, un ciseau et des tenailles dans ma poche. Le corbillard s’arrête, les croque-morts vous nouent une corde autour de votre bière et vous descendent. Le prêtre dit les prières, fait le signe de croix, jette l’eau bénite, et file. Je reste seul avec le père Mestienne. C’est mon ami, je vous dis. De deux choses l’une, ou il sera soûl, ou il ne sera pas soûl. S’il n’est pas soûl, je lui dis : Viens boire un coup pendant que le Bon Coing est encore ouvert. Je l’emmène, je le grise, le père Mestienne n’est pas long à griser, il est toujours commencé, je te le couche sous la table, je lui prends sa carte pour rentrer au cimetière, et je reviens sans lui. Vous n’avez plus affaire qu’à moi. S’il est soûl, je lui dis : Va-t’en, je vais faire ta besogne. Il s’en va, et je vous tire du trou.","“That is precisely what does not embarrass me,” cried Fauchelevent. If you're sure to get you out of the beer, I'm sure to get you out of the pit. The gravedigger is a drunkard friend of mine. It is Father Messienne. An old man from the old vine. The gravedigger puts the dead in the pit, and I put the gravedigger in my pocket. What will happen I will tell you. We will arrive a little before dusk, three quarters of an hour before the cemetery gates close. The hearse will roll to the pit. I will follow ; it is my business. I'll have a hammer, chisel, and pliers in my pocket. The hearse stops, the undertakers tie a rope around your beer and take you down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, throws the holy water, and leaves. I remain alone with Father Mestienne. He's my friend, I tell you. One of two things, either he will be drunk or he will not be drunk. If he's not drunk, I tell him: Come and have a drink while the Bon Coing is still open. I take him away, I get him drunk, Father Mestienne doesn't take long to get drunk, he's still started, I put him under the table for you, I take his card to go back to the cemetery, and I come back without him. You only have to deal with me. If he is drunk, I tell him: Go away, I will do your job. He leaves, and I pull you out of the hole.","‘That’s the very thing that doesn’t bother me,’ exclaimed Fauchelevent. ‘If you’re confident of getting through the experience of being in the coffin, I’m confident of getting you out of the grave. The gravedigger’s a drunkard friend of mine. Père Mestienne. A veteran old soak. The gravedigger disposes of the dead, and I dispose of the gravedigger. I’ll tell you what will happen. We’ll get there shortly before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the cemetery gates close. The hearse will drive directly up to the grave. I’ll be following behind. That’s my job. I’ll have a hammer, a chisel and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse stops, the coffin bearers tie a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The priest says some prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles holy water, and he’s off. I’m left alone with Père Mestienne. He’s my friend, I tell you. There are two possibilities, he’s either drunk or he’s not. If he’s not drunk, I say to him, “Come and have a drink while the Bon Coing’s still open.” I take him away , I get him drunk – it doesn’t take long to get Père Mestienne drunk, he’s always had a head start – I drink him under the table, I take his pass to get back into the cemetery and I return without him. Then you’ll just be dealing with me. If he’s drunk I say to him, “Go away, I’ll do your work for you.” Off he goes and I pull you out of the hole.’","“That is the very point that is not troublesome,” exclaimed Fauchelevent. “If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard, and a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. They will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive directly up to the grave.

The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: ‘Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing [the Good Quince] is open.’ I carry him off, I get him drunk,—it does not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it about him,—I lay him under the table , I take his card, so that I can get into the cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: ‘Be off; I will do your work for you.’ Off he goes, and I drag you out of the hole.”","“That is just what does not embarrass me,” exclaimed Fauchelevent. “If you are sure of getting yourself out of the coffin, I am sure of getting you out of the grave.

I get him away , I fuddle him; Father Mestienne is not long in getting fuddled, he is always half way. I lay him under the table, I take his card from him to return to the cemetery with! and I come back without him. You will have only me to deal with. If he is drunk, I say to him: be off. I’ll do your work. He goes away, and I pull you out of the hole.”"
"Ce qui accroissait la souffrance secrète du père Gillenormand, c’est qu’il la renfermait tout entière et n’en laissait rien deviner. Son chagrin était comme ces fournaises nouvellement inventées qui brûlent leur fumée. Quelquefois, il arrivait que des officieux malencontreux lui parlaient de Marius, et lui demandaient : ― Que fait ou que devient monsieur votre petit-fils ? — Le vieux bourgeois répondait, en soupirant, s’il était trop triste, ou en donnant une chiquenaude à sa manchette, s’il voulait paraître gai : ― Monsieur le baron Pontmercy plaidaille dans quelque coin.","What increased Father Gillenormand's secret suffering was that he contained it entirely and left nothing to be guessed at.

"En attendant, bien qu’il fût avocat et quoi qu’en pensât le père Gillenormand, il ne plaidait pas, il ne plaidaillait même pas. La rêverie l’avait détourné de la plaidoirie. Hanter les avoués, suivre le palais, chercher des causes, ennui. Pourquoi faire ? Il ne voyait aucune raison pour changer de gagne-pain.

"De là vient que, dans le livre précédent, j’ai parlé d’un couvent avec un accent respectueux.

Là où il y a la communauté, il y a la commune ; là où il y a la commune, il y a le droit. Le monastère est le produit de la formule : Égalité, Fraternité.

Wherever there is community, there is commonality. Where there is commonality, there is legitimacy. The monastery is a product of the formula: Equality, Fraternity.

Where community exists, there likewise exists the true body politic, and where the latter is, there too is justice. The monastery is the product of the formula: “Equality, Fraternity.” Oh! how great is liberty! And how glorious the transfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic!"

"Arrivé au Luxembourg, Marius fit le tour du bassin et considéra les cygnes, puis il demeura longtemps en contemplation devant une statue qui avait la tête toute noire de moisissure et à laquelle une hanche manquait. Il y avait près du bassin un bourgeois quadragénaire et ventru qui tenait par la main un petit garçon de cinq ans et lui disait : ― Évite les excès. Mon fils, tiens-toi à égale distance du despotisme et de l’anarchie. — Marius écouta ce bourgeois. Puis il fit encore une fois le tour du bassin. Ënfin il se dirigea vers « son allée », lentement et comme s’il y allait à regret. On eût dit qu’il était à la fois forcé et empêché d’y aller. Il ne se rendait aucun compte de tout cela, et croyait faire comme tous les jours.","Arrived at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the basin and gazed at the swans, then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was completely black with mold and whose hip was missing. There was a pot-bellied middle-class man in his forties who was holding a little five-year-old boy by the hand and saying to him: “Avoid excesses. My son, keep equidistant from despotism and anarchy. — Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he circled the pond once more. Finally he walked towards ""his driveway"", slowly and as if he were going there reluctantly. One would have said that he was both forced and prevented from going there. He didn't realize any of this, and thought he was doing what he did every day.","On arriving at the gardens Marius walked round the fountain and stared at the swans. Then, for a long time, he stood in contemplation in front of a statue with a head completely black with mildew, and a missing hip. Near the fountain was a pot-bellied bourgeois of about forty holding a five-year-old by the hand and saying to the little boy, ‘Avoid extremes. Keep an equal distance, my son, from despotism and anarchy.’ Marius listened to this bourgeois gentleman. Then he circled the fountain once again. At last he headed towards ‘his path’, slowly, and as if he were going there reluctantly. He looked as if he was being compelled to go there, and at the same time prevented from doing so. He was utterly unaware of any of this and thought he was behaving just as he did every day.","On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain basin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing.

Then he made the circuit of the basin once more. At last he directed his course towards “his alley,” slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought that he was doing as he always did.","On reaching the Luxembourg, Marius took a turn round the fountain and looked at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue, the head of which was black with moss, and which was minus a hip.

Keep thyself equally distant from despotism and from anarchy.” Marius listened to this good bourgeois. Then he took another turn around the fountain. Finally, he went towards “his walk;” slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was at once compelled to go and prevented from going.

"A ces fantômes se mêlaient plusieurs prêtres, habitués de ce salon vieux, et quelques gentilshommes ; le marquis de Sassenaye, secrétaire des commandements de madame de Berry, le vicomte de Valory, qui publiait sous le pseudonyme de Charles-Antoine des odes monorimes, le prince de Beauffremont, qui, assez jeune, avait un chef grisonnant et une jolie et spirituelle femme dont les toilettes de velours écarlate à torsades d’or, fort décolletées, effarouchaient ces ténèbres, le marquis de Coriolis d’Espinouse, l’homme de France qui savait le mieux « la politesse proportionnée », le comte d’Amendre, le bonhomme au menton bienveillant, et le chevalier de Port-de-Guy, pilier de la bibliothèque du Louvre, dite le cabinet du roi. M. de Port de Guy, chauve et plutôt vieilli que vieux, contait qu’en 1793, âgé de seize ans, on l’avait mis au bagne comme réfractaire, et ferré avec un octogénaire, l’évêque de Mirepoix, réfractaire aussi, mais comme prêtre, tandis que lui l’était comme soldat. C’était à Toulon. Leur fonction était d’aller la nuit ramasser sur l’échafaud les têtes et les corps des guillotinés du jour ; ils emportaient sur leur dos ces troncs ruisselants, et leurs capes rouges de galériens avaient derrière leur nuque une croûte de sang, sèche le matin, humide le soir. Ces récits tragiques abondaient dans le salon de madame de T. ; et à force d’y maudire Marat, on y applaudissait Trestaillon. Quelques députés du genre introuvable y faisaient leur whist, M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, et le célèbre railleur de la droite, M. Cornet-Dincourt. Le bailli de Ferrette, avec ses culottes courtes et ses jambes maigres, traversait quelquefois ce salon en allant chez M. de Talleyrand. Il avait été le camarade de plaisir de M. le comte d’Artois, et, à l’inverse d’Aristote accroupi sous Campaspe, il avait fait marcher la Guimard à quatre pattes, et de la sorte montré aux siècles un philosophe vengé par un bailli.","With these phantoms mingled several priests, accustomed to this old drawing-room, and a few gentlemen; the Marquis de Sassenaye, secretary of the commandments of Madame de Berry, the Viscount de Valory, who published under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine monorim odes, the Prince de Beauffremont, who, quite young, had a grizzled chef and a pretty and witty woman whose dresses of scarlet velvet with gold twists, very low-cut, terrified this darkness, the Marquis de Coriolis d'Espinouse, the man of France who knew best ""proportioned politeness"", the Comte d'Amendre, the gentleman with a benevolent chin, and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy, pillar of the Louvre library, known as the king's cabinet. M. de Port de Guy, bald and more aged than old, related that in 1793, aged sixteen, he had been put in prison as a refractory, and shod with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory. but as a priest, while he was as a soldier. It was in Toulon. Their function was to go at night to collect from the scaffold the heads and bodies of the guillotined during the day; they carried these dripping trunks on their backs, and their red cloaks of galley slaves had a crust of blood behind their necks, dry in the morning, damp in the evening. These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon; and by dint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. A few deputies of the hard-to-find type did their whist there, M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the famous mocker of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and thin legs, sometimes crossed this room on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been the comrade of pleasure of the Comte d'Artois, and, unlike Aristotle squatting under Campaspe, he had made Guimard walk on all fours, and in this way showed to the centuries a philosopher avenged by a bailiff.","Consorting with these phantoms were several priests, regulars of this elderly salon, and a few noblemen: the Marquis de Sassenay, private secretary to Madame de Berry; the Vicomte de Valory, who under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine published monorhymed odes; the relatively young Prince de Beauffremont, who had greying hair and a pretty, witty wife whose very low-cut dresses of scarlet velvet trimmed with gold braid defied this gloom; the Marquis de Coriolis d’Espinouse, in all of France the man best versed in ‘proportionate politeness’†; the Comte d’Amendre, a fellow with a kindly chin; and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the Louvre library, the so-called royal collection. Monsieur de Port-de-Guy, bald and old-looking rather than old, would relate how in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been sent to the prison hulks for refusing to swear allegiance to the Republic, and had been shackled to an octogenarian, the bishop of Mirepoix, also a non-juror, but of the clergy, whereas he himself was a non-juring soldier. They were in Toulon. Their task was to go to the scaffold at night and collect the heads and bodies of those guillotined during the day. They carried on their backs those dripping headless trunks, and on the nape of their necks their red convict cloaks were caked with blood, dried in the morning, wet at night. There were many such tragic tales in Madame de T’s salon, where cursing Marat meant applauding Trestaillon. A few deputies of the ‘unfindable’ kind played whist here: Monsieur Thibord du Chalard, Monsieur Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the famous right-wing taunter Monsieur Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff of Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs, sometimes called in at this salon on his way to visit Monsieur de Talleyrand. He had been Monsieur le Comte d’Artois’s companion in pleasure-seeking, and unlike Aristotle on his hands and knees under Campaspe, he had La Guimard crawling about on all fours, and so showed the world a philosopher avenged by a bailiff.","the Marquis de Sass****, private secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val ***, who published, under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C***** d’E ******, the man in all France who best understood “proportioned politeness,” the Comte d’Am *****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chévalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King’s cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night.

"Ce digne prêtre était frère d’un marguillier de Saint-Sulpice, lequel avait plusieurs fois remarqué cet homme contemplant son enfant, et la cicatrice qu’il avait sur la joue, et la grosse larme qu’il avait dans les yeux. Cet homme qui avait si bien l’air d’un homme et qui pleurait comme une femme avait frappé le marguillier. Cette figure lui était restée dans l’esprit. Un jour, étant allé à Vernon voir son frère, il rencontra sur le pont le colonel Pontmercy et reconnut l’homme de Saint-Sulpice. Le marguillier en parla au curé, et tous deux sous un prétexte quelconque firent une visite au colonel. Cette visite en amena d’autres. Le colonel d’abord très fermé finit par s’ouvrir, et le curé et le marguillier arrivèrent à savoir toute l’histoire, et comment Pontmercy sacrifiait son bonheur à l’avenir de son enfant. Cela fit que le curé le prit en vénération et en tendresse, et le colonel de son côté prit en affection le curé. D’ailleurs, quand d’aventure ils sont sincères et bons tous les deux, rien ne se pénètre et ne s’amalgame plus aisément qu’un vieux prêtre et un vieux soldat. Au fond, c’est le même homme.

One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he met Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge and recognized the man from Saint-Sulpice. The churchwarden spoke of it to the cure, and both of them, under some pretext or other, paid a visit to the colonel. This visit brought others. The colonel who was very closed at first ended up opening up, and the priest and the churchwarden got to know the whole story, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness for the future of his child. This made the priest take him in veneration and tenderness, and the colonel on his side took in affection the priest. Moreover, when by chance they are both sincere and good, nothing penetrates and amalgamates more easily than an old priest and an old soldier. Basically, it's the same man. One devoted himself to the fatherland below, the other to the fatherland above; no other difference.","That commendable priest was the brother of a warden of St-Sulpice who had on several occasions noticed the man gazing at the child, and the scar on his cheek, and his eyes brimming with tears.

And, moreover, when it happens that both are sincere and good, nothing will mix and amalgamate more easily than an old priest and an old soldier. In reality, they are the same kind of man. One has devoted himself to his country upon earth, the other to his country in heaven; there is no other difference."

"Quelqu’un qui aurait passé à cette époque dans la petite ville de Vernon et qui s’y serait promené sur ce beau pont monumental auquel succédera bientôt, espérons-le, quelque affreux pont en fil de fer, aurait pu remarquer, en laissant tomber ses yeux du haut du parapet, un homme d’une cinquantaine d’années coiffé d’une casquette de cuir, vêtu d’un pantalon et d’une veste de gros drap gris, à laquelle était cousu quelque chose de jaune, qui avait été un ruban rouge, chaussé de sabots, hâlé par le soleil, la face presque noire et les cheveux presque blancs, une large cicatrice sur le front se continuant sur la joue, courbé, voûté, vieilli avant l’âge, se promenant à peu près tous les jours, une bêche et une serpe à la main, dans un de ces compartiments entourés de murs qui avoisinent le pont et bordent comme une chaîne de terrasses la rive gauche de la Seine, charmants enclos pleins de fleurs desquels on dirait, s’ils [s’il] étaient beaucoup plus grands : ce sont des jardins, et, s’ils étaient un peu plus petits : ce sont des bouquets. Tous ces enclos aboutissent par un bout à la rivière et par l’autre à une maison. L’homme en veste et en sabots dont nous venons de parler habitait vers 1817 le plus étroit de ces enclos et la plus humble de ces maisons. Il vivait là seul et solitaire, silencieusement et pauvrement, avec une femme, ni jeune, ni vieille, ni belle, ni laide, ni paysanne, ni bourgeoise, qui le servait. Le carré de terre qu’il appelait son jardin était célèbre dans la ville pour la beauté des fleurs qu’il y cultivait. Les fleurs étaient son occupation.","Someone who had passed at that time in the small town of Vernon and who would have walked there on this beautiful monumental bridge which will soon be succeeded, hopefully, by some ugly wire bridge, could have noticed, while dropping his eyes from the top of the parapet, a man of about fifty wearing a leather cap, dressed in trousers and a jacket of coarse gray cloth, to which was sewn something yellow, which had was a red ribbon, shod in clogs, tanned by the sun, face almost black and hair almost white, a large scar on the forehead continuing on the cheek, bent, stooped, aged before age, walking about near every day, a spade and a sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which adjoin the bridge and border like a chain of terraces the left bank of the Seine, charming enclosures full of flowers from which one would say, 'they [if they] were much larger: they are gardens, and, if they were were a little smaller: they are bouquets. All these enclosures lead at one end to the river and at the other to a house. The man in a jacket and clogs of whom we have just spoken lived around 1817 in the narrowest of these enclosures and the humblest of these houses. He lived there alone and solitary, silently and in poverty, with a woman, neither young nor old, neither beautiful, nor ugly, nor peasant, nor bourgeois, who served him. The patch of land he called his garden was famous in the city for the beauty of the flowers he grew there. Flowers were her occupation.","Anyone who happened to pass through the little town of Vernon during this period, and who walked across that beautiful stone bridge – which, with luck, will soon be succeeded by some hideous iron cable bridge – might, if he had looked down over the parapet, have observed a man of about fifty years of age, in a leather cap, trousers, and a waistcoat of coarse grey cloth to which was sewn something yellow that had once been a red ribbon; he wore wooden clogs, and was tanned by the sun, his face almost black and his hair almost white, with a big scar running across his forehead and continuing down his cheek. Bowed, stooped, prematurely aged, he went about nearly all day long with a hoe or a sickle in his hand, in one of those walled plots that lie adjacent to the bridge and run along the left bank of the Seine like the links of a chain. Delightful enclosures full of flowers – if they were much bigger you would say, ‘These are gardens’, and if a little smaller, ‘These are bouquets.’ All these enclosures have the river at one end and a house at the other. Around 1817 the man in the waistcoat and wooden clogs whom we have just described occupied the smallest of these enclosures and the humblest of these houses. He lived there alone, in solitude, silence and poverty, with a woman neither young nor old, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither peasant nor bourgeois, who was his servant. The patch of land he called his garden was famous in the town for the beauty of the flowers he cultivated there. He devoted himself to his flowers.","Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they much larger: “these are gardens,” and were they a little smaller: “these are bouquets.” All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. These flowers were his occupation.","WHOEVER, at that day, had passed through the little city of Vernon, and walked over that beautiful monumental bridge which will be very soon replaced, let us hope, by some horrid wire bridge, would have noticed, as his glance fell from the top of the parapet, a man of about fifty, with a leather casque on his head, dressed in pantaloons and waistcoat of coarse grey cloth, to which something yellow was stitched which had been a red ribbon, shod in wooden shoes, browned by the sun, his face almost black and his hair almost white, a large scar upon his forehead extending down his cheek, bent, bowed down, older than his years, walking nearly every day with a spade and a pruning knife in his hand, in one of those walled compartments, in the vicinity of the bridge, which, like a chain of terraces border the left bank of the Seine,—charming inclosures full of flowers of which one would say, if they were much larger, they are gardens, and if they were a little smaller, they are bouquets. All these inclosures are bounded by the river on one side and by a house on the other. The man in the waistcoat and wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken lived, about the year 1817, in the smallest of these inclosures and the humblest of these houses. He lived there solitary and alone, in silence and in poverty, with a woman who was neither young nor old, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither peasant nor bourgeois, who waited upon him. The square of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated in it. Flowers were his occupation."

"Le faubourg Saint-Antoine avait encore d’autres causes de tressaillement ; car il reçoit le contre-coup des crises commerciales, des faillites, des grèves, des chômages, inhérents aux grands ébranlements politiques. En temps de révolution la misère est à la fois cause et effet. Le coup qu’elle frappe lui revient. Cette population, pleine de vertu fière, capable au plus haut point de calorique latent, toujours prête aux prises d’armes, prompte aux explosions, irritée, profonde, minée, semblait n’attendre que la chute d’une flammèche. Toutes les fois que de certaines étincelles flottent sur l’horizon, chassées par le vent des événements, on ne peut s’empêcher de songer au faubourg Saint-Antoine et au redoutable hasard qui a placé aux portes de Paris cette poudrière de souffrances et d’idées.","The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had still other causes of tremor; because it receives the backlash of commercial crises, bankruptcies, strikes, unemployment, inherent in major political upheavals.

Full of proud courage, with the highest capacity for latent heat, always ready to take up arms, prone to violent outbursts, volatile, intense, mined, this population seemed to be just waiting for a spark to fall. Whenever certain fiery particles drift across the horizon driven by the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of Faubourg St-Antoine and the extraordinary accident of fate that has placed at the gates of Paris this powder-keg of suffering and ideas.","The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances.

"Exceptons Paris pourtant. Dans une mesure relative, et nonobstant le souvenir que nous venons de rappeler, l’exception est juste. Tandis que dans toute autre grande ville, un enfant vagabond est un homme perdu, tandis que, presque partout, l’enfant livré à lui-même est en quelque sorte dévoué et abandonné à une sorte d’immersion fatale dans les vices publics qui dévore en lui l’honnêteté et la conscience, le gamin de Paris, insistons-y, si fruste et si entamé à la surface, est intérieurement à peu près intact. Chose magnifique à constater et qui éclate dans la splendide probité de nos révolutions populaires, une certaine incorruptibilité résulte de l’idée qui est dans l’air de Paris comme du sel qui est dans l’eau de l’océan. Respirer Paris, cela conserve l’âme.","Except for Paris, however. To a relative extent, and notwithstanding the memory we have just recalled, the exception is just. While in any other great city a wandering child is a lost man, while almost everywhere the child left to his own devices is somehow devoted and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in public vices which devours in him the honesty and the conscience, the urchin of Paris, let us insist on it, so rough and so damaged on the surface, is interiorly almost intact. Magnificent thing to note and which shines in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which is in the air of Paris like salt which is in the water of the ocean. Breath in Paris, it saves the soul.","Paris excepted, however. Relatively speaking, and notwithstanding that surviving memory we have just referred to, it is a fair exception. Whereas in any other city a vagabond child is a doomed man, whereas almost everywhere the child left to fend for itself is in a way consigned and abandoned to a kind of fatal submersion in public vices that destroy honesty and conscience in the child, we are adamant that, no matter how damaged and spoiled on the surface, inwardly the Paris gamin is virtually unscathed. Wonderful to relate, and clearly apparent in the splendid integrity of our popular revolutions, a certain incorruptibility ensues from the idea inherent in the air of Paris as from the salt inherent in the waters of the ocean. Inhaling Paris preserves the soul.","Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative measure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the exception is just.

It is a magnificent thing to put on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.","We must except Paris, however. To a considerable degree, and notwithstanding the reminiscence we have just recalled, the exception is just. While in every other city, the truant boy is the lost man; while, almost everywhere, the boy given up to himself is, in some sort, devoted and abandoned to a species of fatal immersion in public vices which eat out of him all that is respectable, even conscience itself, the gamin of Paris, we must insist, chipped and spotted as he is on the surface, is almost intact within. A thing magnificent to think of, and one that shines forth resplendently in the glorious probity of our popular revolutions; a certain incorruptibility results from the mental fluid which is to the air of Paris what salt is to the water of the ocean.

"Marius du reste était navré. Tout était de nouveau rentré dans une trappe. Il ne voyait plus rien devant lui ; sa vie était replongée dans ce mystère où il errait à tâtons. Il avait un moment revu de très près dans cette obscurité la jeune fille qu’il aimait, le vieillard qui semblait son père, ces êtres inconnus qui étaient son seul intérêt et sa seule espérance en ce monde ; et au moment où il avait cru les saisir, un souffle avait emporté toutes ces ombres. Pas une étincelle de certitude et de vérité n’avait jailli même du choc le plus effrayant. Aucune conjecture possible. Il ne savait même plus le nom qu’il avait cru savoir. A coup sûr ce n’était plus Ursule. Et l’Alouette était un sobriquet. Et que penser du vieillard ? Se cachait-il en effet de la police ? L’ouvrier à cheveux blancs que Marius avait rencontré aux environs des Invalides lui était revenu à l’esprit. Il devenait probable maintenant que cet ouvrier et M. Leblanc étaient le même homme. Il se déguisait donc ? Cet homme avait des côtés héroïques et des côtés équivoques. Pourquoi n’avait-il pas appelé au secours ? pourquoi s’était-il enfui ? était-il, oui ou non, le père de la jeune fille ? enfin était-il réellement l’homme que Thénardier avait cru reconnaître ? Thénardier avait pu se méprendre ? Autant de problèmes sans issue. Tout ceci, il est vrai, n’ôtait rien au charme angélique de la jeune fille du Luxembourg. Détresse poignante ; Marius avait une passion dans le cœur, et la nuit sur les yeux. Il était poussé, il était attiré, et il ne pouvait bouger. Tout s’était évanoui, excepté l’amour. De l’amour même, il avait perdu les instincts et les illuminations subites. Ordinairement cette flamme qui nous brûle nous éclaire aussi un peu, et nous jette quelque lueur utile au dehors. Ces sourds conseils de la passion, Marius ne les entendait même plus. Jamais il ne se disait : Si j’allais là ? si j’essayais ceci ? Celle qu’il ne pouvait plus nommer Ursule était évidemment quelque part ; rien n’avertissait Marius du côté où il fallait chercher. Toute sa vie se résumait maintenant en deux mots : une incertitude absolue dans une brume impénétrable. La revoir, elle ; il y aspirait toujours, il ne l’espérait plus.","Marius, moreover, was heartbroken. Everything was back in a trap door. He no longer saw anything in front of him; his life was plunged back into this mystery in which he groped his way. He had for a moment seen very closely again in this darkness the young girl he loved, the old man who seemed to be his father, those unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and at the moment when he thought he had grasped them, a breath had carried away all these shadows. Not a spark of certainty and truth had sprung from even the most frightening shock. No guesswork possible. He didn't even know the name he thought he knew. Certainly it was no longer Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what about the old man? Was he in fact hiding from the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had met near the Invalides came back to his mind. It now became probable that this workman and Mr. Leblanc were the same man. So he was disguising himself? This man had heroic sides and equivocal sides. Why didn't he call for help? why had he run away? Was he, yes or no, the girl's father? finally, was he really the man Thénardier thought he recognized? Thénardier could have been mistaken? So many endless problems. All this, it is true, took nothing away from the angelic charm of the young girl from Luxembourg. Poignant distress; Marius had a passion in his heart, and darkness in his eyes. He was pushed, he was pulled, and he couldn't move. Everything had vanished, except love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily this flame which burns us also enlightens us a little, and throws us some useful light outside. These deaf advices of passion, Marius no longer even heard them. He never said to himself: Suppose I went there? if i try this? She whom he could no longer call Ursule was obviously somewhere; nothing told Marius where to look. His whole life was now summed up in two words: absolute uncertainty in an impenetrable haze. See her again; he still aspired to it, he no longer hoped for it.","Marius was in any case devastated. Once again everything was closed to him. He could see nothing in front of him any more. His life was plunged back into that mystery where he was left groping his way. In that obscurity he had for a moment seen again very close at hand the young girl he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown persons who were his sole interest and his sole hope in this world. And just when he thought he had them in his grasp all these shadows had been blown away. Even the most frightful shock had produced not one spark of certainty or truth. No conceivable explanation. Now he did not even know the name he had thought he knew. Certainly, it was no longer Ursule. And Alouette was a nickname. And what was to be made of the old man? Was he in fact hiding from the police? The white-haired workman Marius had run into near Les Invalides came back to mind. That worker and Monsieur Leblanc, it now seemed likely, were one and the same. So he disguised himself? There were heroic aspects and ambiguous aspects to this individual. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he the young girl’s father, yes or no? And was he really the man Thénardier thought he had recognized? Could Thénardier have been mistaken? So many insoluble problems. None of this, it is true, detracted in the slightest from the angelic charms of the young girl from the Luxembourg Gardens. A sorry plight: Marius had passion in his heart and darkness before his eyes. He was driven, he was drawn and he could not move. Everything was gone except love. Even love’s instincts and sudden enlightenments he had lost. Ordinarily this flame burning within us also illuminates us a little, and casts some useful light around us. But Marius was no longer even aware of these quiet promptings of passion. He never said to himself, ‘What if I went there? What if I tried this?’ The girl he could no longer call Ursule must be somewhere. Nothing suggested to Marius whereabouts he should look for her. His whole life could now be summed up in a nutshell: total uncertainty in impenetrable obscurity. He still yearned to see her again but had no expectation of doing so.","Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a trap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thénardier thought that he recognized? Thénardier might have been mistaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself: “What if I were to go to such a place? What if I were to try such and such a thing?” The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it.","Marius, moreover, was in sore affliction. Everything had relapsed into darkness. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again plunged into that mystery in which he had been blindly groping. He had for a moment seen close at hand in that obscurity, the young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed her father, these unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and at the moment he had thought to hold them fast, a breath had swept all those shadows away. Not a spark of certainty or truth had escaped even from that most fearful shock. No conjecture was possible. He knew not even the name which he had thought he knew. Certainly it was no longer Ursula. And the Lark was a nickname. And what should he think of the old man? Was he really hiding from the police? The white-haired working-man who Marius had met in the neighbourhood of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now became probable that that working-man and M. Leblanc were the same man. He disguised himself then? This man had heroic sides and equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? why had he escaped? was he, yes or no, the father of the young girl? Finally, was he really the man whom Thénardier thought he recognised? Could Thénardier have been mistaken? So many problems without issue. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Bitter wretchedness ; Marius had a passion in his heart, and night over his eyes. He was pushed, he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had vanished, except love. Even of love, he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which consumes us, illumines us also a little, and sheds some useful light without. Those vague promptings of passion, Marius no longer even heard. Never did he say to himself: Suppose I go there? Suppose I try this? She whom he could no longer call Ursula was evidently somewhere ; nothing indicated to Marius the direction in which he must seek for her. His whole life was now resumed in two words: an absolute uncertainty in an impenetrable mist. To see her again. Her; he aspired to this continually; he hoped for it no longer."

"A partir de ce moment, tout fut dit. L’ogre de Corse, — l’usurpateur, — le tyran, — le monstre qui était l’amant de ses sœurs, — l’histrion qui prenait des leçons de Talma, — l’empoisonneur de Jaffa, — le tigre, — Buonaparté, — tout cela s’évanouit, et fit place dans son esprit à un vague et éclatant rayonnement où resplendissait à une hauteur inaccessible le pâle fantôme de marbre de César. L’empereur n’avait été pour son père que le bien-aimé capitaine qu’on admire et pour qui l’on se dévoue ; il fut pour Marius quelque chose de plus. Il fut le constructeur prédestiné du groupe français succédant au groupe romain dans la domination de l’univers. Il fut le prodigieux architecte d’un écroulement, le continuateur de Charlemagne, de Louis XI, de Henri IV, de Richelieu, de Louis XIV et du comité de salut public, ayant sans doute ses taches, ses fautes et même son crime, c’est-à-dire étant homme ; mais auguste dans ses fautes, brillant dans ses taches, puissant dans son crime. Il fut l’homme prédestiné qui avait forcé toutes les nations à dire : ― la grande nation. Il fut mieux encore ; il fut l’incarnation même de la France, conquérant l’Europe par l’épée qu’il tenait et le monde par la clarté qu’il jetait. Marius vit en Bonaparte le spectre éblouissant qui se dressera toujours sur la frontière et qui gardera l’avenir. Despote, mais dictateur ; despote résultant d’une république et résumant une révolution. Napoléon devint pour lui l’homme-peuple comme Jésus est l’homme-Dieu.","From that moment, everything was said. The ogre of Corsica, — the usurper, — the tyrant, — the monster who was the lover of his sisters, — the actor who took lessons from Talma, — the poisoner of Jaffa, — the tiger, — Buonaparté—all that vanished, and gave place in his mind to a vague and dazzling radiance in which the pale marble phantom of Caesar shone at an inaccessible height. The Emperor had been for his father only the beloved captain whom one admires and for whom one devotes oneself; he was for Marius something more. He was the predestined builder of the French group succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe. He was the prodigious architect of a collapse, the successor of Charlemagne, of Louis XI, of Henri IV, of Richelieu, of Louis XIV and of the committee of public safety, having undoubtedly his stains, his faults and even his crime, c that is, being a man; but august in his faults, brilliant in his stains, powerful in his crime. He was the predestinated man who forced all the nations to say, ―the great nation. It was better still; he was the very incarnation of France, conquering Europe by the sword he held and the world by the clarity he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling specter which will always stand on the frontier and guard the future. Despot, but dictator; despot resulting from a republic and summarizing a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus is the man-God.","From that moment there was no going back. The Ogre of Corsica, the usurper, the tyrant, the monster who was his own sisters’ lover, the charlatan who took lessons from Talma, the poisoner of Jaffa, the tiger, Buonaparté – all this vanished and gave way in his mind to an indeterminate and brilliant radiance, and, shining high out of reach within it, the pale marble phantom of Caesar. For his father, the emperor had been simply the well beloved captain, admired and devotedly served. For Marius, he was something more. He was the predestined master-builder of the French order, taking over from the Roman order in ruling the universe. He was the prodigious architect of a collapse, following on from Charlemagne, Louis XI, Henri IV, Richelieu, Louis XIV and the Committee of Public Safety; doubtless with his flaws, his lapses and even his criminality – in other words, a man – but majestic in his lapses, splendid in his flaws, strong in his criminality. He was the man of destiny who had compelled all nations to recognize ‘the great nation’! Better still, he was the actual embodiment of France, conquering Europe by the sword he held, and the world by the light he cast. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling apparition that will always rise up at the frontier and guard the future. Despot, but state-appointed, a dictator produced by a republic and encapsulating a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-nation just as Jesus Christ is the man-God.","All at once, without himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he was obeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window, gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, the eternal immensity, and exclaimed: “Long live the Emperor!” From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,—the usurper,—the tyrant,—the monster who was the lover of his own sisters,—the actor who took lessons of Talma,—the poisoner of Jaffa,—the tiger,—Buonaparte,—all this vanished, and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The Emperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, for whom one sacrifices one’s self; he was something more to Marius. He was the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect, of a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety, having his spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man, that is to say; but august in his faults, brilliant in his spots, powerful in his crime. He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: “The great nation!” He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of France, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world by the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the future. Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus Christ is the man-God.","From that moment it was all over; the Corsican Ogre—the usurper—the tyrant—the monster who was the lover of his sisters—the actor who took lessons from Talma—the poisoner of Jaffa—the tiger—Buonaparté—all this vanished, and gave place in his mind to a suffused and brilliant radiance in which shone out from an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The emperor had been to his father only the beloved captain, whom one admires, and for whom one devotes himself; to Marius he was something more. He was the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman group in the mastery of the world. He was the stupendous architect of a downfall, the successor of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety, having doubtless his blemishes, his faults, and even his crimes, that is to say being man; but august in his faults, brilliant in his blemishes, mighty in his crimes. He was the man foreordained to force all nations to say: the Grand Nation. He was better still; he was the very incarnation of France, conquering Europe by the sword which he held, and the world by the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the flashing spectre which will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the future.

Le travail, le salaire, le pain, le feu, le courage, la bonne volonté, tout lui manque à la fois.

Vincennes would put the cuffs on Socrates just as the Agora would clap Diderot in gaol. Grimod de la Reynière has discovered roast beef cooked in dripping, just as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog. The trapeze that features in Plautus we see reappearing under the Arc de l’Étoile balloon. The sword-eater encountered by Apuleius at the Poecile Portico is a sabre-swallower on the Pont-Neuf. Rameau’s nephew and Curculio the parasite are a perfect match. Ergasilus would have d’Aigrefeuille introduce him to Cambacérès. Rome’s four young fops Alcesimarchus, Phaedromus, Diabolus and Argyrippus join the end-of-carnival parade from La Courtille into Paris in the Labatut post-chaise. Aulus Gellius would stop to watch Congrio no longer than would Charles Nodier to watch Pulchinello. Marton is no tigress, but Pardalisca was no dragon. Pantolabus the joker joshes the wastrel Nomentanus in the Café Anglais. Hermogenes is a tenor in the Champs-Élysées and Thrasius the beggar, dressed up as Bobèche, passes the hat round for him. The bore who buttonholes you in the Tuileries makes you repeat two thousand years later Thesprio’s exclamation: Quis properantem me prehendit pallio?† Suresnes wine replicates the wine of Alba, Désaugier’s glassful of red corresponds to Balatro’s huge goblet. In the rain at night the same vaporous glimmerings emanate from Père-Lachaise and the Esquiline, and the pauper’s grave bought for five years is the equivalent of the slave’s hired coffin.","For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living manners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with heaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, the Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a Via Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion; and it replaces the Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its majo is called “faraud,” its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is the market-porter, its lazzarone is the pègre, its cockney is the native of Ghent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer. Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncœur the grenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among bric-à-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist as just as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reynière discovered larded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the trapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc of l’Etoile, the sword-eater of Pœcilus encountered by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on the Pont-Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio the parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented to Cambacères by d’Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus, Phœdromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from Courtille in Labatut’s posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front of Congrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is not a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in the Café Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor in the Champs-Élysées, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like Bobèche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the button of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand years Thesprion’s apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehendit pallio? The wine on Surêne is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, Père-Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains the same gleams as the Esquiliæ, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly the equivalent of the slave’s hived coffin.","For Paris is a sum total.

"Dans les griefs de l’histoire contre Louis-Philippe, il y a une défalcation à faire ; il y a ce qui accuse la royauté, ce qui accuse le règne, et ce qui accuse le roi ; trois colonnes qui donnent chacune un total différent. Le droit démocratique confisqué, le progrès devenu le deuxième intérêt, les protestations de la rue réprimées violemment, l’exécution militaire des insurrections, l’émeute passée par les armes, la rue Transnonain, les conseils de guerre, l’absorption du pays réel par le pays légal, le gouvernement de compte à demi avec trois cent mille privilégiés, sont le fait de la royauté ; la Belgique refusée, l’Algérie trop durement conquise, et, comme l’Inde par les anglais, avec plus de barbarie que de civilisation, le manque de foi à Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz acheté, Pritchard payé, sont le fait du règne ; la politique plus familiale que nationale est le fait du roi.","In the grievances of history against Louis-Philippe, there is a deduction to be made; there is what accuses royalty, what accuses the reign, and what accuses the king; three columns that each give a different total.

For some of these charges royalty is to blame, for some, the reign, and for some, the king. Three columns that each give a different total. Democratic rights suspended, progress reduced to a matter of secondary importance, street protests violently suppressed, insurrections quelled by military force, rioters fired on, Rue Transnonain, courts-martial, the takeover of the whole population by the enfranchised population, government by the privileged three hundred thousand – this is royalty’s doing. Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered and, like India by the English, with more barbarity than civilization , the breach of faith with Abd al-Qader, Blaye, Deutz bribed, Pritchard compensated – this is the regime’s doing.

"On y entendait des paroles comme celles-ci : ― Je ne sais pas les noms des chefs. Nous autres, nous ne saurons le jour que deux heures d’avance. — Un ouvrier disait : ― Nous sommes trois cents, mettons chacun dix sous, cela fera cent cinquante francs pour fabriquer des balles et de la poudre. — Un autre disait : ― Je ne demande pas six mois, je n’en demande pas deux. Avant quinze jours nous serons en parallèle avec le gouvernement. Avec vingt-cinq mille hommes on peut se mettre en face. — Un autre disait : ― Je ne me couche pas parce que je fais des cartouches la nuit. — De temps en temps des hommes « en bourgeois et en beaux habits » venaient, « faisant des embarras », et ayant l’air « de commander », donnaient des poignées de mains aux plus importants, et s’en allaient. Ils ne restaient jamais plus de dix minutes. On échangeait à voix basse des propos significatifs : ― Le complot est mûr, la chose est comble. — « C’était bourdonné par tous ceux qui étaient là », pour emprunter l’expression même d’un des assistants. L’exaltation était telle qu’un jour, en plein cabaret, un ouvrier s’écria : Nous n’avons pas d’armes ! — Un de ses camarades répondit : ― Les soldats en ont ! — parodiant ainsi, sans s’en douter, la proclamation de Bonaparte à l’armée d’Italie. ― « Quand ils avaient quelque chose de plus secret, ajoute un rapport, ils ne se le communiquaient pas là. » On ne comprend guère ce qu’ils pouvaient cacher après avoir dit ce qu’ils disaient.","You could hear words like these: ―I don't know the names of the chiefs. We others will only know the day two hours in advance. — A workman said: “There are three hundred of us, put ten sous each, that will make one hundred and fifty francs to manufacture bullets and powder. ""Another said: ―I'm not asking for six months, I'm not asking for two. Before fifteen days we will be in parallel with the government. With twenty-five thousand men we can face it. “Another said: ―I don't go to bed because I shoot cartridges at night. — From time to time men ""in bourgeois and fine clothes"" came, ""making trouble"", and looking ""in command"", shook hands with the most important, and went away. They never stayed longer than ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low voice: ―The plot is ripe, the thing is complete. ""It was buzzed by everyone who was there,"" to borrow the very expression of one of the assistants. The excitement was such that one day, in the middle of a cabaret, a worker exclaimed: We have no weapons! — One of his comrades answered: ―The soldiers have them! — thus parodying, without suspecting it, Bonaparte’s proclamation to the army of Italy. ―“When they had something more secret, adds a report, they did not communicate it there. It is difficult to understand what they could hide after having said what they said.","Such comments as this were to be heard: ‘I don’t know the names of the leaders. The likes of us won’t know the day until two hours beforehand.’ One workman said, ‘There are three hundred of us, if we each contribute ten sous that’ll be one hundred and fifty francs for making powder and shot.’ Another said, ‘I’m not asking for six months, I’m not even asking for two. We’ll be a match for the government in less than a fortnight. With twenty-five thousand men we can take them on.’ Another said, ‘I don’t go to bed because I’m making cartridges all night.’ From time to time ‘well dressed’ men ‘in civilian clothes’, apparently ‘in charge’, came ‘swaggering’ along, and shook hands with ‘the ringleaders’, and then went away again. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Meaningful remarks were exchanged in low voices: ‘The moment’s ripe, it’s about to happen.’ ‘Everyone there was buzzing with it’, to borrow the expression actually used by one of those present. The excitement was such that one day, in the middle of the wine shop, a worker exclaimed, ‘We have no weapons!’ In an unwitting travesty of Bonaparte’s proclamation to the army in Italy, one of his comrades replied, ‘The soldiers have!’ ‘Anything more secret’, adds one report, ‘they did not communicate to each other.’ It is hard to understand what else they could be hiding after having said what they said.","Words like the following could be heard there:— “I don’t know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand.” One workman said: “There are three hundred of us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot.” Another said: “I don’t ask for six months, I don’t ask for even two. In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. With twenty-five thousand men we can face them.” Another said: “I don’t sleep at night, because I make cartridges all night.” From time to time, men “of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats” came and “caused embarrassment,” and with the air of “command,” shook hands with the most important, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: “The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged.” “It was murmured by all who were there,” to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop: “We have no arms!” One of his comrades replied: “The soldiers have!” thus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte’s proclamation to the army in Italy: “When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,” adds one report, “they did not communicate it to each other. ” It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said.","Such words as these were heard.—“I don’t know the names of the chiefs. As for us, we shall only know the day two hours beforehand.” A working-man said: “There are three hundred of us, let us put in ten sous each, that will make a hundred and fifty francs to manufacture powder and ball.” Another said: “I don’t ask six months, I don’t ask two. In less than a fortnight we shall meet the government face to face. With twenty-five thousand men we can make a stand.” Another said: “I don’t go to bed, because I am making cartridges all night.” From time to time, men “like bourgeois, and in fine coats” came, “causing embarrassment,” and having the air “of command,” gave a grip of the hand to the most important, and went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significant words were exchanged in a low voice: “The plot is ripe, the thing is complete.” “This was buzzed by all who were there,” to borrow the very expression of one of the participants.

Elle était pieds nus et en haillons comme le jour où elle était entrée si résolûment dans sa chambre, seulement ses haillons avaient deux mois de plus ; les trous étaient plus larges, les guenilles plus sordides. C’était cette même voix enrouée, ce même front terni et ridé par le hâle, ce même regard libre, égaré et vacillant.

"La vie devint sévère pour Marius. Manger ses habits et sa montre, ce n’était rien. Il mangea de cette chose inexprimable qu’on appelle de la vache enragée. Chose horrible, qui contient les jours sans pain, les nuits sans sommeil, les soirs sans chandelle, l’âtre sans feu, les semaines sans travail, l’avenir sans espérance, l’habit percé au coude, le vieux chapeau qui fait rire les jeunes filles, la porte qu’on trouve fermée le soir parce qu’on ne paye pas son loyer, l’insolence du portier et du gargotier, les ricanements des voisins, les humiliations, la dignité refoulée, les besognes quelconques acceptées, les dégoûts, l’amertume, l’accablement. Marius apprit comment on dévore tout cela, et comment ce sont souvent les seules choses qu’on ait à dévorer. A ce moment de l’existence où l’homme a besoin d’orgueil, parce qu’il a besoin d’amour, il se sentit moqué parce qu’il était mal vêtu, et ridicule parce qu’il était pauvre. A l’âge où la jeunesse vous gonfle le cœur d’une fierté impériale, il abaissa plus d’une fois ses yeux sur ses bottes trouées, et il connut les hontes injustes et les rougeurs poignantes de la misère. Admirable et terrible épreuve dont les faibles sortent infâmes, dont les forts sortent sublimes. Creuset où la destinée jette un homme, toutes les fois qu’elle veut avoir un gredin ou un demi-dieu.","Life became severe for Marius. Eating his clothes and his watch was nothing. He ate this inexpressible thing called mad cow. Horrible thing, which contains the days without bread, the nights without sleep, the evenings without candles, the hearth without fire, the weeks without work, the future without hope, the coat pierced at the elbow, the old hat that makes you laugh the young girls, the door that you find closed in the evening because you don't pay your rent, the insolence of the doorman and the gargoyle, the sniggers of the neighbours, the humiliations, the repressed dignity, the unspecified tasks accepted, the disgust, bitterness, overwhelm. Marius learned how one devours all that, and how they are often the only things one has to devour. At this moment of existence when man needs pride, because he needs love, he felt mocked because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age when youth swells your heart with imperial pride, he more than once lowered his eyes to his torn boots, and he knew the unjust shames and the poignant blushes of misery. Admirable and terrible ordeal from which the weak come out infamous, from which the strong come out sublime. Crucible into which destiny throws a man, whenever it wishes to have a scoundrel or a demi-god.","Life became hard for Marius. Using his clothes and his watch for food was nothing. There was much worse he had to stomach. Terrible hardship, consisting of days without bread, nights without sleep, no candle in the evening, no fire in the hearth, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat worn through at the elbows, an old hat that makes young girls laugh, a door found locked at night because the rent has not been paid, the insolence of the doorman and the eating-house keeper, the sneering of neighbours, humiliations, dignity trampled underfoot, having to accept any kind of work, demoralization, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how to swallow all this, and how it might often be all there was to swallow. At that time in a man’s life when he needs self-respect because he needs love, he felt mocked because he was badly dressed and laughable because he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart with an imperial pride he lowered his eyes more than once to his boots with holes in them, and he experienced the unjust disgrace and agonizing shame of poverty. Awesome and terrible test from which the weak emerge degenerate , the strong emerge sublime. Crucible into which fate casts a man whenever it wants a villain or a demigod.","Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enragé; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one at night because one’s rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has to devour. At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.","LIFE BECAME STERN to Marius. To eat his coats and his watch was nothing. He chewed that inexpressible thing which is called the cud of bitterness. A horrible thing, which includes days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without labour, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which makes young girls laugh, the door found shut against you at night because you have not paid your rent, the insolence of the porter and the landlord, the jibes of neighbours, humiliations, self-respect outraged, any drudgery acceptable, disgust, bitterness, prostration—Marius learned how one swallows down all these things, and how they are often the only things that one has to swallow. At that period of existence, when man has need of pride, because he has need of love, he felt that he was mocked at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculed because he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart with an imperial pride, he more than once dropped his eyes upon his worn-out boots, and experienced the undeserved shame and the poignant blushes of misery. Wonderful and terrible trial, from which the feeble come out infamous, from which the strong come out sublime. Crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever she desires a scoundrel or a demi-god."

Il combinait ses stations derrière les arbres et les piédestaux des statues avec un machiavélisme profond, de façon à se faire voir le plus possible à la jeune fille et à se laisser voir le moins possible du vieux monsieur. Quelquefois, pendant des demi-heures entières, il restait immobile à l’ombre d’un Léonidas ou d’un Spartacus quelconque, tenant à la main un livre au-dessus duquel ses yeux, doucement levés, allaient chercher la belle fille, et elle, de son côté, détournait avec un vague sourire son charmant profil vers lui. Tout en causant le plus naturellement et le plus tranquillement du monde avec l’homme à cheveux blancs, elle appuyait sur Marius toutes les rêveries d’un œil virginal et passionné. Antique et immémorial manège qu’Ève savait dès le premier jour du monde et que toute femme sait dès le premier jour de la vie ! Sa bouche donnait la réplique à l’un et son regard donnait la réplique à l’autre.","He had finally grown bolder, and he approached the bench.

Sometimes, for entire half-hours, he would remain motionless in the shadow of some Leonidas or some Spartacus, holding in his hand a book above which his eyes, gently raised, sought out the beautiful girl, and she, for her part, turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While chatting in the most natural and calm way in the world with the white-haired man, she pressed all her reveries on Marius with a virginal and passionate eye.

Sometimes he would remain motionless for whole half-hours at a stretch in the shadow of some Leonidas or Spartacus, a book held in his hand, his eyes slightly raised over the edge of it, seeking out the beautiful girl, and she for her part with a vague smile turned her lovely profile towards him. She could not have been any more calm and natural as she chatted with the white-haired man, while her virginal and passionate gaze dwelt dreamily on Marius. An ancient ploy dating back to time immemorial, one that Eve knew from the first day of the world and that every woman knows from the first day of her life! With her lips she responded to one, and with her eyes to the other.","He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not pass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers.

Sometimes, he remained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye.

However he passed before it no more, obeying at once the instinct of timidity and the instinct of prudence, peculiar to lovers.

"Les silhouettes farouches qui rôdent dans cette fosse, presque bêtes, presque fantômes, ne s’occupent pas du progrès universel, elles ignorent l’idée et le mot, elles n’ont souci que de l’assouvissement individuel. Elles sont presque inconscientes, et il y a au dedans d’elles une sorte d’effacement effrayant. Elles ont deux mères, toutes deux marâtres, l’ignorance et la misère. Elles ont un guide, le besoin ; et, pour toutes les formes de la satisfaction, l’appétit. Elles sont brutalement voraces, c’est-à-dire féroces, non à la façon du tyran, mais à la façon du tigre. De la souffrance ces larves passent au crime ; filiation fatale, engendrement vertigineux, logique de l’ombre. Ce qui rampe dans le troisième dessous social, ce n’est plus la réclamation étouffée de l’absolu ; c’est la protestation de la matière. L’homme y devient dragon. Avoir faim, avoir soif, c’est le point de départ ; être Satan, c’est le point d’arrivée. De cette cave sort Lacenaire.","The fierce silhouettes that roam in this pit, almost stupid, almost phantoms, are not concerned with universal progress, they are unaware of the idea and the word, they are only concerned with individual satisfaction. They are almost unconscious, and there is a kind of frightening effacement inside them. They have two mothers, both stepmothers, ignorance and poverty. They have a guide, the need; and, for all forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say ferocious, not in the way of the tyrant, but in the way of the tiger. From suffering these larvae pass to crime; fatal filiation, vertiginous begetting, shadowy logic. What crawls into the third social underworld is no longer the stifled claim of the absolute; it is the protest of matter. Man becomes a dragon there. To be hungry, to be thirsty is the starting point; being Satan is the end point. From this cellar comes Lacenaire.","The savage figures prowling in this gulf – near-beasts, near-phantoms – are not concerned with universal progress, the concept and the word are unknown to them, they care only for individual gratification. They are barely conscious, and there is inside them a kind of terrifying blankness. They have two mothers, both stepmothers, ignorance and destitution. They have a guide, necessity, and an appetite for every type of indulgence. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ravenous, not tyrant-like but tiger-like. These larvae move on from suffering to crime – inevitable progression, dizzying development, the logic of darkness. What creeps about in society’s third level down is no longer the stifled claim to the absolute – it is the protest of matter. Man becomes dragon here. Going hungry, being thirsty – that is the starting-point. Embodying Satan – that is where it ends. Out of this cavern comes Lacenaire.","The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost phantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost unconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and misery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ferocious, not after the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger. From suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest of matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty—that is the point of departure; to be Satan—that is the point reached. From that vault Lacenaire emerges.","The savage outlines which prowl over this grave, half brute, half phantom, have no thought for universal progress, they ignore ideas and words, they have no care but for individual glut.

"On le voit, à la façon de tous les nouveaux venus dans une religion, sa conversion l’enivrait, il se précipitait dans l’adhésion et il allait trop loin. Sa nature était ainsi ; une fois sur une pente, il lui était presque impossible d’enrayer. Le fanatisme pour l’épée le gagnait et compliquait dans son esprit l’enthousiasme pour l’idée. Il ne s’apercevait point qu’avec le génie, et pêle-mêle, il admirait la force, c’est-à-dire qu’il installait dans les deux compartiments de son idolâtrie, d’un côté ce qui est divin, de l’autre ce qui est brutal. A plusieurs égards, il s’était mis à se tromper autrement. Il admettait tout. Il y a une manière de rencontrer l’erreur en allant à la vérité. Il avait une sorte de bonne foi violente qui prenait tout en bloc. Dans la voie nouvelle où il était entré, en jugeant les torts de l’ancien régime comme en mesurant la gloire de Napoléon, il négligeait les circonstances atténuantes.","We see that, like all newcomers to a religion, his conversion intoxicated him, he rushed into adherence and he went too far. His nature was so; once on a slope, it was almost impossible for him to stop. The fanaticism for the sword won over him and complicated in his mind the enthusiasm for the idea. He did not notice that with genius, and pell-mell, he admired force, that is to say, he installed in the two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand what is divine, on the other, which is brutal. In many respects he had begun to deceive himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There is a way to meet error by going to the truth. He had a kind of violent good faith that took everything together. In the new path he had entered, in judging the wrongs of the old regime as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected extenuating circumstances.","Evidently, like all new converts to a religion, he was elated by his conversion, threw himself into it, and went too far. That was his nature: once he started to follow his inclination it was almost impossible that he hold himself in check. A zealot’s passion for the sword took hold of him and became embroiled in his mind with his enthusiasm for the idea. He did not realize that along with genius, and entangled with it, he was admiring might; in other words, he was setting up in the double niche of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In several respects he was now misguided in a different way. He accepted everything. In seeking out the truth, there is a way of being misled. He had a kind of impulsive good faith that swallowed everything whole. On the new course he had taken, in condemning the wrongs of the old regime as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected attenuating circumstances.","It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, his conversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downward slope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism for the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius, and pell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he had set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There is a way of encountering error while on one’s way to the truth. He had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new path which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime, as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating circumstances.","We see, like all new converts to a religion, his conversion intoxicated him, he plunged headlong into adhesion, and he went too far. His nature was such; once upon a descent it was almost impossible for him to hold back.

He did not perceive that along with genius, and indiscriminately, he was admiring force, that is to say that he was installing in the two compartments of his idolatry, on one side what is divine, and on the other what is brutal. In several respects he began to deceive himself in other matters. He admitted everything. There is a way of meeting error while on the road of truth. He had a sort of wilful implicit faith which swallowed everything in mass.

"Enfin, dans le trajet de la masure Gorbeau à la Force, un des principaux arrêtés, Claquesous, s’était perdu. On ne savait comment cela s’était fait, les agents et les sergents « n’y comprenaient rien », il s’était changé en vapeur, il avait glissé entre les poucettes, il avait coulé entre les fentes de la voiture, le fiacre était fêlé et avait fui ; on ne savait que dire, sinon qu’en arrivant à la prison, plus de Claquesous. Il y avait là de la féerie, ou de la police. Claquesous avait-il fondu dans les ténèbres comme un flocon de neige dans l’eau ? Y avait-il eu connivence inavouée des agents ? Cet homme appartenait-il à la double énigme du désordre et de l’ordre ? Était-il concentrique à l’infraction et à la répression ? Ce sphinx avait-il les pattes de devant dans le crime et les pattes de derrière dans l’autorité ? Javert n’acceptait point ces combinaisons-là, et se fût hérissé devant de tels compromis ; mais son escouade comprenait d’autres inspecteurs que lui, plus initiés peut-être que lui-même, quoique ses subordonnés, aux secrets de la préfecture, et Claquesous était un tel scélérat qu’il pouvait être un fort bon agent. Être en de si intimes rapports d’escamotage avec la nuit, cela est excellent pour le brigandage et admirable pour la police. Il y a de ces coquins à deux tranchants. Quoi qu’il en fût, Claquesous égaré ne se retrouva pas. Javert en parut plus irrité qu’étonné.","Finally, on the journey from the Gorbeau hovel to La Force, one of the principal arrested, Claquesous, had got lost. No one knew how it had happened, the agents and sergeants ""didn't understand a thing about it"", it had turned into vapor, it had slipped between thumbs, it had sunk between the cracks of the car, the cab was cracked and had leaked; we didn't know what to say, except that when we got to the prison, there would be no more Claquesous. There was magic there, or police. Had Claquesous melted into the darkness like a snowflake through water? Had there been unacknowledged connivance of the agents? Did this man belong to the double enigma of disorder and order? Was he concentric with offense and repression? Did this sphinx have its front legs in crime and its hind legs in authority? Javert did not accept such combinations, and would have bristled before such compromises; but his squad included other inspectors than himself, more initiated perhaps than himself, although his subordinates, in the secrets of the prefecture, and Claquesous was such a villain that he could be a very good agent. To be in such close conspiratorial relations with the night is excellent for robbery and admirable for the police. There are these two-edged rascals. Be that as it may, the lost Claquesous did not find himself. Javert seemed more irritated than surprised.","Finally, on the way from the Gorbeau tenement to La Force, one of the chief arrests made, Claquesous, vanished. No one knew how it had happened, the police who were with him were ‘completely baffled’, he had vaporized, slipped out of the thumb-cuffs and slithered through chinks in the carriage – the cab was cracked, and it leaked. All they could say was that when they got to the prison Claquesous was gone. It was either a case of magic or the police had something to do with it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snowflake in water? Had there been some unavowed connivance with his custodians? Was this man part of the dual enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric to both law-breaking and law enforcement? Did this sphinx have his forelimbs in crime and his hindlimbs in authority? Javert did not approve of arrangements of this kind and would have taken exception to such a compromise. But his squad included other inspectors besides himself, and they were perhaps, although his subordinates, more initiated than he was into the secrets of the Prefecture. And Claquesous was such a villain, he might make a very good agent. To feel so much at home in the dark as to be able to elude detection is excellent for robbers and admirable for the police. Such double-dealers do exist. All the same, having gone missing, Claquesous was not tracked down again. Javert appeared to be more annoyed than surprised by this.","And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of the principal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how this had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants “could not understand it at all.” He had converted himself into vapor, he had slipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they were able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with infraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and would have bristled up against such compromises; but his squad included other inspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he, perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent. It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night. These double-edged rascals do exist. However that may be, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found again. Javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this.","Finally, on the trip from the Gorbeau tenement to La Force, one of the principal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. Nobody knew how it was done, the officers and sergeants “didn’t understand it,” he had changed into vapour, he had glided out of the handcuffs, he had slipped through the cracks of the carriage, the fiacre was leaky, and had fled; nothing could be said, save that on reaching the prison there was no Claquesous. There were either fairies or police in the matter. Had Claquesous melted away into the darkness like a snowflake in the water? Was there some secret connivance of the officers? Did this man belong to the double enigma of disorder and of order? Was he concentric with infraction and with repression? Had this sphinx forepaws in crime and hind-paws in authority? Javert in no wise accepted these combinations, and his hair rose on end in view of such an exposure; but his squad contained other inspectors besides himself, more deeply initiated, perhaps, than himself, although his subordinates, in the secrets of the prefecture, and Claquesous was so great a scoundrel that he might be a very good officer. To be on such intimate juggling relations with darkness is excellent for brigandage and admirable for the police. There are such two-edged rascals. However it might be, Claquesous was lost, and was not found again. Javert appeared more irritated than astonished at it."

"Feuilly était un ouvrier éventailliste, orphelin de père et de mère, qui gagnait péniblement trois francs par jour, et qui n’avait qu’une pensée, délivrer le monde. Il avait une autre préoccupation encore : s’instruire ; ce qu’il appelait aussi se délivrer. Il s’était enseigné à lui-même à lire et à écrire ; tout ce qu’il savait, il l’avait appris seul. Feuilly était un généreux cœur. Il avait l’embrassement immense. Cet orphelin avait adopté les peuples. Sa mère lui manquant, il avait médité sur la patrie. Il ne voulait pas qu’il y eût sur la terre un homme qui fût sans patrie. Il couvait en lui-même, avec la divination profonde de l’homme du peuple, ce que nous appelons aujourd’hui l’idée des nationalités.

Il avait pour spécialité la Grèce, la Pologne, la Hongrie, la Roumanie, l’Italie. Il prononçait ces noms-là sans cesse, à propos et hors de propos, avec la ténacité du droit. La Turquie sur la Grèce et la Thessalie, la Russie sur Varsovie, l’Autriche sur Venise, ces viols l’exaspéraient. Entre toutes, la grande voie de fait de 1772 le soulevait. Le vrai dans l’indignation, il n’y a pas de plus souveraine éloquence, il était éloquent de cette éloquence-là. Il ne tarissait pas sur cette date infâme, 1772, sur ce noble et vaillant peuple supprimé par trahison, sur ce crime à trois, sur ce guet-apens monstre, prototype et patron de toutes ces effrayantes suppressions d’états qui, depuis, ont frappé plusieurs nobles nations, et leur ont, pour ainsi dire, raturé leur acte de naissance. Tous les attentats sociaux contemporains dérivent du partage de la Pologne. Le partage de la Pologne est un théorème dont tous les forfaits politiques actuels sont les corollaires. Pas un despote, pas un traître, depuis tout à l’heure un siècle, qui n’ait visé, homologué, contre-signé, et paraphé, ne varietur, le partage de la Pologne. Quand on compulse le dossier des trahisons modernes, celle-là apparaît la première. Le congrès de Vienne a consulté ce crime avant de consommer le sien. 1772 sonne l’hallali, 1815 est la curée. Tel était le texte habituel de Feuilly. Ce pauvre ouvrier s’était fait le tuteur de la justice, et elle le récompensait en le faisant grand. C’est qu’en effet il y a de l’éternité dans le droit. Varsovie ne peut pas plus être tartare que Venise ne peut être tudesque. Les rois y perdent leur peine et leur honneur. Tôt ou tard, la patrie submergée flotte à la surface et reparaît. La Grèce redevient la Grèce, l’Italie redevient l’Italie. La protestation du droit contre le fait persiste à jamais. Le vol d’un peuple ne se prescrit pas. Ces hautes escroqueries n’ont point d’avenir. On ne démarque pas une nation comme un mouchoir.","Feuilly was a fan-maker, orphan of father and mother, who painfully earned three francs a day, and who had only one thought, to deliver the world. He had yet another preoccupation: to educate himself; what he also called getting rid of. He had taught himself to read and write; everything he knew he had learned alone. Feuilly was a generous heart. He had a huge embrace. This orphan had adopted the peoples. Missing his mother, he had meditated on his country. He did not want there to be a man on earth who was without a country. It brooded within itself, with the profound divination of the man of the people, what we call today the idea of nationalities. He had learned the story on purpose to become knowingly outraged. In this young circle of utopians, especially occupied with France, he represented the outside world. He specialized in Greece, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Italy. He uttered those names incessantly, appropriately and out of place, with the tenacity of justice. Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, Russia on Warsaw, Austria on Venice, these rapes exasperated him. Above all, the great assault of 1772 upset him. The truth in indignation, there is no more sovereign eloquence, he was eloquent with that eloquence. He never stopped talking about this infamous date, 1772, about this noble and valiant people suppressed by treason, about this crime à trois, about this monster ambush, prototype and patron of all these frightful suppressions of states which, since then, have struck several noble nations, and have, so to speak, crossed out their birth certificates. All contemporary social attacks derive from the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all the current political packages are the corollaries. Not a despot, not a traitor, for a century now, who has not aimed, homologated, countersigned, and initialed, ne varietur, the partition of Poland. When we examine the file of modern betrayals, this one appears first. The Congress of Vienna consulted this crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounds the hallali, 1815 is the quarry. Such was the usual text of Feuilly. This poor workman had made himself the tutor of justice, and she rewarded him by making him great. It is because there is indeed eternity in law. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be tudesque. Kings lose their pain and their honor. Sooner or later, the submerged homeland floats to the surface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy becomes Italy again. The protest of right against fact persists forever. The theft of a people cannot be prescribed. These high swindles have no future. You don't demarcate a nation like a handkerchief.","Feuilly was a fan-maker, an orphan without father or mother, who earned three francs a day for his toil and had but one thought: to free the world. He had one other preoccupation: to educate himself, which he also termed ‘to free himself’. He had taught himself to read and write. Everything he knew he had taught himself. Feuilly was big-hearted. He had a huge embrace. This orphan had adopted nations. In the absence of his mother, his thoughts had dwelt on the motherland. He did not want any man on earth to be without a motherland. With the man of the people’s profound and prophetic instinct he nurtured within himself what we now call the idea of national identity. He had studied history with the express purpose of being able to cry scandal in full possession of the facts. In this club of young Utopians mainly concerned with France, he represented the outside world. He had expert knowledge of Greece, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Italy. He was always bringing up these names, in and out of season, with the persistence of rightfulness. The assaults of Turkey on Crete and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, incensed him. That great iniquity of 1772 roused him above all others. There is no eloquence more supreme than righteous indignation, and that was the kind of eloquence he had. He was always talking about that infamous date 1772, about that noble and valiant people overcome by treachery, about that tripartite crime, about that monstrous attack – prototype and model for all those dreadful eliminations of states that have since struck down many a noble nation and, as it were, annulled their birth certificates. All today’s social outrages derive from the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present political crimes are the corollaries. Not a despot or a traitor for nearly a century who has not examined, endorsed, countersigned and initialled, ne varietur *, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern treacheries is examined, this one comes first. The Congress of Vienna took account of this crime before perpetrating its own. The year 1772 was the kill, 1815 the division of the spoils. This was Feuilly’s usual theme. This poor worker had made himself the guardian of justice, and justice rewarded him by making him great. For the fact is, there is perpetuity in rightfulness. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teutonic. Monarchs waste their efforts and lose their honour in the enterprise. Sooner or later the submerged nation floats to the surface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. Rightfulness is everlastingly persistent in its protest against such doings. There is no statute of limitation on the theft of a nation. These great swindles have no future. A nation’s identity cannot be removed like the initials from a pocket handkerchief.","Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but one thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned by himself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was immense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the idea of the nationality, had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had for his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things, the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time, have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of birth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, ne variatur, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the first thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly’s habitual text. This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.","Feuilly was a fan-maker, an orphan, who with difficulty earned three francs a day, and who had but one thought, to deliver the world. He had still another desire—to instruct himself; which he also called deliverance. He had taught himself to read and write; all that he knew, he had learned alone. Feuilly was a generous heart. He had an immense embrace. This orphan had adopted the people. Being without a mother, he had meditated upon his mother country. He was not willing that there should be any man upon the earth without a country. He nurtured within himself, with the deep divination of the man of the people, what we now call the idea of nationality. He had learned history expressly that he might base his indignation upon a knowledge of its cause. In this new upper room of utopists particularly interested in France, he represented the foreign nations. His specialty was Greece, Poland, Hungary, the Danubian Provinces, and Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, in season and out of season, with the tenacity of the right. Turkey upon Greece and Thessaly, Russia upon Warsaw, Austria upon Venice, these violations exasperated him. The grand highway robbery of 1772 excited him above all. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the truth in indignation; he was eloquent with this eloquence. He was never done with that infamous date, 1772, that noble and valiant people blotted out by treachery, that threefold crime, that monstrous ambuscade, prototype and pattern of all those terrible suppressions of states which, since, have stricken several noble nations, and have, so to say, erased the record of their birth. All the contemporary assaults upon society date from the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all the present political crimes are corollaries. Not a despot, not a traitor, for a century past, who has not viséd, confirmed, counter-signed, and set his initials to, ne varietur, the partition of Poland. When you examine the list of modern treasons, that appears first of all. The Congress of Vienna took advice of this crime before consummating its own. The halloo was sounded by 1772, 1815 is the quarry. Such was the usual text of Feuilly. This poor working man had made himself a teacher of justice, and she rewarded him by making him grand. For there is in fact eternity in the right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teutonic. The kings lose their labour at this, and their honour. Sooner or later, the submerged country floats to the surface and reappears. Greece again becomes Greece, Italy again becomes Italy. The protest of the right against the fact, persists forever. The robbery of a people never becomes prescriptive. These lofty swindles have no future. You cannot pick the mark out of a nation as you can out of a handerkerchief."

"Il quitta la rue Mouffetard, et Marius le vit entrer dans une des plus affreuses bicoques de la rue Gracieuse, il y resta un quart d’heure environ, puis revint rue Mouffetard. Il s’arrêta chez un quincaillier qu’il y avait à cette époque au coin de la rue Pierre-Lombard, et, quelques minutes après, Marius le vit sortir de la boutique, tenant à la main un grand ciseau à froid emmanché de bois blanc qu’il cacha sous sa redingote. A la hauteur de la rue du Petit-Gentilly, il tourna à gauche et gagna rapidement la rue du Petit-Banquier. Le jour tombait, la neige qui avait cessé un moment venait de recommencer, Marius s’embusqua au coin même de la rue du Petit-Banquier qui était déserte comme toujours, et il n’y suivit pas Jondrette. Bien lui en prit, car, parvenu près du mur bas où Marius avait entendu parler l’homme chevelu et l’homme barbu, Jondrette se retourna, s’assura que personne ne le suivait et ne le voyait, puis enjamba le mur et disparut.","He left the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him go into one of the most dreadful shacks in the Rue Gracieuse. He remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He stopped at a hardware store which there was at that time at the corner of the rue Pierre-Lombard, and, a few minutes later, Marius saw him come out of the shop, holding in his hand a large cold chisel with a wooden handle. white which he hid under his frock coat. At the height of the rue du Petit-Gentilly, he turned left and quickly reached the rue du Petit-Banquier. Day was falling, the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again, Marius took cover at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted as always, and he did not follow Jondrette there. Good luck to him, for, having reached the low wall where Marius had heard the hairy man and the bearded man speak, Jondrette turned around, made sure that no one was following him and saw him, then climbed over the wall and disappeared. .","He left Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him go inside one of the most dreadful hovels on Rue Gracieuse. He remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to Rue Mouffetard. He stopped at an ironmonger’s that there used to be in those days on the corner of Rue Pierre-Lombard – and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a big cold chisel with a plain wooden handle, which he secreted under his overcoat. When he came to Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned left and quickly reached Rue du Petit-Banquier. Daylight was fading. The snow, which had let up for a while, had just started falling again. Right at the corner of Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted as usual, Marius held back out of sight and did not follow Jondrette down the street. Just as well, because when Jondrette came alongside the low wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man talking he turned round to make sure no one was following him, and he did not see Marius. He then leapt over the wall and disappeared.","He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger’s shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.","He left the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him go into one of the most wretched places on the Rue Gracieuse; he stayed there about a quarter of an hour, and then returned to the Rue Mouffetard.

At the upper end of the Rue de Petit Gentilly, he turned to the left and walked rapidly to the Rue du Petit Banquier. Night was falling; the snow which had ceased to fall for a moment was beginning again; Marius hid just at the corner of the Rue du Petit Banquier, which was solitary, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette further. It was fortunate that he did, for, on reaching the low wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man talking, Jondrette turned around, made sure that nobody was following him or saw him, then stepped over the wall, and disappeared."

This is the case with passive natures. She had never been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear away the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to her. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret.

The countryside of Rome is one idea, the suburbs of Paris another; to see in what a horizon offers us nothing but fields, houses or trees, is to remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The place where a plain meets a city is always imbued with who knows what penetrating melancholy. Nature and humanity speak to you at the same time. The local originalities appear there.","Hardly anyone on earth is familiar with these strange places – Glacière, Cunette, Grenelle’s ghastly wall riddled with bullets, Mont-Parnasse, Fosse-aux-Loups, Les Aubiers on the banks of the Marne, Montsouris, Tombe-Issoire, Pierre-Plate at Châtillon where there is an old exhausted quarry, now used only for growing mushrooms and closed off at ground level by a trap-door of rotten planks. The Roman campagna is one concept, the outskirts of Paris another. To see in a landscape nothing but fields, houses or trees is to see only the surface. All aspects of things are notions of God. The place where a plain meets a city is always steeped in some indefinable pervasive melancholy. Nature and humanity speak to you simultaneously there. Local peculiarities become evident.","There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle all speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on the bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate de Châtillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a level with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of Rome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing but fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is to remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there. Local originalities there make their appearance.","There is hardly anybody but knows those singular places, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle spotted with balls, the Mont Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, the white hazel trees on the high banks of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre Plate de Chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which is of no further use but as a place for the growth of mushrooms, and is closed on a level with the ground by a trap-door of rotten boards. The Campagna of Rome is one idea; the banlieue of Paris is another; to see in whatever forms our horizon, nothing but fields, houses, or trees, is to be but superficial; all the aspects of things are thoughts of God. The place where an open plain adjoins a city always bears the impress of some indescribable, penetrating melancholy. There, nature and humanity address you at one and the same moment. There, the originalities of place appear."

"Alors il expliqua à Jean Valjean que c’était une récompense pour un service que lui, Fauchelevent, rendait à la communauté. Qu’il entrait dans ses attributions de participer aux sépultures, qu’il clouait les bières et assistait le fossoyeur au cimetière. Que la religieuse morte le matin avait demandé d’être ensevelie dans le cercueil qui lui servait de lit et enterrée dans le caveau sous l’autel de la chapelle. Que cela était défendu par les règlements de police, mais que c’était une de ces mortes à qui l’on ne refuse rien. Que la prieure et les mères vocales entendaient exécuter le vœu de la défunte. Que tant pis pour le gouvernement. Que lui Fauchelevent clouerait le cercueil dans la cellule, lèverait la pierre dans la chapelle, et descendrait la morte dans le caveau. Et que, pour le remercier, la prieure admettait dans la maison son frère comme jardinier et sa nièce comme pensionnaire. Que son frère, c’était M. Madeleine, et que sa nièce c’était Cosette. Que la prieure lui avait dit d’amener son frère le lendemain soir, après l’enterrement postiche au cimetière. Mais qu’il ne pouvait pas amener du dehors M. Madeleine, si M. Madeleine n’était pas dehors. Que c’était là le premier embarras. Et puis qu’il avait encore un embarras, la bière vide.","So he explained to Jean Valjean that it was a reward for a service that he, Fauchelevent, rendered to the community. That it was part of his duties to participate in the burials, that he nailed the coffins and assisted the gravedigger in the cemetery. That the nun who died that morning had asked to be buried in the coffin which served as her bed and buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel. That it was forbidden by police regulations, but that she was one of those dead women to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to carry out the wish of the deceased. Too bad for the government. That Fauchelevent would nail the coffin in the cell, lift the stone in the chapel, and lower the dead woman into the vault. And that, to thank him, the prioress admitted her brother to the house as gardener and her niece as boarder. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That the prioress had told her to bring her brother the next evening, after the artificial burial at the cemetery. But that he could not bring M. Madeleine from outside if M. Madeleine was not outside. That was the first embarrassment. And then he still had an embarrassment, the empty beer.","Then he explained to Jean Valjean that it was a reward for a favour he, Fauchelevent, was doing the community.

That this was forbidden by police regulations, but she was one of those dead to whom nothing is denied. That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the deceased’s wishes. Never mind about the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail down the coffin in the side room, lift the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the crypt. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to allow his brother into the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil. That his brother was Monsieur Madeleine, and his niece was Cosette. That the prioress had told him to bring his brother the following evening, after the fake burial in the cemetery. But he could not bring Monsieur Madeleine in from outside if Monsieur Madeleine was not outside. That was the first problem.

"Pour que Marius en vînt à cette situation florissante, il avait fallu des années. Années rudes ; difficiles, les unes à traverser, les autres à gravir. Marius n’avait point failli un seul jour. Il avait tout subi, en fait de dénûment ; il avait tout fait, excepté des dettes. Il se rendait ce témoignage que jamais il n’avait dû un sou à personne. Pour lui, une dette, c’était le commencement de l’esclavage. Il se disait même qu’un créancier est pire qu’un maître ; car un maître ne possède que votre personne, un créancier possède votre dignité et peut la souffleter. Plutôt que d’emprunter il ne mangeait pas. Il avait eu beaucoup de jours de jeûne. Sentant que toutes les extrémités se touchent et que, si l’on n’y prend garde, l’abaissement de fortune peut mener à la bassesse d’âme, il veillait jalousement sur sa fierté. Telle formule ou telle démarche qui, dans toute autre situation, lui eût paru déférence, lui semblait platitude, et il se redressait. Il ne hasardait rien, ne voulant pas reculer. Il avait sur le visage une sorte de rougeur sévère. Il était timide jusqu’à l’âpreté.","For Marius to come to this flourishing situation, it had taken years. Rough years; difficult, some to cross, others to climb. Marius had not failed a single day. He had suffered everything, in fact of destitution; he had done everything except debts. He bore witness to himself that he had never owed a penny to anyone. For him, a debt was the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself that a creditor is worse than a master; for a master possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your dignity and can strike it down. Rather than borrow he did not eat. He had had many days of fasting. Feeling that all ends touch and that, if we are not careful, abasement of fortune can lead to baseness of soul, he jealously guarded his pride. Such a formula or such a step which, in any other situation, would have seemed to him deference, seemed to him flatness, and he straightened up. He was risking nothing, not wanting to back down. He had a sort of severe blush on his face. He was shy to the bitterness.","It had taken years for Marius to reach this flourishing state. Arduous years: difficult to get through, some of them, others difficult to get over. Not for a single day had Marius faltered. He had suffered everything in the way of privation. He had done everything except contract debts. He said in his own favour that he had never owed anyone a sou. To him, a debt was the beginning of slavery. He even told himself that a creditor is worse than a master, for the master is master only of your person whereas a creditor is master of your dignity and can give it a beating. Rather than borrow, he did not eat. There were many days when he had gone hungry. Sensing that all extremes are akin, and that, if you are not careful, being down on your luck can lead to low-mindedness, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Some formality of expression or behaviour that in any other situation would have seemed to him polite, now seemed to him servile, and he bridled at it. He ventured nothing, not wanting to back down. There was in his face a kind of austere flush. He was shy even to the point of rudeness.","It had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing condition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. Marius had not failed for a single day.

A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery.

Such and such a formality or action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemed insipidity, and he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort of severe flush. He was timid even to rudeness.","For Marius to arrive at this flourishing condition had required years. Hard years, and difficult ones; those to get through, these to climb. Marius had never given up for a single day.

"Il avait eu des prix en son enfance au collège de Moulins où il était né, et il avait été couronné de la main du duc de Nivernais qu’il appelait le duc de Nevers. Ni la Convention, ni la mort de Louis XVI, ni Napoléon, ni le retour des Bourbons, rien n’avait pu effacer le souvenir de ce couronnement. Le duc de Nevers était pour lui la grande figure du siècle. Quel charmant grand seigneur, disait-il, et qu’il avait bon air avec son cordon bleu ! Aux yeux de M. Gillenormand, Catherine II avait réparé le crime du partage de la Pologne en achetant pour trois mille roubles le secret de l’élixir d’or à Bestuchef. Là-dessus, il s’animait : ― L’élixir d’or, s’écriait-il, la teinture jaune de Bestuchef, les gouttes du général Lamotte, c’était au dix-huitième siècle, à un louis le flacon d’une demi-once, le grand remède aux catastrophes de l’amour, la panacée contre Vénus. Louis XV en envoyait deux cents flacons au pape. — On l’eût fort exaspéré et mis hors des gonds si on lui eût dit que l’élixir d’or n’est autre chose que le perchlorure de fer. M. Gillenormand adorait les Bourbons et avait en horreur 1789 ; il racontait sans cesse de quelle façon il s’était sauvé dans la Terreur, et comment il lui avait fallu bien de la gaîté et bien de l’esprit pour ne pas avoir la tête coupée. Si quelque jeune homme s’avisait de faire devant lui l’éloge de la république, il devenait bleu et s’irritait à s’évanouir. Quelquefois il faisait allusion à son âge de quatrevingt-dix ans, et disait : J’espère bien que je ne verrai pas deux fois quatrevingt-treize. D’autres fois, il signifiait aux gens qu’il entendait vivre cent ans.","He had received prizes in his childhood at the college of Moulins where he was born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duke of Nivernais, whom he called the Duke of Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death of Louis XVI, nor Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nothing had been able to erase the memory of this coronation. The Duke of Nevers was for him the great figure of the century. What a charming grand seigneur, he said, and how well he looked with his blue ribbon! In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine II had repaired the crime of the partition of Poland by buying for three thousand rubles the secret of the elixir of gold at Bestuchef. Thereupon he grew animated: ""The elixir of gold,"" he exclaimed, ""Bestuchef's yellow tincture, General Lamotte's drops, those were in the eighteenth century, at one louis a bottle of half an ounce, the great remedy for the disasters of love, the panacea against Venus. Louis XV sent two hundred bottles of it to the Pope. ""He would have been greatly exasperated and thrown off the hook if he had been told that the elixir of gold is nothing but perchloride of iron."" M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons and had a horror of 1789; he constantly told how he had saved himself in the Terror, and how it had needed a lot of gaiety and a lot of wit not to have his head cut off. If any young man took it into his head to eulogize the republic in his presence, he would turn blue and irritated himself until he fainted. Sometimes he alluded to his age of ninety, and said: I hope I shall not see ninety-three twice.

Louis XV sent two hundred phials of it to the pope.’ He would have been greatly provoked and would have flown into a rage if he had been told that the elixir of gold is nothing but ferric chloride. Monsieur Gillenormand adored the Bourbons and abhorred 1789. He was forever relating how he had escaped during the Terror and how it took a great deal of jollity and a great deal of wit to avoid having his head cut off. If any young man ventured to acclaim the Republic in his presence, he would turn blue and almost faint in his fury.

"M. Mabeuf s’était mis à feuilleter et à lire, à l’aide de ses lunettes, deux livres qui le passionnaient, et même, chose plus grave à son âge, le préoccupaient. Sa timidité naturelle le rendait propre à une certaine acceptation des superstitions. Le premier de ces livres était le fameux traité du président Delancre, De l’inconstance des démons, l’autre était l’in-quarto de Mutor de la Rubaudière, Sur les diables de Vauvert et les gobelins de la Bièvre. Ce dernier bouquin l’intéressait d’autant plus que son jardin avait été un des terrains anciennement hantés par les gobelins. Le crépuscule commençait à blanchir ce qui est en haut et à noircir ce qui est en bas. Tout en lisant, et par-dessus le livre qu’il tenait à la main, le père Mabeuf considérait ses plantes et entre autres un rhododendron magnifique qui était une de ses consolations ; quatre jours de hâle, de vent et de soleil, sans une goutte de pluie, venaient de passer ; les tiges se courbaient, les boutons penchaient, les feuilles tombaient, tout cela avait besoin d’être arrosé ; le rhododendron surtout était triste. Le père Mabeuf était de ceux pour qui les plantes ont des âmes. Le vieillard avait travaillé toute la journée à son carré d’indigo, il était épuisé de fatigue, il se leva pourtant, posa ses livres sur le banc, et marcha tout courbé et à pas chancelants jusqu’au puits, mais quand il eut saisi la chaîne, il ne put même pas la tirer assez pour la décrocher.

This last book interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the grounds formerly haunted by goblins. The twilight was beginning to whiten what is above and blacken what is below. While reading, and over the book he held in his hand, Father Mabeuf considered his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind and sun, without a drop of rain, had just passed; the stems were bending, the buds bent, the leaves were falling, it all needed watering; the rhododendron especially was sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those for whom plants have souls. The old man had worked all day at his indigo square, he was exhausted with fatigue, he however got up, put his books on the bench, and walked bent over and with staggering steps as far as the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he couldn't even pull it enough to unhook it.

Stems were sagging, buds drooping, leaves falling, everything needed watering – the rhododendron looked particularly sad. Père Mabeuf was one of those for whom plants have souls. The old man had laboured all day at his indigo plot, he was utterly exhausted, but he stood up, laid his books on the bench, and all stooped and unsteady on his feet he tottered over to the well; but when he had grasped the chain he could not even pull it hard enough to unhook it. Then he turned and looked up in anguish towards the sky, which was filling with stars.","M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, De l’Inconstance des Démons; the other was a quarto by Mutor de la Rubaudière, Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bièvre. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more, because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose, laid his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.","M. Mabeuf had begun to look through, reading by the way, with the help of his spectacles, two books which enchanted him, and in which he was even absorbed, a more serious thing at his age. His natural timidity fitted him, to a certain extent, to accept superstitions. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, On the inconstancy of Demons, the other was the quarto of Mutor de la Rubaudière, On the devils of Vauvert and the goblins of La Bièvé. This last book interested him the more, since his garden was one of the spots formerly haunted by goblins. Twilight was beginning to whiten all above and to blacken all below. As he read, Father Mabeuf was looking over the book which he held in his hand, at his plants, and among others at a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; there had been four days of drought, wind, and sun, without a drop of rain; the stalks bent over, the buds hung down, the leaves were falling, they all needed to be watered; the rhododendron especially was a sad sight. Father Mabeuf was one of those to whom plants have souls. The old man had worked all day on his indigo bed, he was exhausted with fatigue, he got up nevertheless, put his books upon the bench, and walked, bent over and with tottering steps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could not even draw it far enough to unhook it. Then he turned and looked with a look of anguish towards the sky which was filling with stars."

"Les chocs des jeunes esprits entre eux ont cela d’admirable qu’on ne peut jamais prévoir l’étincelle ni deviner l’éclair. Que va-t-il jaillir tout à l’heure ? on l’ignore.

"Pendant que Jondrette parlait, avec une sorte de désordre apparent qui n’ôtait rien à l’expression réfléchie et sagace de sa physionomie, Marius leva les yeux et aperçut au fond de la chambre quelqu’un qu’il n’avait pas encore vu. Un homme venait d’entrer, si doucement qu’on n’avait pas entendu tourner les gonds de la porte. Cet homme avait un gilet de tricot violet, vieux, usé, taché, coupé et faisant des bouches ouvertes à tous ses plis, un large pantalon de velours de coton, des chaussons à sabots aux pieds, pas de chemise, le cou nu, les bras nus et tatoués, et le visage barbouillé de noir. Il s’était assis en silence et les bras croisés sur le lit le plus voisin, et, comme il se tenait derrière la Jondrette, on ne le distinguait que confusément.","While Jondrette was talking, with a sort of apparent disorder which took nothing away from the thoughtful and shrewd expression of his countenance, Marius raised his eyes and perceived at the back of the room someone whom he had not yet seen. .

This man had on an old, worn, stained, cut and open-mouthed purple knitted waistcoat at all its folds, wide cotton corduroy trousers, clog slippers on his feet, no shirt, bare neck, bare, tattooed arms, and a face smeared in black. He had sat down in silence with his arms folded on the nearest bed, and, as he was standing behind La Jondrette, he could only be made out vaguely.","While Jondrette was talking, with an apparent incoherence of sorts that in no way detracted from the shrewd and thoughtful expression of his physiognomy, Marius looked up and noticed at the far end of the room someone he had not seen before. A man had just entered so quietly , there had been no sound of the door opening. This man wore a purple knitted waistcoat – old, threadbare, stained, torn and gaping at every fold – wide velveteen trousers, wooden clogs on his feet, and no shirt. He was bare-necked, with bare tattooed arms and black-smeared face. He had sat down, in silence and with his arms folded, on the nearest bed, and since he was behind Jondrette he could be seen only indistinctly.","While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.","While Jondrette was talking, with an apparent disorder which detracted nothing from the crafty and cunning expression of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the back of the room somebody whom he had not before seen.

This man had a knit woollen waistcoat of violet colour, old, worn-out, stained, cut, and showing gaps at all its folds, full trousers of cotton velvet, socks on his feet, no shirt, his neck bare, his arms bare and tattooed, and his face stained black.

"Le jour où M. Mabeuf disait à Marius : Certainement, j’approuve les opinions politiques, il exprimait le véritable état de son esprit. Toutes les opinions politiques lui étaient indifférentes, et il les approuvait toutes sans distinguer, pour qu’elles le laissassent tranquille, comme les grecs appelaient les Furies « les belles, les bonnes, les charmantes », les Euménides. M. Mabeuf avait pour opinion politique d’aimer passionnément les plantes, et surtout les livres. Il possédait comme tout le monde sa terminaison en iste, sans laquelle personne n’aurait pu vivre en ce temps-là, mais il n’était ni royaliste, ni bonapartiste, ni chartiste, ni orléaniste, ni anarchiste ; il était bouquiniste.","The day when M.

He had, like everyone else, his ending in iste, without which no one could have lived at that time, but he was neither a royalist, nor a Bonapartist, nor a Chartist, nor an Orleanist, nor anarchist; he was a bookseller.","Monsieur Mabeuf The day Monsieur Mabeuf said to Marius, ‘Of course I approve of political opinions’, he was expressing his true state of mind. All political opinions were alike to him, and he approved of them all indiscriminately, so that they would leave him in peace, in the same way that the Greeks called the Furies the Eumenides, ‘the beautiful ones, the kindly ones, the gracious ones’. Monsieur Mabeuf’s political opinion was his passionate love of plants, and especially of books. Like everyone else, he had his own -ist ending, without which no one could have existed at that time, but he was neither a royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an Orleanist or an anarchist – he was a book-specialist.","On the day when M.

All political opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approved them all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the Greeks called the Furies “the beautiful, the good, the charming,” the Eumenides. M. Mabeuf’s political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world, he possessed the termination in ist, without which no one could exist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist ; he was a bouquinist, a collector of old books.","M.

"Tout ce qui l’entourait, ce jardin paisible, ces fleurs embaumées, ces enfants poussant des cris joyeux, ces femmes graves et simples, ce cloître silencieux, le pénétraient lentement, et peu à peu son âme se composait de silence comme ce cloître, de parfum comme ces fleurs, de paix comme ce jardin, de simplicité comme ces femmes, de joie comme ces enfants. Et puis il songeait que c’étaient deux maisons de Dieu qui l’avaient successivement recueilli aux deux instants critiques de sa vie, la première lorsque toutes les portes se fermaient et que la société humaine le repoussait, la deuxième au moment où la société humaine se remettait à sa poursuite et où le bagne se rouvrait ; et que sans la première il serait retombé dans le crime et sans la seconde dans le supplice.","Everything around him, this peaceful garden, these fragrant flowers, these children uttering joyful cries, these grave and simple women, this silent cloister, penetrated him slowly, and little by little his soul was composed of silence like this cloister, of perfume like these flowers, of peace like this garden, of simplicity like these women, of joy like these children. And then he reflected that it was two houses of God which had successively taken him in at the two critical moments of his life, the first when all the doors were closing and human society was pushing him away, the second when human society resumed pursuit and where the penal colony reopened; and that without the first he would have fallen back into crime and without the second into torture.","He was slowly imbued with everything that surrounded him, this peaceful garden, these fragrant flowers, these children uttering joyful cries, these women of grave simplicity, this silent cloister, and little by little his soul became a creation of silence like this cloister, of perfume like these flowers, of peace like this garden, of simplicity like these women, of joy like these children. And then he reflected how it was two houses of God that had in turn taken him in at two critical moments in his life: the first when all doors were closed to him and human society rejected him, the second when human society started hounding him again and the prison hulks opened up before him once more. And that but for the first he would have fallen back into crime, and but for the second, back into torment.","Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrant flowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and simple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by little, his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume like the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children. And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life: the first, when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and that, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed into crime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.","Everything around him, this quiet garden, these balmy flowers, these children, shouting with joy, these meek and simple women, this silent cloister, gradually entered into all his being, and, little by little, his soul subsided into silence like this cloister, into fragrance like these flowers, into peace like this garden, into simplicity like these women, into joy like these children. And then he reflected that two houses of God had received him in succession at the two critical moments of his life, the first when every door was closed and human society repelled him; the second, when human society again howled upon his track, and the galleys once more gaped for him; and that, had it not been for the first, he should have fallen back into crime, and had it not been for the second, into punishment."
"Il se rappelait ses anciens compagnons ; comme ils étaient misérables ; ils se levaient dès l’aube et travaillaient jusqu’à la nuit ; à peine leur laissait-on le sommeil ; ils couchaient sur des lits de camp, où l’on ne leur tolérait que des matelas de deux pouces d’épaisseur, dans des salles qui n’étaient chauffées qu’aux mois les plus rudes de l’année ; ils étaient vêtus d’affreuses casaques rouges ; on leur permettait, par grâce, un pantalon de toile dans les grandes chaleurs et une roulière de laine sur le dos dans les grands froids ; ils ne buvaient de vin et ne mangeaient de viande que lorsqu’ils allaient « à la fatigue ».

As a concession they were allowed light trousers in the hot season and a woollen jacket in the cold season. They drank wine and ate meat only when they were ‘on a job’.

They had no wine to drink, no meat for food excepting when sent upon “extra hard work.” They lived without names, distinguished solely by numbers, and reduced, as it were, to ciphers, lowering their eyes, lowering their voices, with their hair cropped close, under the rod, and plunged in shame."

"― Si ! reprit le vieillard, je ne veux pas que vous ayez mauvaise idée de moi. Voyez-vous, je tiens à cette place. Il me semble que la messe y est meilleure. Pourquoi ? je vais vous le dire. C’est à cette place-là que j’ai vu venir pendant dix années, tous les deux ou trois mois régulièrement, un pauvre brave père qui n’avait pas d’autre occasion et pas d’autre manière de voir son enfant, parce que, pour des arrangements de famille, on l’en empêchait. Il venait à l’heure où il savait qu’on menait son fils à la messe. Le petit ne se doutait pas que son père était là. Il ne savait même peut-être pas qu’il avait un père, l’innocent ! Le père, lui, se tenait derrière un pilier pour qu’on ne le vît pas. Il regardait son enfant, et il pleurait. Il adorait ce petit, ce pauvre homme ! J’ai vu cela. Cet endroit est devenu comme sanctifié pour moi, et j’ai pris l’habitude de venir y entendre la messe. Je le préfère au banc d’œuvre où j’aurais droit d’être comme marguillier. J’ai même un peu connu ce malheureux monsieur. Il avait un beau-père, une tante riche, des parents, je ne sais plus trop, qui menaçaient de déshériter l’enfant si, lui le père, il le voyait. Il s’était sacrifié pour que son fils fût riche un jour et heureux. On l’en séparait pour opinion politique. Certainement j’approuve les opinions politiques, mais il y a des gens qui ne savent pas s’arrêter. Mon Dieu ! parce qu’un homme a été à Waterloo, ce n’est pas un monstre ; on ne sépare point pour cela un père de son enfant. C’était un colonel de Bonaparte. Il est mort, je crois. Il demeurait à Vernon où j’ai mon frère curé, et il s’appelait quelque chose comme Pontmarie ou Montpercy... ― Il avait, ma foi, un beau coup de sabre.","- Yes ! resumed the old man, I don't want you to have a bad idea of me. You see, I want this place. It seems to me that the mass is better there. Why ? I am going to tell you. It was to this place that I saw coming for ten years, regularly every two or three months, a poor brave father who had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child, because, for family arrangements, he was prevented from doing so. He came at a time when he knew that his son was being taken to mass. The child had no idea that his father was there. Maybe he didn't even know he had a father, the innocent! The father stood behind a pillar so that no one could see him. He was looking at his child, and he was crying. He adored this little, poor man! I seen that. This place has become sanctified for me, and I have got into the habit of coming to hear mass there. I prefer him to the bench where I would have the right to be as a churchwarden. I even knew this unfortunate gentleman a little. He had a father-in-law, a rich aunt, parents, I'm not sure who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He had sacrificed himself so that his son would one day be rich and happy. He was separated from it for political opinion. Certainly I approve of political opinions, but there are people who do not know how to stop. My God ! because a man has been to Waterloo, he is not a monster; one does not separate for that a father from his child. He was a Bonaparte colonel. He is dead, I believe. He lived in Vernon, where I have my brother, priest, and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy.","the old man went on. ‘I don’t want you to think ill of me. You see, I’m attached to this place. It seems to me the mass is better from here. Why? I’ll tell you. It was to this spot that I saw a poor man come regularly, every two or three months, for many years, a fine father who had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented from doing so under the terms of a family agreement. He used to come at the time when he knew his son would be brought to mass. The lad never suspected his father was there. Perhaps he didn’t even know he had a father, the little innocent! The father kept behind this pillar so he wouldn’t be seen. He would gaze at his child and weep. He adored that child, poor man! I could see that. For me this spot has become almost sanctified, and I’ve developed the habit of coming here to hear mass. I prefer it to the stall where, as warden, I have a right to be. I even got to know that unfortunate gentleman a little. He had a father-in-law, a rich aunt, relatives, I don’t quite remember, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself so that his son might some day be rich and happy. They were kept apart on account of political opinions. Certainly, I’m in favour of political opinions, but there are people who don’t know where to stop. My God! Just because a man was at Waterloo doesn’t make him a monster. You don’t keep a father away from his child for that. He was one of Bonaparte’s colonels. He’s now dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I have a brother who’s a priest, and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy – my goodness, he had a fine sabre scar.’","“Yes!” went on the old man, “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me.

I knew that unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don’t know exactly what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separated from him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one of Bonaparte’s colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a curé, and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy.","“Yes!” resumed the old man; “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me.

"Elle était décidément d’une beauté merveilleuse.

"En outre, au dehors, n’étant plus la révolution et devenant la monarchie, 1830 était obligé de prendre le pas de l’Europe. Garder la paix, surcroît de complication. Une harmonie voulue à contre-sens est souvent plus onéreuse qu’une guerre. De ce sourd conflit, toujours muselé, mais toujours grondant, naquit la paix armée, ce ruineux expédient de la civilisation suspecte à elle-même. La royauté de juillet se cabrait, malgré qu’elle en eût, dans l’attelage des cabinets européens. Metternich l’eût volontiers mise à la plate-longe. Poussée en France par le progrès, elle poussait en Europe les monarchies, ces tardigrades. Remorquée, elle remorquait.","Besides, outside, no longer being the revolution and becoming the monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence over Europe. Keeping the peace, added complication. A desired harmony in the opposite direction is often more expensive than a war. From this dull conflict, always muzzled, but always rumbling, was born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization suspect to itself. The royalty of July reared, despite having any, in the harness of the European cabinets. Metternich would gladly have put her on the lunge. Driven in France by progress, it pushed monarchies, those tardigrades, in Europe. Towed, she was towing.","Besides, in foreign affairs, now that it was revolution no longer and had become a monarchy, 1830 had to kowtow to Europe. Remaining at peace, that was an increased complication. A harmony that goes against the grain is often more onerous than a war. Out of this muted hostility, always kept muzzled but always growling, was born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of a self-doubting civilization. Whatever punishment it might incur, the July kingship bucked under the harness of the European governments. Metternich would gladly have hobbled it. Urged on in France by progress, in Europe it urged on those heel-dragging reactionaries, the monarchies. In tow, it towed.","In addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. To keep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war.

The Royalty of July reared up, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of European cabinets. Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in France by progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe. After having been towed, it undertook to tow.","Moreover, externally, being no longer the revolution, and becoming the monarchy, 1830 was obliged to keep step with Europe. To preserve peace, an increase of complication. A harmony required in the wrong way is often more onerous than a war.

― Éponine ! Comment savez-vous que je m’appelle Éponine ?,―Eponine! How do you know my name is Éponine?,‘Éponine! How do you know my name’s Éponine?’,“Éponine! How do you know that my name is Éponine?”,“Eponine! How do you know that my name is Eponine?”
"Du reste, ce sceptique avait un fanatisme. Ce fanatisme n’était ni une idée, ni un dogme, ni un art, ni une science ; c’était un homme, Enjolras. Grantaire admirait, aimait et vénérait Enjolras. A qui se ralliait ce douteur anarchique dans cette phalange d’esprits absolus ? Au plus absolu. De quelle façon Enjolras le subjuguait-il ? Par les idées ? Non. Par le caractère. Phénomène souvent observé. Un sceptique qui adhère à un croyant, cela est simple comme la loi des couleurs complémentaires. Ce qui nous manque nous attire. Personne n’aime le jour comme l’aveugle. La naine adore le tambour-major. Le crapaud a toujours les yeux au ciel ; pourquoi ? pour voir voler l’oiseau. Grantaire, en qui rampait le doute, aimait à voir dans Enjolras la foi planer. Il avait besoin d’Enjolras. Sans qu’il s’en rendît clairement compte et sans qu’il songeât à se l’expliquer à lui-même, cette nature chaste, saine, ferme, droite, dure, candide, le charmait. Il admirait, d’instinct, son contraire. Ses idées molles, fléchissantes, disloquées, malades, difformes, se rattachaient à Enjolras comme à une épine dorsale. Son rachis moral s’appuyait à cette fermeté. Grantaire, près d’Enjolras, redevenait quelqu’un. Il était lui-même d’ailleurs composé de deux éléments en apparence incompatibles. Il était ironique et cordial. Son indifférence aimait. Son esprit se passait de croyance et son cœur ne pouvait se passer d’amitié. Contradiction profonde ; car une affection est une conviction. Sa nature était ainsi. Il y a des hommes qui semblent nés pour être le verso, l’envers, le revers. Ils sont Pollux, Patrocle, Nisus, Eudamidas, Éphestion, Pechméja. Ils ne vivent qu’à la condition d’être adossés à un autre ; leur nom est une suite, et ne s’écrit que précédé de la conjonction et ; leur existence ne leur est pas propre ; elle est l’autre côté d’une destinée qui n’est pas la leur. Grantaire était un de ces hommes. Il était l’envers d’Enjolras.","Besides, this skeptic had a fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither an idea, nor a dogma, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man, Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved and revered Enjolras. To whom did this anarchic doubter rally in this phalanx of absolute minds? At most absolute. How did Enjolras subjugate him? By ideas? No. By character. Often observed phenomenon. A skeptic who adheres to a believer, it is as simple as the law of complementary colors. What we lack attracts us. No one loves the day like the blind. The dwarf adores the drum major. The toad always has its eyes in the sky; Why ? to see the bird fly. Grantaire, in whom doubt crept, liked to see faith hovering in Enjolras. He needed Enjolras. Without his realizing it clearly and without thinking of explaining it to himself, this chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmed him. He instinctively admired his opposite. His soft, weakening, dislocated, sick, deformed ideas were attached to Enjolras as to a backbone. His moral spine relied on this firmness. Grantaire, near Enjolras, became someone again. It was itself composed of two seemingly incompatible elements. He was ironic and cordial. His indifference loved. His mind was without belief and his heart could not be without friendship. Deep contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His nature was like that. There are men who seem born to be the reverse, the reverse, the reverse. They are Pollux, Patroclus, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They live only on the condition of being leaned against another; their name is a sequence, and is only written preceded by the conjunction and; their existence is not unique to them; it is the other side of a destiny that is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the other side of Enjolras.","However, this sceptic had one obsession. This obsession was not an idea, nor a dogma, nor an art, nor a science. It was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved and revered Enjolras. Which of this phalanx of absolutists did this doubting anarchist stand by? The most absolute. How did Enjolras enthral him? By his ideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon often observed. The sceptic attracted to the believer is as elementary as the law of complementary colours. We are drawn to what we lack. No one loves daylight as much as the blind man. The dwarfish girl idolizes the drum major. The toad’s eyes always look skyward. Why? To watch the bird in flight. With insidious doubt creeping through him, Grantaire loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He needed Enjolras. Without being clearly aware of it, and without any notion of explaining it to himself, he was spellbound by that chaste, wholesome, steadfast, honest, rigorous, straightforward nature. By instinct, he admired his opposite. His weak, flaccid, inconsistent, sickly, distorted ideas fastened on Enjolras as to a backbone. His moral feebleness relied on that firmness. In Enjolras’s company Grantaire once again became somebody. In fact he was himself made up of two apparently incompatible elements. He was ironic and he was well-meaning. His apathy cared. His mind dispensed with conviction but his heart could not do without friendship. A profound contradiction, for affection is belief. That was his nature. There are men who seemingly are born to be the verso, the inverse, the reverse. They are Pollux, Patroclus, Nisus, Eudamidas, Hephaestion, Pechméja. Their existence depends on being fronted by another man. Their names follow on and are never written without the conjunction ‘and’ in front of them. Their lives do not belong to them. They are the adjunct of a fate that is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the reverse of Enjolras.","However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his ideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His indifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his heart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunction and; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.","Still, this sceptic had a fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither an idea, nor a dogma, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this anarchical doubter ally himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what way did Enjolras subjugate him? By ideas? No. By a character. A phenomenon often seen. A sceptic adhering to a believer; that is as simple as the law of the complementary colours. What we lack attracts us. Nobody loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drummajor. The toad is always looking up at the sky; why? To see the bird fly. Grantaire, in whom doubt was creeping, loved to see faith soaring in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. Without understanding it himself clearly, and without trying to explain it, that chaste, healthy, firm, direct, hard, candid nature charmed him. He admired, by instinct, his opposite. His soft, wavering, disjointed, diseased, deformed ideas, attached themselves to Enjolras as to a backbone. His moral spine leaned upon that firmness. Grantaire, by the side of Enjolras, became somebody again. He was himself, moreover, composed of two apparently incompatible elements. He was ironical and cordial. His indifference was loving. His mind dispensed with belief, yet his heart could not dispense with friendship. A thorough contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His nature was so. There are men who seem born to be the opposite, the reverse, the counterpart. They are Pollux, Patroclus, Nisus, Eudamidas, Hephæstion, Pechméja. They live only upon condition of leaning on another; their names are continuations, and are only written preceded by the conjunction and; their existence is not their own; it is the other side of a destiny which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the reverse of Enjolras."
"― Mon épouse va revenir, ne vous impatientez pas. Je pense que l’Alouette est véritablement votre fille, et je trouve tout simple que vous la gardiez. Seulement, écoutez un peu. Avec votre lettre, ma femme ira la trouver. J’ai dit à ma femme de s’habiller, comme vous avez vu, de façon que votre demoiselle la suive sans difficulté. Elles monteront toutes deux dans le fiacre avec mon camarade derrière. Il y a quelque part en dehors d’une barrière une maringotte attelée de deux très bons chevaux. On y conduira votre demoiselle. Elle descendra du fiacre. Mon camarade montera avec elle dans la maringotte, et ma femme reviendra ici nous dire : C’est fait. Quant à votre demoiselle, on ne lui fera pas de mal, la maringotte la mènera dans un endroit où elle sera tranquille, et, dès que vous m’aurez donné les petits deux cent mille francs, on vous la rendra. Si vous me faites arrêter, mon camarade donnera le coup de pouce à l’Alouette. Voilà.","―My wife is coming back, don't be impatient. I think the Alouette is really your daughter, and I find it quite simple that you keep her. Just listen a little. With your letter, my wife will find her. I told my wife to dress, as you have seen, so that your young lady will follow her without difficulty. They will both get into the cab with my comrade behind. There is somewhere outside a barrier a maringotte harnessed by two very good horses. We'll take your young lady there. She will get out of the cab. My comrade will go up with her in the maringotte, and my wife will come back here to tell us: It's done. As for your young lady, we won't hurt her, the maringotte will lead her to a place where she will be quiet, and, as soon as you have given me the little two hundred thousand francs, we will give her back to you.

I told my wife to dress up, as you saw, so that your young lady would go along with her without any fuss. They’ll both get into the carriage with my colleague behind. Somewhere beyond the gate there’s a gig with two very good horses harnessed to it. Your young lady will be taken there. She’ll get out of the carriage. My colleague will get into the gig with her, and my wife’ll come back here to tell us it’s done. As for the young lady, no harm will come to her. The gig will take her somewhere safe and just as soon as you’ve given me the small sum of two hundred thousand francs she’ll be returned to you. If you have me arrested, my colleague will take care of Alouette. There you have it.’","“My wife will be back shortly, don’t get impatient. I think that the Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us: ‘It’s done.’ As for the young lady, no harm will be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that’s all.” The prisoner uttered not a syllable.","“My spouse is coming back, do not be impatient.

"― A Dieu ne plaise que je diminue la France ! mais ce n’est point la diminuer que de lui amalgamer Napoléon. Ah çà, parlons donc. Je suis nouveau venu parmi vous, mais je vous avoue que vous m’étonnez. Où en sommes-nous ? qui sommes-nous ? qui êtes-vous ? qui suis-je ? Expliquons-nous sur l’empereur. Je vous entends dire Buonaparte en accentuant l’u comme des royalistes. Je vous préviens que mon grand-père fait mieux encore ; il dit Buonaparté. Je vous croyais des jeunes gens. Où mettez-vous donc votre enthousiasme ? et qu’est-ce que vous en faites ? qui admirez-vous si vous n’admirez pas l’empereur ? et que vous faut-il de plus ? Si vous ne voulez pas de ce grand homme-là, de quels grands hommes voudrez-vous ? Il avait tout. Il était complet. Il avait dans son cerveau le cube des facultés humaines. Il faisait des codes comme Justinien, il dictait comme César, sa causerie mêlait l’éclair de Pascal au coup de foudre de Tacite, il faisait l’histoire et il l’écrivait, ses bulletins sont des iliades, il combinait le chiffre de Newton avec la métaphore de Mahomet, il laissait derrière lui dans l’orient des paroles grandes comme les pyramides ; à Tilsitt il enseignait la majesté aux empereurs, à l’académie des sciences il donnait la réplique à Laplace, au conseil d’état il tenait tête à Merlin, il donnait une âme à la géométrie des uns et à la chicane des autres, il était légiste avec les procureurs et sidéral avec les astronomes ; comme Cromwell soufflant une chandelle sur deux, il s’en allait au Temple marchander un gland de rideau ; il voyait tout, il savait tout ; ce qui ne l’empêchait pas de rire d’un rire bonhomme au berceau de son petit enfant ; et tout à coup, l’Europe effarée écoutait, des armées se mettaient en marche, des parcs d’artillerie roulaient, des ponts de bateaux s’allongeaient sur les fleuves, les nuées de la cavalerie galopaient dans l’ouragan, cris, trompettes, tremblement de trônes partout, les frontières des royaumes oscillaient sur la carte, on entendait le bruit d’un glaive surhumain qui sortait du fourreau, on le voyait, lui, se dresser debout sur l’horizon avec un flamboiement dans la main et un resplendissement dans les yeux, déployant dans le tonnerre ses deux ailes, la grande armée et la vieille garde, et c’était l’archange de la guerre !","―God forbid that I diminish France! but it is not diminishing it to amalgamate Napoleon with it. Oh, let's talk. I am new to you, but I confess that you surprise me. Where are we ? who are we ? who are you ? who am I ? Let's talk about the emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte accenting the u like royalists. I warn you that my grandfather does even better; he says Buonaparte. I thought you were young people. Where do you put your enthusiasm? and what do you do with it? who do you admire if you don't admire the emperor? and what more do you need? If you don't want that great man, what great men will you want? He had everything. He was full. He had in his brain the cube of human faculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like Caesar, his talk mixed Pascal's lightning bolt with Tacitus' thunderbolt, he made history and he wrote it down, his bulletins are iliads, he combined Newton's cipher with the metaphor of Mahomet, he left behind him in the East words as big as the pyramids; at Tilsitt he taught majesty to the emperors, at the academy of sciences he replied to Laplace, at the council of state he stood up to Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of some and the chicanery of others, he was forensic with prosecutors and sidereal with astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out every other candle, he went to the Temple to haggle over a curtain tassel; he saw everything, he knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughing a good-natured laugh at the cradle of his little child; and suddenly frightened Europe was listening, armies were marching, artillery parks were rolling, bridges of boats were stretching out over the rivers, the clouds of cavalry were galloping in the hurricane, cries, trumpets , trembling thrones everywhere, the borders of the kingdoms oscillated on the map, one heard the noise of a superhuman sword which left the scabbard, one saw him, standing upright on the horizon with a blaze in his hand and a splendor in the eyes, spreading in the thunder his two wings, the grand army and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!","He turned to Enjolras, and his voice rang with a quiver that came from a visceral contraction inside him: ‘God forbid I should belittle France! But to identify Napoleon with her is not to belittle her. Come, let’s talk. I’m a newcomer among you but I confess you amaze me. Where do we stand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let’s discuss the emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the u like the royalists. I warn you, my grandfather goes one better. He says “Buonaparté”. I thought you people were young. So where’s your fervour? And what are you doing with it? Whom do you admire if you don’t admire the emperor? And what more do you want? If you won’t accept that great man, which great men will you accept? He had everything. He lacked nothing. His brain contained normal human faculties to the power of three. He was Justinian in law-making, he ruled with Caesar’s authority, his conversation combined Pascal’s lightning wit with the mighty thunder of Tacitus. He made history, and wrote it. His bulletins are Iliads. He combined Newton’s mathematics with Mohammed’s metaphors. In the East, he left behind words as great as the pyramids. At Tilsit he taught emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he challenged Laplace, in the Council of State he held his own against Merlin. He brought soul to the geometry of some and to the pettifogging of others. He was a jurist with lawyers and a star-gazer with astronomers. Like Cromwell blowing out every other candle, he went off to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel. He saw everything, he knew everything. Which did not prevent him, at his little child’s cradle, from laughing with simple fatherly delight. And all at once Europe listened in alarm, armies went on the march, artillery parks mobilized, pontoon bridges extended across rivers, hosts of cavalry went galloping into the storm, everywhere cries, trumpets, thrones trembling; on the map the frontiers of kingdoms wavered; the sound could be heard of a superhuman sword being drawn from its sheath, and there, standing on the horizon, with burning fire in his hand and radiance in his eyes and, in the midst of thunder, spreading his two wings, the Grand Army and the Old Guard: the archangel of war!’","“God forbid that I should diminish France!

Come, let us talk then. I am a new-comer among you, but I confess that you astound me. Where are we? who are we? who are you? who am I? Let us explain ourselves about the emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the u like the royalists. I can tell you that my grandfather does better yet; he says Buonaparté. I thought you were young men. Where is your enthusiasm then? and what do you do with it? whom do you admire, if you do not admire the emperor? and what more must you have? If you do not like that great man, what great men would you have? He was everything. He was complete. He had in his brain the cube of human faculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like Cæsar, his conversation joined the lightning of Pascal to the thunderbolt of Tacitus, he made history and he wrote it, his bulletins are Iliads, he combined the figures of Newton with the metaphors of Mahomet, he left behind him in the Orient words as grand as the pyramids, at Tilsit he taught majesty to emperors, at the Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace, in the Council of State he held his ground with Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of those and to the trickery of these, he was legal with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one candle when two were lighted, he went to the Temple to cheapen a curtain tassel; he saw everything; he knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughing a goodman’s laugh by the cradle of his little child; and all at once, startled Europe listened, armies set themselves in march, parks of artillery rolled along, bridges of boats stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalry galloped in the hurricane, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones everywhere, the frontiers of the kingdoms oscillated upon the map, the sound of a super-human blade was heard leaping from its sheath, men saw him, him, standing erect in the horizon with a flame in his hands and a resplendence in his eyes, unfolding in the thunder his two wings, the Grand Army and the Old Guard, and he was the archangel of war!”"

"― J’ai soif. Mortels, je fais un rêve : que la tonne de Heidelberg ait une attaque d’apoplexie, et être de la douzaine de sangsues qu’on lui appliquera. Je voudrais boire. Je désire oublier la vie. La vie est une invention hideuse de je ne sais qui. Cela ne dure rien et cela ne vaut rien. On se casse le cou à vivre. La vie est un décor où il y a peu de praticables. Le bonheur est un vieux châssis peint d’un seul côté. L’Ecclésiaste dit : tout est vanité ; je pense comme ce bonhomme qui n’a peut-être jamais existé. Zéro, ne voulant pas aller tout nu, s’est vêtu de vanité. O vanité ! rhabillage de tout avec de grands mots ! une cuisine est un laboratoire, un danseur est un professeur, un saltimbanque est un gymnaste, un boxeur est un pugiliste, un apothicaire est un chimiste, un perruquier est un artiste, un gâcheux est un architecte, un jockey est un sportsman, un cloporte est un ptérygibranche. La vanité a un envers et un endroit ; l’endroit est bête, c’est le nègre avec ses verroteries ; l’envers est sot, c’est le philosophe avec ses guenilles. Je pleure sur l’un et je ris de l’autre. Ce qu’on appelle honneurs et dignités, et même honneur et dignité, est généralement en chrysocale. Les rois font joujou avec l’orgueil humain. Caligula faisait consul un cheval ; Charles II faisait chevalier un aloyau. Drapez-vous donc maintenant entre le consul Incitatus et le baronnet Roastbeef. Quant à la valeur intrinsèque des gens, elle n’est guère plus respectable. Écoutez le panégyrique que le voisin fait du voisin. Blanc sur blanc est féroce ; si le lys parlait, comme il arrangerait la colombe ! une bigote qui jase d’une dévote est plus venimeuse que l’aspic et le bongare bleu. C’est dommage que je sois un ignorant, car je vous citerais une foule de choses ; mais je ne sais rien. Par exemple, j’ai toujours eu de l’esprit. Quand j’étais élève chez Gros, au lieu de barbouiller des tableautins, je passais mon temps à chiper des pommes ; rapin est le mâle de rapine. Voilà pour moi ; quant à vous autres, vous me valez. Je me fiche de vos perfections, excellences et qualités. Toute qualité verse dans un défaut ; l’économe touche à l’avare, le généreux confine au prodigue, le brave côtoie le bravache ; qui dit très pieux dit un peu cagot ; il y a juste autant de vices dans la vertu qu’il y a de trous au manteau de Diogène. Qui admirez-vous, le tué ou le tueur, César ou Brutus ? Généralement on est pour le tueur. Vive Brutus ! il a tué. C’est ça qui est la vertu. Vertu, soit, mais folie aussi. Il y a des taches bizarres à ces grands hommes-là. Le Brutus qui tua César était amoureux d’une statue de petit garçon. Cette statue était du statuaire grec Strongylion, lequel avait aussi sculpté cette figure d’amazone appelée Belle-Jambe, Eucnemos, que Néron emportait avec lui dans ses voyages. Ce Strongylion n’a laissé que deux statues qui ont mis d’accord Brutus et Néron ; Brutus fut amoureux de l’une et Néron de l’autre. Toute l’histoire n’est qu’un long rabâchage. Un siècle est le plagiaire de l’autre. La bataille de Marengo copie la bataille de Pydna ; le Tolbiac de Clovis et l’Austerlitz de Napoléon se ressemblent comme deux gouttes de sang. Je fais peu de cas de la victoire. Rien n’est stupide comme vaincre ; la vraie gloire est convaincre. Mais tâchez donc de prouver quelque chose ! Vous vous contentez de réussir, quelle médiocrité ! et de conquérir, quelle misère ! Hélas, vanité et lâcheté partout. Tout obéit au succès, même la grammaire. Si volet usus, dit Horace. Donc, je dédaigne le genre humain. Descendrons-nous du tout à la partie ? Voulez-vous que je me mette à admirer les peuples ? Quel peuple, s’il vous plaît ? Est-ce la Grèce ? Les athéniens, ces parisiens de jadis, tuaient Phocion, comme qui dirait Coligny, et flagornaient les tyrans au point qu’Anacéphore disait de Pisistrate : Son urine attire les abeilles. L’homme le plus considérable de la Grèce pendant cinquante ans a été ce grammairien Philetas, lequel était si petit et si menu qu’il était obligé de plomber ses souliers pour n’être pas emporté par le vent. Il y avait sur la grande place de Corinthe une statue sculptée par Silanion et cataloguée par Pline ; cette statue représentait Épisthate. Qu’a fait Épisthate ? il a inventé le croc-en-jambe. Ceci résume la Grèce et la gloire. Passons à d’autres. Admirerai-je l’Angleterre ? Admirerai-je la France ? La France ? pourquoi ? A cause de Paris ? je viens de vous dire mon opinion sur Athènes. L’Angleterre ? pourquoi ? A cause de Londres ? je hais Carthage. Et puis, Londres, métropole du luxe, est le chef-lieu de la misère. Sur la seule paroisse de Charing-Cross, il y a par an cent morts de faim. Telle est Albion. J’ajoute, pour comble, que j’ai vu une anglaise danser avec une couronne de roses et des lunettes bleues. Donc un groing pour l’Angleterre ! Si je n’admire pas John Bull, j’admirerai donc frère Jonathan ? Je goûte peu ce frère à esclaves. Otez time is money, que reste-t-il de l’Angleterre ? Otez cotton is king, que reste-t-il de l’Amérique ? L’Allemagne, c’est la lymphe ; l’Italie, c’est la bile. Nous extasierons-nous sur la Russie ? Voltaire l’admirait. Il admirait aussi la Chine. Je conviens que la Russie a ses beautés, entre autres un fort despotisme ; mais je plains les despotes. Ils ont une santé délicate. Un Alexis décapité, un Pierre poignardé, un Paul étranglé, un autre Paul aplati à coups de talon de botte, divers Ivans égorgés, plusieurs Nicolas et Basiles empoisonnés, tout cela indique que le palais des empereurs de Russie est dans une condition flagrante d’insalubrité. Tous les peuples civilisés offrent à l’admiration du penseur ce détail, la guerre ; or la guerre, la guerre civilisée, épuise et totalise toutes les formes du banditisme, depuis le brigandage des trabucaires aux gorges du mont Jaxa jusqu’à la maraude des indiens comanches dans la Passe-Douteuse. Bah ! me direz-vous, l’Europe vaut pourtant mieux que l’Asie ? Je conviens que l’Asie est farce ; mais je ne vois pas trop ce que vous avez à rire du grand lama, vous peuples d’occident qui avez mêlé à vos modes et à vos élégances toutes les ordures compliquées de majesté, depuis la chemise sale de la reine Isabelle jusqu’à la chaise percée du dauphin. Messieurs les humains, je vous dis bernique ! C’est à Bruxelles que l’on consomme le plus de bière, à Stockholm le plus d’eau-de-vie, à Madrid le plus de chocolat, à Amsterdam le plus de genièvre, à Londres le plus de vin, à Constantinople le plus de café, à Paris le plus d’absinthe ; voilà toutes les notions utiles. Paris l’emporte, en somme. A Paris, les chiffonniers mêmes sont des sybarites ; Diogène eût autant aimé être chiffonnier place Maubert que philosophe au Pirée. Apprenez encore ceci : les cabarets des chiffonniers s’appellent bibines ; les plus célèbres sont la Casserole et l’Abattoir. Donc, ô guinguettes, goguettes, bouchons, caboulots, bouibouis, mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines des chiffonniers, caravansérails des califes, je vous atteste, je suis un voluptueux, je mange chez Richard à quarante sous par tête, il me faut des tapis de Perse à y rouler Cléopâtre nue ! Où est Cléopâtre ? Ah ! c’est toi, Louison. Bonjour.","- I am thirsty. Mortals, I have a dream: that the ton of Heidelberg has an apoplexy attack, and to be of the dozen leeches that will be applied to him. I would like to drink. I want to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of who knows who. It doesn't last and it's worth nothing. We break our necks to live. Life is a setting where there are few practicable. Happiness is an old chassis painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: all is vanity; I think like this fellow who perhaps never existed. Zero, not wanting to go naked, dressed in vanity. O vanity! dressing up everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a teacher, a mountebank is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a wasteman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a woodlouse is a pterygibranch. Vanity has a back and a place; the place is stupid, it's the negro with his beads; the other side is stupid, it is the philosopher in his rags. I cry over one and laugh over the other. What is called honors and dignities, and even honor and dignity, is generally in chrysocale. Kings play with human pride. Caligula made a horse consul; Charles II knighted a sirloin. So drape yourself now between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is hardly more respectable. Listen to the neighbor's panegyric of the neighbor. White on white is fierce; if the lily spoke, how it would arrange the dove! a bigot who chatters about a devotee is more venomous than the asp and the blue bongar. It is a pity that I am ignorant, because I would quote you a host of things; but I don't know anything. For example, I have always been witty. When I was a student at Gros, instead of daubing pictures, I spent my time picking apples; rapin is the male of rapine. That's it for me; as for you others, you are as good as me. I don't care about your perfections, excellences and qualities. Every quality falls into a defect; the frugal borders on the miser, the generous borders on the prodigal, the brave rub shoulders with the bravado; whoever says very pious says a little cagot; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Who do you admire, the slain or the killer, Caesar or Brutus? Usually we're for the killer. Long live Brutus! he killed. That is virtue. Virtue, yes, but madness too. There are odd stains on these great men. The Brutus who killed Caesar was in love with a statue of a little boy. This statue was by the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who had also sculpted that figure of an amazon called Beautiful-Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him on his travels. This Strongylion left only two statues which put Brutus and Nero in agreement; Brutus was in love with one and Nero with the other. The whole story is just one long rant. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The Battle of Marengo copies the Battle of Pydna; Clovis' Tolbiac and Napoleon's Austerlitz resemble each other like two drops of blood. I don't care about victory. Nothing is stupid like winning; the real glory is convincing. But try to prove something! You are content to succeed, what mediocrity! and to conquer, what misery! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si pane usus, said Horace. Therefore, I despise the human race. Will we come down to the party at all? Do you want me to start admiring people? What people, please? Is it Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of old, killed Phocion, as Coligny would say, and flattered the tyrants to the point that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: His urine attracts bees. The most important man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who was so small and so small that he had to seal his shoes to avoid being carried away by the wind. There was in the great square of Corinth a statue sculpted by Silanion and cataloged by Pliny; this statue represented Episthate. What did Episthatus do? he invented the croc-en-jambe. This sums up Greece and glory. Let's move on to others. Will I admire England? Will I admire France? France ? Why ? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why ? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, metropolis of luxury, is the capital of misery. In the parish of Charing-Cross alone, a hundred people die of starvation a year. Such is Albion. I add, to make matters worse, that I saw an Englishwoman dancing with a crown of roses and blue glasses. So a groing for England! If I don't admire John Bull, then I'll admire Brother Jonathan? I don't like this slave brother. Take away time is money, what's left of England? Take away cotton is king, what's left of America? Germany is the lymph; Italy is bile. Will we rave about Russia? Voltaire admired him. He also admired China. I agree that Russia has its beauties, among others a strong despotism; but I pity the despots. They have delicate health. A beheaded Alexis, a stabbed Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul flattened with the heels of a boot, various Ivans with their throats slit, several Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all these indicate that the palace of the emperors of Russia is in a flagrant condition of unsanitary. All civilized peoples offer to the admiration of the thinker this detail, war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and totalizes all forms of banditry, from the robbery of the trabucaires in the gorges of Mount Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Passe-Douteuse. Bah ! you will say to me, Europe is nevertheless better than Asia? I agree that Asia is stuffing; but I don't really see what you have to laugh at the Grand Lama, you people of the West who have mixed with your fashions and your elegance all the complicated filth of majesty, from Queen Isabella's dirty shirt to the the dolphin's commode. Gentlemen, I tell you fools! It is in Brussels that the most beer is consumed, in Stockholm the most eau-de-vie, in Madrid the most chocolate, in Amsterdam the most juniper, in London the most wine, in Constantinople the more coffee, in Paris the more absinthe; here are all the useful notions. Paris wins, in short. In Paris, even the ragpickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have liked to be a ragpicker on the Place Maubert as much as a philosopher in Piraeus. Learn this again: the cabarets of the ragpickers are called booze; the most famous are the Casserole and the Abattoir. So, o guinguettes, goguettes, corks, caboulots, bouibouis, mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, ragpickers' booze, caravanserai of the caliphs, I attest to you, I am a voluptuous person, I eat at Richard's for forty sous a head, I need Persian carpet to roll Cleopatra naked! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! it's you, Louison. Hello.","Ranting and raving at the top of his voice, he shouted, ‘I’m thirsty! Mortals, I have a dream: that the Heidelberg tun will have a fit of apoplexy, and I’m one of the dozen leeches that will be applied to it. I want to drink. I want to forget life. Life is I don’t know whose hideous invention. It’s over in no time and not worth the candle. You kill yourself living. Life’s a stage set with very little that’s real. Happiness is an old scenery flat painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: “All is vanity.” I agree with that fellow, who probably never existed. Not wanting to go about stark-naked, Zero clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! Dressing everything up in big words! A kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a master, a tumbler is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, a drug dispenser is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a builder’s mate is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a woodlouse is a pterygibranchia. Vanity has a wrong side and a right side: the right side is idiotic, it is the savage with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher in his rags. I weep at the one and laugh at the other. What are called honours and distinctions, and even honour and distinction themselves, are generally fake gold. Kings make a plaything of human pride. Caligula appointed a horse as consul. Charles II knighted a Sir Loin. * So now take pride of place between Consul Incitatus and Baron of Beef. As for people, their intrinsic merit is scarcely any worthier of respect. Listen to the fine things they say about their fellow men. White is vicious about white. If the lily could speak, what it would have to say about the dove! One sanctimonious old biddy gossiping about another is more venomous than the asp or the blue krait. It’s a shame I’m an ignoramus, otherwise I’d be able to give you loads of examples, but I know nothing. However, I’ve always been witty. When I was a pupil of Gros, instead of messing about with paints I spent my time filching apples. Painting is an art of abstraction. So much for myself. As for the rest of you, you’re no better than I am. I couldn’t care less about your perfections, superiorities, qualities. Every virtue degenerates into a vice. Thrift is akin to avarice, generosity is close to extravagance, boldness borders on swagger, whoever says “very dutiful” is saying “a little holier than thou”. There are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes’ cloak. Whom do you admire, the man killed or his killer? Caesar or Brutus? Generally people are in favour of the killer. Long live Brutus! He killed a man! That’s virtue for you. Virtue? Maybe, but madness too. These great men are strangely flawed. The Brutus who killed Caesar was fond of a statue of a little boy. This statue was by the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the “Shapely-legged”, Eucnemos, which Nero took with him on his travels. This Strongylion left only two statues that put Nero and Brutus in agreement with each other. Brutus was fond of one of them, Nero of the other. All history is nothing but endless repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of Marengo is a copy of the battle of Pydna. Clovis’s Tolbiac and Napoleon’s Austerlitz are as like each other as two drops of blood. I don’t set great store by victory. Nothing is so dull-witted as winning the battle. True glory lies in winning the argument. Well, you just try to prove something! You settle for winning? What mediocrity! And for conquering? What pusillanimity! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. * So I scorn the human race. Shall we descend from the general to the particular? You want me to start admiring nations? Which nation, if you please? Is it Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of an earlier age, slew Phocion, another Coligny, and fawned on tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus, “His urine attracts bees.” The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who was so small and puny he was obliged to weight his shoes with lead so as not to be blown away by the wind. There was in the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and recorded by Pliny. This statue represented Epistates. What did Epistates do? He invented a wrestler’s leg hook. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us move on to other candidates. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And besides, London, that metropolis of luxury, is the capital of destitution. In the parish of Charing Cross alone there are a hundred people a year dying of hunger. Such is Albion. And to cap it all, I’ve seen an Englishwoman dance wearing a coronet of roses and blue spectacles. So I thumb my nose at England! And if I don’t admire John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I don’t much care for that slave-owning brother. Take away “Time is money”, and what’s left of England? Take away “Cotton is king”, and what’s left of America? Germany is all lymph, Italy is all bile. Shall we go into raptures about Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also admired China. I grant that Russia has its attractions, among them strong despotism. But I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. An Alexis beheaded, a Peter stabbed, a Paul strangled, another Paul trampled, various Ivans assassinated by having their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned – all this indicates that the palace of the emperors of Russia is in a flagrantly unwholesome state. All civilized nations offer for the admiration of the thinking man this particular feature: war. Now war, civilized war, reduces and subsumes all forms of banditry, from the brigandage of Spanish irregulars in the gorges of Mount Jaxa to marauding Comanches in Doubtful Pass. Bah! You’ll tell me that Europe’s nonetheless better than Asia? I agree that Asia is a joke. But I don’t really see that you peoples of the West can afford to mock the Grand Lama, having included in your manners and refinements all the complicated squalors of majesty, from Queen Isabella’s dirty shift to the Dauphin’s commode. Gentlemen of the human race, I’ve nothing to say to you! Brussels is where the most beer is consumed, Stockholm the most brandy , Madrid the most chocolate, Amsterdam the most gin, London the most wine, Constantinople the most coffee, Paris the most absinthe. That’s all you need to know. In short, Paris wins. In Paris even the rag-pickers are sybarites. Diogenes would just as soon have been a rag-picker on Place Maubert as a philosopher in Piraeus. Something else you should know: the rag-pickers’ taverns are called bibines. The most famous are the Casserole and the Abattoir. So, O garden cafés, glee clubs, taverns, tap-houses, bars, bistros, music halls, dance halls, rag-pickers’ drinking dens, caliphs’ caravanserais, I am, I declare, a voluptuary, I eat at Richard’s at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets in which to roll naked Cleopatra! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! It’s you, Louison. Hallo.’","“I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing. One breaks one’s neck in living. Life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: ‘All is vanity.’ I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are called honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples; rapin24 is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes’ cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Cæsar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who killed Cæsar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing but wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I don’t attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If you are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: “His urine attracts the bees.” The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding brother. Take away Time is money, what remains of England? Take away Cotton is king, what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. ‘Bah!’ you will say to me, ‘but Europe is certainly better than Asia?’ I admit that Asia is a farce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand Lama , you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Piræus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the rag-pickers are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers, caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat at Richard’s at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good day.”","“I am thirsty.

Happiness is an old sash painted on one side. The ecclesiast says: all is vanity; I agree with that goodman who perhaps never existed. Zero, not wishing to go entirely naked, has clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! the patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, a mountebank is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a hodcarrier is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterygoranchiate.

As to the intrinsic value of people, it is hardly respectable any longer. Listen to the panegyric which neighbours pass upon each other.

For instance, I always was bright; when I was a pupil with Gros, instead of daubing pictures, I spent my time in pilfering apples. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you are just as good as I am. I make fun of your perfections, excellences, and good qualities. Every good quality runs into a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous are not far from the prodigal, the brave man is close to the bully; he who says very pious says slightly sanctimonious; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in the mantle of Diogenes. Which do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Cæsar or Brutus? People generally are for the slayer. Hurrah for Brutus! he slew. That is virtue. Virtue, if it may be, but folly also. There are some queer stains on these great men. The Brutus who slew Cæsar was in love with a statue of a little boy. This statue was by the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also designed that statue of an amazon called the Beautiful-limbed, Euknemos, which Nero carried with him on his journeys.

But try now to prove something! you are satisfied with succeeding, what mediocrity! and with conquering, what misery! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. I despise therefore the human race. Shall we descend from the whole to a part? Will you have me set about admiring the peoples? what people, if you please? Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of old times, killed Phocion, as if we should say Coligny, and fawned upon the tyrants to such a degree that Anacephoras said of Pisistratus: His water attracts the bees.

This sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France? what for? on account of Paris. I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? for what? on account of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is the capital of misery. In the single parish of Charing Cross, there are a hundred deaths a year from starvation. Such is Albion. I add, as a completion, that I have seen an English girl dance with a crown of roses and blue spectacles. A groan then for England. If I do not admire John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan then? I have little taste for this brother with his slaves. Take away time is money, and what is left of England? take away cotton is king, and what is left of America? Germany is the lymph; Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired her. He admired China also. I confess that Russia has her beauties, among others a strong despotism; but I am sorry for the despots. They have very delicate health. An Alexis decapitated, a Peter stabbed, a Paul strangled, another Paul trampled down by blows from the heel of a boot, divers Ivans butchered, several Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all that indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in an alarming condition of insalubrity. All civilised nations offer to the admiration of the thinker this circumstance: war; but war, civilised war, exhausts and sums up every form of banditism, from the brigandage of the Trabucaires of the gorges of Mount Jaxa to the marauding of the Camanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. Pshaw! will you tell me Europe is better than Asia for all that? I admit that Asia is ridiculous; but I do not quite see what right you have to laugh at the Grand Lama, you people of the Occident who have incorporated into your fashions and your elegancies all the multifarious ordures of majesty, from Queen Isabella’s dirty chemise to the chamberchair of the dauphin. Messieurs humans, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that they consume the most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; those are all the useful notions. Paris takes the palm on the whole. In Paris, the rag-pickers even are Sybarites; Diogenes would have much rather been a rag-picker in the Place Maubert than a philosopher in the Piræus. Learn this also: the wine-shops of the rag-pickers are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and the Slaughter-house. Therefore, O drinking-shops, eating shops, tavern signs, barrooms, tea parties, meat markets, dance houses, brothels, rag-pickers’ tipling shops, caravanserai of the caliphs, I swear to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat at Richard’s at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets on which to roll Cleopatra naked!

"― Mais je le crois, je le crois, repartit Fauchelevent. Vous n’avez pas besoin de me le dire. Le bon Dieu vous aura pris dans sa main pour vous regarder de près, et puis vous aura lâché. Seulement il voulait vous mettre dans un couvent d’hommes ; il s’est trompé. Allons, encore une sonnerie. Celle-ci est pour avertir le portier d’aller prévenir la municipalité pour qu’elle aille prévenir le médecin des morts pour qu’il vienne voir qu’il y a une morte. Tout ça, c’est la cérémonie de mourir. Elles n’aiment pas beaucoup cette visite-là, ces bonnes dames. Un médecin, ça ne croit à rien. Il lève le voile. Il lève même quelquefois autre chose. Comme elles ont vite fait avertir le médecin, cette fois-ci ! Qu’est-ce qu’il y a donc ? Votre petite dort toujours. Comment se nomme-t-elle ?","“But I believe it, I believe it,” replied Fauchelevent. You don't need to tell me. The good Lord will have taken you in his hand to look at you closely, and then will have let you go. Only he wanted to put you in a convent for men; he was wrong. Come on, another ringtone. This is to warn the doorman to go and warn the municipality so that it can go and warn the doctor of the dead so that he can come and see that there is a dead woman. All this is the ceremony of dying. They don't like that visit very much, those good ladies. A doctor doesn't believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he even raises something else. How quickly they had the doctor informed this time! So what is it? Your little one is still sleeping. What is her name?","‘But so I believe, so I believe,’ replied Fauchelevent. ‘You’ve no need to tell me that. The good Lord must have picked you up in his hand to take a good look at you, and then let you go. Only, he meant to put you in a monastery for men. He made a mistake. Now there’s another bell call. That’s to tell the porter to go and notify the municipality and have them send the doctor for the dead to come and see that someone’s died. All that’s the formalities of dying. They don’t much like that visit, the nuns don’t. A doctor, now he doesn’t believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he even lifts something else. How quickly they’ve called for the doctor this time! What’s going on? I wonder. Your little one’s still asleep. What’s her name?’","“But I believe it, I believe it,” retorted Fauchelevent. “You have no need to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped you. Only, he meant to place you in a man’s convent; he made a mistake. Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?”","“Ah! I believe it , I believe it,” replied Fauchelevent. “You have no need to tell me so. God must have taken you into his hand, to have a close look at you, and then put you down. Only he meant to put you into a monastery; he made a mistake. Hark! another ring; that is to warn the porter to go and notify the municipality, so that they may go and notify the death-physician, so that he may come and see that there is really a dead woman. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies do not like this visit very much. A physician believes in nothing. He lifts the veil. He even lifts something else, sometimes. How soon they have notified the inspector, this time! What can be the matter? Your little one is asleep yet. What is her name?”"

"Il habitait avec le vieux Fauchelevent la baraque du fond du jardin.

They can't read; never mind. Will you abandon them for this? will you curse them with their distress? can't light penetrate these masses? Let's go back to that cry: Light! and let's stick to it! Light ! light ! ""Who knows if these opacities won't become transparent?"" are not revolutions transfigurations? Come on, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think loud, speak loud, run joyfully in the bright sunshine, fraternize with public squares, announce good news, lavish the alphabets, proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasm, uproot from green branches to oak trees. Make the idea a whirlwind. This crowd can be sublimated. Let us know how to make use of this vast conflagration of principles and virtues which sparkles, bursts and quivers at certain times. These bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, this ignorance, this abjection, this darkness, can be employed in the conquest of the ideal. Look through the people and you will see the truth. This vile sand that you trample under your feet, that you throw into the furnace, that it melts there and that it boils there, it will become splendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that Galileo and Newton will discover the stars.","It is, we must emphasize, especially in the faubourgs that the Parisian race is in evidence. There, the thoroughbred. There, its true incarnation. There, this populace toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of the grown man. There, among untold numbers of unidentified individuals is a proliferation of the strangest types, from the docker at La Râpée to the knacker of Montfaucon. ‘Fex urbis!’ exclaims Cicero. * ‘Mob!’ adds Burke indignantly. Rabble, multitude, riff-raff. These words are soon spoken. But even so, what does it matter? What do I care if they go barefoot! They cannot read? Too bad! Would you abandon them for that? Would you doom them to their plight? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! And let us keep calling for it! Light! Light! Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions transfigurations? Go to it, philosophers, teach. Enlighten, illuminate, think aloud, speak aloud, run joyously in the full sunlight, become a friend of the market-place, announce the good news, hand out educational primers, proclaim rights, sing the ‘Marseillaise’ again and again, sow fervour, tear green boughs from the oak trees. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This multitude can be made sublime. Let us be capable of using this vast conflagration of principles and virtues that at certain moments crackles and blazes and quivers. These bare feet, bare arms, rags, this benightedness, degradation, darkness may be used for the conquest of the ideal. Look through the populace and you will see the truth. This vile sand you trample underfoot – let it be thrown into the furnace, let it melt and bubble there. It will turn into clear crystal, and it is thanks to this crystal that Galileo and Newton will discover the stars.","It is in the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears; there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this people toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of man. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom swarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la Râpée to the knacker of Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds Burke, indignantly; rabble, multitude, populace. These are words and quickly uttered. But so be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do go barefoot! They do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you abandon them for that? Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let us obstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions transfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with the public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly, proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd may be rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use of that vast conflagration of principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forth and quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be employed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and you will perceive truth. Let that vile sand which you trample under foot be cast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe there, it will become a splendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that Galileo and Newton will discover stars.","It is in the suburbs especially, we insist, that the Parisian race is found; there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this people works and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two forms of men. There are vast numbers of unknown beings teeming with the strangest types of humanity, from the stevedore of the Rapée to the horsekiller of Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds the indignant Burke; the herd, the multitude, the populace. Those words are quickly said. But if it be so, what matters it? What is it to me that they go barefoot? They cannot read. So much the worse. Will you abandon them for that? Would you make their misfortune their curse? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let us persist in it! Light! light! Who knows but that these opacities will become transparent? are not revolutions transfigurations? Proceed, philosophers, teach, enlighten, enkindle, think aloud, speak aloud, run joyously towards the broad daylight, fraternise in the public squares, announce the glad tidings, scatter plenteously your alphabets, proclaim human rights, sing your Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms broadcast, tear off green branches from the oak-trees. Make thought a whirlwind. This multitude can be sublimated. Let us learn to avail ourselves of this vast combustion of principles and virtues, which sparkles, crackles, and thrills at certain periods. These bare feet, these naked arms, these rags, these shades of ignorance, these depths of abjectness, these abysses of gloom may be employed in the conquest of the ideal. Look through the medium of the people, and you shall discern the truth. This lowly sand which you trample beneath your feet, if you cast it into the furnace, and let it melt and seethe, shall become resplendent crystal, and by means of such as it a Galileo and a Newton shall discover stars."

"De limite à Paris, point. Aucune ville n’a eu cette domination qui bafoue parfois ceux qu’elle subjugue. Vous plaire, ô athéniens ! s’écriait Alexandre. Paris fait plus que la loi, il fait la mode ; Paris fait plus que la mode, il fait la routine. Paris peut être bête si bon lui semble ; il se donne quelquefois ce luxe ; alors l’univers est bête avec lui ; puis Paris se réveille, se frotte les yeux, dit : Suis-je stupide ! et éclate de rire à la face du genre humain. Quelle merveille qu’une telle ville ! Chose étrange que ce grandiose et ce burlesque fassent bon voisinage, que toute cette majesté ne soit pas dérangée par toute cette parodie, et que la même bouche puisse souffler aujourd’hui dans le clairon du jugement dernier et demain dans la flûte à l’oignon ! Paris a une jovialité souveraine. Sa gaîté est de la foudre et sa farce tient un sceptre. Son ouragan sort parfois d’une grimace. Ses explosions, ses journées, ses chefs-d’œuvre, ses prodiges, ses épopées, vont au bout de l’univers, et ses coq-à-l’âne aussi. Son rire est une bouche de volcan qui éclabousse toute la terre. Ses lazzis sont des flammèches. Il impose aux peuples ses caricatures aussi bien que son idéal ; les plus hauts monuments de la civilisation humaine acceptent ses ironies et prêtent leur éternité à ses polissonneries. Il est superbe ; il a un prodigieux 14 juillet qui délivre le globe ; il fait faire le serment du jeu de paume à toutes les nations ; sa nuit du 4 août dissout en trois heures mille ans de féodalité ; il fait de sa logique le muscle de la volonté unanime ; il se multiplie sous toutes les formes du sublime ; il emplit de sa lueur Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Botzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi ; il est partout où l’avenir s’allume, à Boston en 1779, à l’île de Léon en 1820, à Pesth en 1848, à Palerme en 1860 ; il chuchote le puissant mot d’ordre : Liberté, à l’oreille des abolitionistes américains groupés au bac de Harper’s Ferry, et à l’oreille des patriotes d’Ancône assemblés dans l’ombre aux Archi, devant l’auberge Gozzi, au bord de la mer ; il crée Canaris ; il crée Quiroga ; il crée Pisacane ; il rayonne le grand sur la terre ; c’est en allant où son souffle les pousse, que Byron meurt à Missolonghi et que Mazet meurt à Barcelone ; il est tribune sous les pieds de Mirabeau et cratère sous les pieds de Robespierre ; ses livres, son théâtre, son art, sa science, sa littérature, sa philosophie, sont les manuels du genre humain ; il a Pascal, Régnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques, Voltaire pour toutes les minutes, Molière pour tous les siècles ; il fait parler sa langue à la bouche universelle, et cette langue devient verbe ; il construit dans tous les esprits l’idée de progrès ; les dogmes libérateurs qu’il forge sont pour les générations des épées de chevet, et c’est avec l’âme de ses penseurs et de ses poëtes que sont faits depuis 1789 tous les héros de tous les peuples ; cela ne l’empêche pas de gaminer ; et ce génie énorme qu’on appelle Paris, tout en transfigurant le monde par sa lumière, charbonne le nez de Bouginier au mur du temple de Thésée et écrit Crèdeville voleur sur les pyramides.","From limit to Paris, period. No city has had this domination which sometimes flouts those it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris does more than the law, it makes fashion; Paris is more than fashion, it is routine. Paris can be stupid if it sees fit; he sometimes gives himself this luxury; then the universe is stupid with him; then Paris wakes up, rubs her eyes, says: Am I stupid! and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race. How wonderful is such a city! Strange thing that this grandiose and this burlesque make good neighbors, that all this majesty is not disturbed by all this parody, and that the same mouth can blow today in the bugle of the last judgment and tomorrow in the onion flute ! Paris has a sovereign joviality. His gaiety is lightning and his farce holds a scepter. His hurricane sometimes comes out with a grimace. Its explosions, its days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go to the end of the universe, and its cock-a-donkey too. His laughter is a volcano mouth that splashes the whole earth. His lazzi are sparks. He imposes on peoples his caricatures as well as his ideal; the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity to its pranks. He is superb; he has a prodigious July 14 which frees the globe; he makes all nations take the tennis oath; its night of August 4 dissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; he makes his logic the muscle of the unanimous will; it multiplies in all the forms of the sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Botzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; he is everywhere where the future lights up, in Boston in 1779, on the island of Leon in 1820, in Pesth in 1848, in Palermo in 1860; he whispers the powerful slogan: Freedom, in the ear of the American abolitionists grouped at the Harper's Ferry ferry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow of the Archi, in front of the Gozzi inn, in the seaside ; he creates Canaries; he creates Quiroga; he creates Pisacane; he radiates the great on earth; it is while going where his breath pushes them, that Byron dies in Missolonghi and that Mazet dies in Barcelona; it is a tribune under the feet of Mirabeau and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; its books, its theater, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; he has Pascal, Regnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques, Voltaire for all the minutes, Molière for all the centuries; he makes his language speak to the universal mouth, and this language becomes word; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress; the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations of the swords of bedside, and it is with the heart of its thinkers and its poets that are made since 1789 all the heroes of all the people; this does not prevent him from kidding; and that enormous genius called Paris, while transfiguring the world by its light, sticks Bouginier's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes Crédeville voleur on the pyramids.","Paris knows no bounds. No other city has exercised this kind of dominion that sometimes baffles those it subjugates. ‘To please you, O Athenians!’ exclaimed Alexander. Paris does more than set the rules, it sets the fashion. Paris does more than set the fashion, it sets the pattern of daily life. Paris may be stupid if it pleases. It sometimes allows itself this luxury, and the universe is stupid along with it. Then Paris wakes up, rubs its eyes, says ‘What a fool I am!’ and bursts out laughing in the face of humankind. What a marvel is a city such as this! Strange that this grandeur and this buffoonery should sit well with each other, that all this majesty should not be troubled by all this parody, and that the same mouth could today sound the trumpet of doom and tomorrow the tootle-pipe! Paris has a lordly jocularity. Its frivolity has the force of a thunderbolt and its prankishness is invested with sovereignty. Its hurricane sometimes originates in a grimace. Its uprisings, its days of trial, its triumphs, its wonders, its glorious past resound throughout the universe, and its cock-and-bull stories as well. Its laughter is the mouth of a volcano that spills out over the whole world. Its quips are sparks. It imposes on other peoples its caricatures as well as its ideal. The greatest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their immortal fame to its mischievousness. It is magnificent. It has a marvellous fourteenth of July that liberates the world. It makes all nations swear the Tennis Court Oath. Its night of the fourth of August dispels in three hours a thousand years of feudalism. It uses its reasoning as the muscle of unanimous will. It proliferates under all forms of the sublime. It infuses with its light Washington, Kosciuszko, Bolívar, Botsaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, López, John Brown, Garibaldi. Wherever the future is kindled, it is there: at Boston in 1773, at the Isla de León in 1820, at Pest in 1848, at Palermo in 1860. It whispers the mighty watchword ‘Liberty’ in the ears of the American abolitionists gathered at Harpers Ferry, and in the ears of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadows of Gli Archi, by the sea, in front of the Gozzi inn. It creates Canaris , it creates Quiroga, it creates Pisacane. It radiates greatness on earth. It is by going where prompted by its inspiration that Byron dies at Missolonghi and Mazet dies in Barcelona. It is the floor of the debating chamber under Mirabeau’s feet, and the crater under Robespierre’s. Its books, theatre, art, science, literature, philosophy, are the manuals of the human race. It has Pascal, Régnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques, Voltaire for every moment, Molière for every age. It makes its language one that is spoken universally, and this language becomes the Word. It constructs in all minds the idea of progress. The tenets of liberation that it forges are trusty swords for generations, and it is of the spirit of its thinkers and poets that, since 1789, all heroes of all nations are made. This does not stop it behaving like a gamin and, even while transfiguring the world with its light, this vast genius called Paris blackens the wall of the temple of Theseus with a charcoal sketch of Bouginier’s nose and writes on the Pyramids ‘Crédeville’s a thief’.","There is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the fashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris may be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury; then the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, says: “How stupid I am!” and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors, that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the Judgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign joviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre. Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of the universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks. It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious 14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take the oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de Léon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper’s Ferry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was while proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Régnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Molière for all centuries; it makes its language to be talked by the universal mouth, and that language becomes the word; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty friends, and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes of all nations have been made since 1789; this does not prevent vagabondism, and that enormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier ’s nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes Credeville the thief on the Pyramids.","OF BOUNDS and limits, Paris has none. No other city ever enjoyed that supreme control which sometimes derides those whom it reduces to submission. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris does more than lay down the law; it lays down the fashion; Paris does more than lay down the fashion; it lays down the routine. Paris may be stupid if it please; sometimes it allows itself this luxury; then, the whole universe is stupid with it. Upon this Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, and says: “Am I stupid!” and bursts out laughing in the face of mankind. What a marvel is such a city! how strange a thing that all this mass of what is grand and what is ludicrous should be so harmonious, that all this majesty is not disturbed by all this parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow the trump of the last judgment and to-morrow a penny whistle; Paris possesses an all-commanding joviality. Its gaiety is of the thunderbolt, and its frolicking holds a sceptre. Its hurricanes spring sometimes from a wry face. Its outbursts, its great days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics fly to the ends of the universe, and so do its cock and bull stories also. Its laughter is the mouth of a volcano that bespatters the whole earth. Its jokes are sparks that kindle. It forces upon the nations its caricatures as well as its ideal; the loftiest monuments of human civilisation accept its sarcasms and lend their eternity to its waggeries. It is superb; it has a marvellous Fourteenth of July that delivers the globe; it makes all the nations take the oath of the tennis-court; its night of the Fourth of August disperses in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of the unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all the forms of the sublime; it fills with its radiance Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Botzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere, where the future is being enkindled at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de St. Leon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860; it whispers the mighty watchword Liberty in the ears of the American Abolitionists grouped together in the boat at Harper’s Ferry, and also in the ears of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the gloom at the Archi, in front of the Gozzi tavern, on the seaside; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga; it creates Pisicane; it radiates greatness over the earth; it is in going whither its breath impels, that Byron dies at Missolonghi, and Mazet at Barcelona; it is a rostrum beneath the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater beneath the feet of Robespierre; its books, its stage, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy are the manuals of the human race, to it belong Pascal, Regnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean Jacques ; Voltaire for every moment, Molière for every century; it makes the universal mouth speak its language, and that language becomes the Word; it builds up in every mind the idea of progress; the liberating dogmas which it forges are swords by the pillows of the generations and with the soul of its thinkers and poets have all the heroes of all nations since 1789 been made; but that does not prevent it from playing the gamin, and this enormous genius called Paris, even while transfiguring the world with its radiance, draws the nose of Bouginier in charcoal on the wall of the Temple of Theseus, and writes Crédeville the robber on the Pyramids."

"Pourtant, sur certains points et en certains lieux, en dépit de la philosophie, en dépit du progrès, l’esprit claustral persiste en plein dix-neuvième siècle, et une bizarre recrudescence ascétique étonne en ce moment le monde civilisé. L’entêtement des institutions vieillies à se perpétuer ressemble à l’obstination du parfum ranci qui réclamerait notre chevelure, à la prétention du poisson gâté qui voudrait être mangé, à la persécution du vêtement d’enfant qui voudrait habiller l’homme, et à la tendresse des cadavres qui reviendraient embrasser les vivants.","However, at certain points and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the cloistered spirit persists in the middle of the nineteenth century, and a bizarre ascetic recrudescence astonishes the civilized world at this moment. The stubbornness of outdated institutions to perpetuate themselves resembles the stubbornness of rancid perfume which would claim our hair, the pretension of the spoiled fish which would like to be eaten, the persecution of children's clothing which would like to dress the man, and the tenderness of corpses coming back to embrace the living.","Nevertheless, in certain respects and in certain places, despite philosophy, despite progress, the spirit of the cloister lingers on, in the middle of the nineteenth century, and a bizarre new outbreak of asceticism now astounds the civilized world. The persistence of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves is like the stubbornness of stale scent clinging to your hair, the urgency of spoiled fish clamouring to be eaten, the oppression of childish garb expecting to clothe the adult, and the tenderness of corpses wanting to come back to kiss the living.","Nevertheless, at certain points and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and a singular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the persecution of the child’s garment which should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living.","However, on certain points and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, and in spite of progress, the monastic spirit perseveres in the full blaze of the nineteenth century, and a singular revival of asceticism, at this very moment, amazes the civilised world.

"La république, l’empire, n’avaient été pour lui jusqu’alors que des mots monstrueux. La république, une guillotine dans un crépuscule ; l’empire, un sabre dans la nuit. Il venait d’y regarder, et là où il s’attendait à ne trouver qu’un chaos de ténèbres, il avait vu, avec une sorte de surprise inouïe mêlée de crainte et de joie, étinceler des astres, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins, Danton, et se lever un soleil, Napoléon. Il ne savait où il en était. Il reculait aveuglé de clartés. Peu à peu, l’étonnement passé, il s’accoutuma à ces rayonnements, il considéra les actions sans vertige, il examina les personnages sans terreur ; la révolution et l’empire se mirent lumineusement en perspective devant sa prunelle visionnaire ; il vit chacun de ces deux groupes d’événements et d’hommes se résumer dans deux faits énormes ; la république dans la souveraineté du droit civique restituée aux masses, l’empire dans la souveraineté de l’idée française imposée à l’Europe ; il vit sortir de la révolution la grande figure du peuple et de l’empire la grande figure de la France. Il se déclara dans sa conscience que tout cela avait été bon.","The republic, the empire, had hitherto only been monstrous words for him. The republic, a guillotine in a twilight; the empire, a saber in the night. He had just looked there, and where he had expected to find only a chaos of darkness, he had seen, with a kind of unheard-of surprise mingled with fear and joy, sparkling stars, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint -Just, Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins, Danton, and sunrise, Napoleon. He didn't know where he was. He recoiled blinded by lights. Gradually, the astonishment passed, he became accustomed to these rays, he considered the actions without vertigo, he examined the characters without terror; the revolution and the empire were put into luminous perspective before his visionary pupil; he saw each of these two groups of events and men summed up in two enormous facts; the republic in the sovereignty of civil rights restored to the masses, the empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; he saw the great figure of the people emerge from the revolution, and the great figure of France from the empire. He declared in his conscience that it had all been good.","Up until then the Republic, the Empire, had just been monstrous words to him. The Republic, a guillotine in the dusk. The Empire, a sabre in the dark. He had now taken a good look and, where he had expected to find only gloomy chaos, with a kind of extraordinary shock mingled with fear and joy he saw stars shining – Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins, Danton – and a sun rising: Napoleon. He was utterly confused. He shrank back, blinded by the brightness of the light. Little by little, after his initial amazement, he grew accustomed to this radiance, he considered actions without experiencing a sense of vertigo, he examined individuals without experiencing a sense of dread. The Revolution and the Empire came brilliantly into perspective before the eye of his imagination. He saw these two separate complexes of events and of men encapsulated in two tremendous facts: the Republic in the supremacy of civil law restored to the masses, the Empire in the supremacy of the French idea imposed on Europe. He saw emerge from the Revolution the great figure of the people, and from the Empire the great figure of France. He avowed in his conscience that all this had been good.","Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only monstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire, a sword in the night.

He did not know where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little, when his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this radiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves luminously, in perspective, before his mind’s eye; he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire.

There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but with firmness. They meet at Richefeu’s. They are to be found there between twelve and one o’clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow. For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good fellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us.

"Comme il avait cessé d’intercepter le rayon visuel de Marius, Marius maintenant pouvait considérer cette chose, et dans ce badigeonnage il reconnaissait réellement une bataille, un fond de fumée, et un homme qui en portait un autre.

"Bossuet était un garçon gai qui avait du malheur. Sa spécialité était de ne réussir à rien. Par contre, il riait de tout. A vingt-cinq ans, il était chauve. Son père avait fini par avoir une maison et un champ ; mais lui, le fils, n’avait rien eu de plus pressé que de perdre dans une fausse spéculation ce champ et cette maison. Il ne lui était rien resté. Il avait de la science et de l’esprit, mais il avortait. Tout lui manquait, tout le trompait ; ce qu’il échafaudait croulait sur lui. S’il fendait du bois, il se coupait un doigt. S’il avait une maîtresse, il découvrait bientôt qu’il avait aussi un ami. A tout moment quelque misère lui advenait ; de là sa jovialité. Il disait : J’habite sous le toit des tuiles qui tombent. Peu étonné, car pour lui l’accident était le prévu, il prenait la mauvaise chance en sérénité et souriait des taquineries de la destinée comme quelqu’un qui entend la plaisanterie. Il était pauvre, mais son gousset de bonne humeur était inépuisable. Il arrivait vite à son dernier sou, jamais à son dernier éclat de rire. Quand l’adversité entrait chez lui, il saluait cordialement cette ancienne connaissance, il tapait sur le ventre aux catastrophes ; il était familier avec la Fatalité au point de l’appeler par son petit nom. ― Bonjour, Guignon, lui disait-il.","Bossuet was a gay boy who had misfortune.

He had science and wit, but he miscarried. Everything failed him, everything deceived him; what he was building crumbled on top of him. If he split wood, he cut off his finger. If he had a mistress, he soon discovered that he also had a friend. At every moment some misery befell him; hence his joviality. He said: I live under the roof of the falling tiles. Little surprised, because for him the accident was the expected one, he took the bad luck in serenity and smiled at the teasings of destiny like someone who hears the joke.

Championnet, qui brutalisait les miracles, était sorti du pavé de Paris ; il avait, tout petit, inondé les portiques de Saint-Jean de Beauvais et de Saint-Étienne du Mont ; il avait assez tutoyé la châsse de sainte Geneviève pour donner des ordres à la fiole de saint Janvier.","There was that child in Poquelin, fils des halles; there were some in Beaumarchais. Childishness is a nuance of the Gallic spirit. Mixed with common sense, it sometimes adds strength to it, like alcohol to wine. Sometimes it is lacking. Homer repeats, be it; one could say that Voltaire is kidding. Camille Desmoulins was from the suburbs. Championnet, who brutalized miracles, had left the pavement of Paris; he had, as a child, flooded the porticoes of Saint-Jean de Beauvais and Saint-Étienne du Mont; he had familiarized himself enough with the reliquary of Saint Geneviève to give orders to the vial of Saint Janvier.","There was something of this child in Poquelin, son of Les Halles. There was something of him in Beaumarchais. The essence of the gamin is an aspect of the Gallic spirit. It sometimes combines with common sense to fortify it, as alcohol fortifies wine. Sometimes it is a weakness. Yes, Homer nods, but Voltaire might be said to play the gamin. * Camille Desmoulins came from the outer suburbs. Championnet, who strong-armed miracles, sprang from the streets of Paris. He had, as a small lad, ‘flooded the porticoes’† of St-Jean de Beauvais and of St-Étienne du Mont. He was on close enough terms with St Genevieve’s reliquary to be able to command St Januarius’ phial.","There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market; Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter, as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himself eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a small lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of Saint-Étienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Geneviève familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.","THERE WAS something of this urchin in Poquelin, the son of the market-place; there was something of him in Beaumarchais. The gamin style of life is a shade of the Gallic mind. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes gives it additional strength, as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes, it is a defect; Homer nods; one might say Voltaire plays gamin. Camille Desmoulins was a suburban. Championnet, who brutalised miracles, was a child of the Paris streets; he had when a little boy besprinkled the porticoes of St. Jean de Beauvais and St. Etienne du Mont; he had chatted with the shrine of St. Genevieve enough to throw into convulsions the sacred vial of St. Januarius."

"Cependant, quelle que fût sa préoccupation douloureuse, il ne put s’empêcher de se dire que ce rôdeur de barrières à qui Jondrette parlait ressemblait à un certain Panchaud, dit Printanier, dit Bigrenaille, que Courfeyrac lui avait montré une fois et qui passait dans le quartier pour un promeneur nocturne assez dangereux. On a vu, dans le livre précédent, le nom de cet homme. Ce Panchaud, dit Printanier, dit Bigrenaille, a figuré plus tard dans plusieurs procès criminels et est devenu depuis un coquin célèbre. Il n’était encore alors qu’un fameux coquin. Aujourd’hui il est à l’état de tradition parmi les bandits et les escarpes. Il faisait école vers la fin du dernier règne. Et le soir, à la nuit tombante, à l’heure où les groupes se forment et se parlent bas, on en causait à la Force dans la fosse-aux-lions. On pouvait même, dans cette prison, précisément à l’endroit où passait sous le chemin de ronde ce canal des latrines qui servit à la fuite inouïe en plein jour de trente détenus en 1843, on pouvait, au-dessus de la dalle de ces latrines, lire son nom, PANCHAUD, audacieusement gravé par lui sur le mur de ronde dans une de ses tentatives d’évasion. En 1832, la police le surveillait déjà, mais il n’avait pas encore sérieusement débuté.","However, whatever his painful preoccupation, he could not help telling himself that this prowler at roadblocks to whom Jondrette was speaking resembled a certain Panchaud, dit Printanier, dit Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had shown him once and who passed through the neighborhood for a fairly dangerous night walker. We have seen, in the preceding book, the name of this man. This Panchaud, dit Printanier, dit Bigrenaille, later figured in several criminal trials and has since become a famous rascal. He was then only a famous rascal. Today it is a tradition among bandits and scarps. He had a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the time when the groups form and talk to each other in low tones, we talked about it at La Force in the lion's den. One could even, in this prison, precisely at the place where the latrine channel passed under the walkway, which was used for the unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in 1843, one could, above the slab of these latrines, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously engraved by him on the round wall in one of his escape attempts. In 1832, the police were already watching him, but he had not yet seriously started.","Still, sadly preoccupied as he was, he could not help noticing that the prowler at the gates whom Jondrette was talking to looked like a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, that Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him and who was regarded locally as a pretty dangerous night stalker. We have come across this man’s name in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, featured later in several criminal trials and has since become a celebrated scoundrel. At the time he was merely a notorious scoundrel. Today he is something of a legend among villains and cut-throats. He gained a following towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, when groups would form and talk in whispers, he was the topic of conversation in the Lions’ Den at La Force. In that prison, at the exact spot where the latrine sewer, used in 1843 in the unprecedented break-out in broad daylight of thirty prisoners, passes under the guards’ patrol path, you may even read his name, ‘PANCHAUD’, audaciously carved by his own hand into the patrol-path wall above the latrine cover slab during one of his attempted escapes. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but his career had not yet seriously begun.","Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man’s name the reader has learned in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not as yet made a serious beginning.","Nevertheless, however mournful was the subject of his reflections, he could not help saying to himself that this prowler of the barrières with whom Jondrette was talking, resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him, and who passed in the quartier for a very dangerous night-wanderer. We have seen this man’s name in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured afterwards in several criminal trials, and has since become a celebrated scoundrel. He was still at that time only a notorious scoundrel. He is now a matter of tradition among bandits and assassins. He was the head of a school near the close of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when crowds gather and speak low, he was talked about at La Force in La Fosse aux Lions. You might even in that prison, just at the spot where that privy sewer, which served for the astonishing escape of thirty prisoners in broad day in 1843, passes under the encircling passage-way; you might, above the flagging of that sewer, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously cut by himself upon the outer wall in one of his attempts to escape. In 1832, the police already had him under their eye, but he had not yet really made his début."

"Marius, on s’en souvient, avait commencé par là. La passion était survenue et avait achevé de le précipiter dans les chimères sans objet et sans fond. On ne sort plus de chez soi que pour aller songer. Enfantement paresseux. Gouffre tumultueux et stagnant. Et, à mesure que le travail diminuait, les besoins croissaient. Ceci est une loi. L’homme, à l’état rêveur, est naturellement prodigue et mou ; l’esprit détendu ne peut pas tenir la vie serrée. Il y a, dans cette façon de vivre, du bien mêlé au mal, car si l’amollissement est funeste, la générosité est saine et bonne. Mais l’homme pauvre, généreux et noble, qui ne travaille pas, est perdu. Les ressources tarissent, les nécessités surgissent.","Marius, we remember, had started there. Passion had arisen and had completed its precipitating into objectless and bottomless chimeras. We no longer leave our homes except to go and think. Lazy childbirth. Turbulent and stagnant chasm. And, as the work diminished, the needs grew. This is a law. Man, in the dreaming state, is naturally prodigal and soft; the relaxed mind cannot hold life tight. There is, in this way of life, good mingled with evil, for if softening is fatal, generosity is healthy and good. But the poor, generous, noble man who does not work is lost. Resources dry up, necessities arise.","Marius, remember, had started out like this. Passion had intervened and given him the final push into flights of fancy without purpose or substance. A person in such a state leaves the house only to go daydreaming. Idle pastime. Stagnant and turbulent abyss. And with less and less work came more and more needs. This is a law. Man, when he is a dreamer, is naturally lavish and lax. The relaxed mind cannot keep a tight grip on life. There is good and bad in this style of life, for while laxity is pernicious, generosity is kind-hearted and wholesome. But the generous and noble pauper who does not work is doomed. Resources run out, necessities arise.","Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæras without object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one’s self except for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase. This is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and slack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds. There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.","Marius, we remember, had begun in this way. Passion supervened, and had at last precipitated him into bottomless and aimless chimeras. One no longer goes out of the house except to walk and dream. Sluggish birth. A tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, as work diminishes, necessities increase. This is the law. Man, in the dreamy state, is naturally prodigal and luxurious; the relaxed mind cannot lead a severe life. There is, in this way of living, some good mingled with the evil, for if the softening be fatal, the generosity is wholesome and good. But the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. His resources dry up, his necessities mount up."
"Marius vivait solitaire. Par ce goût qu’il avait de rester en dehors de tout, et aussi pour avoir été par trop effarouché, il n’était décidément pas entré dans le groupe présidé par Enjolras.

"Pour se distraire de cette curiosité qui l’agitait un peu au delà de ses habitudes, elle s’était réfugiée dans ses talents, et elle s’était mise à festonner avec du coton sur du coton une de ces broderies de l’empire et de la restauration où il y a beaucoup de roues de cabriolet. Ouvrage maussade, ouvrière revêche. Elle était depuis plusieurs heures sur sa chaise quand la porte s’ouvrit. Mlle Gillenormand leva le nez ; le lieutenant Théodule était devant elle, et lui faisait le salut d’ordonnance. Elle poussa un cri de bonheur.

Tedious work, peevish worker. She had been sitting there for several hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand looked up. Lieutenant Théodule stood before her, giving her the regulation salute. She squealed with delight. A person may be old, she may be a prude, she may be pious, she may be an aunt, but it is always a pleasure for her to see a lancer come into her room.","In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping, with one layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the Empire and the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels.

"Toute cette aventure grandit le bon vieux Fauchelevent ; il eut un triple succès ; auprès de Jean Valjean qu’il sauva et abrita ; auprès du fossoyeur Gribier qui se disait : il m’a épargné l’amende ; auprès du couvent qui, grâce à lui, en gardant le cercueil de la mère Crucifixion sous l’autel, éluda César et satisfit Dieu. Il y eut une bière avec cadavre au Petit-Picpus et une bière sans cadavre au cimetière Vaugirard ; l’ordre public en fut sans doute profondément troublé, mais on ne s’en aperçut pas. Quant au couvent, sa reconnaissance pour Fauchelevent fut grande. Fauchelevent devint le meilleur des serviteurs et le plus précieux des jardiniers. A la plus prochaine visite de l’archevêque, la prieure conta la chose à sa grandeur, en s’en confessant un peu et en s’en vantant aussi. L’archevêque, au sortir du couvent, en parla, avec applaudissement et tout bas, à M. de Latil, confesseur de Monsieur, plus tard archevêque de Reims et cardinal. L’admiration pour Fauchelevent fit du chemin, car elle alla à Rome. Nous avons eu sous les yeux un billet adressé par le pape régnant alors, Léon XII, à un de ses parents, monsignor dans la nonciature de Paris, et nommé comme lui Della Genga ; on y lit ces lignes : « Il paraît qu’il y a dans un couvent de Paris un jardinier excellent, qui est un saint homme, appelé Fauvent. » Rien de tout ce triomphe ne parvint jusqu’à Fauchelevent dans sa baraque ; il continua de greffer, de sarcler, et de couvrir ses melonnières, sans être au fait de son excellence et de sa sainteté. Il ne se douta pas plus de sa gloire que ne s’en doute un bœuf de Durham ou de Surrey dont le portrait est publié dans l’Illustrated London News avec cette inscription : Bœuf qui a remporté le prix au concours des bêtes à cornes.","All this adventure made good old Fauchelevent grow; he had a triple success; with Jean Valjean whom he saved and sheltered; with the gravedigger Gribier who said to himself: he spared me the fine; to the convent which, thanks to him, by keeping the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Caesar and satisfied God. There was a coffin with a corpse at the Petit-Picpus and a coffin without a corpse in the Vaugirard cemetery; public order was no doubt deeply disturbed, but it was not noticed. As for the convent, its gratitude for Fauchelevent was great. Fauchelevent became the best of servants and the most precious of gardeners. At the Archbishop's next visit, the prioress told the story to her greatness, confessing a little and boasting about it too. The Archbishop, on leaving the convent, spoke of it, with applause and in a low voice, to M. de Latil, Monsieur's confessor, later Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. Admiration for Fauchelevent made progress, for she went to Rome. We have had before us a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII, to one of his relatives, monsignor in the nunciature of Paris, and named like him Della Genga; we read these lines: “It seems that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is a holy man, called Fauvent. None of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he continued to graft, to weed, and to cover his melons, without being aware of his excellence and his holiness. He no more doubted his glory than does an ox from Durham or Surrey whose portrait is published in the Illustrated London News with this inscription: Ox that has won the prize in the competition for horned beasts.","This entire escapade increased good old Fauchelevent’s standing. He scored a triple success: with Jean Valjean, whom he rescued and took in; with the gravedigger Gribier, who said to himself ‘He saved me that fine’; with the convent, which, thanks to him, by keeping Mère Crucifixion’s coffin under the altar, evaded Caesar and satisfied God. There was a coffin with a body in it at Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body at Vaugirard Cemetery. Public order was no doubt seriously breached, but did not know it. As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was great. Fauchelevent became the best of servants and the most precious of gardeners. On the archbishop’s next visit the prioress recounted the affair to His Grace, partly confessing to it and also boasting of it. After leaving the convent the archbishop spoke of it with approval and very discreetly to Monsieur de Latil, confessor to Monsieur, later archbishop of Reims and cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent spread far and wide, for it reached Rome. We have seen with our own eyes a note addressed by the then reigning pope, Leo XII, to one of his relatives, a monsignor in the nuncio’s office in Paris and named, like himself, Della Genga. These lines are to be read in it: ‘Apparently there is in the Paris convent an excellent gardener who is a saintly man called Fauvent.’ None of all this glory reached Fauchelevent in his hut. He went on grafting, hoeing, and covering up his melon beds, without being informed of his excellence and his saintliness. He had no more inkling of his renown than a Durham or Surrey bull whose picture is published in the Illustrated London News with this caption: ‘Prize-winning bull at cattle show’.","The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said to himself: “He spared me that fine”; with the convent, which, being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it. As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great. Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop’s next visit, the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio’s establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; it contained these lines: “ It appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.” Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the London Illustrated News, with this inscription: “Bull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show.”","This whole affair elevated good old Fauchelevent greatly; he had achieved a triple success;—in the eyes of Jean Valjean whom he had rescued and sheltered; with the gravedigger, Gribier, who said he had saved him from a fine; and, at the convent, which, thanks to him, in retaining the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was a coffin with a body in it at the Petit Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery. Public order was greatly disturbed thereby, undoubtedly, but nobody perceived it. As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was deep. Fauchelevent became the best of servants and the most precious of gardeners. At the next visit of the archbishop the prioress related the affair to his grace, half by way of a confession and half as a boast. The archbishop, on returning from the convent, spoke of it with commendation and very quietly to M. de Latil, the Confessor of Monsieur, and, subsequently, Archbishop of Rheims and a cardinal. This praise and admiration for Fauchelevent travelled far, for it went to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, Monsignore of the Papal Embassy at Paris, who bore the same name as his own, Della Genga. It contained these lines: “ It seems that there is in a convent in Paris, an excellent gardener who is a holy man, named Fauvent.” Not a whisper of all this fame reached Fauchelevent in his shanty; he continued to weed and graft and cover his melon-beds without being; in the least, aware of his excellence and holiness. He had no more suspicion of his splendid reputation than any Durham or Surrey ox whose picture is published in the London Illustrated News with this inscription: “The ox which won the premium at the cattle show.”"

Le cardinal de Clermont-Tonnerre était un petit vieillard gai montrant ses bas rouges sous sa soutane troussée ; il avait pour spécialité de haïr l’Encyclopédie et de jouer éperdument au billard, et les gens qui, à cette époque, passaient dans les soirs d’été rue Madame, où était alors l’hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre, s’arrêtaient pour entendre le choc des billes, et la voix aiguë du cardinal criant à son conclaviste, monseigneur Cottret, évêque in partibus de Caryste : Marque, l’abbé, je carambole. Le cardinal de Clermont-Tonnerre avait été amené chez madame de T. par son ami le plus intime, M. de Roquelaure, ancien évêque de Senlis et l’un des quarante. M. de Roquelaure était considérable par sa haute taille et par son assiduité à l’académie ; à travers la porte vitrée de la salle voisine de la bibliothèque où l’académie française tenait alors ses séances, les curieux pouvaient tous les jeudis contempler l’ancien évêque de Senlis, habituellement debout, poudré à frais, en bas violets, et tournant le dos à la porte, apparemment pour mieux faire voir son petit collet. Tous ces ecclésiastiques, quoique la plupart hommes de cour autant qu’hommes d’église, s’ajoutaient à la gravité du salon de T., dont cinq pairs de France, le marquis de Vibraye, le marquis de Talaru, le marquis d’Herbouville, le vicomte Dambray et le duc de Valentinois, accentuaient l’aspect seigneurial. Ce duc de Valentinois, quoique prince de Monaco, c’est-à-dire prince souverain étranger, avait une si haute idée de la France et de la pairie qu’il voyait tout à travers elles. C’était lui qui disait : Les cardinaux sont les pairs de France de Rome ; les lords sont les pairs de France d’Angleterre. Au reste, car il faut en ce siècle que la révolution soit partout, ce salon féodal était, comme nous l’avons dit, dominé par un bourgeois. M. Gillenormand y régnait.","As for the priests, it was Father Halma, the same to whom Mr. Larose, his collaborator at La Foudre, said: Bah! who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns maybe! Abbé Letourneur, preacher to the king, Abbé Frayssinous, who was not yet a count, bishop, minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock with missing buttons, and Abbé Keravenant, parish priest of Saint-Germain des Pres; plus the papal nuncio, then monsignor Macchi, archbishop of Nisibi, later a cardinal, remarkable for his long pensive nose, and another monsignor thus titled: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven participating prothonotaries of the Holy See, canon of the Liberian basilica insignia, advocate of saints, postulatore di santi, which relates to matters of canonization and roughly means master of petitions of the paradise section; lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne and M. de Clermont-Tonnerre. M. le Cardinal de la Luzerne was a writer and was to have, a few years later, the honor of signing articles in the Conservateur side by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Clermont-Tonnerre was Archbishop of Toulouse and often came to vacation in Paris with his nephew the Marquis de Tonnerre, who was minister of the navy and of war. The Cardinal de Clermont-Tonnerre was a gay little old man showing off his red stockings under his tucked cassock; his specialty was hating the Encyclopedia and playing billiards madly, and the people who, at that time, passed on summer evenings in the rue Madame, where the Hôtel de Clermont-Tonnerre then stood, stopped to hear the clash of marbles, and the shrill voice of the cardinal crying out to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cottret, bishop in partibus of Caryste: Marque, l'abbé, je carambole. The Cardinal de Clermont-Tonnerre had been taken to Madame de T. by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former bishop of Senlis and one of the forty. M. de Roquelaure was considerable for his height and his attendance at the academy; through the glass door of the room next to the library where the French Academy then held its sessions, the curious could every Thursday contemplate the former Bishop of Senlis, usually standing, freshly powdered, in purple stockings, and turning the back to the door, apparently to show off her little collar better. All these ecclesiastics, although mostly men of the court as well as men of the church, added to the gravity of T.'s salon, including five peers of France, the Marquis de Vibraye, the Marquis de Talaru, the Marquis d' Herbouville, the viscount Dambray and the duke of Valentinois, accentuated the seigniorial aspect. This Duke of Valentinois, although Prince of Monaco, that is to say a foreign sovereign prince, had such a lofty idea of France and the peerage that he saw everything through them. It was he who said: The cardinals are the peers of France in Rome; the lords are the peers of France of England. Besides, for revolution must be everywhere in this century, this feudal drawing-room was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.","As for the priests, there were Abbé Halma, the one to whom Monsieur Larose, his collaborator at La Foudre, used to say, ‘Bah! Who isn’t fifty? Maybe the odd whippersnapper!’ ; Abbé Letourneur, preacher to the king; Abbé Frayssinous, who was not yet count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock with buttons missing; and Abbé Keravenant, parish priest of St-Germain-des-Prés; also the pope’s nuncio, at that time Monsignor Macchi, archbishop of Nisibis, later cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensive nose; and another monsignor with the following title: Abate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven apostolic protonotaries of the Holy See, canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, the saints’ advocate, postulatore dei santi, which relates to the process of canonization and more or less means master of requests for the department of paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, Monsieur de la Luzerne and Monsieur de Clermont-Tonnerre. Monsieur le cardinal de la Luzerne was a writer and was destined a few years later to have the honour of putting his name to articles in Le Conservateur alongside Chateaubriand. Monsieur de Clermont-Tonnerre was archbishop of Toulouse and often made trips to Paris to stay with his nephew, the Marquis de Tonnerre, who was minister for the navy and minister of war. The cardinal of Clermont-Tonnerre was a cheerful little old man who showed off his red stockings under his hitched-up cassock. His particular obsessions were a hatred of the Encyclopaedia and a passion for playing billiards, and on summer evenings in those days, people walking down Rue Madame where the Clermont-Tonnerre residence then stood would stop to listen to the clacking of billiard balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal crying out to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cottret, bishop in partibus of Caryste, ‘Mark that up, abbé, it was a cannon shot.’ The cardinal of Clermont-Tonnerre had been brought along to Madame de T’s by his closest friend Monsieur de Roquelaure, former bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. Monsieur de Roquelaure was impressive on account of his great height and his assiduous attendance at the Academy. Every Thursday, through the glass door of the room adjacent to the library where the French Academy then held its meetings, curious onlookers could watch the former bishop of Senlis, usually on his feet, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back to the door apparently so as to give a better view of his embroidered collar. All these ecclesiastics, although most were as much courtiers as they were churchmen, added to the gravity of the de T salon, whose aristocratic credentials were enhanced by five peers of France: the Marquis de Vibraye, the Marquis de Talaru, the Marquis d’Herbouville, Vicomte Dambray and the Duc de Valentinois. This Duc de Valentinois, although Prince of Monaco, in other words a foreign sovereign prince, had so high an opinion of France and its peerage that he saw everything in relation to them. It was he who said, ‘The cardinals are Rome’s peers of France; the lords, England’s peers of France.’ However, as there must be revolution everywhere this century, this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. Monsieur Gillenormand reigned there.","As for the priests, there was the Abbé Halma, the same to whom M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: “Bah! Who is there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?” The Abbé Letourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbé Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abbé Keravenant, Curé of Saint-Germain-des-Prés; also the Pope’s Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, Postulatore dei Santi, which refers to matters of canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the section of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl ****** T *******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have, a few years later, the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand ; M. de Cl****** T ******* was Archbishop of Toul ****, and often made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The Cardinal of Cl ****** T ******* was a merry little man, who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopædia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl ****** T ******* then stood, halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: “Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon.” The Cardinal de Cl ****** T ******* had been brought to Madame de T.’s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib**** , the Marquis de Tal *** , the Marquis de Herb *******, the Vicomte Damb ***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince de Mon ***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea of France and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium. It was he who said: “The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of France of England.” Moreover, as it is indispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.","As for the priests, there was Abbé Halma, the same to whom M. Larose, his assistant on La Foudre, said: Pshaw! who is there that is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps? Abbé Letourneur, the king’s preacher, Abbé Frayssinous, was not yet either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock short of buttons, and Abbé Keravenant, curé de Saint Germain des Prés; besides these the Pope’s Nuncio, at that time Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, afterwards cardinal, remarkable for his long pensive nose, and another monsignor with the following titles: Abbate Palmieri, Domestic Prelate, one of the seven participating prothonotaries of the Holy See, canon of the Insignia of the Liberian Basilicate, advocate of the Saints, postulatore di santi, which relates to the business of canonisation and signifies very nearly: master of requests for the section of paradise. Finally, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne and Monsieur de Cl—— T——. The Cardinal de la Luzerne was a writer, and was to have, some years later, the honour of signing articles in the Conservateur side by side with Chateaubriand; Monsieur de Cl—— T—— was Archbishop of Toul——, and often came to rusticate at Paris with his nephew the Marquis of T——, who has been Minister of Marine and of War. The Cardinal de Cl—— T—— was a little, lively old man, showing his red stockings under his turned-up cassock; his peculiarities were hate of the Encyclopedia and desperate play at billiards, and people who, at that time, on summer evenings passed along the Rue M——, where the Hôtel de Cl—— T—— was at that time, stopped to hear the clicking of the balls and the sharp voice of the cardinal crying to his fellow conclavist, Monseigneur Cottret, Bishop in partibus of Carysta: Mark, Abbé, I have caromed. The Cardinal de Cl—— T—— had been brought to Madame de T.’s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, formerly Bishop of Senlis and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was noteworthy for his tall stature and his assiduity at the Academy; through the glass door of the hall near the Library in which the French Academy then held its sessions, the curious could every Friday gaze upon the old Bishop of Senlis, usually standing, freshly powdered, with violet stockings, and turning his back to the door, apparently to show his little collar to better advantage. All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part courtiers as well as churchmen, added to the importance of the T. salon, the lordly aspect of which was emphasised by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib——, the Marquis de Tal——, the Marquis d’Herb——, the Viscount Damo——, and the Duke de Val——. This Duke de Val——, although Prince de Mon——, that is to say, a foreign sovereign prince, had so high an idea of France and the peerage that he saw everything through their medium. He it was who said: The cardinals are the French peers of Rome; the Lords are the French peers of England. Finally, since, in this century, the revolution must make itself felt everywhere, this feudal salon was, as we have said, ruled by a bourgeois. Monsieur Gillenormand reigned there."

"Ce que nous disons là n’ôte rien au serrement de cœur dont on se sent pris chaque fois qu’on rencontre un de ces enfants autour desquels il semble qu’on voit flotter les fils de la famille brisée.

"Une fois, ayant confiance dans un beau soleil de septembre, Marius s’était laissé mener au bal de Sceaux par Courfeyrac, Bossuet et Grantaire, espérant, quel rêve ! qu’il la retrouverait peut-être là.

Marius left his friends at the ball, and returned on foot, alone, weary, feverish, his eyes troubled and sad in the night, bewildered by the noise and dust of the joyful cuckoo clocks full of singing beings returning from the party. and passed by him, discouraged, inhaling to cool their heads the acrid scent of the walnut trees on the road.","Once, trusting in some lovely September sunshine, Marius allowed himself to be taken along by Courfeyrac, Bossuet and Grantaire to the public dance at Sceaux, hoping – what a pipe dream! – that he might perhaps find her there.

Marius left his friends at the dance and walked home alone, weary, feverish, his eyes blurred and sad in the dark; stunned by the noise and dust of the cheerful charabancs overtaking him, full of people singing on their way back from the festivities; feeling downhearted and, to clear his head, breathing in the pungent smell of the walnut-trees along the road.","Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there.

Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot, alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes, stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to him, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.","Once, confiding in a beautiful September sun, Marius allowed himself to be taken to the Bal de Sceaux, by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might possibly find her there.

Marius left his friends at the ball, and went back on foot, alone, tired, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes, in the night, overcome by the noise and dust of the joyous coaches full of singing parties who passed by him returning from the festival, while he, discouraged, was breathing in the pungent odour of the walnut trees by the wayside, to restore his brain."

"Ces salons ne furent pas longtemps purs. Dès 1818, quelques doctrinaires commencèrent à y poindre, nuance inquiétante. La manière de ceux-là était d’être royalistes et de s’en excuser. Là où les ultras étaient très fiers, les doctrinaires étaient un peu honteux. Ils avaient de l’esprit ; ils avaient du silence ; leur dogme politique était convenablement empesé de morgue ; ils devaient réussir. Ils faisaient, utilement d’ailleurs, des excès de cravate blanche et d’habit boutonné. Le tort, ou le malheur, du parti doctrinaire a été de créer la jeunesse vieille. Ils prenaient des poses de sages. Ils rêvaient de greffer sur le principe absolu et excessif un pouvoir tempéré. Ils opposaient, et parfois avec une rare intelligence, au libéralisme démolisseur un libéralisme conservateur. On les entendait dire : « Grâce pour le royalisme ! il a rendu plus d’un service. Il a rapporté la tradition, le culte, la religion, le respect. Il est fidèle, brave, chevaleresque, aimant, dévoué. Il vient mêler, quoique à regret, aux grandeurs nouvelles de la nation les grandeurs séculaires de la monarchie. Il a le tort de ne pas comprendre la révolution, l’empire, la gloire, la liberté, les jeunes idées, les jeunes générations, le siècle. Mais ce tort qu’il a envers nous, ne l’avons-nous pas quelquefois envers lui ? La révolution, dont nous sommes les héritiers, doit avoir l’intelligence de tout. Attaquer le royalisme, c’est le contre-sens du libéralisme. Quelle faute ! et quel aveuglement ! La France révolutionnaire manque de respect à la France historique, c’est-à-dire à sa mère, c’est-à-dire à elle-même. Après le 5 septembre, on traite la noblesse de la monarchie comme après le 8 juillet on traitait la noblesse de l’empire. Ils ont été injustes pour l’aigle, nous sommes injustes pour la fleur de lys. On veut donc toujours avoir quelque chose à proscrire ! Dédorer la couronne de Louis XIV, gratter l’écusson d’Henri IV, cela est-il bien utile ? Nous raillons M. de Vaublanc qui effaçait les N du pont d’Iéna. Que faisait-il donc ? Ce que nous faisons. Bouvines nous appartient comme Marengo. Les fleurs de lys sont à nous comme les N. C’est notre patrimoine. A quoi bon l’amoindrir ? Il ne faut pas plus renier la patrie dans le passé que dans le présent. Pourquoi ne pas vouloir toute l’histoire ? Pourquoi ne pas aimer toute la France ? »","These salons were not long pure. As early as 1818, a few doctrinaires began to appear there, a worrying nuance. The way of these was to be royalists and to apologize for it. Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinaires were a bit ashamed. They had spirit; they were silent; their political dogma was suitably weighted with arrogance; they had to succeed. They made, usefully moreover, excesses of white tie and buttoned coat. The wrong, or the misfortune, of the doctrinaire party has been to create old youth. They took wise poses. They dreamed of grafting on the absolute and excessive principle a moderate power. They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, to demolishing liberalism a conservative liberalism. They were heard to say: “Thanks for royalism! he has rendered more than one service. He brought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. He is faithful, brave, chivalrous, loving, devoted. It comes to mingle, albeit reluctantly, with the new grandeurs of the nation the age-old grandeurs of the monarchy. He is wrong not to understand the revolution, the empire, the glory, the freedom, the young ideas, the young generations, the century. But this wrong which he has towards us, do we not sometimes have it towards him? The revolution, of which we are the heirs, must understand everything. Attacking royalism is the opposite of liberalism. What a fault! and what blindness! Revolutionary France lacks respect for historical France, that is, for its mother, that is, for itself. After September 5, the nobility of the monarchy is treated as after July 8, the nobility of the empire is treated. They were unjust to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lis. So we always want to have something to proscribe! Degilding the crown of Louis XIV, scratching the coat of arms of Henri IV, is that very useful? We laugh at M. de Vaublanc who erased the N from the Pont d'Iéna. What was he doing? What we do. Bouvines belongs to us like Marengo. The fleur-de-lis are ours like the N. It is our heritage. Why reduce it? One must no more deny the fatherland in the past than in the present. Why not want the whole story? Why not love all of France? »","These salons did not long preserve their purity. As early as 1818 a few ‘constitutional’ monarchists (a disquieting distinction) began to spring up among them. The line they followed was to be royalist and to be apologetic about it. Whereas the ultras were very proud, these ‘doctrinaires’* were a little shameful. They were capable of wit; they were capable of silence; their political dogma was suitably starched with arrogance; they were bound to succeed. They favoured inordinately, to their advantage in fact, white cravats and buttoned-up coats. The mistake, or the misfortune, of the ‘doctrinaire’ party was to create old young men. They adopted the attitude of sages. They dreamed of grafting restricted power on to the absolute principle of unrestraint. Against radical liberalism they urged, and sometimes with a rare intelligence, conservative liberalism. They were heard to say, ‘Spare monarchism! It has done more than a little good. It has restored tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is loyal, brave, chivalrous, loving, dedicated. To the new greatness of the nation it has brought, albeit reluctantly, the age-old greatness of the monarchy. It is wrong in not understanding the Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this wrong it does us – have we not sometimes been guilty of the same wrong towards monarchism? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, must have understanding of everything. To attack monarchism is a contradiction of liberalism. What a mistake! And what blindness! Revolutionary France lacks respect for historic France, in other words its mother, in other words itself. After the fifth of September, the monarchy’s nobility was treated as the Empire’s nobility was treated after the eighth of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. Must we always have something to outlaw! Does it serve any purpose to ungild Louis XIV’s crown, to scrape away Henri IV’s coat of arms? We jeer at Monsieur de Vaublanc who removed the Ns on the Pont d’Iéna! Well, what was he doing? What are we doing? Bouvines is as much ours as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the Ns. That is our patrimony. What is the good of diminishing it? We should not turn our back on our country in the past any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history? Why not love the whole of France?’","These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818, doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way was to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had wit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully too, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle. They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: “Thanks for Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has brought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled, though with regret, the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this mistake which it makes with regard to us,—have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to be intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France is wanting in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards its mother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire was treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de Vaublanc for erasing the N’s from the bridge of Jena! What was it that he did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N’s. That is our patrimony. To what purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present.

As early as 1818, doctrinaires began to bud out in them, a troublesome species. Their style was to be royalists, and to apologise for it. Just where the ultras were proudest, the doctrinaires were a little ashamed. They were witty; they were silent; their political dogmas were suitably starched with pride; they ought to have been successful. They indulged in what was moreover convenient, an excess of white cravat and close-buttoned coat. The fault, or the misfortune of the doctrinaire-party was the creation of an old youth. They assumed the postures of sages. Their dream was to engraft upon an absolute and excessive principle a limited power. They opposed, and sometimes with a rare intelligence, destructive liberalism by conservative liberalism. We heard them say: “Be considerate towards royalism; it has done much real service. It has brought us back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It comes to associate, although with regret, to the new grandeur of the nation the old grandeur of the monarchy. It is wrong in not comprehending the revolution, the empire, glory, liberty, new ideas, new generations, the century. But this wrong which it does us, have we not sometimes done it the same?

Of what use is it to deface the crown of Louis XIV., or to scratch off the escutcheon of Henry IV.? We rail at Monsieur de Vaublanc who effaced the N’s. from the Bridge of Jena? But what did he do? What we are doing. Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lis are ours as well as the N’s. They are our patrimony. What is gained by diminishing it?

On ne vous aurait même pas bâillonné. Et je vais vous dire pourquoi. C’est que cette chambre-ci est très sourde. Elle n’a que cela pour elle, mais elle a cela. C’est une cave. On y tirerait une bombe que cela ferait pour le corps de garde le plus prochain le bruit d’un ronflement d’ivrogne. Ici le canon ferait boum et le tonnerre ferait pouf. C’est un logement commode. Mais enfin vous n’avez pas crié, c’est mieux, je vous en fais mon compliment, et je vais vous dire ce que j’en conclus. Mon cher monsieur, quand on crie, qu’est-ce qui vient ? la police.

Donc nous pouvons nous entendre.","- My God ! if you had cried thief a little, I would not have found it improper. To the killer! it is said on occasion, and, as for me, I would not have taken it in bad part. It's quite simple that we make a little noise when we find ourselves with people who do not inspire enough confidence in us. If you had done that, you wouldn't have been bothered. You wouldn't even have been gagged. And I'll tell you why. This room is very deaf. She only has that for her, but she has that. It's a cellar. If a bomb were fired there, it would make the noise of a drunkard's snoring for the nearest guardhouse. Here the cannon would boom and the thunder would poof. It is a convenient accommodation. But anyway you didn't shout, it's better, I pay you my compliments, and I'll tell you what I conclude. My dear sir, when you shout, what comes? the police. And after the police? Justice. Well, you didn't shout, it's because you don't care any more than we do to see justice and the police arrive. It's because - I've suspected it for a long time - you have some interest in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. So we can get along.","Thénardier went on, ‘My God! You might have cried thief and I wouldn’t have thought it improper! Or murder! People do on occasion – and I wouldn’t have taken it amiss. It’s perfectly normal to create a bit of a rumpus when you find yourself with individuals that don’t inspire enough trust. If you had, no one would have stopped you. You wouldn’t even have been gagged. And I’ll tell you why. This room’s very out of the way. That’s the only thing in its favour but it has got that. It’s like a cellar. You might let a bomb off inside it, and at the nearest guard-house it’d sound like the snoring of a drunk. Here a cannon would make a pop and thunder a whisper. It’s a handy place to live. But anyhow, you didn’t cry out, and so much the better, I congratulate you on that, and I’ll tell you what conclusion I draw. My dear monsieur, when you cry out, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You didn’t cry out. That’s because you’re no keener than we are to have the police and justice turn up. That’s because – I’ve long suspected it – you’ve an interest in hiding something. We ourselves have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding.’","“Mon Dieu! You might have shouted ‘stop thief’ a bit, and I should not have thought it improper. ‘Murder!’ That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who don’t inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. That’s its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make a pouf. It’s a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry; that is because you don’t care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,—I have long suspected it,—you have some interest in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding.”","Thénardier continued: “Indeed! you might have cried thief a little, for I should not have found it inconvenient. Murder! that is said upon occasion, and, as far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that one should make a little noise when he finds himself with persons who do not inspire him with as much confidence as they might; you might have done it, and we should not have disturbed you. We would not even have gagged you. And I will tell you why. It is because this room is very deaf. That is all I can say for it, but I can say that. It is a cave. We could fire a bomb here, and at the nearest guardhouse it would sound like a drunkard’s snore. Here a cannon would go boom, and thunder would go puff. It is a convenient apartment. But, in short, you did not cry out, that was better, I make you my compliments for it, and I will tell you what I conclude from it: my dear monsieur, when a man cries out, who is it that comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! you did not cry out; because you were no more anxious than we to see justice and the police come. It is because,—I suspected as much long ago,—you have some interest in concealing something. For our part we have the same interest. Now we can come to an understanding.”"

"La diaphanéité de Babet contrastait avec la viande de Gueulemer. Babet était maigre et savant. Il était transparent, mais impénétrable. On voyait le jour à travers les os, mais rien à travers la prunelle. Il se déclarait chimiste. Il avait été pitre chez Bobèche et paillasse chez Bobino. Il avait joué le vaudeville à Saint-Mihiel. C’était un homme à intentions, beau parleur, qui soulignait ses sourires et guillemettait ses gestes. Son industrie était de vendre en plein vent des bustes de plâtre et des portraits du « chef de l’état ». De plus, il arrachait les dents. Il avait montré des phénomènes dans les foires, et possédé une baraque avec trompette et cette affiche : ― Babet, artiste dentiste, membre des académies, fait des expériences physiques sur métaux et métalloïdes, extirpe les dents, entreprend les chicots abandonnés par ses confrères. Prix : une dent, un franc cinquante centimes ; deux dents, deux francs ; trois dents, deux francs cinquante. Profitez de l’occasion. — (Ce « profitez de l’occasion » signifiait : faites-vous-en arracher le plus possible.) Il avait été marié et avait eu des enfants. Il ne savait pas ce que sa femme et ses enfants étaient devenus. Il les avait perdus comme on perd son mouchoir. Haute exception dans le monde obscur dont il était, Babet lisait les journaux. Un jour, du temps qu’il avait sa famille avec lui dans sa baraque roulante, il avait lu dans le Messager qu’une femme venait d’accoucher d’un enfant suffisamment viable, ayant un mufle de veau, et il s’était écrié : Voilà une fortune ! ce n’est pas ma femme qui aurait l’esprit de me faire un enfant comme cela !","The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the meat of Gueulemer. Babet was lean and learned. It was transparent, but impenetrable. Day was seen through the bones, but nothing through the eyeball. He called himself a chemist. He had been a clown at Bobèche and a straw man at Bobino. He had played vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of intentions, a smooth talker, who underlined his smiles and quoted his gestures. His industry was to sell plaster busts and portraits of the ""head of state"" in the open air. Plus, he was pulling teeth. He had shown phenomena at fairs, and owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster: ―Babet, dental artist, member of the academies, does physical experiments on metals and metalloids, pulls out teeth, undertakes snags abandoned by his colleagues. Price: one tooth, one franc fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs fifty. Take the opportunity. — (That “take the opportunity” meant: get ripped off as much as possible.) He had been married and had children. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses his handkerchief. A high exception in the obscure world of which he was, Babet read the newspapers. One day, when he had his family with him in his mobile barrack, he had read in the Messenger that a woman had just given birth to a sufficiently viable child, with a calf's muzzle, and he had exclaimed: That's a fortune! it's not my wife who would have the sense to give me a child like that!","Babet’s slightness contrasted with Gueulemer’s bulk. Babet was lean and canny. He was transparent but impenetrable. You could see daylight through his bones but nothing in his eyes. He declared himself a chemist. He had been a clown with Bobèche and a mountebank with Bobino. He had played in vaudeville at St-Mihiel. He was a man with designs, a fine talker, who underlined his smiles and put quotation marks around his gestures. He contrived to make a living as a street vendor, selling plaster busts and portraits of ‘the head of state’. He also pulled teeth. He had been a showman of freaks at fairs and had his own booth, with trumpet, and this poster: ‘Babet, Dentistry Artist, Member of the Academies, conducts physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, tackles stumps abandoned by fellow practitioners. Price: one tooth, one franc fifty centimes. Two teeth, two francs. Three teeth, two francs fifty. Take advantage of this bargain.’ (‘Take advantage of this bargain’ meant ‘Have as many pulled out as possible.’) He had been married and had children. He did not know what had become of his wife and offspring. He had lost them the way a person loses a handkerchief. A rare exception in the shady world to which he belonged, Babet read the newspapers. Once, in the days when he had his family with him in his travelling booth, he read in Le Messager that a woman had just given birth to a viable infant with the muzzle of a calf, and he exclaimed, ‘That’s worth a fortune! My wife wouldn’t have the wit to give me a child like that!’","The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. Babet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and portraits of “the head of the State.” In addition to this, he extracted teeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster: “Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the Academies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity.” This Take advantage of this opportunity meant: Have as many teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had children. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the world to which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a woman had just given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf’s muzzle, and he exclaimed: “There’s a fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that!”","The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the meatiness of Gueulemer. Babet was thin and shrewd. He was transparent, but impenetrable. You could see the light through his bones, but nothing through his eye. He professed to be a chemist. He had been bar-keeper for Bobèche, and clown for Bobino. He had played vaudeville at Saint Mihiel. He was an affected man, a great talker, who italicised his smiles and quoted his gestures. His business was to sell plaster busts and portraits of the “head of the Government” in the street. Moreover, he pulled teeth. He had exhibited monstrosities at fairs, and had a booth with a trumpet and this placard: “Babet, dental artist, member of the Academies, physical experimenter on metals and metalloids, extirpates teeth, removes stumps left by other dentists. Price: one tooth, one franc fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs fifty centimes. Improve your opportunity.” (This “improve your opportunity,” meant: “get as many pulled as possible.”) He had been married, and had had children. What had become of his wife and children, he did not know. He had lost them as one loses his pocket-handkerchief. A remarkable exception in the obscure world to which he belonged, Babet read the papers. One day during the time he had his family with him in his travelling booth he had read in the Messenger that a woman had been delivered of a child, likely to live, which had the face of a calf, and he had exclaimed: “There is a piece of good luck!

"A l’âge de seize ans, un soir, à l’Opéra, il avait eu l’honneur d’être lorgné à la fois par deux beautés alors mûres et célèbres et chantées par Voltaire, la Camargo et la Sallé. Pris entre deux feux, il avait fait une retraite héroïque vers une petite danseuse, fillette appelée Nahenry, qui avait seize ans comme lui, obscure comme un chat, et dont il était amoureux. Il abondait en souvenirs. Il s’écriait : ― Qu’elle était jolie, cette Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, la dernière fois que je l’ai vue à Longchamps, frisée en sentiments soutenus, avec ses venez-y-voir en turquoises, sa robe couleur de gens nouvellement arrivés, et son manchon d’agitation ! — Il avait porté dans son adolescence une veste de Nain-Londrin dont il parlait volontiers et avec effusion. ― J’étais vêtu comme un turc du Levant levantin, disait-il. Mme de Boufflers, l’ayant vu par hasard quand il avait vingt ans, l’avait qualifié « un fol charmant ». Il se scandalisait de tous les noms qu’il voyait dans la politique et au pouvoir, les trouvant bas et bourgeois. Il lisait les journaux, les papiers nouvelles, les gazettes, comme il disait, en étouffant des éclats de rire. Oh ! disait-il, quelles sont ces gens-là ! Corbière, Humann ! Casimir Périer ! cela vous est ministre. Je me figure ceci dans un journal : M. Gillenormand, ministre ! ce serait farce. Eh bien ! ils sont si bêtes que ça irait ! Il appelait allègrement toutes choses par le mot propre ou malpropre et ne se gênait pas devant les femmes. Il disait des grossièretés, des obscénités et des ordures avec je ne sais quoi de tranquille et de peu étonné qui était élégant. C’était le sans-façon de son siècle. Il est à remarquer que le temps des périphrases en vers a été le temps des crudités en prose. Son parrain avait prédit qu’il serait un homme de génie, et lui avait donné ces deux prénoms significatifs : Luc-Esprit.","At the age of sixteen, one evening at the Opera, he had had the honor of being ogled at the same time by two beauties then mature and famous and sung by Voltaire, La Camargo and La Sallé. Caught between two fires, he had made a heroic retreat towards a little dancer, a little girl called Nahenry, who was sixteen like him, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love. He was full of memories. He exclaimed: “How pretty she was, this Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps, curly with strong feelings, with her come-y-voirs in turquoise, her dress the color of newly arrived people, and her bustle sleeve! 'He had worn a Nain-Londrin jacket in his adolescence, of which he spoke willingly and with effusion. “I was dressed like a Turk from the Levantine Levant,” he said. Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty years old, had called him ""a crazy charming"". He was scandalized by all the names he saw in politics and in power, finding them low and bourgeois. He read the newspapers, the news papers, the gazettes, as he called it, stifling peals of laughter. Oh ! he said, who are these people! Corbiere, Humann! Casimir Perier! that is minister to you. I imagine this in a newspaper: M. Gillenormand, Minister! that would be a joke. Well ! they are so dumb it would be okay! He cheerfully called everything by the word clean or unclean and was not embarrassed in front of women. He said profanities, obscenities and garbage with something quiet and unsurprised that was elegant. It was the no-nonsense of his century. It should be noted that the time of periphrases in verse was the time of rawness in prose. His godfather had predicted that he would be a man of genius, and had given him these two significant first names: Luc-Esprit.","One evening at the Opéra at the age of sixteen he had the honour of being given the glad eye, simultaneously, by two famous beauties, then in their prime and celebrated by Voltaire, Camargo and Sallé. Caught in the crossfire, he had beaten a heroic retreat and fallen back on a young dancer, a little lass named Nahenry, who was sixteen, the same age as he was, a complete unknown, and with whom he was in love. He had memories galore. He would exclaim, ‘How charming she looked, that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps, her tresses in tightly curled ringlets, with her turquoise fascinator studs on the heels of her shoes, in her gown of a colour worn by the newly successful, and a muff for flourishing!’ As a youth he had worn a jacket of fine English cloth that he often spoke of with enthusiasm. ‘I was dressed like a Turk of the Levantine Levant,’ he would say. Madame de Boufflers, who happened to have seen him when he was twenty, described him as ‘a delightful madcap’. He was scandalized by all the names he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as low-class and bourgeois. He read the journals, ‘the news papers, the gazettes’, as he called them, stifling his explosions of laughter. ‘Oh!’ he would say. ‘Who are these people! Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! Ministers, would you believe! Imagine this appearing in a newspaper: “Monsieur Gillenormand, minister”! It would be a joke. Well! They’re so stupid, it would be taken seriously!’ He would gaily call all kinds of things by their proper or improper name, and was not in the least constrained by the presence of ladies. He would say things that were coarse, obscene and scurrilous with an air of ineffable composure and unconcern that was elegant. It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of the day. It is to be noted that the age of circumlocution in verse was the age of crudeness in prose. His godfather had predicted he would be a man of genius, and had given him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.","At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same time—ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the Camargo and the Sallé.

Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as “a charming fool.” He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. “Oh!” he said, “what people these are! Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! There’s a minister for you! I can imagine this in a journal: ‘M. Gillenorman, minister!’ that would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass”; he merrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century.

"Chez M. Gillenormand la douleur se traduisait en colère ; il était furieux d’être désespéré. Il avait tous les préjugés et prenait toutes les licences. Une des choses dont il composait son relief extérieur et sa satisfaction intime, c’était, nous venons de l’indiquer, d’être resté vert galant, et de passer énergiquement pour tel. Il appelait cela avoir « royale renommée ». La royale renommée lui attirait parfois de singulières aubaines. Un jour on apporta chez lui dans une bourriche, comme une cloyère d’huîtres, un gros garçon nouveau né, criant le diable et dûment emmitouflé de langes, qu’une servante chassée six mois auparavant lui attribuait. M. Gillenormand avait alors ses parfaits quatrevingt-quatre ans. Indignation et clameur dans l’entourage. Et à qui cette effrontée drôlesse espérait-elle faire accroire cela ? Quelle audace ! quelle abominable calomnie ! M. Gillenormand, lui, n’eut aucune colère. Il regarda le maillot avec l’aimable sourire d’un bonhomme flatté de la calomnie, et dit à la cantonade : « ― Eh bien, quoi ? qu’est-ce ? qu’y a-t-il ? qu’est-ce qu’il y a ? vous vous ébahissez bellement, et, en vérité, comme aucunes personnes ignorantes. Monsieur le duc d’Angoulême, bâtard de sa majesté Charles IX, se maria à quatrevingt-cinq ans avec une péronnelle de quinze ans ; monsieur Virginal, marquis d’Alluye, frère du cardinal de Sourdis, archevêque de Bordeaux, eut à quatrevingt-trois ans d’une fille de chambre de madame la présidente Jacquin un fils, un vrai fils d’amour, qui fut chevalier de Malte et conseiller d’état d’épée ; un des grands hommes de ce siècle-ci, l’abbé Tabaraud, est fils d’un homme de quatrevingt-sept ans. Ces choses-là n’ont rien que d’ordinaire. Et la Bible donc ! Sur ce, je déclare que ce petit monsieur n’est pas de moi. Qu’on en prenne soin. Ce n’est pas sa faute. » — Le procédé était débonnaire. La créature, celle-là qui se nommait Magnon, lui fit un deuxième envoi l’année d’après. C’était encore un garçon. Pour le coup M. Gillenormand capitula. Il remit à la mère les deux mioches, s’engageant à payer pour leur entretien quatrevingts francs par mois, à la condition que ladite mère ne recommencerait plus. Il ajouta : « J’entends que la mère les traite bien. Je les irai voir de temps en temps. » Ce qu’il fit. Il avait eu un frère prêtre, lequel avait été trente-trois ans recteur de l’académie de Poitiers, et était mort à soixante-dix-neuf ans. Je l’ai perdu jeune, disait-il. Ce frère, dont il est resté peu de souvenir, était un paisible avare, qui, étant prêtre, se croyait obligé de faire l’aumône aux pauvres qu’il rencontrait, mais il ne leur donnait jamais que des monnerons ou des sous démonétisés, trouvant ainsi moyen d’aller en enfer par le chemin du paradis. Quant à M. Gillenormand aîné, il ne marchandait pas l’aumône et donnait volontiers, et noblement. Il était bienveillant, brusque, charitable, et s’il eût été riche, sa pente eût été le magnifique. Il voulait que tout ce qui le concernait fût fait grandement, même les friponneries. Un jour, dans une succession, ayant été dévalisé par un homme d’affaires d’une manière grossière et visible, il jeta cette exclamation solennelle : ― « Fi ! c’est malproprement fait ! j’ai vraiment honte de ces grivelleries. Tout a dégénéré dans ce siècle, même les coquins. Morbleu ! ce n’est pas ainsi qu’on doit voler un homme de ma sorte. Je suis volé comme dans un bois, mais mal volé. Sylvæ sint consule dignæ ! » — Il avait eu, nous l’avons dit, deux femmes ; de la première une fille qui était restée fille, et de la seconde une autre fille, morte vers l’âge de trente ans, laquelle avait épousé par amour ou par hasard ou autrement un soldat de fortune qui avait servi dans les armées de la république et de l’empire, avait eu la croix à Austerlitz et avait été fait colonel à Waterloo. C’est la honte de ma famille, disait le vieux bourgeois. Il prenait force tabac et avait une grâce particulière à chiffonner son jabot de dentelle d’un revers de main. Il croyait fort peu en Dieu.","With M. Gillenormand pain was translated into anger; he was furious at being desperate. He had all the prejudices and took all the licenses. One of the things of which he composed his external relief and his inner satisfaction was, as we have just indicated, to have remained gallant green, and to pass energetically for such. He called it having “royal renown”. Royal renown sometimes brought him singular windfalls. One day they brought to his house in a hamper, like an oyster bed, a fat new-born boy, crying the devil and duly wrapped in swaddling clothes, which a servant, who had been chased out six months previously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand was then perfectly eighty-four years old. Indignation and clamor in the entourage. And who was this cheeky bitch hoping to make believe that? What audacity ! what abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand was not angry. He looked at the jersey with the amiable smile of a slander flattered fellow, and said to the crowd: ""Well, what? What is that ? what is it ? What's the matter ? you marvel beautifully, and, in truth, like no ignorant people. Monsieur le Duc d'Angoulême, bastard of His Majesty Charles IX, married at the age of eighty-five to a peronal of fifteen; Monsieur Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother of Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had at the age of eighty-three from a chambermaid of Madame President Jacquin a son, a true son of love, who was a Knight of Malta and epee state adviser; one of the great men of this century, Abbé Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. These things are nothing out of the ordinary. And so the Bible! With that, I declare that this little gentleman is not mine. Let us take care of it. It's not his fault. — The process was debonair. The creature, that one named Magnon, sent him a second shipment the following year. He was still a boy. For once M. Gillenormand capitulated. He handed over the two brats to the mother, pledging to pay for their upkeep eighty francs a month, on condition that the said mother would not do so again. He added: “I hear the mother treats them well. I will go see them from time to time. Which he did. He had had a priest brother, who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for thirty-three years, and had died at the age of seventy-nine. I lost him young, he said. This brother, of whom little memory remains, was a peaceful miser, who, being a priest, believed himself obliged to give alms to the poor he met, but he never gave them anything but monnerons or demonetized pennies, thus finding a way to go to hell by the way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand elder, he did not haggle over alms and gave willingly and nobly. He was benevolent, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his bent would have been magnificent. He wanted everything about him to be done grandly, even the cheatings. One day, in an estate, having been robbed by a businessman in a gross and conspicuous manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: ―“Fi! it's badly done! I'm really ashamed of this nonsense. Everything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! that's not the way to rob a man like me. I am robbed as in a wood, but badly robbed. Sylvæ sint consul dignæ! “He had, as we have said, two wives; of the first a girl who had remained a girl, and of the second another girl, who died around the age of thirty, who had married for love or by chance or otherwise a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the republic and of the empire, had had the cross at Austerlitz and had been made a colonel at Waterloo. It's the shame of my family, said the old bourgeois. He was taking strong tobacco and had a particular grace in crumpling his lace jabot with the back of his hand. He believed very little in God.","With Monsieur Gillenormand, sorrow translated into anger. Being in despair made him furious. He harboured every prejudice and took every liberty. One of the things on which he built his public persona and his private satisfaction was, as we have indicated, to have remained a lady’s man and lustily to pass for one. This he called having ‘royal status’. This royal status sometimes attracted some unexpected reversions to the Crown. One day a newborn baby boy, bawling his head off and neatly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, was brought to his house in a flat basket, like an oyster basket. A servant-girl who had been sacked six months earlier accused him of fathering it. Monsieur Gillenormand had then already turned eighty-four. Indignation and uproar in the household. And who did that brazen hussy hope to convince of that? What a nerve! What a dreadful slander! Monsieur Gillenormand himself was not at all annoyed. He observed the bundle with the amiable smile of a fellow flattered by the slander and said to anyone who was listening, ‘Well? So what? What of it? What’s the matter? You’re making such a fuss, and really behaving like ignoramuses. When he was eighty-five Monsieur le Duc d’Angoulême, the bastard son of His Majesty Charles IX, married a silly goose aged fifteen. Monsieur Virginal, Marquis d’Alluye, brother of Cardinal de Sourdis, archbishop of Bordeaux, at the age of eighty-three had a son by one of Madame la Présidente Jacquin’s chambermaids, a real love-child who became a Knight of Malta and a counsellor of state representing the old aristocracy. One of the great men of this century, Abbé Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary about any of these things. Just think of the Bible! On which I swear this little gentleman is not mine. Let him be taken care of. It’s not his fault.’ It was an accommodating solution. The woman in question, whose name was Magnon, sent him a second bundle the year after. It was another boy. This time Monsieur Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two infants back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance on condition the mother in question did not do it again. He added, ‘I expect the mother to treat them well. I shall go and see them from time to time.’ Which he did. He had a brother who for thirty-three years was a priest and rector of the academy at Poitiers, and who died at the age of seventy-nine. ‘I lost him when he was still young,’ he said. This brother, who is little remembered, was a complacent miser who, being a priest, felt obliged to give alms to the poor that he encountered, though he never gave them anything but worthless Revolutionary coins or demonetized sous, thereby contriving to go to hell by following the path to paradise. As for Monsieur Gillenormand the elder, he did not stint in giving to the poor but gave gladly and nobly. He was benevolent, bluff, charitable, and had he been rich his natural bent would have been princely open-handedness. He wanted everything that involved him to be done in style – even swindles. One day, having been crudely and blatantly cheated over an inheritance by a bailiff, he made this solemn protest: ‘Bah! That was indecently done! I’m truly ashamed of such fiddles. Everything has deteriorated during this century, even the crooks. By God! This is no way to rob a man of my standing. I’ve been robbed like a babe in the woods, in a shabby way. Silvae sint consule dignae!’ * As we have said, he was twice married. By his first wife he had a daughter, who had remained single, and by the second another daughter, who died at about the age of thirty. And for love or by chance or for some other reason, she had married a soldier of fortune who served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, won the Legion of Honour cross at Austerlitz and was made colonel at Waterloo. ‘ He’s the bane of my family,’ the old bourgeois would say. He took an immense amount of snuff and had a particularly graceful way of flicking the ruffle at his throat with the back of his hand. He was no great believer in God.","With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious at being in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he had remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for such. This he called having “royal renown.” This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully completed his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the establishment. And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand himself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an aside: “Well, what now? What’s the matter? You are finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d’Angoulême, the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d’Alluye, brother to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Présidente Jacquin, a son, a real child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of state; one of the great men of this century, the Abbé Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in these things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of. It is not his fault.” This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a boy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more. He added: “I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well. I shall go to see them from time to time.” And this he did. He had had a brother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years, and had died at seventy-nine. “I lost him young,” said he. This brother, of whom but little memory remains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he never haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent. He desired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner, even his rogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: “That was indecently done! I am really ashamed of this pilfering. Everything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is not the way to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, but badly robbed. Silvæ sint consule dignæ! ” He had had two wives, as we have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had died at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. “He is the disgrace of my family,” said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of snuff, and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. He believed very little in God.","AT Monsieur Gillenormand’s grief was translated into anger; he was furious at being in despair. He had every prejudice, and took every licence. One of the things of which he made up his external relief and his internal satisfaction was, we have just indicated, that he was still a youthful gallant, and that he passed for such energetically. He called this having “royal renown.” His royal renown sometimes attracted singular presents. One day there was brought to his house in a basket, something like an oyster basket, a big boy, new-born, crying like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling clothes, which a servant girl turned away six months before attributed to him. Monsieur Gillenormand was at that time fully eighty-four years old. Indignation and clamour on the part of the bystanders. And who did this bold wench think would believe this? What effrontery! What an abominable calumny! Monsieur Gillenormand, however, manifested no anger. He looked upon the bundle with the amiable smile of a man who is flattered by a calumny, and said aside: “Well, what? what is it? what is the matter there? what have we here? you are in a pretty state of amazement, and indeed seem like any ignorant people. The Duke d’Angoulême, natural son of his majesty Charles IX., married at eighty-five a little hussy of fifteen; Monsieur Virginal, Marquis d’Alhuye, brother of Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, at eighty-three, had, by a chambermaid of the wife of President Jacquin, a son, a true love son, who was a Knight of Malta, and knighted Councillor of State; one of the great men of this century, Abbé Tabarand, was the son of a man eighty-seven years old. These things are anything but uncommon. And then the Bible! Upon that, I declare that this little gentleman is not mine. But take care of him. It is not his fault.” This process was too easy. The creature, she whose name was Magnon, made him a second present the year after. It was a boy again. This time Monsieur Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats back to the mother, engaging to pay eighty francs a month for their support, upon condition that the said mother should not begin again. He added, “I wish the mother to treat them well. I will come to see them from time to time.” Which he did. He had had a brother, a priest, who had been for thirty-three years rector of the Academy of Poitiers, and who died at seventy-nine. “I lost him young,” said he. This brother, of whom hardly a memory is left, was a quiet miser, who, being a priest, felt obliged to give alms to the poor whom he met, but never gave them anything more than coppers or worn-out sous, finding thus the means of going to Hell by the road to Paradise. As to Monsieur Gillenormand, the elder, he made no trade of alms-giving, but gave willingly and nobly. He was benevolent, abrupt, charitable, and had he been rich, his inclination would have been to be magnificent. He wished that all that concerned him should be done in a large way, even rascalities. One day, having been swindled in an inheritance by a business man, in a gross and palpable manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: “Fie! this is not decent! I am really ashamed of these petty cheats. Everything is degenerate in this century, even the rascals. ’ Sdeath! this is not the way to rob a man like me. I am robbed as if in a wood, but meanly robbed. Silvæ sint consul dignæ!” He had had, we have said, two wives; by the first a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who died when about thirty years old, and who had married for love, or luck, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune, who had served in the armies of the republic and the empire, had won the cross at Austerlitz, and been made colonel at Waterloo. “This is the disgrace of my family,” said the old bourgeois. He took a great deal of snuff, and had a peculiar skill in ruffling his lace frill with the back of his hand. He had very little belief in God."

"Voir et montrer, cela même ne suffit pas. La philosophie doit être une énergie ; elle doit avoir pour effort et pour effet d’améliorer l’homme. Socrate doit entrer dans Adam et produire Marc-Aurèle ; en d’autres termes, faire sortir de l’homme de la félicité l’homme de la sagesse. Changer l’Éden en Lycée. La science doit être un cordial. Jouir, quel triste but et quelle ambition chétive ! La brute jouit. Penser, voilà le triomphe vrai de l’âme. Tendre la pensée à la soif des hommes, leur donner à tous en élixir la notion de Dieu, faire fraterniser en eux la conscience et la science, les rendre justes par cette confrontation mystérieuse, telle est la fonction de la philosophie réelle. La morale est un épanouissement de vérités. Contempler mène à agir. L’absolu doit être pratique. Il faut que l’idéal soit respirable, potable et mangeable à l’esprit humain. C’est l’idéal qui a le droit de dire : Prenez, ceci est ma chair, ceci est mon sang. La sagesse est une communion sacrée. C’est à cette condition qu’elle cesse d’être un stérile amour de la science pour devenir le mode un et souverain du ralliement humain, et que de philosophie elle est promue religion.","Seeing and showing is not enough. Philosophy must be an energy; it must have the effort and the effect of improving man. Socrates must enter Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in other words, to bring out of the man of happiness the man of wisdom. Change Eden to High School. Science must be a cordial. To enjoy, what a sad goal and what puny ambition! The brute enjoys. Thinking is the true triumph of the soul. To tend thought to the thirst of men, to give them all the elixir of the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize in them, to make them just by this mysterious confrontation, such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a flowering of truths. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute must be practical. The ideal must be breathable, drinkable and edible to the human mind. It is the ideal that has the right to say: Take, this is my flesh, this is my blood. Wisdom is a sacred communion. It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science to become the single and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that from philosophy it is promoted to religion.","It is not even enough to see and to tell. Philosophy must be a force of energy. To better mankind must be its endeavour and its effect. Socrates must enter Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in other words, out of the man of blissfulness bring forth the man of wisdom. Turn Eden into a Lyceum. Knowledge must be a tonic. The pursuit of pleasure – what a sorry purpose and what a paltry ambition! The brute beast pursues pleasure. The pursuit of thought, that is the soul’s real triumph! To offer thought to mankind’s thirst, to give as an elixir to all men the notion of God, to bring together within them conscience and knowledge, and by this mysterious conjunction to make them just, such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a flourishing of truths. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute must be applicable. The ideal must be breathable, drinkable and eatable to the human mind. It is the ideal that has the right to say: ‘Take this, this is my body, this is my blood.’ Wisdom is a holy communion. It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of knowledge and becomes the one sovereign mode of inspiring human solidarity, and is elevated from philosophy to religion.","Even to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an energy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be a cordial. To enjoy,—what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! The brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize in them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It is necessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable to the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this is my body, this is my blood. Wisdom is holy communion. It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion.","To behold and to show forth, even these will not suffice. Philosophy should be an energy; it should find its aim and its effect in the amelioration of mankind. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius—in other words, bring forth from the man of enjoyment, the man of wisdom—and change Eden into the Lyceum. Science should be a cordial, Enjoyment! What wretched aim, and what pitiful ambition! The brute enjoys. Thought, this is the true triumph of the soul. To proffer thought to the thirst of men, to give to all, as an elixir, the idea of God, to cause conscience and science to fraternise in them, and to make them good men by this mysterious confrontation—such is the province of true philosophy. Morality is truth in full bloom. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practical. The ideal must be made air and food and drink to the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take of it , this is my flesh, this is my blood. Wisdom is a sacred communion. It is upon that condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science, and becomes the one and supreme method by which to rally humanity; from philosophy it is promoted to religion."

"― Des canons dans la cour du Muséum ! pourquoi faire ? Canon, que me veux-tu ? Vous voulez donc mitrailler l’Apollon du Belvédère ? Qu’est-ce que les gargousses ont à faire avec la Vénus de Médicis ? Oh ! ces jeunes gens d’à présent, tous des chenapans ! Quel pas grand’chose que leur Benjamin Constant ! Et ceux qui ne sont pas des scélérats sont des dadais ! Ils font tout ce qu’ils peuvent pour être laids, ils sont mal habillés, ils ont peur des femmes, ils ont autour des cotillons un air de mendier qui fait éclater de rire les jeannetons ; ma parole d’honneur, on dirait les pauvres honteux de l’amour. Ils sont difformes, et ils se complètent en étant stupides ; ils répètent les calembours de Tiercelin et de Potier, ils ont des habits-sacs, des gilets de palefrenier, des chemises de grosse toile, des pantalons de gros drap, des bottes de gros cuir, et le ramage ressemble au plumage. On pourrait se servir de leur jargon pour ressemeler leurs savates. Et toute cette inepte marmaille vous a des opinions politiques. Il devrait être sévèrement défendu d’avoir des opinions politiques. Ils fabriquent des systèmes, ils refont la société, ils démolissent la monarchie, ils flanquent par terre toutes les lois, ils mettent le grenier à la place de la cave et mon portier à la place du roi, ils bousculent l’Europe de fond en comble, ils rebâtissent le monde, et ils ont pour bonne fortune de regarder sournoisement les jambes des blanchisseuses qui remontent dans leurs charrettes ! Ah ! Marius ! ah ! gueusard ! aller vociférer en place publique ! discuter, débattre, prendre des mesures ! ils appellent cela des mesures, justes dieux ! le désordre se rapetisse et devient niais. J’ai vu le chaos, je vois le gâchis. Des écoliers délibérer sur la garde nationale, cela ne se verrait pas chez les ogibewas et chez les cadodaches ! Les sauvages qui vont tout nus, la caboche coiffée comme un volant de raquette, avec une massue à la patte, sont moins brutes que ces bacheliers-là ! Des marmousets de quatre sous ! ça fait les entendus et les jordonnes ! ça délibère et ratiocine ! C’est la fin du monde. C’est évidemment la fin de ce misérable globe terraqué. Il fallait un hoquet final, la France le pousse. Délibérez, mes drôles ! Ces choses-là arriveront tant qu’ils iront lire les journaux sous les arcades de l’Odéon. Cela leur coûte un sou, et leur bon sens, et leur intelligence, et leur cœur, et leur âme, et leur esprit. On sort de là, et l’on fiche le camp de chez sa famille.

So you want to strafe the Apollo Belvedere? What do gargoyles have to do with the Venus de' Medici? Oh ! these young people now, all scoundrels! What not much is their Benjamin Constant! And those who are not scoundrels are boobies! They do everything they can to be ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, they have a begging air around their petticoats which makes the youngsters burst into laughter; on my word of honour, they look like the poor ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they complement each other by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and Potier, they have coat-sacks, groom's waistcoats, coarse linen shirts, coarse cloth trousers, coarse leather boots, and the ramage resembles the plumage.

It was like this : I went inside the church, he was in his usual place, I greeted him politely and handed him the letter, he read it and said, “Where do you live, my child?” I said, “Monsieur, I’ll take you there.” He said, “No, give me your address, my daughter has some shopping to do, I’ll take a cab and I’ll get to your house at the same time as you.” I gave him the address. When I told him which house it was he seemed surprised, and hesitated for a bit, then he said, “It makes no difference, I’ll go.” At the end of the mass I saw him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw them climb into a cab. And I did tell him, the last door on the right at the end of the corridor.’","“Ta, ta, ta,” said the girl, “how you do gallop on, my good man! See here: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a reverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me: ‘Where do you live, my child?’ I said: ‘Monsieur, I will show you.’ He said to me: ‘No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do.’ I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: ‘Never mind, I will come.’ When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor, on the right.”","“Tut, tut, tut!” said the girl, “how you run on, goodman! I’ll tell you: I went into the church, he was at his usual place, I made a curtsey to him, and I gave him the letter, he read it and said to me: Where do you live, my child? I said: Monsieur, I will show you. He said to me: No, give me your address; my daughter has some purchases to make, I am going to take a carriage and I will get to your house as soon as you do. I gave him the address. When I told him the house, he appeared surprised and hesitated an instant, then he said: It is all the same, I will go. When mass was over, I saw him leave the church with his daughter. I saw them get into a fiacre. And I told him plainly the last door at the end of the hall on the right.”"

"Une nuit, il était seul dans sa petite chambre située sous le toit. Sa bougie était allumée ; il lisait accoudé sur sa table à côté de sa fenêtre ouverte. Toutes sortes de rêveries lui arrivaient de l’espace et se mêlaient à sa pensée. Quel spectacle que la nuit ! on entend des bruits sourds sans savoir d’où ils viennent, on voit rutiler comme une braise Jupiter qui est douze cents fois plus gros que la terre, l’azur est noir, les étoiles brillent, c’est formidable.","One night, he was alone in his small bedroom under the roof. His candle was lit; he was reading, leaning on his table beside his open window. All sorts of daydreams came to him from space and mingled with his thoughts. What a sight that night! we hear muffled noises without knowing where they come from, we see gleaming like an ember Jupiter which is twelve hundred times bigger than the earth, the azure is black, the stars shine, it's wonderful.","One night he was alone in his small bedroom under the eaves. His candle was lit. He was leaning on his elbows, reading, at the table by his open window. All sorts of fanciful notions came to him from outer space and mingled with his thoughts.

It is magnificent.","One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle was burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and mingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.","One night he was alone in his little room next the roof.

"― La pelure est trop large. ― C’est égal, ajouta-t-il, il a diablement bien fait de me la laisser, le vieux coquin ! Sans cela je n’aurais pas pu sortir et tout aurait encore manqué ! A quoi les choses tiennent pourtant !","―The peel is too wide. ""It doesn't matter,"" he added, ""he did the devilish good thing to leave her to me, the old rascal!"" Without that I would not have been able to go out and everything would still have failed! How do things hold up!","Never mind ,’ he added, ‘it was a damn good thing he left it for me, the old crook! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to go out and everything would have come to nothing again! When you think what things can turn on!’","“This rind is too large for me. Never mind,” he added, “he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it hadn’t been for that, I couldn’t have gone out, and everything would have gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!”","“The skin is too large. It is all the same,” added he, “he did devilish well to leave it for me, the old scoundrel!

"La mère, qui n’avait pas encore dit un mot, se souleva et demanda d’une voix lente et sourde et dont les paroles semblaient sortir comme figées :","The mother, who had not yet said a word, got up and asked in a slow, muffled voice, the words of which seemed to come out as frozen:","The mother, who had so far said nothing, now rose, and in words that came out sounding almost expressionless asked in a slow, dull voice, ‘What are you trying to do, dear?’","The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in a dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state:—","The mother, who had not yet said a word, got up and asked in a slow, muffled tone, her words seeming to come out as if curdled:"

"A mesure qu’il approchait, son pas se ralentissait de plus en plus. Parvenu à une certaine distance du banc, bien avant d’être à la fin de l’allée, il s’arrêta, et il ne put savoir lui-même comment il se fit qu’il rebroussa chemin. Il ne se dit même point qu’il n’allait pas jusqu’au bout. Ce fut à peine si la jeune fille put l’apercevoir de loin et voir le bel air qu’il avait dans ses habits neufs. Cependant il se tenait très droit, pour avoir bonne mine dans le cas où quelqu’un qui serait derrière lui le regarderait.","As he approached, his step slowed more and more. Reaching a certain distance from the bench, long before he was at the end of the aisle, he stopped, and he could not himself know how he came to turn back. He didn't even say to himself that he wasn't going to the end. The young girl could hardly see him from a distance and see the handsome air he had in his new clothes. However, he held himself very straight, so as to look good in case someone behind him looked at him.","As he drew nearer, his pace became slower and slower. When he got to a certain distance from the bench, and long before he had reached the end of the path, he stopped, and was himself at a loss to know why it was that he turned and retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he was not going right to the end. The girl could hardly have noticed him from so far away or seen how fine he looked in his new clothes. Yet he held himself very erect in case there should be anyone looking at him from behind.","In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On arriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had reached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind.","As he drew nearer, his step became slower and slower. At some distance from the seat, long before he had reached the end of the walk, he stopped, and he did not know himself how it happened, but he turned back. He did not even say to himself that he would not go to the end. It was doubtful if the young girl could see him so far off, and notice his fine appearance in his new suit. However, he held himself very straight, so that he might look well, in case anybody who was behind should happen to notice him."
"D’un côté des miasmes, de l’autre un ineffable parfum. D’un côté une peste morale, gardée à vue, parquée sous le canon, et dévorant lentement ses pestiférés ; de l’autre un chaste embrasement de toutes les âmes dans le même foyer.

"Les claustrations ont fait leur temps. Les cloîtres, utiles à la première éducation de la civilisation moderne, ont été gênants pour sa croissance et sont nuisibles à son développement.

"Fils d’un père auquel l’histoire accordera certainement les circonstances atténuantes, mais aussi digne d’estime que ce père avait été digne de blâme ; ayant toutes les vertus privées et plusieurs des vertus publiques ;

couchant avec sa femme, et ayant dans son palais des laquais chargés de faire voir le lit conjugal aux bourgeois, ostentation d’alcôve régulière devenue utile après les anciens étalages illégitimes de la branche aînée ; sachant toutes les langues de l’Europe et, ce qui est plus rare, tous les langages de tous les intérêts, et les parlant ; admirable représentant de « la classe moyenne », mais la dépassant, et de toutes les façons plus grand qu’elle ; ayant l’excellent esprit, tout en appréciant le sang dont il sortait, de se compter surtout pour sa valeur intrinsèque, et, sur la question même de sa race, très particulier, se déclarant Orléans et non Bourbon ; très premier prince du sang tant qu’il n’avait été qu’altesse sérénissime, mais franc bourgeois le jour où il fut majesté ; diffus en public, concis dans l’intimité ; avare signalé, mais non prouvé ; au fond, un de ces économes aisément prodigues pour leur fantaisie ou leur devoir ; lettré, et peu sensible aux lettres ; gentilhomme, mais non chevalier ; simple, calme et fort ; adoré de sa famille et de sa maison ; causeur séduisant, homme d’état désabusé, intérieurement froid, dominé par l’intérêt immédiat, gouvernant toujours au plus près, incapable de rancune et de reconnaissance, usant sans pitié les supériorités sur les médiocrités, habile à faire donner tort par les majorités parlementaires à ces unanimités mystérieuses qui grondent sourdement sous les trônes ; expansif, parfois imprudent dans son expansion, mais d’une merveilleuse adresse dans cette imprudence ; fertile en expédients, en visages, en masques ; faisant peur à la France de l’Europe et à l’Europe de la France ; aimant incontestablement son pays, mais préférant sa famille ; prisant plus la domination que l’autorité et l’autorité que la dignité, disposition qui a cela de funeste que, tournant tout au succès, elle admet la ruse et ne répudie pas absolument la bassesse, mais qui a cela de profitable qu’elle préserve la politique des chocs violents, l’état des fractures et la société des catastrophes ; minutieux, correct, vigilant, attentif, sagace, infatigable, se contredisant quelquefois, et se démentant ; hardi contre l’Autriche à Ancône, opiniâtre contre l’Angleterre en Espagne, bombardant Anvers et payant Pritchard ; chantant avec conviction la Marseillaise ; inaccessible à l’abattement, aux lassitudes, au goût du beau et de l’idéal, aux générosités téméraires, à l’utopie, à la chimère, à la colère, à la vanité, à la crainte ; ayant toutes les formes de l’intrépidité personnelle ; général à Valmy, soldat à Jemmapes ; tâté huit fois par le régicide, et toujours souriant ; brave comme un grenadier, courageux comme un penseur ; inquiet seulement devant les chances d’un ébranlement européen, et impropre aux grandes aventures politiques ; toujours prêt à risquer sa vie, jamais son œuvre ; déguisant sa volonté en influence afin d’être plutôt obéi comme intelligence que comme roi ; doué d’observation et non de divination ; peu attentif aux esprits, mais se connaissant en hommes, c’est-à-dire ayant besoin de voir pour juger ; bon sens prompt et pénétrant, sagesse pratique, parole facile, mémoire prodigieuse ; puisant sans cesse dans cette mémoire, son unique point de ressemblance avec César, Alexandre et Napoléon ; sachant les faits, les détails, les dates, les noms propres, ignorant les tendances, les passions, les génies divers de la foule, les aspirations intérieures, les soulèvements cachés et obscurs des âmes, en un mot, tout ce qu’on pourrait appeler les courants invisibles des consciences ; accepté par la surface, mais peu d’accord avec la France de dessous ; s’en tirant par la finesse ; gouvernant trop et ne régnant pas assez ; son premier ministre à lui-même ; excellant à faire de la petitesse des réalités un obstacle à l’immensité des idées ; mêlant à une vraie faculté créatrice de civilisation, d’ordre et d’organisation on ne sait quel esprit de procédure et de chicane ; fondateur et procureur d’une dynastie ; ayant quelque chose de Charlemagne et quelque chose d’un avoué ; en somme, figure haute et originale, prince qui sut faire du pouvoir malgré l’inquiétude de la France, et de la puissance malgré la jalousie de l’Europe, Louis-Philippe sera classé parmi les hommes éminents de son siècle, et serait rangé parmi les gouvernants les plus illustres de l’histoire, s’il eût un peu aimé la gloire et s’il eût eu le sentiment de ce qui est grand au même degré que le sentiment de ce qui est utile.","Son of a father to whom history will certainly accord the extenuating circumstances, but as worthy of esteem as that father had been worthy of blame; having all the private virtues and many of the public virtues; careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs; knowing the price of a minute and not always the price of a year; sober, serene, peaceful, patient; good man and good prince; sleeping with his wife, and having lackeys in his palace charged with showing the marital bed to the bourgeois, a regular alcove ostentation which had become useful after the old illegitimate displays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe and, what is rarer, all the languages of all interests, and speaking them; admirable representative of ""the middle class"", but exceeding it, and in every way greater than it; having the excellent mind, while appreciating the blood from which he came, to count himself above all for his intrinsic value, and, on the very question of his race, very particular, declaring himself Orléans and not Bourbon; very first prince of the blood as long as he had been only serene highness, but frank bourgeois the day when he became majesty; diffuse in public, concise in private; avaricious reported, but unproven; basically, one of those bursaries easily prodigal for their fancy or their duty; literate, and little sensitive to letters; gentleman, but not knight; simple, calm and strong; adored by family and household; attractive conversationalist, disillusioned statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing closely, incapable of resentment and gratitude, mercilessly using superiority over mediocrity, skilful in making parliamentary majorities prove wrong to those mysterious unanimities which rumble dully under the thrones; expansive, sometimes reckless in its expansion, but wonderfully skillful in that recklessness; fertile in expedients, faces, masks; scaring the France of Europe and the Europe of France; unquestionably loving his country, but preferring his family; valuing domination more than authority, and authority more than dignity, a disposition which has this fatal aspect that, turning everything to success, it admits cunning and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but which has this preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures and society from catastrophes; meticulous, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable, sometimes contradicting himself, and contradicting himself; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp and paying off Pritchard; singing with conviction the Marseillaise; inaccessible to dejection, to weariness, to the taste for beauty and the ideal, to reckless generosity, to utopia, to chimera, to anger, to vanity, to fear; having all forms of personal fearlessness; general at Valmy, soldier at Jemmapes; touched eight times by the regicide, and always smiling; brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; worried only about the chances of a European shock, and unfit for great political adventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising his will as influence so as to be obeyed rather as an intelligence than as a king; endowed with observation and not with divination; little attentive to spirits, but knowing themselves in men, that is to say needing to see in order to judge; quick and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; constantly drawing from this memory, his unique point of resemblance to Caesar, Alexander and Napoleon; knowing the facts, the details, the dates, the proper names, ignoring the tendencies, the passions, the various geniuses of the crowd, the inner aspirations, the hidden and obscure upheavals of souls, in a word, everything one could call the invisible currents of consciousness; accepted by the surface, but little agreement with France below; getting away with finesse; governing too much and not reigning enough; his prime minister to himself; excelling in making the smallness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas; mixing with a real creative faculty of civilization, order and organization who knows what spirit of procedure and chicanery; founder and procurator of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who knew how to wield power despite the anxiety of France, and power despite the jealousy of Europe, Louis-Philippe will be ranked among the eminent men of his century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious rulers in history, if he had loved glory a little and if he had had the feeling of what is great to the same degree as the feeling of what is useful.","Son of a father to whom history will surely grant extenuating circumstances, but as worthy of esteem as that father had been worthy of blame. Possessing all the private virtues and several of the public ones. Mindful of his health, his fortune, his own person, his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year. Sober, serene, peaceable, patient. A good fellow and a good prince. One who slept with his own wife and had footmen in his palace detailed to show respectable citizens the conjugal bed, a regular display of his private life that proved useful after the extra-conjugal spectacles of the senior branch in the past. Who had a command of all European languages, and rarer still all languages of all interest groups, and spoke them. An admirable representative of the ‘middle class’, but surpassing it and in every way superior to it. While appreciating his ancestry, having the extremely good sense to set greatest store by his own intrinsic worth, and on the actual question of his lineage being most particular to declare himself Orléans and not Bourbon. Very much the first Prince of the Blood while still only His Most Serene Highness, but ordinary citizen from the day he became His Majesty. Long-winded in public, succinct in private. Alleged, but not proven, to be a miser. Basically, one of those thrifty types with a readiness to be unsparing when the fancy takes them or when it is expected of them. Well read, but with little feeling for literature. A gentleman but no cavalier. Unpretentious, calm, strong. Adored by his family and his household. An engaging conversationalist, a statesman with no illusions, inwardly cold, ruled by immediate priorities, governing always in the short term, incapable of resentment or of gratitude, ruthless in deploying superiority against mediocrity, clever at getting parliamentary majorities to condemn those mysterious unanimities grumbling darkly beneath thrones. Expansive, sometimes imprudent in his expansiveness, but with marvellous adroitness in that imprudence. Rich in resourcefulness, with many faces and many masks. Instilling a fear of Europe in France and a fear of France in Europe! A man who undeniably loved his country but preferred his family. Valuing domination more than authority and authority more than dignity, a pernicious tendency in this respect: that in the interests of success, it sanctions guile and does not absolutely repudiate baseness. But advantageous in this: that it protects politics from violent upheaval, the state from fracturing, and society from catastrophe. Meticulous, punctilious, vigilant, careful, shrewd, indefatigable. Sometimes inconsistent and contradicting himself. Bold against Austria at Ancona, determined against England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp and paying off Pritchard. Singing the ‘Marseillaise’ with conviction. Incapable of despondency or lassitude, of any sense of the beautiful or the ideal, of reckless generosity, Utopianism, illusion, anger, vanity, fear. Possessing all manner of personal fearlessness, a general at Valmy, a soldier at Jemappes. Eight times targeted by regicides, and always smiling. Brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker, anxious only at the prospect of European turmoil, and unsuited for great political adventures. Always ready to risk his life, never his work. Disguising his will as influence so as to be obeyed for what he thought rather than as king. With a gift for observation but not for anticipation. Not much interested in people in the abstract but a good judge of men; that is to say, he relied on what he saw to make a judgement. A fluent speaker, of quick and discerning good sense, practical wisdom and prodigious memory. Drawing incessantly on this memory, his sole point of resemblance to Caesar, Alexander and Napoleon. Knowing facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the various moods of the crowd, inward aspirations, the hidden and obscure stirrings within souls – in a word, everything that could be called the invisible currents of consciousness. Accepted at a superficial level, but not much in sympathy with the underlying France. Managing to survive through cunning. Governing too much and not ruling enough. His own first minister. Singularly successful at forging out of the pettiness of reality an obstacle to the greatness of ideas. Combining with a real creative capacity for civilization, order and organization a kind of bureaucratic and pettifogging attitude. Founder and promoter of a dynasty. With something of a Charlemagne and something of a lawyer about him. In short, a distinguished and exceptional individual, a prince who managed to exert authority despite France’s misgivings and to show strength in spite of Europe’s distrust. Louis-Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his age, and would be ranked among the most illustrious rulers in history if he had cared a little for glory, and if his sense of what was great had been equal to his sense of what was useful.","The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and, what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking them; an admirable representative of the “middle class,” but outstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race, very particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public, concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman, but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family and his household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor and of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in countenances, in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family; assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity, a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns everything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, to chimæras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up, and unfitted for great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king; endowed with observation and not with divination; not very attentive to minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order to judge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, his only point of resemblance with Cæsar, Alexander, and Napoleon; knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord with France lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing too much and not enough; his own first minister; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order and organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the founder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe.

"Vers 1830, son frère le curé était mort, et presque tout de suite, comme lorsque la nuit vient, tout l’horizon s’était assombri pour M. Mabeuf. Une faillite — de notaire — lui enleva une somme de dix mille francs, qui était tout ce qu’il possédait du chef de son frère et du sien. La révolution de Juillet amena une crise dans la librairie. En temps de gêne, la première chose qui ne se vend pas, c’est une Flore. La Flore des environs de Cauteretz s’arrêta court. Des semaines s’écoulaient sans un acheteur. Quelquefois M. Mabeuf tressaillait à un coup de sonnette. ― Monsieur, lui disait tristement la mère Plutarque, c’est le porteur d’eau. — Bref, un jour M. Mabeuf quitta la rue Mézières, abdiqua les fonctions de marguillier, renonça à Saint-Sulpice, vendit une partie, non de ses livres, mais de ses estampes, — ce à quoi il tenait le moins, — et s’alla installer dans une petite maison du boulevard Montparnasse, où du reste il ne demeura qu’un trimestre, pour deux raisons : premièrement, le rez-de-chaussée et le jardin coûtaient trois cents francs et il n’osait pas mettre plus de deux cents francs à son loyer ; deuxièmement, étant voisin du tir Fatou, il entendait des coups de pistolet ; ce qui lui était insupportable.","Around 1830, his brother the priest had died, and almost immediately, as when night comes, the whole horizon had darkened for M. Mabeuf. A bankruptcy—as a notary—deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all he possessed on his brother's and his own. The July Revolution brought about a crisis in the library. In times of embarrassment, the first thing that does not sell is a Flora. The Flora of the surroundings of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed without a buyer. Sometimes M. Mabeuf trembled at the ringing of the bell. “Monsieur,” said Mother Plutarch to him sadly, “he is the water carrier. — In short, one day M. Mabeuf left the rue Mézières, abdicated the functions of churchwarden, renounced Saint-Sulpice, sold part, not of his books, but of his prints — which he valued the least — and went to live in a small house on the boulevard Montparnasse, where, moreover, he only stayed for a quarter, for two reasons: firstly, the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he dared not spend more. two hundred francs to his rent; secondly, being close to the Fatou shot, he heard pistol shots; which was unbearable to him.","His brother the parish priest died in about 1830 and almost immediately, as when night falls, the whole horizon darkened for Monsieur Mabeuf. A bankruptcy – of a lawyer – deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was everything he possessed both in his brother’s right and in his own. The July Revolution brought a slump in the book trade. When times are hard the first thing that does not sell is a Flora. Sales of the Flora of the Environs of Cauterets dried up completely. Weeks went by without a single buyer. Sometimes Monsieur Mabeuf started at the sound of the doorbell. ‘Monsieur,’ Mère Plutarque would say sadly, ‘it’s the water-carrier.’ In short, one day Monsieur Mabeuf left Rue Mézières, resigned from his job as churchwarden, gave up St-Sulpice, sold not his books but some of his prints, those he was least attached to, and moved into a small house on Rue Montparnasse, where, though, he stayed only three months, and for two reasons. Firstly, the ground floor with garden cost three hundred francs and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent. Secondly, being next door to Fatou’s shooting range, he heard pistol-shots all day long, which he could not bear.","His brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M.

"A force de travail, de persévérance, d’attention et de seaux d’eau, il avait réussi à créer après le créateur, et il avait inventé de certaines tulipes et de certains dahlias qui semblaient avoir été oubliés par la nature. Il était ingénieux ; il avait devancé Soulange Bodin dans la formation des petits massifs de terre de bruyère pour la culture des rares et précieux arbustes d’Amérique et de Chine. Dès le point du jour, en été, il était dans ses allées, piquant, taillant, sarclant, arrosant, marchant au milieu de ses fleurs avec un air de bonté, de tristesse et de douceur, quelquefois rêveur et immobile des heures entières, écoutant le chant d’un oiseau dans un arbre, le gazouillement d’un enfant dans une maison, ou bien les yeux fixés au bout d’un brin d’herbe sur quelque goutte de rosée dont le soleil faisait une escarboucle. Il avait une table fort maigre, et buvait plus de lait que de vin. Un marmot le faisait céder, sa servante le grondait. Il était timide jusqu’à sembler farouche, sortait rarement, et ne voyait personne que les pauvres qui frappaient à sa vitre et son curé, l’abbé Mabeuf, bon vieux homme. Pourtant si des habitants de la ville ou des étrangers, les premiers venus, curieux de voir ses tulipes et ses roses, venaient sonner à sa petite maison, il ouvrait sa porte en souriant. C’était le brigand de la Loire.","By dint of work, perseverance, attention and buckets of water, he had succeeded in creating after the creator, and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature. He was resourceful; he had preceded Soulange Bodin in the formation of small beds of heather soil for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. From daybreak, in summer, he was in his paths, pricking, pruning, weeding, watering, walking among his flowers with an air of kindness, sadness and gentleness, sometimes dreamy and motionless for whole hours, listening the song of a bird in a tree, the chirping of a child in a house, or else the eyes fixed at the end of a blade of grass on some drop of dew which the sun made a carbuncle.

He was ingenious; he had anticipated Soulange Bodin in creating little mounds of peat for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. In summer he was out in his garden from the crack of dawn, planting, pruning, weeding, watering the borders, walking among his flowers with a sad, gentle, kindly air, sometimes daydreaming and motionless for hours on end, listening to the song of a bird in a tree, the babble of a child inside a house, or else gazing transfixed at a dewdrop on the tip of a blade of grass, made jewel-like by the sun. He ate very frugally and drank more milk than wine. He would defer to a small child; his servant scolded him.

"Ceci n’a rien que de très logique. On a beau n’avoir point de miroir au couvent, les femmes ont une conscience pour leur figure ; or, les filles qui se sentent jolies se laissent malaisément faire religieuses ; la vocation étant assez volontiers en proportion inverse de la beauté, on espère plus des laides que des belles. De là un goût vif pour les laiderons.","This only makes a lot of sense. Although there is no mirror in the convent, the women have a conscience for their faces; now, girls who feel pretty are hard pressed to become nuns; the vocation being readily enough in inverse proportion to the beauty, one hopes more for the ugly than for the beautiful. Hence a keen taste for ugliness.","There is nothing very logical about this. It is all very well having no mirror in the convent, women have an awareness about their faces. Now, girls who feel pretty are less likely to be recruited as nuns. A vocation being the more gladly accepted in inverse proportion to beauty, the ugly are a more hopeful prospect than the pretty. Hence a strong preference for the plain.","There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this. It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are conscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.","There is nothing not entirely logical in this. It is all in vain to have no mirrors in convents; women are conscious of their own appearance; young girls who know that they are pretty do not readily become nuns; the inclination to the calling being in inverse proportion to good looks, more is expected from the homely than from the handsome ones. Hence a marked preference for the homely."

"Les monastères, quand ils abondent chez une nation, sont des nœuds à la circulation, des établissements encombrants, des centres de paresse là où il faut des centres de travail. Les communautés monastiques sont à la grande communauté sociale ce que le gui est au chêne, ce que la verrue est au corps humain. Leur prospérité et leur embonpoint sont l’appauvrissement du pays. Le régime monacal, bon au début des civilisations, utile à produire la réduction de la brutalité par le spirituel, est mauvais à la virilité des peuples. En outre, lorsqu’il se relâche, et qu’il entre dans sa période de dérèglement, comme il continue à donner l’exemple, il devient mauvais par toutes les raisons qui le faisaient salutaire dans sa période de pureté.","Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are traffic nodes, cumbersome establishments, centers of laziness where centers of work are needed. Monastic communities are to the greater social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity and their plumpness are the impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the beginning of civilizations, useful in producing the spiritual reduction of brutality, is bad for the virility of peoples. Moreover, when he slackens and enters his period of disorder, as he continues to set an example, he becomes evil for all the reasons that made him wholesome in his period of purity.","When there are too many monasteries in a nation they are obstructions to the normal functioning of the system, otiose establishments, centres of idleness where centres of occupation should exist. Monastic communities are to the great social community what mistletoe is to the oak tree, what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity and satisfied well-being are the land’s impoverishment. Good in the first stage of civilizations, useful in bringing about the reduction of brutality through spirituality, the monastic regime is bad for nations in their maturity. Moreover, because it still continues to set the example when it grows lax and enters its era of dissoluteness, it becomes bad for all the reasons that made it beneficial in its era of untainted virtue.","Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in its circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the beginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover, when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of disorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity, because it still continues to set the example.","Monasteries, when they are numerous in a country, are knots in the circulation; encumbrances, centres of indolence, where there should be centres of industry. Monastic communities are to the great social community what the ivy is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body. There prosperity and fatness are the impoverishment of the country. The monastic system, useful as it is in the dawn of civilisation, in effecting the abatement of brutality by the development of the spiritual, is injurious in the manhood of nations. Especially when it relaxes and enters upon its period of disorganisation, the period in which we now see it, does it become baneful, for every reason that made it salutary, in its period of purity."

"Qu’a-t-il contre lui ? Ce trône. Otez de Louis-Philippe le roi, il reste l’homme. Et l’homme est bon. Il est bon parfois jusqu’à être admirable. Souvent, au milieu des plus graves soucis, après une journée de lutte contre toute la diplomatie du continent, il rentrait le soir dans son appartement, et là, épuisé de fatigue, accablé de sommeil, que faisait-il ? il prenait un dossier, et il passait sa nuit à reviser un procès criminel, trouvant que c’était quelque chose de tenir tête à l’Europe, mais que c’était une plus grande affaire encore d’arracher un homme au bourreau. Il s’opiniâtrait contre son garde des sceaux ; il disputait pied à pied le terrain de la guillotine aux procureurs généraux, ces bavards de la loi, comme il les appelait. Quelquefois les dossiers empilés couvraient sa table ; il les examinait tous ; c’était une angoisse pour lui d’abandonner ces misérables têtes condamnées. Un jour il disait au même témoin que nous avons indiqué tout à l’heure : Cette nuit, j’en ai gagné sept. Pendant les premières années de son règne, la peine de mort fut comme abolie, et l’échafaud relevé fut une violence faite au roi. La Grève ayant disparu avec la branche aînée, une Grève bourgeoise fut instituée sous le nom de Barrière Saint-Jacques ; les « hommes pratiques » sentirent le besoin d’une guillotine quasi légitime ; et ce fut là une des victoires de Casimir Perier, qui représentait les côtés étroits de la bourgeoisie, sur Louis-Philippe, qui en représentait les côtés libéraux. Louis-Philippe avait annoté de sa main Beccaria. Après la machine Fieschi, il s’écriait : Quel dommage que je n’aie pas été blessé ! j’aurais pu faire grâce. Une autre fois, faisant allusion aux résistances de ses ministres, il écrivait à propos d’un condamné politique qui est une des plus généreuses figures de notre temps : Sa grâce est accordée, il ne me reste plus qu’à l’obtenir.

He was obstinate against his Keeper of the Seals; he disputed step by step the ground of the guillotine with the attorneys general, those chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes the stacked files covered his table; he examined them all; it was an anguish for him to abandon these miserable condemned heads.

"Quelquefois ce moucheron — c’est ainsi qu’il se qualifie lui-même — sait lire ; quelquefois il sait écrire, toujours il sait barbouiller. Il n’hésite pas à se donner, par on ne sait quel mystérieux enseignement mutuel, tous les talents qui peuvent être utiles à la chose publiques ; de 1815 à 1830, il imitait le cri du dindon ; de 1830 à 1848, il griffonnait une poire sur les murailles. Un soir d’été, Louis-Philippe, rentrant à pied, en vit un, tout petit, haut comme cela, qui suait et se haussait pour charbonner une poire gigantesque sur un des piliers de la grille de Neuilly ; le roi, avec cette bonhomie qui lui venait de Henri IV, aida le gamin, acheva la poire, et donna un louis à l’enfant en lui disant : La poire est aussi là-dessus. Le gamin aime le hourvari. Un certain état violent lui plaît. Il exècre « les curés ». Un jour, rue de l’Université, un de ces jeunes drôles faisait un pied de nez à la porte cochère du numéro 69. ― Pourquoi fais-tu cela à cette porte ? lui demanda un passant. L’enfant répondit : Il y a là un curé. C’est là, en effet, que demeure le nonce du pape. Cependant, quel que soit le voltairianisme du gamin, si l’occasion se présente d’être enfant de chœur, il se peut qu’il accepte, et dans ce cas il sert la messe poliment. Il y a deux choses dont il est le Tantale et qu’il désire toujours sans y atteindre jamais : renverser le gouvernement et faire recoudre son pantalon.","Sometimes this midge — so he calls himself — knows how to read; sometimes he knows how to write, always he knows how to daub. He does not hesitate to give each other, by who knows what mysterious mutual teaching, all the talents that can be useful for public affairs; from 1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he scribbled a pear on the walls. One summer evening, Louis-Philippe, returning on foot, saw one, very small, tall like that, who was sweating and raising himself to char a gigantic pear on one of the pillars of the Neuilly gate; the king, with that good-naturedness which came to him from Henry IV, helped the urchin, finished off the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying to him: The pear is also on this. The kid likes hourvari. A certain violent state pleases him. He hates ""the priests"". One day, in the rue de l'Université, one of these funny young people thumbed his nose at the carriage entrance of number 69. ―Why are you doing that at this door? asked a passerby. The child answered: There is a priest there. It is there, in fact, that the papal nuncio lives. However, no matter how Voltairian the kid is, if the opportunity arises to be an altar boy, he may accept, and in that case he serves mass politely. There are two things he is the Tantalus of and always desires but never achieves: overthrowing the government and having his pants sewn up.","Sometimes this brat – this is how he refers to himself – can read, sometimes he can write. He can always draw. He is eager to acquire, by who knows what mysterious pooling of knowledge, every talent that might serve the common good. From 1815 to 1830 he imitated the turkey’s gobble. From 1830 to 1848 he scrawled pears on walls. One summer evening when Louis-Philippe was walking home, he saw one of them, a tiny little thing, just so high, sweating and straining to draw a gigantic pear on one of the pillars of the Neuilly gate with a piece of charcoal. With that good-heartedness inherited from Henri IV, the king helped the gamin to complete the pear and gave him a twenty-franc coin, saying, ‘There’s a pear on that too.’ The gamin loves uproar. He likes a certain state of violence. He loathes ‘pastors’. One day one of these young scamps was thumbing his nose at the carriage gate of number 69 Rue de l’Université. ‘Why do that at this entrance?’ asked a passer-by. The lad replied, ‘There’s a pastor living here.’ It was in fact the residence of the papal nuncio. However, whatever the gamin’s Voltairian attitudes, if the occasion to serve as a chorister presents itself he may well accept, and in that case he serves mass politely. There are two things that cast him as Tantalus, things he always yearns for without ever attaining: to overthrow the government and to get his trousers mended.","Sometimes this gnat—that is what he calls himself—knows how to read; sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub.

One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature which came to him from Henry IV. , helped the gamin, finished the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying: “The pear is on that also. ”19 The gamin loves uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him. He execrates “the curés.” One day, in the Rue de l’Université, one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No. 69. “Why are you doing that at the gate?” a passer-by asked. The boy replied: “There is a curé there.” It was there, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived. Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible that he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which he always desires without ever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get his trousers sewed up again.","Sometimes this gnat —it is thus that he styles himself— can read; sometimes he can write; he always knows how to scrawl.

One summer evening, Louis Philippe returning to the palace on foot, saw one of them, a little fellow, so high, sweating and stretching upon tiptoe, to make a charcoal sketch of a gigantic pear, on one of the pillars of the Neuilly gateway; the king, with that good nature which he inherited from Henry IV. , helped the boy, completed the pear, and gave the youngster a gold louis, saying: “ The pear’s on that too!” The gamin loves uproar.

"De son côté, Fauchelevent se creusait la cervelle. Il commençait par se déclarer qu’il n’y comprenait rien. Comment M. Madeleine se trouvait-il là, avec les murs qu’il y avait ? Des murs de cloître ne s’enjambent pas. Comment s’y trouvait-il avec un enfant ? On n’escalade pas une muraille à pic avec un enfant dans ses bras. Qu’était-ce que cet enfant ? D’où venaient-ils tous les deux ? Depuis que Fauchelevent était dans le couvent, il n’avait plus entendu parler de Montreuil-sur-Mer, et ne savait rien de ce qui s’était passé. Le père Madeleine avait cet air qui décourage les questions ; et d’ailleurs Fauchelevent se disait : On ne questionne pas un saint. M. Madeleine avait conservé pour lui tout son prestige. Seulement, de quelques mots échappés à Jean Valjean, le jardinier crut pouvoir conclure que M. Madeleine avait probablement fait faillite par la dureté des temps, et qu’il était poursuivi par ses créanciers ; ou bien qu’il était compromis dans une affaire politique et qu’il se cachait ; ce qui ne déplut point à Fauchelevent, lequel, comme beaucoup de nos paysans du nord, avait un vieux fond bonapartiste. Se cachant, M. Madeleine avait pris le couvent pour asile, et il était simple qu’il voulût y rester. Mais l’inexplicable, où Fauchelevent revenait toujours et où il se cassait la tête, c’était que M. Madeleine fût là, et qu’il y fût avec cette petite. Fauchelevent les voyait, les touchait, leur parlait, et n’y croyait pas. L’incompréhensible venait de faire son entrée dans la cahute de Fauchelevent. Fauchelevent était à tâtons dans les conjectures, et ne voyait plus rien de clair sinon ceci : M. Madeleine m’a sauvé la vie. Cette certitude unique suffisait, et le détermina. Il se dit à part lui : C’est mon tour. Il ajouta dans sa conscience : M. Madeleine n’a pas tant délibéré quand il s’est agi de se fourrer sous la voiture pour m’en tirer. Il décida qu’il sauverait M. Madeleine.","For his part, Fauchelevent racked his brains. He began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of it. How was Monsieur Madeleine there, with the walls there? Cloister walls do not span each other. How was he there with a child? You don't climb a sheer wall with a child in your arms. Who was this child? Where were they both from? Since Fauchelevent had been in the convent, he had heard no more of Montreuil-sur-Mer, and knew nothing of what had happened. Father Madeleine had that air which discourages questions; and moreover Fauchelevent said to himself: One does not question a saint. M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige for himself. Only, from a few words that escaped Jean Valjean, the gardener thought he could conclude that M. Madeleine had probably gone bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was being sued by his creditors; or that he was compromised in a political affair and was hiding; which did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our northern peasants, had an old Bonapartist background. Hiding himself, M. Madeleine had taken the convent for asylum, and it was obvious that he wished to remain there. But the inexplicable thing, to which Fauchelevent always returned and to which he racked his brains, was that M. Madeleine was there, and that he was there with this little girl. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and did not believe it. The incomprehensible had just entered Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent was groping in conjectures, and no longer saw anything clear except this: M. Madeleine saved my life. This single certainty was enough, and determined him. He said to himself: It's my turn. He added in his conscience: M. Madeleine did not deliberate so much when it came to getting under the car to get me out. He decided that he would save M. Madeleine.","As for Fauchelevent, he was racking his brains. He began by owning that he was completely baffled. How did Monsieur Madeleine come to be here, with walls like these? There is no stepping over cloister walls. How did he get here with a child? You do not scale a perpendicular wall with a child in your arms. Who was this child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had been at the convent, he had heard nothing of Montreuil-sur-Mer and knew nothing of what had happened. Père Madeleine had that air about him that discourages questions. And besides, Fauchelevent said to himself, you don’t question a saint. Monsieur Madeleine, for him, retained all his prestige. Only, from a few words Jean Valjean had let slip, the gardener thought he was able to infer that Monsieur Madeleine had probably been bankrupted in these hard times, and was being pursued by his creditors. Or else he was implicated in some political affair and was in hiding. Fauchelevent, who like many of our peasants in the north was an old Bonapartist at heart, was not at all unhappy about that. In hiding, Monsieur Madeleine had identified the convent as a refuge and it was quite natural he should wish to stay here. But the inexplicable thing, which Fauchelevent kept coming back to and could not work out, was how Monsieur Madeleine got here and how he got in with that little girl. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and did not believe it. The incomprehensible had just found its way into Fauchelevent’s cabin. Fauchelevent was lost in conjecture and could see nothing clearly but this: Monsieur Madeleine saved my life. This sole certainty was sufficient, and decided his course. He said to himself: ‘It’s my turn now.’ He added in his conscience: ‘Monsieur Madeleine didn’t spend so much time deliberating when it was a matter of getting under the cart so that I could be pulled out from under it.’ He made up his mind to save Monsieur Madeleine.","On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one’s arms. Who was that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: “One does not question a saint.” M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent’s eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised himself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent’s hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: “M. Madeleine saved my life.” This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said to himself: “It is my turn now.” He added in his conscience: “M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.” He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.","For his part, Fauchelevent was racking his brains. He began by deciding that he was utterly bewildered. How did Monsieur Madeleine come there, with such walls! The walls of a cloister are not so easily crossed. How did he happen to be with a child? A man does not scale a steep wall with a child in his arms. Who was this child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had been in the convent, he had not heard a word from M—— sur M——, and he knew nothing of what had taken place. Father Madeleine wore that air which discourages questions; and moreover, Fauchelevent said to himself: “One does not question a saint.” To him Monsieur Madeleine had preserved all his prestige. From some words that escaped from Jean Valjean, however, the gardener thought he might conclude that Monsieur Madeleine had probably failed on account of the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors; or it might be that he was compromised in some political affair and was concealing himself; which did not at all displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the north, had an old Bonapartist heart. Being in concealment, Monsieur Madeleine had taken the convent for an asylum, and it was natural that he should wish to remain there. But the mystery to which Fauchelevent constantly returned and over which he was racking his brains was, that Monsieur Madeleine should be there, and that this little girl should be with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and yet did not believe it. An incomprehensibility had made its way into Fauchelevent’s hut. Fauchelevent was groping amid conjectures, but saw nothing clearly except this: Monsieur Madeleine has saved my life. This single certainty was sufficient, and determined him. He said aside to himself: It is my turn now. He added in his conscience: Monsieur Madeleine did not deliberate so long when the question was about squeezing himself under the waggon to draw me out. He decided that he would save Monsieur Madeleine."
"― Voici le médecin des morts qui s’en va, dit Fauchelevent. Il a regardé, et dit : elle est morte, c’est bon. Quand le médecin a visé le passe-port pour le paradis, les pompes funèbres envoient une bière. Si c’est une mère, les mères l’ensevelissent ; si c’est une sœur, les sœurs l’ensevelissent. Après quoi, je cloue. Cela fait partie de mon jardinage. Un jardinier est un peu fossoyeur. On la met dans une salle basse de l’église qui communique à la rue et où pas un homme ne peut entrer que le médecin des morts. Je ne compte pas pour des hommes les croque-morts et moi. C’est dans cette salle que je cloue la bière. Les croque-morts viennent la prendre, et fouette cocher ! c’est comme cela qu’on s’en va au ciel. On apporte une boîte où il n’y a rien, on la remporte avec quelque chose dedans. Voilà ce que c’est qu’un enterrement. De profundis.","""Here is the doctor of the dead going away,"" said Fauchelevent. He looked, and said: she is dead, it is good. When the doctor has aimed for the passport to paradise, the undertakers send a beer. If it's a mother, mothers bury it; if it is a sister, the sisters bury her. After which, I nail. It's part of my gardening. A gardener is a bit of a gravedigger. She is put in a lower room of the church which communicates with the street and where no man can enter except the doctor of the dead. I don't count the undertakers and myself as men. It is in this room that I nail the beer. The undertakers come to take her, and whip the coachman! this is how you go to heaven. We bring a box where there is nothing, we take it away with something in it. This is what a funeral is. De Profundis.","‘That’s the doctor for the dead leaving,’ said Fauchelevent. ‘ He’s taken a look and said, “She’s dead, sure enough.” When the doctor has certified the passport for paradise, the undertakers send a coffin. If it’s a mother, the mothers lay her out. If it’s a sister, the sisters lay her out. After that, I do the nailing. That’s part of my gardening duties. A gardener’s a bit of a gravedigger. She’s placed in a side room in the church that connects with the street and that no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don’t count the coffin bearers and myself as men. It’s in that chamber that I nail down the coffin. The coffin bearers come to fetch it, and drive on, coachman! That’s how you go to heaven. They bring a box that has nothing inside it, they carry it off with something inside it. That’s what a burial is. De profundis. *’","“That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,” said Fauchelevent. “He has taken a look and said: ‘She is dead, that is well.’ When the doctor has signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker’s company sends a coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister, the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part of my gardener’s duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don’t count the undertaker’s men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I nail up the coffin. The undertaker’s men come and get it, and whip up, coachman! that’s the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That’s what a burial is like. De profundis.”","“That is the death-physician going away,” said Fauchelevent. “He has looked, and said she is dead; it is right. When the inspector has viséd the passport for paradise, the undertaker sends a coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if it is a sister, the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail it up. That’s a part of my gardening. A gardener is something of a gravedigger. They put her in a low room in the church which communicates with the street, and where no man can enter except the death-physician. I do not count the bearers and myself for men. In that room I nail the coffin. The bearers come and take her, and whip-up, driver: that is the way they go to heaven. They bring in a box with nothing in it, they carry it away with something inside. That is what an interment is. De profundis.”"

"La Flore de Cauteretz ne se vendait absolument plus. Les expériences sur l’indigo n’avaient point réussi dans le petit jardin d’Austerlitz qui était mal exposé. M. Mabeuf n’y pouvait cultiver que quelques plantes rares qui aiment l’humidité et l’ombre. Il ne se décourageait pourtant pas. Il avait obtenu un coin de terre au Jardin des plantes, en bonne exposition, pour y faire, « à ses frais », ses essais d’indigo. Pour cela il avait mis les cuivres de sa Flore au mont-de-piété. Il avait réduit son déjeuner à deux œufs, et il en laissait un à sa vieille servante dont il ne payait plus les gages depuis quinze mois. Et souvent son déjeuner était son seul repas. Il ne riait plus de son rire enfantin, il était devenu morose, et ne recevait plus de visites. Marius faisait bien de ne plus songer à venir. Quelquefois, à l’heure où M. Mabeuf allait au Jardin des plantes, le vieillard et le jeune homme se croisaient sur le boulevard de l’Hôpital. Ils ne parlaient pas et se faisaient un signe de tête tristement. Chose poignante qu’il y ait un moment où la misère dénoue ! On était deux amis, on est deux passants.","La Flore de Cauteretz was absolutely no longer sold. The experiments on indigo had not succeeded in the little garden of Austerlitz which was badly exposed. Mr. Mabeuf could only grow a few rare plants there that like humidity and shade. However, he was not discouraged. He had obtained a corner of land in the Jardin des Plantes, in good exposure, to carry out, ""at his own expense"", his indigo tests. For this he had placed the coppers of his Flora on the pawnshop. He had reduced his breakfast to two eggs, and left one for his old servant, whose wages he had not paid for fifteen months. And often his lunch was his only meal. He no longer laughed his childish laugh, he had become morose, and no longer received visitors. Marius did well not to dream of coming. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf went to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man passed each other on the Boulevard de l'Hôpital. They didn't speak and nodded sadly to each other. How poignant that there is a moment when misery unravels! We were two friends, we are two passers-by.","The Flora of Cauterets was simply not selling any more. The experiments with indigo had been unsuccessful in the little garden at Austerlitz, which got no sun. Monsieur Mabeuf could cultivate in it only those few rare plants that like damp and shade.

For this purpose he had pawned the copper-plates of his Flora. He had reduced his lunch to two eggs, and one of these he would leave for his old servant whose wages he had not paid for the last fifteen months. And often, lunch was his only meal of the day. He no longer laughed with his childlike laugh, he had grown morose and he did not receive visitors any more. It was just as well that Marius no longer thought of calling on him. Sometimes, when Monsieur Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man would pass each other on Boulevard de l’Hôpital. They did not speak, and nodded sadly to each other. Heart-breaking that a time should come when poverty creates estrangement!

"Nous venons de le qualifier pauvre paysan picard. La qualification est juste, mais incomplète. Au point de cette histoire où nous sommes, un peu de physiologie du père Fauchelevent devient utile. Il était paysan, mais il avait été tabellion, ce qui ajoutait de la chicane à sa finesse, et de la pénétration à sa naïveté. Ayant, pour des causes diverses, échoué dans ses affaires, de tabellion il était tombé charretier et manœuvre. Mais, en dépit des jurons et des coups de fouet, nécessaires aux chevaux, à ce qu’il paraît, il était resté du tabellion en lui. Il avait quelque esprit naturel ; il ne disait ni j’ons ni j’avons ; il causait, chose rare au village ; et les autres paysans disaient de lui : Il parle quasiment comme un monsieur à chapeau. Fauchelevent était en effet de cette espèce que le vocabulaire impertinent et léger du dernier siècle qualifiait : demi-bourgeois, demi-manant ; et que les métaphores tombant du château sur la chaumière étiquetaient dans le casier de la roture : un peu rustre, un peu citadin ; poivre et sel. Fauchelevent, quoique fort éprouvé et fort usé par le sort, espèce de pauvre vieille âme montrant la corde, était pourtant homme de premier mouvement, et très spontané ; qualité précieuse qui empêche qu’on soit jamais mauvais. Ses défauts et ses vices, car il en avait eu, étaient de surface ; en somme, sa physionomie était de celles qui réussissent près de l’observateur. Ce vieux visage n’avait aucune de ces fâcheuses rides du haut du front qui signifient méchanceté ou bêtise.","We have just described him as a poor Picard peasant. The qualification is correct, but incomplete. At the point in this story where we are, a little physiology of Father Fauchelevent becomes useful. He was a peasant, but he had been a tabellion, which added chicanery to his shrewdness, and penetration to his naivety. Having, for various reasons, failed in his business, he fell from tabellion to carter and labourer. But despite the oaths and whippings, which horses need, it seems, there was tabellion in him. He had some natural mind; he said neither j'ons nor j'avoir; he was chatting, a rare thing in the village; and the other peasants said of him: He speaks almost like a gentleman in a hat. Fauchelevent was indeed of that species which the impertinent and frivolous vocabulary of the last century qualified: demi-bourgeois, demi-manant; and whom the metaphors falling from the chateau to the cottage labeled in the locker room of the commoners: a little boorish, a little city dweller; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, although greatly tried and worn out by fate, a kind of poor old soul showing the rope, was nevertheless a man of first movement, and very spontaneous; precious quality that prevents one from ever being bad. His faults and his vices, for he had had some, were superficial; in short, his countenance was one of those which succeed near the observer. This old face had none of those annoying wrinkles on the top of the forehead which signify meanness or stupidity.","We have just called him ‘a poor Picardy peasant’. That description is accurate but incomplete. At this point in our story something of Père Fauchelevent’s social background becomes useful. He was a peasant but he had been a copy clerk, which added casuistry to his cunning and insight to his naivety. Having for various reasons failed in his business, from being a copy clerk he had sunk to being a carter and a labourer. But despite oaths and lashings, essential to horses, apparently, something of the copy clerk survived in him. He had some natural wit. He did not say ‘I’s’ or ‘I ’as’, he was chatty, a rarity in village life, and the other peasants said of him, ‘He talks almost like a gentleman that wears a hat.’ Fauchelevent was in fact one of that species which the supercilious and flippant vocabulary of the last century described as ‘half burgher, half peasant’ *, and in metaphors that rained down from the château on to the thatched cottage was labelled in the commoner category as ‘urban-rustic; pepper and salt’. Though sorely tried and much worn down by fate, a poor threadbare old soul, as it were, Fauchelevent was still a man of impulse and very spontaneous, a precious quality that prevents a person from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he did have some, were superficial. In short, he had the type of physiognomy that finds favour with the observer. That aged face had none of those disagreeable vertical lines on his forehead that denote malice or stupidity.","We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description is just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent’s physiology becomes useful. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his cunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses seem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had some natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: “He talks almost like a gentleman with a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors showered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather citified; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice or stupidity.","We have just described him as a poor Picardy peasant. The description is true, but incomplete. At the point of this story at which we now are, a closer acquaintance with Fauchelevent becomes necessary. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added craft to his cunning, and penetration to his simplicity. Having, from various causes, failed in his business, from a notary he had fallen to a cartman and labourer. But, in spite of the oaths and blows which seem necessary with horses, he had retained something of the notary. He had some natural wit; he said neither I is nor I has; he could carry on a conversation, a rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: he talks almost like a gentleman. Fauchelevent belonged in fact to that class which the flippant and impertinent vocabulary of the last century termed half-yeoman, half-clown; and which the metaphors falling from the castle to the hovel, label in the distribution of the commonalty: half-rustic, half-citizen, pepper-and-salt. Fauchelevent, although sorely tried and sorely used by Fortune; a sort of poor old soul worn threadbare, was nevertheless an impulsive man, and had a very willing heart; a precious quality, which prevents one from ever being wicked. His faults and his vices, for such he had, were superficial; and finally, his physiognomy was one of those which attract the observer.

"Rien dans l’histoire n’a ressemblé à ce quart d’heure qui commence à 1814 et qui se termine vers 1820 à l’avénement de M. de Villèle, l’homme pratique de la droite. Ces six années furent un moment extraordinaire ; à la fois brillant et morne, riant et sombre, éclairé comme par le rayonnement de l’aube et tout couvert en même temps des ténèbres des grandes catastrophes qui emplissaient encore l’horizon et s’enfonçaient lentement dans le passé. Il y eut là, dans cette lumière et dans cette ombre, tout un petit monde nouveau et vieux, bouffon et triste, juvénile et sénile, se frottant les yeux ; rien ne ressemble au réveil comme le retour ; groupe qui regardait la France avec humeur et que la France regardait avec ironie ; de bons vieux hiboux marquis plein les rues, les revenus et les revenants, des « ci-devant » stupéfaits de tout, de braves et nobles gentilshommes souriant d’être en France et en pleurant aussi, ravis de revoir leur patrie, désespérés de ne plus retrouver leur monarchie ; la noblesse des croisades conspuant la noblesse de l’empire, c’est-à-dire la noblesse de l’épée ; les races historiques ayant perdu le sens de l’histoire ; les fils des compagnons de Charlemagne dédaignant les compagnons de Napoléon. Les épées, comme nous venons de le dire, se renvoyaient l’insulte ; l’épée de Fontenoy était risible et n’était qu’une rouillarde ; l’épée de Marengo était odieuse et n’était qu’un sabre. Jadis méconnaissait Hier. On n’avait plus le sentiment de ce qui était grand, ni le sentiment de ce qui était ridicule. Il y eut quelqu’un qui appela Bonaparte Scapin. Ce monde n’est plus. Rien, répétons-le, n’en reste aujourd’hui. Quand nous en tirons par hasard quelque figure et que nous essayons de le faire revivre par la pensée, il nous semble étrange comme un monde antédiluvien. C’est qu’en effet il a été lui aussi englouti par un déluge. Il a disparu sous deux révolutions. Quels flots que les idées !

There was there, in this light and in this shadow, a whole little world new and old, buffoonish and sad, juvenile and senile, rubbing their eyes; nothing is like waking up like coming back; a group that looked at France with humor and that France looked at with irony; good old marquis owls full of the streets, incomes and ghosts, ""ci-devants"" amazed at everything, brave and noble gentlemen smiling to be in France and crying too, delighted to see their homeland again, desperate not to no longer regain their monarchy; the nobility of the crusades shouting down the nobility of the empire, that is, the nobility of the sword; historic races that have lost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon.

There was in that light and that shadow a whole little world, old and new, comic and sad, youthful and aged, rubbing its eyes. A return is like nothing so much as a reawakening. This was a group that regarded France with resentment and that France regarded with scorn. The streets were full of good old marquises who had come out of hiding, returnees and revenants, the old aristocracy, amazed at everything; decent, noble gentlemen smiling because they were back in France, and weeping too, thrilled to see their country again, heartbroken not to find their monarchy in place; the nobility of the crusades decrying the nobility of the Empire, in other words the nobility of the sword; historic dynasties who had lost the sense of history, the sons of Charlemagne’s comrades-in-arms despising Napoleon’s comrades-in-arms. As we have just said, swords traded insults: the sword of Fontenoy was ludicrous and just an old museum piece; the sword of Marengo was loathsome and just a butcher’s knife. Yesteryear belittled yesterday. There was no longer any appreciation of what was great, no sense of what was ridiculous. There was someone who called Bonaparte ‘Scapin’. This world no longer exists. Let us say again, nothing of it survives. If we pick one of those figures at random and try mentally to bring him to life again he seems as strange to us as some antediluvian world.

"Une certaine après-midi, qui avait, comme on va le voir, quelque coïncidence avec les événements racontés plus haut, Laigle de Meaux était sensuellement adossé au chambranle de la porte du café Musain.

"Une autre fois, il avait fait une rencontre qui lui avait produit un effet singulier. Il avait croisé dans les petites rues qui avoisinent le boulevard des Invalides un homme vêtu comme un ouvrier et coiffé d’une casquette à longue visière qui laissait passer des mèches de cheveux très blancs. Marius fut frappé de la beauté de ces cheveux blancs et considéra cet homme qui marchait à pas lents et comme absorbé dans une méditation douloureuse. Chose étrange, il lui parut reconnaître M. Leblanc. C’étaient les mêmes cheveux, le même profil, autant que la casquette le laissait voir, la même allure, seulement plus triste. Mais pourquoi ces habits d’ouvrier ? qu’est-ce que cela voulait dire ? que signifiait ce déguisement ? Marius fut très étonné. Quand il revint à lui, son premier mouvement fut de se mettre à suivre cet homme ; qui sait s’il ne tenait point enfin la trace qu’il cherchait ? En tout cas, il fallait revoir l’homme de près et éclaircir l’énigme. Mais il s’avisa de cette idée trop tard, l’homme n’était déjà plus là. Il avait pris quelque petite rue latérale, et Marius ne put le retrouver. Cette rencontre le préoccupa quelques jours, puis s’effaça. ― Après tout, se dit-il, ce n’est probablement qu’une ressemblance.","Another time, he had made an encounter which had had a singular effect on him. He had met in the little streets which adjoin the Boulevard des Invalides a man dressed like a workman and wearing a cap with a long visor which let through strands of very white hair. Marius was struck by the beauty of this white hair and gazed at this man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation. Strangely enough, he seemed to recognize M. Leblanc. It was the same hair, the same profile, as much as the cap showed, the same look, only sadder. But why these workman's clothes? what did that mean? what did this disguise mean? Marius was very surprised. When he came to, his first movement was to start following this man; who knows if he hadn't finally got the trace he was looking for? In any case, it was necessary to see the man closely and clear up the enigma. But he thought of this idea too late, the man was already gone. He had taken a little side street, and Marius could not find him. This meeting preoccupied him for a few days, then faded away. 'After all,' he thought, 'it's probably only a resemblance.","Another time, he had a chance encounter that made a curious impression on him. In the little streets around Boulevard des Invalides he passed a man dressed as a worker, in a long-peaked cap with locks of very white hair showing beneath it. Marius was struck by the magnificence of this white hair, and studied the man, who was walking slowly and as though lost in painful reflection. Strange to say, he thought he recognized Monsieur Leblanc. It was the same hair, the same profile in so as far as it could be seen under the cap, the same bearing, only sadder. But why these working man’s clothes? What did this mean? What did this disguise signify? Marius was very surprised. When he recovered, his first impulse was to follow the man. Who was to know whether he might not at last have picked up the trail he had been seeking? In any case he must get a closer look at the man and clear up the mystery. But he thought of this too late, the man was not there any more. He had already turned into some little side street and Marius was unable to find him. This encounter preoccupied him for several days, then faded from his mind. ‘After all,’ he said to himself, ‘it was probably just someone who looked like him.’","On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cap permitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But why these workingman’s clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signified that disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself, his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the man near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longer there.

"Une lutte herculéenne s’était engagée. D’un coup de poing en plein torse M.

I want to be a bit of a millionnaire!”","“Thunder! it is a good long time now that I have been a parishioner of the die-of-hunger-if-you-have-any-fire-and-die-of-cold-if-you-have-any-bread parish! I have had misery enough! my yoke and the yoke of other people! I jest no longer, I find it comic no longer, enough of puns, good God! No more farces, Father Eternal! I want food for my hunger, I want drink for my thirst! to stuff!, to sleep! to do nothing! I want to have my turn, I do! before I burst! I want to be a bit of a millionaire!”"
"Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,","Take back your scepter and your chariot,","I’d have told great Caesar his prizes to keep,","Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,","Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,"
