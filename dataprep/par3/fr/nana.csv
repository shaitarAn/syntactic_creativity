"Et elle le quitta. Il était debout au milieu du salon. Les derniers mots sonnaient comme un tocsin 27 à ses oreilles : c’est fini, bien fini ; et il croyait que la terre s’ouvrait sous ses pieds. Dans le vide de son cerveau, l’homme qui attendait Nana avait disparu ; seul, Philippe demeurait, aux bras nus de la jeune femme, continuellement. Elle ne niait pas, elle l’aimait, puisqu’elle voulait lui éviter le chagrin d’une infidélité. C’était fini, bien fini. Il respira fortement, il regarda autour de la pièce, étouffé par un poids qui l’écrasait. Des souvenirs lui revenaient un à un, les nuits rieuses de la Mignotte, des heures de caresse où il se croyait son enfant, puis des voluptés volées dans cette pièce même. Et jamais, jamais plus ! Il était trop petit, il n’avait pas grandi assez vite ; Philippe le remplaçait, parce qu’il avait de la barbe. Alors, c’était la fin, il ne pouvait plus vivre. Son vice s’était trempé d’une tendresse infinie, d’une adoration sensuelle, où tout son être se donnait. Puis, comment oublier, lorsque son frère resterait là ? son frère, un peu de son sang28, un autre moi dont le plaisir l’enrageait de jalousie. C'était la fin, il voulait mourir.","And she left him. He was standing in the middle of the living room. The last words sounded like a tocsin 27 in his ears: it's over, well over; and he believed that the earth was opening under his feet. In the void of his brain, the man waiting for Nana had disappeared; only Philippe remained, in the bare arms of the young woman, continually. She did not deny, she loved him, since she wanted to spare him the grief of infidelity. It was over, well over. He breathed heavily, he looked around the room, suffocated by a weight that crushed him. Memories came back to him one by one, the laughing nights at La Mignotte, the hours of caress when he thought he was his child, then the pleasures stolen from this very room. And never, never again! He was too small, he hadn't grown fast enough; Philippe replaced him because he had a beard. So that was the end, he couldn't live anymore. Her vice had been steeped in an infinite tenderness, a sensual adoration, in which her whole being was given. Then, how to forget, when his brother would remain there? his brother, a bit of his blood,28 another self whose pleasure enraged him with jealousy. It was the end, he wanted to die.","And she left him. He was standing in the centre of the parlour. The last words sounded like a knell in his ears, “It is over, all over”; and the ground seemed to open beneath his feet. In the vacuum of his brain, the man who was awaiting Nana had disappeared; Philippe alone remained, continually in the woman’s bare arms. She did not deny it; she certainly loved him, as she wished to spare him the grief of knowing her to be unfaithful. It was over, all over. He drew a long breath, he gazed around the room, choked by a weight that was crushing him. Recollections returned to him one by one—the merry nights at La Mignotte, hours of love during which he thought himself her child, the voluptuous pleasures snatched in that very room. And never, never more! He was too little , he had not grown quick enough; Philippe had taken his place, because he had a beard. So, it was the end, he could no longer live. His vice had become full of an infinite tenderness, of a sensual adoration, in which his whole being was centred. Then, how could he forget, when his brother would remain there—his brother, who was of the same blood, another self whose pleasure drove him mad with jealousy? It was the end, he wished to die.","And she left him, and he stood in the middle of the drawing room. Her last words rang like the knell of a tocsin in his ears: ""It's over, quite over!"" And he thought the ground was opening beneath his feet. There was a void in his brain from which the man awaiting Nana had disappeared. Philippe alone remained there in the young woman's bare embrace forever and ever. She did not deny it: she loved him, since she wanted to spare him the pain of her infidelity. It was over, quite over. He breathed heavily and gazed round the room, suffocating beneath a crushing weight. Memories kept recurring to him one after the other--memories of merry nights at La Mignotte, of amorous hours during which he had fancied himself her child, of pleasures stolen in this very room. And now these things would never, never recur! He was too small; he had not grown up quickly enough; Philippe was supplanting him because he was a bearded man. So then this was the end; he could not go on living. His vicious passion had become transformed into an infinite tenderness, a sensual adoration, in which his whole being was merged. Then, too, how was he to forget it all if his brother remained--his brother, blood of his blood, a second self, whose enjoyment drove him mad with jealousy? It was the end of all things; he wanted to die.","She left him standing in the middle of the drawing-room. Her last words were ringing in his ears like a death-knell: this is the end, it’s all over and done with; he could feel the earth opening up under his feet. In his state of shock, he’d forgotten the man waiting for Nana at Tricon’s, he could only see Philippe, Philippe perpetually clasped in Nana’s naked arms. She didn’t deny it, she loved him, for she wanted to protect him from being unhappy because she was going to bed with someone else. No, this was really the end, everything was really over and done with … He took a deep breath and looked round the room; there was a crushing weight on his chest. Memories were flooding back to him one by one: the wonderful nights at La Mignotte; the hours spent being caressed and fondled when he could think of himself as her son; the stolen pleasures he’d enjoyed in this very room … And now it was all over, he’d never have such wonderful times again. He was too young, he hadn’t grown up quickly enough: Philippe had ousted him because he was able to grow a beard. No, this was the end, he couldn’t go on living. His lust had become refined into something infinitely tender, a sensual adoration which had taken complete possession of him. And how could he ever forget, when his brother would always be there? His brother, his double, with the same blood in his veins, whose pleasure was driving him mad with jealousy. No, this was the end, he didn’t want to go on living …"

"Mais ce qui acheva de fondre le cœur de la jeune femme, ce fut l’arrivée de Louiset. Sa crise de maternité eut la violence d’un coup de folie. Elle emportait son fils au soleil pour le regarder gigoter ; elle se roulait avec lui sur l’herbe, après l’avoir habillé comme un jeune prince. Tout de suite elle voulut qu’il dormît près d’elle, dans la chambre voisine, où madame Lerat, très impressionnée par la campagne, ronflait, dès qu’elle était sur le dos. Et Louiset ne faisait pas le moindre tort à Zizi, au contraire. Elle disait qu’elle avait deux enfants, elle les confondait dans le même caprice de tendresse. La nuit, à plus de dix reprises, elle lâchait Zizi pour voir si Louiset avait une bonne respiration ; mais, quand elle revenait, elle reprenait son Zizi avec un restant de ses caresses maternelles, elle faisait la maman ; tandis que lui, vicieux, aimant bien être petit aux bras de cette grande fille, se laissait bercer comme un bébé qu’on endort. C'était si bon, que, charmée de cette existence, elle lui proposa de ne plus jamais quitter la compagne. Ils renverraient tout le monde, ils vivraient seuls, lui, elle et l’enfant. Et ils firent mille projets, jusqu’à l’aube, sans entendre madame Lerat, qui ronflait à poings fermés, lasse d’avoir cueilli des fleurs champêtres.","But what completely melted the heart of the young woman was the arrival of Louiset. Her maternity crisis had the violence of a stroke of madness. She would take her son out into the sun to watch him wriggle; she rolled with him on the grass, after having dressed him like a young prince. At once she wanted him to sleep near her, in the adjoining room, where Madame Lerat, very impressed by the countryside, snored as soon as she was on her back. And Louiset was not doing Zizi the slightest harm, on the contrary. She said she had two children, she confused them in the same caprice of tenderness. At night, more than ten times, she let go of Zizi to see if Louiset was breathing properly; but, when she came back, she took her Zizi back with a remnant of her maternal caresses, she played the mother; while he, vicious, loving to be small in the arms of this big girl, let himself be rocked like a baby that one puts to sleep. It was so good that, charmed by this existence, she suggested never to leave the companion again. They would send everyone away, they would live alone, him, her and the child. And they made a thousand plans, until dawn, without hearing Madame Lerat, who was snoring with closed fists, tired of having picked the flowers of the country.","But what caused the young woman’s heart completely to melt was the arrival of little Louis. Her attack of maternal love bordered on madness. She carried her son into the sunshine to see him sprawl about; she rolled with him over the grass, after dressing him like a prince. She at once insisted that he should sleep near her, in the next room, where Madame Lerat, very much smitten with the country, commenced to snore as soon as she was lying on her back. And little Louis did not in the least interfere with her love for Zizi; on the contrary. She said that she had two children; she confounded them in the same caprice of affection. During the night, on more than ten occasions, she quitted Zizi to go and see if little Louis was breathing all right; but when she returned she cuddled her Zizi with the remains of her maternal caresses. She acted the mamma towards him; whilst he, vicious youngster! liking very much to be little in the arms of that big girl, let her nurse him like a baby being rocked to sleep. It was so nice that, charmed with this existence, she seriously proposed to him that they should never again leave the country. They would send every one away, and live alone together—he, she, and the baby. And they built a thousand castles in the air until daybreak, without hearing Madame Lerat, who, tired out with gathering wild flowers, snored loud enough to waken the whole household.","But what utterly melted the young woman's heart was Louiset's arrival. She had an access of maternal affection which was as violent as a mad fit. She would carry off her boy into the sunshine outside to watch him kicking about; she would dress him like a little prince and roll with him in the grass. The moment he arrived she decided that he was to sleep near her, in the room next hers, where Mme Lerat, whom the country greatly affected, used to begin snoring the moment her head touched the pillow. Louiset did not hurt Zizi's position in the least. On the contrary, Nana said that she had now two children, and she treated them with the same wayward tenderness. At night, more than ten times running, she would leave Zizi to go and see if Louiset were breathing properly, but on her return she would re-embrace her Zizi and lavish on him the caresses that had been destined for the child. She played at being Mamma while he wickedly enjoyed being dandled in the arms of the great wench and allowed himself to be rocked to and fro like a baby that is being sent to sleep. It was all so delightful, and Nana was so charmed with her present existence, that she seriously proposed to him never to leave the country. They would send all the other people away, and he, she and the child would live alone. And with that they would make a thousand plans till daybreak and never once hear Mme Lerat as she snored vigorously after the fatigues of a day spent in picking country flowers.","But it was the arrival of her little Louis which finally turned her heart into jelly. Her maternal love became hysterical. She would carry her son out on to the lawn to watch him wriggling about in the sun and roll about with him in the grass, after first dressing him up like a little prince. She insisted at once that he must sleep nearby, in the adjoining bedroom, where Madame Lerat, much impressed by life in the country, used to start snoring as soon as she was on her back. But Zizi didn’t suffer as a result, quite the opposite, for she said she now had two children to look after and her spontaneous affection included both of them, indiscriminately. A dozen times a night she’d leave Zizi to go and see if Louiset was breathing properly, and when she came back she’d smother her Zizi with all the motherly hugs and kisses she had to spare; she was his mummy too and the boy shamelessly delighted in being cuddled by this big young woman, like a baby being lulled to sleep. It was so charming an existence that she seriously suggested to him never going back to town; they’d send everybody packing and live all by themselves, he and she and her son. And they would work out hundreds of plans until day broke, never hearing Madame Lerat snoring away, sound asleep, tired out from picking wild flowers."
"Des idées noires les envahissaient, dans la sévérité de cette chambre. Elles avaient peur, c’était bête de causer là si longtemps ; mais un besoin de voir les clouait sur le tapis.

Sous le lit, une assiette creuse pleine de phénol 13 dégageait une odeur fade.

They felt frightened. It was silly to stand talking so long, but a longing to see her kept them rooted to the spot.

Under the bed a deep plate full of phenol exhaled an insipid smell. And every few moments tiny gusts of wind swelled the window curtains. The window opened on the boulevard, whence rose a dull roaring sound.","In this austerely furnished bedroom, a feeling of gloom was descending on the ladies. They began to be frightened, it was stupid to stay here chatting for so long, but they felt riveted to the spot by the urge to look. The room was in shadow, stiflingly hot and muggy; the lamp was casting a moon-shaped patch of light on the ceiling. There was a sickly smell coming from a soup plate of carbolic acid under the bed. Little gusts of air kept making the curtains billow out at the window opening out on to the boulevard, where a dull roar could be heard."

Et Nana, qui venait de monter sur le siège de son cocher, comme soulevée, restait toute blanche, prise d’un tremblement, si empoignée, qu’elle se taisait. Près d’elle, Labordette avait retrouvé son sourire.","For a few seconds, that was everyone's opinion. But, slowly, the filly was still winning, in a continuous effort. Then, an immense emotion broke out. The tail of the horses, behind, no longer interested. A supreme struggle began between Spirit, Nana, Lusignan and Valerio II. We named them, we noted their progress or their failure, in sentences without sequence, stammered. And Nana, who had just climbed into her coachman's seat, as if lifted, remained completely white, seized with a trembling, so gripped that she was silent. Beside her, Labordette had regained her smile.","For some seconds that was the general opinion. But the filly slowly continued to gain ground in a continued effort. Then an immense emotion seized upon all. The horses in the rear no longer excited the smallest interest. A last struggle began between Spirit, Nana, Lusignan, and Valerio II. Their names were on the lips of everyone, their progress or their falling off was proclaimed in short disconnected sentences. And Nana, who had climbed on to the coachman’s seat, as though lifted up by some invisible power, was all pale and trembling, and so deeply moved that she could not say a word. Labordette, close beside her, was once more smiling.","For some seconds this was everybody's opinion. But little by little the filly kept gaining and gaining, spurting hard all the while. Thereupon a vast wave of feeling passed over the crowd, and the tail of horses in the rear ceased to interest. A supreme struggle was beginning between Spirit, Nana, Lusignan and Valerio II. They were pointed out; people estimated what ground they had gained or lost in disconnected, gasping phrases. And Nana, who had mounted up on the coach box, as though some power had lifted her thither, stood white and trembling and so deeply moved as not to be able to speak. At her side Labordette smiled as of old.","hands! . . .’ For a few seconds everybody thought the same, but galloping hard, the filly was slowly gaining ground. The excitement was intense. Nobody was interested in the tailenders anymore. The final tussle between Spirit, Nana, Lusignan, and Valerio II began. People were stammering incoherently, calling out their names and watching how they progressed or fell back. Nana had climbed up on to her coachman’s box, as though lifted up by her excitement, and was standing there pale-faced and suddenly trembling, too nervous to speak. Beside her Labordette was now looking cheerful again."

"« Vous savez qu’il pose depuis ce matin, raconta Mignon. Je l’ai vu à six heures, il n’a pas bougé... Dès les premiers mots de Labordette, il est venu là, avec son mouchoir sur la figure... Toutes les demi-heures, il se traîne jusqu’ici pour demander si la personne d’en haut va mieux, et il retourne s’asseoir... Dame ! ce n’est pas sain, cette chambre ; on a beau aimer les gens, on n’a pas envie de crever. »","""You know he's been posing since this morning,"" said Mignon.

Lady! it's not healthy, this room; no matter how much we love people, we don't want to die. »","“You know he’s been there ever since this morning,” related Mignon. “I saw him at six o’clock, he has scarcely moved since. At the first words Labordette uttered, he came and posted himself there, with his handkerchief over his face. Every half hour he crawls as far as here, to inquire if the person upstairs is better, and then returns to his seat. Well! you know, it’s not healthy , that room. One may love people without wishing to croak.”","""You know, he's been waiting there since this morning,"" Mignon informed them. ""I saw him at six o'clock, and he hasn't moved since. Directly Labordette spoke about it he came there with his handkerchief up to his face. Every half-hour he comes dragging himself to where we're standing to ask if the person upstairs is doing better, and then he goes back and sits down. Hang it, that room isn't healthy! It's all very well being fond of people, but one doesn't want to kick the bucket.""","‘You know, he’s been squatting there ever since this morning’, said Mignon. ‘I saw him at six and he’s not gone away … As soon as he heard the news from Labordette, he came here with a handkerchief over his face … Every half-hour, he drags himself along over here to ask if the person upstairs is any better and then goes back and sits down … After all, it’s not very healthy in that bedroom … However much you love someone , you’re still not keen to kick the bucket.’"
"Il se calma. Mais le vide de la salle, le demi-jour du lustre, ce recueillement d’église plein de voix chuchotantes et de battements de porte l’agaçaient.","He calmed down. But the emptiness of the room, the half-light of the chandelier, this church meditation full of whispering voices and knocking of doors irritated him.","After this explosion he calmed down a little.

"De nouveau, une paix lourde régnait dans le foyer des artistes, comme à cent lieues de cette salle, où toute une foule applaudissait. Simonne et Clarisse en étaient toujours sur Nana. En voilà une qui ne se pressait guère ! la veille encore elle avait manqué son entrée. Mais tous se turent, une grande fille venait d’allonger la tête, puis, voyant qu’elle se trompait, avait filé au fond du couloir. C'était Satin, avec un chapeau et une voilette, prenant des airs de dame en visite. « Une jolie roulure ! » murmura Prullière qui la rencontrait depuis un an au café des Variétés. Et Simonne conta comment Nana, ayant reconnu Satin, une ancienne amie de pension, s’était toquée d’elle et tannait Bordenave pour qu’il la fît débuter.","Once again, a heavy peace reigned in the artists' foyer, as if a hundred leagues from this room, where a whole crowd was applauding. Simonne and Clarisse were still on Nana. Here is one that was not in a hurry! the day before she had missed her entrance. But all were silent, a tall girl had just put her head down, then, seeing that she was mistaken, had gone down the hall. It was Satin, with a hat and veil, looking like a visiting lady. “A pretty roll! murmured Prullière, who had met her for a year at the Cafe des Variétés. And Simonne related how Nana, having recognized Satin, an old school friend, had taken a liking to her and harassed Bordenave so that he made her start.","Once more a heavy quiet reigned in the green-room, as though it were a hundred miles away from the crowded audience that was applauding vociferously. Simone and Clarisse were still talking of Nana. She never hurried herself!—only the night before she missed her entrance cue. But they stopped speaking as a tall girl thrust her head in at the door, then, seeing she had made a mistake, hurried off to the end of the passage. It was Satin, wearing a bonnet and veil, and looking like a lady out visiting. “A pretty piece of goods!” murmured Prullière, who had constantly been in the habit of seeing her for a year past at the Café des Variétés. And Simone related how Nana, having come across Satin, an old school-fellow of hers, had taken a great fancy to her, and was bothering Bordenave to bring her out.","A heavy, peaceful, atmosphere again pervaded the greenroom, as though the place were situated a hundred leagues from the house where crowds were applauding. Simonne and Clarisse were still on the topic of Nana. There was a girl who never hurried herself! Why, yesterday she had again come on too late! But there was a silence, for a tall damsel had just craned her head in at the door and, seeing that she had made a mistake, had departed to the other end of the passage. It was Satin. Wearing a hat and a small veil for the nonce she was affecting the manner of a lady about to pay a call. ""A pretty trollop!"" muttered Prulliere, who had been coming across her for a year past at the Cafe des Varietes. And at this Simonne told them how Nana had recognized in Satin an old schoolmate, had taken a vast fancy to her and was now plaguing Bordenave to let her make a first appearance on the stage.","Once again the green room subsided into its drowsy, placid mood, seemingly miles away from that auditorium where a packed house was clapping. Simonne and Clarisse were still on the subject of Nana. She certainly wasn’t the sort of girl to hurry herself! Yesterday she’d again fluffed her entrance! But there was a sudden hush: a tall girl had just stuck her head in and, seeing that she’d opened the wrong door, had precipitately retreated along the corridor. It was Satin wearing a hat with a veil, giving herself airs, like a lady dropping in to pay a call. ‘ A proper little whore!’ muttered Prullière, who’d been running into her in the Café des Variétés for the last year. Simonne explained how Nana had recognized Satin as an old schoolmate, taken a fancy to her, and was pestering Bordenave to give her a start in his theatre."

"Un murmure grandit comme un soupir qui se gonflait. Quelques mains battirent, toutes les jumelles étaient fixées sur Vénus. Peu à peu, Nana avait pris possession du public et maintenant chaque homme la subissait. Le rut qui montait d’elle, ainsi que d’une bête en folie, s’était épandu toujours davantage, emplissant la salle. À cette heure, ses moindres mouvements soufflaient le désir, elle retournait la chair d’un geste de son petit doigt. Des dos s’arrondissaient, vibrant comme si des archets invisibles se fussent promenés sur les muscles, des nuques montraient des poils follets qui s’envolaient sous des haleines tièdes et errantes, venues on ne savait de quelle bouche de femme. Fauchery voyait devant lui l’échappé de collège que la passion soulevait de son fauteuil. Il eut la curiosité de regarder le comte de Vandeuvres, très pâle, les lèvres pincées, le gros Steiner, dont la face apoplectique crevait, Labordette lorgnant d’un air étonné de maquignon 104 qui admire une jument parfaite, Daguenet dont les oreilles saignaient et remuaient de jouissance. Puis, un instinct lui fit jeter un coup d’œil en arrière, et il resta étonné de ce qu’il aperçut dans la loge des Muffat : derrière la comtesse, blanche et sérieuse, le comte se haussait, béant, la face marbrée de taches rouges ; tandis que, près de lui, dans l’ombre, les yeux troubles du marquis de Chouard étaient devenus deux yeux de chat, phosphorescents, pailletés d’or. On suffoquait, les chevelures s’alourdissaient sur les têtes en sueur. Depuis trois heures qu’on était là, les haleines avaient chauffé l’air d’une odeur humaine. Dans le flamboiement du gaz, les poussières en suspension s’épaississaient, immobiles au-dessous du lustre. La salle entière vacillait, glissait à un vertige, lasse et excitée, prise de ces désirs ensommeillés de minuit qui balbutient au fond des alcôves. Et Nana, en face de ce public pâmé, de ces quinze cents personnes entassées, noyées dans l’affaissement et le détraquement nerveux105 d'une fin de spectacle, restait victorieuse avec sa chair de marbre, son sexe assez fort pour détruire tout ce monde et n’en être pas entamé.","A murmur grew like a swelling sigh. A few hands clapped, all the binoculars were fixed on Venus. Little by little, Nana had taken possession of the public and now every man suffered from her. The rut rising from her, like from a mad beast, had spread still further, filling the room. At this hour, her slightest movements breathed desire, she turned the flesh with a gesture of her little finger. Backs were rounded, vibrating as if invisible bows had moved over the muscles, the napes of the necks showed wild hairs that flew away under the warm and wandering breaths, coming from who knew what woman's mouth. Fauchery saw in front of him the escapee from school whom passion lifted from his armchair. He had the curiosity to look at the Comte de Vandeuvres, very pale, with pursed lips, the fat Steiner, whose apoplectic face was bursting, Labordette ogling with the astonished air of a horse dealer who admires a perfect mare, Daguenet whose ears were bleeding and stirred with joy. Then an instinct made him glance back, and he was astonished at what he saw in the Muffats' box: behind the countess, white and serious, the count raised himself, gaping, his face mottled with red spots; while, near him, in the shadows, the troubled eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had become two cat's eyes, phosphorescent, spangled with gold. We were suffocating, the hair grew heavy on the sweating heads. In the three hours we had been there, the breaths had warmed the air with a human odor. In the blaze of the gas, the dust in suspension thickened, motionless below the chandelier. The whole room was tottering, slipping in a vertigo, weary and excited, seized by those sleepy midnight desires which stammer in the depths of the alcoves. And Nana, in front of this swooning audience, of these fifteen hundred people huddled together, drowned in the collapse and the nervous disorder of the end of the show, remained victorious with her flesh of marble, her sex strong enough to destroy everyone. and not be started.","Then arose a murmur resembling one huge sigh. A few hands clapped, and every opera-glass was fixed on Venus. Little by little Nana had gained possession of the audience and now every man succumbed to her. The lust she inspired, similar to an animal in heat, had grown more and more till it filled the house. Now, her slightest movements fanned the desire; the raising of her little finger caused all the flesh beholding her to quiver. Backs were arched, vibrating as though the muscles, like so many fiddle-strings, were being played on by some invisible hand; on the napes of the outstretched necks the down fluttered beneath the warm and errant breath escaped from some women’s lips. Fauchery beheld in front of him the youngster fresh from college start from his seat in his agitation. He had the curiosity to look at the Count de Vandeuvres, who was very pale, with tightly pressed lips—the stout Steiner, whose apoplectic face seemed bursting—Labordette examining through his eyeglass with the astonished look of a jockey admiring a thorough-bred mare—Daguenet, whose ears were flaming red, and trembling with enjoyment. Then, for an instant, he turned round, and was amazed at what he saw in the Muffats’ box: behind the countess, who was looking pale and serious, the count had raised himself up, his mouth wide open, and his face blurred with red blotches; whilst, beside him, in the shadow, the troubled eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had become cat-like in appearance, full of phosphorescence and flecked with gold. The heat was suffocating; even the hair weighed heavily on the perspiring heads. During the three hours that the piece had lasted, the foul breath had given the atmosphere an odour of human flesh. In the blaze of light the dust now appeared thicker, and seemed suspended, motionless, beneath the big crystal gasalier. The audience, tired and excited, seized with those drowsy, midnight desires which murmur their wishes in the depths of alcoves, vacillated, and was gradually becoming dazed. And Nana, facing this half-swooning crowd, these fifteen hundred persons, packed one above the other, and sinking with emotion and the nervous excitement of an approaching finale, remained victorious with her marble flesh, her sex alone strong enough to conquer them all and remain scathless. The play was rapidly drawing to an end.","A murmur of applause swelled and swelled like a growing sigh. There was some hand clapping, and every opera glass was fixed on Venus. Little by little Nana had taken possession of the public, and now every man was her slave. A wave of lust had flowed from her as from an excited animal, and its influence had spread and spread and spread till the whole house was possessed by it. At that moment her slightest movement blew the flame of desire: with her little finger she ruled men's flesh. Backs were arched and quivered as though unseen violin bows had been drawn across their muscles; upon men's shoulders appeared fugitive hairs, which flew in air, blown by warm and wandering breaths, breathed one knew not from what feminine mouth. In front of him Fauchery saw the truant schoolboy half lifted from his seat by passion. Curiosity led him to look at the Count de Vandeuvres--he was extremely pale, and his lips looked pinched--at fat Steiner, whose face was purple to the verge of apoplexy; at Labordette, ogling away with the highly astonished air of a horse dealer admiring a perfectly shaped mare; at Daguenet, whose ears were blood-red and twitching with enjoyment. Then a sudden idea made him glance behind, and he marveled at what he saw in the Muffats' box. Behind the countess, who was white and serious as usual, the count was sitting straight upright, with mouth agape and face mottled with red, while close by him, in the shadow, the restless eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had become catlike phosphorescent, full of golden sparkles. The house was suffocating; people's very hair grew heavy on their perspiring heads. For three hours back the breath of the multitude had filled and heated the atmosphere with a scent of crowded humanity. Under the swaying glare of the gas the dust clouds in mid-air had grown constantly denser as they hung motionless beneath the chandelier. The whole house seemed to be oscillating, to be lapsing toward dizziness in its fatigue and excitement, full, as it was, of those drowsy midnight desires which flutter in the recesses of the bed of passion. And Nana, in front of this languorous public, these fifteen hundred human beings thronged and smothered in the exhaustion and nervous exasperation which belong to the close of a spectacle, Nana still triumphed by right of her marble flesh and that sexual nature of hers, which was strong enough to destroy the whole crowd of her adorers and yet sustain no injury.","A murmur spread through the house like a rising wind. A few people clapped and every opera-glass was focused on Venus. Gradually Nana had asserted her domination over the audience and now she held every man at her mercy. She was like an animal on heat whose ruttishness had permeated the whole theatre. Her slightest movement aroused lust; a jerk of her little finger was sexy. Men were leaning forward with their backs twitching, as if their nerves were being vibrated by invisible violin bows, the warm breath of some mysterious woman was straying over the napes of their necks and setting the wisps of hair quivering. Fauchery could see the truant schoolboy half out of his seat with excitement. Out of curiosity he looked at the Count de Vandeuvres, white-faced and tight-lipped, and at the corpulent Steiner, whose apoplectic face seemed ready to burst; at Labordette, who was peering through his opera-glasses with the surprised look of a horse-dealer admiring a perfect mare; Daguenet whose ears were blood-red and trembling with delight. Then it occurred to him to take a glance over his shoulder, and he was amazed by what he saw in the Muffats’ box: behind the pale, earnest face of the countess, Muffat was standing open-mouthed, his cheeks mottled with purple spots, while next to him in the shadow the bleary eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had turned into two phosphorescent cat’s eyes speckled with gold. People were gasping, their hair was sticky with sweat. They’d been there for three hours, and the atmosphere was stuffy from their breath and the smell of their bodies. In the glare of the gas-jets you could see a thick haze of dust hovering under the chandelier. The whole house was in a trance, their heads were reeling from weariness and excitement, in the grip of that sleepy sort of lust that comes in inarticulate gasps from lovers’ beds in the middle of the night. And facing this ecstatic audience of fifteen hundred people, all crammed together and overcome by the exhaustion and nervous prostration inevitable at the end of any show, Nana’s body, as smooth and white as marble, was all-conquering, her sexuality powerful enough to destroy all these people and remain unscathed. The operetta was drawing to an end."
"Du coup, Nana fut révoltée. Elle ne put retenir ce cri :","Suddenly, Nana was revolted. She could not restrain this cry:","On hearing this, Nana revolted. She could not restrain a cry, “I say, that’s disgusting!",Straightway Nana rebelled. She could not help shouting:,"This was more than Nana could stand. ‘Look, it’s you who’ve got through my ten thousand francs!’ she cried angrily."
"Elle s’était mise debout pour choisir un bookmaker qui eût une bonne figure. Cependant, elle oublia son désir, en apercevant toute une foule de sa connaissance.

Plus loin, dans un huit-ressorts d’une tenue aristocratique, Lucy Stewart, en robe de soie noire très simple, prenait des airs de distinction, à côté d’un grand jeune homme qui portait l’uniforme des aspirants de marine. Mais ce qui stupéfia Nana, ce fut de voir arriver Simonne dans un tandem que Steiner conduisait, avec un laquais derrière, immobile, les bras croisés ; elle était éblouissante, tout en satin blanc, rayé de jaune, couverte de diamants depuis la ceinture jusqu’au chapeau ; tandis que le banquier, allongeant un fouet immense, lançait les deux chevaux attelés en flèche19, le premier un petit alezan 20 doré, au trot de souris, le second un grand bai 21 brun, un stepper22, qui trottait les jambes hautes.","She had stood up to choose a bookmaker who had a good figure.

But what amazed Nana was to see Simonne arrive in a tandem that Steiner was driving, with a lackey behind, motionless, arms crossed; she was dazzling, all in white satin, striped with yellow, covered with diamonds from the belt to the hat; while the banker, stretching out an immense whip, launched the two horses harnessed in arrow19, the first a small golden chestnut 20, at a mouse trot, the second a big bay 21 brown, a stepper22, which trotted with high legs.","She stood up to select a book-maker whose face should take her fancy. But she forgot her intention as she caught sight of a crowd of acquaintances around her. Besides the Mignons, and Gaga, and Clarisse and Blanche, there were on the right, and the left, and behind, in the midst of the mass of vehicles which had now quite shut in her landau, Tatan Néné with Maria Blond in a victoria, Caroline Hequet with her mother and two gentlemen in a calash, Louise Violaine, all alone, and driving a little basket chaiseba bedecked with orange and green ribbons, the colour of the Méchain stable, Léa de Horn on the box seat of a stage-coach, with a crowd of young men who were making a great noise. Farther off, Lucy Stewart, in a very simple black silk dress, was looking most distinguished beside a young man wearing the uniform of a midshipman, in a carriage of most aristocratic appearance. But what really astounded Nana was to see Simone arrive in a trap that Steiner was driving tandem fashion, with a tiger sitting bolt upright behind, bb his arms folded, and quite immovable; she was resplendent, all in white satin striped with yellow, and sparkling with diamonds from her waist to her bonnet, whilst the banker, with a long whip, urged on the two horses, the first a little chestnut, which trotted like a mouse, and the other, a tall bay, a stepper which raised its legs very high.","She had stood up to select a bookmaker with a decent expression of face but forgot what she wanted on perceiving a perfect crowd of her acquaintance. Besides the Mignons, besides Gaga, Clarisse and Blanche, there were present, to the right and left, behind and in the middle of the mass of carriages now hemming in her landau, the following ladies: Tatan Nene and Maria Blond in a victoria, Caroline Hequet with her mother and two gentlemen in an open carriage, Louise Violaine quite alone, driving a little basket chaise decked with orange and green ribbons, the colors of the Mechain stables, and finally, Lea de Horn on the lofty seat of a mail coach, where a band of young men were making a great din. Farther off, in a HUIT RESSORTS of aristocratic appearance, Lucy Stewart, in a very simple black silk dress, sat, looking distinguished beside a tall young man in the uniform of a naval cadet. But what most astounded Nana was the arrival of Simonne in a tandem which Steiner was driving, while a footman sat motionless, with folded arms, behind them. She looked dazzling in white satin striped with yellow and was covered with diamonds from waist to hat. The banker, on his part, was handling a tremendous whip and sending along his two horses, which were harnessed tandemwise, the leader being a little warm-colored chestnut with a mouselike trot, the shaft horse a big brown bay, a stepper, with a fine action.","She stood up to see if she could find a nice-looking bookmaker. However, the sight of a whole crowd of her old cronies put the idea out of her head. Apart from the Mignons and Gaga, Clarisse, and Blanche, in the middle of the mass of carriages now hemming in her landau, she could see, to her left and right behind her, Tatan Néné accompanied by Maria Blond in a victoria, Caroline Héquet in a barouche with her mother and two gentlemen, Louise Violaine all by herself in a little wicker pony-cart with green and orange ribbons, the racing colours of the Méchain stables, Léa de Horn sitting high up on a bench in a mail-coach full of rowdy young men. Beyond them, in a luxuriously aristocratic eight-spring carriage, Lucy Stewart, wearing a very simple black silk dress, was sitting beside a tall young man in a midshipman’s uniform, taking good care to look distinguished. But Nana was amazed to see Simonne arriving in a tandem driven by Steiner, with a footman sitting motionless behind them with his arms crossed; she was dressed all in white satin with a yellow stripe and plastered with diamonds from the waist upwards, including her hat; she looked dazzling; flourishing an immensely long whip, the banker was urging on his two horses, a big, showy, chestnut high-stepper behind a dainty gold bay."
43. Attitude suffisante et vaniteuse.,43. Smug and conceited attitude.,"She occupied, in the Boulevard Haussmann, the second storey of a large new house, the owner of which was content to let to single ladies, in order to get his plaster dried.","The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop--to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze.","The flat was far too big for her and had never been completely furnished; the flashy, opulent, gilt chairs and console tables formed a violent contrast to the second-hand junk, mahogany pedestal tables and zinc candelabra pretending to be Florentine bronze."
"Elle invita Fauchery, qui s’inclina. On ne parla point de la pièce, le nom de Nana ne fut pas prononcé. Le comte gardait une dignité si glacée, qu’on l’aurait cru à quelque séance du Corps législatif94. Il dit simplement, pour expliquer leur présence, que son beau-père aimait le théâtre. La porte de la loge avait dû rester ouverte, le marquis de Chouard, qui était sorti afin de laisser sa place aux visiteurs, redressait sa haute taille de vieillard, la face molle et blanche sous un chapeau à larges bords95, suivant de ses yeux troubles les femmes qui passaient.","She invited Fauchery, who bowed. No one spoke of the play, Nana's name was not mentioned. The Count retained such icy dignity that one would have thought him at some session of the Legislative Body. He simply says, to explain their presence, that his stepfather loved the theater. The door to the box must have been left open, the Marquis de Chouard, who had gone out to make way for visitors, straightened his tall old man's stature, his face soft and white under a wide-brimmed hat, following with his troubled eyes passing women.","And she extended her invitation to Fauchery, who thanked her with a low bow. The play was not alluded to, nor was the name of Nana pronounced. The count’s manner was so icy and dignified, that one might have supposed him to be at a meeting of the Corps Législatif.n He took occasion to say, as if to explain their presence, that his father-in-law had an especial fondness for the theatre. The door of the box had remained open, and the Marquis de Chouard, who had gone out to leave room for the visitors, now stood tall and erect in the doorway, his pale, flabby face shaded by his broad-brimmed hat, as he followed with his dim eyes the women who passed.","""We count on you next Tuesday,"" said the countess to La Faloise, and she invited Fauchery, who bowed. Not a word was said of the play; Nana's name was not once mentioned. The count was so glacially dignified that he might have been supposed to be taking part at a sitting of the legislature. In order to explain their presence that evening he remarked simply that his father-in-law was fond of the theater. The door of the box must have remained open, for the Marquis de Chouard, who had gone out in order to leave his seat to the visitors, was back again. He was straightening up his tall, old figure. His face looked soft and white under a broad-brimmed hat, and with his restless eyes he followed the movements of the women who passed.","And she invited Fauchery, who accepted with a bow. No one said anything about the play; Nana’s name was never mentioned. The count maintained the frigid, dignified attitude that you might see at a sitting of the Legislative Body. He explained their presence at the performance merely by saying that his father-in-law liked going to the theatre. The Marquis de Chouard had gone outside to make room for the callers; the door had been left open and he was standing there, a tall, erect old gentleman with a pale fleshy face under his broad-brimmed hat, following the passing women with his bleary gaze."

"Alors, elle lâcha ce qui lui venait à la bouche. Oui, oui, elle n’était pas une bête, elle voyait clair. On s’était fichu d’elle pendant le souper, on avait dit des horreurs pour montrer qu’on la méprisait. Un tas de salopes qui ne lui allaient pas à la cheville ! Plus souvent qu’elle se donnerait encore du tintouin, histoire de se faire bêcher ensuite ! Elle ne savait pas ce qui la retenait de flanquer tout ce sale monde à la porte. Et, la rage l’étranglant, sa voix se brisa dans les sanglots.","So she let go of what came to her mouth. Yes, yes, she was not an animal, she saw clearly. We had made fun of her during supper, we had said horrible things to show that we despised her. A bunch of sluts that didn't match her! More often than she would gossip about, just to get dug up afterwards! She didn't know what was keeping her from throwing all those filthy people out the door. And, rage strangling him, his voice broke in sobs.","Then she uttered everything that came readily to her tongue. Yes, yes, she wasn’t an idiot; she could see what it all meant. They had all made a fool of her during supper. They had said the most beastly things, just to show that they didn’t care a curse for her. A parcel of strumpets, who were not fit to clean her boots. She wouldn’t worry herself for them another time, just to be treated in that scurvy way afterwards! She didn’t know what it was kept her from kicking the whole dirty lot out of the place; and, her rage choking her, she sobbed aloud.","Thereupon she gave vent to any expression that occurred to her. Yes, oh yes, SHE wasn't a ninny--she could see clearly enough. They had been making devilish light of her during supper and saying all sorts of frightful things to show that they thought nothing of her! A pack of sluts who weren't fit to black her boots! Catch her bothering herself again just to be badgered for it after! She really didn't know what kept her from chucking all that dirty lot out of the house! And with this, rage choked her and her voice broke down in sobs.","And she started to pour out everything that came to her lips. Oh, she wasn’t all that stupid, she could see all right. All through the meal, they’d been saying horrible things to show how much they despised her. A bunch of dirty bitches who weren’t fit to clean her shoes! It’d be a long time before she took all that trouble again, just so people could pull her to pieces afterwards! She didn’t know why she didn’t kick the whole bloody lot out on their arses! She was choking with anger and her voice was breaking into sobs."
"On montait se coucher, quand Muffat se présenta. Ce fut Labordette qui l’aperçut dans le jardin. Il comprit, il lui rendit le service d’écarter Steiner et de le conduire par la main, le long du corridor obscur, jusqu’à la chambre de Nana. Labordette, pour ces sortes d’affaires, était d’une distinction parfaite, très adroit, et comme ravi de faire le bonheur des autres. Nana ne se montra pas surprise, ennuyée seulement de la rage de Muffat après elle. Il fallait être sérieuse dans la vie, n’est-ce pas ? C'était trop bête d’aimer, ça ne menait à rien. Puis, elle avait des scrupules, à cause du jeune âge de Zizi ; vrai, elle s’était conduite d’une façon pas honnête. Ma foi ! elle rentrait dans le bon chemin, elle prenait un vieux.","They were going up to bed when Muffat presented himself. It was Labordette who saw him in the garden. He understood, he did her the favor of pushing Steiner aside and leading him by the hand along the dark corridor to Nana's room. Labordette, in this sort of business, was of perfect distinction, very skilful, and as if delighted to make others happy. Nana showed no surprise, only annoyed by Muffat's rage at her. You had to be serious in life, right? It was too stupid to love, it was leading nowhere. Then, she had scruples, because of Zizi's young age; true, she had behaved in a way that was not honest. My faith! she was going back on the right path, she was taking an old man.","When Muffat arrived, they were all just going up to bed. Labordette noticed him in the garden, and, understanding his object, rendered him the service of getting Steiner out of the way, and of leading him by the hand along the dark passage to the door of Nana’s room. Labordette, for this sort of jobs, had a most gentlemanly way, was very dexterous, and seemed delighted at conducing to another’s happiness. Nana showed no surprise, but merely felt bored by Muffat’s persistence. However, one must have an eye for business during life! It was stupid to love, it led to nothing. Besides, she had scruples on account of Zizi’s youth: she had really behaved disgracefully. Well! she would return to the right path, and go for the old fellow.","The household were going upstairs to bed when Muffat put in an appearance. It was Labordette who caught sight of him in the garden. He understood it all at once and did him a service, for he got Steiner out of the way and, taking his hand, led him along the dark corridor as far as Nana's bedroom. In affairs of this kind Labordette was wont to display the most perfect tact and cleverness. Indeed, he seemed delighted to be making other people happy. Nana showed no surprise; she was only somewhat annoyed by the excessive heat of Muffat's pursuit. Life was a serious affair, was it not? Love was too silly: it led to nothing. Besides, she had her scruples in view of Zizi's tender age. Indeed, she had scarcely behaved quite fairly toward him. Dear me, yes, she was choosing the proper course again in taking up with an old fellow.","As they were going to bed, Muffat arrived. It was Labordette who sighted him in the garden, realized what was afoot, helped him by keeping Steiner out of the way, and led him by the hand along a dark passageway up to Nana’s bedroom. In such matters, Labordette had the perfect touch: discreet, shrewd, and, as it were, utterly delighted at making other people happy. Although she was annoyed, Nana showed no surprise at seeing Muffat pursuing her so passionately. Life was real and life was earnest, wasn’t it? Love was stupid, it got you nowhere. And she did have qualms about Zizi because he was so young; she really had behaved badly there. Ah well, she was going to get back on to the right track , she’d go for an old man …"

"Elle se mit à rire, sans répondre, et lui posa un baiser sur le front. Jusqu’à ce jour, elle l’avait traité en gamin, ne prenant pas ses déclarations au sérieux, s’amusant de lui comme d’un petit homme sans conséquence. Ce fut une affaire pour l’installer. Elle voulut absolument qu’on allumât le feu dans sa chambre ; on serait mieux là. La vue de Georges n’avait pas surpris Zoé, habituée à toutes les rencontres. Mais le jardinier, qui montait le bois, resta interloqué en apercevant ce monsieur ruisselant d’eau, auquel il était certain de ne pas avoir ouvert la porte. On le renvoya, on n’avait plus besoin de lui. Une lampe éclairait la pièce, le feu jetait une grande flamme claire.","She began to laugh, without answering, and placed a kiss on his forehead. To this day, she had treated him like a child, not taking his statements seriously, laughing at him like a little man of no consequence. It was a bargain to install it. She absolutely wanted the fire to be lit in her room; we would be better off there. The sight of Georges had not surprised Zoé, accustomed to all encounters. But the gardener, who was mounting the wood, was taken aback when he saw this gentleman dripping with water, to whom he was sure he had not opened the door. We fired him, we didn't need him anymore. A lamp illuminated the room, the fire threw a large clear flame.","She began to laugh without answering, and kissed him on the forehead. Until that day she had treated him like a child, not thinking seriously of his declarations, and amusing herself with him as with a youngster of no consequence. She made a great deal of fuss so that he should be comfortable. She insisted on the fire lighted in her bed-room. They would be more cozy there. The sight of George did not surprise Zoé, used to all sorts of meetings; but the gardener, who brought up some wood, was struck dumb on seeing the gentleman dripping with water, to whom he was certain he had not opened the door. He was sent away, as nothing more was required. A lamp lighted the room, whilst the fire burst into a bright blaze.","She made no reply but burst out laughing and gave him a kiss on the forehead. Up till today she had always treated him like a naughty urchin, never taking his declarations seriously and amusing herself at his expense as though he were a little man of no consequence whatever. There was much ado to install him in the house. She absolutely insisted on the fire being lit in her bedroom, as being the most comfortable place for his reception. Georges had not surprised Zoe, who was used to all kinds of encounters, but the gardener, who brought the wood upstairs, was greatly nonplused at sight of this dripping gentleman to whom he was certain he had not opened the front door. He was, however, dismissed, as he was no longer wanted. A lamp lit up the room, and the fire burned with a great bright flame.","Her only reply was a laugh and a kiss on the forehead. Up to now she’d been treating him as a little boy, never taking his protestations of love seriously and making fun of him as just a whipper-snapper. Making him comfortable was quite a business. She insisted on having a fire lit in her own bedroom; they’d be better off there. Zoé hadn’t been surprised to see Georges, she was used to every sort of rendezvous; but when the gardener brought up the logs, he was dumbfounded to see the young gentleman streaming with water; he certainly had never let him in himself. They told him he could go, he wasn’t needed anymore. A lamp had been lit and the fire was blazing cheerfully."
"Mais madame Lerat n’avait pas cette philosophie. Chaque fois que Nana lui montrait un nouveau bleu sur sa peau blanche, elle poussait les hauts cris. On lui tuait sa nièce, ça ne pouvait plus durer. À la vérité, Fontan avait mis à la porte madame Lerat, en disant qu’il ne voulait plus la rencontrer chez lui ; et, depuis ce jour, quand elle était là et qu’il rentrait, elle devait s’en aller par la cuisine, ce qui l’humiliait horriblement. Aussi ne tarissait-elle pas contre ce grossier personnage. Elle lui reprochait surtout d’être mal élevé, avec des mines de femme comme il faut, à qui personne ne pouvait en remontrer sur la bonne éducation.","But Madame Lerat did not have this philosophy. Each time Nana showed her a new bruise on her white skin, she cried out loud. They were killing his niece, it couldn't go on any longer. In truth, Fontan had dismissed Madame Lerat, saying that he no longer wished to meet her at his house; and from that day on, when she was there and he came in, she had to go through the kitchen, which humiliated her horribly. Also she did not stop against this coarse character. Above all, she reproached him for being badly brought up, with the looks of a decent woman, whom no one could remonstrate with about good education.","But Madame Lerat was not gifted with similar philosophy. Each time Nana showed her a fresh bruise on her white skin, she complained loudly. Her niece was being murdered; it could not last. The truth was, Fontan had turned Madame Lerat out, and said that he would not have her in the place again; and, ever since that day, if she happened to be there when he returned home, she was obliged to take her departure by way of the kitchen, which humiliated her immensely. And so she never ceased abusing that unmannerly person. With the airs of a most well-bred woman, to whom no one could teach anything pertaining to a polite education, she reproached him with having been shockingly badly brought up.","But Mme Lerat had less philosophy. Every time Nana showed her a fresh bruise on the white skin she screamed aloud. They were killing her niece; things couldn't go on as they were doing. As a matter of fact, Fontan had turned Mme Lerat out of doors and had declared that he would not have her at his house in the future, and ever since that day, when he returned home and she happened to be there, she had to make off through the kitchen, which was a horrible humiliation to her. Accordingly she never ceased inveighing against that brutal individual. She especially blamed his ill breeding, pursing up her lips, as she did so, like a highly respectable lady whom nobody could possibly remonstrate with on the subject of good manners.","But Madame Lerat wasn’t so philosophical and vented her indignation every time she saw a fresh bruise on her white flesh. Her niece was being killed, that sort of thing couldn’t go on … In fact, Fontan had shown Madame Lerat the door, saying that he didn’t want to see her face again in his house; and ever since, whenever he came home and she was there she had to slip away through the kitchen, which she found extremely humiliating. As a result she never stopped attacking him: he was a lout. Her principal criticism was his vulgarity, which she expressed in a very lady-like way, to emphasize the fact that she herself was impeccably well bred."
"« Mais, ma chère... tâcha-t-il d’expliquer.","“But, my dear…” he tried to explain.","“But, my dear—” he attempted to explain.","But, my dear--"" he endeavored to explain.",‘But my dear Nana . . .’ he started to explain.

"Cependant, les artistes en paletot, le visage las, partaient un à un. Des groupes d’hommes et de femmes descendaient le petit escalier tournant, mettaient dans l’ombre des profils de chapeaux défoncés, de châles fripés, une laideur blême de cabotins qui ont enlevé leur rouge. Sur la scène, où l’on éteignait les portants et les herses, le prince écoutait une anecdote de Bordenave. Il voulait attendre Nana. Quand celle-ci parut enfin, la scène était noire, le pompier de service, achevant sa ronde, promenait une lanterne. Bordenave, pour éviter à Son Altesse le détour du passage des Panoramas, venait de faire ouvrir le couloir qui va de la loge de la concierge au vestibule du théâtre. Et c’était, le long de cette allée, un sauve-qui-peut de petites femmes heureuses d’échapper aux hommes en train de poser dans le passage. Elles se bousculaient, serrant les coudes, jetant des regards en arrière, respirant seulement dehors ; tandis que Fontan, Bosc et Prullière se retiraient lentement, en blaguant la tête des hommes sérieux, qui arpentaient la galerie des Variétés, à l’heure où les petites femmes filaient par le boulevard, avec des amants de cœur. Mais Clarisse surtout fut maligne. Elle se méfiait de la Faloise. En effet, il était encore là, dans la loge, en compagnie des messieurs qui s’entêtaient sur les chaises de madame Bron. Tous tendaient le nez. Alors, elle passa raide, derrière une amie. Ces messieurs clignaient les paupières, ahuris par cette dégringolade de jupes tourbillonnant au pied de l’étroit escalier, désespérés d’attendre depuis si longtemps, pour les voir ainsi s’envoler toutes, sans en reconnaître une seule. La portée des chats noirs dormait sur la toile cirée, contre le ventre de la mère, béate et les pattes élargies ; pendant que le gros chat rouge, assis à l’autre bout de la table, la queue allongée, regardait de ses yeux jaunes les femmes se sauver.","Meanwhile, the artists in overcoats, weary faces, left one by one. Groups of men and women descended the little winding staircase, casting in the shade the profiles of battered hats, wrinkled shawls, the pale ugliness of playboys who had taken off their rouge. On the stage, where the racks and the portcullis were being turned off, the prince was listening to an anecdote by Bordenave. He wanted to wait for Nana. When it finally appeared, the scene was dark, the fireman on duty, finishing his rounds, was carrying a lantern. Bordenave, in order to spare His Highness the detour of the Passage des Panoramas, had just opened the corridor leading from the concierge's lodge to the vestibule of the theatre. And it was, along this alley, a scramble of little women happy to escape the men posing in the passage. They jostled each other, clasping their elbows, glancing back, only breathing outside; while Fontan, Bosc and Prullière withdrew slowly, joking the heads of the serious men who paced the Galerie des Variétés, at the hour when the little women were scurrying down the boulevard with sweethearts. But Clarisse above all was clever. She mistrusted La Faloise. In fact, he was still there, in the box, in the company of the gentlemen who were stubbornly seated on Madame Bron's chairs. All of them looked up. So she passed stiffly, behind a friend. These gentlemen blinked, bewildered by this tumble of skirts whirling at the foot of the narrow staircase, desperate to wait so long, to see them all fly away without recognizing a single one. The litter of black cats slept on the oilcloth, against the mother's belly, blissful and with outstretched paws; while the big red cat, seated at the other end of the table, its tail stretched out, watched with its yellow eyes the women running away.","The actors, with their overcoats on, and looking very fatigued, now began to leave one by one. Groups of men and women went down the little winding staircase, casting shadows of old knocked-about hats and ragged shawls on the wall, with the ghastliness of strollers who have wiped off their rouge. On the stage, where all the gas-jets were being turned out, the prince was listening to an anecdote of Bordenave’s. He was waiting for Nana. When she at length appeared, the stage was in darkness, and the fireman was going round with a lantern giving a last look to everything. To save His Highness from having to go through the Passage des Panoramas, Bordenave had the doors opened of the corridor leading from near the doorkeeper’s room to the vestibule of the theatre, and several of the women scurried along there, delighted at escaping from the men who were waiting for them outside the stage-door. They pushed against each other, squeezing their way through, glancing back every instant, and holding their breath until they found themselves outside; whilst Fontan, Bosc, and Prulliere moved slowly off home, joking amongst themselves about the ladies’ protectors—solemn-looking gentlemen, who were walking up and down the Galerie des Variétés near the stage-door, at the same time that the damsels themselves were hastening along the Boulevards in the company of the chosen ones of their hearts. But Clarisse was especially cunning. She determined to beware of La Faloise. And, in fact, he was still in the doorkeeper’s room with the other gentlemen who obstinately stuck to Madame Bron’s chairs. They were all watching and listening intently; so, keeping close to a friend, she passed rapidly before them. The gentlemen blinked their eyes, bewildered by the rapid succession of skirts whirling round at the foot of the narrow stair-case, and quite despondent, after having waited so long for the ladies, at seeing them all disappear like that without being able to recognise a single one. The litter of black kittens were asleep on the oil-cloth, cuddled up against their mother, who, with a look of intense happiness, had separated her legs to receive them; whilst the big tortoise-shell cat, seated at the other end of the table with its tail stretched out, watched with its yellow eyes the women hurrying away.","Meanwhile the worn-looking artistes were dropping off one after the other in their outdoor coats. Groups of men and women were coming down the little winding staircase, and the outlines of battered hats and worn-out shawls were visible in the shadows. They looked colorless and unlovely, as became poor play actors who have got rid of their paint. On the stage, where the side lights and battens were being extinguished, the prince was listening to an anecdote Bordenave was telling him. He was waiting for Nana, and when at length she made her appearance the stage was dark, and the fireman on duty was finishing his round, lantern in hand. Bordenave, in order to save His Highness going about by the Passage des Panoramas, had made them open the corridor which led from the porter's lodge to the entrance hall of the theater. Along this narrow alley little women were racing pell-mell, for they were delighted to escape from the men who were waiting for them in the other passage. They went jostling and elbowing along, casting apprehensive glances behind them and only breathing freely when they got outside. Fontan, Bosc and Prulliere, on the other hand, retired at a leisurely pace, joking at the figure cut by the serious, paying admirers who were striding up and down the Galerie des Varietes at a time when the little dears were escaping along the boulevard with the men of their hearts. But Clarisse was especially sly. She had her suspicions about La Faloise, and, as a matter of fact, he was still in his place in the lodge among the gentlemen obstinately waiting on Mme Bron's chairs. They all stretched forward, and with that she passed brazenly by in the wake of a friend. The gentlemen were blinking in bewilderment over the wild whirl of petticoats eddying at the foot of the narrow stairs. It made them desperate to think they had waited so long, only to see them all flying away like this without being able to recognize a single one. The litter of little black cats were sleeping on the oilcloth, nestled against their mother's belly, and the latter was stretching her paws out in a state of beatitude while the big tortoise-shell cat sat at the other end of the table, her tail stretched out behind her and her yellow eyes solemnly following the flight of the women.","Meanwhile the tired-looking actors in their overcoats were leaving one by one; groups of men and women were coming down the spiral staircase; in the shadows, you could see the outlines of battered hats, tatty scarves, the pallor and ugliness of actors without their grease-paint. On the stage the battens and set-piece lights were being extinguished, and the prince was listening to one of Bordenave’s anecdotes while waiting for Nana. When she finally arrived, the stage was in darkness and the duty fireman was completing his rounds, lamp in hand. To save His Highness from having to go out through the Passage des Panoramas, Bordenave had arranged to open the passage leading from the door-keeper’s lodge to the lobby. His ‘girls’ immediately started scuttling away through it, glad to be able to avoid the men waiting for them in the passageway. They were huddled together, jostling each other, looking back over their shoulders, hardly daring to breathe until they were outside; Bosc and Prullière on the other hand made their way out slowly, laughing when they saw the men earnestly pacing up and down the Variétés Arcade while the young women dashed off along the boulevard with their fancy men. Clarisse was particularly crafty; she didn’t trust la Faloise. And in fact he was still in the lodge with the others, all doggedly waiting, on the alert, on Madame Bron’s chairs. She shot past like a streak of lightning, hiding behind a friend. The men blinked, bewildered by this sudden rush of swirling skirts at the foot of the staircase and miserable at having waited so long only to see them make their get-away without being able to recognize a single one of them. The litter of black kittens had gone to sleep on the oilcloth tucked against the belly of their mother, lying blissfully with her paws outspread; meanwhile the fat ginger cat was sitting with outstretched tail on the other end of the table watching the women make their escape through his yellow eyes."

"Un soir, en venant prendre Satin, elle reconnut le marquis de Chouard qui descendait l’escalier, les jambes cassées, se traînant sur la rampe, avec une figure blanche. Elle feignit de se moucher. Puis, en haut, comme elle trouvait Satin dans une saleté affreuse, le ménage lâché depuis huit jours, un lit infect, des pots qui traînaient, elle s’étonna que celle-ci connût le marquis. Ah ! oui, elle le connaissait ; même qu’il les avait joliment embêtés, elle et son pâtissier, quand ils étaient ensemble ! Maintenant, il revenait de temps à autre ; mais il l’assommait, il reniflait dans tous les endroits pas propres, jusque dans ses pantoufles.","One evening, on coming to pick up Satin, she recognized the Marquis de Chouard coming down the stairs, his legs broken, dragging himself along the banister, with a white face. She pretended to blow her nose. Then, upstairs, as she found Satin in dreadful filth, the housework abandoned for a week, a filthy bed, pots lying around, she was surprised that the latter knew the Marquis. Ah! yes, she knew him; even that he had bothered them, her and her pastry cook, when they were together! Now he came back from time to time; but he stunned him, he sniffed in all the dirty places, even in his slippers.","One night, on calling for Satin, she recognised the Marquis de Chouard coming down the stairs, leaning heavily on the balustrade, his legs yielding beneath him, and his face ghastly pale. She took out her handkerchief and pretended to blow her nose; then, when she found Satin surrounded by the accustomed filth, the room not having been touched for more than a week past, basins and other utensils lying about on all sides, the bed in a most dirty condition, she expressed her astonishment that her friend should know the marquis. Ah, yes! she knew him; in fact, he had been an awful nuisance when she and her pastrycook were living together! Now, he came from time to time; but he pestered her immensely. He sniffed about in every dirty place he could find, even in her slippers.","One evenlng when she came to call for Satin she recognized the Marquis de Chouard. He was coming downstairs with quaking legs; his face was ashen white, and he leaned heavily on the banisters. She pretended to be blowing her nose. Upstairs she found Satin amid indescribable filth. No household work had been done for a week; her bed was disgusting, and ewers and basins were standing about in all directions. Nana expressed surprise at her knowing the marquis. Oh yes, she knew him! He had jolly well bored her confectioner and her when they were together. At present he used to come back now and then, but he nearly bothered her life out, going sniffing into all the dirty corners--yes, even into her slippers!","One night when coming to pick up Satin, she recognized the Marquis de Chouard tottering downstairs, white-faced and clutching the banister. She pretended to be blowing her nose. When she got upstairs, seeing the dreadful squalor in which Satin lived, with everything neglected from one week’s end to the next, she expressed surprise that Satin knew the marquis. Oh yes, she knew him all right, and what a bore he’d been for her and her pastry-cook boyfriend when they’d been together! Now he came back occasionally but he got on her nerves , he used to stick his nose in every little dirty corner, even sniffing her slippers."
"Nana avait donc trouvé le moyen de suffire à tout. La maison, certains jours, regorgeait de nourriture. Deux fois par semaine, Bosc prenait des indigestions. Un soir que Mme Lerat se retirait, enragée de voir au feu un dîner copieux dont elle ne mangerait pas, elle ne put s’empêcher de demander brutalement qui est-ce qui payait. Nana, surprise, devint toute bête et se mit à pleurer.","Nana had therefore found a way to suffice for everything. The house, on some days, was overflowing with food. Twice a week Bosc suffered from indigestion.

Nana, surprised, became quite stupid and began to cry.","Nana had therefore found means of supplying everything. On certain days the house was glutted with food. Bosc feasted there so sumptuously twice a week that he suffered from indigestion. One evening as Madame Lerat was leaving, angry at seeing before the fire an abundant dinner of which she was not to partake, she could not resist bluntly asking who it was who paid for it. Nana, taken by surprise, no longer knew what she was about and began to cry.","Nana had indeed found means to provide for all needs, and the place on certain days overflowed with good things. Twice a week, regularly, Bosc had indigestion. One evening as Mme Lerat was withdrawing from the scene in high dudgeon because she had noticed a copious dinner she was not destined to eat in process of preparation, she could not prevent herself asking brutally who paid for it all. Nana was taken by surprise; she grew foolish and began crying.","Nana had found a means of providing everything. Some days the house was positively overflowing with food.

"Il se fit un silence embarrassé. Bordenave, jugeant qu’il était de trop, s’éloigna. Le comte restait la tête basse.

"Nana s’était résignée, pour avoir la paix dans son ménage. Puis, c’était la faute de la Tricon, qu’elle avait rencontrée rue de Laval, un jour que Fontan était parti furieux, à cause d’un plat de morue54. Alors, elle avait dit oui à la Tricon, qui justement se trouvait en peine. Comme Fontan ne rentrait jamais avant six heures, elle disposait de son après-midi, elle rapportait quarante francs55, soixante francs, quelquefois davantage. Elle aurait pu parler par dix et quinze louis, si elle avait su garder sa situation ; mais elle était encore bien contente de trouver là de quoi faire bouillir la marmite. Le soir, elle oubliait tout, lorsque Bosc crevait de nourriture, et que Fontan, les coudes sur la table, se laissait baiser les yeux de l’air supérieur d’un homme qui est aimé pour lui-même.","Nana had resigned herself, to have peace in her household. Then it was the fault of La Tricon, whom she had met in the rue de Laval one day when Fontan had left in a rage over a dish of cod. So she had said yes to the Tricon, who was in trouble. As Fontan never came home before six o'clock, she had her afternoon at her disposal, she brought in forty francs,55 sixty francs, sometimes more. She could have spoken by ten and fifteen louis, if she had known how to keep her position; but she was still very happy to find something there to boil the pot. In the evening, she forgot everything, when Bosc was starving for food, and Fontan, his elbows on the table, allowed his eyes to be kissed with the superior air of a man who is loved for himself.","Nana had resigned herself for the sake of peace and quietness in her home. It was partly, too, the fault of old Tricon, whom she had met in the Rue de Laval one day when Fontan had gone off in a fury because there had been nothing but salt cod for dinner. So she had said “yes” to old Tricon, who happened to be in a difficulty. After that, as Fontan never came home before six in the evening, she was able to dispose of her afternoons, and often brought back as much as forty or sixty francs, and sometimes more. She might have made as much as ten and fifteen louis had she been entirely free; but still she was very glad to get enough to keep things going. At night-time she forgot all, when Bosc was almost bursting with food, and Fontan, with his elbows on the table, let her kiss his eyes with the self-satisfied air of a man who is loved for himself alone.","Nana had resigned herself to it for the sake of enjoying peace in her own home. Then, too, the Tricon was to blame. She had come across her in the Rue de Laval one fine day when Fontan had gone out raging about a dish of cod. She had accordingly consented to the proposals made her by the Tricon, who happened just then to be in difficulty. As Fontan never came in before six o'clock, she made arrangements for her afternoons and used to bring back forty francs, sixty francs, sometimes more. She might have made it a matter of ten and fifteen louis had she been able to maintain her former position, but as matters stood she was very glad thus to earn enough to keep the pot boiling. At night she used to forget all her sorrows when Bosc sat there bursting with dinner and Fontan leaned on his elbows and with an expression of lofty superiority becoming a man who is loved for his own sake allowed her to kiss him on the eyelids.","Nana had given in for the sake of a quiet life. Anyway, Tricon was to blame. Nana had met her in the Rue de Laval one day when Fontan had stormed out because she’d served up some cod.

As Fontan never came back before six she had her afternoons free, and she could bring home forty or sixty francs, sometimes more.

"Alors, elles étouffèrent leurs rires, regardant avec une peur sourde, de l’autre côté de l’avenue, deux figures noires qui marchaient d’un pas cadencé. Nana, dans son luxe, dans sa royauté de femme obéie, avait conservé une épouvante de la police, n’aimant pas à en entendre parler, pas plus que de la mort. Elle éprouvait un malaise, quand un sergent de ville levait les yeux sur son hôtel. On ne savait jamais avec ces gens-là. Ils pourraient très bien les prendre pour des filles, s’ils les entendaient rire, à cette heure de nuit. Satin s’était serrée contre Nana, dans un petit frisson. Pourtant, elles restèrent, intéressées par l’approche d’une lanterne, dansante au milieu des flaques de la chaussée. C'était une vieille chiffonnière qui fouillait les ruisseaux. Satin la reconnut.","Then they stifled their laughter, gazing in dull fear across the avenue at two black figures walking in quick step. Nana, in her luxury, in her royalty as an obedient woman, had retained a dread of the police, not liking to hear of them any more than of death. She felt uneasy when a policeman looked up at her hotel. You never knew with these people. They could very well take them for girls, if they heard them laughing, at this hour of the night. Satin had hugged Nana, shivering slightly. Yet they remained, interested in the approach of a lantern, dancing in the middle of the puddles of the road. She was an old ragpicker who searched the streams. Satin recognized her.","Then they smothered their laughter, watching with a dumb fear two black figures walking in step on the other side of the Avenue. Nana, in all her luxury—in her royalty of a woman whom every one obeyed—had preserved a dread of the police, not liking to hear them spoken of any more than she did death. She felt uneasy whenever she saw a policeman look up at her house. One never knew what to expect from such people. They might very well take them for some low gay women, if they heard them laughing at that time of the night. Satin tremblingly pressed close up against Nana. Yet they remained there, interested by the approach of a light dancing in the midst of the puddles on the pavement. It was the lantern of an old female rag-picker who was searching the gutters. Satin recognised her.","Thereupon they smothered their laughter and gazed in secret fear at two dark figures walking with measured tread on the opposite side of the avenue. Amid all her luxurious surroundings, amid all the royal splendors of the woman whom all must obey, Nana still stood in horror of the police and did not like to hear them mentioned any oftener than death. She felt distinctly unwell when a policeman looked up at her house. One never knew what such people might do! They might easily take them for loose women if they heard them laughing at that hour of the night. Satin, with a little shudder, had squeezed herself up against Nana. Nevertheless, the pair stayed where they were and were soon interested in the approach of a lantern, the light of which danced over the puddles in the road. It was an old ragpicker woman who was busy raking in the gutters. Satin recognized her.","They stifled their laughter and watched two dark figures walking in step on the other side of the avenue. They were both still secretly afraid of the police; Nana in particular, despite all her luxury, her almost royal status as a woman who dictated to everybody, had never lost her terror of them and disliked hearing them mentioned as much as she hated any mention of death. One of the police looked upwards; Nana felt anxious: you never knew with that lot, they might very well take them for prostitutes if they heard them laughing at that time of night. Satin gave a little shiver and snuggled up against Nana. But they didn’t leave the window; their interest had been caught by an approaching lantern, bobbing about amidst the puddles on the roadway. It was an elderly ragwoman rummaging about in the gutter. Satin recognized her."
"Nana, qui pleurait à petits soupirs, retint son souffle. Quand il fut couché, elle étouffa, elle se jeta sur sa poitrine en sanglotant. Leurs batteries se terminaient toujours par là ; elle tremblait de le perdre, elle avait un lâche besoin de le savoir à elle, malgré tout. À deux reprises, il la repoussa d’un geste superbe. Mais l’embrassement tiède de cette femme qui le suppliait, avec ses grands yeux mouillés de bête fidèle, le chauffa d’un désir. Et il se fit bon prince, sans pourtant s’abaisser à aucune avance ; il se laissa caresser et prendre de force, en homme dont le pardon vaut la peine d’être gagné. Puis, il fut saisi d’une inquiétude, il craignait que Nana ne jouât une comédie pour ravoir la clef de la caisse. La bougie était éteinte, lorsqu’il éprouva le besoin de maintenir sa volonté.","Nana, who was weeping with little sighs, held her breath. When he was in bed, she choked, she threw herself on his chest, sobbing.

But the warm embrace of this woman who begged him, with her big watery eyes of a faithful animal, warmed him with a desire. And he made himself a good prince, without however lowering himself to any advance; he allowed himself to be caressed and taken by force, like a man whose forgiveness is worth earning. Then he was seized with anxiety, he feared that Nana was playing a comedy to get back the key to the box. The candle was extinguished when he felt the need to maintain his will.","Nana, who was weeping bitterly, held her breath.

He twice pushed her away with a haughty gesture; but the warm embrace of the supplicating woman, with her large tearful eyes, resembling those of some faithful animal, kindled a flame of desire within him. And he acted the good prince, without, however, stooping to make any advances. He let himself be caressed, and, so to say, taken by force, in the style of a man whose forgiveness is worth winning. Then he was seized with anxiety. He feared that Nana had only been acting a little comedy to get possession of the cash again. He had blown out the candle, when he thought it necessary to assert once more his authority.","Nana, who was crying and gasping, thereupon held her breath. When he was in bed she choked with emotion and threw herself upon his breast with a wild burst of sobs. Their scuffles always ended thus, for she trembled at the thought of losing him and, like a coward, wanted always to feel that he belonged entirely to her, despite everything. Twice he pushed her magnificently away, but the warm embrace of this woman who was begging for mercy with great, tearful eyes, as some faithful brute might do, finally aroused desire. And he became royally condescending without, however, lowering his dignity before any of her advances. In fact, he let himself be caressed and taken by force, as became a man whose forgiveness is worth the trouble of winning. Then he was seized with anxiety, fearing that Nana was playing a part with a view to regaining possession of the treasury key. The light had been extinguished when he felt it necessary to reaffirm his will and pleasure.","Nana held her breath to quieten her little sobs and when Fontan joined her in bed, she flung herself choking and in tears on to his chest. Their fights always ended like this; she was desperately afraid of losing him, and in spite of everything she needed to know he belonged to her. Twice he pushed her away with a majestic gesture, but the cosy embrace of this woman cowardly begging for mercy, like a faithful hound with large, tearful eyes, excited him and he relented, though not condescending to make any advances himself, letting her stroke and fondle him and take him by force, like a man whose forgiveness is worth working for. Afterwards he felt uneasy, afraid that Nana might be putting on an act to get back the key of the cash-box. The candle had been put out; he felt the need to assert his authority:"

Une autre fois, dans la chambre, après un silence, elle sanglota au cou du petit, en balbutiant qu’elle avait peur de mourir. Elle chantait souvent à demi-voix, une romance de madame Lerat, pleine de fleurs et d’oiseaux, s’attendrissant aux larmes, s’interrompant pour prendre Georges dans une étreinte de passion, en exigeant de lui des serments d’amour éternel. Enfin, elle était bête, comme elle le reconnaissait elle-même, lorsque tous les deux, redevenus camarades, fumaient des cigarettes au bord du lit, les jambes nues, tapant le bois des talons.","Nana had, at that moment, the fantasies of a sentimental girl. She stared at the moon for hours.

Another time, in the bedroom, after a silence, she sobbed into the child's neck, stammering that she was afraid of dying. She often sang in a low voice, a romance by Madame Lerat, full of flowers and birds, tender to tears, interrupting herself to take Georges in an embrace of passion, demanding of him oaths of eternal love. . Finally, she was stupid, as she herself admitted, when the two of them, having become comrades again, smoked cigarettes on the edge of the bed, their bare legs, tapping the wood of their heels.","At this time, Nana indulged in the fancies of a sentimental girl. She would look at the moon for hours. One night, she insisted on going down into the garden with George, when all the household was asleep; and they wandered about under the trees, their arms round each other’s waists, then they lay down on the grass and got thoroughly soaked with the dew. Another time, in the bed-room, after a rather long pause, Nana sobbed on the youngster’s neck, murmuring she was afraid she was going to die. She often sang in a low voice a ballad of Madame Lerat’s, full of flowers and birds, becoming affected even to tears, and interrupting herself to clasp George in a passionate embrace and cause him to utter vows of eternal love. In short, she behaved very foolishly as she herself would often admit, when, becoming comrades again, they both smoked cigarettes seated on the edge of the bedstead, their heels knocking against the wood-work.","Nana in those days was subject to the fancies a sentimental girl will indulge in. She would gaze at the moon for hours. One night she had a mind to go down into the garden with Georges when all the household was asleep. When there they strolled under the trees, their arms round each other's waists, and finally went and laid down in the grass, where the dew soaked them through and through. On another occasion, after a long silence up in the bedroom, she fell sobbing on the lad's neck, declaring in broken accents that she was afraid of dying. She would often croon a favorite ballad of Mme Lerat's, which was full of flowers and birds. The song would melt her to tears, and she would break off in order to clasp Georges in a passionate embrace and to extract from him vows of undying affection. In short she was extremely silly, as she herself would admit when they both became jolly good fellows again and sat up smoking cigarettes on the edge of the bed, dangling their bare legs over it the while and tapping their heels against its wooden side.","She fell into sentimental, childish fancies. She’d watch the moon for hours on end. One night when the house had gone to sleep she decided to go down into the garden with Georges, and they walked about under the trees with their arms round each other’s waists, and lay down in the grass, damp with dew. On another occasion, when they were lying silently in her bedroom, she hid her head in the boy’s neck, sobbing and blubbering that she was afraid of dying. She would often sing under her breath one of Madame Lerat’s sentimental drawing-room ballads, full of birds and flowers, shedding tears of emotion until she broke off to give Georges a passionate hug and made him promise to love her for ever and ever. In a word, she was being stupid, as she herself recognized when, having recovered their calm, they would sit together like two old friends on the edge of the bed, smoking and tapping their heels against its wooden sides."

"Mignon était devenu grave. Ce Steiner qui avait promis un hôtel à Rose, autrefois ! Enfin, il fallait ne se fâcher avec personne, c’était une occasion à retrouver. Pris de rêverie, mais supérieur toujours, Mignon se promenait de la cheminée à la console. Il n’y avait plus que lui et Fauchery dans le foyer. Le journaliste, fatigué, venait de s’allonger au fond du grand fauteuil ; et il restait bien tranquille, les paupières demi-closes, sous les regards que l’autre jetait en passant. Quand ils étaient seuls, Mignon dédaignait de le bourrer de tapes ; à quoi bon ? puisque personne n’aurait joui de la scène. Il se désintéressait trop pour s’amuser de lui-même à ses farces de mari goguenard. Fauchery, heureux de ce répit de quelques minutes, allongeait languissamment les pieds devant le feu, les yeux en l’air, voyageant du baromètre à la pendule. Dans sa marche, Mignon se planta en face du buste de Potier, le regarda sans le voir, puis retourna devant la fenêtre où le trou sombre de la cour se creusait. La pluie avait cessé, un silence profond s’était fait, alourdi encore par la grosse chaleur du coke et le flamboiement des becs de gaz. Plus un bruit ne montait des coulisses. L'escalier et les couloirs semblaient morts. C'était une de ces paix étouffées de fin d’acte, lorsque toute la troupe enlève sur la scène le vacarme assourdissant de quelque finale, tandis que le foyer vide s’endort dans un bourdonnement d’asphyxie.","Mignon had become serious. That Steiner who once promised Rose a hotel! Finally, you had to not get angry with anyone, it was an opportunity to find again. Taken by reverie, but still superior, Mignon walked from the fireplace to the console. Only he and Fauchery were left in the household. The journalist, tired, had just stretched out in the back of the big armchair; and he remained very quiet, his eyelids half-closed, under the glances which the other cast as he passed. When they were alone, Mignon disdained to smack him; what's the point ? since no one would have enjoyed the scene. He was too disinterested to amuse himself with his mocking husband's pranks. Fauchery, happy with this respite of a few minutes, languidly stretched out his feet in front of the fire, his eyes in the air, traveling from the barometer to the clock. As he walked, Mignon planted himself in front of the bust of Potier, looked at it without seeing it, then turned back in front of the window where the dark hole in the courtyard was hollowed out. The rain had stopped, a deep silence had fallen, still heavy with the great heat of the coke and the blazing of the gaslights. No more noise came from behind the scenes. The staircase and hallways looked dead. It was one of those stifled peaces at the end of an act, when the whole troupe takes the deafening din of some finale from the stage, while the empty hearth falls asleep in a hum of asphyxiation.","Mignon became very grave. That Steiner had once promised Rose a mansion! Well, it was of no use quarrelling with anybody; it was an opportunity which he had lost, and which he must regain. Full of thought, but still quite master of himself, Mignon walked up and down from the fire-place to the mirror. There were only he and Fauchery left in the green-room. The journalist, feeling tired, had just stretched himself out in the easy-chair; and he kept very quiet, his eyes half closed, beneath the glances which the other gave him as he passed to and fro. When they were alone, Mignon disdained to pommel him. What would have been the use? as no one would have been there to enjoy the fun. He cared too little about the matter to find any amusement for himself in playing the bantering husband. Fauchery, thankful for this short respite, was languidly stretching his legs out before the fire, as his eyes wandered from the barometer to the clock. Mignon interrupted his walk for a moment, and stood before the bust of Potier, which he looked at without seeing. Then he went and placed himself at the window opening on to the dark court-yard beneath. It had left off raining, and a profound silence had succeeded, whilst the atmosphere had become closer through the heat of the coke fire and the flaring of the gas-jets. Not a sound could be heard from the stage. The staircase and the passages were as still as the tomb. It was the hushed peacefulness occasioned by the end of an act, when all the company are on the stage joining in the deafening uproar of some finale, whilst the empty green-room is under the influence of asphyxia.","Mignon had grown suddenly serious. Oh, that Steiner! He had promised Rose a fine house in the old days! Well, well, it wouldn't do to grow angry with anybody. Here was a position that would have to be won again. From fireplace to console table Mignon paced, sunk in thought yet still unconquered by circumstances. There was no one in the greenroom now save Fauchery and himself. The journalist was tired and had flung himself back into the recesses of the big armchair. There he stayed with half-closed eyes and as quiet as quiet could be, while the other glanced down at him as he passed. When they were alone Mignon scorned to slap him at every turn. What good would it have done, since nobody would have enjoyed the spectacle? He was far too disinterested to be personally entertained by the farcical scenes in which he figured as a bantering husband. Glad of this short-lived respite, Fauchery stretched his feet out languidly toward the fire and let his upturned eyes wander from the barometer to the clock. In the course of his march Mignon planted himself in front of Potier's bust, looked at it without seeming to see it and then turned back to the window, outside which yawned the darkling gulf of the courtyard. The rain had ceased, and there was now a deep silence in the room, which the fierce heat of the coke fire and the flare of the gas jets rendered still more oppressive. Not a sound came from the wings: the staircase and the passages were deadly still. That choking sensation of quiet, which behind the scenes immediately precedes the end of an act, had begun to pervade the empty greenroom. Indeed, the place seemed to be drowsing off through very breathlessness amid that faint murmur which the stage gives forth when the whole troupe are raising the deafening uproar of some grand finale.","Mignon was looking stern: earlier on, that man Steiner had been promising Rose a town-house! Ah well, he mustn’t quarrel with anyone, it’d be a possibility to look into later on. Pacing to and fro between the fireplace and the pier-table, in full control of the situation as always, Mignon was pondering. He and Fauchery were now alone in the green room. The tired journalist was stretched out quietly in the big armchair, with eyes half-closed; the other man was looking at him as he went by. When they were by themselves Mignon didn’t bother about thumping him; what was the point when there was no one to enjoy the scene? He wasn’t sufficiently interested to find his mischievous tomfoolery funny himself. Grateful for the few minutes’ respite, Fauchery had drowsily stretched his feet out towards the fire and was letting his gaze wander idly from the barometer to the clock. Mignon interrupted his walk to stop in front of the bust of Potier, stared at it without seeing it, and then went back to the window facing out on to the gloomy depths of the courtyard. It had stopped raining and the stillness was made even more oppressive by the stifling heat from the coke fire and the flaring gas-jets. Backstage not a sound was to be heard; the staircase and the corridors were as silent as the grave. It was the sort of muffled peace you have at the end of an act, when the whole cast is on stage bringing off some deafening finale while the abandoned green room goes to sleep in a low, asphyxiating murmur."
"« Tout à l’heure, nous verrons ça. »","“Presently, we will see that. »","For a few seconds she looked him straight in the face, and then replied, “We’ll talk it over by-and-by.”","""We'll see about that all in good time.""",‘Let’s talk about it a bit later.’

"« Finis donc, les sergents de ville ! murmura-t-elle d’une voix changée. Rentrons vite, mon chat. »","“End then, the sergeants of town! she whispered in a changed voice. Let's go home quickly, my cat. »","Then as Satin whistled again, amused at the old hag who could not see her, she murmured in an altered tone of voice, “Leave off—the police again! Let’s go away, quick, my darling.”","""Do leave off; there are the police! "" she murmured in changed tones. ""In with us, quick, my pet!""","Then, as Satin gave another whistle, still laughing at the old woman who couldn’t see her: ‘Please stop doing that’, Nana said in an undertone, with a change of tone. ‘Here come the police again. Let’s go back in, my pet.’"
"D’ailleurs, la conversation sur les enfants continuait. La Faloise, empli de trouble par le voisinage de Gaga, lui demandait des nouvelles de sa fille, qu’il avait eu le plaisir d’apercevoir avec elle aux Variétés. Lili se portait bien, mais elle était encore si gamine ! Il resta surpris en apprenant que Lili entrait dans sa dix-neuvième année. Gaga devint à ses yeux plus imposante. Et, comme il cherchait à savoir pourquoi elle n’avait pas amené Lili :","Besides, the conversation about children continued. La Faloise, filled with confusion by Gaga's neighborhood, asked him for news of his daughter, whom he had had the pleasure of seeing with her at Variétés.

And, as he was trying to find out why she hadn't brought Lili:","The conversation about children, however, continued. La Faloise, rendered quite bashful by Gaga’s proximity, began to ask her for news of her daughter, whom he had had the pleasure of seeing with her at the Variety Theatre.

And as he tried to find out why she had not brought Lili with her—","Elsewhere the conversation about children continued.

Gaga became even more imposing in his eyes, and when he endeavored to find out why she had not brought Lili with her:","Meanwhile the topic of children was still being pursued. Greatly excited by sitting so close to Gaga, la Faloise was enquiring after her daughter, whom he’d had the pleasure of seeing at the Variétés with her. Lili was well but still such a little monkey!

"Alors, ces dames discutèrent. Mais leurs voix demeuraient discrètes, de légers rires par moments coupaient la gravité de la conversation. Les deux lampes de la cheminée, recouvertes d’une dentelle rose, les éclairaient faiblement ; et il n’y avait, sur des meubles éloignés, que trois autres lampes, qui laissaient le vaste salon dans une ombre douce.","So these ladies chatted. But their voices remained discreet, light laughter at times cutting the gravity of the conversation. The two lamps in the fireplace, covered with pink lace, gave them a dim light; and there were only three other lamps on distant furniture, which left the vast drawing-room in soft shadow.","Then the ladies entered into a long discussion on the subject. But their voices were subdued, and only occasionally did a faint laugh interrupt the solemnity of the conversation. The two lamps on the mantlepiece, covered with rose-coloured shades, shed but a feeble light over them; and there being only three other lamps, which were placed at a distance on different pieces of furniture, the vast room was in a pleasant shadow.","Then the ladies fell into a discussion. But their voices were discreetly attuned, while light trills of laughter now and again interrupted the gravity of their talk. The two lamps on the chimney piece, which had shades of rose-colored lace, cast a feeble light over them while on scattered pieces of furniture there burned but three other lamps, so that the great drawing room remained in soft shadow.","The ladies launched into a discussion, keeping their voices down, though the earnestness of their conversation was broken now and then by quiet laughter. Under their pink lace shades, the two lamps on the mantelshelf were casting a very subdued light, and since there were only three other lamps, placed some distance away, the huge drawing-room was shrouded in gentle shadow."
"« Oh ! c’est Labordette », murmura-t-il d’une voix insouciante, comme si la présence de ce monsieur devait être pour tout le monde naturelle et sans conséquence.",""" Oh ! it’s Labordette,” he murmured in a carefree voice, as if the presence of this gentleman should be natural and inconsequential to everyone.","“Oh! it’s only Labordette,” he murmured in a careless tone of voice, as if the presence of that gentleman was the most natural as well as the most unimportant thing in the world.","But he turned round again directly. ""Oh, it's Labordette,"" he muttered in a careless voice, as though that gentle man's presence ought to strike all the world as though both natural and immaterial.","‘Oh, it’s Labordette’, he said offhandedly, as if everyone would consider it natural and of no importance for that man to be there."
"Alors, elle ne s’attarda pas à discuter. De ses petites mains, elle lui renversa la tête, puis, se penchant, colla sa bouche sur sa bouche, dans un long baiser. Un frisson le secoua, il tressaillit sous elle, éperdu, les yeux clos. Et elle le mit debout.","So she didn't bother to argue. With her small hands, she threw his head back, then, leaning down, pressed her mouth to his mouth, in a long kiss. A shiver shook him, he quivered under her, bewildered, his eyes closed. And she stood him up.","So she did not waste any more time in arguing. With her little hands she bent back his head; then stooping forward, she pressed her lips to his in one long embrace. A thrill passed through his frame. He started beneath her; his eyes were closed, his reason gone. And she raised him from his seat.","Oh, I beg you not to insist on that!"" Thereupon she wasted no more time in discussion but took his head between her small hands, pushed it back a little, bent down and glued her mouth to his in a long, long kiss. He shivered violently; he trembled beneath her touch; his eyes were closed, and he was beside himself. She lifted him to his feet.","She wasted no time in arguing. Seizing his head between her two little hands, she tipped it back, bent forward, and pressing her lips against his, gave him a long, deep kiss.

"« Oh ! le mignon, qu’il est gentil en petite femme ! » Il avait simplement passé une grande chemise de nuit à entre-deux, un pantalon brodé et le peignoir, un long peignoir de batiste, garni de dentelles. Là-dedans, il semblait une fille5, avec ses deux bras nus de jeune blond, avec ses cheveux fauves encore mouillés, qui roulaient dans son cou.",""" Oh ! the cute, how nice he is as a little woman!

"Cependant, Nana, en roulant ces choses, était arrivée chez elle, rue Véron. Elle fut toute secouée de voir de la lumière.

Alors, il resta digne, il lui tendit une lettre à son adresse, qu’il avait tranquillement décachetée. C’était une lettre de Georges, toujours enfermé aux Fondettes, se soulageant chaque semaine dans des pages brûlantes. Nana adorait qu’on lui écrivît, surtout de grandes phrases d’amour, avec des serments. Elle lisait ça à tout le monde. Fontan connaissait le style de Georges et l’appréciait. Mais ce soir-là, elle redoutait tellement une scène, qu’elle affecta l’indifférence ; elle parcourut la lettre d’un air maussade, et la rejeta aussitôt. Fontan s’était mis à battre la retraite 39 sur une vitre, ennuyé de se coucher de si bonne heure, ne sachant plus à quoi occuper sa soirée. Brusquement, il se tourna.","However, Nana, while rolling these things, had arrived at her house, rue Véron. She was quite shaken to see light. Fontan returned sullen, also abandoned by the friend who had bought him dinner. He listened with a cold air to the explanations she gave, fearing the skullcaps, terrified to find him there, when she did not expect him before one o'clock in the morning; she was lying, she confessed to having spent six francs, but with Madame Maloir. So he remained dignified, he handed her a letter addressed to her, which he had quietly opened. It was a letter from Georges, still locked up in the Fondettes, relieving himself every week in burning pages. Nana adored having people write to her, especially long phrases of love, with oaths. She read that to everyone. Fontan knew Georges' style and appreciated it. But that evening she was so dreading a scene that she affected indifference; she skimmed the letter sullenly, and immediately threw it away. Fontan had begun to beat the retreat 39 on a window, annoyed at going to bed so early, not knowing what to do with his evening. Suddenly he turned.","However, Nana, while thinking of all these things, had at length arrived home in the Rue Véron. She was amazed to see a light in the windows. Fontan, having been left directly after dinner by the friend who had invited him, had come home in a very bad humour. He listened in a cold way to the explanations she hastened to give in her fear of being knocked about and her bewilderment at seeing him there when she had not expected him before one in the morning; she lied, for though she admitted spending six francs , she said she had been with Madame Maloir. He remained wrapt in his dignity, and handed her a letter, which he had coolly opened although addressed to her. It was a letter from George, who was still kept at Les Fondettes, and who gave vent to his feelings every week in several pages of the most impassioned language. Nana was delighted when anyone wrote to her, expecially letters full of vows of love. She read them to everyone. Fontan was acquainted with George’s style, and appreciated it. But that night she so feared a row that she affected the greatest indifference; she glanced through the letter in a sulky sort of way, and then threw it on one side. Fontan was beating the tattoo on a window pane, not wanting to go to bed so early, and not knowing what to do to while away the evening. Suddenly he turned round.","Revolving these matters, Nana at length reached her home in the Rue Veron and was taken aback on observing a light in the window. Fontan had come home in a sulk, for he, too, had been deserted by the friend who had been dining with him. He listened coldly to her explanations while she trembled lest he should strike her. It scared her to find him at home, seeing that she had not expected him before one in the morning, and she told him a fib and confessed that she had certainly spent six francs, but in Mme Maloir's society. He was not ruffled, however, and he handed her a letter which, though addressed to her, he had quietly opened. It was a letter from Georges, who was still a prisoner at Les Fondettes and comforted himself weekly with the composition of glowing pages. Nana loved to be written to, especially when the letters were full of grand, loverlike expressions with a sprinkling of vows. She used to read them to everybody. Fontan was familiar with the style employed by Georges and appreciated it. But that evening she was so afraid of a scene that she affected complete indifference, skimming through the letter with a sulky expression and flinging it aside as soon as read. Fontan had begun beating a tattoo on a windowpane; the thought of going to bed so early bored him, and yet he did not know how to employ his evening. He turned briskly round:","While turning these thoughts over in her mind, Nana had arrived at the Rue Véron and was shaken to see a light on in the flat. Fontan had also been left to his own devices by the friend who’d paid for his dinner, and he was in a foul mood. He listened frigidly to Nana’s explanations. Taken by surprise at finding him home so early and afraid of getting her face slapped, Nana lied about her evening, admitting she’d spent six francs but saying she’d been with Madame Maloir. Still unbending, Fontan handed her a letter addressed to her which he’d unblushingly opened himself. It was a letter from Georges, still shut away in Les Fondettes and letting off steam by writing passionate letters to Nana. She adored getting letters, especially when they were full of grand expressions of love, complete with solemn vows. She used to read them out loud to everybody. Fontan knew Georges’s style and admired it; but that night she was so afraid of a row that she pretended to be unconcerned, skipping rapidly through it and immediately discarding it. Fontan was drumming on the window, bored at having to go to bed so early and not knowing how to spend the evening. He suddenly swung round:"

"Un silence s’était fait, quelques secondes solennelles passèrent sous le haut plafond. Deux jeunes gens chuchotaient, mais ils se turent à leur tour ; et l’on n’entendit plus que le pas étouffé du comte Muffat, qui traversait la pièce. Les lampes semblaient avoir pâli, le feu s’éteignait, une ombre sévère noyait les vieux amis de la maison dans les fauteuils qu’ils occupaient là depuis quarante ans. Ce fut comme si, entre deux phrases échangées, les invités eussent senti venir la mère du comte, avec son grand air glacial. Déjà la comtesse Sabine reprenait :","A silence fell, a few solemn seconds passed under the high ceiling. Two young people were whispering, but they too were silent; and all that was heard was the muffled step of Count Muffat, who crossed the room. The lamps seemed to have faded, the fire was going out, a severe shadow drowned the old friends of the house in the armchairs they had occupied there for forty years. It was as if, between two exchanged sentences, the guests had felt the Count's mother approaching, with her great icy air. Already the Countess Sabine resumed:","The conversation ceased, and a rather solemn interval succeeded. Two young men were whispering, but they soon left off, and nothing was heard but Count Muffat’s faint footsteps as he walked across the room. The lamps seemed to be burning low, the fire was going out, and a deep shadow almost hid from sight the old friends of the family, as they sat in the chairs they had occupied there for forty years past. It was as though, between a couple of sentences, the guests had felt the count’s mother return with her grand, icy cold look. Countess Sabine, however, soon resumed:","There was a pause in the talk, and some solemn moments passed silently by in the lofty room. Two young men were whispering, but they ceased in their turn, and the hushed step of Count Muffat was alone audible as he crossed the floor. The lamps seemed to have paled; the fire was going out; a stern shadow fell athwart the old friends of the house where they sat in the chairs they had occupied there for forty years back. It was as though in a momentary pause of conversation the invited guests had become suddenly aware that the count's mother, in all her glacial stateliness, had returned among them. But the Countess Sabine had once more resumed:","There was a sudden pause in the conversation, and for a few seconds time moved solemnly across the lofty ceiling. Two young men who’d been whispering became silent too, and the only sound was the muffled steps of Count Muffat crossing the room. The lamps seemed to have dimmed, the fire was dying down, the old family friends, ensconced in the armchairs which they’d occupied for the last forty years, were swallowed up in an austere shadow. It was as if, while they were talking, the guests had sensed the count’s mother and her icy, haughty manner returning to haunt them. Countess Sabine broke the silence."

"Alors, pendant quelques minutes, on n’entendit plus que la récitation confuse des acteurs. Ils indiquaient à peine les gestes. Ils gardaient une voix blanche pour ne pas se fatiguer. Cependant, lorsqu’ils marquaient une intention, ils adressaient des coups d’œil à la salle. C'était, devant eux, un trou béant où flottait une ombre vague, comme une fine poussière enfermée dans un haut grenier sans fenêtre. La salle éteinte, éclairée seulement par le demi-jour de la scène, avait un sommeil, un effacement mélancolique et troublant. Au plafond, une nuit opaque noyait les peintures. Du haut en bas des avant-scènes, à droite et à gauche, tombaient d’immenses lés 14 de toile grise, pour protéger les tentures ; et les housses continuaient, des bandes de toile étaient jetées sur le velours des rampes, ceignant les galeries d’un double linceul, salissant les ténèbres de leur ton blafard. On ne distinguait, dans la décoloration générale, que les enfoncements plus sombres des loges qui dessinaient la carcasse des étages, avec les taches des fauteuils, dont le velours rouge tournait au noir. Le lustre, complètement descendu, emplissait l’orchestre de ses pendeloques, faisait songer à un déménagement, à un départ du public pour un voyage dont il ne reviendrait pas15.","Then, for a few minutes, nothing was heard but the confused recitation of the actors. They barely indicated the gestures. They kept a blank voice so as not to get tired. However, when they marked an intention, they cast glances at the room. Ahead of them was a gaping hole in which floated a vague shadow, like fine dust enclosed in a high, windowless attic. The dark room, lit only by the half-light of the stage, had a sleepiness, a melancholy and disturbing effacement. On the ceiling, an opaque night drowned out the paintings. From top to bottom of the proscenium, to right and left, fell immense strips of gray canvas to protect the hangings; and the covers continued, strips of canvas were thrown over the velvet of the banisters, encircling the galleries with a double shroud, sullying the darkness with their pale tone. In the general discoloration one could only make out the darker recesses of the boxes which outlined the carcass of the floors, with the stains of the armchairs, whose red velvet was turning black. The chandelier, completely lowered, filled the orchestra with its pendants, making one think of a move, of the audience leaving for a trip from which they would never return.","Then for a few minutes nothing was heard but the confused voices of the actors. They scarcely indicated the gestures, and spoke in a quiet voice so as not to tire themselves. However, when they intended to score a point, they glanced at the auditorium. It appeared to them like an enormous hole in which floated a vague shadow, similar to a fine dust confined in a big loft without windows. The house, which was in darkness except for the feeble light transmitted from the stage, seemed wrapped in a troubled and melancholy sleep. The paintings on the ceiling were veiled in obscurity. From the top to the bottom of the stage-boxes, on the right and left, hung immense breadths of coarse grey linen to protect the hangings; and strips of the same material were thrown over the velvet of the balustrades, girdling the balconies with a double winding-sheet, staining, as it were, the gloom with their pale tint. In the general discolouration one could only distinguish the darker recesses of the boxes, which indicated the different storeys, and the breaks caused by the seats, the red velvet of which had a blackish look. The great crystal gasalier, lowered almost to the ground, filled the stalls with its pendants, and gave one the idea of a removal, of a departure of the public on a journey from which it would never return.","Then for a minute or so a confused murmur alone was audible as the actors went on repeating their parts. There was scarcely any appropriate action, and they spoke in even tones so as not to tire themselves. Nevertheless, when they did emphasize a particular shade of meaning they cast a glance at the house, which lay before them like a yawning gulf. It was suffused with vague, ambient shadow, which resembled the fine dust floating pent in some high, windowless loft. The deserted house, whose sole illumination was the twilight radiance of the stage, seemed to slumber in melancholy and mysterious effacement. Near the ceiling dense night smothered the frescoes, while from the several tiers of stage boxes on either hand huge widths of gray canvas stretched down to protect the neighboring hangings. In fact, there was no end to these coverings; bands of canvas had been thrown over the velvet-covered ledges in front of the various galleries which they shrouded thickly. Their pale hue stained the surrounding shadows, and of the general decorations of the house only the dark recesses of the boxes were distinguishable. These served to outline the framework of the several stories, where the seats were so many stains of red velvet turned black. The chandelier had been let down as far as it would go, and it so filled the region of the stalls with its pendants as to suggest a flitting and to set one thinking that the public had started on a journey from which they would never return.","For a few minutes there was nothing to be heard but the confused murmur of the actors speaking their lines. They were scarcely bothering to make any gestures, but when they wanted to make a special point they would throw a sudden glance into the auditorium which opened up in front of them, a gaping hole of vague shadows, like a tall, window-less hay-loft full of fine dust. The body of the theatre was gloomy, lit only by the half-light from the stage: it seemed sunk in an alarming, dreary slumber. The ceiling paintings were in complete darkness. Hanging down over the stage boxes on both sides were enormous grey canvas strips to protect the curtains, and there were further covers all round the edge of the velvet-covered handrails of the balconies, a sort of double shroud matching the overall gloom. In this pervading ghostly light, the only things which stood out were the darker recesses of the boxes picking out the carcass of each floor-level, while their plush armchairs showed up as red patches, veering towards black. The chandelier had been completely lowered, filling the orchestra stalls with its crystals, leaving the impression of someone moving house, as if the public was going away on a trip and not intending to come back."

"Cette exécution la calma. Elle se montra tout de suite très douce, très aimable. Le dessert fut charmant, ces messieurs s’égayaient à se servir eux-mêmes. Mais Satin, qui avait pelé une poire, était venue la manger derrière sa chérie, appuyée à ses épaules, lui disant dans le cou des choses, dont elles riaient très fort ; puis, elle voulut partager son dernier morceau de poire, elle le lui présenta entre les dents ; et toutes deux se mordillaient les lèvres, achevaient le fruit dans un baiser. Alors, ce fut une protestation comique de la part de ces messieurs. Philippe leur cria de ne pas se gêner. Vandeuvres demanda s’il fallait sortir. Georges était venu prendre Satin par la taille et l’avait ramenée à sa place.","This execution calmed her. She was immediately very gentle, very kind. The dessert was charming, these gentlemen enjoyed helping themselves. But Satin, who had peeled a pear, had come to eat it behind her darling, leaning on her shoulders, whispering things into her neck, at which they laughed heartily; then, she wanted to share her last piece of pear, she presented it between her teeth; and both bit their lips, finishing the fruit in a kiss. So it was a comical protest from these gentlemen. Philippe shouted at them not to get in the way. Vandeuvres asked if he should go out. Georges had come to take Satin by the waist and brought her back to her place.","This execution calmed her. She at once became very quiet and very amiable. The dessert passed off most pleasantly; and gentlemen were greatly amused at having to help themselves. But Satin, who had peeled a pear, went to eat it standing up behind her darling, leaning against her shoulders, and whispering things in her ear which made them both laugh very much; then she wished to share her last piece of pear, and held it out to Nana between her teeth, and their lips touched as they finished the fruit in a kiss. This produced a comical protest from the gentlemen. Philippe called to them not to stand on ceremony. Vandeuvres asked if they would like him to leave the room. George went and took hold of Satin round the waist and led her back to her seat.","This summary procedure calmed her down, and she was forthwith all sweetness and amiability. The dessert proved charming, and the gentlemen grew quite merry waiting on themselves. But Satin, having peeled a pear, came and ate it behind her darling, leaning on her shoulder the while and whispering sundry little remarks in her ear, at which they both laughed very loudly. By and by she wanted to share her last piece of pear with Nana and presented it to her between her teeth. Whereupon there was a great nibbling of lips, and the pear was finished amid kisses. At this there was a burst of comic protest from the gentlemen, Philippe shouting to them to take it easy and Vandeuvres asking if one ought to leave the room. Georges, meanwhile, had come and put his arm round Satin's waist and had brought her back to her seat.","Bullying them calmed her down, and she immediately became very amiable and gentle. Dessert was charming. The men enjoyed having to serve themselves. But Satin peeled a pear and came over to her darling and leaned over her shoulder from behind to eat it, whispering things into her ear which set them both laughing very loudly. Then she wanted to share her last piece of pear with Nana by offering it in her teeth, so that they were both nibbling each other’s lips. They finished off the pear with a kiss. The gentlemen made a show of protesting, jokingly; Philippe said not to mind them, just go ahead; Vandeuvres asked if the men ought to leave the room.

"D’abord, Nana mit le comte sur un bon pied. Elle établit nettement le programme de leurs relations. Lui, donnait douze mille francs par mois, sans compter les cadeaux, et ne demandait en retour qu’une fidélité absolue. Elle, jura la fidélité. Mais elle exigea des égards, une liberté entière de maîtresse de maison, un respect complet de ses volontés. Ainsi, elle recevrait tous les jours ses amis ; il viendrait seulement à des heures réglées ; enfin, sur toutes choses, il aurait une foi aveugle en elle. Et, quand il hésitait, pris d’une inquiétude jalouse, elle faisait de la dignité, en menaçant de lui tout rendre, ou bien elle jurait sur la tête du petit Louis. Ça devait suffire. Il n’y avait pas d’amour où il n’y avait pas d’estime. Au bout du premier mois, Muffat la respectait.","First, Nana put the count on a good footing. It clearly establishes the program of their relations. He gave twelve thousand francs a month, not counting the gifts, and asked in return only absolute fidelity. She swore loyalty. But she demanded consideration, complete freedom as mistress of the house, complete respect for her wishes. Thus, she would receive her friends every day; he would only come at regular hours; finally, on all things, he would have blind faith in her. And when he hesitated, seized with jealous uneasiness, she showed dignity by threatening to give him everything back, or else she would swear on little Louis's head. That had to be enough. There was no love where there was no esteem. After the first month, Muffat respected her.","Nana commenced by putting the count on a satisfactory footing. She settled clearly the programme of their relations. He gave twelve thousand francs a month, without counting presents, and only asked in return an absolute fidelity. She swore to be faithful; but she insisted on being treated with deference, on enjoying entire liberty as mistress of the household, and on having all her wishes respected. For instance, she would receive her friends every day; he himself should only come at stated hours—in short, he should trust her implicitly in everything. And when he hesitated, seized by a jealous anxiety, she became very dignified, threatening to return him everything, or else swearing fidelity on the head of her little Louis. That ought to be sufficient. There could be no love where there was no esteem. At the end of the first month, Muffat respected her.","At starting Nana put the count on a proper footing and clearly mapped out the conditions of their relationship. The count gave twelve thousand francs monthly, presents excepted, and demanded nothing in return save absolute fidelity. She swore fidelity but insisted also on being treated with the utmost consideration, on enjoying complete liberty as mistress of the house and on having her every wish respected. For instance, she was to receive her friends every day, and he was to come only at stated times. In a word, he was to repose a blind confidence in her in everything. And when he was seized with jealous anxiety and hesitated to grant what she wanted, she stood on her dignity and threatened to give him back all he had given or even swore by little Louiset to perform what she promised. This was to suffice him. There was no love where mutual esteem was wanting. At the end of the first month Muffat respected her.","The first thing Nana did was to tell the count where he stood and lay down a clear programme for their relationship. He was to provide twelve hundred francs a month, apart from presents, and in return could expect her to be completely faithful, which she promised to be. But she demanded to be shown every consideration, absolute control in her own house, and complete compliance with her wishes. So she would have her friends to call every day; he would come only at fixed times; in a word, he would have to show blind trust in her at all times. And when he seemed hesitant, troubled by jealousy, she got on her high horse and either threatened to hand back everything or else gave her solemn word of honour, on the head of her little son Louiset. That ought to satisfy him! There couldn’t be love without respect; and by the end of the first month Muffat did respect her."
"Une queue dans l’escalier ! Francis lui-même, malgré le flegme anglais qu’il affectait, se mit à rire, tout en rangeant les peignes.

Francis himself, despite the English stolidity of manner which he was wont to affect, began laughing as he put up his combs.

"En scène, Rose détaillait si finement une phrase de son duo, que des bravos couvrirent l’orchestre. Nana se tut, la face sérieuse. Cependant, le comte se risquait dans une rue45, lorsque Barillot l’arrêta, en l’avertissant qu’il y avait là une découverte46. Il voyait le décor à l’envers et de biais, le derrière des châssis consolidés par une épaisse couche de vieilles affiches, puis un coin de la scène, la caverne de l’Etna creusée dans une mine d’argent, avec la forge de Vulcain, au fond. Les herses descendues incendiaient le paillon appliqué à larges coups de pinceau. Des portants à verres bleus et à verres rouges, par une opposition calculée, ménageaient un flamboiement de brasier ; tandis que, par terre, au troisième plan, des traînées de gaz couraient, pour détacher une barre de roches noires. Et là, sur un praticable 47 incliné en pente douce, au milieu de ces gouttes de lumière pareilles à des lampions posés dans l’herbe, un soir de fête publique, la vieille madame Drouard, qui jouait Junon, était assise, aveuglée et somnolente, attendant son entrée.","On stage, Rose detailed a phrase from her duet so finely that cheers swept through the orchestra. Nana fell silent, her face serious. However, the count was venturing into a street45 when Barillot stopped him, warning him that there was a discovery there46. He saw the set upside down and at an angle, the back of the frames consolidated by a thick layer of old posters, then a corner of the stage, the Etna cave dug in a silver mine, with the forge of Vulcan, in the background. The lowered portcullis set fire to the paillon applied with broad strokes of the brush. Racks with blue glasses and red glasses, by a calculated opposition, provided a blaze of fire; while, on the ground, in the third plane, trails of gas ran to detach a bar of black rocks. And there, on a platform 47 gently sloping, in the middle of these drops of light like lanterns placed in the grass, one evening of public celebration, old Madame Drouard, who played Juno, was seated, blind and drowsy. , waiting for his entrance.","On the stage, Rose had thrown so much expression into a phrase of her duo that the applause quite drowned the music. Nana left off talking, and looked very serious. On the count advancing too far along one of the wings, Barillot stopped him, saying that he might be seen. He caught sight of the reverse of the side-scenes slantwise, with the backs of the frames consolidated by a thick layer of old posters, and a portion of the further drop, representing the silver cavern of Mount Etna, with Vulcan’s forge in the background. The floats that had been lowered cast a glare of light on the daubs of metallic paint representing the silver. Some red and blue glass judiciously intermingled imitated the flames of a furnace; whilst midway up the stage a number of flaring gas-jets running along the floor lit up a row of black rocks. And behind these, reclining on a gently sloping boulder, surrounded by all the lights, which looked like so many Chinese lanterns among the grass on a day of illuminations, old Madame Drouard who played Juno, and was half blinded by the glitter, drowsily awaited the moment to make her appearance.","On the stage Rose rendered a phrase in her duet so cleverly that the stalls burst into universal applause. Nana was silent at this, and her face grew grave. Meanwhile the count was venturing down a passage when Barillot stopped him and said he would make a discovery there. Indeed, he obtained an oblique back view of the scenery and of the wings which had been strengthened, as it were, by a thick layer of old posters. Then he caught sight of a corner of the stage, of the Etna cave hollowed out in a silver mine and of Vulcan's forge in the background. Battens, lowered from above, lit up a sparkling substance which had been laid on with large dabs of the brush. Side lights with red glasses and blue were so placed as to produce the appearance of a fiery brazier, while on the floor of the stage, in the far background, long lines of gaslight had been laid down in order to throw a wall of dark rocks into sharp relief. Hard by on a gentle, ""practicable"" incline, amid little points of light resembling the illumination lamps scattered about in the grass on the night of a public holiday, old Mme Drouard, who played Juno, was sitting dazed and sleepy, waiting for her cue.","On stage Rose was singing a line of her duet with such sensitive phrasing that the applause was drowning the orchestra. Nana stopped talking, and her eyes took on a flinty look. Meanwhile, as the count was venturing into one of the slips, Barillot stopped him, explaining that it opened on to the stage. He could see the set from the rear and the side, the backs of the flats plastered together with a thick layer of old posters, and then a corner of the stage, the cave on Mount Etna hollowed out as a silver mine with Vulcan’s forge at the back. The stage-lights had been let down and were making the large coloured spangles glitter. Bits of blue and red glass were fixed to frames to create the effect of a glowing fire, and on the floor in the background there were rows of gas-jets picking out a line of black rocks. And here, sitting half asleep on a gently sloping practicable,* blinded by all these lights which looked like lanterns placed in the grass for a public holiday, was old Madame Drouard who took the part of Juno, waiting for her cue."

"Steiner s’ennuyait. Il racontait à Fauchery une aventure de cette petite dame de Chezelles, qu’il appelait Léonide tout court ; une bougresse30, disait-il en baissant la voix, derrière les fauteuils des dames. Fauchery la regardait, dans sa grande robe de satin bleu pâle, drôlement posée sur un coin de son fauteuil, mince et hardie comme un garçon, et il finissait par être surpris de la voir là ; on se tenait mieux chez Caroline Héquet, dont la mère avait sérieusement monté la maison. C’était tout un sujet d’article. Quel singulier monde que ce monde parisien ! Les salons les plus rigides se trouvaient envahis. Évidemment, ce silencieux Théophile Venot, qui se contentait de sourire en montrant ses dents mauvaises, devait être un legs 31 de la défunte comtesse, ainsi que les dames d’âge mûr, madame Chantereau, madame Du Joncquoy, et quatre ou cinq vieillards, immobiles dans les angles. Le comte Muffat amenait des fonctionnaires ayant cette correction de tenue qu’on aimait chez les hommes aux Tuileries ; entre autres, le chef de bureau, toujours seul au milieu de la pièce, la face rasée et les regards éteints, sanglé dans son habit, au point de ne pouvoir risquer un geste. Presque tous les jeunes gens et quelques personnages de hautes manières venaient du marquis de Chouard, qui avait gardé des relations suivies dans le parti légitimiste32, après s’être rallié en entrant au Conseil d’État. Restaient Léonide de Chezelles, Steiner, tout un coin louche, sur lequel madame Hugon tranchait avec sa sérénité de vieille femme aimable. Et Fauchery, qui voyait son article, appelait ça le coin de la comtesse Sabine.","Steiner was bored. He was telling Fauchery about an adventure of this little lady from Chezelles, whom he called Leonide for short; a matron,30 he would say, lowering his voice, behind the ladies' armchairs. Fauchery looked at her, in her big pale blue satin dress, oddly posed on the corner of her armchair, thin and bold as a boy, and he ended by being surprised to see her there; We behaved better at Caroline Héquet, whose mother had seriously set up the house. It was quite the subject of an article. What a singular world this Parisian world is! The most rigid salons were invaded. Obviously, this silent Théophile Venot, who contented himself with smiling while showing his bad teeth, must have been a legacy 31 of the late Countess, as well as the ladies of mature age, Madame Chantereau, Madame Du Joncquoy, and four or five old men, stationary in the corners. Count Muffat brought functionaries with that correct deportment which was so popular among men at the Tuileries; among others, the office manager, still alone in the middle of the room, his face shaved and his eyes blank, strapped in his coat to the point of not being able to risk a gesture. Almost all the young people and a few high-mannered people came from the Marquis de Chouard, who had kept close connections in the legitimist party32, after having joined on entering the Council of State. There remained Léonide de Chezelles, Steiner, a whole shady corner, on which Madame Hugon cut through with the serenity of an amiable old woman. And Fauchery, who saw his article, called it Countess Sabine's corner.","Steiner began to feel bored. He related to Fauchery an adventure of that little Madame de Chezelles, whom he familiarly called Léonide. A regular hussy, said he, as he lowered his voice behind the ladies’ chairs. Fauchery watched her in her dress of pale blue satin, as she sat on a corner of her chair, looking as slim and as impudent as a boy, and he ended by feeling surprised at seeing her there. They knew better how to behave themselves at Caroline Héquet’s, whose establishment had just been placed on a substantial footing by her mother. It was quite a subject for an article. What an extraordinary world was the Parisian one! The strictest drawing-rooms were becoming invaded. That silent Théophile Venot, who contented himself with smiling and showing his bad teeth, was evidently a bequest of the defunct countess, just the same as the elderly ladies, Madame Chantereau, Madame du Joncquoy, and four or five old gentlemen who remained immovable in their corners. Count Muffat brought some government officials, who affected that correctness of bearing which was the fashion of the Tuileries.ab Amongst others, the head of the department remained seated by himself in the middle of the room, with his clean shaven face and dull-looking eyes, and so tightly buttoned up in his coat that he seemed as though he dare not move. Nearly all the young men, and some persons of lofty style, had been introduced by the Marquis de Chouard, who had kept up his connection with the legitimists, after having joined the Empire and become a member of the Council of State. There remained Léonide de Chezelles, Steiner, a most ambiguous lot, which was relieved by Madame Hugon with the serenity of an amiable old woman; and Fauchery, who still had his article in his mind, called them Countess Sabine’s set.","Steiner was getting bored. He was describing to Fauchery an escapade of that little Mme de Chezelles, whom he simply referred to as Leonide. "" A blackguard woman,"" he said, lowering his voice behind the ladies' armchairs. Fauchery looked at her as she sat quaintly perched, in her voluminous ball dress of pale blue satin, on the corner of her armchair. She looked as slight and impudent as a boy, and he ended by feeling astonished at seeing her there. People comported themselves better at Caroline Hequet's, whose mother had arranged her house on serious principles. Here was a perfect subject for an article. What a strange world was this world of Paris! The most rigid circles found themselves invaded. Evidently that silent Theophile Venot, who contented himself by smiling and showing his ugly teeth, must have been a legacy from the late countess. So, too, must have been such ladies of mature age as Mme Chantereau and Mme du Joncquoy, besides four or five old gentlemen who sat motionless in corners. The Count Muffat attracted to the house a series of functionaries, distinguished by the immaculate personal appearance which was at that time required of the men at the Tuileries. Among others there was the chief clerk, who still sat solitary in the middle of the room with his closely shorn cheeks, his vacant glance and his coat so tight of fit that he could scarce venture to move. Almost all the young men and certain individuals with distinguished, aristocratic manners were the Marquis de Chouard's contribution to the circle, he having kept touch with the Legitimist party after making his peace with the empire on his entrance into the Council of State. There remained Leonide de Chezelles and Steiner, an ugly little knot against which Mme Hugon's elderly and amiable serenity stood out in strange contrast. And Fauchery, having sketched out his article, named this last group ""Countess Sabine's little clique.""","Steiner was feeling bored. He was telling Fauchery about an affair of that little Madame de Chezelles, whom he referred to simply as Léonide; a hard-boiled bitch, he said, lowering his voice, for they were standing behind the ladies’ chairs. Fauchery looked towards her, oddly perched on a corner of her chair, in her long pale blue satin dress, as slim and bold as any boy and he found himself feeling surprised at seeing her there: guests were better behaved at Caroline Héquet’s, where her mother had set her up impeccably. There was the subject for a whole article there. What a strange world this Parisian society was! The most strait-laced drawing-rooms were being invaded. The silent Théophile Venot, who did nothing but smile and show his bad teeth, must have been a relic from the old countess, like the elderly ladies Madame Chantereau and Madame Du Joncquoy, and four or five aged gentlemen sitting in frozen attitudes in odd corners. Count Muffat would bring along those senior officials who displayed the propriety deemed desirable by the Imperial court; these must include the clean-shaven and dead-eyed head of department, still sitting in splendid isolation in the middle of the room, so tightly buttoned into his tailcoat that he didn’t dare move. Most of the young men, and a few upper-crust dignitaries, had been introduced by the Marquis de Chouard, who had maintained close contacts with the Legitimists* after he had made his peace with the Second Empire on joining the Conseil d’État. That left Léonide de Chezelles, Steiner, and a whole shady element in stark contrast to that serene and kindly old lady, Madame Hugon. Fauchery, who was already composing his article, decided to call it the ‘Countess Sabine element’."

"Et il l’emportait, et il le secouait, avant de le remettre par terre. Devant les rires exagérés des machinistes, Fauchery devint pâle ; ses lèvres tremblaient, il fut sur le point de se révolter, pendant que Mignon se faisait bonhomme, lui donnant sur l’épaule des tapes affectueuses à le casser en deux, répétant :","And he would take it away, and he would shake it, before putting it back on the ground.

"Pour se garer des oreilles curieuses, il les mena dans le magasin des accessoires, derrière la scène. Mignon, surpris, les regarda disparaître. On descendait quelques marches. C'était une pièce carrée, dont les deux fenêtres donnaient sur la cour. Un jour de cave entrait par les vitres sales, blafard sous le plafond bas. Là, dans des casiers, qui encombraient la pièce, traînait un bric-à-brac d’objets de toutes sortes, le déballage d’un revendeur de la rue de Lappe41 qui liquide, un pêle-mêle sans nom d’assiettes, de coupes en carton doré, de vieux parapluies rouges, de cruches italiennes, de pendules de tous les styles, de plateaux et d’encriers, d’armes à feu et de seringues ; le tout sous une couche de poussière d’un pouce42, méconnaissable, ébréché, cassé, entassé.

A cellar day entered through the dirty panes, pale under the low ceiling. There, in lockers cluttering the room, lay a bric-a-brac of objects of all kinds, the unpacking of a dealer in the rue de Lappe41 who is liquidating, an unnamed jumble of plates, gilded cardboard cups, old red umbrellas, Italian jugs, clocks of all styles, trays and inkwells, firearms and syringes; all under a one inch layer of dust, unrecognizable, chipped, broken, piled up. And an unbearable smell of scrap metal, rags, damp cardboard, rose from these heaps, where the debris of plays had been piling up for fifty years.","To be out of the way of indiscreet ears, he took them to the property room behind the stage. Mignon watched them go off, greatly surprised. A few steps descended to the room, which was square, with a couple of windows looking on to the courtyard.

In pigeon-holes placed about the room was a collection of all sorts of things—the turn-out of a second-hand dealer of the Rue de Lappeau selling off, an odd medley of plates, of cups in gilded pasteboard, of old red umbrellas, of Italian pitchers, of clocks of every shape and size, of trays and inkstands, of firearms and squirts— the whole heaped anyhow, chipped, broken, unrecognisable, and covered with a layer of dust an inch thick; and an unbearable stench of old iron and rags and of damp pasteboard arose from the piles formed of the remains of the pieces produced during a period of fifty years.","In order to escape from curious listeners he led them into the property room behind the scenes, while Mignon watched their disappearance in some surprise.

In pigeonholes and shelves, which filled the whole place up, lay a collection of the most varied kind of bric-a-brac. Indeed, it suggested an old-clothes shop in the Rue de Lappe in process of selling off, so indescribable was the hotchpotch of plates, gilt pasteboard cups, old red umbrellas, Italian jars, clocks in all styles, platters and inkpots, firearms and squirts, which lay chipped and broken and in unrecognizable heaps under a layer of dust an inch deep. An unendurable odor of old iron, rags and damp cardboard emanated from the various piles, where the debris of forgotten dramas had been collecting for half a century.","To be safe from eavesdroppers, he took them behind the stage into the props-room.

They were on their own in the silent house."
"Simonne semblait fort ennuyée. La lettre était d’un jeune homme auquel elle avait promis pour le soir. Elle remit à madame Bron un billet griffonné : « Pas possible ce soir, mon chéri, je suis prise. » Mais elle restait inquiète ; ce jeune homme allait peut-être l’attendre quand même. Comme elle n’était pas du troisième acte, elle voulait partir tout de suite. Alors, elle pria Clarisse d’aller voir. Celle-ci entrait seulement en scène vers la fin de l’acte. Elle descendit, pendant que Simonne remontait un instant à la loge qu’elles occupaient en commun.","Simonne seemed very annoyed. The letter was from a young man to whom she had promised for the evening. She handed Madame Bron a scribbled note: ""Not possible tonight, darling, I'm taken."" But she remained uneasy; this young man was perhaps going to wait for him all the same. Since she wasn't in the third act, she wanted to leave right away. So she begged Clarisse to go and see. She only entered the scene towards the end of the act. She went downstairs, while Simonne went up for a moment to the box they occupied in common.","Simone seemed very much worried. The letter was from a young man whom she had promised to meet that evening. She gave Madame Bron a note she had hastily scribbled, “Not to-night, ducky; I’m engaged.” But she remained very anxious; the young man might wait for her all the same. As she was not in the third act, she wished to get away at once, so she asked Clarisse to go and see. The latter had nothing to do until almost the end of the piece. She went down stairs, whilst Simone returned for a minute to the dressing-room they shared together.","Simonne seemed much worried. The letter was from a young man to whom she had engaged herself for that evening. She gave Mme Bron a scribbled note in which were the words, ""Impossible tonight, darling--I'm booked. "" But she was still apprehensive; the young man might possibly wait for her in spite of everything. As she was not playing in the third act, she had a mind to be off at once and accordingly begged Clarisse to go and see if the man were there. Clarisse was only due on the stage toward the end of the act, and so she went downstairs while Simonne ran up for a minute to their common dressing room.","she said, looking back at Simonne. Simonne was looking extremely annoyed: the note was from a young man whom she’d promised to see that night. She scribbled a note and handed it to Madame Bron: ‘Can’t make it tonight, darling, I’m not free.’ But she was worried that the young man might still go on waiting for her all the same, so as she didn’t appear in the third act she was anxious to leave at once. She asked Clarisse, who didn’t have to go on till near the end of the act, to go and have a look for her. Clarisse went off downstairs while Simonne slipped up for a moment to the dressing-room which they shared."
"Mais, comme elle remontait à sa loge, madame Bron, qui se promenait à nouveau avec des lettres, lui en remit une. Bordenave, baissant la voix, reprochait furieusement à la concierge d’avoir laissé passer la Tricon ; cette femme ! juste ce soir-là ! ça l’indignait, à cause de Son Altesse. Madame Bron, depuis trente ans dans le théâtre, répondit sur un ton d’aigreur. Est-ce qu’elle savait ? La Tricon faisait des affaires avec toutes ces dames ; vingt fois monsieur le directeur l’avait rencontrée sans rien dire. Et, pendant que Bordenave mâchait de gros mots, la Tricon, tranquille, examinait fixement le prince, en femme qui pèse un homme d’un regard. Un sourire éclaira son visage jaune. Puis, elle s’en alla, d’un pas lent, au milieu des petites femmes respectueuses.","But, as she was going back to her box, Madame Bron, who was again walking around with letters, handed her one. Bordenave, lowering his voice, furiously reproached the concierge for having allowed the Tricon to pass; this woman ! just that night! that made him indignant, on account of His Highness. Madame Bron, who had been in the theater for thirty years, replied in a sour tone. Did she know? The Tricon did business with all these ladies; twenty times the manager had met her without saying a word. And, while Bordenave was chewing swear words, La Tricon, tranquil, gazed intently at the prince, like a woman who weighs a man with a glance. A smile lit up his yellow face. Then she went away, with a slow step, in the midst of the respectful little women.","But, as she went up to her dressing-room, Madame Bron, who was again distributing some letters, handed her one. Bordenave, in a low tone of voice, began abusing the doorkeeper for having let old Tricon into the theatre. That woman in the place when His Highness was there! it was disgusting! Madame Bron, who had been thirty years in the theatre, replied in a surly tone of voice: How was she to know? Madame Tricon transacted business with all the ladies. M. Bordenave had seen her there dozens of times without ever saying a word; and whilst the manager muttered a string of oaths, old Tricon coolly examined the prince, staring him straight in the face, like a woman who weighs a man with a glance. A smile lighted up her yellow countenance. Then she slowly retired in the midst of the little women, who respectfully made way for her to pass.","But as she was going upstairs again to her dressing room, Mme Bron, who was once more going the rounds with letters, presented one to her. Bordenave lowered his voice and furiously reproached the portress for having allowed the Tricon to come in. That woman! And on such an evening of all others! It made him so angry because His Highness was there! Mme Bron, who had been thirty years in the theater, replied quite sourly. How was she to know? she asked. The Tricon did business with all the ladies--M. le Directeur had met her a score of times without making remarks. And while Bordenave was muttering oaths the Tricon stood quietly by, scrutinizing the prince as became a woman who weighs a man at a glance. A smile lit up her yellow face. Presently she paced slowly off through the crowd of deeply deferential little women.","But then, as she was on her way up to her dressing-room, Madame Bron, who was once again delivering notes, handed her one. Bordenave was furiously telling the door-keeper off in an undertone for letting Tricon in; that woman, tonight of all nights! What on earth would His Highness think? Madame Bron, who’d spent the last thirty years of her life in the theatre, replied sourly: how could she have known? Tricon did business with all these ladies; the manager had encountered her a score of times without saying anything. And while Bordenave was cursing and spluttering, Tricon was calmly and carefully looking the prince over like a woman who can size up a man at a glance. Her sallow face lit up with a smile. Then she went slowly off under the respectful gaze of Bordenave’s ‘little women’."

"— Mais quant à la petite fête de la fin, oh ! très chic ! reprit Nana. Il paraît que ç’a été terrible, à vous donner la chair de poule. Il avait écarté tout le monde, il s’était enfermé là-dedans, avec du pétrole... Et ça brûlait, fallait voir ! Pensez donc, une grande machine presque toute en bois, pleine de paille et de foin !... Les flammes montaient comme des tours... Le plus beau, c’étaient les chevaux qui ne voulaient pas rôtir.

He got everybody out of the way, and shut himself inside, with some petroleum. And it blazed away—ah! it must have been a sight! Just fancy, a big place like that nearly all of wood, and full of hay and straw! The flames, they say, rose nearly as high as steeples. The best part was the horses, who didn’t want to be roasted. They were heard kicking and flinging themselves against the doors, and uttering cries like human beings. Some of the people there nearly died from fright.”","""But as to the merry little finish up, oh, that was awfully smart!"" continued Nana. ""It appears to have been terrible enough to give you the shudders! He sent everybody away and boxed himself up in the place with a lot of petroleum. And it blazed! You should have seen it! Just think, a great big affair, almost all made of wood and stuffed with hay and straw! The flames simply towered up, and the finest part of the business was that the horses didn't want to be roasted. They could be heard plunging, throwing themselves against the doors, crying aloud just like human beings. Yes, people haven't got rid of the horror of it yet.""","‘But as for his little farewell party, I think it was super!’ Nana continued. ‘ Apparently it was dreadful, enough to make your flesh creep.

"Cependant, il y avait de bonnes aubaines, des louis 70 attrapés avec des messieurs bien, qui montaient en mettant leur décoration dans la poche. Satin surtout avait le nez. Les soirs humides, lorsque Paris mouillé exhalait une odeur fade de grande alcôve 71 mal tenue, elle savait que ce temps mou, cette fétidité 72 des coins louches enrageaient les hommes. Et elle guettait les mieux mis, elle voyait ça à leurs yeux pâles. C'était comme un coup de folie charnelle passant sur la ville. Elle avait bien un peu peur, car les plus comme il faut étaient les plus sales. Tout le vernis craquait, la bête se montrait, exigeante dans ses goûts monstrueux, raffinant sa perversion. Aussi cette roulure de Satin manquait-elle de respect, s’éclatant devant la dignité des gens en voiture, disant que leurs cochers étaient plus gentils, parce qu’ils respectaient les femmes et qu’ils ne les tuaient pas avec des idées de l’autre monde. La culbute des gens chic dans la crapule du vice surprenait encore Nana, qui gardait des préjugés73, dont Satin la débarrassait. Alors, comme elle le disait, lorsqu’elle causait gravement, il n’y avait donc plus de vertu ? Du haut en bas, on se roulait. Eh bien ! ça devait être du propre, dans Paris, de neuf heures du soir à trois heures du matin ; et elle rigolait, elle criait que, si l’on avait pu voir dans toutes les chambres, on aurait assisté à quelque chose de drôle, le petit monde s’en donnant par-dessus les oreilles, et pas mal de grands personnages, çà et là, le nez enfoncé dans la cochonnerie plus profondément que les autres. Ça complétait son éducation.","However, there were good bargains, 70 louis caught with good gentlemen, who went upstairs putting their decoration in their pocket. Satin especially had the nose. On humid evenings, when wet Paris exhaled the insipid odor of a large, badly kept alcove, she knew that this mild weather, this fetidness 72 of dodgy corners enraged the men. And she watched for the best dressed, she saw that in their pale eyes. It was like a stroke of carnal madness passing over the city. She was a little scared, because the most decent ones were the dirtiest. All the varnish cracked, the beast showed itself, demanding in its monstrous tastes, refining its perversion. So that rotten Satin was lacking in respect, bursting out at the dignity of people in cars, saying that their drivers were nicer, because they respected women and didn't kill them with ideas of lust. 'other world. The tumble of chic people into the scoundrel of vice still surprised Nana, who retained the prejudices73 that Satin rid her of. So, as she said, when she talked seriously, there was no longer any virtue? From top to bottom, we rolled. Well ! it must have been proper, in Paris, from nine o'clock in the evening to three o'clock in the morning; and she was laughing, she was shouting that, if we had been able to see in all the rooms, we would have witnessed something funny, the little people giving it over their ears, and a lot of great characters, that and there, his nose sunk deeper into the filth than the others. It completed his education.","However, they occasionally had some very good windfalls—louis given them by well-dressed gentlemen, who put their decorations in their pockets as they accompanied them. Satin especially scented them from afar. On wet nights, when dank Paris emitted the unsavoury smell of a vast alcove seldom cleansed, she knew that the dampness of the atmosphere, the fetidness of the low haunts, excited the men. And she watched for those that were the best off; she could see it in their pale eyes. It was like a stroke of carnal madness passing over the city. It is true that she was at times rather frightened, for she knew that the most gentlemanly-looking men were generally the most filthy-minded. All the polish vanished and the brute appeared beneath, exacting in his monstrous tastes and refined in his perversion. So Satin, therefore, had no respect for the great people in their carriages, but would say that their coachmen were far nicer, for they treated women as they should be treated, and did not half kill them with ideas worthy of hell. This fall of well-to-do people into the crapulence of vice still astonished Nana, who had reserved certain prejudices of which Satin relieved her. When seriously discussing the subject she would ask, Was there, then, no virtue? From the highest to the lowest, all seemed to grovel in vice. Well! there were some pretty doings in Paris from nine in the evening till three in the morning; and then she would laugh aloud and exclaim that if one were only able to look into all the rooms, one would witness some very queer things—the lower classes going in for a regular treat, and here and there not a few of the upper classes poking their noses even more than the others into the beastly goings-on. She was completing her education.","Nevertheless, some windfalls came in their way now and then in the shape of louis picked up in the society of elegant gentlemen, who slipped their decorations into their pockets as they went upstairs with them. Satin had an especially keen scent for these. On rainy evenings, when the dripping city exhaled an unpleasant odor suggestive of a great untidy bed, she knew that the soft weather and the fetid reek of the town's holes and corners were sure to send the men mad. And so she watched the best dressed among them, for she knew by their pale eyes what their state was. On such nights it was as though a fit of fleshly madness were passing over Paris. The girl was rather nervous certainly, for the most modish gentlemen were always the most obscene. All the varnish would crack off a man, and the brute beast would show itself, exacting, monstrous in lust, a past master in corruption. But besides being nervous, that trollop of a Satin was lacking in respect. She would blurt out awful things in front of dignified gentlemen in carriages and assure them that their coachmen were better bred than they because they behaved respectfully toward the women and did not half kill them with their diabolical tricks and suggestions. The way in which smart people sprawled head over heels into all the cesspools of vice still caused Nana some surprise, for she had a few prejudices remaining, though Satin was rapidly destroying them. ""Well then,"" she used to say when talking seriously about the matter, ""there's no such thing as virtue left, is there?"" From one end of the social ladder to the other everybody was on the loose! Good gracious! Some nice things ought to be going on in Paris between nine o'clock in the evening and three in the morning! And with that she began making very merry and declaring that if one could only have looked into every room one would have seen some funny sights--the little people going it head over ears and a good lot of swells, too, playing the swine rather harder than the rest. Oh, she was finishing her education!","All the same, there were odd windfalls: twenty francs collected from respectable, middle-class gentlemen who slipped the decoration out of their buttonhole into their pocket as they made their way upstairs—Satin in particular had a good nose for this sort of man. On wet nights, when Paris had the stale, damp smell of a bedroom not properly cleaned, she knew that this gamy, musty odour made men crazy for a woman. And she’d keep a look-out for the best-dressed ones; she could recognize them by their pale eyes. It was as if a wave of wild randiness was sweeping over the city. True, she was a little scared because it was the most prim and proper who were the dirtiest; all their veneer vanished, they became like animals, insisting on the most revolting practices and every possible refinement of perversion. This was why the little floozy was no respecter of persons, letting fly when she saw people sitting in their carriages looking all dignified; their coachmen were nicer, because they respected women and didn’t want filthy, unnatural, freaky things which did for a girl. Even Nana, who had certain preconceptions which Satin was busily demolishing, was surprised that smart people could sink so low. So there’s no decency left any more, she’d say, when she was in a serious mood: people were lying to each other, from the top to the bottom. Well, a fine sight that must be in Paris from nine in the evening to three o’clock in the morning! And she laughed out loud and exclaimed that you’d see some funny things if you could look into every bedroom, with ordinary people having it off with each other like mad and quite a few grand people as well, here and there, with their snouts in the trough, even dirtier than the others. Her education was being completed."
"Depuis le matin, Zoé avait livré l’appartement à un maître d’hôtel, venu de chez Brébant 1 avec un personnel d’aides et de garçons. C’était Brébant qui devait tout fournir, le souper, la vaisselle, les cristaux, le linge, les fleurs, jusqu’à des sièges et à des tabourets. Nana n’aurait pas trouvé une douzaine de serviettes au fond de ses armoires ; et, n’ayant pas encore eu le temps de se mon-trer dans son nouveau lançage, dédaignant d’aller au restaurant, elle avait préféré faire venir le restaurant chez elle. Ça lui semblait plus chic. Elle voulait fêter son grand succès d’actrice par un souper, dont on parlerait. Comme la salle à manger était trop petite, le maître d’hôtel avait dressé la table dans le salon, une table où tenaient vingt-cinq couverts, un peu serrés.","Since morning, Zoe had delivered the apartment to a butler, who had come from Brébant 1 with a staff of assistants and waiters. It was Brébant who was to provide everything, supper, crockery, crystals, linen, flowers, even chairs and stools. Nana would not have found a dozen napkins at the back of her cupboards; and, not having yet had time to show herself in her new launch, disdaining to go to the restaurant, she had preferred to have the restaurant come to her house. It seemed more chic to him. She wanted to celebrate her great success as an actress with a dinner, which people would talk about. As the dining room was too small, the maitre d' had set the table in the living room, a table which held twenty-five place settings, a little close together.","Ever since the morning, Zoé had given up the entire apartment to a person who had arrived from Brébant’s with quite a staff of waiters and other assistants. Brébant was to furnish everything—the supper, the glass and crockery, the table-linen, flowers, and even seats and stools. Nana would not have found a dozen napkins if she had ransacked all her cupboards, and, not having as yet had time to set herself up in everything since her new start in life, disdaining to go to a restaurant, she had preferred to make the restaurant come to her. It was more the thing. She wished to celebrate her great success as an actress by a supper which would be the talk of every one.

Nana could not have mustered a dozen napkins out of all her cupboards, and not having had time to get a proper outfit after her new start in life and scorning to go to the restaurant, she had decided to make the restaurant come to her. It struck her as being more the thing. She wanted to celebrate her great success as an actress with a supper which should set people talking. As her dining room was too small, the manager had arranged the table in the drawing room, a table with twenty-five covers, placed somewhat close together.","SINCE morning Zoé had handed over the flat to a man from the catering firm of Brébant,* with a staff of assistants and waiters. Brébant was to provide everything, the food, the crockery, the cut-glass, the table linen, the flowers, even the chairs for the supper party. Nana wouldn’t have been able to dig even a dozen table napkins out of her cupboards, and not having yet found time to set herself up properly in her new career, she had rejected the idea of a restaurant and opted to bring the restaurant into her own home. It seemed the smarter thing to do. As the dining-room wasn’t big enough, the caterer had laid up the table in the drawing-room for twenty-five people, leaving not much elbow-room."
"— Qu’est-ce que ça me fiche ! répéta Nana. C'est drôle, ça... Ah ! ça y est, avec Fauchery. Eh bien, tant mieux, elle m’agaçait. Nous allons rire.","""What does it bother me!"" repeated Nana. It's funny, that... Ah! that's it, with Fauchery. Well, so much the better, she annoyed me. We will laugh.","“What the deuce do I care?” repeated Nana. “It’s awfully funny, though. Ah! so it’s true about Fauchery. Well! so much the better, she annoyed me immensely. What a joke it’ll be.”","""What the deuce has that got to do with me?"" Nana repeated. ""It's a funny business. So the whole story about Fauchery's in it! Very well, so much the better; the woman has been exasperating me! We shall have a good laugh!""","‘Why should I worry?’ repeated Nana. ‘That’s funny, that is … So that’s cooked Fauchery’s goose. Well, so much the better, she was getting on my nerves. It’ll be fun.’"
"Et la conversation allait partir de là, lorsque des voix bruyantes s’élevèrent à la porte de la loge. Bordenave tira la planchette d’un judas28 grillé de couvent. C'était Fontan, suivi de Prullière et de Bosc, ayant tous les trois des bouteilles sous les bras, et les mains chargées de verres. Il frappait, il criait que c’était sa fête, qu’il payait du champagne. Nana, d’un regard, avait consulté le prince. Comment donc ! Son Altesse ne voulait gêner personne, elle serait trop heureuse.

"Elle fut horriblement blessée. Toute la soirée, il la blagua, en l’appelant mademoiselle Mars78.

Lorsque Bosc lui adressait des observations, il criait, exaspéré, sans qu’on sût pourquoi, qu’il se fichait d’elle et de ses bons dîners, qu’il la flanquerait dehors rien que pour faire cadeau de ses sept mille francs à une autre femme.

He became her vice, which she paid for, her need, which she could not do without, under the sting of the slaps. He, seeing the good beast, ended up abusing it. She got on his nerves, he took on a fierce hatred, to the point of no longer taking her interests into account.

Whenever Bosc made an observation on the subject, he exclaimed, exasperated without any one knowing why, that he did not care a curse for her or her good dinners, and that he would turn her out of the place, just for the sake of spending the seven thousand francs on another woman. And that was indeed the end of their intimacy.","She was dreadfully wounded. All that evening he kept chaffing her, calling her Mlle Mars. But the harder he hit the more bravely she suffered, for she derived a certain bitter satisfaction from this heroic devotion of hers, which rendered her very great and very loving in her own eyes. Ever since she had gone with other men in order to supply his wants her love for him had increased, and the fatigues and disgusts encountered outside only added to the flame. He was fast becoming a sort of pet vice for which she paid, a necessity of existence it was impossible to do without, seeing that blows only stimulated her desires. He, on his part, seeing what a good tame thing she had become, ended by abusing his privileges. She was getting on his nerves, and he began to conceive so fierce a loathing for her that he forgot to keep count of his real interests. When Bosc made his customary remarks to him he cried out in exasperation, for which there was no apparent cause, that he had had enough of her and of her good dinners and that he would shortly chuck her out of doors if only for the sake of making another woman a present of his seven thousand francs. Indeed, that was how their liaison ended.","She was deeply offended. For the rest of the evening he pulled her leg, addressing her as Mademoiselle Mars. * And the more he ridiculed her, the more she gritted her teeth, taking a bitter enjoyment in her crazy, heroic infatuation which made her, in her eyes, a very noble woman, capable of great love. Ever since she’d been going with other men in order to provide for Fontan, she loved him all the more because of the disgust and hardships she suffered for his sake. He was her private vice which she couldn’t do without and for which she was prepared to pay the price; his thrashings added zest. Seeing how stupidly good-natured she was, in the end Fontan started to take advantage. She was getting on his nerves and a savage hatred was growing inside him, even blinding him to his own interests. Any comments by Bosc would make him fly into a rage for no apparent reason; he’d shout that he didn’t give a damn for her or her wonderful meals, that he’d kick her out just for the pleasure of offering his seven thousand francs to some other woman. And that was how their relationship eventually broke up."
"À son tour, elle s’interrompit. Elle n’avait pas besoin de penser tout haut. Enfin, elle eut l’air d’entrer dans les vues de Mignon, pour se débarrasser de lui ; et, comme il lui conseillait une soumission auprès de Rose, par exemple une petite visite sur le champ de courses, devant tous, elle répondit qu’elle verrait, qu’elle réfléchirait.","In turn, she paused. She didn't have to think out loud. Finally, she seemed to agree with Mignon's views, to get rid of him; and, as he advised her to submit to Rose, for example a little visit to the racecourse, in front of everyone, she replied that she would see, that she would reflect.","But in her turn she interrupted herself. There was no need for her to think out aloud. At last, she pretended to enter into Mignon’s views, so as to get rid of him; and, as he advised her to give in a bit to Rose—to pay her a little visit, for instance, there, before everyone—she replied that she would see, that she would think about it.","She broke off, in her turn. There was no need for her to think aloud. So in order to be rid of Mignon she looked as though she entered into his view of the case, and when he advised her to give Rose some proof of her submission--to pay her a short visit on the racecourse, for instance, where everybody would see her--she replied that she would see about it, that she would think the matter over.","‘On the contrary . . .’ But this time it was she who broke off; she didn’t need to think out loud. Finally, in order to get rid of him, she seemed to come round to his point of view and when he advised her to show Rose a little deference, for instance by paying her a short visit on the racecourse, which everybody would be able to see , she replied that she’d think about it."

"Toutes regardaient le lit du coin de l’œil, sans bouger. Pourtant, elles s’apprêtaient, elles donnaient de légères tapes sur leurs jupes. À la fenêtre, Lucy s’était accoudée de nouveau, toute seule. Une tristesse peu à peu la serrait à la gorge, comme si une mélancolie profonde eût monté de cette foule hurlante. Des torches passaient encore, secouant des flammèches ; au loin, les bandes moutonnaient, allongées dans les ténèbres, pareilles à des troupeaux menés de nuit à l’abattoir ; et ce vertige, ces masses confuses, roulées par le flot, exhalaient une terreur, une grande pitié de massacres futurs. Ils s’étourdissaient, les cris se brisaient dans l’ivresse de leur fièvre se ruant à l’inconnu, là-bas, derrière le mur noir de l’horizon.","They all looked at the bed out of the corner of their eyes, without moving. However, they were getting ready, they gave light pats on their skirts. At the window, Lucy was leaning on her elbow again, all by herself. Gradually a sadness gripped her throat, as if a deep melancholy had risen from this howling crowd. Torches were still passing, shaking sparks; in the distance, the bands flocked, stretched out in the darkness, like herds led by night to the slaughterhouse; and this vertigo, these confused masses, rolled by the waves, exhaled a terror, a great pity for future massacres. They were dazed, the cries broke in the intoxication of their fever rushing to the unknown, over there, behind the black wall of the horizon.","They all glanced at the bed, without stirring. Yet they were getting ready to leave, they gently smoothed down their skirts. At the window Lucy was again leaning out, but alone. A sadness brought a lump to her throat, as though a profound melancholy arose from that yelling mob beneath. Torches continued to pass, casting flakes of fire around; in the distance the various bands, huddled together in the darkness, looked like flocks of sheep driven at night-time to the slaughter-house; and all that giddiness, those confused masses surging like the ocean, exhaled a terror, a great pity for coming massacres. They banished dull care, their shouts burst out in the intoxication of their fever rushing against the unknown, far away in the distance, behind the dark boundary of the horizon.","They all looked at the bed out of the corners of their eyes, but they did not budge an inch. Nevertheless, they began getting ready and gave their skirts various little pats. Lucy was again leaning out of window. She was alone now, and a sorrowful feeling began little by little to overpower her, as though an intense wave of melancholy had mounted up from the howling mob. Torches still kept passing, shaking out clouds of sparks, and far away in the distance the various bands stretched into the shadows, surging unquietly to and fro like flocks being driven to the slaughterhouse at night. A dizzy feeling emanated from these confused masses as the human flood rolled them along--a dizzy feeling, a sense of terror and all the pity of the massacres to come. The people were going wild; their voices broke; they were drunk with a fever of excitement which sent them rushing toward the unknown ""out there"" beyond the dark wall of the horizon.","They all looked sideways at the bed but made no move to go, though giving their skirts little taps in preparation for their departure. Lucy was again leaning with her elbows on the window-sill, away from the others. A lump was slowly forming in her throat, as if the yelling crowd outside was itself making her miserable. Torches were still being carried past, throwing out sparks; in the distance, the groups of people were rippling in the gloom like long flocks of sheep being led by night to the slaughter, and this confused, whirling mass of people streaming by created a feeling of terror and immense pity for the massacres to come. They were bewildered, their voices cracking in the frenzy of their intoxication as they hurtled towards their unknown fate beyond the dark wall of the horizon."
"Peu à peu, cependant, les conversations tombaient, mollement, avec des reprises de voix grasses. Et, au milieu de ce murmure pâmé, de ces soupirs mourants, l’orchestre éclatait en petites notes vives, une valse dont le rythme canaille avait le rire d’une polissonnerie. Le public, chatouillé, souriait déjà. Mais la claque34, aux premiers rangs du parterre35, tapa furieusement des mains. Le rideau se levait.","Gradually, however, the conversations died down, sluggishly, with resumptions of greasy voices. And, in the midst of this swooning murmur, these dying sighs, the orchestra broke out in lively little notes, a waltz whose rascal rhythm had the laughter of a prank.

The curtain was rising.","By degrees, however, the noise subsided, with an occasional swell from time to time.

The audience, fairly tickled, already began to smile; but the claque, seated in the front row of the pit, commenced to applaud vociferously. The curtain rose.","Little by little, however, the buzz of talk dwindled softly down among occasional fresh outbursts of rough speech.

The curtain rose.","Gradually, apart from the odd raucous outburst, the talking gently died down, and in the middle of this muffled murmur, as the noise subsided to a whisper, the orchestra burst into a lively sort of jig, a waltz with a rhythm as vulgar as a dirty laugh.

"Cependant, ce coup de pluie avait brusquement empli les tribunes. Nana regardait avec sa jumelle. À cette distance, on distinguait seulement une masse compacte et brouillée, entassée sur les gradins, un fond sombre que les taches pâles des figures éclairaient. Le soleil glissait par des coins de toiture, écornait la foule assise d’un angle de lumière, où les toilettes semblaient déteindre. Mais Nana s’amusait surtout des dames que l’averse avait chassées des rangées de chaises, alignées sur le sable, au pied des tribunes. Comme l’entrée de l’enceinte du pesage était absolument interdite aux filles, Nana faisait des remarques pleines d’aigreur sur toutes ces femmes comme il faut, qu’elle trouvait fagotées, avec de drôles de têtes.","However, this sudden burst of rain had suddenly filled the stands. Nana watched with her twin. At this distance, one could only make out a compact and blurred mass, heaped on the steps, a dark background lighted up by the pale spots of the figures. The sun slipped through the corners of the roof, shattering the seated crowd from an angle of light, where the toilets seemed to rub off. But Nana was especially amused by the ladies whom the downpour had driven from the rows of chairs lined up on the sand at the foot of the stands. As the entrance to the weighing enclosure was absolutely forbidden to girls, Nana made remarks full of sourness about all these decent women, whom she found dowdy, with funny faces.","The shower, however, had had the effect of suddenly filling the stands. Nana looked at them through her field-glass. At that distance one could only distinguish a compact and mixed mass, piled up on the different tiers, a dark background broken by the pale faces. The sun filtered in through the corners of the roof, curtailing the seated crowd with angles of light, and giving a washed-out appearance to the costumes of the women. But Nana was most amused by the ladies whom the shower had driven from the rows of chairs placed on the gravel at the foot of the stands. As admission to the enclosure was rigorously denied to all gay women, Nana made the most spiteful remarks about the respectable members of her sex, who she considered were shockingly badly dressed and looked highly ridiculous.","Meanwhile the burst of rain had suddenly filled the stands. Nana looked at them through her field glasses. At that distance you could only distinguish a compact, confused mass of people, heaped up, as it were, on the ascending ranges of steps, a dark background relieved by light dots which were human faces. The sunlight filtered in through openings near the roof at each end of the stand and detached and illumined portions of the seated multitude, where the ladies' dresses seemed to lose their distinguishing colors. But Nana was especially amused by the ladies whom the shower had driven from the rows of chairs ranged on the sand at the base of the stands. As courtesans were absolutely forbidden to enter the enclosure, she began making exceedingly bitter remarks about all the fashionable women therein assembled. She thought them fearfully dressed up, and such guys!","Meanwhile, the sudden downpour had quickly filled the grandstands. Nana was peering through her binoculars. From this distance it was possible to pick out only a confused, compact mass of people piled up on the tiers of seats and forming a dark background speckled by pale, shining faces. Across the corner of the grandstand roofs the sun was casting a slanting beam of light on the seated crowd, turning the dresses of the ladies paler. Nana was particularly amused by the ladies who’d been driven away from their chairs which had been lined up on the sanded area in front of the grandstands. Access to the jockeys’ enclosure was strictly forbidden to all tarts, and she was making rude remarks about all these respectable married women who were so plain and dowdily dressed."

"En effet, il y avait des miettes. Elle en sentait jusque sous ses cuisses, elle était dévorée partout. Une seule miette la brûlait, la faisait se gratter au sang. D’ailleurs, lorsqu’on mange un gâteau, est-ce qu’on ne secoue pas toujours la couverture ? Fontan, dans une rage froide, avait allumé la bougie. Tous deux se levèrent ; et pieds nus, en chemise, découvrant le lit, ils balayèrent les miettes sur le drap, avec les mains. Lui, qui grelottait, se recoucha, en l’envoyant au diable, parce qu’elle lui recommandait de bien s’essuyer les pieds. Enfin, elle reprit sa place ; mais, à peine allongée, elle dansa. Il y en avait encore.","Indeed, there were crumbs. She felt it even under her thighs, she was devoured everywhere. A single crumb would burn her, make her scratch blood.

Both rose; and barefoot, in shirts, uncovering the bed, they brushed the crumbs off the sheet with their hands. He, who was shivering, went back to bed, sending her to hell, because she told him to wipe his feet well. Finally, she resumed her place; but as soon as she was lying down, she danced. There were still some.","And there were indeed crumbs in the bed. She even felt them under her legs, they were all about her. The smallest crumb irritated her, and made her scratch herself till her flesh bled. Besides, when one eats anything in bed, one should always shake the clothes afterwards. Fontan, in a towering rage, lit the candle. They both got out; and in their night-dresses, and with their feet bare, they uncovered the bed and swept the crumbs away with their hands. He, who was shivering all the time, hastily got back into bed, and told her to go to the devil, because she asked him to wipe his feet. Then she returned to her place; but she had scarcely lain down again before she recommenced her dance. There were still some crumbs left.","In fact, there were crumbs in the bed. She felt them down to her middle; she was everywhere devoured by them. One single crumb was scorching her and making her scratch herself till she bled. Besides, when one eats a cake isn't it usual to shake out the bedclothes afterward? Fontan, white with rage, had relit the candle, and they both got up and, barefooted and in their night dresses, they turned down the clothes and swept up the crumbs on the sheet with their hands. Fontan went to bed again, shivering, and told her to go to the devil when she advised him to wipe the soles of his feet carefully. And in the end she came back to her old position, but scarce had she stretched herself out than she danced again. There were fresh crumbs in the bed!","There were indeed crumbs in the bed. She could feel them under her thighs, she was itching all over; it only needed one single crumb rubbing her to make her scratch herself till she bled. Anyway, when someone eats a cake, doesn’t he always shake the blanket afterwards? Inwardly seething, Fontan re-lit the candle. They both got out of bed and in their night-wear uncovered it and swept the crumbs off with their hands. He went back to bed shivering and when she told him to make sure he wiped his feet properly, told her to go to hell. Finally she got into bed as well but still couldn’t settle down. There were still some crumbs."

"Nana reçut le comte Muffat, encore secouée, prise d’une certaine gêne. Elle lui avait promis, elle aurait même voulu tenir sa parole, parce que cet homme lui semblait sérieux. Mais, en vérité, qui se serait douté des histoires de la veille ? ce voyage, cette maison qu’elle ne connaissait pas, ce petit qui arrivait tout mouillé, et comme ça lui avait paru bon, et comme ce serait gentil de continuer ! Tant pis pour le monsieur ! Depuis trois mois, elle le faisait poser, jouant à la femme comme il faut, afin de l’allumer davantage. Eh bien ! il poserait encore, il s’en irait, si ça ne lui plaisait pas. Elle aurait plutôt tout lâché, que de tromper Georges.","Nana received Count Muffat, still shaken, seized with a certain embarrassment. She had promised him, she would have even wanted to keep her word, because this man seemed serious to her.

Too bad for the gentleman! For three months, she had him pose, playing the woman properly, in order to turn him on more. Well ! he would pose again, he would go away, if he did not like it. She would rather have dropped everything than deceive Georges.","When Count Muffat appeared, Nana felt a slight awkwardness, having scarcely regained her composure after the scene with George. She had promised the count, and she would have liked to have kept her promise, because he seemed a man who meant business. But, really, who could ever have foreseen all that had occurred the previous day? The journey, this house that she had never known before, the youngster who had arrived soaking wet; and how nice it had all seemed to her, and how pleasant a continuance of it would be! So much the worse for the gentleman! For three months past she had dallied with him, playing the respectable woman, so as to inflame him all the more. Well! he would have to wait a bit longer. He could hook it if it didn’t please him. She would rather chuck up everything than be unfaithful to George.","Nana welcomed Count Muffat, who, though still shaken with passion, was now somewhat embarrassed. She had pledged her word to him and would even have liked to keep it since he struck her as a serious, practicable lover. But truly, who could have foreseen all that happened yesterday? There was the voyage and the house she had never set eyes on before and the arrival of the drenched little lover! How sweet it had all seemed to her, and how delightful it would be to continue in it! So much the worse for the gentleman! For three months past she had been keeping him dangling after her while she affected conventionality in order the further to inflame him. Well, well! He would have to continue dangling, and if he didn't like that he could go! She would sooner have thrown up everything than have played false to Georges.","When she greeted Count Muffat, Nana was still shaken and rather embarrassed. She’d given him her word and would even have been glad to keep it, because this man seemed earnest and reliable. But who could really have foreseen what had happened yesterday, the journey, the unfamiliar house, the boy who’d turned up wet through; and how nice it had all seemed and how nice it would be to keep on like that! It was just the count’s bad luck! She’d been keeping him on tenterhooks for the last three months, pretending to be very proper in order to whet his appetite. Well, he’d have to go on waiting, that’s all, and if he didn’t like it, he’d have to lump it! She’d sooner give up everything rather than let Georges down."

"On passait sous des arbres. Nana flairait l’odeur des feuilles comme un jeune chien. Brusquement, à un détour de la route, elle aperçut le coin d’une habitation, dans les branches.

"Bordenave, scandalisé, se retint pour ne pas lui lancer un coup de pied dans le derrière. Mais le prince souriait, l’air heureux et excité d’avoir entendu ça, couvant du regard la petite femme qui se fichait de Son Altesse. Elle riait effrontément. Cependant, Bordenave décida le prince à le suivre. Le comte Muffat, pris de sueur, venait de retirer son chapeau ; ce qui l’incommodait surtout, c’était l’étouffement de l’air, épaissi, surchauffé, où traînait une odeur forte, cette odeur de coulisses, puant le gaz, la colle des décors, la saleté des coins sombres, les dessous douteux des figurantes. Dans le couloir, la suffocation augmentait encore ; des aigreurs d’eaux de toilette, des parfums de savons descendus des loges, y coupaient par instants l’empoisonnement des haleines. En passant, le comte leva la tête, jeta un coup d’œil dans la cage de l’escalier, saisi du brusque flot de lumière et de chaleur qui lui tombait sur la nuque. Il y avait, en haut, des bruits de cuvette, des rires et des appels, un vacarme de portes dont les continuels battements lâchaient des senteurs de femme, le musc 21 des fards mêlé à la rudesse fauve des chevelures. Et il ne s’arrêta pas, hâtant sa marche, fuyant presque, en emportant à fleur de peau le frisson de cette trouée ardente sur un monde qu’il ignorait.","Bordenave, scandalized, refrained from kicking him in the behind. But the prince was smiling, looking happy and excited to have heard that, gazing at the little woman who didn't care about His Highness. She laughed cheekily. However, Bordenave persuaded the prince to follow him. Count Muffat, seized with sweat, had just taken off his hat; what bothered him above all was the suffocation of the air, thickened, overheated, in which trailed a strong smell, this backstage smell, reeking of gas, the glue from the sets, the dirt in the dark corners, the underwear questionable extras. In the corridor, the suffocation increased still more; the bitterness of toilet waters, the perfumes of soaps coming down from the boxes, cut off at times the poisoning of the breaths. As he passed, the Count raised his head, cast a glance into the stairwell, seized by the sudden flood of light and warmth which fell on the back of his neck. Upstairs there was the sound of toilets, laughter and calls, a din of doors whose continual knocking released the scent of women, the musk of make-up mingled with the tawny coarseness of hair. And he did not stop, hastening his walk, almost fleeing, carrying the thrill of this fiery break into a world he did not know.","Bordenave, awfully scandalized, only restrained himself with difficulty from kicking her behind; but the prince smiled, looking delighted and excited at having overheard the words, whilst he gazed tenderly on the little woman, who didn’t care a fig for His Highness. She laughed impudently. However, Bordenave at length induced the prince to follow him. Count Muffat, all in a perspiration, removed his hat. What inconvenienced him most was the closeness of the atmosphere, which had become overheated and, so to say, thick, and in which hovered a very strong smell—that odour of behind the scenes, stinking of gas, the glue of the scenery, the mouldy dirt in out-of-the-way corners, and the unwashed bodies of the female supers. In the passage the oppressiveness increased. The stench of dirty water, the perfume of scented soaps, escaped from the dressing-rooms, mingled now and again with the poisonous exhalations of foul breaths. As he passed, the count rapidly glanced up the staircase, struck by the sudden flood of light and warmth which descended upon him. From above came sounds of people washing, laughing, and calling to one another, a great noise of opening and shutting of doors, emitting feminine odours, the musk of the make-up mixed with the smell of perspiring heads of yellowy-red hair. He did not linger, but hastened his footsteps, almost flying under the emotion caused by this sudden glimpse of a world hitherto unknown to him.","Horrified, Bordenave had much ado not to give her a kick. But the prince smiled and looked pleased and excited by the remark. He gazed warmly at the little woman who did not care a button for His Highness, and she, on her part, laughed unblushingly. Bordenave, however, persuaded the prince to follow him. Muffat was beginning to perspire; he had taken his hat off. What inconvenienced him most was the stuffy, dense, overheated air of the place with its strong, haunting smell, a smell peculiar to this part of a theater, and, as such, compact of the reek of gas, of the glue used in the manufacture of the scenery, of dirty dark nooks and corners and of questionably clean chorus girls. In the passage the air was still more suffocating, and one seemed to breathe a poisoned atmosphere, which was occasionally relieved by the acid scents of toilet waters and the perfumes of various soaps emanating from the dressing rooms. The count lifted his eyes as he passed and glanced up the staircase, for he was well-nigh startled by the keen flood of light and warmth which flowed down upon his back and shoulders. High up above him there was a clicking of ewers and basins, a sound of laughter and of people calling to one another, a banging of doors, which in their continual opening and shutting allowed an odor of womankind to escape--a musky scent of oils and essences mingling with the natural pungency exhaled from human tresses. He did not stop. Nay, he hastened his walk: he almost ran, his skin tingling with the breath of that fiery approach to a world he knew nothing of.","Bordenave was so shocked that he nearly booted her behind, but the prince was smiling and excited by what he heard and looking fondly at this young woman who didn’t give a damn for His Royal Highness. She was laughing saucily. Meanwhile Bordenave persuaded the prince to follow him. Count Muffat, who still had his hat on, had broken into a sweat; in particular, he was feeling stifled by the heavy, overheated, backstage atmosphere, with its strong underlying stench of gas, stage-set glue, squalid dark corners, and the smell of the female extras’ unwashed underwear. The passageway was even more suffocating; from time to time the sharp scent of toilet-water and soap drifting down from the dressing-rooms blended with the pestilential odour of human breath. As he went by, the count raised his eyes and glanced up the stair-well, startled by the sudden burst of heat and light which struck the back of his neck from above. Upstairs there was a sound of wash-basins, laughter, shouts, and banging doors releasing female smells in which the musky odour of make-up mingled with the harsh animal scent of hair. He kept on walking, almost running away, his skin still tingling from this torrid view on to a world unknown."

"Mais Nana se pelotonnait sur elle-même. Un frisson de tendresse semblait avoir passé dans ses membres. Les yeux mouillés, elle se faisait petite, comme pour se mieux sentir. Puis, elle dénoua les mains, les abaissa le long d’elle par un glissement, jusqu’aux seins, qu’elle écrasa d’une étreinte nerveuse. Et rengorgée, se fondant dans une caresse de tout son corps, elle se frotta les joues à droite, à gauche, contre ses épaules, avec câlinerie. Sa bouche goulue soufflait sur elle le désir. Elle allongea les lèvres, elle se baisa longuement près de l’aisselle, en riant à l’autre Nana, qui, elle aussi, se baisait dans la glace.","But Nana curled up on herself. A shiver of tenderness seemed to have passed through his limbs. Her eyes wet, she made herself small, as if to feel better. Then she untied her hands, lowered them along her side by a slip, to the breasts, which she crushed in a nervous embrace. And engorged, melting into a caress of her whole body, she rubbed her cheeks to the right, to the left, against his shoulders, coaxingly. His greedy mouth breathed desire on her. She stretched out her lips, she kissed herself for a long time near the armpit, laughing at the other Nana, who was also kissing herself in the mirror.","Nana was now rolling herself up. A tremor of endearment seemed to have passed through her limbs. With moistened eyes she tried to become smaller, as though to feel herself all the better. Then she unclasped her hands behind her neck, and let them slip slowly down to her breasts, which she pressed in a nervous embrace. And, satiated, melting into a caress of her whole body, she fondlingly rubbed her cheeks, right and left, against her shoulders. Her rapacious mouth breathed desire upon her. She pouted her lips and kissed herself longingly close to her arm-pit, smiling the while at that other Nana who was also kissing herself in the looking-glass.","But Nana was gathering herself together. A little thrill of tenderness seemed to have traversed her members. Her eyes were moist; she tried, as it were, to make herself small, as though she could feel herself better thus. Then she threw her head and bosom back and, melting, as it were, in one great bodily caress, she rubbed her cheeks coaxingly, first against one shoulder, then against the other. Her lustful mouth breathed desire over her limbs. She put out her lips, kissed herself long in the neighborhood of her armpit and laughed at the other Nana who also was kissing herself in the mirror.","Now Nana was hugging herself; her limbs seemed to be quivering in a fit of tenderness. With eyes full of tears, she was trying to make herself as small as possible in order to feel herself better. Unclasping her hands, she slid them down her body as far as her breasts and squeezed them convulsively. Then, melting as though her whole body was being caressed, she flung out her chest and rubbed her cheeks tenderly to and fro over her shoulders. Her greedy lips were breathing desire over herself; she pursed them and placed a long kiss beside her armpit, laughing at the other Nana who was also kissing herself in the mirror."

"Puis, pour couper court, il présenta son cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, un jeune homme qui venait achever son éducation à Paris. Le directeur pesa le jeune homme d’un coup d’œil.

Hector crut qu’il devait chercher une phrase aimable.","Then, to cut it short, he introduced his cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, a young man who had just completed his education in Paris.

Hector thought he must be looking for a kind phrase.","Then, to prevent further discussion, he presented his cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, a young man who had come to complete his education in Paris. The manager weighed the young man at a glance; but Hector surveyed the manager with some little emotion. This then was Bordenave, the exhibitor of women, whom he treated in the style of a prison warder, and whose brain was ever hatching some fresh money-making scheme—a perfect cynic, always shouting, or spitting, or smacking his thighs, and possessing the coarse mind of a trooper! Hector was anxious to make a good impression on him.","Then to put an end to the discussion, he introduced his cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, a young man who had come to finish his education in Paris. The manager took the young man's measure at a glance. But Hector returned his scrutiny with deep interest. This, then, was that Bordenave, that showman of the sex who treated women like a convict overseer, that clever fellow who was always at full steam over some advertising dodge, that shouting, spitting, thigh- slapping fellow, that cynic with the soul of a policeman! Hector was under the impression that he ought to discover some amiable observation for the occasion.","To change the subject, he introduced his cousin: Monsieur Hector de la Faloise, a young man who’d come to complete his education in Paris. The manager threw him a sharp glance to size him up, but Hector was gazing at him, thrilled: so this was the Bordenave who put women on show and drove them like galley slaves, who always had some publicity stunt or other bubbling away in his head, shouting, spitting, slapping his thighs, a cynic with the mentality of a sergeant-major!

"Certes, Nana n’était pas méchante. Depuis les premiers mots, elle résistait à l’envie de lui envoyer son cocuage par la figure. Elle aurait aimé le confesser là-dessus, tranquillement.

"Dans son luxe royal, la nouvelle chambre resplendissait. Des capitons d’argent semaient d’étoiles vives le velours rose thé de la tenture, de ce rose de chair que le ciel prend par les beaux soirs, lorsque Vénus 54 s’allume à l’horizon, sur le fond clair du jour qui se meurt ; tandis que les cordelières d’or tombant des angles, les dentelles d’or encadrant les panneaux, étaient comme des flammes légères, des chevelures rousses dénouées, couvrant à demi la grande nudité 55 de la pièce, dont elles rehaussaient la pâleur voluptueuse. Puis, en face, c’était le lit d’or et d’argent qui rayonnait avec l’éclat neuf de ses ciselures, un trône assez large pour que Nana pût y étendre la royauté de ses membres nus, un autel d’une richesse byzantine 56 digne de la toute-puissance de son sexe, et où elle l’étalait à cette heure même, découvert, dans une religieuse impudeur d’idole redoutée. Et près d’elle, sous le reflet de neige de sa gorge, au milieu de son triomphe de déesse, se vautrait une honte, une décrépitude, une ruine comique et lamentable, le marquis de Chouard en chemise.","In its royal luxury, the new room shone. Silver dimples dotted the tea-pink velvet of the hangings with bright stars, that flesh pink that the sky takes on fine evenings, when Venus 54 lights up on the horizon, against the clear background of the day that dies ; while the gold cords falling from the angles, the gold lace framing the panels, were like light flames, loose red hair half covering the great bareness of the room, whose voluptuous pallor they heightened. Then, opposite, was the bed of gold and silver which shone with the new brilliance of its carvings, a throne large enough for Nana to lay there the royalty of her bare limbs, an altar of a Byzantine wealth 56 worthy of the omnipotence of her sex, and where she displayed it at this very hour, uncovered, in the religious shamelessness of a dreaded idol. And near her, under the reflection of snow on her throat, in the midst of her goddess-like triumph, wallowed a shame, a decrepitude, a comic and lamentable ruin, the Marquis de Chouard in his shirt.","The newly decorated room was resplendent in its regal luxury. Silver buttons strewed the tea rose velvet hangings with shining stars. It was the rosy colour of flesh which illuminates the sky on fine nights, when Venus sparkles at the horizon on the light background of the expiring day; whilst the cords of gold hanging down at the corners, the gold lace framing the panels, were like bright flames, or loose switches of red hair, half covering the great nudity of the room, the voluptuous paleness of which they enriched. Then, opposite, was the gold and silver bedstead, which shone with the new brightness of its chasings—a throne large enough for Nana to stretch the royalty of her naked limbs—an altar of a Byzantine richness, worthy of the all-powerfulness of her sex, and on which at this very moment she displayed it, uncovered, and in the religious immodesty of a dreaded idol. And, near her, beneath the snowy reflection of her bosom, in the midst of her goddess-like triumph, sprawled a shameful and decrepit object, a comical and lamentable ruin, the Marquis de Chouard in his night-shirt.","The renovated bedroom was resplendent in all its royal luxury. Silver buttons gleamed like bright stars on the tea-rose velvet of the hangings. These last were of that pink flesh tint which the skies assume on fine evenings, when Venus lights her fires on the horizon against the clear background of fading daylight. The golden cords and tassels hanging in corners and the gold lace-work surrounding the panels were like little flames of ruddy strands of loosened hair, and they half covered the wide nakedness of the room while they emphasized its pale, voluptuous tone. Then over against him there was the gold and silver bed, which shone in all the fresh splendor of its chiseled workmanship, a throne this of sufficient extent for Nana to display the outstretched glory of her naked limbs, an altar of Byzantine sumptuousness, worthy of the almighty puissance of Nana's sex, which at this very hour lay nudely displayed there in the religious immodesty befitting an idol of all men's worship. And close by, beneath the snowy reflections of her bosom and amid the triumph of the goddess, lay wallowing a shameful, decrepit thing, a comic and lamentable ruin, the Marquis de Chouard in his nightshirt.","The new bedroom was glittering with an opulence that was truly royal. The velvet drapes, flesh-coloured like the tea-rose pink sky on fine evenings when Venus is gleaming against the soft glow of the setting sun on the horizon, were dotted with the bright stars of silver buttons, while the barley-sugar gilt mouldings descending from each corner and the gold lace round the central panels seemed like darting flames, tresses of red hair floating loose, half-veiling the stark simplicity of the room and emphasizing its voluptuous cool tints. Opposite stood the gold and silver bed with its glittering new carvings, a throne fit to display the royal beauty of her naked limbs, an altar Byzantine in its luxury, a worthy setting for the irresistible power of the curved slit of her sex, which she was flaunting shamelessly with the divine arrogance of some aweinspiring idol. And lying beside her, against the snow-white breasts of this all-powerful goddess, there was a floundering, sordid, comical, miserable wreck, the Marquis de Chouard in his night-shirt."
"Zoé introduisait Mignon, Nana le reçut en souriant ; elle avait bien pleuré, c’était fini.

"Nana était peu à peu tombée dans un gros chagrin. D’abord la rencontre du marquis et du comte l’avait secouée d’une fièvre nerveuse, où il entrait presque de la gaieté. Puis, la pensée de ce vieux qui partait dans un fiacre, à moitié mort, et de son pauvre mufe qu’elle ne verrait plus, après l’avoir tant fait enrager, lui causa un commencement de mélancolie sentimentale. Ensuite, elle s’était fâchée en apprenant la maladie de Satin, disparue depuis quinze jours, et en train de crever à Lariboisière, tellement madame Robert l’avait mise dans un fichu état. Comme elle faisait atteler pour voir encore une fois cette petite ordure, Zoé venait tranquillement de lui donner ses huit jours67. Du coup, elle fut désespérée ; il lui semblait qu’elle perdait une personne de sa famille. Mon Dieu ! qu’allait-elle devenir, toute seule ! Et elle suppliait Zoé, qui, très flattée du désespoir de madame, finit par l’embrasser, pour montrer qu’elle ne partait pas fâchée contre elle ; il le fallait, le cœur se taisait devant les affaires. Mais ce jour-là était le jour des embêtements. Nana, prise de dégoût, ne songeant plus à sortir, se traînait dans son petit salon, lorsque Labordette, monté pour lui parler d’une occasion, des dentelles magnifiques, lâcha entre deux phrases, à propos de rien, que Georges était mort. Elle resta glacée.","Nana had gradually fallen into great grief. At first the meeting of the Marquis and the Count had shaken her with a nervous fever, into which there almost entered gaiety. Then, the thought of that old man who was leaving in a cab, half dead, and of his poor muff, whom she would see no more, after having made him so enraged, caused her the beginnings of sentimental melancholy. Then she got angry when she learned of Satin's illness, which had been gone for a fortnight, and was dying at Lariboisière, Madame Robert had put her in so much trouble. As she was harnessing her to see this little scum one more time, Zoe had quietly just given her her eight days. Suddenly, she was desperate; it seemed to her that she was losing a member of her family. My God ! what would become of her, all alone! And she begged Zoe, who, very flattered by Madame's despair, ended by kissing her, to show that she was not leaving angry with her; it was necessary, the heart was silent before business. But that day was the day of hassles. Nana, seized with disgust, no longer thinking of going out, was dragging herself into her little drawing-room, when Labordette, who had come upstairs to talk to her about an occasion, some magnificent lace, blurted out between two sentences, apropos of nothing, that Georges was dead. She remained frozen.","Nana little by little had become very sorrowful. At first the meeting of the marquis and the count had thrown her into a nervous fever, accompanied by a slight touch of gaiety. Then, the thought of the old fellow who had gone off in a cab, half dead, and of her poor muff whom she would never see again, after having so often vexed him, brought about the beginning of a sentimental melancholy. After this she had got quite angry on hearing of Satin’s illness. The girl had disappeared a fortnight before, and was now gradually dying at the Lariboisière Hospital, Madame Robert having put her into such a frightful state. As she was ordering the carriage to go and see the little baggage once more, Zoé had quietly given her a week’s notice to leave. That threw her into despair. It seemed as though she was losing one of her family; and she implored Zoé to remain. The latter, highly flattered by madame’s grief, ended by kissing her, to show that there was no ill-feeling at parting. She was obliged to go; the heart was silent when business was in question. But that was a day of worries. Nana, thoroughly disgusted, no longer thinking of going out, was wandering about her parlour, when Labordette, who had come to tell her of some magnificent lace to be had at a bargain, mentioned between two other phrases about nothing at all that George was dead. She turned icy cold.","Nana had gradually lapsed into a most mournful condition. To begin with, the meeting of the marquis and the count had given her a severe fit of feverish nervousness, which verged at times on laughter. Then the thought of this old man going away half dead in a cab and of her poor rough, whom she would never set eyes on again now that she had driven him so wild, brought on what looked like the beginnings of melancholia. After that she grew vexed to hear about Satin's illness. The girl had disappeared about a fortnight ago and was now ready to die at Lariboisiere, to such a damnable state had Mme Robert reduced her. When she ordered the horses to be put to in order that she might have a last sight of this vile little wretch Zoe had just quietly given her a week's notice. The announcement drove her to desperation at once! It seemed to her she was losing a member of her own family. Great heavens! What was to become of her when left alone? And she besought Zoe to stay, and the latter, much flattered by Madame's despair, ended by kissing her to show that she was not going away in anger. No, she had positively to go: the heart could have no voice in matters of business. But that day was one of annoyances. Nana was thoroughly disgusted and gave up the idea of going out. She was dragging herself wearily about the little drawing room when Labordette came up to tell her of a splendid chance of buying magnificent lace and in the course of his remarks casually let slip the information that Georges was dead. The announcement froze her.","Nana had gradually sunk into a state of deep depression. The encounter between the marquis and the count had given her a nasty nervous shock, even if causing her some amusement. Then the thought of this poor old man going off half-dead in his cab and of her little muff, whom she was seeing for the last time after causing him so much exasperation for so long, had put her in a gloomy, maudlin mood. In addition, she’d been annoyed to hear of Satin’s illness; she’d gone off a fortnight ago and seemed likely to die in Lariboisière* as a result of Madame Robert’s horrible treatment of her. As the carriage was being hitched up to go to visit her, Zoé had calmly given notice. She felt desperate; it was like losing a member of the family. Heavens above, what would become of her on her own? She pleaded with Zoé, who was highly flattered to see her mistress’s despair and ended by giving her a kiss to show that she wasn’t leaving because she was cross with her; she just had to go, business came before sentiment. So today was definitely not Nana’s lucky day. In disgust she’d decided not to go out after all, and she was lounging around in her little drawing-room when Labordette came up with news of a golden opportunity to buy some magnificent lace; he then casually let fall the information that Georges had died. Her blood ran cold."

Dehors, saisi par la douceur d’une belle matinée de juin, il n’avait plus retrouvé ses idées, il était venu chez Nana, comme il y venait à toutes les heures terribles de son existence. Là, seulement, il s’abandonnait dans sa misère, avec la joie lâche d’être consolé.","He nods yes. And silence fell again, a heavy silence in the aching room. It was the day before, on returning from a party with the Empress, that he had received the letter written by Sabine to her lover. After an atrocious night, spent dreaming of revenge, he had gone out in the morning, to resist the urge to kill his wife. Outside, seized by the mildness of a beautiful June morning, he had lost his thoughts, he had come to Nana's, as he had come there at all the terrible hours of his existence. There, only, he abandoned himself to his misery, with the cowardly joy of being consoled.","He nodded his head a second time. And silence again reigned, an oppressive silence, in that room of pain. It was the night before, on returning from a party at the Empress’s, that he had received the letter written by Sabine to her lover. After a frightful night, passed in dreaming of vengeance, he had gone out early in the morning, to withstand a temptation to kill his wife. Outside in the open air, struck by the mildness of the beautiful June morning, he had been unable to collect his scattered ideas, and had come to Nana’s as he always came when in trouble. There only he would abandon himself to his misery, with the cowardly joy of being consoled.","He nodded assent. And a heavy silence fell over the chamber of suffering. The night before, on his return from a party given by the empress, he had received the letter Sabine had written her lover. After an atrocious night passed in the meditation of vengeance he had gone out in the morning in order to resist a longing which prompted him to kill his wife. Outside, under a sudden, sweet influence of a fine June morning, he had lost the thread of his thoughts and had come to Nana's, as he always came at terrible moments in his life. There only he gave way to his misery, for he felt a cowardly joy at the thought that she would console him.","Again he nodded. Once again a heavy silence fell in this bedroom so full of suffering. He’d found Sabine’s letter to her lover yesterday after coming home late from an evening party at the Empress’s. After an agonizing night full of plans of vengeance, he had left home early in order to escape the urge to kill his wife. Outside, the fresh air and the wonderfully mild June morning had so affected his mind that he’d completely lost the thread of his ideas, and he’d gone round to see Nana as he did at all the harrowing moments of his life. Only with her was he able to surrender to his misery and have the cowardly satisfaction of knowing she would comfort him."

"Mais il ne répondit pas. Il parut vouloir relire la chronique. Une sensation de froid coulait de son crâne sur ses épaules. Cette chronique était écrite à la diable, avec des cabrioles de phrases, une outrance de mots imprévus et de rapprochements baroques17. Cependant, il restait frappé par sa lecture, qui, brusquement, venait de réveiller en lui tout ce qu’il n’aimait point à remuer depuis quelques mois.","But he didn't answer. He seemed to want to read the chronicle again. A feeling of cold flowed from his skull to his shoulders. This chronicle was written haphazardly, with antics of phrases, an excess of unforeseen words and bizarre comparisons. However, he remained struck by his reading, which had suddenly awakened in him everything he had not liked to stir up for several months.","But he did not answer. He appeared inclined to read the article over again. A cold shudder passed from his head to his shoulders. The article was written in a most diabolical style, with capering phrases, an excess of unexpected words and strange comparisons. However, he remained very much struck by it; it had abruptly aroused in him all that which, for some months past, he had not cared to disturb.","But he did not answer. It seemed as though he wanted to read the article again. A cold, shivering feeling was creeping from his scalp to his shoulders. This article had been written anyhow. The phrases were wildly extravagant; the unexpected epigrams and quaint collocations of words went beyond all bounds. Yet notwithstanding this, he was struck by what he had read, for it had rudely awakened within him much that for months past he had not cared to think about.","He made no reply. He seemed to be about to reread the article. He could feel an icy sensation running from the top of his skull down to his shoulders. It was a poorly written piece, in jerky phrases, full of queer, extravagant words and outlandish comparisons. All the same, he was struck by it because it had suddenly made him aware of something which he’d been refusing to face for months."

"Vers midi, une nouvelle affreuse avait écrasé madame Hugon. Philippe était en prison de la veille au soir, on l’accusait d’avoir volé douze mille francs à la caisse de son régiment. Depuis trois mois, il détournait de petites sommes, espérant les remettre, dissimulant le déficit par de fausses pièces ; et cette fraude réussissait toujours, grâce aux négligences du conseil d’administration. La vieille dame, atterrée devant le crime de son enfant, eut un premier cri de colère contre Nana ; elle savait la liaison de Philippe, ses tristesses venaient de ce malheur qui la retenait à Paris, dans la crainte d’une catastrophe ; mais jamais elle n’avait redouté tant de honte, et maintenant, elle se reprochait ses refus d’argent comme une complicité. Tombée sur un fauteuil, les jambes prises par la paralysie, elle se sentait inutile, incapable d’une démarche, clouée là pour mourir. Pourtant, la pensée brusque de Georges la consola ; Georges lui restait, il pourrait agir, les sauver peut-être. Alors, sans demander le secours de personne, désirant ensevelir ces choses entre eux, elle se traîna et monta l’étage, rattachée à cette idée qu’elle avait encore une tendresse auprès d’elle. Mais, en haut, elle trouva la chambre vide. Le concierge lui dit que monsieur Georges était sorti de bonne heure. Un second malheur soufflait dans cette chambre ; le lit avec ses draps mordus contait toute une angoisse ; une chaise jetée à terre, parmi des vêtements, semblait morte. Georges devait être chez cette femme. Et madame Hugon, les yeux secs, les jambes fortes, descendit. Elle voulait ses fils, elle partait les réclamer.","Towards noon, terrible news had crushed Madame Hugon. Philippe had been in prison the night before, he was accused of having stolen twelve thousand francs from the cashbox of his regiment. For three months he had been embezzling small sums, hoping to return them, concealing the deficit with counterfeit coins; and this fraud always succeeded, thanks to the negligence of the board of directors. The old lady, overwhelmed by the crime of her child, had a first cry of anger against Nana; she knew of Philippe's liaison, her sadness came from this misfortune which kept her in Paris, in fear of a catastrophe; but she had never feared so much shame, and now she reproached herself for her refusals of money as complicity. Fallen on an armchair, her legs taken by paralysis, she felt useless, unable to move, nailed there to die. However, the abrupt thought of Georges consoled her; Georges was left to him, he could act, perhaps save them. So, without asking for anyone's help, wanting to bury these things between them, she dragged herself up the stairs, attached to this idea that she still had a tenderness for her. But upstairs she found the room empty. The concierge told him that Monsieur Georges had gone out early. A second misfortune was blowing in this room; the bed with its bitten sheets spoke of a whole anguish; a chair thrown to the ground, among clothes, seemed dead. Georges must have been with this woman. And Madame Hugon, her eyes dry, her legs strong, came downstairs. She wanted her sons, she was going to claim them.","Towards midday some shocking news had quite overwhelmed Madame Hugon. Philippe had been in prison since the previous evening, accused of having stolen twelve thousand francs from the regimental chest. For three months past he had been embezzling small sums, hoping to replace them, and hiding the deficit by means of false accounts; and this fraud had succeeded, thanks to the negligence of the managing council. The old lady, crushed by her child’s crime, uttered at first a cry of rage against Nana. She knew of Philippe’s intimacy with the young woman. Her sadness came from this misfortune, which was the cause of her remaining in Paris, through the fear of some catastrophe; but never had she dreaded such shame, and now she reproached herself for having refused him money, as though she had been an accomplice. Having sunk into an arm-chair, her legs, so to say, paralysed, she felt herself useless, incapable of doing anything, only fit to die; but the sudden thought of George consoled her. George was left her—he might do something, perhaps save them both. Then, without asking help from anyone, desirous of hiding all this amongst themselves, she dragged herself along and ascended the stairs, fortified by the thought that she still had one love remaining. But the room above was empty. The door-keeper told her that Monsieur George had gone out early. The signs of a second misfortune hovered about the room. The bed, with its torn and crumpled sheets, told an unmistakable tale of anguish; a chair knocked over on the ground amongst some clothes, seemed to forebode death. George was probably at that woman’s, and Madame Hugon, with dry eyes and a firm step, descended the staircase. She wanted her sons, she was going to demand them.","Toward noon a frightful piece of news had simply crushed Mme Hugon. Philippe had been in prison since the evening of the previous day, accused of having stolen twelve thousand francs from the chest of his regiment. For the last three months he had been withdrawing small sums therefrom in the hope of being able to repay them, while he had covered the deficit with false money. Thanks to the negligence of the administrative committee, this fraud had been constantly successful. The old lady, humbled utterly by her child's crime, had at once cried out in anger against Nana. She knew Philippe's connection with her, and her melancholy had been the result of this miserable state of things which kept her in Paris in constant dread of some final catastrophe. But she had never looked forward to such shame as this, and now she blamed herself for refusing him money, as though such refusal had made her accessory to his act. She sank down on an armchair; her legs were seized with paralysis, and she felt herself to be useless, incapable of action and destined to stay where she was till she died. But the sudden thought of Georges comforted her. Georges was still left her; he would be able to act, perhaps to save them. Thereupon, without seeking aid of anyone else--for she wished to keep these matters shrouded in the bosom of her family--she dragged herself up to the next story, her mind possessed by the idea that she still had someone to love about her. But upstairs she found an empty room. The porter told her that M. Georges had gone out at an early hour. The room was haunted by the ghost of yet another calamity; the bed with its gnawed bedclothes bore witness to someone's anguish, and a chair which lay amid a heap of clothes on the ground looked like something dead. Georges must be at that woman's house, and so with dry eyes and feet that had regained their strength Mme Hugon went downstairs. She wanted her sons; she was starting to reclaim them.","At about noon, Madame Hugon had been shattered by some dreadful news: on the previous day, Philippe had been arrested on the charge of having stolen twelve thousand francs of regimental funds. He had been embezzling small sums of money over the last three months in the hope of returning them at a later date, disguising the shortfall by presenting false accounts; and thanks to the incompetence of the authorities, his fraud had only now been detected. Devastated by her son’s crime, the old lady’s first reaction was anger directed against Nana. She knew of her son’s affair, and this unfortunate situation had been a source of great distress to her, keeping her from leaving Paris for fear of some calamity. But not even her worst fears had led her to imagine such a shameful action, and she was now blaming herself for having kept him so short of money. Her legs gave way under her and she slumped into her armchair, so numbed that she felt completely helpless, paralysed, at death’s door, unable to do anything. But suddenly she felt comforted: Georges at least was still there at her side, he could act and perhaps save the situation. So without calling for help, because the affair must remain a secret, she laboriously dragged herself upstairs, buoyed up by the thought that there was still someone who loved her. Upstairs she found his room empty. The caretaker told her that Georges had gone out early. In the bedroom was the hint of a second tragedy: the bed with its chewed sheets spelled suffering, the chair on the floor, overturned amongst a pile of books, had a deathly look. Georges must be with that woman. So, dry-eyed, Madame Hugon went determinedly downstairs: she wanted her sons and she was on her way to claim them."

"Leurs yeux clignaient, au retour des ombres mystérieuses du jardin ; et ils montrèrent le marquis de Chouard, isolé, dominant de sa haute taille les épaules nues qui l’entouraient. Il avait une face pâle, très sévère, un air de hautaine dignité, sous sa couronne de rares cheveux blancs. Scandalisé par la conduite du comte Muffat, il venait de rompre publiquement, il affectait de ne plus mettre les pieds dans l’hôtel. S’il avait consenti à y paraître, ce soir-là, c’était sur les instances de sa petite-fille, dont il désapprouvait d’ailleurs le mariage, avec des paroles indignées contre la désorganisation des classes dirigeantes par les honteux compromis de la débauche moderne.","Their eyes blinked at the return of the mysterious shadows of the garden; and they showed the Marquis de Chouard, isolated, towering tall over the bare shoulders which surrounded him. He had a pale, very stern face, an air of haughty dignity, beneath his crown of scanty white hair.

If he had consented to appear there that evening, it was at the behest of his granddaughter, whose marriage he moreover disapproved of, with words of indignation against the disorganization of the ruling classes by the shameful compromises of modern debauchery.","Their eyes blinked on coming from out of the mysterious shadows of the garden; and they drew each other’s attention to the Marquis de Chouard, who, standing all alone, and stretched to the full height of his tall figure, overlooked the bare shoulders around him. His pale face appeared very severe, and bore an expression of haughty dignity beneath his crown of scanty white locks. Scandalized by Count Muffat’s conduct, he had publicly broken off all connection with him, and affected not to visit at the house. If he had consented to appear on this occasion, it was on account of the earnest entreaties of his grand-daughter, whose marriage, however, he disapproved of in indignant language against the disorganisation of the upper classes by the shameful compromises of modern debauchery.","They blinked after emerging from the mysterious shadows of the garden. Then they pointed out to one another the Marquis de Chouard where he stood apart, his tall figure towering over the bare shoulders which surrounded him.

Scandalized by Count Muffat's conduct, he had publicly broken off all intercourse with him and was by way of never again setting foot in the house. If he had consented to put in an appearance that evening it was because his granddaughter had begged him to. But he disapproved of her marriage and had inveighed indignantly against the way in which the government classes were being disorganized by the shameful compromises engendered by modern debauchery.","Having just emerged from the darkness outside, they found themselves blinking. They now noticed the tall figure of the Marquis de Chouard, standing by himself and towering over the bare shoulders all around him. He was pale and looked severe, dignified, and haughty with his crown of sparse white hair. He’d been so shocked by his son’s behaviour that he’d recently broken off relations with him and was making a point of not setting foot in his house. It was only because his granddaughter had begged him to come that he’d agreed to be there that evening, despite his indignant objection to her marriage which, in his eyes, reflected the decline of the ruling classes brought about by their shameful compromises with the debauchery of modern life."

"Cependant, la Faloise, ayant entendu les quelques paroles rapides, échangées à demi-voix, regardait Fauchery, espérant une explication, qui ne vint pas. De qui parlait-on ? que faisait-on, le lendemain, à minuit ? Il ne lâcha plus son cousin. Celui-ci était allé s’asseoir. La comtesse Sabine surtout l’intéressait. On avait souvent prononcé son nom devant lui, il savait que, mariée à dix-sept ans, elle devait en avoir trente-quatre, et qu’elle menait depuis son mariage une existence cloîtrée, entre son mari et sa belle-mère. Dans le monde, les uns la disaient d’une froideur de dévote, les autres la plaignaient, en rappelant ses beaux rires, ses grands yeux de flamme, avant qu’on l’enfermât au fond de ce vieil hôtel. Fauchery l’examinait et hésitait. Un de ses amis, mort récemment capitaine au Mexique15, lui avait, la veille même de son départ, au sortir de table, fait une de ces confidences brutales que les hommes les plus discrets laissent échapper à de certains moments. Mais ses souvenirs restaient vagues ; ce soir-là, on avait bien dîné ; et il doutait, en voyant la comtesse au milieu de ce salon antique, vêtue de noir, avec son tranquille sourire. Une lampe, placée derrière elle, détachait son fin profil de brune potelée, où la bouche seule, un peu épaisse, mettait une sorte de sensualité impérieuse.","However, La Faloise, having heard the few rapid words exchanged in a low voice, looked at Fauchery, hoping for an explanation, which did not come. Who were we talking about? what were we doing the next day at midnight? He never let go of his cousin. He had gone to sit down. The Countess Sabine especially interested him. Her name had often been mentioned in front of him, he knew that, married at seventeen, she must have been thirty-four, and that since her marriage she had led a cloistered existence, between her husband and her mother-in-law. In society, some spoke of her with a devout coldness, others pitied her, recalling her beautiful laughter, her great burning eyes, before they locked her up in the back of that old hotel. Fauchery examined him and hesitated. One of his friends, who had recently died as a captain in Mexico,15 had, the very day before his departure, on leaving the table, made one of those brutal confidences that the most discreet men let slip at certain times. But his memories remained vague; that evening we had dined well; and he doubted, seeing the Countess in the middle of this ancient drawing-room, dressed in black, with her calm smile. A lamp, placed behind her, detached her slender profile of chubby brunette, in which the mouth alone, a little thick, gave off a sort of imperious sensuality.","La Faloise, however, having overheard the few rapid words exchanged in a low voice between the two friends, looked at Fauchery, hoping for an explanation which came not. Whom were they talking of? What was going to take place the next day at midnight? He stuck to his cousin wherever he went. The latter had gone and sat down. Countess Sabine especially interested him. She had often been talked about in his presence. He knew that, married when she was only seventeen, she would then be thirty-four, and that ever since her marriage she had led a sort of cloistered existence between her husband and her mother-in-law. In society, some said she was as cold as a devotee, but others pitied her as they recalled her merry laughter, her big, sparkling eyes, in the days before she was shut up in that old house. Fauchery examined her and hesitated. One of his friends, a captain who had been recently killed in Mexico, y had imparted to him after dinner, on the eve of his departure, one of those brutal secrets which the most discreet men let out at certain moments. But Fauchery’s recollection of the matter was very vague; they had both dined well that evening, and he had his doubts as he watched the countess, dressed in black, with her quiet smile, in the middle of that old-fashioned drawing-room. A lamp placed behind her detached her sharp profile, that of a plump brunette, of which the lips alone, slightly thick, had a sort of imperious sensuality.","La Faloise meanwhile had heard the few rapid sentences thus whisperingly interchanged, and he gazed at Fauchery in hopes of an explanation which was not vouchsafed him. Of whom were they talking, and what were they going to do at midnight tomorrow? He did not leave his cousin's side again. The latter had gone and seated himself. He was especially interested by the Countess Sabine. Her name had often been mentioned in his presence, and he knew that, having been married at the age of seventeen, she must now be thirty-four and that since her marriage she had passed a cloistered existence with her husband and her mother-in-law. In society some spoke of her as a woman of religious chastity, while others pitied her and recalled to memory her charming bursts of laughter and the burning glances of her great eyes in the days prior to her imprisonment in this old town house. Fauchery scrutinized her and yet hesitated. One of his friends, a captain who had recently died in Mexico, had, on the very eve of his departure, made him one of those gross postprandial confessions, of which even the most prudent among men are occasionally guilty. But of this he only retained a vague recollection; they had dined not wisely but too well that evening, and when he saw the countess, in her black dress and with her quiet smile, seated in that Old World drawing room, he certainly had his doubts. A lamp which had been placed behind her threw into clear relief her dark, delicate, plump side face, wherein a certain heaviness in the contours of the mouth alone indicated a species of imperious sensuality.","Meanwhile la Faloise had overheard the whispered exchange and was looking at Fauchery, hoping for an explanation, which was not forthcoming. Whom were they referring to? What would they be doing at midnight tomorrow? He kept close to his cousin, who had taken a seat. Fauchery was particularly interested in Countess Sabine. He’d often heard her name mentioned and knew that she’d been married at 17 and must now be 34, and during that time had been living a cloistered life between her husband and her mother-in-law. Some people in her set thought she was rigidly pious and others felt sympathy for her, remembering her cheerfulness and laughter, the glow in her large, dark eyes, before she’d been shut up in the depths of this old mansion. Fauchery was eyeing her uncertainly. On one occasion a captain friend of his, just a day before sailing for Mexico* where he’d died quite recently, had blurted out, after a farewell meal, the sort of crude admission which even the most discreet of men sometimes let slip. But his recollection was a trifle blurred; it had been after a very good dinner; and looking at the countess in this venerable drawing-room, in her black dress and with her relaxed smile, he had his doubts. She was plump and dark, with delicate features which he could see in profile against the lamp behind her; only her mouth, with its rather thick lips, hinted at a compulsive sensuality."
"Cependant, Fauchery était revenu, amené par son cousin. Ce malheureux Fauchery, à cette heure, avait un ménage. Après avoir rompu avec la comtesse, il se trouvait aux mains de Rose, qui usait de lui comme d’un mari véritable46. Mignon demeurait simplement le majordome de madame. Installé en maître, le journaliste mentait à Rose, prenait toutes sortes de précautions, lorsqu’il la trompait, plein des scrupules d’un bon époux désireux de se ranger enfin. Le triomphe de Nana fut de l’avoir et de lui manger un journal, qu’il avait fondé avec l’argent d’un ami ; elle ne l’affichait pas, se plaisait au contraire à le traiter en monsieur qui doit se cacher ; et, quand elle parlait de Rose, elle disait « cette pauvre Rose ». Le journal lui donna des fleurs pendant deux mois ; elle avait des abonnés en province, elle prenait tout, depuis la chronique jusqu’aux échos de théâtre ; puis, après avoir essoufflé la rédaction, disloqué l’admi-nistration, elle contenta un gros caprice, un jardin d’hiver dans un coin de son hôtel, qui emporta l’imprimerie. D’ailleurs, c’était simplement histoire de plaisanter. Quand Mignon, heureux de l’aventure, accourut voir s’il ne pourrait pas lui coller Fauchery tout à fait, elle demanda s’il se moquait d’elle : un gaillard sans le sou, vivant de ses articles et de ses pièces, non par exemple ! Cette bêtise-là était bonne pour une femme de talent comme cette pauvre Rose. Et, se méfiant, craignant quelque traîtrise de la part de Mignon, très capable de les dénoncer à sa femme, elle congédia Fauchery, qui ne la payait plus qu’en publicité.","However, Fauchery had returned, brought by his cousin. This unfortunate Fauchery, at this hour, had a household. After breaking with the Countess, he found himself in the hands of Rose, who used him as a real husband. Mignon simply remained Madame's butler. Installed as a master, the journalist lied to Rose, took all sorts of precautions when he cheated on her, full of the scruples of a good husband eager to finally settle down. Nana's triumph was to have him and eat him a newspaper, which he had founded with the money of a friend; she did not display him, on the contrary liked to treat him as a gentleman who must hide; and when she spoke of Rose, she said ""that poor Rose."" The newspaper gave her flowers for two months; she had subscribers in the provinces, she took everything, from chronicles to echoes of the theatre; then, after exhausting the editorial staff and dislocating the administration, she contented herself with a big caprice, a winter garden in a corner of her hotel, which took away the printing office. Besides, it was just a joke. When Mignon, happy with the adventure, came running to see if he couldn't stick Fauchery to her completely, she asked if he was making fun of her: a penniless fellow, living off his articles and his coins, not for example! That nonsense was good for a woman of talent like that poor Rose. And, being suspicious, fearing some treachery on the part of Mignon, very capable of denouncing them to his wife, she dismissed Fauchery, who only paid her in publicity.","Fauchery, however, had returned, brought by his cousin. The unfortunate Fauchery at this time had become quite a family man. After breaking off with the countess, he found himself in the hands of Rose, who treated him as a real husband. Mignon simply remained madame’s major-domo. Installed as master, the journalist used to lie to Rose, and, whenever he deceived her, had to take all sorts of precautions, full of the scruples of a good spouse desirous of at length settling down. Nana’s triumph was to hook him and to devour a newspaper he had started with the money of one of his friends. She did not openly go about with him. She took a delight, on the contrary, in treating him as a gentleman who must conceal his movements; and whenever she spoke of Rose, she would say “that poor Rose.” The newspaper supplied her with flowers for a couple of months. She had subscribers in the country. She took everything, from the leading article to the theatrical notes. Then, after wearing out the editors, dislocating the management, she satisfied one of her big caprices—a winter garden in a corner of her mansion—which carried off the printing establishment. It was merely by way of amusement, however. When Mignon, delighted with what was taking place, hastened to see if he could not fix Fauchery on her for good, she asked him if he was poking fun at her—a fellow without a sou, living on his articles and his plays; not if she knew it! Such stupidity was only worthy of a woman of talent like that poor Rose; and, full of mistrust, fearing some underhand dealing on Mignon’s part, who was quite capable of denouncing them to his wife, she dismissed Fauchery, who for some time had only been paying her in advertisements.","Meanwhile Fauchery had returned, his cousin having brought him. Poor Fauchery had now set up housekeeping. After having thrown over the countess he had fallen into Rose's hands, and she treated him as a lawful wife would have done. Mignon was simply Madame's major- domo. Installed as master of the house, the journalist lied to Rose and took all sorts of precautions when he deceived her. He was as scrupulous as a good husband, for he really wanted to settle down at last. Nana's triumph consisted in possessing and in ruining a newspaper that he had started with a friend's capital. She did not proclaim her triumph; on the contrary, she delighted in treating him as a man who had to be circumspect, and when she spoke of Rose it was as ""poor Rose. "" The newspaper kept her in flowers for two months. She took all the provincial subscriptions; in fact, she took everything, from the column of news and gossip down to the dramatic notes. Then the editorial staff having been turned topsy- turvy and the management completely disorganized, she satisfied a fanciful caprice and had a winter garden constructed in a corner of her house: that carried off all the type. But then it was no joke after all! When in his delight at the whole business Mignon came to see if he could not saddle Fauchery on her altogether, she asked him if he took her for a fool. A penniless fellow living by his articles and his plays--not if she knew it! That sort of foolishness might be all very well for a clever woman like her poor, dear Rose! She grew distrustful: she feared some treachery on Mignon's part, for he was quite capable of preaching to his wife, and so she gave Fauchery his CONGE as he now only paid her in fame.","Meanwhile Fauchery had come back, brought round by his cousin. Poor Fauchery was now caught up in domesticity: after breaking with the countess, he’d fallen into the hands of Rose, who treated him as her real husband; Mignon was merely her ladyship’s factotum. Since he’d become head of the family, every time the journalist went to bed with other women he was obliged to lie to Rose and take careful precautions, like some scrupulous, good-hearted husband intending to settle down in the end. Nana’s great achievement was to lay hands on him and gobble up a newspaper of his which he’d set up with money from a friend. She didn’t flaunt herself with him in public, in fact she enjoyed treating him as a man who needs to stay in the background. Whenever she mentioned Rose, she referred to her as ‘poor old Rose’. Fauchery’s paper set her up in flowers for a couple of months; she had subscribers in the country; she took the lot, from feature news-reports to theatre gossip-columns; then, having run the staff off its legs and thrown its whole management into chaos, she satisfied a major whim of hers, a water-garden in part of her house in the Avenue de Villiers; this put paid to the printing-press. In any case, the whole thing was just a joke. When Mignon, delighted at the affair, hurried round to see if he couldn’t persuade her to take Fauchery over completely, she asked him if he was pulling her leg: a fellow without a penny to his name, making a living from his articles and plays? Definitely not! That sort of silliness was good enough for a talented woman like ‘poor old Rose’. She became suspicious that Mignon might try to play some dirty trick on her, such as splitting on them to his wife. And, as Fauchery’s only means of paying her now was by giving her publicity in his articles, she gave him the sack."

"Dans la chambre à coucher, il força encore la note aimable. D’ordinaire, il traitait les femmes de chameaux, et l’idée qu’un homme pouvait s’embarrasser d’une de ces sales bêtes soulevait, chez lui, la seule indignation dont il était capable, dans le dédain d’ivrogne dont il enveloppait le monde.","In the bedroom, he again forced the amiable note. Ordinarily he called women camels, and the idea that a man could embarrass himself with one of these dirty beasts aroused in him the only indignation of which he was capable, in the drunken disdain of which it enveloped the world.","In the bedroom he seemed scarcely able to find sufficient words to express his admiration. Usually he alluded to women as being no better than animals, and the idea that a man could embarrass himself with one of the dirty hussies raised in him the only indignation of which he was capable, in the drunken disdain with which he enveloped the world.","In the bedroom he harped still more vigorously on the amiable note. Ordinarily he was wont to treat women like cattle, and the idea of a man bothering himself about one of the dirty brutes excited within him the only angry feelings of which, in his comprehensive, drunken disdain of the universe, he was still capable.","In the bedroom he made an even greater fuss. Normally he referred to women as cows and in the cynical, drunken haze through which he viewed the world the only thing capable of arousing his indignation was the thought of a man lumbering himself with one of the beastly breed."
"Il promena Muffat devant les casiers, dans le jour verdâtre qui venait de la cour, lui nommant les ustensiles, voulant l’intéresser à son inventaire de chiffonnier, comme il disait en riant.

Then, when they had worked their way round to where Fauchery stood, he said, in an easy tone of voice,","He walked Muffat round in front of the pigeonholes and shelves and in the greenish light which filtered through the courtyard, told him the names of different properties, for he was anxious to interest him in his marine-stores inventory, as he jocosely termed it.

"Les fils Hugon passaient, Philippe le fit taire. Alors, entre hommes, on causa du mariage. Georges se fâcha contre la Faloise, qui racontait l’histoire. Nana avait bien collé à Muffat un de ses anciens pour gendre ; seulement, il était faux que, la veille encore, elle eût couché avec Daguenet. Foucarmont se permit de hausser les épaules. Savait-on jamais quand Nana couchait avec quelqu’un ? Mais Georges, emporté, répondit par un : « Moi, monsieur, je le sais ! » qui les mit tous en gaieté. Enfin, comme le dit Steiner, ça faisait toujours une drôle de cuisine.","The Hugon boys passed by, Philippe silenced him. Then, among men, we talked about marriage. Georges got angry with La Faloise, who was telling the story. Nana had stuck to Muffat for one of her elders for a son-in-law; only, it was false that, just the day before, she had slept with Daguenet. Foucarmont allowed himself to shrug his shoulders. Did you ever know when Nana slept with someone? But Georges, carried away, replied with: ""I, sir, I know it!"" which made them all happy. Well, as Steiner says, it always made for funny cooking.","The two Hugons passed just then, and Philippe made him desist. Then, as men, they talked of the marriage. George became very incensed with La Faloise, who related the story of it. Nana had indeed saddled Muffat with one of her former lovers for a son-in-law, only it was untrue that she had had Daguenet to see her the night before. Foucarmont incredulously shrugged his shoulders. Did any one ever know whom Nana had to see her of a night? But George angrily replied with a “Sir, I know!” which made them all laugh. Anyhow, as Steiner said, it was a very peculiar state of affairs.","The young Hugons were passing, and Philippe silenced him. And with that they chatted about the marriage from the male point of view. Georges was vexed with La Faloise for telling an anecdote. Certainly Nana had fubbed off on Muffat one of her old flames as son-in-law; only it was not true that she had been to bed with Daguenet as lately as yesterday. Foucarmont made bold to shrug his shoulders. Could anyone ever tell when Nana was in bed with anyone? But Georges grew excited and answered with an ""I can tell, sir!"" which set them all laughing. In a word, as Steiner put it, it was all a very funny kettle of fish!","At this moment the Hugon brothers came up; Philippe told him to shut up. They started to talk about the marriage, in the way men do. La Faloise told his version of the story, which made Georges cross. Nana had certainly landed Muffat with one of her old flames as son-in-law, but it wasn’t true that she’d gone to bed with Daguenet the day before. Foucarmont shrugged his shoulders: who could ever tell who Nana was going to bed with? Georges now became even crosser and snapped: ‘Excuse me, sir, but I can!’, which everybody found highly amusing. In any case, as Steiner pointed out, the whole set-up was very odd."

"Dans les couloirs, on bousculait les ouvreuses qui perdaient la tête parmi des tas de vêtements écroulés. Fauchery et la Faloise s’étaient hâtés pour assister à la sortie. Le long du vestibule, des hommes faisaient la haie, tandis que, du double escalier, lentement, deux interminables queues descendaient, régulières et compactes. Steiner, entraîné par Mignon, avait filé des premiers. Le comte de Vandeuvres partit avec Blanche de Sivry à son bras. Un instant, Gaga et sa fille semblèrent embarrassées, mais Labordette s’empressa d’aller leur chercher une voiture dont il referma galamment la portière sur elles. Personne ne vit passer Daguenet. Comme l’échappé de collège, les joues brûlantes, décidé à attendre devant la porte des artistes, courait au passage des Panoramas110, dont il trouva la grille fermée, Satin, debout sur le trottoir, vint le frôler de ses jupes ; mais lui, désespéré, refusa brutalement, puis disparut au milieu de la foule avec des larmes de désir et d’impuissance dans les yeux. Des spectateurs allumaient des cigares, s’éloignaient en fredonnant : « Lorsque Vénus rôde le soir... » Satin était remontée devant le café des Variétés, où Auguste lui laissait manger le reste de sucre des consommations. Un gros homme, qui sortait très échauffé, l’emmena enfin, dans l’ombre du boulevard peu à peu endormi.","In the corridors, we jostled the ushers who were losing their heads among piles of fallen clothes. Fauchery and La Faloise had hastened to attend the sortie. Along the vestibule, men lined up, while from the double staircase, slowly, two interminable queues descended, regular and compact. Steiner, trained by Mignon, had spun first. The Comte de Vandeuvres left with Blanche de Sivry on his arm. For a moment, Gaga and her daughter seemed embarrassed, but Labordette hastened to fetch them a car and gallantly closed the door behind them. No one saw Daguenet pass. As the college dropout, with burning cheeks, determined to wait in front of the artists' door, ran to the Passage des Panoramas,110 of which he found the gate closed, Satin, standing on the sidewalk, came and brushed him with her skirts; but he, in despair, bluntly refused, then disappeared into the middle of the crowd with tears of desire and helplessness in his eyes. Spectators were lighting cigars and walking away humming: ""When Venus prowls in the evening..."" Satin had gone up to the Café des Variétés, where Auguste let her eat the rest of the sugar from the drinks. A fat man, who came out very excited, finally led him away, into the shade of the boulevard, which was gradually falling asleep.","In the passages the jostled attendants were fast losing their senses among the piles of cloaks and other garments. Fauchery and La Faloise had hurried to see the people come out. In the vestibule several gentlemen were waiting in a row, while down the double staircase descended two interminable and compact processions. Steiner, led away by Mignon, was one of the first to leave. The Count de Vandeuvres went off with Blanche de Sivry on his arm. For a moment, Gaga and her daughter seemed embarrassed, but Labordette hastened to secure them a cab, and gallantly saw them into it. No one noticed Daguenet leave. As the youngster fresh from college, with his cheeks all aglow, bent upon waiting at the stage door, hastened to the Passage des Panoramas,p the gate of which he found closed, Satin, loitering on the pavement, came and grazed him lightly with her skirts; but he, quite broken-hearted, roughly declined her advances, and disappeared in the crowd, with tears of powerless longing in his eyes. Some of the spectators, lighting cigars, went off humming the song—“When Venus takes an evening stroll.” Satin had returned to the Café des Variétés, where Augustus was allowing her to eat the lumps of sugar left by the customers. A stout man, who was greatly excited, having just quitted the theatre, at length took her off into the darkness of the now gradually hushed Boulevard.","In the passages the people were jostling the attendants, who hardly knew what to do among the tumbled heaps of outdoor raiment. Fauchery and La Faloise had hurried in order to see the crowd pass out. All along the entrance hall men formed a living hedge, while down the double staircase came slowly and in regular, complete formation two interminable throngs of human beings. Steiner, in tow of Mignon, had left the house among the foremost. The Count de Vandeuvres took his departure with Blanche de Sivry on his arm. For a moment or two Gaga and her daughter seemed doubtful how to proceed, but Labordette made haste to go and fetch them a conveyance, the door whereof he gallantly shut after them. Nobody saw Daguenet go by. As the truant schoolboy, registering a mental vow to wait at the stage door, was running with burning cheeks toward the Passage des Panoramas, of which he found the gate closed, Satin, standing on the edge of the pavement, moved forward and brushed him with her skirts, but he in his despair gave her a savage refusal and vanished amid the crowd, tears of impotent desire in his eyes. Members of the audience were lighting their cigars and walking off, humming: When Venus roams at eventide. Satin had gone back in front of the Cafe des Varietes, where Auguste let her eat the sugar that remained over from the customers' orders. A stout man, who came out in a very heated condition, finally carried her off in the shadow of the boulevard, which was now gradually going to sleep.","In the corridors, the frantic cloakroom attendants were being jostled amidst piles of clothes that had fallen on the floor. Fauchery and la Faloise had hurried away to watch the people coming out. Men were standing along the walls of the entrance-lobby, while two solid, endless streams of people were slowly and steadily making their way down the double staircase. Steiner had been carried off by Mignon, who was amongst the first to get away. Count de Vandeuvres went off, giving his arm to Blanche de Sivry. For a moment Gaga and her daughter seemed embarrassed, but Labordette quickly went to find them a carriage and politely closed the door after they’d got in. Daguenet was nowhere to be seen. As the schoolboy cherub, red in the face and determined to wait outside the stage-door, made a dash for the Passage des Panoramas, where he found the entrance locked, Satin, who was standing on the pavement, brushed against him with her skirt; he abruptly refused and disappeared despairingly into the crowd, his eyes full of tears of frustrated desire. Some of the audience were lighting up cigars and going off humming: ‘When Venus goes prowling at night.’ Satin had gone away to the Café des Variétés, where Auguste was letting her help herself to the lumps of sugar left by the customers. Finally, a large man who’d come out in a state of considerable elation went off with her along the dark boulevard, which had gradually gone to sleep."

Mais, depuis quelques minutes, Rose et Fauchery, qui causaient de très près, l’agaçaient. Rose, peut-être, n’allait pas perdre son temps à une pareille sottise.

Et elle gardait quand même ce trou d’oisiveté bête, qui lui donnait comme des crampes d’estomac.

And she still kept this hole of stupid idleness, which gave her stomach cramps. In spite of the continual fits in her heart, she stretched out her arms as soon as she was alone, in a gesture of immense fatigue. The loneliness saddened her right away, because she found herself there with the emptiness and the boredom of herself.

But she still retained that empty feeling of stupid idleness, which gave her pains in her inside. In spite of the constant infatuations in which her heart indulged, she would stretch her arms the moment she was alone, with a gesture of immense fatigue. Solitude made her sad at once, for she found herself again with the empty feeling, and the tedium of her own society. Very gay by profession and by nature, she would then become lugubrious, and would constantly sum up her life in this cry, between two yawns,","On the days when her child did not engross attention Nana would again sink back into the noisy monotony of her existence, with its drives in the Bois, first nights at the theater, dinners and suppers at the Maison-d'Or or the Cafe Anglais, not to mention all the places of public resort, all the spectacles to which crowds rushed-- Mabille, the reviews, the races. But whatever happened she still felt that stupid, idle void, which caused her, as it were, to suffer internal cramps. Despite the incessant infatuations that possessed her heart, she would stretch out her arms with a gesture of immense weariness the moment she was left alone. Solitude rendered her low spirited at once, for it brought her face to face with the emptiness and boredom within her.

And still this feeling of vacuous, stupid, idleness which gave her a kind of cramp in the stomach. Her frequent passing infatuations did little to relieve her boredom; as soon as she was left to her own devices, she’d yawn and stretch her arms in utter weariness, for being alone made her sad because she came face to face with the hollowness of her life and her own tedium. Although cheerful by nature and the demands of her profession, she’d relapse into deep gloom and between yawns would sum up her existence in one constant wail:"

Besides, when all's said and done, it's annoying, for I can quite see they seem to think me uneducated. Well, my boy, they're jolly well in the dark about it, I can tell you! When I want to be a perfect lady, why then I am a swell, and no mistake! Just look at this.""","‘That Duchess Hélène, of course! If they think I’m going to play Géraldine, they’ve got another think coming! It’s a potty little part, only one scene and not much of that! … Anyway, that’s not the point. I’m fed up with tarts. Nothing but tarts, you’d think that was the only thing I’m capable of playing. It’s become really irritating because it’s obvious they seem to think I’m common … Well, old boy, they’re barking up the wrong tree! When I want to be, I can be as distinguished as anyone … Take a look at this.’"
"« Par exemple, j’étais jeune, reprit Gaga. N’importe, je me souviens, je la voyais passer... On la disait dégoûtante chez elle. Mais, dans sa voiture, elle vous avait un chic ! Et des histoires épatantes, des saletés et des roublardises à crever... Ça ne m’étonne pas, si elle a un château. Elle vous nettoyait un homme, rien qu’à souffler dessus... Ah ! Irma d’Anglars vit encore ! Eh bien, mes petites chattes, elle doit aller dans les quatre-vingt-dix ans. »","""For example, I was young,"" Gaga said. No matter, I remember, I saw her pass... They said she was disgusting at home. But, in her car, she had a chic with you! And amazing stories, filth and cunning to die for... It doesn't surprise me if she has a castle. She cleaned a man for you, just by blowing on it. Ah! Irma d'Anglars still lives! Well, my little cats, she must be in her nineties. »","“I was very young, then,” resumed Gaga. “All the same, I recollect I used to see her pass. It was said that she was something disgusting at home, but in her carriage she was magnificent! And the most incredible stories circulated—such filthy goings-on that it’s a marvel she ever lived through them. It doesn’t surprise me that she has a château. She could clear a man out as easy as breathe on him. Ah! Irma d’Anglars is still among the living! Well, my little friends, she must be about ninety now.”","""Dear me, I was young then,"" continued Gaga. ""But never mind, I remember it all. I saw her pass. They said she was disgusting in her own house, but, driving in her carriage, she WAS just smart! And the stunning tales about her! Dirty doings and money flung about like one o'clock! I don't wonder at all that she's got a fine place. Why, she used to clean out a man's pockets as soon as look at him. Irma d'Anglars still in the land of the living! Why, my little pets, she must be near ninety.""","‘Well, naturally I was very young’, Gaga continued. ‘All the same, I can recollect her, I saw her going by… People said that in her home she was disgusting, but in her carriage you can’t imagine how smart she looked! And there were all sorts of amazing stories about dirty tricks and swindles that would make you die with laughing… I’m not surprised she’s got a château. She’d clean a man out in two shakes of a lamb’s tail… So Irma’s still alive! Well, duckies, she must be getting on for 90!’"

"Il voulut plaisanter. Elle s’éloigna d’un air de reine. Clarisse, qui s’était adossée contre un mur afin de boire tranquillement un verre de kirsch, haussait les épaules.

"Ce mardi, vers dix heures, il y avait à peine une douzaine de personnes dans le salon. Lorsqu’elle n’attendait que des intimes, la comtesse n’ouvrait ni le petit salon ni la salle à manger.

Le salon, d’ailleurs, était très grand, très haut ; quatre fenêtres donnaient sur le jardin, dont on sentait l’humidité par cette pluvieuse soirée de la fin d’avril, malgré les fortes bûches qui brûlaient dans la cheminée. Jamais le soleil ne descendait là ; le jour, une clarté verdâtre éclairait à peine la pièce ; mais, le soir, quand les lampes et le lustre étaient allumés, elle n’était plus que grave, avec ses meubles Empire 3 d’acajou massif, ses tentures et ses sièges de velours jaune, à larges dessins satinés.

The sun never went down there; during the day, a greenish light barely illuminated the room; but in the evening, when the lamps and the chandelier were lighted, it was only serious, with its Empire 3 furniture of solid mahogany, its hangings and seats of yellow velvet with large satin designs.

"Une rotonde s’ouvrait, entre des pelouses bordées de jeunes marronniers ; et là, formant un vaste cercle, abrités sous les feuilles d’un vert tendre, une ligne serrée de bookmakers attendaient les parieurs45, comme dans une foire. Pour dominer la foule, ils se haussaient sur des bancs de bois ; ils affichaient leurs cotes près d’eux, contre les arbres ; tandis que, l’œil au guet, ils inscrivaient des paris, sur un geste, sur un clignement de paupières, si rapidement, que des curieux, béants, les regardaient sans comprendre. C'était une confusion, des chiffres criés, des tumultes accueillant les changements de cote inattendus. Et, par moments, redoublant le tapage, des avertisseurs débouchaient en courant, s’arrêtaient à l’entrée de la rotonde, jetaient violemment un cri, un départ, une arrivée, qui soulevait de longues rumeurs, dans cette fièvre du jeu battant au soleil.","A rotunda opened between lawns lined with young chestnut trees; and there, forming a vast circle, sheltered under the soft green leaves, a tight line of bookmakers awaited the bettors,45 as at a fair. To dominate the crowd, they raised themselves on wooden benches; they displayed their odds close to them, against the trees; while, with watchful eyes, they placed bets, with a gesture, with a blink of the eyelids, so quickly that the curious, gaping, looked at them without understanding. It was a confusion, numbers shouted, tumults welcoming unexpected rating changes. And, at times, doubling the din, horns came running out, stopped at the entrance to the rotunda, uttered a violent cry, a departure, an arrival, which raised long rumors, in this fever of the game beating at the sun.","In an open space composed of a series of grass plots bordered by young chestnut trees, and shaded by tender green leaves, a compact line of bookmakers, forming a vast circle, as though at a fair, awaited those desirous of betting. In order to overlook the crowd, they were standing on wooden benches. They had posted up their betting lists against the trees; whilst, with an eye ever on the watch, they at the least sign made notes of bets so rapidly that some of the spectators gazed at them with open mouths and without comprehending. All was confusion, odds were shouted out, and exclamations greeted the unexpected changes in the prices; and now and again, increasing the hub-bub, scouts running at full speed would arrive and call out at the top of their voices the news of a start or a finish, which would raise a long murmur midst all that fever for gambling beneath the shining sun.","Amid lawns bordered by young horse-chestnut trees there was a round open enclosure, where, forming a vast circle under the shadow of the tender green leaves, a dense line of bookmakers was waiting for betting men, as though they had been hucksters at a fair. In order to overtop and command the surrounding crowd they had taken up positions on wooden benches, and they were advertising their prices on the trees beside them. They had an ever-vigilant glance, and they booked wagers in answer to a single sign, a mere wink, so rapidly that certain curious onlookers watched them openmouthed, without being able to understand it all. Confusion reigned; prices were shouted, and any unexpected change in a quotation was received with something like tumult. Occasionally scouts entered the place at a run and redoubled the uproar as they stopped at the entrance to the rotunda and, at the tops of their voices, announced departures and arrivals. In this place, where the gambling fever was pulsing in the sunshine, such announcements were sure to raise a prolonged muttering sound.","There was a round, open space set between lawns bordered by young chestnut trees with fresh green leaves, under which she saw a row of bookmakers packed tightly together, waiting as if on a fairground for people to come and lay their bets.

They were keeping a sharp look-out, picking up a wink here or a signal there and writing down the bets so fast that the curious spectators watching open-mouthed couldn’t understand what was happening. There was confusion everywhere, figures were being shouted out, and any sudden change in the odds produced an uproar; adding to the din were men running up to the edge of the ring and yelling bits of information, an announcement of a start or a finish which raised a long buzz of excitement from the punters feverishly crowding together in the sun."

"Un long frémissement secouait la foule, pendant qu’une nouvelle volée de la cloche annonçait l’arrivée des chevaux sur la piste. Alors, Nana, pour bien voir, monta debout sur la banquette de son landau, foulant aux pieds les bouquets, les myosotis et les roses. D’un regard circulaire, elle embrassait l’horizon immense. À cette heure dernière de fièvre, c’était d’abord la piste vide, fermée de ses barrières grises, où s’alignaient des sergents de ville, de deux en deux poteaux ; et la bande d’herbe, boueuse devant elle, s’en allait reverdie, tournait au loin en un tapis de velours tendre. Puis, au centre, en baissant les yeux, elle voyait la pelouse51, toute grouillante d’une foule haussée sur les pieds, accrochée aux voitures, soulevée et heurtée dans un coup de passion, avec les chevaux qui hennissaient, les toiles des tentes qui claquaient, les cavaliers qui lançaient leurs bêtes, parmi les piétons courant s’accouder aux barrières52, tandis que, de l’autre côté, quand elle se tournait vers les tribunes, les figures se rapetissaient, les masses profondes de têtes n’étaient plus qu’un bariolage emplissant les allées, les gradins, les terrasses, où un entassement de profils noirs se détachait dans le ciel. Et, au-delà encore, autour de l’Hippodrome, elle dominait la plaine. Derrière le moulin couvert de lierre, à droite, il y avait un enfoncement de prairies, coupées de grands ombrages ; en face, jusqu’à la Seine, coulant au bas du coteau, se croisaient des avenues de parc, où attendaient des files immobiles d’équipages ; puis, vers Boulogne, à gauche, le pays, élargi de nouveau, ouvrait une trouée sur les lointains bleuâtres de Meudon, que barrait une allée de paulownias53, dont les têtes roses, sans une feuille, faisaient une nappe de laque vive. Du monde arrivait toujours, une traînée de fourmilière venait de là-bas, par le mince ruban d’un chemin, à travers les terres ; pendant que, très loin, du côté de Paris, le public qui ne payait pas, un troupeau campant dans les futaies, mettait une ligne mouvante de points sombres, au ras du Bois, sous les arbres.","A long shudder shook the crowd, while another peal of the bell announced the arrival of the horses on the track. So Nana, to see clearly, got up on the seat of her pram, trampling the bouquets, the forget-me-nots and the roses. With a circular gaze, she embraced the immense horizon. At this last hour of fever, it was first the empty track, closed with its gray barriers, where the sergents de ville were lined up, two by two posts; and the strip of grass, muddy in front of her, turned green again, turning in the distance into a carpet of soft velvet. Then, in the middle, lowering her eyes, she saw the lawn,51 teeming with a crowd on their feet, clinging to cars, lifted and knocked in a fit of passion, with the horses neighing, the canvases of the tents chattered, the riders who launched their beasts, among the pedestrians running to lean on the barriers,52 while, on the other side, when she turned towards the stands, the faces grew smaller, the deep masses of heads were no longer only a variegation filling the aisles, the steps, the terraces, where a heap of black profiles stood out against the sky. And beyond that, around the Hippodrome, it dominated the plain. Behind the ivy-covered mill, on the right, there was a recess of meadows, cut by deep shade; opposite, as far as the Seine, flowing at the foot of the hill, parked avenues intersected, where motionless lines of carriages waited; then, towards Boulogne, on the left, the country, widened again, opened a gap on the bluish distances of Meudon, which was blocked by an alley of paulownias,53 whose pink heads, without a leaf, made a sheet of bright lacquer. People were still arriving, a trail of anthills came from over there, by the thin ribbon of a path, across the land; while, very far away, towards Paris, the public who did not pay, a herd camping in the forests, placed a moving line of dark spots, level with the Bois, under the trees.","A tremor passed slowly through the crowd, whilst a fresh peal of the bell announced the arrival of the horses at the starting-place. Then Nana, to obtain a better view, stood up on one of the seats of her landau, treading on the bouquets of forget-me-nots and roses. With a glance round, she took in the vast horizon. At this last moment, when the excitement was at fever heat, she beheld first of all the empty course, enclosed by its grey barriers, along which policemen were stationed at intervals, and the broad band of muddy grass before her became greener and greener in the distance, until it merged into a soft velvety carpet. Then, as she lowered her eyes and gazed around in her immediate vicinity, she saw an ever-moving crowd standing on tip-toe or clambering on to the vehicles, excited and animated by the same passion, with the horses neighing, the refreshment tents shaking in the wind, and riders urging on their steeds in the midst of the foot passengers hastening to the barriers; whilst, when she looked at the stands on the other side of the course, the people seemed smaller, the mass of heads appeared merely a medley of colours filling the paths, the benches, and the terraces, beneath the dull sky. And she could see the plain beyond. Behind the ivy-covered windmill, to the right, there was a background of meadows, intersected with plantations; in front, as far as the Seine, which flowed at the foot of the hill, park-like avenues, along which interminable rows of immovable vehicles were waiting, crossed each other; then on the left, towards Boulogne, the country spreading out again, opened into a view of the bluey heights of Meudon, intercepted only by a row of pawlonias, the rosy tufts of which, without a single leaf, formed a sheet of vivid crimson. People still continued to arrive, numbers were hastening from over there looking like so many ants as they wended their way along a narrow path which crossed the fields; whilst far off, in the direction of Paris, the spectators who did not pay, a host who camped out in the wood, formed a long black moving line under the trees on the outskirts of the Bois.","A long shiver ran through the crowd, while a fresh peal from the bell announced the arrival of the horses upon the racecourse. At this Nana got up and stood on one of the seats of her carriage so as to obtain a better view, and in so doing she trampled the bouquets of roses and myosotis underfoot. With a sweeping glance she took in the wide, vast horizon. At this last feverish moment the course was empty and closed by gray barriers, between the posts of which stood a line of policemen. The strip of grass which lay muddy in front of her grew brighter as it stretched away and turned into a tender green carpet in the distance. In the middle landscape, as she lowered her eyes, she saw the field swarming with vast numbers of people, some on tiptoe, others perched on carriages, and all heaving and jostling in sudden passionate excitement. Horses were neighing; tent canvases flapped, while equestrians urged their hacks forward amid a crowd of pedestrians rushing to get places along the barriers. When Nana turned in the direction of the stands on the other side the faces seemed diminished, and the dense masses of heads were only a confused and motley array, filling gangways, steps and terraces and looming in deep, dark, serried lines against the sky. And beyond these again she over looked the plain surrounding the course. Behind the ivy-clad mill to the right, meadows, dotted over with great patches of umbrageous wood, stretched away into the distance, while opposite to her, as far as the Seine flowing at the foot of a hill, the avenues of the park intersected one another, filled at that moment with long, motionless files of waiting carriages; and in the direction of Boulogne, on the left, the landscape widened anew and opened out toward the blue distances of Meudon through an avenue of paulownias, whose rosy, leafless tops were one stain of brilliant lake color. People were still arriving, and a long procession of human ants kept coming along the narrow ribbon of road which crossed the distance, while very far away, on the Paris side, the nonpaying public, herding like sheep among the wood, loomed in a moving line of little dark spots under the trees on the skirts of the Bois.","The bell announcing the arrival of the horses on the track started to ring and a thrill ran through the crowd. To get a better view, Nana climbed up on to the seat of her landau, trampling all over the bunches of flowers, the forget-me-nots and the roses, and she could now see round the whole of the wide horizon. First of all there was the empty track with its grey barriers and police lined up at every second post, the turf around her all muddy but stretching out and becoming greener and greener, until in the distance it turned into a velvety green carpet. Then, looking down, in these last, feverish minutes before the start she could see the public enclosure swarming with people on tiptoe, hanging on to their carriages, frantic with excitement; horses were neighing, the canvas tents were flapping, riders were spurring their horses amongst the spectators on foot who were rushing to lean on the barriers. She turned towards the grandstands; on that side the figures were smaller; the solid mass of faces was a gaudy medley of colours filling the avenues, the tiers of seats, and the packed terraces where they were silhouetted against the sky. And beyond, round the racecourse, she looked out over the plain where, behind the ivy-clad mill on her right, there were meadows sloping away, slashed by giant shadows; opposite, right up to the Seine which flowed along the bottom of the dip, there was the network of avenues of the Bois, with rows of carriages waiting at a standstill. Then on her left, towards Boulogne, the countryside opened up again to give a vista of Meudon in a distant blue haze, blocked off by an avenue of leafless paulownias whose tops formed a bright crimson screen. People were still arriving, winding their way through fields on a narrow path like a long trail of ants, while in the far distance, in the direction of Paris, the non-paying public, a herd of people camping in the wood, formed a line of black dots moving along under the trees, down at the level of the Bois."

"Puis, comme Fauchery l’interrogeait, il consentit à donner des détails, avec une crudité d’expressions qui gênait Hector de la Faloise. Il avait connu Nana et il voulait la lancer. Justement, il cherchait alors une Vénus. Lui, ne s’embarrassait pas longtemps d’une femme ; il aimait mieux en faire tout de suite profiter le public. Mais il avait un mal de chien dans sa baraque, que la venue de cette grande fille révolutionnait. Rose Mignon, son étoile, une fine comédienne et une adorable chanteuse celle-là, menaçait chaque jour de le laisser en plan, furieuse, devinant une rivale. Et, pour l’affiche, quel bousin14, grand Dieu ! Enfin, il s’était décidé à mettre les noms des deux actrices en lettres d’égale grosseur. Il ne fallait pas qu’on l’ennuyât. Lorsqu’une de ses petites femmes, comme il les nommait, Simonne ou Clarisse, ne marchait pas droit, il lui allongeait un coup de pied dans le derrière. Autrement, pas moyen de vivre. Il en vendait, il savait ce qu’elles valaient, les garces !","Then, as Fauchery questioned him, he consented to give details, with a crudeness of expression which embarrassed Hector de la Faloise. He had known Nana and he wanted to launch her. Precisely, he was then looking for a Venus. He did not bother himself for long with a wife; he preferred to make the public profit from it immediately. But he had terrible pain in his barracks, which was revolutionized by the arrival of this big girl. Rose Mignon, his star, a fine actress and an adorable singer that one, threatened every day to leave him in the lurch, furious, guessing a rival. And, for the poster, what a bousin14, great God! Finally, he had decided to put the names of the two actresses in letters of equal size. He shouldn't be bored. When one of his little women, as he called them, Simonne or Clarisse, did not walk straight, he kicked her in the behind. Otherwise, no way to survive. He sold them, he knew what they were worth, the bitches!","Then, in answer to Fauchery ’s questions, he condescended to give certain details, making use of such offensive language that he quite shocked Hector. He had become acquainted with Nana, and wished to bring her out; and it so happened that he was in want of a Venus. He never allowed a woman to hang on to him very long; he preferred to let the public have its share of her at once. But he had had a damnable time in his shop; the arrival of this great hulking girl had revolutionized everything. Rose Mignon, his star, a fine actress and an adorable singer, threatened daily to leave him in the lurch. Divining a rival in Nana she was furious. And the playbills—Deuce take it! what a row they had caused. However, he had decided to print the names of the two actresses in letters of equal size. They had better not badger him too much. When one of his little women, as he called them, Clarisse or Simone, did not do as she was told, he just kicked her behind. If he treated them differently they would never leave him any peace. He dealt in them, and he knew what they were worth, the hussies!","Then as Fauchery began questioning him he consented to enter into a detailed explanation, couched in phraseology so crude that Hector de la Faloise felt slightly disgusted. He had been thick with Nana, and he was anxious to start her on the stage. Well, just about that time he was in search of a Venus. He--he never let a woman encumber him for any length of time; he preferred to let the public enjoy the benefit of her forthwith. But there was a deuce of a row going on in his shop, which had been turned topsy-turvy by that big damsel's advent. Rose Mignon, his star, a comic actress of much subtlety and an adorable singer, was daily threatening to leave him in the lurch, for she was furious and guessed the presence of a rival. And as for the bill, good God! What a noise there had been about it all! It had ended by his deciding to print the names of the two actresses in the same-sized type. But it wouldn't do to bother him. Whenever any of his little women, as he called them--Simonne or Clarisse, for instance--wouldn't go the way he wanted her to he just up with his foot and caught her one in the rear. Otherwise life was impossible. Oh yes, he sold 'em ; HE knew what they fetched, the wenches!","Then, in answer to Fauchery ’s questions, he agreed to give some details, with a coarseness of language which embarrassed la Faloise. He’d had it off with Nana and now he was anxious to launch her on a career. At that particular moment he happened to be looking for a Venus. He never lumbered himself with any woman for long, he preferred to pass on the benefit to the public straight away. But he’d had a hell of a job in his outfit, where the arrival of this fleshy young piece had been causing quite an upset. Scenting a rival, his star turn Rose Mignon, herself a very gifted actress with a charming singing voice, had been threatening every day to leave him in the lurch. And what a fuss over the poster, heavens above! In the end it’d been decided to print the actresses’ names in the same size letters. He didn’t like being buggered about. When one of his ‘little women’, as he called them, didn’t toe the line, he’d give her a kick up the arse. Otherwise life would be unbearable. After all, he knew what the sluts were worth, he sold them!"

"Elle voulait tout visiter. Ce bout de parc, avec ses pelouses, ses massifs d’arbres, ne lui semblait pas si drôle. Un glacier avait installé un grand buffet près des grilles.

"C'était le marquis de Chouard, qui se rabattait sur Satin. Celle-ci avait décidément assez de tout ce monde chic. Nana venait bien de la présenter à Bordenave.

However, she’d been bored stiff standing there with lips sealed for fear of blurting out something stupid and now wanted to make up for lost time, particularly as she’d just run across an old flame of hers, the extra who was taking the part of Pluto, a pastrycook who had once spent a whole week making love to her and bashing her up. She was waiting for him and was irritated because the marquis was addressing her as if she was one of those theatrical ladies. So finally, putting on her most respectable look, she launched a stinging retort:"
"Labordette, très pressé, repartait ; mais elle le rappela. Elle voulait un conseil. Lui, qui gardait des relations dans le monde des entraîneurs et des jockeys, avait des renseignements particuliers sur les écuries. Vingt fois déjà ses pronostics s’étaient réalisés. Le roi des tipsters16, comme on le nommait.","Labordette, in a great hurry, set off again; but she called him back. She wanted advice. He, who maintained connections in the world of trainers and jockeys, had specific information about the stables. Twenty times already his predictions had come true. The king of tipsters16, as he was called.","Labordette, who was in a great hurry, was starting off again; but she called him back. She wanted a piece of advice. He who knew a number of trainers and jockeys, had the best information respecting the different stables. Twenty times already his tips had come off. He was nicknamed the king of the sporting prophets.","Labordette went off again in a great hurry, but she recalled him. She wanted some advice. Since he kept in touch with the world of trainers and jockeys he had special information about various stables. His prognostications had come true a score of times already, and people called him the ""King of Tipsters.""","Labordette was anxious to leave but Nana wouldn’t let him go: she needed advice, and with his contacts in the world of trainers and jockeys he was bound to have inside information on the various stables. His tips had already proved right a score of times; he’d been nicknamed the king of tipsters."
"Il était près de quatre heures. Dans la salle à manger, on venait de dresser une table de jeu, où s’étaient assis Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon et Labordette. Debout, derrière eux, Lucy et Caroline pariaient ; tandis que Blanche, ensommeillée, mécontente de sa nuit, demandait toutes les cinq minutes à Vandeuvres s’ils n’allaient pas bientôt partir. Dans le salon, on essayait de danser. Daguenet était au piano, « à la commode », comme disait Nana ; elle ne voulait pas de « tapeur 46 », Mimi jouait des valses et des polkas, tant qu’on en demandait. Mais la danse languissait, ces dames causaient entre elles, assoupies au fond des canapés. Tout à coup, il y eut un vacarme. Onze jeunes gens, qui arrivaient en bande, riaient très haut dans l’antichambre, se poussaient à la porte du salon ; ils sortaient du bal du ministère de l’Intérieur, en habit et en cravate blanche, avec des brochettes de croix inconnues. Nana, fâchée de cette entrée tapageuse, appela les garçons restés à la cuisine, en leur ordonnant de jeter ces messieurs dehors ; et elle jurait qu’elle ne les avait jamais vus. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet, tous les hommes s’étaient avancés, pour faire respecter la maîtresse de maison. De gros mots volaient, des bras s’allongeaient. Un instant, on put craindre un échange général de claques. Pourtant, un petit blond, l’air maladif, répétait avec insistance :","It was nearly four o'clock. In the dining-room a card table had just been set up, at which Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon and Labordette had sat. Standing behind them, Lucy and Caroline were betting; while Blanche, sleepy, dissatisfied with her night, asked Vandeuvres every five minutes if they were not going to leave soon. In the living room, we were trying to dance. Daguenet was at the piano, ""at the chest of drawers,"" as Nana said; she didn't want a ""46 tapper"", Mimi played waltzes and polkas, as long as we asked. But the dance was languishing, these ladies were chatting among themselves, dozing at the bottom of the sofas. Suddenly there was a commotion. Eleven young men, who arrived in groups, laughed loudly in the antechamber, pushed themselves to the drawing-room door; they were coming out of the ball at the Ministry of the Interior, in suits and white ties, with skewers of unknown crosses. Nana, annoyed at this rowdy entry, called the boys who remained in the kitchen, ordering them to throw these gentlemen out; and she swore she had never seen them. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet, all the men had come forward to make the mistress of the house respect her. Swear words flew, arms stretched out. For a moment, we feared a general exchange of slaps. However, a little blond, with a sickly air, repeated insistently:","It was nearly four o‘clock. In the dining-room a card-table had been placed, around which Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon, and Labordette hastened to seat themselves. Lucy and Caroline stood behind them betting; whilst Blanche, feeling very drowsy and dissatisfied with her evening, kept asking Vandeuvres every five minutes if they would not soon be going. In the drawing-room others were trying to dance. Daguenet was kindly assisting at the piano, as Nana said she wouldn’t have any strumming, and Mimi could play as many waltzes and polkas as any one could wish. But the dancing flagged; many of the women were reclining on the sofas, chatting among themselves. All on a sudden there was a frightful uproar. Eleven young men, who had just arrived together, were laughing very loudly in the anteroom, and pushing their way towards the drawing-room door. They had just left the ball at the Ministry of the Interior, and were all in evening dress and bedecked with various unknown decorations. Nana, annoyed at the noise they made, called the waiters, who were still in the kitchen, and ordered them to chuck the gentlemen out, swearing that she had never seen them before. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet, and the other men hastened forward to insure the respect due to the lady of the house. Angry words were uttered, fists were shaken. Another minute, and there would have been a general punching of heads. However, a little fair-haired fellow, with a most sickly appearance, kept on repeating, “Come now, Nana; the other night, at Peters’s, in the big red room.","It was close on four o'clock. In the dining room a card table had just been set out, at which Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon and Labordette had taken their seats. Behind them Lucy and Caroline stood making bets, while Blanche, nodding with sleep and dissatisfied about her night, kept asking Vandeuvres at intervals of five minutes if they weren't going soon. In the drawing room there was an attempt at dancing. Daguenet was at the piano or ""chest of drawers,"" as Nana called it. She did not want a ""thumper,"" for Mimi would play as many waltzes and polkas as the company desired. But the dance was languishing, and the ladies were chatting drowsily together in the corners of sofas. Suddenly, however, there was an outburst of noise. A band of eleven young men had arrived and were laughing loudly in the anteroom and crowding to the drawing room. They had just come from the ball at the Ministry of the Interior and were in evening dress and wore various unknown orders. Nana was annoyed at this riotous entry, called to the waiters who still remained in the kitchen and ordered them to throw these individuals out of doors. She vowed that she had never seen any of them before. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet and the rest of the men had all come forward in order to enforce respectful behavior toward their hostess. Big words flew about; arms were outstretched, and for some seconds a general exchange of fisticuffs was imminent. Notwithstanding this, however, a little sickly looking light-haired man kept insistently repeating:","It was nearly four o’clock. In the dining-room a card-table had been set up and Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon, and Labordette were sitting there while Lucy and Caroline stood behind them making bets; but Blanche, not having enjoyed her night, was drowsily asking Vandeuvres every five minutes if they couldn’t go home soon. In the drawing-room they were trying to dance. Daguenet was at the piano, the ‘chest-of-drawers’ as Nana called it; she didn’t want an ‘ivory tickler’, Mimi could play waltzes and polkas till the cows came home. But the dancing was hardly going with a swing; their ladyships were chatting amongst themselves, slumped half-asleep on settees. There was a sudden uproar. Eleven young men had arrived in a gang and were larking about in the entrance hall, trying to force their way towards the door of the drawing-room. They had come from the Interior Minister’s ball and were wearing white ties, tails, and an assortment of unknown decorations. Annoyed by this boisterous intrusion, Nana called to the waiters in the kitchen to turn the gentlemen out; she swore she’d never set eyes on them before. Fauchery, Daguenet, Labordette, and the other men went over to make them show proper respect to the lady of the house. Abuse was flying around, threatening gestures were made, and for a moment a wholesale brawl seemed imminent. However, a blond young man, rather sickly-looking, kept saying:"

Familiar, in the sense of “suddenly attacking”. In L'Assommoir, Gervaise, without news of her daughter, Nana, knows ""that we had seen her pinching a ruckus at the Grand Salon de la Folie"".","She occupied, in the Boulevard Haussmann, the second storey of a large new house, the owner of which was content to let to single ladies, in order to get his plaster dried.","The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop--to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze.","The flat was far too big for her and had never been completely furnished; the flashy, opulent, gilt chairs and console tables formed a violent contrast to the second-hand junk, mahogany pedestal tables and zinc candelabra pretending to be Florentine bronze."
"Alors il leva les yeux. Nana s’était absorbée dans son ravissement d’elle-même. Elle pliait le cou, regardant avec attention dans la glace un petit signe brun qu’elle avait au-dessus de la hanche droite ; et elle le touchait du bout du doigt, elle le faisait saillir en se renversant davantage, le trouvant sans doute drôle et joli, à cette place. Puis, elle étudia d’autres parties de son corps, amusée, reprise de ses curiosités vicieuses d’enfant. Ça la surprenait toujours de se voir ; elle avait l’air étonné et séduit d’une jeune fille qui découvre sa puberté. Lentement, elle ouvrit les bras pour développer son torse de Vénus grasse, elle ploya la taille, s’examinant de dos et de face, s’arrêtant au profil de sa gorge, aux rondeurs fuyantes de ses cuisses. Et elle finit par se plaire au singulier jeu de se balancer, à droite, à gauche, les genoux écartés, la taille roulant sur les reins, avec le frémissement continu d’une almée 18 dansant la danse du ventre.","So he looked up. Nana was absorbed in her delight with herself. She bent her neck, gazing intently in the mirror at a small brown sign she had above her right hip; and she touched it with the tip of her finger, she made it stand out by leaning back more, doubtless finding it funny and pretty, in this place. Then she studied other parts of her body, amused, resumed with her vicious childish curiosities. It always surprised her to see herself; she had the astonished and seduced look of a young girl discovering her puberty. Slowly, she opened her arms to develop her fat Venus torso, she bent at the waist, examining herself from behind and from the front, stopping at the profile of her throat, at the fleeting curves of her thighs. And she ends up enjoying the singular game of swinging, to the right, to the left, the knees apart, the waist rolling on the loins, with the continuous quivering of an alme 18 dancing the belly dance.","Then he raised his eyes. Nana was absorbed in her admiration of herself. She had bent her neck and was looking attentively in the glass at a little brown mole on her side, and she touched it with the tip of her finger, making it stand out more by slightly leaning back, thinking, no doubt, that it looked droll and pretty. Then she amused herself by studying other parts of her body with the vicious curiosity of her childhood. It always surprised her thus to see herself; she appeared amazed and fascinated like a young girl on first discovering her puberty. After slowly spreading out her arms to develop her plump Venus-like frame, she ended by swinging herself from right to left, her knees wide apart, her body bent back over her loins, with the continual quivering movement of an almeh dancing the stomach dance.","He looked up. Nana had grown absorbed in her ecstatic self- contemplation. She was bending her neck and was looking attentively in the mirror at a little brown mark above her right haunch. She was touching it with the tip of her finger and by dint of bending backward was making it stand out more clearly than ever. Situated where it was, it doubtless struck her as both quaint and pretty. After that she studied other parts of her body with an amused expression and much of the vicious curiosity of a child. The sight of herself always astonished her, and she would look as surprised and ecstatic as a young girl who has discovered her puberty. Slowly, slowly, she spread out her arms in order to give full value to her figure, which suggested the torso of a plump Venus. She bent herself this way and that and examined herself before and behind, stooping to look at the side view of her bosom and at the sweeping contours of her thighs. And she ended with a strange amusement which consisted of swinging to right and left, her knees apart and her body swaying from the waist with the perpetual jogging, twitching movements peculiar to an oriental dancer in the danse du ventre.","He looked up. Nana was lost in blissful contemplation of herself. Craning her neck, she was examining in the mirror a little brown birthmark above her right hip, touching it with the tip of her finger and making it stick up by leaning backwards, no doubt thinking it looked funny as well as pretty in that particular spot. Then, falling back into the vicious habits of her childhood, she amused herself by studying other parts of her body. She was always curious to find something new whenever she looked at herself; she had the intrigued and fascinated expression of a girl who discovers she’s turning into a woman. Slowly she opened her arms to bring out the full, plump beauty of her Venus-like torso, bending at the waist, examining herself back and front, lingering over the curves of her breasts and her round thighs tapering towards the knees. Finally, she decided to indulge in a peculiar exercise: standing with her knees apart, she swayed to and fro rolling her hips in the continuous circular motion of Egyptian belly-dancers."

"Il obtint difficilement son pardon. Au fond, il était ravi. C'était par des scènes pareilles qu’elle le tenait souple et convaincu. Depuis longtemps, elle lui avait imposé Georges, un gamin qui l’amusait, disait-elle. Elle le fit dîner avec Philippe, et le comte se montra très aimable ; au sortir de table, il prit le jeune homme à part, il lui demanda des nouvelles de sa mère. Dès lors, les fils Hugon, Vandeuvres et Muffat furent ouvertement de la maison, où ils se serraient la main en intimes. C'était plus commode. Seul Muffat mettait encore de la discrétion à venir trop souvent, gardant le ton de cérémonie d’un étranger en visite. La nuit, quand Nana, assise à terre, sur ses peaux d’ours, retirait ses bas, il parlait amicalement de ces messieurs, de Philippe surtout, qui était la loyauté même.","It was difficult for him to obtain his forgiveness. Deep down, he was delighted. It was by such scenes that she kept him supple and convinced. For a long time, she had imposed Georges on her, a kid who amused her, she said. She made him dine with Philippe, and the Count was very amiable; on leaving the table, he took the young man aside, he asked him for news of his mother. From then on, the Hugon, Vandeuvres and Muffat sons were openly part of the house, where they shook hands as intimates. It was more convenient. Only Muffat was still discreet about coming too often, keeping the ceremonial tone of a visiting stranger. At night, when Nana, seated on the ground, on her bearskins, took off her stockings, he spoke amicably of these gentlemen, especially of Philippe, who was loyalty itself.","He had great difficulty in obtaining forgiveness. At heart he was delighted. It was by similar scenes to this that she kept him obedient and convinced of her fidelity. For some time past she had made him submit to George’s presence—a youngster who amused her, so she said. She got him to dine with Philippe, and the count was very amiable. On leaving the table, he took the young man on one side, and asked him for news of his mother. From that time the Hugons, Vandeuvres, and Muffat, openly belonged to the establishment, where they met together as intimate friends. It was more convenient. Muffat alone still discreetly timed his visits so as not to call too often, and invariably affected the ceremonious air of a stranger. At night-time, when Nana, seated on the floor on her bear-skins, pulled off her stockings, he talked in a friendly way of the other gentlemen, of Philippe especially, who was loyalty itself.","He obtained his pardon with difficulty, but at bottom he was enchanted. It was with scenes such as these that she kept him in unquestioning and docile submission. She had long since succeeded in imposing Georges on him as a young vagabond who, she declared, amused her. She made him dine with Philippe, and the count behaved with great amiability. When they rose from table he took the young man on one side and asked news of his mother. From that time forth the young Hugons, Vandeuvres and Muffat were openly about the house and shook hands as guests and intimates might have done. It was a more convenient arrangement than the previous one. Muffat alone still abstained discreetly from too-frequent visits, thus adhering to the ceremonious policy of an ordinary strange caller. At night when Nana was sitting on her bearskins drawing off her stockings, he would talk amicably about the other three gentlemen and lay especial stress on Philippe, who was loyalty itself.","He found it hard to obtain her forgiveness. At heart, he was delighted. She used such scenes to keep him reassured and docile. In the past, she’d forced him to accept Georges; such an amusing youngster, she said. She had the count to dinner with Philippe and Muffat showed himself very friendly; after dinner, he drew the young man to one side and enquired after his mother. From that time onwards, the Hugon brothers, Vandeuvres, and Muffat became a regular, acknowledged part of the household and were on the friendliest of terms. It was a more convenient arrangement. Only Muffat tactfully refrained from coming too often, continuing to stand on ceremony, as if he were just a casual caller. At night, as Nana sat taking off her stockings on her bearskin rugs, he’d talk amiably about ‘those nice young men’, particularly of Philippe; what a genuine, honest young fellow he was!"

"Elle attendit. Cette phrase lui montait aux lèvres : « Fauchery n’a rien à te refuser » ; mais elle sentit que ce serait un peu raide comme argument.

"Ce fut comme la clameur montant d’une marée. Nana ! Nana ! Nana ! Le cri roulait, grandissait, avec une violence de tempête, emplissant peu à peu l’horizon, des profondeurs du Bois au mont Valérien, des prairies de Longchamp à la plaine de Boulogne. Sur la pelouse, un enthousiasme fou s’était déclaré. Vive Nana ! Vive la France ! À bas l’Angleterre ! Les femmes brandissaient leurs ombrelles ; des hommes sautaient, tournaient, en vociférant ; d’autres, avec des rires nerveux, lançaient des chapeaux. Et, de l’autre côté de la piste, l’enceinte du pesage répondait, une agitation remuait les tribunes, sans qu’on vît distinctement autre chose qu’un tremblement de l’air, comme la flamme invisible d’un brasier, au-dessus de ce tas vivant de petites figures détraquées, les bras tordus, avec les points noirs des yeux et de la bouche ouverte. Cela ne cessait plus, s’enflait, recommençait au fond des allées lointaines, parmi le peuple campant sous les arbres, pour s’épandre et s’élargir dans l’émotion de la tribune impériale, où l’impératrice avait applaudi. Nana ! Nana ! Nana ! Le cri montait dans la gloire du soleil, dont la pluie d’or battait le vertige de la foule.","It was like the rising clamor of a tide. Nana! Nana! Nana! The cry rolled, grew louder, with the violence of a storm, gradually filling the horizon, from the depths of the Bois to Mont Valérien, from the meadows of Longchamp to the plain of Boulogne. On the lawn, a mad enthusiasm was declared. Long live Nana! Long live France ! Down with England! The women brandished their parasols; men were jumping, turning, vociferating; others, with nervous laughter, threw hats. And, on the other side of the track, the weighing enclosure responded, an agitation shook the stands, without anything distinctly being seen but a trembling of the air, like the invisible flame of a brazier, above this living heap of clumsy little figures, arms twisted, with blackheaded eyes and open mouths. It never ceased, swelled, began again at the end of the distant alleys, among the people camping under the trees, to spread and widen in the emotion of the Imperial tribune, where the Empress had applauded. Nana! Nana! Nana! The cry rose in the glory of the sun, whose golden rain beat down the vertigo of the crowd.","The clamour that burst forth was like the roar of the rising tide. “Nana! Nana! Nana!” The cry rolled and grew with the violence of a tempest, gradually filling the air, from the innermost recesses of the Bois to Mount Valérien, from the meadows of Longchamps to the plain of Boulogne. Around Nana’s landau a mad enthusiasm was displayed. “Long Live Nana! Long Live France! Down with England!” The women waved their parasols. Some men sprung into the air, and turned round vociferating; others, laughing nervously, flung up their hats. And on the other side of the course the crowd in the enclosure responded. An agitation passed through the stands, without one being able to discern anything distinctly, beyond a commotion of the air (like the invisible flame of a brazier) above that living heap of little chaotic figures, twisting their arms about, with black specks indicating their eyes and open mouths. The cry continued unceasingly, growing in intensity, caught up in the distance by the people camping beneath the trees, to spread again and increase itself with the emotion of the imperial stand, where the Empress joined in the applause. “Nana! Nana! Nana!” The shout rose beneath the glorious sun, which stimulated the delirium of the crowd with a shower of gold.","There was an uproar as of a rising tide. "" Nana! Nana! Nana!"" The cry rolled up and swelled with the violence of a tempest, till little by little it filled the distance, the depths of the Bois as far as Mont Valerien, the meadows of Longchamps and the Plaine de Boulogne. In all parts of the field the wildest enthusiasm declared itself. "" Vive Nana! Vive la France! Down with England!"" The women waved their sunshades; men leaped and spun round, vociferating as they did so, while others with shouts of nervous laughter threw their hats in the air. And from the other side of the course the enclosure made answer; the people on the stands were stirred, though nothing was distinctly visible save a tremulous motion of the air, as though an invisible flame were burning in a brazier above the living mass of gesticulating arms and little wildly moving faces, where the eyes and gaping mouths looked like black dots. The noise did not cease but swelled up and recommenced in the recesses of faraway avenues and among the people encamped under the trees, till it spread on and on and attained its climax in the imperial stand, where the empress herself had applauded. "" Nana! Nana! Nana!"" The cry rose heavenward in the glorious sunlight, whose golden rain beat fiercely on the dizzy heads of the multitude.","All hell broke loose: Nana! Nana! Nana! The cry rang out, echoing and re-echoing in ever-increasing waves, like a hurricane, gradually sweeping out towards the distant horizon, from the depths of the Bois to Mont Valérien, from the meadows of Longchamp to the plain of Boulogne. In the enclosure, wild enthusiasm reigned. Long live Nana! Long live France! Down with England! Women were brandishing sunshades, men were screaming and twirling as they danced up and down; others were laughing excitedly and flinging their hats in the air. And the private enclosure on the other side of the track was responding similarly, the grandstands were in a turmoil, though the only thing that could be clearly seen was a sort of quivering in the air, like the invisible flame of a brazier above this living pile of tiny, hysterical figures with writhing arms and open mouths and eyes like black pin-points. The roaring went on and on, swelling until it was taken up at the far end of the distant avenues and among the public camping under the trees, expanding and spreading even up to the excited spectators sitting in the Imperial grandstand, where the Empress herself had been seen applauding. Nana! Nana! Nana! The cry rose up as the glorious sunlight flooded the delirious crowd in a golden glow."

"Et elle avait un frisson, tandis que le comte, surpris de ces questions singulières en un pareil moment, sentait s’éveiller ses remords de catholique.

"Déjà le comte Muffat se dirigeait vers le couloir des loges. La pente assez rapide de la scène l’avait surpris, et son inquiétude venait beaucoup de ce plancher qu’il sentait mobile sous ses pieds ; par les costières ouvertes, on apercevait les gaz brûlant dans les dessous ; c’était une vie souterraine, avec des profondeurs d’obscurité, des voix d’hommes, des souffles de cave. Mais, comme il remontait, un incident l’arrêta. Deux petites femmes, en costume pour le troisième acte, causaient devant l’œil du rideau. L'une d’elles, les reins tendus, élargissant le trou avec ses doigts, pour mieux voir, cherchait dans la salle.","Already Count Muffat was heading towards the corridor of the boxes. The fairly steep slope of the stage had taken him by surprise, and his anxiety came a great deal from this floor which he felt shifting under his feet; through the open upstands, you could see the burning gases below; it was an underground life, with depths of darkness, men's voices, cellar breaths. But, as he was going up, an incident stopped him. Two little women, in costume for the third act, were chatting before the eye of the curtain. One of them, her back tense, enlarging the hole with her fingers, to see better, searched the room.","Count Muffat had already moved off in the direction of the passage leading to the dressing-rooms. The rather sharp incline of the stage surprised him, and his uneasiness was to a great extent caused by these boards, which seemed to move beneath his feet. Through the open trap-doors he could see the gas-lights burning beneath. It was quite an underground world, with deep and obscure abysses, from which arose the sound of men’s voices, and the musty smell peculiar to cellars. But, as he passed along, a slight incident detained him. Two little women, dressed for the third act, were conversing together before the peep-hole of the curtain. One of them, leaning forward and widening the opening with her fingers, so as to see better, was looking round the house.","Count Muffat was already making for the dressing-room passage. The really sharp downward slope of the stage had surprised him disagreeably, and he owed no small part of his present anxiety to a feeling that its boards were moving under his feet. Through the open sockets gas was descried burning in the ""dock."" Human voices and blasts of air, as from a vault, came up thence, and, looking down into the depths of gloom, one became aware of a whole subterranean existence. But just as the count was going up the stage a small incident occurred to stop him. Two little women, dressed for the third act, were chatting by the peephole in the curtain. One of them, straining forward and widening the hole with her fingers in order the better to observe things, was scanning the house beyond.","Count Muffat was already making his way towards the passage leading to the dressing-rooms. He had been surprised at the relatively steep slope of the stage and his worried look came in great part from feeling the floor moving under his feet; through the open cuts, gas-jets could be seen burning below stage, an underground world like a cellar, full of deep shadows, draughts, and voices. As he was walking upstage he saw something which brought him to a halt: two young women, dressed for the third act, were talking to each other in front of the peephole in the curtains. One of them was bending forward with her backside stuck out, holding the hole open with her fingers in order to get a better look into the auditorium."

"À ce moment, la pelouse s’animait davantage. Des lunchs s’organisaient en plein air, en attendant le Grand Prix. On mangeait, on buvait plus encore, un peu partout, sur l’herbe, sur les banquettes élevées des four-in-hand et des mail-coaches, dans les victorias, les coupés, les landaus30. C'était un étalage de viandes froides, une débandade de paniers de champagne, qui sortaient des caissons31, aux mains des valets de pied. Les bouchons partaient avec de faibles détonations, emportées par le vent ; des plaisanteries se répondaient, des bruits de verres qui se brisaient mettaient des notes fêlées dans cette gaieté nerveuse. Gaga et Clarisse faisaient avec Blanche un repas sérieux, mangeant des sandwiches sur une couverture étalée, dont elles couvraient leurs genoux. Louise Violaine, descendue de son panier32, avait rejoint Caroline Héquet ; et, à leurs pieds, dans le gazon, des messieurs installaient une buvette, où venaient boire Tatan, Maria, Simonne et les autres ; tandis que, près de là, en l’air, on vidait des bouteilles sur le mail-coach de Léa de Horn, toute une bande se grisant dans le soleil, avec des bravades et des poses, au-dessus de la foule. Mais bientôt on se pressa surtout devant le landau de Nana. Debout, elle s’était mise à verser des verres de champagne aux hommes qui la saluaient. L'un des valets de pied, François, passait les bouteilles, pendant que la Faloise, tâchant d’attraper une voix canaille, lançait un boniment.","At this time, the lawn was more animated. Lunches were organized in the open air, while waiting for the Grand Prix. We ate, we drank even more, almost everywhere, on the grass, on the high benches of four-in-hands and mail-coaches, in victorias, coupés, prams. It was a display of cold meats, a stampede of baskets of champagne coming out of boxes,31 in the hands of the footmen. The corks went off with weak detonations, carried by the wind; jokes answered each other, the sound of glass breaking put cracked notes in this nervous gaiety. Gaga and Clarisse were having a serious meal with Blanche, eating sandwiches on a spread blanket, which they covered their knees with. Louise Violaine, alighting from her basket32, had joined Caroline Héquet; and, at their feet, in the lawn, gentlemen were setting up a refreshment bar, where Tatan, Maria, Simonne and the others came to drink; while, near there, in the air, bottles were being emptied on Léa de Horn's mail-coach, a whole gang getting drunk in the sun, with bravado and poses, above the crowd. But soon people crowded especially in front of Nana's pram. Standing, she had begun to pour glasses of champagne to the men who greeted her. One of the footmen, François, passed the bottles, while La Faloise, trying to catch a rascal's voice, gave a spiel.","At this moment the animation increased around. Luncheons were spread in the open air to help to pass the time until the race for the Grand Prize was run. Everyone ate, and drank still more, anywhere—on the grass, on the high seats of the stage-coaches and the drags, in the victorias, the broughams, and the landaus. There was a general spread of cold meats, an unpacking of hampers of champagne, which the footmen brought from under box seats. The corks flew out with feeble detonations, which were carried away by the wind; jokes were bandied about; the sound of breaking glasses introduced cracked notes into the nervous gaiety. Gaga and Clarisse were making quite a meal with Blanche, devouring sandwiches on a cloth which they had spread over their knees. Louise Violaine had alighted from her basket chaise and joined Caroline Héquet; and on the grass, at their feet, some gentlemen had set up an imitation bar, where Tatan, Maria, Simone, and the others came to drink; whilst close by, up aloft, there was quite a band on a stage-coach with Léa de Horn, all emptying bottles as fast as they could, and getting quite tipsy in the sunshine, shouting and gesticulating above the crowd. But soon everyone pressed round Nana’s landau. She was standing up filling glasses of champagne for the men who came to shake hands with her. One of the footmen, François, handed up the bottle, whilst La Faloise, imitating the voice of a mountebank, called out,","Just then the field grew more animated than before. Open-air lunches were arranged in the interval before the Grand Prix. There was much eating and more drinking in all directions, on the grass, on the high seats of the four-in-hands and mail coaches, in the victorias, the broughams, the landaus. There was a universal spread of cold viands and a fine disorderly display of champagne baskets which footmen kept handing down out of the coach boots. Corks came out with feeble pops, which the wind drowned. There was an interchange of jests, and the sound of breaking glasses imparted a note of discord to the high-strung gaiety of the scene. Gaga and Clarisse, together with Blanche, were making a serious repast, for they were eating sandwiches on the carriage rug with which they had been covering their knees. Louise Violaine had got down from her basket carriage and had joined Caroline Hequet. On the turf at their feet some gentlemen had instituted a drinking bar, whither Tatan, Maria, Simonne and the rest came to refresh themselves, while high in air and close at hand bottles were being emptied on Lea de Horn's mail coach, and, with infinite bravado and gesticulation, a whole band were making themselves tipsy in the sunshine, above the heads of the crowd. Soon, however, there was an especially large crowd by Nana's landau. She had risen to her feet and had set herself to pour out glasses of champagne for the men who came to pay her their respects. Francois, one of the footmen, was passing up the bottles while La Faloise, trying hard to imitate a coster's accents, kept pattering away:","The enclosure was now becoming livelier and livelier. While they waited for the Grand Prix, people were organizing picnic lunches; all around there was a lot being eaten and even more drunk, on the grass, on the raised seats of the four-in-hands and mail-coaches, in the victorias, the coupés, and the landaus. Footmen were unloading the boots to display vast assortments of cold meats and an impressive array of cases of champagne. The sound of popping corks was swept away on the wind; people were exchanging jokes; the cheerful hum of excited voices was punctuated by the jarring tinkle of broken glass. Gaga and Clarisse were tucking in beside Blanche, munching sandwiches on a rug spread out on their laps. Louise Violaine had got out of her dogcart and joined Caroline Héquet, while on the grass at their feet gentlemen friends had rigged up a little bar where Tatan, Maria, Simonne, and the others were going up to be served; nearby, on Léa de Horn’s mail-coach, drink was being consumed by a whole group of people sitting in the sun and getting tipsy, blustering and posing perched high up above the crowd. But soon Nana’s landau became the centre of attraction. She had got to her feet and was pouring glasses of champagne for the men who were pressing forward to greet her. François, one of her footmen, was passing up the bottles while la Faloise tried to put on a vulgar accent in a stream of sales-patter:"

"Ce fut l’époque de son existence où Nana éclaira Paris d’un redoublement de splendeur. Elle grandit encore à l’horizon du vice, elle domina la ville de l’insolence affichée de son luxe, de son mépris de l’argent, qui lui faisait fondre publiquement les fortunes. Dans son hôtel, il y avait comme un éclat de forge. Ses continuels désirs y flambaient, un petit souffle de ses lèvres changeait l’or en une cendre fine que le vent balayait à chaque heure. Jamais on n’avait vu une pareille rage de dépense. L'hôtel semblait bâti sur un gouffre, les hommes avec leurs biens, leurs corps, jusqu’à leurs noms, s’y engloutissaient, sans laisser la trace d’un peu de poussière. Cette fille, aux goûts de perruche, croquant des radis et des pralines, chipotant la viande, avait chaque mois pour sa table des comptes de cinq mille francs3. C'était, à l’office, un gaspillage effréné, un coulage féroce, qui éventrait les barriques de vin, qui roulait des notes enflées par trois ou quatre mains successives. Victorine et François régnaient en maîtres dans la cuisine, où ils invitaient du monde, en dehors d’un petit peuple de cousins nourris à domicile de viandes froides et de bouillon gras ; Julien exigeait des remises chez les fournisseurs, les vitriers ne remettaient pas un carreau de trente sous, sans qu’il s’en fît ajouter vingt pour lui ; Charles mangeait l’avoine des chevaux, doublant les fournitures, revendant par une porte de derrière ce qui entrait par la grande porte ; tandis que, au milieu de ce gaspillage général, dans ce sac 4 de ville emportée d’assaut, Zoé, à force d’art, parvenait à sauver les apparences, couvrait les vols de tous pour mieux y confondre et sauver les siens. Mais ce qu’on perdait était pis encore, la nourriture de la veille jetée à la borne5, un encombrement de provisions dont les domestiques se dégoûtaient, le sucre 6 empoissant les verres, le gaz brûlant à pleins becs, jusqu’à faire sauter les murs ; et des négligences, et des méchancetés, et des accidents, tout ce qui peut hâter la ruine, dans une maison dévorée par tant de bouches. Puis, en haut, chez madame, la débâcle soufflait plus fort ; des robes de dix mille francs, mises deux fois, vendues 7 par Zoé ; des bijoux qui disparaissaient, comme émiettés au fond des tiroirs ; des achats bêtes, les nouveautés du jour, oubliées le lendemain dans les coins, balayées à la rue. Elle ne pouvait voir quelque chose de très cher sans en avoir envie, elle faisait ainsi autour d’elle un continuel désastre de fleurs, de bibelots précieux, d’autant plus heureuse que son caprice d’une heure coûtait davantage. Rien ne lui restait aux mains ; elle cassait tout, ça se fanait, ça se salissait entre ses petits doigts blancs ; une jonchée de débris sans nom, de lambeaux tordus, de loques boueuses, la suivait et marquait son passage. Ensuite éclataient les gros règlements, au milieu de ce gâchis de l’argent de poche : vingt mille francs chez la modiste, trente mille chez la lingère, douze mille chez le bottier ; son écurie lui en mangeait cinquante mille ; en six mois, elle eut chez son couturier une note de cent vingt mille francs. Sans qu’elle eût augmenté son train, estimé par Labordette à quatre cent mille francs en moyenne, elle atteignit cette année-là le million, stupéfaite elle-même de ce chiffre, incapable de dire où avait pu passer une pareille somme. Les hommes entassés les uns par-dessus les autres, l’or vidé à pleine brouette, ne parvenaient pas à combler le trou qui toujours se creusait sous le pavé de son hôtel, dans les craquements de son luxe.","It was the period of her existence when Nana lit up Paris with an increase in splendor. She still grew up on the horizon of vice, she dominated the city with the insolence displayed by her luxury, her contempt for money, which made her fortunes melt away publicly. In his hotel, there was like a splinter of forge. Her continual desires blazed there, a little breath from her lips changed the gold into a fine ash that the wind swept away every hour. Never had such a rage for expenditure been seen. The hotel seemed to be built on an abyss, the men with their belongings, their bodies, even their names, were swallowed up in it, without leaving a trace of a little dust. This girl, with the taste of a parakeet, crunching radishes and pralines, fiddling with meat, had monthly accounts for her table of five thousand francs. It was, at the pantry, a frantic waste, a ferocious pouring, which ripped open the barrels of wine, which rolled notes swollen by three or four successive hands. Victorine and François reigned supreme in the kitchen, where they invited people, apart from a small group of cousins fed at home with cold meats and fatty broth; Julien demanded discounts from the suppliers, the glaziers did not give a thirty-sou pane without him having twenty added for him; Charles ate the horses' oats, doubling the supplies, reselling through a back door what came in through the front door; while, in the midst of this general waste, in this sack of the city taken by assault, Zoe, by dint of art, managed to save appearances, covered up the thefts of all the better to confuse and save her own. But what was lost was even worse, the food of the night before thrown at the bollard5, a clutter of provisions which the servants were disgusted with, the sugar6 stuffing the glasses, the gas burning at full beaks, to the point of blowing up the walls; and negligence, and wickedness, and accidents, all that can hasten ruin, in a house devoured by so many mouths. Then, upstairs, at Madame's, the debacle blew harder; dresses costing ten thousand francs, worn twice, sold for seven by Zoe; jewels which disappeared, as if crumbled at the bottom of the drawers; stupid purchases, the novelties of the day, forgotten the next day in the corners, swept away in the street. She could not see something very dear without wanting to, and thus created around her a continual disaster of flowers, of precious knick-knacks, all the happier because her one-hour whim cost more. Nothing remained in his hands; she broke everything, it faded, it got dirty between her little white fingers; a strewn of nameless debris, twisted shreds, muddy rags, followed her and marked her passage. Then came the big payments, in the midst of this mess of pocket money: twenty thousand francs at the milliner's, thirty thousand at the seamstress's, twelve thousand at the shoemaker's; his stable devoured him fifty thousand; in six months, she had a note from her dressmaker for one hundred and twenty thousand francs. Without her having increased her rate, estimated by Labordette at an average of four hundred thousand francs, she reached that year a million, amazed herself at this figure, unable to say where such a sum could have gone. The men piled up one on top of the other, the gold emptied by the wheelbarrow, could not manage to fill the hole which was always dug under the pavement of his hotel, in the creaks of his luxury.","This was the epoch of her existence when Nana brightened Paris with an increase of splendour. She became more imposing still on the horizon of vice; she domineered over the city with the insolent display of her luxury, with her contempt for money, which caused her to publicly melt away fortunes. In her mansion there was like the glare of a furnace. Her continual desires fed it. The least breath from her lips would change the gold into fine ashes, which the wind swept away at every hour. Never before had such a mania for expense been seen. The house seemed built over an abyss, into which men with their wealth, their bodies, even their names, were precipitated, without leaving the trace of a little dust behind. This girl with the tastes of a parrot, nibbling radishes and burnt almonds, playing with her meat, had bills to the extent of five thousand francs a month for her table. In the servants’ hall there was unbridled waste, a ferocious leakage, which emptied the casks of wine, and ran up bills increased by three or four hands through which they passed. Victorine and François reigned supreme in the kitchen, where they invited their friends, not to speak of a host of cousins whom they fed at their own homes with cold joints and meat soups. Julien exacted commissions from all the tradespeople. A glazier did not put in a thirty sou pane of glass but the butler had twenty added on for himself. Charles devoured the oats for the horses, ordering double the necessary supply, selling by a back door what came in by the front one; whilst in the midst of this universal pillage, of this sack of a town taken by assault, Zoé, by great art, succeeded in saving appearances, covering the thefts of all the others the better to hide and secure her own. But what was wasted was still worse—the food of the previous day thrown in the gutter, an incumbrance of victuals at which the servants turned up their noses, the glasses all sticky with sugar, gas-jets blazing away, turned on recklessly, sufficient to blow up the place; and negligences, and spitefulness, and accidents, all that can hasten ruin in an establishment devoured by so many mouths. Then, upstairs in madame’s rooms, the downfall was even greater still. Dresses costing ten thousand francs, worn only twice, and sold by Zoé; jewels which disappeared as though they had crumbled away at the bottoms of the drawers; idiotic purchases, novelties of the day, forgotten in a corner on the morrow, and swept into the street. She could never see anything costing a great deal without desiring it; she thus created around her a continual devastation of flowers and precious knick-knacks, being all the more delighted in proportion to the price paid for them. Nothing remained perfect in her hands; she broke everything, or it faded or became soiled between her little white fingers; a strewing of nameless remnants, of crumpled rags, of muddy tatters, followed in her wake. Then the heavy settlements burst out in the midst of this waste of pocket-money. Twenty thousand francs owing to the milliner, thirty thousand to the linendraper, twelve thousand to the bootmaker, her stable had swallowed fifty thousand, in six months her dressmaker’s bill had run up to a hundred thousand francs. Without her having added to her household, which Labordette had estimated would cost on an average four hundred thousand francs yearly, she reached that year a million, amazed herself at the sum, and quite incapable of saying where all the money could possibly have gone to. Men piled up one upon the other, gold emptied out in barrowfuls, were unable to fill that chasm which was for ever opening deeper and deeper beneath the foundations of her house, in the disruption of her luxury.","This was the epoch in her existence when Nana flared upon Paris with redoubled splendor. She loomed larger than heretofore on the horizon of vice and swayed the town with her impudently flaunted splendor and that contempt of money which made her openly squander fortunes. Her house had become a sort of glowing smithy, where her continual desires were the flames and the slightest breath from her lips changed gold into fine ashes, which the wind hourly swept away. Never had eye beheld such a rage of expenditure. The great house seemed to have been built over a gulf in which men--their worldly possessions, their fortunes, their very names--were swallowed up without leaving even a handful of dust behind them. This courtesan, who had the tastes of a parrot and gobbled up radishes and burnt almonds and pecked at the meat upon her plate, had monthly table bills amounting to five thousand francs. The wildest waste went on in the kitchen: the place, metaphorically speaking was one great river which stove in cask upon cask of wine and swept great bills with it, swollen by three or four successive manipulators. Victorine and Francois reigned supreme in the kitchen, whither they invited friends. In addition to these there was quite a little tribe of cousins, who were cockered up in their homes with cold meats and strong soup. Julien made the trades-people give him commissions, and the glaziers never put up a pane of glass at a cost of a franc and a half but he had a franc put down to himself. Charles devoured the horses' oats and doubled the amount of their provender, reselling at the back door what came in at the carriage gate, while amid the general pillage, the sack of the town after the storm, Zoe, by dint of cleverness, succeeded in saving appearances and covering the thefts of all in order the better to slur over and make good her own. But the household waste was worse than the household dishonesty. Yesterday's food was thrown into the gutter, and the collection of provisions in the house was such that the servants grew disgusted with it. The glass was all sticky with sugar, and the gas burners flared and flared till the rooms seemed ready to explode. Then, too, there were instances of negligence and mischief and sheer accident--of everything, in fact, which can hasten the ruin of a house devoured by so many mouths. Upstairs in Madame's quarters destruction raged more fiercely still. Dresses, which cost ten thousand francs and had been twice worn, were sold by Zoe; jewels vanished as though they had crumbled deep down in their drawers; stupid purchases were made; every novelty of the day was brought and left to lie forgotten in some corner the morning after or swept up by ragpickers in the street. She could not see any very expensive object without wanting to possess it, and so she constantly surrounded herself with the wrecks of bouquets and costly knickknacks and was the happier the more her passing fancy cost. Nothing remained intact in her hands; she broke everything, and this object withered, and that grew dirty in the clasp of her lithe white fingers. A perfect heap of nameless debris, of twisted shreds and muddy rags, followed her and marked her passage. Then amid this utter squandering of pocket money cropped up a question about the big bills and their settlement. Twenty thousand francs were due to the modiste, thirty thousand to the linen draper, twelve thousand to the bootmaker. Her stable devoured fifty thousand for her, and in six months she ran up a bill of a hundred and twenty thousand francs at her ladies' tailor. Though she had not enlarged her scheme of expenditure, which Labordette reckoned at four hundred thousand francs on an average, she ran up that same year to a million. She was herself stupefied by the amount and was unable to tell whither such a sum could have gone. Heaps upon heaps of men, barrowfuls of gold, failed to stop up the hole, which, amid this ruinous luxury, continually gaped under the floor of her house.","This was the period in her career when Nana’s star blazed with ever-increasing brilliance and her vicious life loomed even larger on the horizon of vice of Paris. Her shameless luxury, her majestic, total disregard for money, so that whole fortunes melted away before everyone’s eyes, had the capital at her feet. Her grand residence was like some glowing furnace where desire was constantly at white heat and her slightest breath could turn gold into fine ash, to be swept away by the wind. Nobody had ever seen such raging extravagance. The house was like a bottomless pit in which men were engulfed with all their possessions; their body and even their name sank without leaving even a tiny speck of dust. This tart with the tastes of an insatiable parakeet, nibbling radishes and sugared almonds and merely pecking at her meat, would spend five thousand francs a month on food for her table. The waste in her kitchen was indescribable, a gigantic haemorrhage, with whole barrels of wine being guzzled and her bills swelling to grotesque proportions as they passed through three or four different hands. The kitchen was under the complete control of Victorine and François; here they would entertain their friends, not forgetting a whole tribe of cousins whose families they kept supplied with cold meats and unlimited quantities of beef-stock. Julien insisted on getting his rake-off from the tradesmen, and every pane of glass, replaced at a cost of one franc, carried a 50 per-cent surcharge for himself; Charles devoured oats by the bushel for his horses, buying double the quantity required and selling off at the back-door whatever was delivered at the front. And at the centre of this wholesale looting operation, like the ransacking of a captured town, Zoé was artfully contriving to save appearances, and covering everybody else ’s thefts in order to include and protect her own. But even worse was the waste: yesterday’s left-overs went straight into the rubbish bin, together with piles of food the servants had got tired of; glasses smeared with sugar, gas-jets left burning full on, threatening to blow up the house; spitefulness, neglect, and bungling, everything that could accelerate the ruin of a household plundered by so many greedy mouths. Upstairs, aided and abetted by the mistress, the collapse was going ahead even more merrily: dresses costing ten thousand francs, worn twice before being discarded and sold off by Zoé; jewellery left mouldering in drawers; stupid purchases, the ‘latest thing’, forgotten the following day and tipped out into the street. She was incapable of seeing anything expensive without wanting to acquire it, swamping herself in floods of flowers and trinkets, all bought on impulse; and the more expensive these things were, the happier she was. She couldn’t hang on to anything: in her dainty white fingers everything disintegrated, withered, or got filthy; strewn around in her wake you’d find tatty, muddy rags, every kind of miscellaneous rubbish. And then, after spending money like water, she was hit by the big bills: twenty thousand francs at the milliner’s, thirty thousand for the linen-draper, twelve thousand for the shoemaker; her stables mopped up another fifty thousand; and in six months she ran up a bill for one-hundred-and-twenty thousand francs with her dressmaker. Without making any change in a life-style which Labordette had estimated to cost an average of four hundred thousand francs, in her very first year she got through a million francs. She couldn’t believe it herself: where on earth had all that money gone? Not even the barrow-loads of cash from the men lining up to get her to bed could stem the flood undermining the foundations of her opulent mansion, which was tottering under the strain."

"Muffat la contemplait. Elle lui faisait peur. Le journal était tombé de ses mains. Dans cette minute de vision nette, il se méprisait. C'était cela : en trois mois, elle avait corrompu sa vie, il se sentait déjà gâté jusqu’aux moelles par des ordures qu’il n’aurait pas soupçonnées. Tout allait pourrir en lui, à cette heure. Il eut un instant conscience des accidents 19 du mal, il vit la désorganisation apportée par ce ferment, lui empoisonné, sa famille détruite, un coin de société qui craquait et s’effondrait.

At that hour everything was beginning to fester within him. For an instant he was conscious of the results of sin, he beheld the disorganization wrought by this ferment, himself poisoned, his family destroyed, a corner of society cracking and tumbling into ruins.

"Ces messieurs concluaient contre les nouvelles théories criminalistes56 ; avec cette belle invention de l’irresponsabilité dans certains cas pathologiques, il n’y avait plus de criminels, il n’y avait que des malades. La jeune femme, qui approuvait de la tête, cherchait de quelle façon elle congédierait le comte. Les autres allaient partir ; mais lui s’entêterait sûrement. En effet, lorsque Philippe se leva pour se retirer, Georges le suivit aussitôt ; sa seule inquiétude était de laisser son frère derrière lui. Vandeuvres resta quelques minutes encore ; il tâtait le terrain, il attendait de savoir si, par hasard, une affaire n’obligerait pas Muffat à lui céder la place ; puis, quand il le vit s’installer carrément pour la nuit, il n’insista pas, il prit congé en homme de tact. Mais, comme il se dirigeait vers la porte, il aperçut Satin, avec son regard fixe ; et, comprenant sans doute, amusé, il vint lui serrer la main.","These gentlemen concluded against the new criminalist theories56; with this fine invention of irresponsibility in certain pathological cases, there were no longer any criminals, only the sick. The young woman, who nodded her approval, was trying to figure out how she would dismiss the count. The others were going to leave; but he would surely persist. In fact, when Philippe got up to retire, Georges immediately followed him; his only concern was leaving his brother behind. Vandeuvres remained a few minutes longer; he was testing the ground, he was waiting to find out if, by chance, some business might not oblige Muffat to give way to him; then, when he saw him settling down for the night, he did not insist, he took his leave like a man of tact. But, as he walked towards the door, he caught sight of Satin, with her fixed gaze; and, no doubt understanding, amused, he came to shake her hand.","The gentlemen were drawing their conclusions against the new theories of the writers on criminal law; with that wonderful proposition as to irresponsibility in certain pathological cases, there threatened to be no more criminals, but only invalids. The young woman, who kept nodding her approval, was trying to think of a means of getting rid of the count. The others would soon be going, but he would be sure to remain behind. And so it happened, when Philippe rose to leave, George followed him at once , his only anxiety was not to leave his brother behind him. Vandeuvres remained a few minutes longer; he sounded the ground; he waited to see if by chance some matter did not oblige Muffat to leave him in possession, but when he saw him evidently making himself comfortable for the rest of the evening, he did not persist, but took his leave like a man of tact. But as he moved towards the door he noticed Satin, with her fixed look; and understanding no doubt, and rather amused, he went and shook her hand.","The gentlemen were deciding against the new criminological theories. Granted that lovely invention of irresponsibility in certain pathological cases, and criminals ceased to exist and sick people alone remained. The young woman, expressing approval with an occasional nod, was busy considering how best to dismiss the count. The others would soon be going, but he would assuredly prove obstinate. In fact, when Philippe got up to withdraw, Georges followed him at once--he seemed only anxious not to leave his brother behind. Vandeuvres lingered some minutes longer, feeling his way, as it were, and waiting to find out if, by any chance, some important business would oblige Muffat to cede him his place. Soon, however, when he saw the count deliberately taking up his quarters for the night, he desisted from his purpose and said good-by, as became a man of tact. But on his way to the door, he noticed Satin staring fixedly at Nana, as usual. Doubtless he understood what this meant, for he seemed amused and came and shook hands with her.","The gentlemen were condemning all these new-fangled theories of criminologists: how very clever of them to have dreamed up the idea of diminished responsibility in certain pathological cases! So there weren’t any criminals now, only sick people! The young woman was nodding approvingly while pondering how she might best get rid of the count. The others would in any case be leaving but Muffat would certainly dig his heels in. Indeed, when Philippe got up to go, Georges immediately followed suit; his only concern had been not to leave his brother behind. Vandeuvres stayed on a few minutes longer, feeling his ground and waiting to see if Muffat perhaps had some business which would force him to relinquish his rightful place. Once he saw him plainly set to stay the night, he didn’t insist and tactfully withdrew. As he was making for the door, he caught sight of Satin staring, and no doubt realizing what was happening he was amused and went over to say goodnight to her too."

On the toilet, the bouquets, of roses, lilacs, hyacinths, put like a fall of flowers, of a penetrating and strong perfume; while, in the moist air, in the insipidity exhaled from the bowls, trailed at times a sharper odor, a few sprigs of patchouli 39 sec, finely broken at the bottom of a cup. And, snuggling up, pulling back her badly fastened bathrobe, Nana seemed to have been surprised at her toilet, her skin still damp, smiling, startled in the midst of her lace.","The two men bowed and sat down. An embroidered blind subdued the light admitted into the room, which was the most elegantly furnished one of the set: it was hung with light drapery, and contained a handsome marble dressing-table, a large cheval-glass, with an inlaid frame, a reclining-chair, and several easy-chairs covered in blue satin. On the dressing-table were placed the bouquets of roses, lilac and hyacinths, quite a pyramid of flowers, emitting a strong and penetrating perfume; whilst in the moist atmosphere, with the insipid smell rising from the dirty water, an odour more pronounced could now and again be discerned, emanating from a few sprigs of dry patchouli broken up into small pieces at the bottom of a cup. And cuddling herself up, drawing round her the unfastened dressing-gown she had slipped on, Nana appeared as though she had been surprised at her toilet, her skin scarcely dried, looking smiling though startled in the midst of her laces.","The two men bowed and seated themselves. A blind of embroidered tulle kept the little room in twilight. It was the most elegant chamber in the flat, for it was hung with some light-colored fabric and contained a cheval glass framed in inlaid wood, a lounge chair and some others with arms and blue satin upholsteries. On the toilet table the bouquets--roses, lilacs and hyacinths--appeared like a very ruin of flowers. Their perfume was strong and penetrating, while through the dampish air of the place, which was full of the spoiled exhalations of the washstand, came occasional whiffs of a more pungent scent, the scent of some grains or dry patchouli ground to fine powder at the bottom of a cup. And as she gathered herself together and drew up her dressing jacket, which had been ill fastened, Nana had all the appearance of having been surprised at her toilet: her skin was still damp; she smiled and looked quite startled amid her frills and laces.","The two men greeted her and sat down. This was the most elegant room in the flat; in the half-light filtering through the embroidered tulle blinds they could see the pale hangings, the marquetry cheval-glass, the Récamier sofa, the blue-satin armchairs, and the large marble dressing-table, which was piled up with a profusion of flowers: bouquets of roses, lilac, and hyacinths whose strong, all-pervasive scent competed in the heavy atmosphere with the sickly smell of wash-basins, and now and again with the more pungent perfume of bowls of crushed dry patchouli. Sitting with her dressing-gown drawn tightly round her, Nana seemed to have been caught in the middle of her toilet, with her skin still damp, smiling and startled amidst her lace."
"— Oh ! tout à fait, balbutia-t-il, étranglé encore, les regards troubles.","- Oh ! Exactly, he stammered, still strangled, his eyes troubled.","“Well! I think that’s good enough, isn’t it?” “Oh! quite,” he stammered, with a choking sensation in his throat, and his glance still dim.","""I guess I've hit it, eh?"" ""Oh, thoroughly,"" he stammered with a broken voice and a troubled expression.","Spot-on, isn’t it?’ ‘Oh, yes, absolutely’, he faltered, still choking and tearful."
"Alors, Nana, tout de suite, entama la Faloise. Il postulait depuis longtemps l’honneur d’être ruiné par elle, afin d’être parfaitement chic. Cela lui manquait, il fallait qu’une femme le lançât. En deux mois, Paris le connaîtrait, et il lirait son nom dans les journaux. Six semaines suffirent. Son héritage était en propriétés, des terres, des prairies, des bois, des fermes. Il dut vendre rapidement, coup sur coup. À chaque bouchée, Nana dévorait un arpent45. Les feuillages frissonnant sous le soleil, les grands blés mûrs, les vignes dorées en septembre, les herbes hautes où les vaches enfonçaient jusqu’au ventre, tout y passait, dans un engloutissement d’abîme ; et il y eut même un cours d’eau, une carrière à plâtre, trois moulins qui disparurent. Nana passait, pareille à une invasion, à une de ces nuées de sauterelles dont le vol de flamme rase une province. Elle brûlait la terre où elle posait son petit pied. Ferme à ferme, prairie à prairie, elle croqua l’héritage, de son air gentil, sans même s’en apercevoir, comme elle croquait entre ses repas un sac de pralines posé sur ses genoux. Ça ne tirait pas à conséquence, c’étaient des bonbons. Mais, un soir, il ne resta qu’un petit bois. Elle l’avala d’un air de dédain, car ça ne valait même pas la peine d’ouvrir la bouche. La Faloise avait un rire idiot, en suçant la pomme de sa canne. La dette l’écrasait, il ne possédait plus cent francs de rente, il se voyait forcé de retourner en province vivre chez un oncle maniaque ; mais ça ne faisait rien, il était chic, Le Figaro avait imprimé deux fois son nom ; et, le cou maigre entre les pointes rabattues de son faux col, la taille cassée sous un veston trop court, il se dandinait, avec des exclamations de perruche et des lassitudes affectées de pantin de bois, qui n’a jamais eu une émotion. Nana, qu’il agaçait, finit par le battre.","So, Nana, immediately, began La Faloise. He had long sought the honor of being ruined by her, in order to be perfectly chic. He missed it, needed a woman to start him. In two months Paris would know him, and he would read his name in the newspapers. Six weeks was enough. His inheritance was in properties, lands, meadows, woods, farms. He had to sell quickly, blow after blow. With each bite, Nana devoured an acre. The foliage quivering under the sun, the tall ripe wheat, the golden vines in September, the tall grass where the cows sank to their stomachs, everything passed there, in an engulfment of an abyss; and there was even a stream, a plaster quarry, three mills which disappeared. Nana passed, like an invasion, one of those swarms of locusts whose flight of flame razes a province. She burned the earth where she put her little foot. Farm to farm, meadow to meadow, she munched on the heritage, with her kind air, without even noticing it, as she munched between her meals a bag of pralines placed on her knees. It didn't matter, it was candy. But one evening there was only a little wood left. She swallowed it with a look of disdain, because it wasn't even worth opening her mouth. La Faloise laughed silly, sucking the apple of his cane. Debt crushed him, he no longer had an income of a hundred francs, he saw himself forced to return to the provinces to live with a maniacal uncle; but that didn't matter, he was chic, Le Figaro had printed his name twice; and, his thin neck between the turned-down points of his false collar, his waist broken under a jacket that was too short, he waddled about with the exclamations of a parakeet and the weariness affected by a wooden puppet who has never had an emotion. Nana, whom he annoyed, ends up beating him.","Then Nana at once started on La Faloise. He had for a long time been soliciting the honour of being ruined by her, so as to be a perfect swell. That was what he was in want of; he must have a woman to bring him out. In two months Paris would know him, and he would read his own name in all the newspapers. Six weeks sufficed. His inheritance consisted of landed estates, fields, pastures, woods, and farms. He had to sell them rapidly, one after the other. At every bite Nana devoured an acre. The foliage frizzling beneath the sun, the rich ripe corn, the golden vines in September, the tall grass in which the cows buried themselves up to their shoulders—all went as though engulfed in some abyss; and there were also a stream, a lime quarry, and three windmills which disappeared. Nana passed like an invading army—like one of those clouds of locusts whose flight destroys a whole province similar to a flame of fire. She burnt the earth wherever she placed her tiny foot. Farm after farm, meadow after meadow, she nibbled up the inheritance in her pretty way, without even noticing what she was about, just the same as she would craunch up a bag of burnt almonds, placed on her knees, between her meals. It was a matter of no consequence; they were merely sweeties. But one night there only remained a small wood. She swallowed it with a disdainful air, for it was really not worth the trouble of opening one’s mouth for. La Faloise laughed in an idiotic way as he sucked the knob of his walking-stick. Debts were crushing him down; he no longer possessed a hundred francs of income. He saw himself obliged to go back to the country and live with a maniacal uncle. But that did not matter; he was a swell. The “Figaro” had twice printed his name; and with his skinny neck rising out of his collar slightly turned down in front, his waist encased in a waistcoat a great deal too tight, he swaggered about, uttering exclamations like a parrot, and affecting the languors of a wooden puppet that has never had an emotion. Nana, whom he irritated immensely, ended by beating him.","Then Nana started on La Faloise at once. He had for some time been longing for the honor of being ruined by her in order to put the finishing stroke on his smartness. He needed a woman to launch him properly; it was the one thing still lacking. In two months all Paris would be talking of him, and he would see his name in the papers. Six weeks were enough. His inheritance was in landed estate, houses, fields, woods and farms. He had to sell all, one after the other, as quickly as he could. At every mouthful Nana swallowed an acre. The foliage trembling in the sunshine, the wide fields of ripe grain, the vineyards so golden in September, the tall grass in which the cows stood knee-deep, all passed through her hands as if engulfed by an abyss. Even fishing rights, a stone quarry and three mills disappeared. Nana passed over them like an invading army or one of those swarms of locusts whose flight scours a whole province. The ground was burned up where her little foot had rested. Farm by farm, field by field, she ate up the man's patrimony very prettily and quite inattentively, just as she would have eaten a box of sweet-meats flung into her lap between mealtimes. There was no harm in it all; they were only sweets! But at last one evening there only remained a single little wood. She swallowed it up disdainfully, as it was hardly worth the trouble opening one's mouth for. La Faloise laughed idiotically and sucked the top of his stick. His debts were crushing him; he was not worth a hundred francs a year, and he saw that he would be compelled to go back into the country and live with his maniacal uncle. But that did not matter; he had achieved smartness; the Figaro had printed his name twice. And with his meager neck sticking up between the turndown points of his collar and his figure squeezed into all too short a coat, he would swagger about, uttering his parrotlike exclamations and affecting a solemn listlessness suggestive of an emotionless marionette. He so annoyed Nana that she ended by beating him.",", there’s a good chap . . .’ Nana immediately turned her attention to la Faloise, who’d been clamouring for the honour of being ruined by her for a long while; this would consecrate him as the smartest man about town; it was a blemish in his career, he needed a woman to launch him. Paris would learn all about him, in a couple of months he’d be reading his name in the papers. However, Nana took only six weeks. La Faloise’s inheritance consisted of property, land, pastures, woods, farms. He had to dispose of the lot, one after another. Each acre provided just one mouthful. The leaves quivering in the sunlight, the tall, ripe wheat, the golden September vines, the long meadow-grass in which cows stood munching up to their bellies, everything went, as if swallowed up in an abyss. There was even a river, a cement quarry, and three mills; they all vanished. Nana shot through like a cloud of invading locusts, a devastating fire flattening a whole province. Wherever she set her little foot, there was burnt earth. Farm by farm, meadow after meadow, she gobbled up his inheritance without even noticing, just as she gobbled up a bag of sugared almonds on her lap between meals. It was quite unimportant, just so many lumps of sugar-candy. But one night the only thing left was a tiny area of woodland. She swallowed it scornfully; it was hardly worth opening your mouth for. La Faloise would give an idiotic laugh, sucking the silver knob of his stick. He had crushing debts, his income was less than a hundred francs, he was faced with the prospect of going back to the provinces and living with a crotchety old uncle; but it didn’t matter, he was ‘smart’, his name had twice appeared in the Figaro, and with his scrawny neck sticking out between the points of his turn-down collar, his slouching shoulders covered by a jacket that was too short, he shuffled round screeching like a parrot, putting on a wooden, world-weary air, like a puppet incapable of any real emotion. Nana found him so irritating that in the end she thumped him."

"Bientôt, l’argent devint le gros souci de Nana. Fontan avait fait disparaître les sept mille francs ; sans doute, ils étaient en lieu sûr, et jamais elle n’aurait osé le questionner, car elle montrait des pudeurs avec cet oiseau, comme l’appelait Mme Lerat. Elle tremblait qu’il pût la croire capable de tenir à lui pour ses quatre sous. Il avait bien promis de fournir aux besoins du ménage. Les premiers jours, chaque matin, il donnait trois francs. Mais c’étaient des exigences d’homme qui paie ; avec ses trois francs, il voulait de tout, du beurre, de la viande, des primeurs ; et, si elle risquait des observations, si elle insinuait qu’on ne pouvait pas avoir les Halles pour trois francs, il s’emportait, il la traitait de bonne-à-rien, de gâcheuse, de fichue bête que les marchands volaient, toujours prêt d’ailleurs à la menacer de prendre pension autre part. Puis, au bout d’un mois, certains matins, il avait oublié de mettre les trois francs sur la commode. Elle s’était permis de les demander, timidement, d’une façon détournée. Alors, il y avait eu de telles querelles, il lui rendait la vie si dure sous le premier prétexte venu, qu’elle préférait ne plus compter sur lui. Au contraire, quand il n’avait pas laissé les trois pièces de vingt sous, et qu’il trouvait tout de même à manger, il était gai comme un pinson, galant, baisant Nana, valsant avec les chaises. Et elle, tout heureuse, en arrivait à souhaiter de ne rien trouver sur la commode malgré le mal qu’elle avait à joindre les deux bouts. Un jour même, elle lui rendit ses trois francs, contant une histoire, disant avoir encore l’argent de la veille. Comme il n’en avait pas donné la veille, il demeura un instant hésitant, par crainte d’une leçon. Mais elle le regardait de ses yeux d’amour, elle le baisait dans un don absolu de toute sa personne ; et il empocha les pièces avec le petit tremblement convulsif d’un avare qui rattrape une somme compromise. À partir de ce jour, il ne s’inquiéta plus, ne demandant jamais d’où venait la monnaie, la mine grise quand il y avait des pommes de terre, riant à se décrocher les mâchoires devant les dindes et les gigots, sans préjudice 53 pourtant de quelques claques qu’il allongeait à Nana, même dans son bonheur, pour s’entretenir la main.","Soon, money became Nana's main concern. Fontan had made the seven thousand francs disappear; no doubt they were in a safe place, and she would never have dared to question him, for she showed modesty with this bird, as Madame Lerat called it. She trembled that he should think her capable of holding on to him for her four sous. He had indeed promised to provide for the needs of the household. The first few days, every morning, he gave three francs. But these were demands of a man who pays; with his three francs he wanted everything, butter, meat, vegetables; and, if she risked being observed, if she insinuated that one couldn't have Les Halles for three francs, he got carried away, he called her a good-for-nothing, a spoiler, a bloody beast that the merchants stole, besides, always ready to threaten her with taking a pension elsewhere. Then, after a month, some mornings he had forgotten to put the three francs on the chest of drawers. She had allowed herself to ask them, timidly, in a roundabout way. So there had been such quarrels, he made her life so hard on the first pretext that came along, that she preferred not to count on him anymore. On the contrary, when he had not left the three twenty-sou pieces, and when he could still find something to eat, he was gay as a lark, gallant, kissing Nana, waltzing with the chairs. And she, very happy, came to wish that she would find nothing on the chest of drawers despite the difficulty she had in making ends meet. One day she even gave him back his three francs, telling a story, saying that she still had the money from the day before. As he had not given any the day before, he hesitated for a moment, for fear of a lesson. But she looked at him with her eyes of love, she kissed him with an absolute gift of her whole person; and he pocketed the coins with the little convulsive trembling of a miser making up for a compromised sum. From that day on, he didn't worry anymore, never asking where the change came from, his gray face when there were potatoes, laughing his jaws dropping in front of the turkeys and lambs, without prejudice However, he gave Nana a few slaps, even in his happiness, to keep his hand together.","The want of funds soon became Nana’s great care. The seven thousand francs Fontan had taken had quite disappeared. No doubt he had put them in some safe place, and she did not dare question him; for she was very timid with that sorry bird, as Madame Lerat styled him. She trembled lest he should think her capable of sticking to him for the sake of his money. He had promised to give something towards the housekeeping expenses, and he started by giving three francs every morning; but he expected all sorts of things for his money. He wanted everything for his three francs—butter, meat, early fruit, and vegetables; and if she hazarded an observation—if she insinuated that it was impossible to purchase all in the market for three twenty sous pieces—he fumed, he called her a good-for-nothing, an extravagant hussy, a stupid fool whom the market people robbed, and invariably wound up by threatening to get his meals elsewhere. Then after the expiration of a month, on some mornings he would forget to leave the three francs on the top of the chest of drawers. She ventured to ask him for them timidly, in a round-about way; but this had occasioned such quarrels—he made her life so miserable on the first pretext he could get hold of—that she preferred no longer to count on him. Whenever he had not left the money, and found all the same a good dinner ready for him, he was as gay as a lark, and most amiable, embracing Nana and waltzing about the room with the chairs. And this made her so happy that she reached the point of wishing not to find anything on the drawers, in spite of the difficulty she had in making both ends meet. One morning even she returned him his three francs, telling him a long rigmarole about having some money left from the previous day. As he had given nothing for two days he hesitated for a moment, fearing a lesson. But she looked at him with her eyes overflowing with love, she embraced him with a complete abandonment of her whole person; and he put the money back into his pocket, with the slight convulsive trepidation of a miser recovering an amount that had been in danger. From that day he ceased to trouble himself, never asking where the money came from, looking very black when there were only potatoes, and laughing fit to dislocate his jaws on beholding a turkey or a leg of mutton; without prejudice, however, to sundry cuffs with which he favoured Nana, even in his happiest moments, just to keep his hand in training.","Soon money began to engross Nana's whole attention. Fontan had caused the seven thousand francs to vanish away. Without doubt they were quite safe; indeed, she would never have dared ask him questions about them, for she was wont to be blushingly diffident with that bird, as Mme Lerat called him. She trembled lest he should think her capable of quarreling with him about halfpence. He had certainly promised to subscribe toward their common household expenses, and in the early days he had given out three francs every morning. But he was as exacting as a boarder; he wanted everything for his three francs--butter, meat, early fruit and early vegetables--and if she ventured to make an observation, if she hinted that you could not have everything in the market for three francs, he flew into a temper and treated her as a useless, wasteful woman, a confounded donkey whom the tradespeople were robbing. Moreover, he was always ready to threaten that he would take lodgings somewhere else. At the end of a month on certain mornings he had forgotten to deposit the three francs on the chest of drawers, and she had ventured to ask for them in a timid, roundabout way. Whereupon there had been such bitter disputes and he had seized every pretext to render her life so miserable that she had found it best no longer to count upon him. Whenever, however, he had omitted to leave behind the three one-franc pieces and found a dinner awaiting him all the same, he grew as merry as a sandboy, kissed Nana gallantly and waltzed with the chairs. And she was so charmed by this conduct that she at length got to hope that nothing would be found on the chest of drawers, despite the difficulty she experienced in making both ends meet. One day she even returned him his three francs, telling him a tale to the effect that she still had yesterday's money. As he had given her nothing then, he hesitated for some moments, as though he dreaded a lecture. But she gazed at him with her loving eyes and hugged him in such utter self- surrender that he pocketed the money again with that little convulsive twitch or the fingers peculiar to a miser when he regains possession of that which has been well-nigh lost. From that day forth he never troubled himself about money again or inquired whence it came. But when there were potatoes on the table he looked intoxicated with delight and would laugh and smack his lips before her turkeys and legs of mutton, though of course this did not prevent his dealing Nana sundry sharp smacks, as though to keep his hand in amid all his happiness.","Money soon became Nana’s major concern. Fontan had spirited away the seven thousand francs and no doubt put them in a safe place; she would never dare to raise any questions about the matter because she shrank from speaking freely to that ‘bad lot’, as her aunt described him; she was terrified he might think she was fond of him because he had a little money. He had certainly promised to contribute to the household expenses, and for the first few days he did give her three francs every morning. But he was determined to get a lot for his money: butter, meat, out-of-season vegetables; and if she gently tried to point out that three francs wasn’t enough to buy up the whole market, he’d fly into a temper, call her a good-for-nothing, a stupid, wasteful, bloody fool letting herself be diddled by stall-keepers; and he wasn’t slow to hint that he might take his own custom elsewhere. Then, after a month, on some mornings he forgot to leave the three francs on the chest-of-drawers. She timidly, in a roundabout way, tried to remind him, but this gave rise to such squabbles and he made her life so disagreeable on the slightest pretext that she preferred not to have to rely on him. On the other hand, on the days when he hadn’t left any money and still found something on the table in the evening, he was as pleased as a dog with two tails, flirtatious, kissing her and dancing round the room with a chair. This made her so happy that she reached the point of wanting not to find the three francs on the chest-of-drawers, in spite of her difficulty in making ends meet. One day she even gave him back the money, telling him some story about still having something left over from the day before. As he hadn’t given her any money the day before, he had a moment’s hesitation, afraid she might be trying to teach him a lesson. But she was looking at him so lovingly and kissing him, putting herself so completely at his mercy, that he put the coins back into his pocket with the little convulsive quiver of a miser getting back money which he feared he’d lost. From that time on he stopped worrying, never enquired where the cash was coming from, looked sour when there were only potatoes to eat, and laughed delightedly when he saw turkey or a leg of lamb; which didn’t prevent him from administering the odd slap, even when he was pleased, just to keep his hand in."

"On frappait les trois coups, des ouvreuses s’entêtaient à rendre les vêtements, chargées de pelisses et de paletots, au milieu du monde qui rentrait. La claque applaudit le décor, une grotte du mont Etna98, creusée dans une mine d’argent et dont les flancs avaient l’éclat des écus99 neufs ; au fond, la forge de Vulcain mettait un coucher d’astre. Diane, dès la seconde scène, s’entendait avec le dieu, qui devait feindre un voyage pour laisser la place libre à Vénus et à Mars. Puis, à peine Diane se trouvait-elle seule, que Vénus arrivait. Un frisson remua la salle. Nana était nue100. Elle était nue avec une tranquille audace, certaine de la toute-puissance de sa chair. Une simple gaze l’enveloppait ; ses épaules rondes, sa gorge d’amazone dont les pointes roses se tenaient levées et rigides comme des lances, ses larges hanches qui roulaient dans un balancement voluptueux, ses cuisses de blonde grasse, tout son corps se devinait, se voyait sous le tissu léger, d’une blancheur d’écume. C'était Vénus naissant des flots, n’ayant pour voile que ses cheveux101. Et, lorsque Nana levait les bras, on apercevait, aux feux de la rampe, les poils 102 d'or de ses aisselles. Il n’y eut pas d'applaudissements. Personne ne riait plus, les faces des hommes, sérieuses, se tendaient, avec le nez aminci, la bouche irritée et sans salive. Un vent semblait avoir passé très doux, chargé d’une sourde menace. Tout d’un coup, dans la bonne enfant, la femme se dressait, inquiétante, apportant le coup de folie de son sexe, ouvrant l’inconnu du désir. Nana souriait toujours, mais d’un sourire aigu de mangeuse d’hommes.","The three knocks were struck, usherettes stubbornly returning the clothes, laden with fur coats and overcoats, in the middle of the returning crowd. The slap applauded the setting, a cave on Mount Etna98, dug in a silver mine and whose sides had the shine of new shields99; in the background, the forge of Vulcan showed the setting of a star. Diana, from the second scene, got along with the god, who had to feign a trip to leave room for Venus and Mars. Then, scarcely had Diana found herself alone than Venus arrived. A shiver shook the room. Nana was naked100. She was naked with a quiet audacity, certain of the omnipotence of her flesh. A simple gauze enveloped him; her round shoulders, her bosom of Amazon whose pink points were held up and rigid like spears, her broad hips which rolled in a voluptuous swing, her fat blonde thighs, her whole body could be guessed, could be seen under the light fabric , white as foam. It was Venus rising from the waves, having no veil but her hair. And when Nana raised her arms, you could see, in the footlights, the golden hairs of her armpits. There was no applause. Nobody was laughing any more, the faces of the men, serious, tense, with the thinned nose, the irritated mouth and without saliva. A wind seemed to have passed very gently, charged with a dull threat. Suddenly, in the good child, the woman stood up, disturbing, bringing the blow of madness of her sex, opening up the unknown of desire. Nana was still smiling, but with the sharp smile of a man-eater.","The three knocks resounded throughout the house, and some of the attendants, their arms full of opera-cloaks and overcoats, were obstinately endeavouring to restore the various garments to their owners, who were hastening back to their seats. The claque applauded the scenery, which represented a grotto in Mount Etna,o hollowed out of a silver mine, with sides that glittered like newly coined crown pieces; at the back was Vulcan’s forge, with all the tints of a sunset. In the second scene Diana arranged everything with the god, who was to pretend to go on a journey so as to leave the coast clear for Venus and Mars. Then scarcely was Diana left alone, than Venus arrived. A thrill ran through the audience. Nana was next to naked. She appeared in her nakedness with a calm audacity, confident in the all-powerfulness of her flesh. A slight gauze enveloped her; her round shoulders, her amazonian breasts, the rosy tips of which stood out straight and firm as lances, her broad hips swayed by the most voluptuous movements, her plump thighs, in fact, her whole body could be divined, nay, seen, white as the foam, beneath the transparent covering. It was Venus rising from the sea, with no other veil than her locks. And when Nana raised her arms, the glare of the footlights displayed to every gaze the golden hairs of her armpits. There was no applause. No one laughed now. The grave faces of the men were bent forward, their nostrils contracted, their mouths parched and irritated. A gentle breath, laden with an unknown menace, seemed to have passed over all. Out of this laughing girl there had suddenly emerged a woman, appalling all who beheld her, crowning all the follies of her sex, displaying to the world the hidden secrets of inordinate desire. Nana still preserved her smile, but it was the mocking one of a destroyer of men.","The traditional three knocks were given, and among the returning throng, attendants, laden with pelisses and overcoats, bustled about at a great rate in order to put away people's things. The clappers applauded the scenery, which represented a grotto on Mount Etna, hollowed out in a silver mine and with sides glittering like new money. In the background Vulcan's forge glowed like a setting star. Diana, since the second act, had come to a good understanding with the god, who was to pretend that he was on a journey, so as to leave the way clear for Venus and Mars. Then scarcely was Diana alone than Venus made her appearance. A shiver of delight ran round the house. Nana was nude. With quiet audacity she appeared in her nakedness, certain of the sovereign power of her flesh. Some gauze enveloped her, but her rounded shoulders, her Amazonian bosom, her wide hips, which swayed to and fro voluptuously, her whole body, in fact, could be divined, nay discerned, in all its foamlike whiteness of tint beneath the slight fabric she wore. It was Venus rising from the waves with no veil save her tresses. And when Nana lifted her arms the golden hairs in her armpits were observable in the glare of the footlights. There was no applause. Nobody laughed any more. The men strained forward with serious faces, sharp features, mouths irritated and parched. A wind seemed to have passed, a soft, soft wind, laden with a secret menace. Suddenly in the bouncing child the woman stood discovered, a woman full of restless suggestion, who brought with her the delirium of sex and opened the gates of the unknown world of desire. Nana was smiling still, but her smile was now bitter, as of a devourer of men.","The three knocks announced the beginning of the act. Laden with furs and overcoats, the attendants were insisting on returning them to the people coming back to their seats. The claque applauded the set, a grotto on Mount Etna, deep in a silver-mine, with walls gleaming like coins fresh from the mint; at the back, Vulcan’s forge looked like a setting star. During the second scene Diana had come to an arrangement with the god, who was to pretend to be going away on a trip in order to leave the coast clear for Venus and Mars. No sooner had he left than Venus appeared. A thrill ran through the audience. Nana was naked, naked and unashamed, serenely confident in the irresistible power of her young flesh, her well-rounded shoulders, her firm breasts with their hard, erect, pink nipples which seemed to be stabbing at the audience, her broad hips rolling and swaying voluptuously, her plump golden thighs. Covered by a simple veil, her whole body could be seen, or imagined, by all through the diaphanous, white, frothy gauze. It was Venus being born out of the waves, hidden only by her hair. And when she lifted her arms, in the glare of the footlights you could glimpse the golden hair in her armpits. Now there was no clapping, and no one thought of laughing. The men had a strained, earnest look on their faces; their nostrils were taut, their mouths parched and burning. It was as if the softest of breezes had passed through, full of secret menace. This good-natured girl had suddenly become a disturbing woman offering frenzied sexuality and the arcane delights of lust. Nana was still smiling, but it was the mocking smile of a man-eater."

"Et le petit trou adorable de son menton se creusait. Elle avait son air bon enfant, sans pose, tenant la pile des écus sur sa main ouverte, l’offrant aux deux hommes comme pour leur dire : « Voyons, qui en veut ? ». Le comte fut le plus leste, il prit les cinquante francs ; mais une pièce resta, et il dut, pour l’avoir, la ramasser sur la peau même de la jeune femme, une peau tiède et souple qui lui laissa un frisson. Elle, égayée, riait toujours.","And the adorable little hole in her chin was growing. She had her good-natured air, poseless, holding the pile of crowns in her open hand, offering it to the two men as if to say to them: “Look, who wants some? "".

She, amused, was still laughing.","And an adorable little dimple appeared in her chin. She had assumed her “hail fellow well met” air, and stood in an easy posture, holding out her hand full of silver—offering it to the two men, as though saying, “Come, who’ll take?” The count was the more active, he took the money; but one coin remained in the young woman’s hand, and, to remove it, his fingers were obliged to come in contact with her skin—a skin so warm and soft that touching it sent a thrill through his frame. Nana, greatly amused, continued laughing.","And the adorable little dimple in her chin became apparent. She assumed her favorite pose, her amiable baby expression, as she held the pile of five-franc pieces on her open palm and offered it to the men, as though she were saying to them, ""Now then, who wants some?

He took fifty francs but left one piece behind and, in order to gain possession of it, had to pick it off the young woman's very skin, a moist, supple skin, the touch of which sent a thrill through him. She was thoroughly merry and did not cease laughing.","The adorable little dimple in her chin became deeper. She looked good-humoured and unpretentious as she stood holding the pile of coins in her open palm and offering them to the two men as if to say: ‘Well now, who’d like them?’ The count had the quicker reaction; he took the money but one of the coins was left in her hand and in order to pick it up, he had to touch the young woman’s skin ; it was warm and resilient; a shiver ran down his spine. She was amused and still laughing."

"Nana, debout, enveloppée dans une fourrure, attendait son entrée en causant avec ces messieurs. Comme le comte Muffat remontait pour jeter un regard sur la scène, entre deux châssis, il comprit, à un geste du régisseur, qu’il devait marcher doucement. Une paix chaude tombait du cintre. Dans les coulisses, éclairées de violentes nappes de lumière, de rares personnes, parlant à voix basse, stationnaient, s’en allaient sur la pointe des pieds. Le gazier 43 était à son poste, près du jeu compliqué des robinets ; un pompier, appuyé contre un portant, tâchait de voir, en allongeant la tête ; pendant que, tout en haut, sur son banc, l’homme du rideau veillait, l’air résigné, ignorant la pièce, toujours dans l’attente du coup de sonnette pour la manœuvre de ses cordages. Et, au milieu de cet air étouffé, de ces piétinements et de ces chuchotements, la voix des acteurs en scène arrivait étrange, assourdie, une voix dont la fausseté surprenait. Puis, c’était, plus loin, au-delà des bruits confus de l’orchestre, comme une immense haleine, la salle qui respirait et dont le souffle se gonflait parfois, éclatant en rumeurs, en rires, en applaudissements. On sentait le public sans le voir, même dans ses silences.","Nana, standing, wrapped in a fur, was waiting for him to come in, chatting with these gentlemen. As Count Muffat came back up to take a look at the stage, between two frames, he understood, from a gesture from the stage manager, that he must walk slowly. A warm peace fell from the hanger. Behind the scenes, lit by violent sheets of light, a few people, speaking in low voices, stood, went away on tiptoe. Gasman 43 was at his post, near the complicated set of taps; a fireman, leaning against a rack, was trying to see, stretching out his head; while, at the very top, on his bench, the man behind the curtain watched, with a resigned air, ignoring the room, still waiting for the bell to ring for the operation of his ropes. And, in the midst of this stifled air, this trampling and these whisperings, the voices of the actors on stage came strange, muffled, a voice whose falsity was surprising. Then it was, further on, beyond the confused noises of the orchestra, like an immense breath, the room which breathed and whose breath sometimes swelled, bursting into rumors, laughter, applause. We felt the public without seeing it, even in its silences.","Nana, wrapped in a fur cloak, stood talking to the gentlemen while she waited for her cue. As Count Muffat advanced to obtain a view of the stage between two side scenes, he understood from a sign of the stage-manager that he must tread softly. All was quiet up above. In the wings, which were most brilliantly lighted up, a few persons were standing talking in whispers, or moving off on tiptoe. The gas-man was at his post, close to the complicated collection of taps; a fireman, leaning against one of the supports, was stretching his neck trying to get a glimpse of the performance; whilst the man who manœuvred the curtain was waiting on his seat up aloft, with a resigned look on his countenance, quite ignoring the piece and merely listening for the bell which directed his movements. And, in the midst of this stifling atmosphere and the faint noise caused by the light footsteps and the low whispers, the sound of the voices of the actors on the stage seemed strange and hushed, and surprisingly out of tune. Then, farther off, beyond the din of the orchestra, there was the audience breathing as with one immense respiration, which now and again swelled as it broke out in murmurs, laughter, and applause. One could feel the public without seeing it, even when it was silent.","Nana was standing wrapped in furs, talking to these gentlemen while awaiting her cue. As Count Muffat was coming up in order to peep between two of the wings at the stage, he understood from a sign made him by the stage manager that he was to step softly. Drowsy warmth was streaming down from the flies, and in the wings, which were lit by vivid patches of light, only a few people remained, talking in low voices or making off on tiptoe. The gasman was at his post amid an intricate arrangement of cocks; a fireman, leaning against the side lights, was craning forward, trying to catch a glimpse of things, while on his seat, high up, the curtain man was watching with resigned expression, careless of the play, constantly on the alert for the bell to ring him to his duty among the ropes. And amid the close air and the shuffling of feet and the sound of whispering, the voices of the actors on the stage sounded strange, deadened, surprisingly discordant. Farther off again, above the confused noises of the band, a vast breathing sound was audible. It was the breath of the house, which sometimes swelled up till it burst in vague rumors, in laughter, in applause. Though invisible, the presence of the public could be felt, even in the silences.","Nana was standing in her fur coat chatting to the gentlemen and waiting for her cue. As Count Muffat was moving across to take a quick look at the stage between two pieces of scenery, the stage-manager signalled to him to walk quietly. A soothing warmth was coming down from the rigging-loft. In the wings, chequered in vivid patches of light, a few people stood talking before tiptoeing away. The gasman was at his post beside his complicated array of taps; a fireman was leaning against a flat, craning his neck to watch; and at the very top, the curtain-raiser was sitting resignedly on his bench, knowing nothing about the performance, just waiting for the bell before operating his ropes. In the middle of this suffocating atmosphere, full of whispers and the trampling of feet, you could hear the voices of the actors on stage, odd, muffled voices, strangely distorted. In the distance, beyond the confused sound of the orchestra, there was the vast, slow murmur of the auditorium, a sighing breath which now and again swelled to a roar of laughter or applause. Even when they were silent you could sense the presence of the audience."

"Ce ton n’était ni dans son tempérament ni dans ses habitudes. Elle fut plus étonnée que blessée. Lui, d’ailleurs, restait honteux ; et, comme elle le priait sèchement d’être poli, il s’excusa. Depuis quelque temps, il avait ainsi de brusques changements d’humeur. Personne n’ignorait, dans le Paris galant et mondain, qu’il jouait ce jour-là son dernier coup de cartes. Si ses chevaux ne gagnaient pas, s’ils lui emportaient encore les sommes considérables pariées sur eux, c’était un désastre, un écroulement ; l’échafaudage de son crédit, les hautes apparences que gardait son existence minée par-dessous, comme vidée par le désordre et la dette, s’abîmaient dans une ruine retentissante. Et Nana, personne non plus ne l’ignorait, était la mangeuse d’hommes qui avait achevé celui-là, venue la dernière dans cette fortune ébranlée, nettoyant la place. On racontait des caprices fous, de l’or semé au vent, une partie à Bade 38 où elle ne lui avait pas laissé de quoi payer l’hôtel, une poignée de diamants jetés sur un brasier, un soir d’ivresse, pour voir si ça brûlait comme du charbon. Peu à peu, avec ses gros membres, ses rires canailles de faubourienne, elle s’était imposée à ce fils, si appauvri et si fin, d’une antique race. À cette heure, il risquait tout, si envahi par son goût du bête et du sale, qu’il avait perdu jusqu’à la force de son scepticisme. Huit jours auparavant, elle s’était fait promettre un château sur la côte normande, entre Le Havre et Trouville ; et il mettait son dernier honneur à tenir parole. Seulement, elle l’agaçait, il l’aurait battue, tant il la sentait stupide.","This tone was neither in his temperament nor in his habits. She was more surprised than hurt. He, moreover, remained ashamed; and, as she curtly begged him to be polite, he excused himself. For some time now he had had sudden mood swings. No one was unaware, in gallant and worldly Paris, that he was playing his last card trick that day. If his horses did not win, if they still carried off the considerable sums bet on them, it was a disaster, a collapse; the scaffolding of his credit, the lofty appearances which his existence preserved, undermined below, as if emptied by disorder and debt, were sinking into resounding ruin. And Nana, no one ignored it either, was the man-eater who had finished off this one, who had come last to this shaken fortune, clearing the place. There were stories of mad whims, of gold sown in the wind, of a game in Baden-Thirties where she hadn't left him enough to pay for the hotel, a handful of diamonds thrown on a brazier, one drunken evening, to see if it burned like coal. Little by little, with her big limbs, her rascal suburban laughter, she had imposed herself on this son, so impoverished and so shrewd, of an ancient race. At this hour he was risking everything, so overwhelmed by his taste for the stupid and the dirty that he had lost even the strength of his skepticism. Eight days before, she had been promised a castle on the Normandy coast, between Le Havre and Trouville; and he made it his last honor to keep his word. Only, she annoyed him, he would have beaten her, he thought she was so stupid.","This way of speaking was neither in accordance with his usual temper or habits. She felt more surprised than hurt. He, too, felt ashamed of himself; and, as she stiffly requested him to be more polite, he apologised. For some little time past he had been subject to these sudden fits of temper. No one belonging to the gallant world of Paris ignored that on that day he was playing his last cards. If his horses did not win, if they lost him the considerable sums for which he had backed them, it would be not only a disaster, but a regular collapse; the scaffolding of his credit, the grand appearances which his undermined existence, destroyed by disorders and debts, preserved, would tumble and noise his ruin abroad. And Nana, as everyone also knew, was the man-destroyer who had finished him, who had been the last to attack that already damaged fortune, and had cleared off all that remained. The maddest caprices imaginable were related—gold thrown to the winds, an excursion to Baden, where she had not even left him the money to pay the hotel bill, a handful of diamonds flung into the fire one night of intoxication, to see if they would burn like coal. Little by little, with her big limbs and her noisy vulgar laughter, she had taken complete possession of that heir, so impoverished and so cunning, of an ancient race. At that hour he was risking his all, overpowered by a taste for what was vile and idiotic, that he had even lost the strength of his scepticism. Eight days before she had made him promise her a château on the Normandy coast, between Havre and Trouville; and he made it a point of honour to keep his word. Only, she preyed on his nerves; he thought her so stupid that he could have beaten her.","Such a tone was not germane either to his temperament or his habits, and Nana was rather surprised than wounded. Besides, he was ashamed of himself directly afterward, and when she begged him in a dry voice to behave politely he apologized. For some time past he had suffered from such sudden changes of temper. No one in the Paris of pleasure or of society was ignorant of the fact that he was playing his last trump card today. If his horses did not win, if, moreover, they lost him the considerable sums wagered upon them, it would mean utter disaster and collapse for him, and the bulwark of his credit and the lofty appearance which, though undermined, he still kept up, would come ruining noisily down. Moreover, no one was ignorant of the fact that Nana was the devouring siren who had finished him off, who had been the last to attack his crumbling fortunes and to sweep up what remained of them. Stories were told of wild whims and fancies, of gold scattered to the four winds, of a visit to Baden- Baden, where she had not left him enough to pay the hotel bill, of a handful of diamonds cast on the fire during an evening of drunkenness in order to see whether they would burn like coal. Little by little her great limbs and her coarse, plebeian way of laughing had gained complete mastery over this elegant, degenerate son of an ancient race. At that time he was risking his all, for he had been so utterly overpowered by his taste for ordure and stupidity as to have even lost the vigor of his skepticism. A week before Nana had made him promise her a chateau on the Norman coast between Havre and Trouville, and now he was staking the very foundations of his honor on the fulfillment of his word. Only she was getting on his nerves, and he could have beaten her, so stupid did he feel her to be.","Such a tone was unusual and quite out of character. She was more surprised than hurt. He himself was looking ashamed, and when she sharply asked him to mind his manners he apologized. He’d been suffering from this sort of moodiness for some time now. In the smart, raffish circles in which he moved everybody was aware that this was his last fling. If his horses didn’t win, if they once again failed to bring home, with interest, the vast sums which he’d been putting on them, it would be a catastrophe, a complete collapse; the whole basis of his credit and grand style of life, undermined and at its last gasp as a result of his debt-ridden and rackety existence, would be demolished in a spectacular crash. And everyone knew equally well that one particular gold-digger, the last in line of all those who’d been gnawing away at his fortune, would suck him dry and throw away the pieces. There were tales of crazy whims, of immense sums tossed airily away, a party at Baden where she hadn’t left him with enough to pay the hotel, of one drunken night when she’d thrown a handful of diamonds on to a brazier to discover if they burned like coal. Little by little, the sturdy limbs and vulgar gutter laugh had brought this over-civilized, impoverished scion of an ancient family to his knees, and now he’d been so corrupted by his taste for stupidity and squalor that he’d even lost his capacity for scepticism and was risking everything. A week ago she’d got him to promise her a château on the Normandy coast between Trouville and Le Havre and he had made it a final point of honour to keep his word, even though she got on his nerves and he found her so stupid that he could have thrashed her."
"Elle répéta, malgré la claque, et il tomba sur elle, à coups de pied et à coups de poing.

But all his illusions had vanished, and he no longer believed in her sworn fidelity. Next day Nana would deceive him anew, and he only remained her miserable possessor in obedience to a cowardly necessity and to terror at the thought of living without her.","The count allowed himself to be persuaded, insisting on one thing only: Georges must go. But all his illusions had been shattered; he no longer trusted her promises to be faithful. Tomorrow, Nana would be going to bed with some other man.

"« Puis, continuait la tante, tu n’as connu que des personnes distinguées... Justement, nous causions de ça hier, avec Zoé, chez moi. Elle non plus ne comprend pas.

Enfin, il n’a rien pour lui. Je ne le voudrais pas dans ma chambre en peinture.

Suffit ! ce n’est pas moi qui dois dire ces choses. Mais, à la première saleté, je te le planterais là, avec un : « Monsieur, pour qui me prenez-vous ? » tu sais, de ton grand air, qui lui couperait bras et jambes. »","""Then,"" continued the aunt, ""you've only known distinguished people... We were just talking about that yesterday with Zoé at my house."" She doesn't understand either. How, she said, Madame who was leading Monsieur le Comte, such a perfect man, both finger and eye, — for, between us, it seems that you were driving him crazy, — how can Madame let herself massacred by this puppet? Me, I added that the blows could still be tolerated, but that I would never have suffered lack of respect... Well, he has nothing for him. I wouldn't want it in my painting room. And you ruin yourself for such a bird; yes, you ruin yourself, my darling, you stick out your tongue, when there are so many of them, and the richest, and government personages... Enough! it is not for me to say these things.

We were just talking about it last night at home with Zoé. She can’t understand either why you put up with all this. ‘How,’ said she, ‘can madame, who could do just as she pleased with the count’—for between ourselves you appear to have treated him as though he were a donkey—‘ how can madame allow herself to be massacred by that ugly clown?’ I added that slaps might even be borne, but that I would never have submitted to such a want of respect. In short, he has nothing whatever in his favour. I wouldn’t have his portrait in my room on any account. And you are ruining yourself for such a sorry bird as he is; yes, you are ruining yourself, my darling. You are going about in want of everything, when there are so many others, and far richer ones too, and gentlemen connected with the government. But that’s enough! it’s not I who ought to tell you all this. However, were I in your place, the very next time he treated me ill, I’d leave him to himself, with a ‘Sir, whom do you take me for?’ said in your grand style, you know, which would show him you were not going to be made a fool of any longer.”","""Then, too,"" continued the aunt, ""you've only known perfect gentlemen hitherto. We were talking of that very topic with Zoe at my place yesterday evening. She can't understand it any more than I can. ' How is it,' she said, 'that Madame, who used to have that perfect gentleman, Monsieur le Comte, at her beck and call'--for between you and me, it seems you drove him silly--'how is it that Madame lets herself be made into mincemeat by that clown of a fellow?' I remarked at the time that you might put up with the beatings but that I would never have allowed him to be lacking in proper respect. In fact, there isn't a word to be said for him. I wouldn't have his portrait in my room even! And you ruin yourself for such a bird as that; yes, you ruin yourself, my darling; you toil and you moil, when there are so many others and such rich men, too, some of them even connected with the government! Ah well, it's not I who ought to be telling you this, of course! But all the same, when next he tries any of his dirty tricks on I should cut him short with a 'Monsieur, what d'you take me for?'

It would downright cripple him.""","‘And you never knew any but the very best society … We were only talking about that yesterday evening with Zoé, at my place.

And here you are, ruining yourself for a real bad lot like that, yes, my darling, you’re ruining yourself, you’re nearly at the end of your tether, when there are so many others as rich as they come and bigwigs in the government, too. Well, I’ve said enough, it’s not my job to tell you what to do, but the first time he does the dirty on you I’d dump him just like that, with a “Who do you think I am”, you know , very grand-like, I’ve seen you do it before, and leave him high and dry.’"

"Alors, les deux cousins cherchèrent les figures de connaissance. Mignon et Steiner étaient ensemble, dans une baignoire, les poignets appuyés sur le velours de la rampe, côte à côte. Blanche de Sivry semblait occuper à elle seule une avant-scène du rez-de-chaussée. Mais la Faloise examina surtout Daguenet, qui avait un fauteuil d’orchestre, deux rangs en avant du sien. Près de lui, un tout jeune homme, de dix-sept ans au plus, quelque échappé du collège, ouvrait très grands ses beaux yeux de chérubin26. Fauchery eut un sourire en le regardant.","So the two cousins looked for the figures of acquaintance. Mignon and Steiner were together, in a bathtub, their wrists resting on the velvet banister, side by side. Blanche de Sivry seemed to occupy a proscenium on the ground floor alone. But La Faloise especially examined Daguenet, who had an orchestra chair, two rows in front of his. Near him, a very young man, seventeen at the most, some dropout from college, was opening his beautiful cherubic eyes very wide. Fauchery smiled as he looked at him.","Then the two cousins looked around in search of acquaintances. Mignon and Steiner sat side by side in a box, with their arms resting on the velvet balustrade. Blanche de Sivry appeared to be alone in one of the stage-boxes. But La Faloise watched more especially Daguenet, who had an orchestra stall two rows in front of his. Next to him was seated a youngster, some seventeen years old, just fresh from college, who opened his cherub-like eyes wide with delight. Fauchery smiled as he caught sight of him.","It was now that the two cousins began searching for the faces of those they knew. Mignon and Steiner were together in a lower box, sitting side by side with their arms leaning for support on the velvet balustrade. Blanche de Sivry seemed to be in sole possession of a stage box on the level of the stalls. But La Faloise examined Daguenet before anyone else, he being in occupation of a stall two rows in front of his own. Close to him, a very young man, seventeen years old at the outside, some truant from college, it may be, was straining wide a pair of fine eyes such as a cherub might have owned. Fauchery smiled when he looked at him.","The two cousins were looking for familiar faces. Mignon and Steiner were together, side by side in a ground-floor box, resting their wrists on the velvet-covered rails. Blanche de Sivry seemed to have a stage box all to herself. But la Faloise was particularly interested in Daguenet, who was in an orchestra stall two rows in front of his own. Next to him sat a very young man, 17 at the most, a schoolboy playing truant; he had the look of a little cherub, with superb eyes which were popping out of his head."
"Un critique disait qu’il faudrait joliment couper là-dedans. La pièce importait peu, d’ailleurs ; on causait surtout de Nana. Fauchery et la Faloise, sortis des premiers, se rencontrèrent dans le couloir de l’orchestre avec Steiner et Mignon. On étouffait dans ce boyau, étroit et écrasé comme une galerie de mine, que des lampes à gaz éclairaient. Ils restèrent un instant au pied de l’escalier de droite, protégés par le retour de la rampe. Les spectateurs des petites places descendaient avec un bruit continu de gros souliers, le flot des habits noirs passait, tandis qu’une ouvreuse faisait tous ses efforts pour protéger, contre les poussées, une chaise sur laquelle elle avait empilé des vêtements.","A reviewer said that it would be nice to cut in there. The room didn't matter much; we talked above all about Nana. Fauchery and La Faloise, coming out of the first, met in the corridor of the orchestra with Steiner and Mignon. We were suffocating in this trench, narrow and flattened like a mine gallery, which was lit by gas lamps. They remained for a moment at the foot of the staircase on the right, protected by the return of the banister. The spectators in the little squares descended with a continuous noise of heavy shoes, the flood of black coats passed, while an usherette made every effort to protect a chair on which she had piled clothes from being pushed.","A critic observed that the piece wanted a great deal of cutting down. But the piece, after all, mattered little. Nana was the chief topic of conversation. Fauchery and La Faloise, who were among the first to leave their seats, met Steiner and Mignon in the passage leading to the stalls. The atmosphere was stifling in this hole, which was low and narrow like some gallery in a mine, and was lighted here and there by flaring gas-jets. They stood for a moment at the foot of the staircase on the right, protected by the railing. The spectators from the upper part of the house tramped down with a great noise of heavy shoes, the procession of men in evening dress seemed as though it would never cease, and a box-opener endeavoured to prevent a chair on which she had piled coats and shawls from being swept away by the crowd.","A critic was saying that it would be one's duty to do a pretty bit of slashing. The piece, however, mattered very little, for people were talking about Nana before everything else. Fauchery and La Faloise, being among the earliest to emerge, met Steiner and Mignon in the passage outside the stalls. In this gaslit gut of a place, which was as narrow and circumscribed as a gallery in a mine, one was well-nigh suffocated. They stopped a moment at the foot of the stairs on the right of the house, protected by the final curve of the balusters. The audience from the cheap places were coming down the steps with a continuous tramp of heavy boots; a stream of black dress coats was passing, while an attendant was making every possible effort to protect a chair, on which she had piled up coats and cloaks, from the onward pushing of the crowd.","A critic was heard to say that they’d need to make a good few cuts. Anyway, the play itself didn’t much matter: people were above all talking about Nana. Fauchery and la Faloise were among the first out, and in the stalls corridor they met Steiner and Mignon. It was stifling in the passage, which was lit by gas and as low and narrow as the gallery of a coal-mine. They stood for a minute at the foot of the right-hand staircase, protected by the curving handrail. The people from the cheaper seats were steadily thudding their way down the stairs in their heavy shoes; there was a constant stream of white ties; meanwhile an attendant was trying hard to prevent a chair which she’d piled up with clothes from being overturned."

"Elle était allée ouvrir la porte. Il ne sortit pas. Maintenant, c’était sa façon de l’attacher davantage ; pour un rien, à la moindre querelle, elle lui mettait le marché en main, avec des réflexions abominables. Ah bien ! elle trouverait toujours mieux que lui, elle avait l’embarras du choix ; on ramassait des hommes dehors, tant qu’on en voulait, et des hommes moins godiches, dont le sang bouillait dans les veines. Il baissait la tête, il attendait des heures plus douces, lorsqu’elle avait un besoin d’argent ; alors, elle se faisait caressante ; et il oubliait, une nuit de tendresse compensait les tortures de toute la semaine. Son rapprochement avec sa femme lui avait rendu son intérieur insupportable. La comtesse, lâchée par Fauchery, qui retombait sous l’empire de Rose34, s’étourdissait à d’autres amours, dans le coup de fièvre inquiet de la quarantaine, toujours nerveuse, emplissant l’hôtel du tourbillon exaspérant de sa vie. Estelle, depuis son mariage, ne voyait plus son père ; chez cette fille, plate et insignifiante, une femme d’une volonté de fer avait brusquement paru, si absolue, que Daguenet tremblait devant elle ; maintenant, il l’accompagnait à la messe, converti, furieux contre son beau-père qui les ruinait avec une créature. Seul, M. Venot restait tendre pour le comte, guettant son heure ; même il en était arrivé à s’introduire chez Nana, il fréquentait les deux maisons, où l’on rencontrait derrière les portes son continuel sourire. Et Muffat, misérable chez lui, chassé par l’ennui et la honte, préférait encore vivre avenue de Villiers, au milieu des injures.","She had gone to open the door. He did not come out. Now, it was his way of tying her down more; for nothing, at the slightest quarrel, she put the deal in his hand, with abominable reflections.

He lowered his head, he waited for sweeter hours, when she needed money; then she became caressing; and he forgot, a night of tenderness compensated for the tortures of the whole week. His rapprochement with his wife had made his interior unbearable. The Countess, abandoned by Fauchery, who was once again falling under the sway of Rose34, was bewildered by other loves, in the restless fit of quarantine fever, always nervous, filling the hotel with the exasperating whirlwind of her life. Estelle, since her marriage, no longer saw her father; in this girl, dull and insignificant, a woman of iron will had suddenly appeared so absolute that Daguenet trembled before her; now he accompanied her to mass, converted, furious at his father-in-law who was ruining them with a creature. Alone, M. Venot remained tender for the Count, watching his hour; he had even managed to get into Nana's house, he frequented both houses, where one met his continual smile behind the doors. And Muffat, miserable at home, driven away by boredom and shame, still preferred to live on the avenue de Villiers, amid insults.","She had gone and opened the door. He did not go. So now it became her way of attaching him to her all the more; for nothing at all, at the least quarrel, she gave him his choice, accompanied by some of the most abominable reflections. Ah, well! she would always be able to find some one better than he, she had only too many people to choose from; one could pick up men outside, as many as one wanted, and fellows who were not such ninnies as he, whose blood boiled in their veins. He bowed his head, he waited for better times, when she would be in want of money; then she became caressing, and he forgot everything—a night of love compensated for the tortures of a week. His reconciliation with his wife had made his home unbearable. The countess, cast off by Fauchery, who was once more completely under Rose’s influence, sought forgetfulness in other amours, in the attack of the feverish anxiety of her forty years, ever nervous, and filling the house with the exasperating commotion of her mode of living. Since her marriage, Estelle no longer saw her father. This skinny and insignificant looking girl had suddenly developed into a woman with an iron will so absolute that Daguenet trembled before her; now he accompanied her to church, converted, and furious with his father-in-law, who was ruining them with an abandoned female. M. Venot alone remained affectionate towards the count, whilst biding his time. He had even succeeded in gaining access to Nana; he frequented the two houses, where one often came across his continual smile behind the doors. And Muffat, miserable in his own home, driven from thence by dulness and shame, preferred rather to live amidst the insults of the Avenue de Villiers.","She had gone and opened the door, but he did not leave. That was her way now of binding him more closely to her. For no reason whatever, at the slightest approach to a quarrel she would tell him he might stop or go as he liked, and she would accompany her permission with a flood of odious reflections. She said she could always find better than he; she had only too many from whom to choose; men in any quantity could be picked up in the street, and men a good deal smarter, too, whose blood boiled in their veins. At this he would hang his head and wait for those gentler moods when she wanted money. She would then become affectionate, and he would forget it all, one night of tender dalliance making up for the tortures of a whole week. His reconciliation with his wife had rendered his home unbearable. Fauchery, having again fallen under Rose's dominion, the countess was running madly after other loves. She was entering on the forties, that restless, feverish time in the life of women, and ever hysterically nervous, she now filled her mansion with the maddening whirl of her fashionable life. Estelle, since her marriage, had seen nothing of her father; the undeveloped, insignificant girl had suddenly become a woman of iron will, so imperious withal that Daguenet trembled in her presence. In these days he accompanied her to mass: he was converted, and he raged against his father-in-law for ruining them with a courtesan. M. Venot alone still remained kindly inclined toward the count, for he was biding his time. He had even succeeded in getting into Nana's immediate circle. In fact, he frequented both houses, where you encountered his continual smile behind doors. So Muffat, wretched at home, driven out by ennui and shame, still preferred to live in the Avenue de Villiers, even though he was abused there.","She went over to the door and opened it. He stayed; and this became her way of attaching him to her more and more; at the slightest disagreement she’d renew her offer, in the most offensive terms: she’d not have any trouble replacing him with someone better, never fear , she could have her pick; and they’d be men with real blood in their veins, not old fusspots. He would cringe and hope for better times, when she’d be in need of money and full of affection; and then, for one night of love that made up for a whole week of martyrdom, he could forget everything. His reconciliation with his wife had made life at home a hell. Abandoned by Fauchery, who’d once more fallen into Rose’s clutches, the countess was trying to forget by launching into a series of love-affairs; and in her feverish anxiety as a woman nearing 40 she was constantly on edge and turning their home into a bedlam of mad activity. Since her marriage, Estelle had stopped seeing her father; this insignificant beanpole of a woman had suddenly been transformed into an iron-willed termagant, so domineering that Daguenet was terrified of her. He had been converted and now went to Mass with his wife, and was furious with his father-in-law who was ruining them for the sake of a worthless creature. The only person showing the count some sort of kindness was Monsieur Venot, who was biding his time. He had even managed to worm his way into the Avenue de Villiers, and his permanent smile could be seen smirking behind the doors of Nana’s house as well as Sabine’s. So, driven out of his own home by shame and boredom, the wretched Muffat still preferred life with Nana, where he was being constantly insulted."

"« Bon ! voilà le baiser, dit Fauchery triomphant. Encore une fois, le baiser... Vois-tu, Rose, j’ai eu le temps de passer, et je jette alors un léger cri : « Ah ! elle l’a embrassé. » Mais, pour cela, il faut que Tardiveau remonte... Entendez-vous, Fontan, vous remontez...

"Plusieurs personnes s’en allaient. Il était près de minuit. Deux valets enlevaient sans bruit les tasses vides et les assiettes de gâteaux. Devant la cheminée, ces dames avaient reformé et rétréci leur cercle, causant avec plus d’abandon dans la langueur de cette fin de soirée. Le salon lui-même s’ensommeillait, des ombres lentes tombaient des murs. Alors, Fauchery parla de se retirer. Pourtant, il s’oubliait de nouveau à regarder la comtesse Sabine. Elle se reposait de ses soins de maîtresse de maison, à sa place accoutumée, muette, les yeux sur un tison qui se consumait en braise, le visage si blanc et si fermé, qu’il était repris de doute. Dans la lueur du foyer, les poils noirs du signe qu’elle avait au coin des lèvres blondissaient. Absolument le signe de Nana, jusqu’à la couleur. Il ne put s’empêcher d’en dire un mot à l’oreille de Vandeuvres. C'était ma foi vrai ; jamais celui-ci ne l’avait remarqué. Et tous les deux continuèrent le parallèle entre Nana et la comtesse. Ils leur trouvaient une vague ressemblance dans le menton et dans la bouche ; mais les yeux n’étaient pas du tout pareils. Puis, Nana avait l’air bonne fille ; tandis qu’on ne savait pas avec la comtesse, on aurait dit une chatte qui dormait, les griffes rentrées, les pattes à peines agitées d’un frisson nerveux.","Several people were leaving. It was nearly midnight. Two valets noiselessly removed the empty cups and the plates of cake. In front of the fireplace, these ladies had reformed and narrowed their circle, chatting with more abandon in the languor of this late evening. The living room itself was falling asleep, slow shadows falling from the walls. Then Fauchery spoke of retiring. Yet he forgot himself again, gazing at the Countess Sabine. She was resting from her cares as mistress of the house, in her accustomed place, mute, her eyes on a brand that was burning to embers, her face so white and so closed that it was once more doubtful. In the glow of the fireplace, the black hairs of the sign at the corner of her lips were turning blond. Absolutely the sign of Nana, down to the color. He could not refrain from whispering a word in Vandeuvres' ear. It was my faith true; he had never noticed it. And both continued the parallel between Nana and the Countess. They found a vague resemblance to them in the chin and in the mouth; but the eyes were not at all the same. Then, Nana looked like a good girl; while one did not know with the Countess, she looked like a sleeping cat, her claws drawn in, her paws barely moving with a nervous shiver.","Several persons were leaving. It was close upon midnight. Two footmen silently removed the empty cups and the plates of cake. The ladies were still sitting in front of the fire, though in a smaller circle than before, conversing more freely in the languor of the end of an evening. Even the room itself seemed overcome with drowsiness, and heavy shadows lingered about the walls. Then Fauchery talked of retiring. However, his eyes once more sought Countess Sabine. Having seen to her guests, she was now resting in her accustomed seat, saying nothing, her glance fixed on a log that was gradually burning away, and her face so white and impenetrable, that his doubts returned to him. The little black hairs on the mark she had near the corner of her mouth seemed quite golden in the fire-light—exactly the same as Nana’s even to the colour. He could not resist whispering to Vandeuvres about it. It was really quite true, he had never noticed it before; and they continued the parallel between Nana and the countess. They discovered a vague resemblance about the chin and the mouth; but the eyes were not at all alike. There Nana looked thoroughly kind-hearted and good-natured; whilst the countess was altogether doubtful—one would have said a cat asleep, with her claws hidden away, and her paws only slightly agitated with a nervous tremble.","Several people were taking their departure. It was close on midnight. Two footmen were noiselessly removing the empty cups and the plates with cakes. In front of the hearth the ladies had re- formed and, at the same time, narrowed their circle and were chatting more carelessly than before in the languid atmosphere peculiar to the close of a party. The very room was going to sleep, and slowly creeping shadows were cast by its walls. It was then Fauchery spoke of departure. Yet he once more forgot his intention at sight of the Countess Sabine. She was resting from her cares as hostess, and as she sat in her wonted seat, silent, her eyes fixed on a log which was turning into embers, her face appeared so white and so impassable that doubt again possessed him. In the glow of the fire the small black hairs on the mole at the corner of her lip became white. It was Nana's very mole, down to the color of the hair. He could not refrain from whispering something about it in Vandeuvres's ear. Gad, it was true; the other had never noticed it before. And both men continued this comparison of Nana and the countess. They discovered a vague resemblance about the chin and the mouth, but the eyes were not at all alike. Then, too, Nana had a good-natured expression, while with the countess it was hard to decide--she might have been a cat, sleeping with claws withdrawn and paws stirred by a scarce-perceptible nervous quiver.","A number of guests were leaving. It was nearly midnight. Two footmen were silently collecting the empty cups and plates. In front of the fire, the ladies had formed a smaller circle. The evening was drawing to a close, the conversation was becoming freer, people felt more relaxed. Even the drawing-room was drowsy, the walls shrouded in gentle shadows. Fauchery talked of leaving, but when he looked at Countess Sabine he started day-dreaming again. She was relaxing from her duties as hostess, sitting silently in her usual place, staring at a glowing ember; her face was so white, so inscrutable, that once more he was seized by doubt. In the glow of the fire the black hairs sprouting from the mole in the corner of her mouth looked blonde. Exactly like Nana’s, even to the colour! He couldn’t resist making a whispered comment to Vandeuvres. Good Lord, that was right! Vandeuvres had never noticed it before. And the pair explored the comparison further: they thought there was a vague similarity between the chin and mouth, but the eyes were quite different; moreover, Nana looked cheerful and good-natured whereas you couldn’t tell with the countess, she was rather like a cat with her claws retracted and her paws quivering slightly in a nervous twitch."
"— Ah ! non ! dit-il, pour attraper du mal ! »","- Oh! Nope ! he said, to catch the pain! »","“Ah, no!” said he, “not to get ill!”","""Oh dear, no! To catch something horrid?"" he said.",‘You must be joking!’ he replied. ‘Why run the risk of catching something?’
"Les courses s’achevaient, on courait le prix Vaublanc. Des voitures partaient, une à une. Cependant, le nom de Vandeuvres revenait, au milieu de querelles. Maintenant, c’était clair : Vandeuvres, depuis deux ans, ménageait son coup, en chargeant Gresham de retenir Nana ; et il n’avait produit Lusignan que pour faire le jeu de la pouliche. Les perdants se fâchaient, tandis que les gagnants haussaient les épaules. Après ? n’était-ce pas permis ? Un propriétaire conduisait son écurie comme il l’entendait. On en avait bien vu d’autres ! Le plus grand nombre trouvait Vandeuvres très fort d’avoir fait ramasser par des amis tout ce qu’il avait pu prendre sur Nana, ce qui expliquait la hausse brusque de la cote ; on parlait de deux mille louis, à trente en moyenne, douze cent mille francs de gain, un chiffre dont l’ampleur frappait de respect et excusait tout.","The races were over, we were running the Vaublanc prize. Cars were leaving, one by one. However, the name of Vandeuvres came back, in the middle of quarrels. Now it was clear: Vandeuvres, for two years, had been sparing his hand, by instructing Gresham to detain Nana; and he had produced Lusignan only to play the game of the filly. The losers got angry, while the winners shrugged their shoulders. After ? wasn't that allowed? An owner led his stable as he saw fit. We had seen many others! The greatest number found Vandeuvres very fortunate to have had friends pick up everything he had been able to take on Nana, which explained the sudden rise in the price; they were talking about two thousand louis, at an average of thirty, twelve hundred thousand francs of gain, a figure the magnitude of which struck with respect and excused everything.","The races were drawing to a close; they were now running for the Vaublanc Prize. Vehicles were departing one by one. Vandeuvres’s name was frequently uttered in the midst of squabbles. Now, it was clear. For two years past, Vandeuvres had been preparing for this exploit by always instructing Gresham to pull Nana; and he had only produced Lusignan to make the running for the filly The losers lost their tempers, whilst the winners shrugged their shoulders. What next? it was all right. An owner could manage his stable as he chose. There had been much queerer things done than that! The greater number of people considered Vandeuvres very smart, to have secured through his friends all he could possibly get on Nana, which had explained the sudden rise in her price; they talked of two thousand louis, at an average of thirty to one, which meant a gain of twelve hundred thousand francs, a sum so large that it commanded respect, and excused everything.","The races were ending, and the Prix Vaublanc was run for. Carriages began driving off one by one. Meanwhile, amid much disputing, the name of Vandeuvres was again mentioned. It was quite evident now: for two years past Vandeuvres had been preparing his final stroke and had accordingly told Gresham to hold Nana in, while he had only brought Lusignan forward in order to make play for the filly. The losers were vexed; the winners shrugged their shoulders. After all, wasn't the thing permissible? An owner was free to run his stud in his own way. Many others had done as he had! In fact, the majority thought Vandeuvres had displayed great skill in raking in all he could get about Nana through the agency of friends, a course of action which explained the sudden shortening of the odds. People spoke of his having laid two thousand louis on the horse, which, supposing the odds to be thirty to one against, gave him twelve hundred thousand francs, an amount so vast as to inspire respect and to excuse everything.","The last race, the Vaublanc Stakes, was being run. Carriages were leaving one by one. A good deal of squabbling seemed to be going on and Vandeuvres’s name kept being mentioned. It now became quite plain that the count had been planning his coup for a couple of years: he’d been instructing Gresham to hold Nana back and had been running Lusignan merely to overshadow the filly. The people who’d lost money were annoyed, those who’d won were shrugging their shoulders: so what? Was it in any way illegal? An owner managed his stud as he thought fit! He wasn’t the only one, by a long chalk! Most people thought Vandeuvres had been very smart to have got his friends to pick up what he’d put on Nana, which explained the sudden drop in the odds; there was talk of two thousand louis having been put on, at an average of thirty-to-one, thereby netting one million two-hundred thousand francs; an astronomical sum like that didn’t need excuses."

"Elle promenait ses regards. Mais elle devint sérieuse, comme étonnée de ne pas trouver quelqu’un là. Sans doute il manquait un convive dont elle ne parlait point. Il fallait attendre. Quelques minutes plus tard, les invités aperçurent au milieu d’eux un grand monsieur, à figure noble et à belle barbe blanche. Et le plus surprenant était que personne ne l’avait vu entrer ; il devait s’être glissé dans le petit salon par une porte de la chambre à coucher, restée entrouverte. Un silence régna, des chuchotements couraient. Le comte de Vandeuvres savait certainement qui était le monsieur, car ils avaient tous deux échangé une discrète poignée de main ; mais il répondit par un sourire aux questions des femmes. Alors, Caroline Héquet, à demi-voix, paria pour un lord anglais, qui retournait le lendemain se marier à Londres ; elle le connaissait bien, elle l’avait eu. Et cette histoire fit le tour des dames ; seulement, Maria Blond prétendait, de son côté, reconnaître un ambassadeur allemand, à preuve qu’il couchait souvent avec une de ses amies. Parmi les hommes, en phrases rapides, on le jugeait. Une tête de monsieur sérieux. Peut-être qu’il payait le souper. Probable. Ça sentait ça. Bah ! pourvu que le souper fût bon ! Enfin, on resta dans le doute, on oubliait déjà le vieillard à barbe blanche, lorsque le maître d’hôtel ouvrit la porte du grand salon.","She looked around. But she became serious, as if surprised not to find anyone there. Doubtless there was missing a guest of whom she did not speak. We had to wait. A few minutes later, the guests saw in their midst a tall gentleman, with a noble face and a handsome white beard. And the most surprising thing was that no one had seen him enter; he must have slipped into the small drawing-room through a bedroom door which had remained ajar. A silence reigned, whispers ran. The Comte de Vandeuvres certainly knew who the gentleman was, for they had both exchanged a discreet handshake; but he answered the women's questions with a smile. Then Caroline Héquet, in a low voice, bet for an English lord, who was returning the next day to be married in London; she knew him well, she had had him. And this story made the rounds of the ladies; only Maria Blond claimed, for her part, to recognize a German ambassador, as proof that he often slept with one of her friends. Among the men, in quick phrases, he was judged. A face of a serious gentleman. Maybe he was paying for dinner. Likely. It felt like that. Bah ! provided the supper was good! Finally, we were left in doubt, we had already forgotten the old man with the white beard, when the butler opened the door of the large drawing-room.","She looked about her. But she suddenly became serious, as though surprised at not seeing some one there. There was doubtless still one guest missing, of whom she had not spoken. They must wait. A few minutes later they noticed in their midst a tall gentleman with a noble-looking countenance and a handsome white beard. And the strange thing was that no one had seen him enter the room; he must have got into the parlour from the bedroom by a door that was left ajar. Only some whispering broke the silence. Count de Vandeuvres evidently knew the gentleman, for they had very discreetly shaken each other by the hand, but he only answered the women’s questions with a smile. Then Caroline Héquet, in a low voice, bet he was an English nobleman who was returning to London on the morrow to be married; she knew him well, in fact only too well. This story went the round of the ladies, only Maria Blond pretended, on her side, that he was a German ambassador, and to prove it said that he was most intimately acquainted with one of her lady friends. The men, in a few words, rapidly judged him. He looked like a person of means. Perhaps he stood the supper. It was probable. It appeared like it. Well! what did it matter so long as the supper was good? At all events, every one remained in doubt; they were already forgetting the presence of the old gentleman with the white beard, when the head-waiter opened the drawing-room door.","She looked round her but grew suddenly serious, as though she were surprised at not finding someone. Doubtless there was a guest missing whom she did not mention. It was a case of waiting. But a minute or two later the company noticed in their midst a tall gentleman with a fine face and a beautiful white beard. The most astonishing thing about it was that nobody had seen him come in; indeed, he must have slipped into the little drawing room through the bedroom door, which had remained ajar. Silence reigned, broken only by a sound of whispering. The Count de Vandeuvres certainly knew who the gentleman was, for they both exchanged a discreet handgrip, but to the questions which the women asked him he replied by a smile only. Thereupon Caroline Hequet wagered in a low voice that it was an English lord who was on the eve of returning to London to be married. She knew him quite well--she had had him. And this account of the matter went the round of the ladies present, Maria Blond alone asserting that, for her part, she recognized a German ambassador. She could prove it, because he often passed the night with one of her friends. Among the men his measure was taken in a few rapid phrases. A real swell, to judge by his looks! Perhaps he would pay for the supper! Most likely. It looked like it. Bah! Provided only the supper was a good one! In the end the company remained undecided. Nay, they were already beginning to forget the old white-bearded gentleman when the manager opened the door of the large drawing room.","She was running her eyes round the room. Suddenly she looked earnest, as though surprised not to see someone. No doubt there was a guest missing whom she was not going to mention. They’d have to wait. A few minutes later, the guests noticed in their midst a tall, very distinguished-looking man with a superb white beard. And the most astonishing thing was that nobody had seen him come in; he must have slipped into the small drawing-room through a bedroom door which had been left half-open. There was silence, people were whispering among themselves. Count de Vandeuvres certainly knew who the gentleman was, for they had discreetly shaken hands; but when questioned by some of the ladies, he merely smiled. In a stage whisper, Caroline bet that he was an English lord who was returning home the following day to get married in London; she knew him; she’d had him. The story circulated amongst the ladies, but Maria Blond claimed to recognize a German ambassador; she knew this because he often went to bed with one of her friends. The men were doing a rapid assessment: looked a man of substance; could be paying for the supper—this was probable; you had the feeling he might be … And what the hell! As long as it was a good supper! In the end people were still uncertain, but they were already forgetting the white-bearded old gentleman when the head waiter flung open the door of the large drawing-room:"

"C'était une de ces fêtes de printemps, d’un charme si tendre. Les chaudes soirées de juin avaient permis d’ouvrir les deux portes du grand salon et de prolonger le bal jusque dans le sable du jardin. Quand les premiers invités arrivèrent, accueillis à la porte par le comte et la comtesse, ils eurent un éblouissement. Il fallait se rappeler le salon d’autrefois, où passait le souvenir glacial de la comtesse Muffat, cette pièce antique, toute pleine d’une sévérité dévote, avec son meuble 7 Empire d’acajou massif, ses tentures de velours jaune, son plafond verdâtre, trempé d’humidité. Maintenant, dès l’entrée, dans le vestibule, des mosaïques rehaussées d’or se moiraient 8 sous de hauts candélabres, tandis que l’escalier de marbre déroulait sa rampe aux fines ciselures. Puis, le salon resplendissait, drapé de velours de Gênes, tendu au plafond d’une vaste décoration de Boucher9, que l’architecte avait payée cent mille francs, à la vente du château de Dampierre. Les lustres, les appliques de cristal allumaient là un luxe de glaces et de meubles précieux. On eût dit que la chaise longue de Sabine, ce siège unique de soie rouge, dont la mollesse autrefois détonnait, s’était multipliée, élargie, jusqu’à emplir l’hôtel entier d’une voluptueuse paresse, d’une jouissance aiguë, qui brûlait avec la violence des feux tardifs.","It was one of those spring festivals, so tenderly charming. The warm June evenings had made it possible to open the two doors of the large living room and prolong the ball into the sand of the garden. When the first guests arrived, greeted at the door by the Count and Countess, they were dazzled. You had to remember the drawing-room of yesteryear, through which passed the icy memory of the Countess Muffat, that antique room, full of devout severity, with its solid mahogany 7th Empire furniture, its yellow velvet hangings, its ceiling greenish, soaked with moisture. Now, as soon as you enter, in the vestibule, mosaics enhanced with gold shimmer under high candelabra, while the marble staircase unrolls its finely carved banister. Then the salon was resplendent, draped in Genoese velvet, hung from the ceiling with a vast decoration by Boucher,9 for which the architect had paid a hundred thousand francs at the sale of the Château de Dampierre. Chandeliers and crystal sconces lit up a luxury of mirrors and precious furniture. One would have said that Sabine's chaise longue, that single seat of red silk, whose softness once seemed out of place, had multiplied, widened, until it filled the entire hotel with a voluptuous laziness, an acute enjoyment, which burned with the violence of late fires.","It was one of those charming spring parties. The warm June evening had enabled the two doors of the drawing-room to be thrown wide open, and the ball to be carried even on the gravel paths of the garden. When the first guests arrived they were fairly dazzled, as the count and countess greeted them at the door. It was difficult to recall the room of bygone days in which lingered the icy recollection of old Countess Muffat—that antique apartment, full of devout severity, with its solid mahogany furniture in the style of the Empire, its yellow velvet hangings, its greenish ceiling saturated with dampness. Now, in the entrance vestibule, mosaics set off with gold shone beneath the tall candelabra; whilst the marble staircase unrolled its finely-chiselled balustrade. Then the drawing-room was resplendent with Genoa velvet hangings, and a ceiling embellished with a vast painting by Boucher,bc which the architect had purchased for one hundred thousand francs at the sale of the château of Dampierre. The crystal chandeliers and candelabra illuminated a profusion of mirrors and costly furniture. One could have said that Sabine’s easy-chair—that solitary seat covered with crimson silk, and the softness of which used to seem so much out of place—had extended and multiplied until it filled the entire house with a voluptous indolence, a keen enjoyment, which burned with all the intensity of latent fires.","It was one of those spring festivities which have a delicate charm of their own. Owing to the warmth of the June nights, it had become possible to open the two doors of the great drawing room and to extend the dancing floor to the sanded paths of the garden. When the first guests arrived and were welcomed at the door by the count and the countess they were positively dazzled. One had only to recall to mind the drawing room of the past, through which flitted the icy, ghostly presence of the Countess Muffat, that antique room full of an atmosphere of religious austerity with its massive First Empire mahogany furniture, its yellow velvet hangings, its moldy ceiling through which the damp had soaked. Now from the very threshold of the entrance hall mosaics set off with gold were glittering under the lights of lofty candelabras, while the marble staircase unfurled, as it were, a delicately chiseled balustrade. Then, too, the drawing room looked splendid; it was hung with Genoa velvet, and a huge decorative design by Boucher covered the ceiling, a design for which the architect had paid a hundred thousand francs at the sale of the Chateau de Dampierre. The lusters and the crystal ornaments lit up a luxurious display of mirrors and precious furniture. It seemed as though Sabine's long chair, that solitary red silk chair, whose soft contours were so marked in the old days, had grown and spread till it filled the whole great house with voluptuous idleness and a sense of tense enjoyment not less fierce and hot than a fire which has been long in burning up.","The party took place in a setting full of gentle, spring-like charm; mild June weather had made it possible to open up the double doors of the large drawing-room and to extend the dancing out on to the sandy garden terrace. The first guests, greeted at the door by the count and countess, were quite dazzled; they could remember the icy old Countess Muffat and the old-fashioned drawing-room full of stern piety and solid mahogany Empire furniture, with its yellow velvet hangings and its damp, musty, green ceiling. Now on entering the front hall you saw glittering mosaics picked out in gold, with the marble staircase and its delicately carved banisters gleaming under the high candelabra. The hall led into the magnificent drawing-room draped in Genoese velvet with an immense decorative ceiling by Boucher* for which the architect had paid one hundred thousand francs at the sale of the Château de Dampierre. In this room the chandeliers and crystal sconces lit up a luxurious array of mirrors and fine furniture; Sabine’s former single chaise longue, with its red silk upholstery which had looked so much out of place in the old days, seemed now to have spawned and expanded, filling the whole grand residence with a mood of idle pleasure and eager enjoyment which had broken out with the violence of a fire that had long been smouldering."
"Oui, au fait, elle s’était envolée en quittant la table. On se souvenait d’elle, tout le monde la réclamait. Steiner, inquiet depuis un instant, questionna Vandeuvres au sujet du vieux monsieur, disparu lui aussi. Mais le comte le rassura, il venait de reconduire le vieillard ; un personnage étranger dont il était inutile de dire le nom, un homme très riche qui se contentait de payer les soupers. Puis, comme on oubliait de nouveau Nana, Vandeuvres aperçut Daguenet, la tête à une porte, l’appelant d’un signe. Et, dans la chambre à coucher, il trouva la maîtresse de la maison assise, raidie, les lèvres blanches, tandis que Daguenet et Georges, debout, la regardaient d’un air consterné.","Yes, by the way, she had flown away leaving the table. We remembered her, everyone asked for her. Steiner, worried for a moment, questioned Vandeuvres about the old gentleman, who had also disappeared. But the count reassured him, he had just escorted the old man; a foreign character whose name it was useless to say, a very rich man who contented himself with paying for the suppers. Then, as they forgot Nana again, Vandeuvres saw Daguenet, his head at a door, beckoning him. And, in the bedroom, he found the mistress of the house seated, rigid, with white lips, while Daguenet and Georges, standing, looked at her with an air of consternation.","Yes, as a matter of fact, she had disappeared on leaving the supper table. They now began to think of her; every one made inquiries. Steiner suddenly became most anxious, questioned Vandeuvres with respect to the old gentleman, who had also disappeared; but the count calmed his fears. He had just seen the old gentleman off. He was a distinguished foreigner, whose name it was unnecessary to mention. He was very rich, and was satisfied with paying for the suppers. Then, every one again forgetting Nana, Vandeuvres noticed Daguenet’s head at the door, signalling to him to come; and in the bedroom, he found the mistress of the house seated quite rigid, with her lips all white, whilst Daguenet and George were standing watching her with looks of consternation.","Yes, she had certainly flown away somewhere on leaving the table. The company suddenly recollected her, and everybody asked for her. Steiner, who for some seconds had been uneasy on her account, asked Vandeuvres about the old gentleman, for he, too, had disappeared. But the count reassured him--he had just brought the old gentleman back. He was a stranger, whose name it was useless to mention. Suffice it to say that he was a very rich man who was quite pleased to pay for suppers! Then as Nana was once more being forgotten, Vandeuvres saw Daguenet looking out of an open door and beckoning to him. And in the bedroom he found the mistress of the house sitting up, white-lipped and rigid, while Daguenet and Georges stood gazing at her with an alarmed expression.","Where indeed? She’d slipped away immediately on leaving the table. People were becoming aware of her absence and calling out for her. Steiner was growing uneasy and questioned Vandeuvres about the old gentleman, who’d also disappeared. The count reassured him: a foreign VIP, no point in mentioning names, rolling in money and only too happy just subsidizing supper parties. Then, as people were again starting to forget Nana, Vandeuvres caught sight of Daguenet poking his head through a doorway and making signs to him. Vandeuvres went in and saw Nana, tense and pale, sitting on her bed. Daguenet and Georges were standing watching her in consternation."

"Muffat restait saisi, glacé par ce drame, la pensée pleine de cette mère pleurant ses fils. Il connaissait son grand cœur, il la voyait, dans ses habits de veuve, s’éteignant seule aux Fondettes. Mais Nana se désespérait plus fort. Maintenant, l’image de Zizi, tombé par terre, avec un trou rouge sur sa chemise, la jetait hors d’elle.","Muffat remained gripped, frozen by this drama, his thoughts full of this mother weeping for her sons. He knew her great heart, he saw her, in her widow's clothes, dying alone at Fondettes. But Nana was more desperate. Now the image of Zizi, fallen on the ground, with a red hole on his shirt, threw her out of her mind.","Muffat was greatly affected, feeling stunned by the drama, his thoughts full of that mother weeping for her two children. He knew her great heart; he saw her in her widow’s weeds, pining away all alone at Les Fondettes. But Nana’s despair increased.

He knew her greatness of heart and pictured her in her widow's weeds, withering solitarily away at Les Fondettes. But Nana grew ever more despondent, for now the memory of Zizi lying stretched on the floor, with a red hole in his shirt, almost drove her senseless.","Muffat was in a daze, stunned by the drama, thinking all the time of this mother who must be mourning her son. He knew how upright she was and could see her in her widow’s weeds slowly sinking into her grave at Les Fondettes.

"Pourtant, elle prit son air de princesse, comme elle disait.

"Toutes les portes demeuraient ouvertes, dans la débandade bruyante des domestiques, qui avaient vu madame sortir à pied. En bas, sur la banquette du vestibule, le boulanger riait avec Charles et François. Comme Zoé traversait le salon en courant, elle parut surprise de voir Georges et lui demanda s’il attendait madame. Oui, il l’attendait, il avait oublié de lui rendre une réponse. Et, quand il fut seul, il se mit à chercher. Ne trouvant rien autre, il prit dans le cabinet de toilette une paire de ciseaux très pointus, dont Nana avait la continuelle manie de se servir pour éplucher sa personne, se rognant des peaux, se coupant des poils. Alors, pendant une heure, il patienta, les doigts collés nerveusement aux ciseaux, la main dans sa poche.","All the doors remained open, in the noisy rout of the servants, who had seen Madame go out on foot. Downstairs, on the bench in the vestibule, the baker was laughing with Charles and Francois.

And, when he was alone, he began to search. Finding nothing else, he took a pair of very sharp scissors from the dressing room, which Nana had the continual habit of using to peel her person, trimming her skin, cutting her hair. So, for an hour, he waited, his fingers glued nervously to the scissors, his hand in his pocket.","All the doors were left open as the servants noisily scuttled about, they having seen madame go out on foot.

Yet one thing struck her: Labordette had given her exactly the same advice as Francis. That evening, when Fontan returned home she questioned him about Fauchery’s piece. He had been back at the Variety Theatre for two months past. Why had he not told her about the part?","And she left him. Her heroic conduct made her tenderly pitiful toward herself. No blackguard of a man would ever have sacrificed himself like that without trumpeting the fact abroad. Nevertheless, she was struck by one thing: Labordette had given her exactly the same advice as Francis had given her. That evening when Fontan came home she questioned him about Fauchery's piece. The former had been back at the Varietes for two months past. Why then had he not told her about the part?","she retorted vigorously. And she went on her way, filled with self-pity for her heroic conduct. No male bastard would have sacrificed himself like that without proclaiming it from the house-tops. But one thing did strike her: Labordette had just given her the same advice as Francis. When Fontan came home that night, she questioned him about Fauchery’s play. He himself had gone back to acting at the Variétés two months ago. Why hadn’t he told her about that part?"
"Puis, le petit revenant toujours sur son frère, elle finit par s’occuper de Philippe. Au bout d’une semaine, elle le connut des pieds à la tête, très grand, très fort, gai, un peu brutal ; et, avec ça, des détails intimes, des poils sur les bras, un signe à l’épaule. Si bien qu’un jour, toute pleine de l’image de cet homme qu’elle devait faire jeter à la porte, elle s’écria :","Then, the little one always coming back to his brother, she ends up taking care of Philippe. At the end of a week, she knew him from head to foot, very tall, very strong, gay, a little rough; and, with that, intimate details, hair on the arms, a sign on the shoulder. So much so that one day, full of the image of this man whom she was to have thrown out, she exclaimed:","Then, the youngster constantly alluding to his brother, she ended by thinking a little of Philippe. When a week had gone by, she knew him from the hair of his head to the tips of his toes—very tall, very strong, lively and rather rough; and with all that, some more minute details, certain hairs on his arm, a mole on his shoulder. So that one day, full of the image of this man, whom she was to send off a little quicker than he came, she exclaimed,","Soon, as the lad kept returning to the subject of his brother, she ended by taking a certain interest in Philippe, and in a week's time she knew him from head to foot--knew him as very tall and very strong and merry and somewhat rough. She learned intimate details, too, and found out that he had hair on his arms and a birthmark on his shoulder. So thoroughly did she learn her lesson that one day, when she was full of the image of the man who was to be turned out of doors by her orders, she cried out:","Then, as the boy kept coming back to the subject of his brother, she began to pay closer attention. By the end of a week, she knew everything about him: he was very tall and strong, lively, rather outspoken; and a few more personal details as well: hairy arms, a birthmark on his shoulder. As a result, she became so intrigued by the image of this man whom she was going to have kicked out of her house that one day she exclaimed:"
"— Très bien, merci. »",- Very well thank you. »,"“I’m very well, thanks.”","""Very well, thank you.""","‘I’m very well, thank you.’"

In spite of his being a lieutenant, François will very quickly send him to the right about! ”","""Gracious me, I should like to see him come! For all that he's a lieutenant in the army, Francois will chuck him out in double-quick time!""","‘I’d like to see him try! He may be a lieutenant but François will kick him out for you double-quick, don’t worry!’"
"« Ah ! ce pauvre Louiset ! dit Nana. Es-tu beaucoup mouillé, mon chéri ? »","“Oh! poor Louiset! Nana said. Are you very wet, my darling? »","“Oh! poor little Louis!” said Nana. “Are you very wet, my cherub?”","""Oh, that poor, dear Louiset!"" said Nana. ""Are you very drenched, my darling?""","‘Oh, poor little Louis!’ said Nana. ‘Are you soaked, my precious?’"
"Nana resta étranglée. Mais pourquoi tout ça ? l’autre avait volé, à présent ! ils étaient donc fous, dans cette famille ! Elle ne se débattait plus, n’ayant pas l’air chez elle, laissant madame Hugon donner des ordres. Des domestiques avaient fini par accourir, la vieille dame voulut absolument qu’ils descendissent Georges évanoui dans sa voiture. Elle aimait mieux le tuer et l’emporter de cette maison. Nana, de ses regards stupéfaits, suivit les domestiques qui tenaient ce pauvre Zizi par les épaules et par les jambes. La mère marchait derrière, épuisée maintenant, s’appuyant aux meubles, comme jetée au néant de tout ce qu’elle aimait. Sur le palier, elle eut un sanglot, elle se retourna et dit à deux reprises :","Nana remained strangled. But why all this? the other had flown now! they were therefore mad, in this family! She was no longer struggling, not seeming at home, leaving Madame Hugon to give orders. Servants had finally come running, the old lady absolutely wanted them to lower the fainted Georges into his car. She preferred to kill him and carry him away from this house. Nana, with her stupefied looks, followed the servants who were holding poor Zizi by the shoulders and by the legs. The mother walked behind, exhausted now, leaning on the furniture, as though thrown into nothingness by all she loved. On the landing she sobbed, turned around and said twice:","Nana remained transfixed, gasping for breath. But why all that? The other had robbed—they were mad then, in that family! She ceased struggling, no longer seeming to be in her own house, but leaving Madame Hugon to give her own orders. Some of the servants had at last hastened to the spot; the old lady insisted on having George, insensible as he was, taken to her carriage. She would remove him from that house, though it killed him. Nana, with a stupefied gaze, watched the servants carrying that poor Zizi by his legs and shoulders. The mother followed behind, quite exhausted now, leaning on the furniture, as though sunk into the nothingness of all she loved. On the landing she sighed and turning round, said twice,","Nana felt a choking sensation. Why, what was the reason of it all? The other had turned thief now! They were mad in that family! She ceased struggling in self-defense; she seemed no longer mistress in her own house and allowed Mme Hugon to give what orders she liked. The servants had at last hurried up, and the old lady insisted on their carrying the fainting Georges down to her carriage. She preferred killing him rather than letting him remain in that house. With an air of stupefaction Nana watched the retreating servants as they supported poor, dear Zizi by his legs and shoulders. The mother walked behind them in a state of collapse; she supported herself against the furniture; she felt as if all she held dear had vanished in the void. On the landing a sob escaped her; she turned and twice ejaculated:","Words stuck in Nana’s throat. Where was the reason for all this? Now the other man had been stealing! Was the whole family crazy? She felt unable to cope any more. Feeling a stranger in her own house, she let Madame Hugon issue her instructions. The servants had appeared; the old lady insisted on Georges’s being carried down, unconscious, to her carriage. She wanted to get him out of this house even at the risk of killing him. Nana watched in a stupor as the servants lifted poor little Zizi up by his legs and shoulders and carried him away, followed by his mother, now exhausted, clutching at the furniture for support, crushed by the loss of everything she held dear. On the landing, she turned and sobbed:"
"Mais, dans son désir de le renvoyer, sautant à une autre humeur, elle fut brutale, ne ménageant plus les mots.","But, in her desire to send him away, jumping to another mood, she was brutal, sparing no words.","But in her desire to send him off, her humour quickly changed. She was coarse, and no longer minced her words.","But in her desire to be rid of him she suddenly changed her mood, became brutal and did not take care what she was saying.","But she was now keen to get him out of the house; her mood changed and she started to speak bluntly, not bothering to spare his feelings."
"Des pudeurs lui venaient. Elle était toute rouge. Personne ne pouvait la voir, pourtant ; la chambre s’emplissait de nuit derrière eux, tandis que la campagne déroulait le silence et l’immobilité de sa solitude. Jamais elle n’avait eu une pareille honte. Peu à peu, elle se sentait sans force, malgré sa gêne et ses révoltes. Ce déguisement, cette chemise de femme et ce peignoir, la faisaient rire encore. C'était comme une amie qui la taquinait.","Modesty came to him. She was all red. No one could see her, though; the room filled with night behind them, while the countryside unrolled the silence and the immobility of its solitude. Never had she felt such shame. Little by little, she felt herself without strength, despite her embarrassment and her revolts. This disguise, this woman's shirt and this peignoir, still made her laugh. It was like a friend teasing her.","She had become quite bashful; her face was flushing scarlet. Yet no one could see her. The room behind them was full of the darkness of night, whilst as far as the eye could reach the countryside unfolded the silence and immobility of its solitude. Never before had she felt such shame. Little by little her strength seemed to leave her in spite of her constraint and her struggles. That disguise, that woman’s night-dress and that dressing-gown, made her laugh still. It was like a girl friend teasing her.","A sudden feeling of shame overcame her. She was blushing exceedingly, and yet not a soul could see her. The room behind them was full of black night while the country stretched before them in silence and lifeless solitude. Never had she known such a sense of shame before. Little by little she felt her power of resistance ebbing away, and that despite her embarrassed efforts to the contrary. That disguise of his, that woman's shift and that dressing jacket set her laughing again. It was as though a girl friend were teasing her.","She was blushing with embarrassment and modesty. Yet no one could see her; behind her the night was flooding into the bedroom while outside the deserted countryside was full of stillness and silence. Never before had she felt bashful like this. Little by little, in spite of her embarrassment and reluctance, she was beginning to weaken. She was still finding the disguise, the dressing-gown and woman’s night-gown, rather funny. It was as if she was being pestered by a girlfriend."

"Le comte avait eu un geste pour l’arrêter. Fauchery n’entendait pas. Poussé contre le manteau d'arlequin40 par Fontan, il devait subir les explications sur la façon dont le comédien comprenait Tardiveau. Fontan voyait Tardiveau en Marseillais, avec de l’accent ; et il imitait l’accent. Des répliques entières y passaient ; était-ce bien ainsi ? Il ne semblait que soumettre des idées, dont il doutait lui-même. Mais Fauchery se montrant froid et faisant des objections, il se vexa tout de suite. Très bien ! Du moment où l’esprit du rôle lui échappait, il vaudrait mieux pour tout le monde qu’il ne le jouât pas.","The Count had made a gesture to stop him. Fauchery did not hear. Pushed against the harlequin coat40 by Fontan, he had to submit to explanations about how the actor understood Tardiveau. Fontan saw Tardiveau as a Marseillais, with an accent; and he imitated the accent. Entire lines played there; was it good like that? He only seemed to submit ideas, which he himself doubted. But Fauchery being cold and making objections, he was offended right away. Very well ! As soon as the spirit of the part escaped him, it would be better for everyone if he did not play it.","The count made a slight gesture to stop him. Fauchery did not hear. Fontan had got him up against the proscenium wall, and was giving him his ideas of the part of Tardiveau. The actor thought he should make up as a Marseillais, with the southern accent, which he kept imitating. He made whole speeches that way; was that the proper rendering of the part? He seemed only to be giving his own ideas, and which he himself had doubts about. But Fauchery, keeping very cool in the matter, and offering numerous objections, Fontan became annoyed at once. Very well! As the correct reading of the part had entirely escaped him, it would be far better for every one that he should not play it.","The count had been on the point of stopping him. But Fauchery did not hear him, for he had been pinned against the curtain by Fontan and was being compelled to listen patiently to the comedian's reading of the part of Tardiveau. Fontan imagined Tardiveau to be a native of Marseilles with a dialect, and he imitated the dialect. He was repeating whole speeches. Was that right? Was this the thing? Apparently he was only submitting ideas to Fauchery of which he was himself uncertain, but as the author seemed cold and raised various objections, he grew angry at once. Oh, very well, the moment the spirit of the part escaped him it would be better for all concerned that he shouldn't act it at all!","The count made a move to stop him; Fauchery hadn’t heard. Cornered against the proscenium arch by Fontan, he was having to submit to an analysis of how the actor conceived his role as Tardiveau. Fontan saw him as a man from Marseilles, complete with the accent, which he imitated. He was spouting line after line: was that how it ought to go? He seemed to be merely putting forward ideas which he wasn’t certain about himself; but when Fauchery looked unimpressed and started raising objections, he at once took offence. All right, then, if his idea of the part was wrong, it’d be better for all concerned if he didn’t take it."

"C'était une députation de mortels que Ganymède et Iris avaient introduite, des bourgeois respectables, tous maris trompés et venant présenter au maître des dieux une plainte contre Vénus, qui enflammait vraiment leurs femmes de trop d'ardeurs50. Le chœur, sur un ton dolent et naïf, coupé de silences pleins d’aveux, amusa beaucoup. Un mot fit le tour de la salle : « Le chœur des cocus, le chœurs des cocus » ; et le mot devait rester, on cria « bis ». Les têtes des choristes étaient drôles, on leur trouvait une figure à ça, un gros surtout, la face ronde comme une lune. Cependant, Vulcain arrivait, furieux, demandant sa femme, filée depuis trois jours. Le chœur reprenait, implorant Vulcain, le dieu des cocus. Ce personnage de Vulcain était joué par Fontan, un comique d’un talent canaille et original, qui avait un déhanchement d’une fantaisie folle, en forgeron de village, la perruque flambante, les bras nus, tatoués de cœurs percés de flèches. Une voix de femme laissa échapper, très haut : « Ah ! qu’il est laid ! » ; et toutes riaient en applaudissant.","It was a deputation of mortals that Ganymede and Iris had introduced, respectable bourgeois, all deceived husbands and coming to present to the master of the gods a complaint against Venus, who really inflamed their women with too much ardor. The choir, in a doleful and naive tone, interrupted by silences full of confessions, amused a lot. A word made the rounds of the room: ""The choir of cuckolds, the choir of cuckolds""; and the word had to stay, we shouted ""bis"". The heads of the choristers were funny, we found a face in them, especially a big one, the face round like a moon. However, Vulcan arrived, furious, asking for his wife, who had been shadowed for three days. The chorus resumed, imploring Vulcan, the god of cuckolds. This Vulcan character was played by Fontan, a comedian of raunchy and original talent, who swung his hips wildly, like a village blacksmith, his wig flaming, his arms bare, tattooed with hearts pierced with arrows. A woman's voice let out, very loudly: “Ah! how ugly he is! » ; and they all laughed and applauded.","It was a deputation of mortals introduced by Ganymede and Iris, respectable citizens, all deceived husbands, come to lay before Jupiter a complaint against Venus, who inspired their wives with a great deal too much ardour. The chorus, which they sang in a simple and doleful manner, was now and again interrupted by the most significant pauses, and amused the audience immensely. A whisper went round the house: “The cuckolds’ chorus, the cuckolds’ chorus;” the name stuck to it, and it was encored. The get-up of the singers was very comic, their faces were in accordance with the part they played; there was one especially, a stout fellow with a face as round as a moon. Vulcan, however, appeared on the scene in a state of furious indignation, seeking his wife, who had disappeared from home three days before. The chorus struck up again, imploring Vulcan, the god of cuckolds, to help them. The part of Vulcan was played by Fontan, a comic actor gifted with a talent as spicy as it was original, who waddled about in the most ludicrous manner imaginable, in the costume of a village blacksmith, with a flaring red wig on his head, and his arms bare and tattooed all over with hearts pierced by arrows. A woman’s voice exclaimed aloud, “Oh! isn’t he ugly!” and every one laughed as they applauded.","It was a deputation of mortals whom Ganymede and Iris had introduced, respectable middle-class persons, deceived husbands, all of them, and they came before the master of the gods to proffer a complaint against Venus, who was assuredly inflaming their good ladies with an excess of ardor. The chorus, in quaint, dolorous tones, broken by silences full of pantomimic admissions, caused great amusement. A neat phrase went the round of the house: ""The cuckolds' chorus, the cuckolds' chorus,"" and it ""caught on,"" for there was an encore. The singers' heads were droll; their faces were discovered to be in keeping with the phrase, especially that of a fat man which was as round as the moon. Meanwhile Vulcan arrived in a towering rage, demanding back his wife who had slipped away three days ago. The chorus resumed their plaint, calling on Vulcan, the god of the cuckolds. Vulcan's part was played by Fontan, a comic actor of talent, at once vulgar and original, and he had a role of the wildest whimsicality and was got up as a village blacksmith, fiery red wig , bare arms tattooed with arrow-pierced hearts and all the rest of it. A woman's voice cried in a very high key, ""Oh, isn't he ugly?"" and all the ladies laughed and applauded.","But it was a deputation of mortals introduced by Ganymede and Iris, respectable middle-class citizens, all deceived husbands coming to lay a complaint with the master of the gods against Venus, who was making their wives far too passionate. This chorus, sung in a mournful, simple tone, full of hidden admissions, aroused great amusement. Some wit made a comment which ran round the theatre—‘the cuckolds’ chorus’, and the remark stuck. People started shouting ‘Encore!’ The chorus had funny faces and really looked the part, particularly one fat, moon-faced man. Meanwhile Vulcan came in, furiously demanding to see his wife who hadn’t been home for the last three days. The chorus took up their refrain again, appealing to Vulcan, the King of the Cuckolds. This character was played by Fontan, a vulgar comedian, very clever and original, who lurched around crazily like a village blacksmith, in a flaming red wig and with bare arms tattooed with hearts pierced by arrows. In the audience a female voice blurted out, very loudly, ‘What a hideous man!’ and the women all started laughing and clapping."

"Dans l’angoisse de sa jalousie, le malheureux en arrivait à être tranquille, lorsqu’il laissait Nana et Satin ensemble. Il l’aurait poussée à ce vice, pour écarter les hommes. Mais, de ce côté encore, tout se gâtait. Nana trompait Satin comme elle trompait le comte, s’enrageant dans des toquades monstrueuses, ramassant des filles au coin des bornes. Quand elle rentrait en voiture, elle s’amourachait parfois d’un souillon aperçu sur le pavé, les sens pris, l’imagination lâchée ; et elle faisait monter le souillon, le payait et le renvoyait. Puis, sous un déguisement d’homme, c’étaient des parties dans des maisons infâmes, des spectacles de débauche dont elle amusait son ennui. Et Satin, irritée d’être lâchée continuellement, bouleversait l’hôtel de scènes atroces ; elle avait fini par prendre un empire absolu sur Nana, qui la respectait. Muffat rêva même une alliance. Quand il n’osait pas, il déchaînait Satin. Deux fois, elle avait forcé sa chérie à le reprendre ; tandis que lui se montrait obligeant, l’avertissait et s’effaçait devant elle, au moindre signe. Seulement, l’entente ne durait guère, Satin était fêlée, elle aussi. Certains jours, elle cassait tout, crevée à moitié, s’abîmant à des rages de colère et de tendresse, jolie quand même. Zoé devait lui monter la tête, car elle la prenait dans les coins, comme si elle avait voulu l’embaucher pour sa grande affaire, ce plan dont elle ne parlait encore à personne.","In the anguish of his jealousy, the unfortunate man came to be at peace when he left Nana and Satin together. He would have pushed her to this vice, to keep men away. But, on this side again, everything was going badly. Nana deceived Satin as she deceived the Count, becoming enraged in monstrous fits of passion, picking up girls at the corners of the boundary stones. When she drove home, she sometimes fell in love with a slob seen on the pavement, his senses caught, his imagination unleashed; and she made the slut come upstairs, paid him and sent him away. Then, disguised as a man, there were parties in infamous houses, shows of debauchery with which she amused her boredom. And Satin, irritated at being continually let loose, upset the hotel with atrocious scenes; she had ended up taking absolute sway over Nana, who respected her. Muffat even dreamed of an alliance. When he didn't dare, he unleashed Satin. Twice she had forced her darling to take him back; while he was obliging, warning her and stepping aside before her, at the slightest sign. Only, the agreement did not last long, Satin was cracked, too. Some days, she broke everything, half shattered, sinking into rages of anger and tenderness, pretty all the same. Zoe must have gotten on her, because she took her around, as if she wanted to hire her for her big business, this plan she still didn't tell anyone about.","In the agony of his jealousy, the unhappy man had reached the state of feeling easy whenever he left Nana and Satin alone together. He would have encouraged her in this connection for the sake of keeping the men away. But on this side also everything went wrong. Nana deceived Satin, the same as she deceived the count, having a rage for the most monstrous crazes, picking up girls from the street corners. When returning home in her carriage, she would at times become enamoured of some strumpet caught sight of on the pavement, her senses inflamed, her imagination kindled; and she would take the woman with her, then pay her and send her away. At other times, disguised as a man, she would frequent houses of ill repute, and witness spectacles of debauchery, which helped her to forget her weariness; and Satin, annoyed at being continually forsaken, would disturb the house with the most atrocious scenes. She had ended by gaining complete mastery over Nana, who respected her. Muffat even thought of allying himself with her. When he did not dare to do anything himself, he would set Satin to work. Twice she had made her darling take him back; whilst he showed himself very obliging, giving her a word of warning or making himself scarce at the least sign. Only the understanding did not last long; for Satin too was cracked. On certain days she would smash everything, feeling half dead, ruining what little health she had left in excesses of anger or of dissipation, looking pretty though, in spite of all. Zoé probably set her off; for she took her into corners, as though she wished to gain her over in the interests of that grand business of hers, that plan of which she had never yet spoken to anyone.","In his jealous anguish the unhappy man was comparatively at peace when he left Nana and Satin alone together. He would have willingly urged her on to this vice, to keep the men off her. But all was spoiled in this direction too. Nana deceived Satin as she deceived the count, going mad over some monstrous fancy or other and picking up girls at the street corners. Coming back in her carriage, she would suddenly be taken with a little slut that she saw on the pavement; her senses would be captivated, her imagination excited. She would take the little slut in with her, pay her and send her away again. Then, disguised as a man, she would go to infamous houses and look on at scenes of debauch to while away hours of boredom. And Satin, angry at being thrown over every moment, would turn the house topsy-turvy with the most awful scenes. She had at last acquired a complete ascendancy over Nana, who now respected her. Muffat even thought of an alliance between them. When he dared not say anything he let Satin loose. Twice she had compelled her darling to take up with him again, while he showed himself obliging and effaced himself in her favor at the least sign. But this good understanding lasted no time, for Satin, too, was a little cracked. On certain days she would very nearly go mad and would smash everything, wearing herself out in tempest of love and anger, but pretty all the time. Zoe must have excited her, for the maid took her into corners as if she wanted to tell her about her great design of which she as yet spoke to no one.","The wretched man had been reduced to such agonies of jealousy that he felt positively relieved when Nana was with Satin. He’d have encouraged Nana in this vice if only to keep men away. But in this department, too, things were going wrong: Nana was being as unfaithful to Satin as she was to the count, hurling herself enthusiastically into wild passing affairs. She’d pick tarts up from the street; driving home, she’d take a fancy to some slut walking along in the road; she’d feel randy, her imagination would take over, she’d invite the little slut up to her room, pay her, and send her away. She would disguise herself as a man and have orgies in brothels; watching people doing it helped relieve her boredom. Annoyed at being continually deserted, Satin was constantly turning the house upside-down with dreadful scenes; she’d at last succeeded in completely dominating Nana, who respected her. Muffat even had hopes of making an ally of her; when he was too intimidated he’d get her to tackle Nana on his behalf, and she’d already forced her darling Nana to take him back a couple of times. In return he did things to help her, giving friendly warnings and retreating into the background at the slightest hint from her. However, their pact didn’t really last very long: Satin was equally crazy. Some days she’d go completely berserk in uncontrollable fits of rage or love which left her half-dead, but still looking pretty. Zoé must have been egging her on, because she’d have quiet chats with her in out-of-the-way corners, as if she was looking forward to recruiting her for her grand design which she hadn’t yet divulged to anyone."

"La grosse difficulté fut de trouver de la monnaie. Il n’y avait pas dix francs dans la maison. On ne s’adressa même pas à madame Maloir, qui écoutait d’un air désintéressé, n’ayant jamais sur elle que les six sous d’un omnibus. Enfin, Zoé sortit en disant qu’elle allait voir dans sa malle, et elle rapporta cent francs, en pièces de cent sous36. On les compta sur un bout de la table. Madame Lerat partit tout de suite, après avoir promis de ramener Louiset le lendemain.","The big difficulty was finding change. There were not ten francs in the house. They did not even speak to Madame Maloir, who listened with a disinterested air, never having more than the six sous of an omnibus with her.

Madame Lerat left immediately, after promising to bring Louiset back the next day.","The great difficulty was to get change. There were not ten francs in the place. They did not ask Madame Maloir, who was listening with an uninterested look, for she never had with her more than the six sous necessary for an omnibus. At length Zoé left them, saying that she would go and look in her trunk, and she shortly returned with a hundred francs, all in five franc pieces. They counted them on the corner of the table. Madame Lerat went off at once, promising to fetch little Louis on the morrow.","The big difficulty was how to find change. There were not ten francs in the house. But they did not even address themselves to Mme Maloir who, never having more than a six-sou omnibus fair upon her, was listening in quite a disinterested manner. At length Zoe went out of the room, remarking that she would go and look in her box, and she brought back a hundred francs in hundred-sou pieces. They were counted out on a corner of the table, and Mme Lerat took her departure at once after having promised to bring Louiset back with her the following day.","The problem was finding some change. There wasn’t ten francs in the whole house. Nobody bothered to ask Madame Maloir, who was listening dispassionately; she never had more than thirty centimes on her, for the bus-fare.

"Alors, Nana embrassa la femme de chambre. Puis, voulant montrer qu’elle n’était pas fâchée, elle lui donna une robe qu’elle avait mise trois fois. Leurs querelles finissaient toujours par des cadeaux. Zoé se tamponnait les yeux avec son mouchoir. Elle emporta la robe sur son bras, elle dit encore qu’on était bien triste à la cuisine, que Julien et François n’avaient pas pu manger, tant la colère de madame leur coupait l’appétit. Et madame leur envoya un louis, comme un gage de réconciliation. Le chagrin, autour d’elle, la faisait trop souffrir.","Then Nana kissed the maid. Then, wanting to show that she was not angry, she gave him a dress that she had worn three times. Their quarrels always ended in gifts. Zoe dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief. She carried the dress on her arm, she said again that they were very sad in the kitchen, that Julien and François had not been able to eat, so much did Madame's anger take away their appetite. And Madame sent them a louis, as a token of reconciliation. The grief around her made her suffer too much.","Then Nana kissed the maid. After which, wishing to show that she was not angry, she gave her a dress that she had worn only three times. Their quarrels always ended in presents. Zoé wiped her eyes with her handkerchief, and before carrying the dress off on her arm, she said that they were all very sad down in the kitchen, that Julien and Francois had not been able to eat any dinner, as madame’s anger had taken away all their appetite. And madame sent them a louis as a pledge of reconciliation. She could not bear to see any one unhappy.","Thereupon Nana kissed the lady's maid and, wishing to show her she wasn't vexed, gave her a dress she had worn three times. Their quarrels always ended up in the giving of presents! Zoe plugged her handkerchief into her eyes. She carried the dress off over her arm and added before leaving that they were very sad in the kitchen and that Julien and Francois had been unable to eat, so entirely had Madame's anger taken away their appetites. Thereupon Madame sent them a louis as a pledge of reconciliation. She suffered too much if people around her were sorrowful.","Nana kissed her. Then, to show she wasn’t cross, she gave her a dress she’d worn only three times. Their quarrels always ended with presents. Zoé went away with the dress over her arm, dabbing her eyes; she added that they were still miserable in the kitchen, Julien and François hadn’t been able to eat a bite, they’d quite lost their appetite as madam had been so angry with them. So madam sent each of them a twenty-franc piece to show her appreciation; seeing people looking miserable around her always made her so unhappy."

"La toile tombait, au milieu d’une salve prolongée d'applaudissements. Aussitôt, il y eut une débandade, dans la demi-obscurité de la scène, que la rampe n’éclairait plus ; les acteurs et les figurants se hâtaient de regagner leurs loges, tandis que les machinistes enlevaient rapidement le décor. Cependant, Simonne et Clarisse étaient restées au fond, causant à voix basse. En scène, entre deux de leurs répliques, elles venaient d’arranger une affaire. Clarisse, tout bien examiné, préférait ne pas voir la Faloise, qui ne se décidait plus à la lâcher pour se mettre avec Gaga. Simonne irait simplement lui expliquer qu’on ne se collait pas à une femme de cette façon. Enfin, elle l’exécuterait.","The canvas fell, amid a prolonged round of applause. Immediately, there was a rout, in the semi-darkness of the stage, which the ramp no longer lit; the actors and extras hurried back to their dressing rooms, while the stagehands quickly removed the scenery. However, Simonne and Clarisse had remained behind, talking in low voices. On stage, between two of their lines, they had just settled a deal. Clarisse, all well considered, preferred not to see La Faloise, who no longer made up her mind to let go of her to go with Gaga. Simonne would simply go and explain to him that you don't cling to a woman that way. Finally, she would execute him.","The curtain fell amidst thunders of applause. Immediately there was a regular stampede in the semi-obscurity of the stage, no longer under the glare of the foot-lights; the actors and the supers were hastening to reach their dressing-rooms, whilst the carpenters were rapidly changing the scenery. Simone and Clarisse, however, remained at the back of the stage, whispering together. During the last scene, between two of their lines, they had just arranged a little affair. Clarisse, after thinking the matter over, preferred not to see La Faloise, who no longer wished to leave her to go with Gaga. It would be better for Simone quietly to explain to him that it was not the thing to stick to a woman to that extent. In short, she was to send him about his business.","The curtain fell amid a long-drawn salvo of applause.

Immediately, in the semi-darkness on stage, no longer lit by the footlights, a wild scramble ensued; actors and extras hurried back to their dressing-rooms while the stage-hands quickly started changing the set.

During the act, in the course of a break in their parts, they’d come to an agreement: on due consideration, Clarisse thought it better not to see la Faloise, who was finding it impossible to make up his mind whether to leave her and set up with Gaga.

"La Faloise aurait pourtant bien voulu savoir le nom de la femme. Mais la comtesse avait rappelé Vandeuvres, qu’elle interrogeait sur la façon dont les Anglais faisaient le thé.

"Alors ce fut une confusion. La scène n’allait pas mieux. À son tour, Bordenave mimait, avec des grâces d’éléphant, tandis que Fauchery ricanait, en haussant les épaules de pitié. Puis, Fontan voulut s’en mêler, Bosc lui-même se permit des conseils. Éreintée, Rose avait fini par s’asseoir sur la chaise qui marquait la porte. On ne savait plus où l’on en était. Pour comble, Simonne, ayant cru entendre sa réplique, fit trop tôt son entrée, au milieu du désordre ; ce qui enragea Bordenave à un tel point, que, la canne lancée dans un moulinet terrible, il lui en allongea un grand coup sur le derrière. Souvent, il battait les femmes aux répétitions, quand il avait couché avec elles. Elle se sauva, poursuivie par ce cri furieux :","So it was a confusion. The scene was no better.

To make matters worse, Simonne, having thought she heard his reply, made her entrance too soon, in the midst of the disorder; which enraged Bordenave to such an extent that, throwing the cane into a terrible reel, he struck him hard on the behind. He often beat women at rehearsals when he slept with them. She ran away, pursued by this furious cry:","The scene went no better. The confusion became greater. Then Bordenave also began to mimic with the gracefulness of an elephant, whilst Fauchery stood by sneering and shrugging his shoulders, in a pitying sort of way. Then Fontan mixed himself up in it, and even Bosc ventured to give his advice. Rose, quite tired out, had finished by sitting down on the chair which indicated the door. No one any longer knew what they were about. To crown the confusion, Simone, thinking she heard her cue, made her entrance too soon, in the midst of the disorder. This so enraged Bordenave, that whirling his stick round in a terrible manner, it alighted with great force on her posterior. He often struck the women, who had been his mistresses, during rehearsals. She rushed off, pursued by this furious cry:","Then ensued confusion. The scene went no better than before. Bordenave, in his turn, showed them how to act it about as gracefully as an elephant might have done, while Fauchery sneered and shrugged pityingly.

No one knew where they had got to, and by way of finish to it all Simonne made a premature entry, under the impression that her cue had been given her, and arrived amid the confusion. This so enraged Bordenave that he whirled his stick round in a terrific manner and caught her a sounding thwack to the rearward. At rehearsal he used frequently to drub his former mistress. Simonne ran away, and this furious outcry followed her:","Everyone was confused; the scene still didn’t go any better. Bordenave himself started miming with all the grace of a bull elephant, while Fauchery shrugged his shoulders and sneered pityingly. Fontan now decided to take a hand himself, and even Bosc felt free to offer advice. Rose had sat down exhausted on the chair which represented the doorway. Nobody knew exactly what was happening. To complete the confusion, thinking she’d heard her cue, Simonne made her entrance too soon, which so enraged Bordenave that, brandishing his stick, he gave her an enormous wallop on her backside; at rehearsals he often whacked women he’d been to bed with.

"Depuis le matin, Nana avait des embêtements. D’abord, c’était le boulanger qui, dès neuf heures, avait paru avec sa note, une misère, cent trente-trois francs de pain qu’elle ne parvenait pas à solder, au milieu du train royal de l’hôtel. Il s’était présenté vingt fois, irrité d’avoir été changé19, du jour où il avait coupé le crédit ; et les domestiques épousaient sa cause. François disait que madame ne le paierait jamais s’il ne faisait pas une bonne scène, Charles parlait de monter aussi pour régler un vieux compte de paille resté en arrière, pendant que Victorine conseillait d’attendre la présence d’un monsieur et de tirer l’argent, en tombant en plein dans la conversation. La cuisine se passionnait, tous les fournisseurs étaient mis au courant, c’étaient des commérages de trois et quatre heures, madame déshabillée, épluchée, racontée, avec l’acharnement d’une domesticité oisive, qui crevait de bien-être. Seul, Julien, le maître d’hôtel, affectait de défendre madame : tout de même, elle était chic ; et quand les autres l’accusaient de coucher avec, il riait d’un air fat, ce qui mettait la cuisinière hors d’elle, car elle aurait voulu être un homme pour cracher sur le derrière de ces femmes, tant ça l’aurait dégoûtée. Méchamment, François avait posté le boulanger dans le vestibule, sans avertir madame. Comme elle descendait, madame le trouva devant elle, à l’heure du déjeuner. Elle prit la note, elle lui dit de revenir vers trois heures. Alors, avec de sales mots, il partit, en jurant d’être exact et de se payer lui-même, n’importe comment.","Since morning, Nana had been in trouble. First of all, it was the baker who, at nine o'clock, had appeared with his bill, a pittance, a hundred and thirty-three francs worth of bread which she could not manage to pay, in the middle of the royal train from the hotel. He had presented himself twenty times, irritated at having been changed, the day he had cut off the credit; and the servants espoused his cause. François said that Madame would never pay him if he didn't make a good scene, Charles talked about going upstairs too to settle an old straw account left behind, while Victorine advised waiting for a gentleman to be present and shooting. money, falling right into the conversation. The kitchen was passionate, all the suppliers were informed, there was gossip for three and four hours, Madame undressed, peeled, told, with the relentlessness of an idle servant, who was bursting with well-being. Only Julien, the butler, affected to defend Madame: all the same, she was smart; and when the others accused him of sleeping with him, he laughed smugly, which pissed the cook off, for she would have liked to be a man to spit on those women's behinds, so much would it have been. disgusted. Wickedly, François had posted the baker in the vestibule, without telling Madame. As she was going down, Madame found him in front of her, at lunchtime. She took the note, she told him to come back around three o'clock. So, with dirty words, he left, swearing to be exact and to pay himself, no matter how.","Ever since the morning Nana had had nothing but worry. First of all there was that baker, who, as early as nine o‘clock had called with his bill, a mere nothing—a hundred and thirty-three, francs’ worth of bread, which she had been unable to settle for, in the midst of her regal style of living. He had called twenty times, exasperated at having lost the custom on the day he had declined to give further credit; and the servants espoused his cause. François said that madame would never pay him if he did not make a great fuss; Charles talked of going upstairs to get an old bill for straw settled; whilst Victorine advised them to wait till some gentleman called, and to get the money by going to the drawing-room when he was there. The servants’ hall was deeply interested, all the tradespeople were kept informed of what was going on. There were gossipings of three and four hours’ duration. Madame was disrobed, pulled to pieces, talked about, with the rancour of idle menials bursting with good living. Julien, the butler, alone pretended to take madame’s part. She was, all the same, a fine woman; and when the others accused him of having enjoyed some of her favours, he laughed in a foppish sort of way, which put the cook beside herself, for she would have liked to have been a man to spit on such women, they disgusted her so much. François had maliciously left the baker waiting in the hall, without informing madame. As she came downstairs at lunch-time, she found herself face to face with him. She took his bill, and told him to call again about three o’clock. Then, muttering a number of filthy expressions, he went off, swearing to be punctual, and to pay himself some way or other.","Since morning Nana had been much worried. First of all it was the baker, who at nine o'clock had turned up, bill in hand. It was a wretched story. He had supplied her with bread to the amount of a hundred and thirty-three francs, and despite her royal housekeeping she could not pay it. In his irritation at being put off he had presented himself a score of times since the day he had refused further credit, and the servants were now espousing his cause. Francois kept saying that Madame would never pay him unless he made a fine scene; Charles talked of going upstairs, too, in order to get an old unpaid straw bill settled, while Victorine advised them to wait till some gentleman was with her, when they would get the money out of her by suddenly asking for it in the middle of conversation. The kitchen was in a savage mood: the tradesmen were all kept posted in the course events were taking, and there were gossiping consultations, lasting three or four hours on a stretch, during which Madame was stripped, plucked and talked over with the wrathful eagerness peculiar to an idle, overprosperous servants' hall. Julien, the house steward, alone pretended to defend his mistress. She was quite the thing, whatever they might say! And when the others accused him of sleeping with her he laughed fatuously, thereby driving the cook to distraction, for she would have liked to be a man in order to ""spit on such women's backsides,"" so utterly would they have disgusted her. Francois, without informing Madame of it, had wickedly posted the baker in the hall, and when she came downstairs at lunch time she found herself face to face with him. Taking the bill, she told him to return toward three o'clock, whereupon, with many foul expressions, he departed, vowing that he would have things properly settled and get his money by hook or by crook.","Nana had been having problems all that day. To start with, at nine o’clock the baker turned up with his account, a mere trifle, a bread-bill for a hundred and thirty-three francs which, with her sumptuous style of living, she had never got round to paying. He’d called a score of times before, annoyed at being replaced by another baker the moment he’d cut off her credit. He had the backing of the servants. François was saying that his mistress would never pay up unless he kicked up a real fuss, Charles was talking of going upstairs himself to get a long-overdue bill for straw settled, while Victorine advised waiting until Nana had a gentleman with her and extracting the money by breaking into the ‘conversation’ without warning. The servants were quite worked up; they used to keep the tradesmen fully informed and spend hours gossiping, revealing their mistress in all her nakedness, giving every possible detail, with the cantankerous pettiness of servants who are living in clover and haven’t enough to do. Only the butler Julien made a point of standing up for his mistress : she wasn’t a bad sort, really; and when the others accused him of going to bed with her he gave a fatuous grin which enraged the cook, who wished she was a man so as to be able to spit on the backside of such revolting women … Without warning his mistress, François had spitefully stationed the baker in the vestibule so that when she came down to lunch she ran into him face to face. She took the bill and told him to come back at about three o’clock. He took himself off, muttering abuse and promising he’d be back on time and get paid, by hook or by crook."

"Elle avait cessé son métier de fleuriste et vivait de ses économies, six cents francs de rentes amassés sou à sou. Nana promit de lui louer un joli petit logement ; en outre, elle lui donnerait cent francs par mois. À ce chiffre, la tante s’oublia, cria à la nièce de leur serrer le gaviot26, puisqu’elle les tenait ; elle parlait des hommes. Toutes deux s’embrassèrent encore. Mais Nana, au milieu de sa joie, comme elle remettait la conversation sur Louiset, parut s’assombrir à un brusque souvenir.","She had given up her job as a florist and was living off her savings, six hundred francs amassed penny by penny. Nana promised to rent him a nice little apartment; besides, she would give him a hundred francs a month.

But Nana, in the midst of her joy, as she turned the conversation back to Louiset, seemed to grow gloomy at a sudden memory.","She had given up her artificial flower-making business and retired on her savings—six hundred francs a year—hoarded up sou by sou. Nana promised to take some nice rooms for her, besides which she would allow her one hundred francs a month. When she heard this the aunt quite forgot herself in her delight, and impressed upon her niece that she should squeeze them whilst she had the chance. She was alluding to the men. Then they kissed each other again. But Nana, in the midst of her joy, and just as she had once more begun to talk of little Louis, seemed to get sad at some sudden recollection.","She had retired from business as a florist and was living on her savings, which she had got together sou by sou, till now they brought her in an income of six hundred francs a year. Nana promised to rent some pretty little lodgings for her and to give her a hundred francs a month besides. At the mention of this sum the aunt forgot herself and shrieked to her niece, bidding her squeeze their throats, since she had them in her grasp. She was meaning the men, of course. Then they both embraced again, but in the midst of her rejoicing Nana's face, as she led the talk back to the subject of Louiset, seemed to be overshadowed by a sudden recollection.","She had given up her job as a florist and was living on a pension of six hundred francs from savings which she’d put together cent by cent. Nana promised to rent a nice little flat for her and give her a hundred francs a month in addition. The mention of this sum made the good lady quite forget herself, and she exclaimed that now her niece had got them by the short hair she mustn’t let go—she was referring to men. They both kissed each other again. In the middle of this happy scene, Nana brought the conversation back to little Louis; she suddenly seemed to remember something that depressed her."

Mais, comme le prince disait que, si elle venait chanter à Londres, toute l’Angleterre voudrait l’applaudir, elle eut un rire aimable, elle se tourna une seconde, la joue gauche très blanche, au milieu d’un nuage de poudre.

Dès le potage, dans cette salle à manger superbe, éclairée du reflet de l’argenterie et des cristaux, elle tourna au sentiment, elle célébra les bonheurs de la pauvreté. Les hommes étaient en habit, elle-même portait une robe de satin blanc brodé, tandis que Satin, plus modeste, en soie noire, avait simplement au cou un cœur d’or, un cadeau de sa bonne amie. Et, derrière les convives, Julien et François servaient, aidés de Zoé, tous les trois très dignes.","During dinner, Nana was nervous. The sight of the eighty thousand francs had agitated her. To think that all this currency was going to go to suppliers! It disgusted her. From the soup, in this superb dining room, lit by the reflection of silverware and crystals, she turned to sentiment, she celebrated the joys of poverty. The men were in full dress, she herself wore an embroidered white satin dress, while Satin, more modest, in black silk, simply had a heart of gold around her neck, a gift from her good friend. And, behind the guests, Julien and François served, helped by Zoé, all three very dignified.","During dinner Nana was very nervous. The sight of the eighty thousand francs had upset her. To think that all that money was going to be paid away to tradespeople! It annoyed her immensely. As soon as the soup was served in that superb dining-room, illuminated with the reflection of the silver plate and the crystal ware, she became sentimental, and began to praise the joys of poverty. The men were in evening dress. She herself, wore a dress of embroidered white satin, whilst Satin, more modest, and in black silk, had merely a golden heart—a present from her darling friend—at her throat; and behind the guests Julien and François waited, assisted by Zoé, all three looking very dignified.","During dinnertime Nana was nervous. The sight of the eighty thousand francs had excited her. To think all that money was to go to tradespeople! It was a disgusting thought. After soup had been served she grew sentimental, and in the splendid dining room, glittering with plate and glass, she talked of the bliss of poverty. The men were in evening dress, Nana in a gown of white embroidered satin, while Satin made a more modest appearance in black silk with a simple gold heart at her throat, which was a present from her kind friend. Julien and Francois waited behind the guests and were assisted in this by Zoe. All three looked most dignified.","During dinner Nana was jumpy; the sight of those eighty thousand francs had unsettled her. To think of all that money going to tradesmen! It was disgusting. As soon as the soup had been served in this magnificent dining-room, resplendent with gleaming silver and cut-glass, she became sentimental and started extolling the delights of poverty. The men were wearing full evening dress and she herself was dressed in an embroidered satin gown, while Satin, more modestly, was in black silk and wearing a simple, heart-shaped gold pendant, a present from her sweetheart Nana. Standing behind the guests, Julien and François were serving, helped by Zoé: all three were looking extremely dignified."
"Et elle se récria sur la gentillesse des pièces. Nana lui fit visiter la chambre, la salle à manger, jusqu’à la cuisine. Dame ! ce n’était pas immense, mais on avait refait les peintures, changé les papiers ; et le soleil entrait là gaiement.","And she exclaimed over the niceness of the pieces. Nana showed him around the bedroom, the dining room, even the kitchen. Lady ! it wasn't huge, but the paint had been redone, the papers changed; and the sun entered there cheerfully.","And she praised the prettiness of the rooms. Nana showed her everything in the bedroom and the dining-room, and even in the kitchen. Well! they were not large, but they had been newly painted and papered; and the sun shone there so brilliantly.","And with that she went into raptures over the prettiness of the rooms. Nana took her to see the bedroom, the parlor and the very kitchen. Gracious goodness, it wasn't a vast place, but then, they had painted it afresh and put up new wallpapers. Besides, the sun shone merrily into it during the daytime.","And she exclaimed how nice the rooms were. Nana showed her round the bedroom, the dining-room, even the kitchen. Of course it wasn’t palatial, but they’d done the paint up and changed the wallpaper and it was cheerful and sunny."
"Alors, la tête perdue, il lui barra la porte ; et il pleurait, et il la suppliait, joignant les mains, balbutiant :","Then, his head lost, he barred the door for her; and he wept, and he begged her, clasping his hands, stammering:","Then, in a state of bewilderment, he stood before the door; and he cried, and implored, clasping his hands together, and muttering, “Oh, no!","At these words his head spun, and he barred her egress.

"Alors, il se ramassa, péniblement ; et, sans force, il tomba sur la chaise, accoudé au dossier, le visage entre les mains. Nana marchait à son tour. Un moment, elle regarda le papier taché, la toilette grasse, ce trou sale qui baignait dans un soleil pâle. Puis, s’arrêtant devant le comte, elle parla avec une carrure tranquille.","Then he picked himself up, painfully; and, without strength, he fell on the chair, leaning on the back, his face between his hands. Nana walked in her turn. For a moment she looked at the stained paper, the greasy toilet, that dirty hole bathed in a pale sun. Then, stopping in front of the Count, she spoke with a calm build.","Then he regained his feet painfully, and having no strength left, he dropped on to the chair, leaning against the back, his face buried in his hands. Nana in her turn, walked about. For a moment she looked at the stained wall-paper, the greasy dressing-table, all over that dirty hole, bathed in the pale sunlight. Then stopping in front of the count, she spoke without the slightest emotion.","With that he gathered himself up painfully and feebly dropped into a chair, in which he leaned back with his face in his hands. Nana began pacing up and down in her turn. For a second or two she looked at the stained wallpaper, the greasy toilet table, the whole dirty little room as it basked in the pale sunlight. Then she paused in front of the count and spoke with quiet directness.","He picked himself up laboriously and fell exhausted on to the chair, resting his chin on its back and holding his head in his hands. It was Nana’s turn to start walking up and down. For a moment she gazed at the stained wallpaper, the greasy wash-stand, this filthy hole bathed in pale sunlight. Then, standing squarely in front of him, she said calmly:"

"Mais ces petits jeux se gâtèrent bientôt. Ce ne fut pas cruauté chez elle, car elle demeurait bonne fille ; ce fut comme un vent de démence qui passa et grandit peu à peu dans la chambre close. Une luxure 49 les détraquait, les jetait aux imaginations délirantes de la chair. Les anciennes épouvantes dévotes de leur nuit d’insomnie tournaient maintenant en une soif de bestialité, une fureur de se mettre à quatre pattes, de grogner et de mordre. Puis, un jour, comme il faisait l’ours, elle le poussa si rudement, qu’il tomba contre un meuble ; et elle éclata d’un rire involontaire, en lui voyant une bosse au front. Dès lors, mise en goût par son essai sur la Faloise, elle le traita en animal, le fouailla, le poursuivit à coups de pied.","But these little games soon spoiled. There was no cruelty with her, for she remained a good girl; it was like a wind of madness which passed and grew little by little in the closed room. A lust 49 threw them out of whack, threw them into the delirious imaginations of the flesh. The old devout terrors of their sleepless night now turned into a lust for bestiality, a fury to get on all fours, to growl and bite. Then, one day, as he was playing bear, she pushed him so roughly that he fell against a piece of furniture; and she burst into an involuntary laugh on seeing a bump on his forehead. From then on, infatuated by her essay on La Faloise, she treated him like an animal, flogged him, chased him with kicks.","But these little games soon took an ugly turn. It wasn’t through cruelty on her part, for she still remained a good-natured girl; it was like a breath of madness, which passed and increased little by little in the closed room. A lewdness seemed to possess them, and inspire them with the delirious imaginations of the flesh. The old devout frights of their night of wakefulness had now turned into a thirst for bestiality, a mania for going on all fours, for grunting and biting. Then one day, as he was doing the woolly bear, she pushed him so roughly that he fell against a piece of furniture; and she broke out into an involuntary laugh as she saw a bump on his forehead. From that time, having already acquired a taste for it by her experiment on La Faloise, she treated him as an animal, goaded him and pursued him with kicks.","But ere long these little games were spoiled. It was not cruelty in her case, for she was still a good-natured girl; it was as though a passing wind of madness were blowing ever more strongly in the shut- up bedroom. A storm of lust disordered their brains, plunged them into the delirious imaginations of the flesh. The old pious terrors of their sleepless nights were now transforming themselves into a thirst for bestiality, a furious longing to walk on all fours, to growl and to bite. One day when he was playing bear she pushed him so roughly that he fell against a piece of furniture, and when she saw the lump on his forehead she burst into involuntary laughter. After that her experiments on La Faloise having whetted her appetite, she treated him like an animal, threshing him and chasing him to an accompaniment of kicks.","But soon the sport turned nasty. With her, it wasn’t cruelty, because she was still a good-natured girl; it was as if a growing wave of violence was sweeping through the closed bedroom and making wild beasts of them both, filling their minds with delirious sexual fantasies. Their earlier pious fears, when they would lie awake at night, had been replaced by bestial impulses, a mad urge to get down on all fours and bite. Then one day as he was pretending to be a bear, she gave him such a violent shove that he fell against a piece of furniture, and when she saw the bump on his forehead she couldn’t help laughing. From then on, with pleasant memories of what she’d done to la Faloise, she took to beating and kicking him about like an animal."
"9. On voit donc dans le salon le mélange qui selon Zola caractérise le Second Empire, représenté aussi dans le roman L’Argent : la vieille aristocratie (Sabine, fille du marquis de Chouard), conquise par le nouveau régime (le comte, héritier du Premier Empire, tout naturellement passé au Second), qui fraie maintenant avec les milieux d’affaires (Steiner), le tout entraîné par le goût des plaisirs (Léonide ou Foucarmont), sans oublier la puissance de l’Église (plus loin, M. Venot, voir p. 90), et la presse (Fauchery, qui analyse la composition de ce salon, p. 100).","9. So we see in the salon the mixture which, according to Zola, characterizes the Second Empire, also represented in the novel L'Argent: the old aristocracy (Sabine, daughter of the Marquis de Chouard), conquered by the new regime (the count, heir of the First Empire, quite naturally passed to the Second), which now spawns with business circles (Steiner), all driven by the taste for pleasures (Léonide or Foucarmont), without forgetting the power of the Church (further on, M. Venot, see p. 90), and the press (Fauchery, who analyzes the composition of this salon, p. 100).",called La Faloise to him from the hall.,"""Tomorrow, at Nana's.""",la Faloise called up from the hall.

In the 19th century, we still love plump beauties!","She occupied, in the Boulevard Haussmann, the second storey of a large new house, the owner of which was content to let to single ladies, in order to get his plaster dried.","The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop--to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze.","The flat was far too big for her and had never been completely furnished; the flashy, opulent, gilt chairs and console tables formed a violent contrast to the second-hand junk, mahogany pedestal tables and zinc candelabra pretending to be Florentine bronze."
"Et elle rejoignit Labordette qui l’attendait dans l’escalier. Tout le théâtre l’avait reconnue. On chuchotait, Prullière scandalisé de cette rentrée, Clarisse très inquiète pour le rôle. Quant à Fontan, il jouait l’indifférence, l’air froid, car ce n’était pas à lui de taper sur une femme qu’il avait aimée ; au fond, dans son ancienne toquade tournée à la haine, il lui gardait une rancune féroce de ses dévouements, de sa beauté, de cette vie à deux dont il n’avait plus voulu, par une perversion de ses goûts de monstre.","And she rejoined Labordette, who was waiting for her on the stairs. The whole theater had recognized her. We whispered, Prullière scandalized by this comeback, Clarisse very worried about the role. As for Fontan, he played with indifference, with a cold air, because it was not his place to hit a woman he had loved; Basically, in his old infatuation turned to hatred, he harbored a fierce grudge against her for her devotion, her beauty, this life together which he had no longer wanted, through a perversion of his monster tastes.","And she joined Labordette, who was waiting for her on the stairs. Every one in the theatre had recognised her. They were all whispering together. Her return quite scandalised Prullière, and Clarisse was very uneasy about the part she was longing for. As for Fontan, he pretended supreme indifference. It was not for him to abuse a woman he had loved. In his heart—in his old infatuation now turned to hatred—he entertained a ferocious grudge against her on account of her devotion to him, of her beauty, and of that dual existence which he had severed through the perversion of his monster-like inclinations.","And she rejoined Labordette, who was waiting for her on the stairs. Everybody in the theater had recognized her, and there was now much whispering, especially between Prulliere, who was scandalized at her return, and Clarisse who was very desirous of the part. As to Fontan, he looked coldly on, pretending unconcern, for he did not think it becoming to round on a woman he had loved. Deep down in his heart, though, his old love had turned to hate, and he nursed the fiercest rancor against her in return for the constant devotion, the personal beauty, the life in common, of which his perverse and monstrous tastes had made him tire.","And she caught up with Labordette waiting for her at the staircase. The whole cast had recognized her; people were whispering together. Prullière was scandalized to see her back, Clarisse very worried about her part. As for Fontan, he pretended to be unconcerned and unmoved; it wasn’t for him to run down a woman he’d loved, although at heart, now that his recent infatuation for her had turned into hatred, he was still nursing a savage resentment towards her because of the devotion she’d shown him, her beauty, and their life together which he’d thrown away through his revolting conduct."

"Il arrivait seulement, et il gueulait déjà contre deux figurantes, qui avaient failli s’étaler en scène, parce qu’elles faisaient les imbéciles. Quand il aperçut Mignon et Fauchery, il les appela, pour leur montrer quelque chose : le prince venait de demander à complimenter Nana dans sa loge, pendant l’entracte. Mais, comme il les emmenait sur le théâtre, le régisseur passa.","He was just arriving, and he was already yelling at two extras, who had almost flopped on stage, because they were fooling around.

But as he was taking them on to the stage, the stage-manager passed.","He had only just come up, and he was already howling complaints about two chorus girls who had nearly fallen flat on the stage because they were playing the fool together. When his eye lit on Mignon and Fauchery he called them; he wanted to show them something. The prince had just notified a desire to compliment Nana in her dressing room during the next interval. But as he was leading them into the wings the stage manager passed.","This husky roar came from Bordenave who had only just arrived and was already exploding because of two extras who’d nearly fallen flat on their faces on stage as a result of fooling around.

"En effet, l’hôtel paraissait bouleversé. Tous les domestiques galopaient à travers l’escalier et les pièces. Georges venait de passer la nuit sur un fauteuil du salon. C'était lui qui avait annoncé la nouvelle aux amis de madame, le soir, à l’heure où madame recevait d’habitude. Il restait pâle, il racontait l’histoire, plein de stupeur et d’émotion. Steiner, la Faloise, Philippe, d’autres encore, s’étaient présentés. Dès la première phrase, ils poussaient une exclamation ; pas possible ! ça devait être une farce ! Ensuite, ils devenaient sérieux, ils regardaient la porte de la chambre, l’air ennuyé, hochant la tête, ne trouvant pas ça drôle. Jusqu’à minuit, une douzaine de messieurs avaient causé bas devant la cheminée, tous amis, tous travaillés par la même idée de paternité3. Ils semblaient s’excuser entre eux, avec des mines confuses de maladroits. Puis, ils arrondissaient le dos, ça ne les regardait pas, ça venait d’elle ; hein ? épatante, cette Nana ! jamais on n’aurait cru à une pareille blague de sa part ! Et ils s’en étaient allés un à un, sur la pointe des pieds, comme dans la chambre d’un mort, où l’on ne peut plus rire.","Indeed, the hotel seemed upset. All the servants galloped up the stairs and the rooms. Georges had just spent the night on an armchair in the living room. It was he who had announced the news to Madame's friends, in the evening, at the hour when Madame usually entertained. He remained pale, he told the story, full of amazement and emotion. Steiner, La Faloise, Philippe, and still others, had presented themselves. From the first sentence, they uttered an exclamation; Not possible ! it must have been a prank! Then they would get serious, they would stare at the bedroom door, looking bored, shaking their heads, not finding it funny. Until midnight, a dozen gentlemen had chatted in front of the fireplace, all friends, all tormented by the same idea of paternity. They seemed to be apologizing to each other, with confused, clumsy faces. Then they arched their backs, it was none of their business, it came from her; eh ? amazing, this Nana! we would never have believed such a joke on his part! And they had gone away one by one, on tiptoe, as in the chamber of a dead man, where one can no longer laugh.","And indeed the house seemed topsy-turvy. All the servants were continually running about the rooms and up and down stairs. George had passed the night on a chair in the drawing-room. It was he who had told the news to madame’s friends who had called in the evening at the time when madame usually received. He was very pale, and he related the story full of astonishment and emotion. Steiner, La Faloise, Philippe, and several others had called. At his first words they uttered exclamations. It could not be! it must be a joke! Then they became very serious. They glanced at the bed-room door, looking very much put out, shaking their heads, no longer thinking it a funny matter. Up to midnight a dozen gentlemen had conversed in undertones in front of the fire-place, all of them friends, and each one wondering if he were the father. They seemed to be apologising to one another, with the confused looks of awkward people. Then they assumed their airs again. It was nothing to do with them; it was her fault entirely. She was a scorcher, that Nana! One would never have expected such a joke from her! And they went off one by one, on tiptoe, the same as in the chamber of death, where one must never laugh.","In fact, the house seemed utterly upset. All the servants were galloping upstairs, downstairs and through the rooms. Georges had passed the night on an armchair in the drawing room. It was he who had announced the news to Madame's friends at that hour of the evening when Madame was in the habit of receiving. He had still been very pale, and he had told his story very feelingly, and as though stupefied. Steiner, La Faloise, Philippe and others, besides, had presented themselves, and at the end of the lad's first phrase they burst into exclamations. The thing was impossible! It must be a farce! After which they grew serious and gazed with an embarrassed expression at her bedroom door. They shook their heads; it was no laughing matter. Till midnight a dozen gentlemen had stood talking in low voices in front of the fireplace. All were friends; all were deeply exercised by the same idea of paternity. They seemed to be mutually excusing themselves, and they looked as confused as if they had done something clumsy. Eventually, however, they put a bold face on the matter. It had nothing to do with them: the fault was hers! What a stunner that Nana was, eh? One would never have believed her capable of such a fake! And with that they departed one by one, walking on tiptoe, as though in a chamber of death where you cannot laugh.","Indeed, the whole house seemed upside-down. The servants were scurrying upstairs and downstairs and all over the house. Georges had spent the night in an armchair in the drawing-room. It was he who’d given the news to madam’s friends when they’d called at the time madam was usually ‘at home’. He was as white as a sheet and still in a terribly confused and emotional state when he explained what had happened, and when Steiner, la Faloise, Philippe, and the others heard what he had to say, they all exclaimed in amazement. It couldn’t be true! It must be a joke! Then they looked solemn and cast irritated glances towards her door, shaking their heads and not finding it funny at all. A dozen menfriends of Nana had stayed on till midnight chatting in low voices round the fireplace, all with the same worrying thought in their minds: they might be the father. They seemed uncomfortable and confused, rather apologetic towards each other. Then they cheered up; it wasn’t any concern of theirs, after all, it was her baby. What an extraordinary girl Nana was, wasn’t she? You’d never have credited her with a lark like that, would you? And then they’d all tiptoed away as if they were in a death-chamber where it’s forbidden to laugh."

"Les pas cadencés revenaient. Elles fermèrent la fenêtre. En se retournant, Nana, grelottante, les cheveux mouillés, resta un instant saisie devant son salon, comme si elle avait oublié et qu’elle fût rentrée dans un endroit inconnu. Elle retrouvait là un air si tiède, si parfumé, qu’elle en éprouvait une surprise heureuse. Les richesses entassées, les meubles anciens, les étoffes de soie d’or, les ivoires, les bronzes, dormaient dans la lumière rose des lampes ; tandis que, de tout l’hôtel muet, montait la sensation pleine d’un grand luxe, la solennité des salons de réception, l’ampleur confortable de la salle à manger, le recueillement du vaste escalier, avec la douceur des tapis et des sièges. C'était un élargissement brusque d’elle-même, de ses besoins de domination et de jouissance, de son envie de tout avoir pour tout détruire. Jamais elle n’avait senti si profondément la force de son sexe. Elle promena un lent regard, elle dit d’un air de grave philosophie :","The rhythmic steps returned. They closed the window. Turning round, Nana, shivering, her hair wet, remained seized for a moment in front of her living room, as if she had forgotten and had returned to an unknown place. She found there an air so warm, so fragrant, that she felt a happy surprise. The heaps of wealth, the antique furniture, the stuffs of golden silk, the ivories, the bronzes, slept in the rosy light of the lamps; while throughout the mute hotel rose the feeling full of great luxury, the solemnity of the reception rooms, the comfortable spaciousness of the dining room, the contemplation of the vast staircase, with the softness of the carpets and the seats. It was a sudden widening of herself, of her needs for domination and enjoyment, of her desire to have everything in order to destroy everything. She had never felt the strength of her sex so deeply. She looked around slowly, she said with an air of serious philosophy:","The sound of footsteps returned. They closed the window. On turning round, Nana, shivering and with her hair all wet, on beholding the room, remained, as it were, struck with astonishment, as though she had never seen it before and had entered some unknown place. She found the atmosphere so warm, so perfumed, that she experienced a pleasant surprise. The wealth piled up around the ancient furniture, the gold and silk stuffs, the ivory, the bronzes, all seemed reposing in the rosy light of the lamps; whilst from the now hushed house there arose the sensation of a great luxury—the solemnity of the grand drawing-room, the comfortable amplitude of the dining-room, the peacefulness of the vast staircase, with the softness of the seats and carpets. It was like an abrupt expansion of herself, of her requirements of domination and enjoyment, of her wish to possess everything merely to destroy it. Never before had she felt so strongly the power of her sex. She glanced slowly around her, and then said with an air of grave philosophy,","The measured steps were returning, and they shut the window. Turning round again, shivering, and with the damp of night on her hair, Nana was momentarily astounded at sight of her drawing room. It seemed as though she had forgotten it and were entering an unknown chamber. So warm, so full of perfume, was the air she encountered that she experienced a sense of delighted surprise. The heaped-up wealth of the place, the Old World furniture, the fabrics of silk and gold, the ivory, the bronzes, were slumbering in the rosy light of the lamps, while from the whole of the silent house a rich feeling of great luxury ascended, the luxury of the solemn reception rooms, of the comfortable, ample dining room, of the vast retired staircase, with their soft carpets and seats. Her individuality, with its longing for domination and enjoyment and its desire to possess everything that she might destroy everything, was suddenly increased. Never before had she felt so profoundly the puissance of her sex. She gazed slowly round and remarked with an expression of grave philosophy:","The tramping feet were coming back. They shut the window. As she turned round, shivering, with her face wet, Nana stood for a second in amazement at the sight of her drawing-room as if she’d forgotten where she was and had been in some strange place. The air was so warm and scented that she felt surprised and very happy. This accumulation of precious objects, antique furniture, silks, gold embroideries, ivories, and bronzes lay peacefully bathed in the light of the lamps while the whole of the magnificent house was permeated by a feeling of luxury, the majestic reception-rooms, the vast, comfortable dining-room, the reverent atmosphere of the staircase, the soft rugs and chairs. It was like a sudden extension of her own personality , her need for power and pleasure, her urge to possess everything in order to destroy everything. Never before had she felt so deeply the immense force of her sexuality. Looking slowly around, she said with an earnest, philosophical air:"

"Rose tourna la tête. Elle buvait son café à petites gorgées, elle regardait Steiner fixement, très pâle ; et toute la colère contenue de son abandon passa dans ses yeux comme une flamme. Elle voyait plus clair que Mignon ; c’était bête d’avoir voulu recommencer l’affaire de Jonquier, ces machines-là ne réussissaient pas deux fois. Tant pis ! elle aurait Fauchery, elle s’en toquait depuis le souper ; et si Mignon n’était pas content, ça lui apprendrait.","Rose turned her head. She drank her coffee in small sips, she stared at Steiner, very pale; and all the suppressed anger of his abandonment flashed in his eyes like a flame. She saw more clearly than Mignon; it was foolish to have wanted to start the Jonquier business all over again, those machines didn't succeed twice. Too bad ! she would have Fauchery, she had been making fun of him since supper; and if Mignon was not happy, that would teach him.","Rose turned her head. Her face was very pale as she looked fixedly at Steiner, slowly sipping her coffee the while, and all the repressed anger she felt at her abandonment gleamed in her eyes like a flame of fire. She understood the matter better than Mignon. It was absurd to try and repeat the Jonquier experiment. That sort of things did not come off twice. Well, so much the worse! she would have Fauchery. She had felt a hankering for him ever since the supper, and if Mignon didn’t like it, it would teach him to act differently another time.","Rose turned round. She was very pale and gazed fixedly at Steiner as she sipped her coffee. And then all the concentrated anger she felt at his abandonment of her flamed out in her eyes. She saw more clearly than Mignon; it was stupid in him to have wished to begin the Jonquier ruse a second time--those dodgers never succeeded twice running. Well, so much the worse for him! She would have Fauchery! She had been getting enamored of him since the beginning of supper, and if Mignon was not pleased it would teach him greater wisdom!","Rose looked round. She was sipping her coffee slowly and staring at Steiner, very pale; for a brief moment her pent-up anger at his desertion flared up in her eyes. She was more clear-sighted than Mignon; it was stupid to hope to bring off the Jonquier trick again, that sort of thing never worked twice. Never mind! She’d have Fauchery, to whom she’d taken a strong fancy at the supper; and if Mignon didn’t like it, that would teach him a lesson."

"Alors, quand elle le sentit si humble, Nana eut le triomphe tyrannique. Elle apportait d’instinct la rage d’avilir. Il ne lui suffisait pas de détruire les choses, elle les salissait. Ses mains si fines laissaient des traces abominables, décomposaient d’elles-mêmes tout ce qu’elles avaient cassé. Et lui, imbécile, se prêtait à ce jeu, avec le vague souvenir des saints dévorés de poux et qui mangeaient leurs excréments48. Lorsqu’elle le tenait dans sa chambre, les portes closes, elle se donnait le régal de l’infamie de l’homme. D’abord, ils avaient plaisanté, elle lui allongeait de légères tapes, lui imposait des volontés drôles, le faisait zézayer comme un enfant, répéter des fins de phrase.","So, when she felt him so humble, Nana had tyrannical triumph. She instinctively brought the rage to degrade. It was not enough for her to destroy things, she made them dirty. His slender hands left abominable traces, decomposing by themselves everything they had broken. And he, imbecile, lent himself to this game, with the vague memory of the saints devoured by lice and who ate their excrements. When she held him in her bedroom, with the doors closed, she feasted on the man's infamy. At first, they had joked, she gave him light pats, imposed funny wishes on him, made him lisp like a child, repeat the end of sentences.","Then when she found him so humble, Nana’s triumph became tyrannical. She instinctively had a rage for debasing everything. It was not sufficient for her to destroy things; she polluted them. Her delicate hands left abominable traces behind them; they decomposed by their mere touch all that they had broken. And he, idiot that he was, lent himself to this sport, with the vague remembrance of saints devoured by lice, and who eat what they had voided. When she had him in her room, with the doors fastened, she would feast herself with the sight of man’s infamy. At first it was merely fun. She would give him little slaps and make him do comical things, such as lisping like a child, repeating ends of sentences.","Then when she felt how humble he was Nana grew tyrannously triumphant. The rage for debasing things was inborn in her. It did not suffice her to destroy them; she must soil them too. Her delicate hands left abominable traces and themselves decomposed whatever they had broken. And he in his imbecile condition lent himself to this sort of sport, for he was possessed by vaguely remembered stories of saints who were devoured by vermin and in turn devoured their own excrements. When once she had him fast in her room and the doors were shut, she treated herself to a man's infamy. At first they joked together, and she would deal him light blows and impose quaint tasks on him, making him lisp like a child and repeat tags of sentences.","When she realized his utter abjection, Nana’s triumph turned to tyranny; she had a passionate and instinctive desire to degrade; not satisfied with destroying things, she had to debase them. Her dainty hands carried foul infection and anything they broke went rotten. And, idiot-like, he went along with her, with vague memories of saints devoured by lice and eating their own excrement. When she’d got him behind closed doors in her bedroom, she gave herself the treat of celebrating the depravity of mankind. In the beginning it was just a joke; she would hit him, gently, and order him to do odd things, such as use baby-talk in finishing his sentences:"
"« Vois donc ! dit-elle, arrêtée de nouveau devant un bijoutier, quel drôle de bracelet ! »","“Look! she said, stopping again in front of a jeweler, what a funny bracelet! »","“Oh! Look there!” she exclaimed, stopping in front of a jeweller’s, “what a funny bracelet! ”","""Now do look!"" she said, pausing anew before a jeweler's window, ""what a funny bracelet!""",‘Just look at that odd bracelet!’ she exclaimed stopping in front of another jeweller’s shop.

Il voulait simplement dire à madame qu’il ne pouvait venir ce soir. »","""That one, Madame, I fired him a long time ago,"" said Zoe with a smile. He simply wanted to tell Madame that he could not come this evening. »","“I sent him off a long time ago, madame,” said Zoé with a smile. “He merely wished to tell madame that he couldn’t come to-night.”","""Oh, as to him, madame, I gave him his marching orders a while ago,"" said Zoe with a grin.

"Elle était devenue sérieuse, la voix dure, très émue, souffrant réellement de son bête de désir. Muffat, toujours sous le coup de ses refus, attendait, sans comprendre. Il y eut un silence. Pas un vol de mouche ne troublait la paix de la maison vide.","She had become serious, her voice hard, very moved, really suffering from her beast of desire. Muffat, still reeling from his refusals, waited, without understanding. There was a silence. Not a flying fly disturbed the peace of the empty house.","She spoke in a harsh tone of voice. She had become serious now, and was greatly affected, suffering from her stupid desire. Muffat, not yet recovered from the blow of her refusals, waited without understanding. There was a short silence, which was not disturbed by the least sound.","And with that she grew serious, speaking in a hard voice and looking deeply moved, for she was really tortured by her stupid, tiresome wish. Muffat, still smarting from her late refusals, sat on without appearing to grasp her meaning. There was a silence during which the very flies abstained from buzzing through the quiet, empty place.","making me very unhappy, I’ve got to have it, do you understand?’ She’d become very serious , her voice was harsh and full of emotion, her silly ambition was making her really distressed. Still cowed by seeing her turn down all his offers, Muffat sat waiting, not understanding what she was driving at. There was complete silence; in the empty house you could have heard a pin drop."
"Ce fut un accès de fou rire dans la voiture. Les jeunes gens trouvaient le mot très drôle ; tandis que Louiset, sans comprendre, levait ses yeux pâles vers sa mère, dont les éclats de voix le surprenaient. Labordette, d’ailleurs, ne put encore s’échapper. Rose Mignon lui avait fait un signe ; et elle lui donnait des ordres, il inscrivait des chiffres sur un calepin. Puis, ce furent Clarisse et Gaga qui le rappelèrent, pour changer leurs paris ; elles avaient entendu des mots dans la foule, elles ne voulaient plus de Valerio II et prenaient Lusignan ; lui, impassible, écrivait. Enfin, il se sauva, on le vit qui disparaissait, de l’autre côté de la piste, entre deux tribunes.","There was a fit of giggles in the car. Young people found the word very funny; while Louiset, without understanding, raised her pale eyes to her mother, whose outbursts of voice surprised him. Labordette, moreover, could not yet escape. Rose Mignon had given him a sign; and she was giving him orders, he was writing numbers on a notebook. Then it was Clarisse and Gaga who called him back, to change their bets; they had heard words in the crowd, they no longer wanted Valerio II and took Lusignan; he, impassive, was writing. Finally, he ran away, we saw him disappearing, on the other side of the track, between two stands.","They all laughed madly in the carriage. The young men thought it very funny, whilst little Louis, without understanding, raised his pale eyes to his mother, the loud accents of whose voice surprised him. Labordette, however, was still unable to get off. Rose Mignon had beckoned him, and she gave him some instructions which he wrote down in his note-book; then Clarisse and Gaga called him back, as they wished to modify their bets; they had heard different things in the crowd, and would no longer back Valerio II., but went in for Lusignan; he, quite impassible, made notes of what they required. At length he got away, and was seen to disappear between two of the stands on the other side of the course.","There was a burst of uproarious laughter in the carriage. The young men thought her sally very amusing, while Louiset in his ignorance lifted his pale eyes to his mother's face, for her loud exclamations surprised him. However, there was no escape for Labordette as yet. Rose Mignon had made a sign to him and was now giving him her commands while he wrote figures in a notebook. Then Clarisse and Gaga called him back in order to change their bets, for they had heard things said in the crowd, and now they didn't want to have anything more to do with Valerio II and were choosing Lusignan. He wrote down their wishes with an impassible expression and at length managed to escape. He could be seen disappearing between two of the stands on the other side of the course.","There was a roar of laughter from the carriage; the young men found her witticism highly amusing but Louiset peered at his mother uncomprehendingly through his pale eyes, surprised by all the noise they were making. But Labordette still couldn’t manage to get away: Rose Mignon was beckoning to him and gave him some instructions; he took down some figures in a notebook. Then it was Clarisse’s and Gaga’s turn; they called him over and asked him to change their bets; they’d heard something the crowd was saying and wanted to drop Valerio II and back Lusignan. Labordette blandly continued to make notes and finally succeeded in leaving. He disappeared between two grandstands on the other side of the track."

"Doucement, le comte Muffat était remonté jusqu’au boulevard. Il jeta un regard sur la chaussée, puis revint à petits pas, rasant les boutiques. Un air humide et chauffé mettait une vapeur lumineuse dans l’étroit couloir. Le long des dalles, mouillées par l’égouttement des parapluies, les pas sonnaient, continuellement, sans un bruit de voix. Des promeneurs, en le coudoyant à chaque tour, l’examinaient, la face muette, blêmie par le gaz. Alors, pour échapper à ces curiosités, le comte se planta devant une papeterie, où il contempla avec une attention profonde un étalage de presse-papiers, des boules de verre dans lesquelles flottaient des paysages et des fleurs.","Gently, Count Muffat had gone up to the boulevard. He glanced down the street, then walked back slowly, skimming the shops. A moist, warm air put a luminous vapor in the narrow corridor. Along the flagstones, dampened by the dripping of the umbrellas, footsteps sounded continuously, without the sound of a voice. Walkers, elbowing him at every turn, examined him, his face mute, pale with gas. So, to escape these curiosities, the Count planted himself in front of a paper mill, where he gazed with profound attention at a display of paperweights, glass balls in which floated landscapes and flowers.","Count Muffat had strolled leisurely as far as the Boulevard. He cast a glance on the pavement, then slowly retraced his footsteps, keeping close to the shops. A damp and warm air filled the narrow thoroughfare with a kind of luminous vapour. Along the flagstones, wet from the drippings of umbrellas, footsteps reverberated continuously, without the sound of a single voice. The passers-by, elbowing the count at each turn, gazed at his impassive face, rendered paler than usual by the glare of the gas. So, to escape from their curiosity, he went and stood in front of a stationer’s shop, where he inspected, apparently with profound attention, a display of glass paper-weights, containing coloured representations of landscapes and flowers.","Count Muffat had slowly returned as far as the boulevard. He glanced out at the roadway and then came sauntering back along the shopwindows. The damp and heated atmosphere filled the narrow passage with a slight luminous mist. Along the flagstones, which had been wet by the drip-drop of umbrellas, the footsteps of the crowd rang continually, but there was no sound of voices. Passers- by elbowed him at every turn and cast inquiring looks at his silent face, which the gaslight rendered pale. And to escape these curious manifestations the count posted himself in front of a stationer's, where with profound attention contemplated an array of paperweights in the form of glass bowls containing floating landscapes and flowers.","Count Muffat strolled up to the boulevard, glanced out into the street, and came slowly back, keeping close to the shopfronts.

He was being constantly elbowed by these silent, scurrying passers-by, who gazed in curiosity at this tight-lipped man whose face was livid in the light of the gas.

"Muffat finit par entrer. Mais il resta surpris, en trouvant le marquis de Chouard installé entre les deux toilettes, sur une chaise. Le marquis s’était retiré là. Il écartait les pieds, parce qu’un seau fuyait et laissait couler une mare blanchâtre. On le sentait à l’aise, connaissant les bons endroits, ragaillardi dans cet étouffement de baignoire, dans cette tranquille impudeur de la femme, que ce coin de malpropreté rendait naturelle et comme élargie.","Muffat ends up entering. But he was surprised to find the Marquis de Chouard seated between the two toilets, on a chair. The marquis had retired there. He was spreading his feet because a bucket was leaking and letting a whitish pool flow.

The marquis had retired there. He kept his feet wide apart because one of the pails leaked, making a big pool of soapy water on the floor. He appeared to be very much at his ease, evidently knowing the best places, and looking quite young again in that oppressive bath-room atmosphere, in the presence of that quiet feminine wantonness, which the unclean surroundings rendered the more natural and, so to say, excusable.","Muffat entered the room at last. But what was his surprise when he found the Marquis de Chouard snugly enscounced on a chair between the two dressing tables! The marquis had withdrawn thither some time ago. He was spreading his feet apart because a pail was leaking and letting a whitish flood spread over the floor. He was visibly much at his ease, as became a man who knew all the snug corners, and had grown quite merry in the close dressing room, where people might have been bathing, and amid those quietly immodest feminine surroundings which the uncleanness of the little place rendered at once natural and poignant.","Muffat finally went in and to his surprise saw the Marquis de Chouard installed on a chair between the two dressing-tables, where he’d taken refuge. He was keeping his feet apart to avoid a puddle of whitish liquid caused by a leaking pail.

"Alors, tranquillement, pour aller à la toilette, elle passa en pantalon 27 au milieu de ces messieurs, qui s’écartèrent. Elle avait les hanches très fortes, le pantalon ballonnait, pendant que, la poitrine en avant, elle saluait encore avec son fin sourire. Tout d’un coup, elle parut reconnaître le comte Muffat, et elle lui tendit la main, en amie. Puis, elle le gronda de n’être pas venu à son souper. Son Altesse daignait plaisanter Muffat, qui bégayait, frissonnant d’avoir tenu une seconde, dans sa main brûlante, cette petite main, fraîche des eaux de toilette. Le comte avait fortement dîné chez le prince, grand mangeur et beau buveur. Tous deux étaient même un peu gris. Mais ils se tenaient très bien. Muffat, pour cacher son trouble, ne trouva qu’une phrase sur la chaleur.","Then, calmly, to go to the toilet, she passed in trousers 27 in the middle of these gentlemen, who moved aside. She had very strong hips, the pants ballooned, while, chest forward, she still greeted with her thin smile. Suddenly she seemed to recognize Count Muffat, and she held out her hand to him as a friend. Then she scolded him for not coming to her supper. His Highness deigned to joke Muffat, who was stammering, shuddering at having held for a second, in his burning hand, this little hand, fresh from the toilet waters. The count had dined heavily with the prince, a great eater and a fine drinker. Both were even a little gray. But they behaved very well. Muffat, to hide his confusion, found only one sentence on heat.","Then, in order to get to her dressing-table, she quietly walked in her drawers through the midst of the gentlemen, who all made way for her. Around her substantial hips her drawers looked like a balloon, as, with chest expanded, she continued to greet her visitors with her sly smile. Suddenly she appeared to recognise Count Muffat, and she shook hands with him as a friend. Then she scolded him for not having come to her supper. His Highness deigned to chaff Muffat, who stuttered out an explanation, trembling at the idea of having held in his hot hand for a second those tiny fingers , that were as cool as the water they had just been washed in. The count had dined well at the prince’s, who was a great eater and a splendid drinker. They were both, in fact, slightly tipsy, although they did not show it. To hide his confusion Muffat was only able to make a remark about the heat.","Thereupon, in order to reach her dressing table, she walked very quietly and just as she was through the midst of the gentlemen, who made way for her to pass. She had strongly marked hips, which filled her drawers out roundly, while with swelling bosom she still continued bowing and smiling her delicate little smile. Suddenly she seemed to recognize Count Muffat, and she extended her hand to him as an old friend. Then she scolded him for not having come to her supper party. His Highness deigned to chaff Muffat about this, and the latter stammered and thrilled again at the thought that for one second he had held in his own feverish clasp a little fresh and perfumed hand. The count had dined excellently at the prince's, who, indeed, was a heroic eater and drinker. Both of them were even a little intoxicated, but they behaved very creditably. To hide the commotion within him Muffat could only remark about the heat.","They stepped aside, and calmly, still in her trousers, she walked through the group of men to her dressing-table. The trousers clung tightly to the curves of her broad, round hips, and as she thrust her breasts forward once again she gave her sly, welcoming smile. Suddenly she seemed to become aware of Count Muffat. With a friendly gesture she held out her hand and complained that he’d not come to her supper party. The prince playfully made fun of Muffat, who could only stammer a few words in reply, still quivering with emotion at the touch of her tiny hand, so cool and scented, on his own, which was burning. The count had dined very well with the prince, who was a great lover of wine and good food; they were both even a trifle tipsy, though their behaviour was irreproachable. To cover his confusion, the only thing Muffat could think of was to comment on the heat."

"Depuis un instant, la figure de la Faloise, en face, lui déplaisait. Il ricanait, il lançait des mots désagréables. La Faloise, dont la tête tournait, se remuait beaucoup, en se serrant contre Gaga.

"Cependant, dans son luxe, au milieu de cette cour, Nana s’ennuyait à crever. Elle avait des hommes pour toutes les minutes de la nuit, et de l’argent jusque dans les tiroirs de sa toilette, mêlé aux peignes et aux brosses ; mais ça ne la contentait plus, elle sentait comme un vide quelque part, un trou qui la faisait bâiller. Sa vie se traînait inoccupée, ramenant les mêmes heures monotones. Le lendemain n’existait pas, elle vivait en oiseau, sûre de manger, prête à coucher sur la première branche venue. Cette certitude qu’on la nourrirait, la laissait allongée la journée entière, sans un effort, endormie au fond de cette oisiveté et de cette soumission de couvent, comme enfermée dans son métier de fille. Ne sortant qu’en voiture, elle perdait l’usage de ses jambes. Elle retournait à des goûts de gamine, baisait Bijou du matin au soir, tuait le temps à des plaisirs bêtes, dans son unique attente de l’homme, qu’elle subissait d’un air de lassitude complaisante ; et, au milieu de cet abandon d’elle-même, elle ne gardait que le souci de sa beauté, un soin continuel de se visiter, de se laver, de se parfumer partout, avec l’orgueil de pouvoir se mettre nue, à chaque instant et devant n’importe qui, sans avoir à rougir.","However, in her luxury, in the middle of this yard, Nana was bored to death. She had men for every minute of the night, and money even in her toilet drawers, mixed with combs and brushes; but that no longer satisfied her, she felt like a void somewhere, a hole that made her yawn. His life dragged on unoccupied, bringing back the same monotonous hours. The next day did not exist, she lived like a bird, sure to eat, ready to sleep on the first branch that came. This certainty that she would be fed left her stretched out the whole day, without an effort, asleep in the depths of this idleness and this convent-like submission, as if locked up in her profession as a girl. Only going out by car, she lost the use of her legs. She returned to the tastes of a girl, kissed Bijou from morning till night, killed time in stupid pleasures, in her sole expectation of the man, to which she submitted with an air of complacent weariness; and, in the midst of this abandonment of herself, she retained only concern for her beauty, a continual care to visit herself, to wash herself, to perfume herself everywhere, with the pride of being able to get naked, to every moment and in front of anyone, without having to blush.","Yet, in the midst of her luxury, in the midst of that court, Nana was bored to death. She had men with her every minute of the night, and money everywhere, even in the drawers of her dressing-table amongst her combs and brushes; but that no longer satisfied her, she felt a void somewhere, a vacancy that made her yawn. Her life rolled on unoccupied, bringing each day the same monotonous hours. The morrow did not exist for her. She lived like a bird, sure of eating, ready to sleep on the first branch she came across. This certainty of being fed left her stretched out the whole day, without an effort, asleep in the midst of that idleness and that convent-like submission, as though quite hemmed in in her profession of courtesan. Going out only in a carriage, she began to lose the use of her legs. She returned to the amusements of her childhood, kissing Bijou from morning to night, killing time with the silliest pleasures in her unique expectation of the man whom she put up with in a complaisant and weary sort of way; and, in the midst of this abandonment of herself, the only anxiety she had was for her beauty. She was continually examining, washing, and perfuming herself all over, with the pride of being able to appear naked before anyone and at any moment, without feeling ashamed.","Nevertheless, despite her luxurious life and her group of courtiers, Nana was nearly bored to death. She had men for every minute of the night, and money overflowed even among the brushes and combs in the drawers of her dressing table. But all this had ceased to satisfy her; she felt that there was a void somewhere or other, an empty place provocative of yawns. Her life dragged on, devoid of occupation, and successive days only brought back the same monotonous hours. Tomorrow had ceased to be; she lived like a bird: sure of her food and ready to perch and roost on any branch which she came to. This certainty of food and drink left her lolling effortless for whole days, lulled her to sleep in conventual idleness and submission as though she were the prisoner of her trade. Never going out except to drive, she was losing her walking powers. She reverted to low childish tastes, would kiss Bijou from morning to night and kill time with stupid pleasures while waiting for the man whose caresses she tolerated with an appearance of complaisant lassitude. Amid this species of self-abandonment she now took no thought about anything save her personal beauty; her sole care was to look after herself, to wash and to perfume her limbs, as became one who was proud of being able to undress at any moment and in face of anybody without having to blush for her imperfections.","But in spite of being surrounded by her admirers and in spite of all her luxury, Nana was bored to death. She had men to fill every minute of her nights and money even tucked away with her brushes and combs in the drawers of her dressingtable, but still she wasn’t satisfied. She felt a vacuum, a hole in her life which left her yawning. In her idle existence, time dragged on monotonously, hour after hour. She lived like a bird, with no thought of the morrow, sure of being fed and all ready to perch for the night on the most convenient branch. Safe in the knowledge of where her next meal was coming from, she loafed about all day and every day, listless and lethargic, a drowsy, acquiescent victim of her profession of tart, as cloistered as in a convent. As she always took a carriage, she was losing the use of her legs. She reverted to the ways of her childhood, kissing Bijou from morning to night, killing time in stupid pursuits, with only one thing to look forward to: some man whom she wearily submitted to, in order to oblige. In her shiftless life she retained only one concern: the care of her body, washing and scenting it all over, taking pride in being able to strip naked at all times before all and sundry without any need to blush."

Il n’éprouvait plus aucun malaise. Cela finissait par l’amuser lui-même, d’expliquer, selon l’expression convenable, « comment il l’avait perdu ». Il choisissait seulement les mots, par un reste de honte. La jeune femme, lancée, l’interrogea sur la comtesse.

"Tout le monde le couvrit de caresses. Bosc, embêté, parlait de se mettre à table ; il n’y avait que ça de sérieux. Nana demanda la permission d’asseoir Louiset près d’elle. Le dîner fut très gai. Bosc, pourtant, souffrit du voisinage de l’enfant, contre lequel il devait défendre son assiette. Madame Lerat le gêna aussi. Elle s’atten-drissait, lui communiquait tout bas des choses mystérieuses, des histoires de messieurs très bien qui la poursuivaient encore ; et, à deux reprises, il dut écarter son genou, car elle l’envahissait, avec des yeux noyés. Prullière se conduisit comme un malhonnête à l’égard de madame Maloir, qu’il ne servit pas une fois. Il était occupé uniquement de Nana, l’air vexé de la voir avec Fontan. D’ailleurs, les tourtereaux finissaient par être ennuyeux, tant ils s’embrassaient. Contre toutes les règles, ils avaient voulu se placer l’un près de l’autre.","Everyone showered him with hugs. Bosc, annoyed, talked about sitting down to table; that was all serious. Nana asked permission to sit Louiset beside her. The dinner was very cheerful. Bosc, however, suffered from being near the child, against whom he had to defend his plate. Madame Lerat bothered him too. She softened, communicated to him in a low voice mysterious things, stories of very nice gentlemen who still pursued her; and twice he had to part his knee, for she was encroaching on him, with watery eyes. Prullière behaved dishonestly towards Madame Maloir, whom he did not serve once. He was only occupied with Nana, looking annoyed to see her with Fontan. Besides, the lovebirds ended up being boring, so much they kissed. Against all the rules, they had wanted to be close to each other.","Everyone caressed and fondled him. Bosc, taking no real interest in the matter, moved that they should go to dinner —that was the only thing worth living for. Nana asked to be allowed to have little Louis beside her. The meal was a very merry one. Bosc, however, did not get on very well on account of the child’s proximity to him, and his time was taken up in defending his plate from the youngster’s attacks. Madame Lerat disturbed him also. She became very tender, and whispered in his ear most mysterious things—stories of gentlemen very well off who still followed her about, and on two separate occasions he was obliged to move his knee, for she kept pushing hers against it, looking at him most lovingly the while. Prullière behaved most shamefully to Madame Maloir, not helping her to a single thing. He was occupied solely with Nana, greatly annoyed at seeing her with Fontan. The turtle doves, too, were becoming a nuisance, kissing each other at every moment. In spite of all the usages, they had persisted in sitting side by side.","The company overwhelmed him with caresses, but Bosc was bored and talked of sitting down to table. That was the only serious business in life. Nana asked her guests' permission to put Louiset's chair next her own. The dinner was very merry, but Bosc suffered from the near neighborhood of the child, from whom he had to defend his plate. Mme Lerat bored him too. She was in a melting mood and kept whispering to him all sorts of mysterious things about gentlemen of the first fashion who were still running after Nana. Twice he had to push away her knee, for she was positively invading him in her gushing, tearful mood. Prulliere behaved with great incivility toward Mme Maloir and did not once help her to anything. He was entirely taken up with Nana and looked annoyed at seeing her with Fontan. Besides, the turtle doves were kissing so excessively as to be becoming positive bores. Contrary to all known rules, they had elected to sit side by side.","Everybody gushed over him. Fed up, Bosc suggested they might start eating; after all, that was the main thing in life. Nana asked to have Louiset next to her. The dinner was very lively, though Bosc was put out by having the boy beside him as he kept making raids on his plate. He was embarrassed by Madame Lerat too. She was becoming maudlin, whispering all sorts of cryptic remarks, telling him stories of well-to-do, respectable gentlemen who were still after her; and twice he had to move his knee away because she was encroaching on him with melting eyes. Prullière was behaving boorishly to Madame Maloir, never once bothering to pass her anything; he was concentrating his whole attention on Nana, peeved at seeing her with Fontan. Anyway, the little love-birds were becoming tedious; they couldn’t stop kissing each other. They’d broken all the rules by insisting on sitting beside each other."
"Alors, sans que Fauchery prît la peine de le questionner, il lui dit ce qu’il savait sur les Muffat. Au milieu de la conversation de ces dames, qui continuait devant la cheminée, tous deux baissaient la voix ; et l’on aurait cru, à les voir cravatés et gantés de blanc, qu’ils traitaient en phrases choisies quelque sujet grave. Donc, la maman Muffat, que la Faloise avait beaucoup connue, était une vieille insupportable, toujours dans les curés ; d’ailleurs, un grand air, un geste d’autorité qui pliait tout devant elle. Quant à Muffat, fils tardif d’un général créé comte par Napoléon Ier, il s’était naturellement trouvé en faveur après le 2 décembre17. Lui aussi manquait de gaieté ; mais il passait pour un très honnête homme, d’un esprit droit. Avec ça, des opinions de l’autre monde, et une si haute idée de sa charge à la cour, de ses dignités et de ses vertus, qu’il portait la tête comme un Saint-Sacrement18. C’était la maman Muffat qui lui avait donné cette belle éducation : tous les jours à confesse19, pas d’escapades, pas de jeunesse d’aucune sorte. Il pratiquait20, il avait des crises de foi d’une violence sanguine, pareilles à des accès de fièvre chaude. Enfin, pour le peindre d’un dernier détail, la Faloise lâcha un mot à l’oreille de son cousin.","So, without Fauchery taking the trouble to question him, he told him what he knew about the Muffats. In the midst of the ladies' conversation, which continued in front of the fireplace, both lowered their voices; and one would have thought, to see them in ties and white gloves, that they were discussing in chosen sentences some serious subject. So Maman Muffat, whom La Faloise had known a great deal, was an insufferable old woman, always with the priests; moreover, a grand air, a gesture of authority which bent everything before her. As for Muffat, late son of a general created count by Napoleon I, he naturally found himself in favor after 2 December17. He too lacked cheerfulness; but he passed for a very honest man, of an upright mind. With that, opinions from the other world, and such a lofty idea of his office at court, of his dignities and his virtues, that he wore his head like a Blessed Sacrament. It was Maman Muffat who had given him this fine education: every day at confession,19 no escapades, no youth of any kind. He practiced,20 he had crises of faith of bloody violence, like attacks of hot fever. Finally, to paint it in one last detail, La Faloise whispered a word in his cousin's ear.","Then, without Fauchery taking the trouble to question him further, he related all he knew respecting the Muffats. He spoke in a very low voice in the midst of the tittle-tattle of the ladies gathered round the fire; and one would have thought, seeing them in their white ties and gloves, that they were discussing some serious matter in the most select words. Mamma Muffat, whom La Faloise had known intimately, was an insupportable old woman, always mixed up with priests. As for Muffat, the tardy son of a general, made count by Napoleon I., he naturally found himself in favour after December 2nd.z He also was not very gay; but he was considered to be a very worthy and honest man. With that he possessed opinions belonging to another world, and had such a high idea of his post at court, of his dignities and of his virtues, that he carried his head like the holy sacrament. It was Mamma Muffat who had given him that beautiful education—confession every day, no youth, no sprees of any kind. He was most religious; he had frequent fits of faith of great violence, similar to attacks of brain fever. Then, to finish his portrait with a last detail, La Faloise whispered a word in his cousin’s ear.","Then although Fauchery did not take the trouble to question him, he told him all he knew about the Muffats. Amid the conversation of the ladies, which still continued in front of the hearth, they both spoke in subdued tones, and, seeing them there with their white cravats and gloves, one might have supposed them to be discussing in chosen phraseology some really serious topic. Old Mme Muffat then, whom La Faloise had been well acquainted with, was an insufferable old lady, always hand in glove with the priests. She had the grand manner, besides, and an authoritative way of comporting herself, which bent everybody to her will. As to Muffat, he was an old man's child; his father, a general, had been created count by Napoleon I, and naturally he had found himself in favor after the second of December. He hadn't much gaiety of manner either, but he passed for a very honest man of straightforward intentions and understanding. Add to these a code of old aristocratic ideas and such a lofty conception of his duties at court, of his dignities and of his virtues, that he behaved like a god on wheels. It was the Mamma Muffat who had given him this precious education with its daily visits to the confessional, its complete absence of escapades and of all that is meant by youth. He was a practicing Christian and had attacks of faith of such fiery violence that they might be likened to accesses of burning fever. Finally, in order to add a last touch to the picture, La Faloise whispered something in his cousin's ear.","Then, without further prompting, he told Fauchery what he knew about the Muffats. With the ladies’ conversation continuing in the background round the fire, they were both having to lower their voices, and in their white gloves and bow-ties they looked like two men engaged in an elegant discussion on some weighty topic. Well, old Ma Muffat, whom la Faloise had known well, was an impossible old trout, always stuck with priests; and incidentally, a very grand manner: one wave of her hand and you did as you were told. As for Muffat, he was the late-born son of a general whom Napoleon I had made a count and thus naturally persona grata after the coup of December the second. * He was a dull dog too; but he had the reputation of being a very honest and high-principled man. And his opinions were straight out of the Ark to match; he’d such an exalted idea of his duties at court, and of its dignity and virtues, that he carried his head as if it were a sacramental offering. It was old Ma Muffat who’d given him this marvellous upbringing: confession every day, no wild oats, no concessions to youth of any sort. He was a regular church-goer, and his crises of religious fervour were full-blooded, as painful as a raging fever. To complete the picture, la Faloise whispered a final detail into Fauchery’s ear."
"Elle s’était assise sur une chaise, contre le fourneau, les jambes coupées par sa course ; et, sans reprendre haleine, elle tira de son corsage une enveloppe dans laquelle se trouvaient quatre billets de cent francs. On voyait les billets par une large déchirure, qu’elle avait faite d’un doigt brutal, pour s’assurer du contenu. Les trois femmes, autour d’elle, regardaient fixement l’enveloppe, un gros papier froissé et sali, entre ses petites mains gantées. Il était trop tard, madame Lerat n’irait que le lendemain à Rambouillet. Nana entrait dans de grandes explications.","She was seated on a chair, against the stove, her legs cut off by her running; and, without taking breath, she drew from her bodice an envelope in which were four hundred-franc notes. The notes could be seen through a large tear, which she had made with a rough finger, to make sure of the contents. The three women around her were staring at the envelope, a large crumpled and soiled piece of paper, in her little gloved hands. It was too late, Madame Lerat would not go to Rambouillet until the next day. Nana went into great explanations.","She had seated herself in a chair close to the grate, her legs almost too tired to bear her, and, before she had even recovered her breath, she felt inside the body of her dress and drew forth an envelope, in which were four bank-notes of one hundred francs each. One could see the notes by a large tear she had made in the envelope with her finger so as to make sure of what it contained. The three women around her looked fixedly at the envelope of common paper, all crumpled and dirtied, in her little gloved hands. It was too late; Madame Lerat should not go to Rambouillet till the next day. Nana began to give her various instructions.","She had sat herself down on a chair close up against the stove, for her legs had failed her after so much running, and without stopping to take breath she drew from behind her stays an envelope in which there were four hundred-franc notes. They were visible through a large rent she had torn with savage fingers in order to be sure of the contents. The three women round about her stared fixedly at the envelope, a big, crumpled, dirty receptacle, as it lay clasped in her small gloved hands. It was too late now--Mme Lerat would not go to Rambouillet till tomorrow, and Nana entered into long explanations.","To rest her legs, she’d flopped down on a chair next to the stove and, still panting, pulled out of her bodice an envelope containing four hundred-franc notes, which could be seen through a large ragged slit she had torn with her finger to make sure they were all there. The three women round her were all staring at the envelope, a large, dirty bit of crumpled paper held in her dainty gloved hands. It was too late, Madame Lerat couldn’t go to Rambouillet until tomorrow. Nana started going into lengthy explanations."

"" Bordenave in the middle! He'll be our president!""","‘In the middle, opposite Nana!’ people were shouting. ‘Bordenave must be at the head of the table, put him in the middle!’"
"Mais un léger frémissement agita la salle. Rose Mignon venait d’entrer, en Diane39. Bien qu’elle n’eût ni la taille ni la figure du rôle, maigre et noire, d’une laideur adorable de gamin parisien, elle parut charmante, comme une raillerie même du personnage. Son air d’entrée, des paroles bêtes à pleurer où elle se plaignait de Mars 40 qui était en train de la lâcher pour Vénus, fut chanté avec une réserve pudique, si pleine de sous-entendus égrillards, que le public s’échauffa. Le mari et Steiner, coude à coude, riaient complaisamment41. Et toute la salle éclata, lorsque Prullière, cet acteur si aimé, se montra en général, un Mars de la Courtille42, empanaché d’un plumet géant, traînant un sabre qui lui arrivait à l’épaule. Lui, avait assez de Diane ; elle faisait trop sa poire. Alors, Diane jurait de le surveiller et de se venger. Le duo se terminait par une tyrolienne bouffonne, que Prullière enleva très drôlement, d’une voix de matou irrité. Il avait une fatuité 43 amusante de jeune premier en bonne fortune44, et roulait des yeux de bravache45, qui soulevaient des rires aigus de femme, dans les loges.","But a slight tremor shook the room. Rose Mignon had just entered, in Diane39. Although she had neither the height nor the figure for the role, thin and black, with the adorable ugliness of a Parisian urchin, she seemed charming, like a mockery even of the character. Her entrance aria, silly words to cry in which she complained about Mars 40 who was in the process of letting her go for Venus, was sung with a modest reserve, so full of cheeky innuendos, that the audience grew heated. The husband and Steiner, shoulder to shoulder, were laughing complacently. And the whole hall exploded when Prullière, that beloved actor, generally appeared, a Mars de la Courtille, plumed with a giant plume, dragging a saber which came to his shoulder. He had had enough of Diane; she was too pearish. So Diane swore to watch him and get revenge. The duet ended with a comical Tyrolean, which Prullière took off very funny, in the voice of an irritated tomcat. He had the amusing fatuity43 of a young premier in good fortune44, and rolled bravado45 eyes, which raised the shrill laughter of a woman in the boxes.","But a slight tremor took possession of the audience on the appearance of Rose Mignon as Diana. Although she had neither the face nor the figure for the part, as she was thin and dark, with the adorable ugliness of a Parisian urchin, she seemed charming, intended as she might have been as a mockery of the character she personated. Her entrance song, consisting of words stupid enough to send you to sleep, and in which she complained of Mars, who was neglecting her for Venus, was sung in a bashful manner, but so full of smutty inuendoes, that the audience warmed up. Her husband and Steiner laughed aloud as they sat side by side. And the whole house burst into applause when Prullière, that especial favourite, appeared as Mars in the uniform of a general, adorned with a monstrous plume, and dragging a sword that reached to his shoulder. He had had enough of Diana; she expected too much. So she swore to watch him and be revenged. Their duo wound up with a ludicrous tyrolienne,g which Prullière sang in his funniest style, and in the voice of an angry tabby. He possessed the amusing conceit of a young actor in high favour, and swaggered about as he rolled his eyes in a way that elicited the shrill laughter of the women in the boxes.","But a slight rustling movement ran through the house; Rose Mignon had just come on the stage as Diana. Now though she had neither the face nor the figure for the part, being thin and dark and of the adorable type of ugliness peculiar to a Parisian street child, she nonetheless appeared charming and as though she were a satire on the personage she represented. Her song at her entrance on the stage was full of lines quaint enough to make you cry with laughter and of complaints about Mars, who was getting ready to desert her for the companionship of Venus. She sang it with a chaste reserve so full of sprightly suggestiveness that the public warmed amain. The husband and Steiner, sitting side by side, were laughing complaisantly, and the whole house broke out in a roar when Prulliere, that great favorite, appeared as a general, a masquerade Mars, decked with an enormous plume and dragging along a sword, the hilt of which reached to his shoulder. As for him, he had had enough of Diana; she had been a great deal too coy with him, he averred. Thereupon Diana promised to keep a sharp eye on him and to be revenged. The duet ended with a comic yodel which Prulliere delivered very amusingly with the yell of an angry tomcat. He had about him all the entertaining fatuity of a young leading gentleman whose love affairs prosper, and he rolled around the most swaggering glances, which excited shrill feminine laughter in the boxes.","There was a fresh stir in the audience: Rose Mignon had just come on stage. She was Diana, and being dark and thin had neither the face nor the figure for the part, but her adorably impish ugliness, so essentially Parisian, was charming, a sort of parody of the character. The words of her first song, in which she complained that Mars was on the point of deserting her for Venus, were unbelievably silly, but she sang them with such coyness and so many saucy innuendoes that the public warmed to her. Her husband and Steiner, sitting cheek by jowl, were tactfully laughing. And the whole house exploded when the highly popular actor Prullière came on stage: he was Mars, a Mars straight out of pantomime, dressed up as a general with a giant plume on his helmet and wielding a sword which reached shoulder-high. He’d had his bellyful of Diana; she fancied herself too much. At this, Diana swore she’d keep a sharp eye on him and take her revenge. Their duet ended with a comic yodelling song which Prullière brought off hilariously, in a voice like a squawling tom-cat, with the asinine self-satisfaction of a juvenile lead conducting a torrid love affair, rolling swashbuckling eyes in a way which brought high-pitched laughter from the boxes."
"« Je te jure, chéri, je croyais que tu le savais. Sans cela, je n’aurais pas parlé, bien sûr... Puis, ce n’est pas vrai, peut-être. Moi, je n’affirme rien.

If I were a man, I wouldn't care about women! Women, you see, upstairs and downstairs, it's the same: all wedding parties and company. »","“I assure you, darling, I thought you knew of it. Otherwise, I would certainly not have spoken. Then, after all, perhaps it isn’t true. I’m not sure of anything. I merely heard it—people talk about it; but that proves nothing, does it?

Otherwise I shouldn't have spoken; you may be sure. But perhaps it isn't true. I don't say anything for certain. I've been told it, and people are talking about it, but what does that prove? Oh, get along! You're very silly to grow riled about it. If I were a man I shouldn't care a rush for the women! All the women are alike, you see, high or low; they're all rowdy and the rest of it.""","‘I thought you knew, I swear I did, darling. Of course, I wouldn’t have said anything otherwise … And anyway, it may not be true. I can’t say for sure, someone told me so and people are talking about it. But what does that prove?

Out for a good time, the whole lot of them!’"

Don't come in, you can see we can't come in. »",“Oh! how stupid it is to enter a room like that!” exclaimed Nana from her hiding-place. “Don’t come in; you see very well you cannot come in!”,"""Oh, it IS silly to come in that way!"" cried Nana from her hiding place.

"En effet, tous ces messieurs se retrouvaient.

She saw him very excited, happy nonetheless to meet him there, retaining a touch of tenderness for him, despite his dirtiness at not recognizing her, when he found himself with decent women.","Nana smiled, and placed her finger on her lips to make him hold his tongue. She saw that he was a bit on, but was happy all the same at meeting him, still keeping a little corner in her heart for him, in spite of his shabby behaviour in not recognizing her when he was in the company of ladies.","Nana smiled and laid a finger on her lips to beg him to be silent. She could see he was very much exalted, and yet she was glad to have met him, for she still felt tenderly toward him, and that despite the nasty way he had cut her when in the company of fashionable ladies.","Nana gave a smile, holding her finger to her lips to warn him to be quiet. Though he was obviously pretty tight, she was still glad to see him. True, he had played a dirty trick on her by refusing to recognize her when he’d been with those respectable ladies, but she still had a soft spot for him."
"Et elle se recoucha, souffla un mince jet de fumée, comme désintéressée et résolue à ne se mêler de rien. Non, c’était trop bête !","And she went back to bed, blowing out a thin jet of smoke, as if disinterested and resolved not to meddle in anything. No, that was too stupid!","And she laid herself down again, slowly puffing the smoke from her mouth, as though uninterested and determined not to mix herself up in anything. No, it was too absurd!","And she lay down again and blew forth a thin jet of smoke, as though she had no interest in present events and were resolved not to meddle in any of them. No, it was all too silly!",Then she flopped back on the divan and blew out a thin puff of smoke as if she’d lost interest and was determined to wash her hands of the whole business. It was all so stupid!
21. Comme si l’énervement lui-même n’avait été que du théâtre (voir plus loin : « ils tournèrent au drame »).,21. As if the nervousness itself had only been theater (see below: “they turned into drama”).,"It was a sudden and definitive start in a new career, a rapid rise in the celebrity of gallantry, in the full light of the follies of wealth and of the wasteful effronteries of beauty.",Look here!,…
"Elle parlait de madame Robert. Vandeuvres lui donna sa parole d’honneur que madame Robert avait refusé d’elle-même. Il écoutait et discutait sans rire, habitué à de pareilles scènes, sachant comment il fallait prendre les femmes, quand elles se trouvaient dans cet état. Mais, dès qu’il cherchait à lui saisir les mains, pour la lever de sa chaise et l’entraîner, elle se débattait, avec un redoublement de colère. Par exemple, on ne lui ferait jamais croire que Fauchery n’avait pas détourné le comte Muffat de venir. Un vrai serpent, ce Fauchery ; un envieux, un homme capable de s’acharner après une femme et de détruire son bonheur. Car, enfin elle le savait, le comte s’était pris d’un béguin pour elle. Elle aurait pu l’avoir.","She was talking about Madame Robert. Vandeuvres gave him his word of honor which Madame Robert had herself refused. He listened and discussed without laughing, accustomed to such scenes, knowing how to treat women when they found themselves in this state. But as soon as he tried to seize her hands, to raise her from her chair and drag her away, she struggled, with redoubled anger. For example, he would never be made to believe that Fauchery had not dissuaded Count Muffat from coming. A real snake, this Fauchery; an envious man, a man capable of going after a woman and destroying her happiness. Because, finally she knew it, the count had taken a crush on her. She could have had it.","She was speaking of Madame Robert. Vandeuvres assured her, on his word of honour, that Madame Robert had of her own free will declined the invitation. He listened and discussed without laughing, used to such scenes, and knowing how to deal with women when they were in that state; but the moment he tried to take hold of Nana’s hands, to raise her from her chair and lead her away, she struggled with increased fury. No one would ever make her believe, for instance, that Fauchery had not dissuaded Count Muffat from coming. He was a regular serpent, that Fauchery, a most envious fellow, a man who was capable of sticking to a woman until he had destroyed her happiness; for she knew very well the count had taken a fancy to her. She might have had him.","She referred to Mme Robert. Vandeuvres gave her his word of honor that Mme Robert had given a spontaneous refusal. He listened and he argued with much gravity, for he was well accustomed to similar scenes and knew how women in such a state ought to be treated. But the moment he tried to take hold of her hands in order to lift her up from her chair and draw her away with him she struggled free of his clasp, and her wrath redoubled. Now, just look at that! They would never get her to believe that Fauchery had not put the Count Muffat off coming! A regular snake was that Fauchery, an envious sort, a fellow capable of growing mad against a woman and of destroying her whole happiness. For she knew this--the count had become madly devoted to her! She could have had him!","The ‘nice respectable woman’ was Madame Robert. Vandeuvres gave his word that Madame Robert had refused of her own accord. He was accustomed to such scenes, and was listening to her and arguing without laughing; he knew how to deal with women when they were in that sort of state. But as soon as he tried to catch hold of her hands to pull her up and drag her out of the room, she struggled and became even angrier. And nobody would ever convince her, for example, that Fauchery hadn’t persuaded Count Muffat not to come. Fauchery was a real snake in the grass, an envious bastard who would stop at nothing to pursue a woman and wreck her happiness. She knew very well that the count had fallen for her. She could have had him."

Long flakes of greyish vapour passed slowly away, whilst patches of dark blue sky gradually showed larger and larger from one end of the horizon to the other. And in the bursts of sunshine which kept appearing through the breaks in the clouds, everything sparkled abruptly— the green turf, which was little by little being covered by a crowd of vehicles, and of persons on horseback and on foot; the course still free, with the judge’s stand, the winning-post, and the starting-place; then opposite, in the middle of the enclosure, the five symmetrical stands, with their storeys of brick and wood.","CHAPTER XI One Sunday the race for the Grand Prix de Paris was being run in the Bois de Boulogne beneath skies rendered sultry by the first heats of June.

"Mais elle ne put continuer. D’un mouvement terrible, il l’avait jetée par terre, de toute sa longueur ; et, levant le talon, il voulait lui écraser la tête pour la faire taire. Un instant, elle eut une peur affreuse. Aveuglé, comme fou, il s’était mis à battre24 la chambre. Alors, le silence étranglé qu’il gardait, la lutte dont il était secoué, la touchèrent jusqu’aux larmes. Elle éprouvait un regret mortel. Et, se pelotonnant devant le feu pour se cuire le côté droit, elle entreprit de le consoler.","But she couldn't go on.

Making a terrifying lunge at her, Muffat flung her flat on to the floor and lifted his foot, ready to smash her head under his heel to make her keep quiet. For a second she was panic-stricken.

"Satin, toute rouge, tirant la langue, alla dans le cabinet de toilette dont la porte grande ouverte laissait voir la pâleur des marbres, éclairée par la lumière laiteuse d’un globe dépoli, où brûlait une flamme de gaz. Alors, Nana causa avec les quatre hommes, en maîtresse de maison pleine de charme. Elle avait lu dans la journée un roman qui faisait grand bruit, l’histoire d’une fille46 ; et elle se révoltait, elle disait que tout cela était faux, témoignant d’ailleurs une répugnance indignée contre cette littérature immonde, dont la prétention était de rendre la nature47 ; comme si l’on pouvait tout montrer ! comme si un roman ne devait pas être écrit pour passer une heure agréable ! En matière de livres et de drames, Nana avait des opinions très arrêtées : elle voulait des œuvres tendres et nobles, des choses pour la faire rêver et lui grandir l’âme. Puis, la conversation étant tombée sur les troubles qui agitaient Paris, des articles incendiaires, des commencements d’émeute à la suite d’appels aux armes, lancés chaque soir dans les réunions publiques, elle s’emporta contre les républicains48. Que voulaient-ils donc, ces sales gens qui ne se lavaient jamais ? Est-ce qu’on n’était pas heureux, est-ce que l’empereur n’avait pas tout fait pour le peuple ? Une jolie ordure, le peuple ! Elle le connaissait, elle pouvait en parler ; et, oubliant le respect qu’elle venait d’exiger à table pour son petit monde de la rue de la Goutte-d’Or, elle tapait sur les siens avec des dégoûts et des peurs de femme arrivée. L'après-midi, justement, elle avait lu dans Le Figaro le compte rendu d'une séance de réunion publique, poussée au comique, dont elle riait encore, à cause des mots d’argot et de la sale tête d’un pochard qui s’était fait expulser.","Satin, very flushed, sticking out her tongue, went into the dressing room, the door of which was wide open, revealing the pallor of the marble, lit by the milky light of a frosted globe, in which a gas flame was burning. So Nana chatted with the four men, like a charming hostess. She had read a novel that caused a stir that day, the story of a girl; and she revolted, she said that all that was false, showing moreover an indignant repugnance against this filthy literature, whose claim was to render nature; as if we could show everything! as if a novel should not be written to pass a pleasant hour! When it comes to books and dramas, Nana had very firm opinions: she wanted tender and noble works, things to make her dream and grow her soul. Then, the conversation having fallen on the disturbances which agitated Paris, the incendiary articles, the beginnings of a riot following calls to arms, launched each evening in public meetings, it became angry with the Republicans. What did they want, these filthy people who never washed? Weren't we happy, hadn't the Emperor done everything for the people? Pretty scum, people! She knew him, she could talk about him; and, forgetting the respect she had just demanded at table for her little world in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, she beat on hers with the disgust and fear of an arrived woman. That afternoon, precisely, she had read in Le Figaro the report of a public meeting, pushed to the comic, which she still laughed at, because of the slang words and the dirty head of a drunk. who had been expelled.","Satin, very red in the face, and putting out her tongue, went into the dressing-room, the open door of which showed the pale marble lighted up by the subdued flame of a gas-jet enclosed in a ground-glass globe. Then Nana conversed with the four men, with the charm pertaining to the mistress of a household. She had been reading during the day a novel that had created a great sensation—the history of a courtesan; and she was disgusted. She said that it was all false, showing, besides, an indignant repugnance for such filthy literature, which had the pretension of being true to nature, as though one could describe everything, as though a novel ought not to be written just to while away a pleasant hour! Regarding books and plays, Nana had very fixed opinions. She wished for noble and tender works—things to set her thinking and to elevate her soul. Then the conversation having turned on the troubles that were agitating Paris—on the incendiary newspaper articles, the attempts at riot following the calls to arms enunciated every night at public meetings—she vented her wrath on the Republicans. Whatever did they want, those dirty fellows who never washed themselves? Wasn’t every one happy? Hadn’t the Emperor done everything for the people? A lot of swine, these people! She knew them—she could speak of them; and forgetting the respect she had just exacted at the dinner-table for her little world of the Rue de la Goutte d’Or , she assailed her relations and friends of bygone days with all the disgust and the horror of a woman arrived at the top of the tree. It so happened that very afternoon she had read in the “Figaro” the report of a public meeting written in a most comical style, and the recollection of which still made her laugh, on account of the slang words used, and the description of a disgusting drunkard who had been turned out.","Satin, blushing all over and putting out her tongue, went into the dressing room, through the widely open door of which you caught a glimpse of pale marbles gleaming in the milky light of a gas flame in a globe of rough glass. After that Nana talked to the four men as charmingly as hostess could. During the day she had read a novel which was at that time making a good deal of noise. It was the history of a courtesan, and Nana was very indignant, declaring the whole thing to be untrue and expressing angry dislike to that kind of monstrous literature which pretends to paint from nature. "" Just as though one could describe everything,"" she said. Just as though a novel ought not to be written so that the reader may while away an hour pleasantly! In the matter of books and of plays Nana had very decided opinions: she wanted tender and noble productions, things that would set her dreaming and would elevate her soul. Then allusion being made in the course of conversation to the troubles agitating Paris, the incendiary articles in the papers, the incipient popular disturbances which followed the calls to arms nightly raised at public meetings, she waxed wroth with the Republicans. What on earth did those dirty people who never washed really want? Were folks not happy? Had not the emperor done everything for the people? A nice filthy lot of people! She knew 'em; she could talk about 'em, and, quite forgetting the respect which at dinner she had just been insisting should be paid to her humble circle in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, she began blackguarding her own class with all the terror and disgust peculiar to a woman who had risen successfully above it. That very afternoon she had read in the Figaro an account of the proceedings at a public meeting which had verged on the comic. Owing to the slang words that had been used and to the piggish behavior of a drunken man who had got himself chucked, she was laughing at those proceedings still.","Satin went quite red, stuck out her tongue, and flounced off into the dressing-room, through the wide-open door of which large areas of pale marble could be seen gleaming in the milky light of the frosted gas-lamp globes. Nana now became the charming hostess and chatted to the four men. During the day she’d read a novel that was arousing a great deal of discussion, the story of a tart; and she was saying that it was appalling and quite untrue; she also expressed her indignation and revulsion at that sort of filth that claimed to give a true picture of life. As if you could put everything into a book, as if a novel should be written for any reason but a reader’s entertainment! Nana held very firm views on books and drama: novels should be full of sentiment and high principles, uplifting, something to make you dream! From here, the conversation turned to the current unrest in Paris, inflammatory articles, public meetings calling for violence, incitement to outbreaks of rioting every night. She spoke angrily of the Republicans. What did they think they were up to, those great unwashed? Weren’t people all happy, hadn’t the Emperor done everything possible for the lower classes? What scum they were! And forgetting how, earlier on, she’d been demanding respect for her little world of the Rue de la Goutte d’Or, she roundly condemned them, her own people, showing the disgust and fear of a woman who’s made it to the top herself. That very afternoon, in fact, she’d read in the Figaro the report of a public meeting, a caricature of a meeting which was still making her laugh because of their slangy language and the ugly mug of the boozer who’d been kicked out."
"Et il but d’un trait. Le comte Muffat et le marquis de Chouard l’avaient imité. On ne plaisantait plus, on était à la cour. Ce monde du théâtre prolongeait le monde réel, dans une farce grave, sous la buée ardente du gaz. Nana, oubliant qu’elle était en pantalon, avec son bout de chemise, jouait la grande dame, la reine Vénus, ouvrant ses petits appartements 29 aux personnages de l’État. À chaque phrase, elle lâchait les mots d’Altesse Royale, elle faisait des révérences convaincues, traitait ses chienlits 30 de Bosc et de Prullière en souverain que son ministre accompagne. Et personne ne souriait de cet étrange mélange, de ce vrai prince, héritier d’un trône, qui buvait le champagne d’un cabotin, très à l’aise dans ce carnaval des dieux31, dans cette mascarade de la royauté, au milieu d’un peuple d’habilleuses et de filles, de rouleurs de planches et de montreurs de femmes. Bordenave, enlevé par cette mise en scène, songeait aux recettes qu’il ferait, si Son Altesse avait consenti à paraître comme ça, au second acte de La Blonde Vénus.","And he drank in one gulp. Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard had imitated him. We were no longer joking, we were at court. This world of the theater extended the real world, in a serious farce, under the burning vapor of the gas. Nana, forgetting that she was in trousers, with the end of her shirt, played the great lady, Queen Venus, opening her little apartments 29 to the personages of the State. With each sentence, she dropped the words of Royal Highness, she made convinced bows, treated her petty dogs, de Bosc and de Prullière, as a sovereign accompanied by her minister. And no one smiled at this strange mixture, at this true prince, heir to a throne, who drank the champagne of a comedian, very much at ease in this carnival of the gods,31 in this masquerade of royalty, in the midst of 'a people of dressers and girls, of plank-rollers and women-showers. Bordenave, carried away by this staging, thought of the receipts he would make if His Highness had consented to appear like that, in the second act of La Blonde Vénus.","And he swallowed the wine at a draught. Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard had done the same. There was no more jesting now, they were all at court. This theatrical world was making them forget the real one, with a serious farce performed beneath the hot glare of the gas. Nana, forgetting that she was in her drawers and displaying the tail of her chemise, acted the grand lady, Queen Venus, opening her private apartments to the great personages of the state. To every sentence she uttered she added the words “royal highness,” which she accompanied with curtsies, and she treated those masqueraders, Bosc and Prullière, in the style of a queen accompanied by her prime minister. And no one smiled at the strange mixture, of a real prince, heir to a throne, who was drinking a stroller’s champagne, quite at his ease in this carnival of the gods, in this masquerade of royalty, in the midst of a crowd composed of dressers and strumpets, players and exhibitors of women. Bordenave, carried away by the scene, was thinking of the money he would make if His Highness would only consent to appear like that in the second act of the “Blonde Venus.”","Then he drank it off. Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard had followed his example. There was no more jesting now--the company were at court. Actual life was prolonged in the life of the theater, and a sort of solemn farce was enacted under the hot flare of the gas. Nana, quite forgetting that she was in her drawers and that a corner of her shift stuck out behind, became the great lady, the queen of love, in act to open her most private palace chambers to state dignitaries. In every sentence she used the words ""Royal Highness"" and, bowing with the utmost conviction, treated the masqueraders, Bosc and Prulliere, as if the one were a sovereign and the other his attendant minister. And no one dreamed of smiling at this strange contrast, this real prince, this heir to a throne, drinking a petty actor's champagne and taking his ease amid a carnival of gods, a masquerade of royalty, in the society of dressers and courtesans, shabby players and showmen of venal beauty. Bordenave was simply ravished by the dramatic aspects of the scene and began dreaming of the receipts which would have accrued had His Highness only consented thus to appear in the second act of the Blonde Venus.","He downed it in a gulp. Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard followed suit. It was no longer just a joke; they were courtiers. In the hazy heat of the gas-jets, this world of the theatre was continuing the real world in a solemn farce. Forgetting that she was in trousers with her shift showing, Nana was acting the great lady, Queen Venus opening up her private apartments to persons of note in her state. Every one of her sentences contained a ‘Royal Highness’, she was curtseying enthusiastically, and treating the old rogues Bosc and Prullière like a sovereign attended by her ministers. And nobody was smiling at this strange mixture, this real prince, heir to a crown, who was drinking champagne as a guest of a second-rate actor, completely at ease in this celestial carnival, this royal masquerade, surrounded by a vulgar entourage of dressers, tarts, stage hacks, showmen, and exhibitors of women. Excited by such a setting and such a cast, Bordenave was reflecting on what his box-office takings would be if His Highness agreed to appear like that in the second act of The Blonde Venus."

"Le comte s’était assis de l’air cérémonieux d’un voisin de campagne en visite. Ses mains seules avaient un tremblement. Dans cette nature sanguine8, restée vierge, le désir, fouetté par la savante tactique de Nana, déterminait à la longue de terribles ravages. Cet homme si grave, ce chambellan qui traversait d’un pas digne les salons des Tuileries, mordait la nuit son traversin et sanglotait, exaspéré, évoquant toujours la même image sensuelle. Mais, cette fois, il était résolu d’en finir. Le long de la route, dans la grande paix du crépuscule, il avait rêvé des brutalités. Et, tout de suite, après les premières paroles, il voulut saisir Nana, à deux mains.","The Count sat down with the ceremonial air of a visiting country neighbor. His hands alone shook. In this bloodthirsty nature8, which had remained virgin, desire, whipped up by Nana's skilful tactics, determined in the long run terrible ravages. This grave man, this chamberlain who walked with a dignified step through the salons of the Tuileries, bit his bolster at night and sobbed, exasperated, always evoking the same sensual image. But this time he was determined to get it over with. Along the road, in the great peace of the twilight, he had dreamed of the brutalities. And immediately, after the first words, he wanted to grab Nana with both hands.","The count had seated himself in the ceremonious way of a country neighbour making a call. His hands alone trembled slightly. In his sanguineous constitution, still in a state of virginity, inordinate desire, scourged by Nana’s skilful tactics, was at length producing frightful ravages. That grave-looking man, that chamberlain who traversed with such a dignified step the gilded saloons of the Tuileries, would, at night-time, bite the bolster on his bed and sob aloud, carried away by his exasperation, and ever invoking the same sensual vision. But this time he was determined to end his suffering. Along the road, in the peaceful twilight, he had thought of gratifying his passion by force; and directly they had exchanged a few words, he tried to take Nana in his arms.","The count had seated himself with all the ceremonious politeness becoming a country caller. Only his hands were trembling slightly. Lust, which Nana's skillful tactics daily exasperated, had at last wrought terrible havoc in that sanguine, uncontaminated nature. The grave man, the chamberlain who was wont to tread the state apartments at the Tuileries with slow and dignified step, was now nightly driven to plunge his teeth into his bolster, while with sobs of exasperation he pictured to himself a sensual shape which never changed. But this time he was determined to make an end of the torture. Coming along the highroad in the deep quiet of the gloaming, he had meditated a fierce course of action. And the moment he had finished his opening remarks he tried to take hold of Nana with both hands.","The count had sat down, like a man making a polite, neighbourly call. Only his hands were trembling. Nana’s skilful tactics of breathing hot and cold were finally proving devastating for this chaste, full-blooded man; the dignified chamberlain who would walk solemnly through the staterooms of the Tuileries Palace during the day, at night would sob and chew his pillow in wild frustration, obsessed by one single erotic vision. This time, however, he was determined to put an end to all that. On his way here, in the deep peace of twilight, he had toyed with thoughts of violence, and after the first few words he attempted to seize hold of Nana with both hands."
"À cette heure, Nana, très tourmentée, n’était guère à la rigolade. Il lui fallait de l’argent. Quand la Tricon n’avait pas besoin d’elle, ce qui arrivait trop souvent, elle ne savait où donner de son corps60. Alors, c’était avec Satin des sorties enragées sur le pavé de Paris, dans ce vice d’en bas qui rôde le long des ruelles boueuses, sous la clarté trouble du gaz. Nana retourna dans les bastringues de barrière61, où elle avait fait sauter ses premiers jupons sales ; elle revit les coins noirs des boulevards extérieurs, les bornes sur lesquelles des hommes, à quinze ans, l’embrassaient, lorsque son père la cherchait pour lui enlever le derrière62. Toutes deux couraient, faisaient les bals et les cafés d’un quartier, grimpant des escaliers humides de crachats et de bière renversée ; ou bien elles marchaient doucement, elles remontaient les rues, se plantaient debout, contre les portes cochères. Satin, qui avait débuté au Quartier latin, conduisit Nana à Bullier 63 et dans les brasseries du boulevard Saint-Michel. Mais les vacances arrivaient, le quartier sentait trop la dèche. Et elles revenaient toujours aux grands boulevards. C’était encore là qu’elles avaient le plus de chance. Des hauteurs de Montmartre au plateau de l'Observatoire64, elles battaient ainsi la ville entière. Soirées de pluie où les bottines s’éculaient, soirées chaudes qui collaient les corsages sur la peau, longues factions, promenades sans fin, bousculades et querelles, brutalités dernières d’un passant emmené dans quelque garni borgne et redescendant les marches grasses avec des jurons.","At this hour, Nana, very tormented, was hardly joking. He needed money. When the Tricon didn't need her, which happened too often, she didn't know where to give with her body. So, it was with Satin rabid outings on the pavement of Paris, in this vice of the bottom which prowls along the muddy alleys, under the cloudy light of the gas. Nana went back to the fence bars61, where she had blown off her first dirty petticoats; she saw again the dark corners of the outer boulevards, the bollards on which men, at fifteen, kissed her, when her father was looking for her to remove her behind. Both of them ran, went to balls and cafes in a neighborhood, climbing stairs wet with spit and spilled beer; or else they walked slowly, they went up the streets, planted themselves upright, against the carriage entrances. Satin, who had started out in the Latin Quarter, took Nana to Bullier 63 and to the brasseries on Boulevard Saint-Michel. But the holidays were coming, the neighborhood smelt too much of waste. And they always came back to the big boulevards. It was still there that they had the best luck. From the heights of Montmartre to the plateau of the Observatory64, they beat the entire city. Rainy evenings when the boots wore off, hot evenings which stuck the bodices to the skin, long shifts, endless walks, jostling and quarrels, the last brutalities of a passer-by led into some one-eyed barn and coming down the greasy steps with oaths .","At that time Nana was very worried, and was not much inclined for a spree. She was greatly in want of money. When old Tricon had nothing for her, and that occurred only too often, she did not know whom to go to. Then she would wander about with Satin all over Paris, amidst that degrading vice which prowls along the muddy by-streets, beneath the dim glimmer of the gas lamps. Nana returned to the low dancing places of the barriers, where she had first learned to hop about with her dirty skirts. She once more beheld the dark corners of the outer Boulevards, the posts against which men used to kiss her when only fifteen years old, whilst her father was seeking her to give her a hiding. They both hastened along, visiting all the balls and the cafés of a locality, crawling up stairs wet with saliva and spilt beer; or else they walked slowly, following street after street, and standing up every now and then in the doorways. Satin, who had first appeared in the Quartier Latin, took Nana there, to Bullier’s, and to the cafés of the Boulevard Saint-Michel. But it was vacation time, and the quarter was almost deserted; so they returned to the principal Boulevards. It was there that they met with most luck. From the heights of Montmartre to the plateau where the Observatory was situated, they thus rambled about the entire city. Rainy nights when their shoes would become trodden down at heel, warm nights which made their clothes adhere to their skin, long waits and endless wanderings, jostlings and quarrels, brutal abuse from a passer-by enticed into some obscure lodging, down the dirty stairs of which he retired swearing.","At that time Nana was much tormented by circumstances and not at all festively inclined. She needed money, and when the Tricon did not want her, which too often happened, she had no notion where to bestow her charms. Then began a series of wild descents upon the Parisian pavement, plunges into the baser sort of vice, whose votaries prowl in muddy bystreets under the restless flicker of gas lamps. Nana went back to the public-house balls in the suburbs, where she had kicked up her heels in the early ill-shod days. She revisited the dark corners on the outer boulevards, where when she was fifteen years old men used to hug her while her father was looking for her in order to give her a hiding. Both the women would speed along, visiting all the ballrooms and restaurants in a quarter and climbing innumerable staircases which were wet with spittle and spilled beer, or they would stroll quietly about, going up streets and planting themselves in front of carriage gates. Satin, who had served her apprenticeship in the Quartier Latin, used to take Nana to Bullier's and the public houses in the Boulevard Saint-Michel. But the vacations were drawing on, and the Quarter looked too starved. Eventually they always returned to the principal boulevards, for it was there they ran the best chance of getting what they wanted. From the heights of Montmartre to the observatory plateau they scoured the whole town in the way we have been describing. They were out on rainy evenings, when their boots got worn down, and on hot evenings, when their linen clung to their skins. There were long periods of waiting and endless periods of walking; there were jostlings and disputes and the nameless, brutal caresses of the stray passer-by who was taken by them to some miserable furnished room and came swearing down the greasy stairs afterward.","For the moment, Nana was far too worried and distressed to be in the mood for fun of any sort; what she needed was money. When Tricon couldn’t use her, which was all too often, Nana was at a loss what to do with her body. When this happened she’d launch out with Satin into wild expeditions on the Paris streets, lurking in muddy little back-streets, offering sex on the cheap. She went back to the sleazy dance-halls on the outskirts of Paris where she’d hopped around in her grubby petticoats in earlier days; she hung around the dark corners of the boulevards in the outer suburbs and the stone posts she’d sat on when she was 15, being kissed by men while her father was trying to find her to tan her backside. The pair of them would hustle around, trying out the dancehalls and cafés of a district, climbing up stairs wet with spittle and spilt beer; or else saunter up streets to take up their post in carriage gateways. Satin had started her career in the Latin Quarter and took Nana down there to Bullier * and the brasseries of the Boulevard Saint-Michel. But the holidays were due to start and the area had a strong smell of lack of cash. They’d always find their way back to the main boulevards, as still offering them the best chance. In this way, they combed the whole city, from the heights of Montmartre to the plain of the Observatoire, on rainy nights in their down-at-heel bootees, on warm nights when their bodices clung to their skin, hanging around for hours or walking endlessly, jostled and covered in abuse, the parting obscenities of some man picked up on the street and taken to a squalid hotel, as he goes off swearing down the slimy stairs."

"Cependant, Mignon venait d’entraîner Steiner au café des Variétés. Voyant le succès de Nana, il s’était mis à parler d’elle avec enthousiasme, tout en surveillant le banquier du coin de l’œil. Il le connaissait, deux fois il l’avait aidé à tromper Rose, puis, le caprice passé, l’avait ramené, repentant et fidèle96.

In the café, too many consumers crowded round the marble tables; some drank standing up, hastily; and the large mirrors reflected this throng of heads to infinity, enlarged the narrow room beyond measure, with its three chandeliers, its moleskin banquettes, its winding staircase draped in red.

He did not mind about Steiner, but a child!","The latter in extreme agitation gazed after this illusive vision of Nana while his wife turned slowly round and scrutinized him. Then he cast his eyes on the ground as though to escape the sound of galloping hoofs which were sweeping away both his senses and his heart.

He was brokenhearted at the thought that she should have preferred a mere child to him!

He could have screamed out with pain. A child! He was shattered that she should have preferred a child to him. Steiner he could accept… but that little boy!"

"Et elle s’échappa. Le comte demeurait gêné devant son beau-père. Un flot de sang lui était monté à la face. Il n’avait pas éprouvé, dans la loge de Nana, au milieu de ce luxe de tentures et de glaces, l’âcre excitation de la misère honteuse de ce galetas57, plein de l’abandon des deux femmes. Cependant, le marquis venait de partir derrière Simonne très pressée, lui parlant dans le cou, pendant qu’elle refusait de la tête. Fauchery les suivait en riant. Alors, le comte se vit seul avec l’habilleuse, qui rinçait les cuvettes. Et il s’en alla, il descendit à son tour l’escalier, les jambes molles, levant58 de nouveau devant lui des femmes en jupons, faisant battre les portes sur son passage. Mais, au milieu de cette débandade de filles lâchées à travers les quatre étages, il n’aperçut distinctement qu’un chat, le gros chat rouge59, qui, dans cette fournaise empoisonnée de musc, filait le long des marches en se frottant le dos contre les barreaux de la rampe, la queue en l’air.","And she escaped. The count remained embarrassed in front of his father-in-law. A stream of blood rose to his face. He had not experienced, in Nana's box, amid this luxury of hangings and mirrors, the bitter excitement of the shameful misery of this garret, full of the abandonment of the two women. However, the marquis had just left behind Simonne in a great hurry, whispering into her neck, while she shook her head. Fauchery followed them laughing. Then the Count found himself alone with the dresser, who was rinsing the basins. And he went away, he went down the stairs in his turn, his legs limp, once again raising women in petticoats in front of him, knocking the doors in his path. But, in the midst of this stampede of girls let loose across the four floors, he distinctly saw only one cat, the big red cat59, which, in this poisonous furnace of musk, was darting along the steps, rubbing its back. against the bars of the banister, tail in the air.","And she hastened away. The count felt very uneasy in the presence of his father-in-law. He became very red in the face.

The marquis, however, had gone off after Simone, who seemed in a great hurry, whispering in her ear, whilst she kept shaking her head. Fauchery followed them laughing. Then the count found himself left alone with the dresser, who was rinsing out the basins. So he also went off and descended the staircase, his legs scarcely able to bear his weight, startling women in their petticoats, and causing doors to be hastily closed as he passed. But in the midst of this hurry-skurry of girls across the four storeys, the only thing he distinctly saw was a cat—the big tortoise-shell cat who, in that furnace poisoned with musk, crawled down the stairs rubbing its back against the rails of the balustrade, with its tail erect.","And with that she darted off, and the count remained much embarrassed in his father-in-law's presence. The blood had rushed to his face. In Nana's dressing room, amid all the luxury of hangings and mirrors, he had not experienced the sharp physical sensation which the shameful wretchedness of that sorry garret excited within him, redolent as it was of these two girls' self- abandonment. Meanwhile the marquis had hurried in the rear of Simonne, who was making off at the top of her pace, and he kept whispering in her ear while she shook her head in token of refusal. Fauchery followed them, laughing. And with that the count found himself alone with the dresser, who was washing out the basins. Accordingly he took his departure, too, his legs almost failing under him. Once more he put up flights of half-dressed women and caused doors to bang as he advanced. But amid the disorderly, disbanded troops of girls to be found on each of the four stories, he was only distinctly aware of a cat, a great tortoise-shell cat, which went gliding upstairs through the ovenlike place where the air was poisoned with musk, rubbing its back against the banisters and keeping its tail exceedingly erect.","She dashed away. The count went bright red, embarrassed by the presence of his father-in-law. In Nana’s dressing-room, with its luxurious draperies and mirrors, he hadn’t felt the sharp thrill of excitement he experienced amid the sluttish neglect of this sordid, poverty-stricken garret. Meanwhile the marquis had left the room in pursuit of Simonne, who was also rushing off; he was whispering in her ear while she kept shaking her head. Fauchery went after them, laughing. The count found himself alone with the dresser, who was rinsing out the wash-basins. He too left, trembling at the knees as he went down the stairs, once again flushing out women in petticoats and hearing doors slam as he went by. But amongst all these girls scrambling around on each of the four floors, the only thing he saw clearly was a cat, the fat ginger cat sliding away down the steps of this oven of a staircase which reeked of musk, rubbing its back against the banister rails with its tail erect."

"Le bal s’était encore animé. Un nouveau quadrille donnait au plancher du salon un léger balancement, comme si la vieille demeure eût fléchi sous le branle de la fête. Par moments, dans la pâleur brouillée des têtes, se détachait un visage de femme, emporté par la danse, aux yeux brillants, aux lèvres entrouvertes, avec le coup 21 du lustre sur la peau blanche. Madame Du Joncquoy déclarait qu’il n’y avait pas de bon sens. C’était une folie d’empiler cinq cents personnes dans un appartement où l’on aurait tenu deux cents à peine. Alors, pourquoi ne pas signer le contrat sur la place du Carrousel ? Effet des nouvelles mœurs, disait madame Chantereau ; jadis, de telles solennités se passaient en famille ; aujourd’hui, il fallait des cohues, la rue entrant librement, un écrasement sans lequel la soirée semblait froide. On affichait son luxe, on introduisait chez soi l’écume de Paris ; et rien de plus naturel si des promiscuités pareilles pourrissaient ensuite le foyer. Ces dames se plaignaient de ne pas reconnaître plus de cinquante personnes. D’où venait tout ça ? Des jeunes filles, décolletées, montraient leurs épaules. Une femme avait un poignard d’or planté dans son chignon, tandis qu’une broderie de perles de jais l’habillait d’une cotte de mailles. On en suivait une autre en souriant, tellement la hardiesse de ses jupes collantes22, semblait singulière. Tout le luxe de cette fin d’hiver était là, le monde du plaisir avec ses tolérances, ce qu’une maîtresse de maison ramasse parmi ses liaisons d’un jour, une société où se coudoyaient de grands noms et de grandes hontes, dans le même appétit de jouissances. La chaleur augmentait, le quadrille déroulait la symétrie cadencée de ses figures, au milieu des salons trop pleins.","The ball was still lively. A new quadrille gave the drawing-room floor a slight sway, as if the old dwelling had given way under the tremor of the festival. At times, in the blurred pallor of the heads, a woman's face stood out, carried away by the dance, with shining eyes, parted lips, with the touch of luster on the white skin. Madame Du Joncquoy declared that there was no common sense. It was madness to pile five hundred people into an apartment that could barely fit two hundred. So why not sign the contract on the Place du Carrousel? Effect of new manners, said Madame Chantereau; formerly, such solemnities took place in the family; today there had to be crowds, the street entering freely, a crushing without which the evening seemed cold. They flaunted their luxury, they introduced the scum of Paris into their homes; and nothing could be more natural if such promiscuity then rots the home. These ladies complained of not recognizing more than fifty people. Where did all this come from? Young girls, low-cut, showed their shoulders. A woman had a golden dagger stuck in her chignon, while an embroidery of jet beads dressed her in a coat of mail. We followed another, smiling, so strange did the boldness of her clinging skirts22 seem. All the luxury of this end of winter was there, the world of pleasure with its tolerances, what a mistress of the house picked up among her one-day affairs, a society where great names and great shame rubbed elbows, in the same appetite for enjoyment. The heat increased, the quadrille unrolled the rhythmic symmetry of its figures, in the middle of the overcrowded salons.","The ball had become more animated than ever. Another quadrille gave a kind of gentle swing to the floor of the drawing-room, as though the old house had staggered beneath the commotion of the merry-making. Now and again, in the mixed paleness of the faces, there stood out a woman’s countenance, carried away by the dance, with sparkling eyes and parted lips, and the full light of a chandelier shining on her white skin. Madame du Joncquoy declared that the count and countess must have been out of their senses. It was madness to squeeze five hundred people into a room that could scarcely hold two hundred. Why not have the contract signed on the Place du Carrousel at once? It was the result of new manners, Madame Chantereau said. In her younger days such solemnities took place in the bosom of one’s family; now one must have a mob, the whole street being freely allowed to enter. Unless one had such a crush, the entertainment would be considered quiet and uneventful. One advertised one’s luxury, one introduced into one’s abode the very scum of Paris; and there was nothing more natural if such promiscuousness ended by corrupting the home. The two ladies complained that they did not know more than fifty of the persons present. How was it so? Young girls in low-neck dresses displayed their bare shoulders; a woman wore a golden dagger stuck in her chignon, whilst the body of her dress, embroidered with jet black beads, looked like a coat of mail; another was being smilingly followed about, her skirts so tight fitting that they gave her a most singular appearance. All the luxury of the close of the winter season was there, the world of pleasure with its tolerations, all that which the mistress of a house picks from her acquaintances of a day, a society where great names and great infamies elbowed each other in the same appetite for pleasure. The heat was increasing, the quadrille unrolled the cadenced symmetry of its figures amidst the overcrowded rooms.","The ball had grown still more animated. A fresh quadrille was imparting a slight swaying motion to the drawing-room floor, as though the old dwelling had been shaken by the impulse of the dance. Now and again amid the wan confusion of heads a woman's face with shining eyes and parted lips stood sharply out as it was whirled away by the dance, the light of the lusters gleaming on the white skin. Mme du Joncquoy declared that the present proceedings were senseless. It was madness to crowd five hundred people into a room which would scarcely contain two hundred. In fact, why not sign the wedding contract on the Place du Carrousel? This was the outcome of the new code of manners, said Mme Chantereau. In old times these solemnities took place in the bosom of the family, but today one must have a mob of people; the whole street must be allowed to enter quite freely, and there must be a great crush, or else the evening seems a chilly affair. People now advertised their luxury and introduced the mere foam on the wave of Parisian society into their houses, and accordingly it was only too natural if illicit proceedings such as they had been discussing afterward polluted the hearth. The ladies complained that they could not recognize more than fifty people. Where did all this crowd spring from? Young girls with low necks were making a great display of their shoulders. A woman had a golden dagger stuck in her chignon, while a bodice thickly embroidered with jet beads clothed her in what looked like a coat of mail. People's eyes kept following another lady smilingly, so singularly marked were her clinging skirts. All the luxuriant splendor of the departing winter was there--the overtolerant world of pleasure, the scratch gathering a hostess can get together after a first introduction, the sort of society, in fact, in which great names and great shames jostle together in the same fierce quest of enjoyment. The heat was increasing, and amid the overcrowded rooms the quadrille unrolled the cadenced symmetry of its figures.","There were still many people dancing. Another quadrille had just started and the floor was gently swaying as if the old house itself was collapsing under the vibration. Amid the blur of pale faces, here and there the head of a woman stood out, bright-eyed, with parted lips, carried away by the rhythm of the dance, her white skin gleaming under the bright chandelier. Madame Du Joncquoy was saying how stupid it was, absolute madness, to cram five hundred people into a space that could barely have held two hundred. Why not sign the marriage contract in the Place de la Concorde? It was the influence of modern ideas, Madame Chantereau claimed; in the old days, solemn occasions like these took place within the family circle but nowadays you had to have a crowd, including anybody and everybody , you had to squash people in or else things wouldn’t go with a swing … You paraded your luxury and invited the ragtag and bobtail of Paris; and naturally such a hotchpotch of society inevitably led to the destruction of the sanctity of the family. The poor ladies were complaining that they didn’t know more than fifty of the guests. Where had all these people come from? There were girls in low-cut dresses flaunting their bare shoulders. One woman had stuck a gold dagger into her chignon, while her jet-bead embroidery made her look as if she was wearing a coat of mail. Another woman was in such a shameless skintight skirt that people were following her progress with amused smiles. In this smart, permissive society dedicated purely to pleasure, full of people whom a society hostess would pick up in the course of some short-lived intimacy, where a duke rubbed shoulders with a crook, the opulence of this last ball of the season was blatant; people wanted one thing only: to have fun. And as the dancers performed the symmetrical figures of the quadrille in time to the music, the overcrowded rooms were becoming hotter and hotter."
"Elle s’était accroupie à ses pieds, cherchant son regard d’un air de tristesse soumise, pour savoir s’il lui en voulait beaucoup ; puis, comme il se remettait, en soupirant longuement, elle se fit plus câline, elle donna une dernière raison, avec une bonté grave :","She had crouched at his feet, searching his gaze with an air of submissive sadness, to know if he was very angry with her; then, as he was recovering, with a long sigh, she became more coaxing, she gave one last reason, with grave kindness:","She had sat down at his feet, and was seeking his glance with a look of submissive tenderness, to see if he was very angry with her.","She had crouched down at his feet and was striving to catch his eye with a look of tender submission. She was fain to know whether he was very vexed with her.

Speaking in an earnest, gentle voice, she offered him one final reason:"
"Et ils montèrent, ils firent leur cour plaisamment, lançant des chiffres, comme s’ils s’étaient disputé Nana aux enchères. La Faloise parlait de la couvrir d’or.

Mais, comme les trois jeunes gens s’échappaient, pour faire de la propagande, Nana leur cria :","And they went upstairs, they courted pleasantly, tossing figures, as if they had fought over Nana at the auction. La Faloise spoke of covering it with gold. Besides, everyone had to put, we were going to solicit the bettors. But, as the three young people escaped, to make propaganda, Nana shouted to them:","And they kept increasing their amount, pleasantly paying their court, quoting figures as though they were bidding for Nana at an auction. La Faloise talked of covering her with gold. Besides, everyone ought to back her for something. They would go and canvass among those willing to bet. But as the three young men hastened off to carry out their design, Nana called to them,","And they mounted up and up, bidding against one another good- humoredly and naming prices as though they had been haggling over Nana at an auction. La Faloise said he would cover her with gold. Besides, everybody was to be made to back her; they would go and pick up backers. But as the three young men were darting off to propagandize, Nana shouted after them:","The three of them climbed into the landau and playfully started flirting with her, throwing figures about as if they were bidding for Nana at an auction. La Faloise was talking about covering her in gold. Moreover, everybody ought to be betting on her, they’d go out and recruit more support. But as the three young men were making off to do some propaganda for her, Nana shouted after them:"

"Mignon voulut se faire annoncer, et Zoé le laissa un instant, après avoir dit que madame avait passé une bien mauvaise journée. Il était venu une seule fois, il ne connaissait pas l’hôtel. La salle à manger, avec ses Gobelins63, son dressoir64, son argenterie l’étonna. Il ouvrit familièrement les portes, visita le salon, le jardin d’hiver, retourna dans le vestibule ; et ce luxe écrasant, les meubles dorés, les soies et les velours, l’emplissaient peu à peu d’une admiration dont son cœur battait. Quand Zoé descendit le prendre, elle offrit de lui montrer les autres pièces, le cabinet de toilette, la chambre à coucher. Alors, dans la chambre, le cœur de Mignon éclata ; il était soulevé, jeté à un attendrissement d’enthousiasme. Cette sacrée Nana le stupéfiait, lui qui s’y connaissait pourtant. Au milieu de la débâcle de la maison, dans le coulage, dans le galop de massacre des domestiques, il y avait un entassement de richesses bouchant quand même les trous et débordant par-dessus les ruines. Et Mignon, en face de ce monument magistral, se rappelait de grands travaux. Près de Marseille, on lui avait montré un aqueduc 65 dont les arches de pierre enjambaient un abîme, œuvre cyclopéenne qui coûtait des millions et dix années de luttes. À Cherbourg, il avait vu le nouveau port, un chantier immense, des centaines d’hommes suant au soleil, des machines comblant la mer de quartiers de roche, dressant une muraille où parfois des ouvriers restaient comme une bouillie sanglante. Mais ça lui semblait petit, Nana l’exaltait davantage ; et il retrouvait, devant son travail, cette sensation de respect éprouvée par lui un soir de fête, dans le château qu’un raffineur s’était fait construire, un palais dont une matière unique, le sucre, avait payé la splendeur royale. Elle, c’était avec autre chose, une petite bêtise dont on riait, un peu de sa nudité délicate, c’était avec ce rien honteux et si puissant, dont la force soulevait le monde66, que toute seule, sans ouvriers, sans machines inventées par des ingénieurs, elle venait d’ébranler Paris et de bâtir cette fortune où dormaient des cadavres.","Mignon wanted to be announced, and Zoe left him for a moment, after saying that Madame had had a very bad day. He had come only once, he did not know the hotel. The dining room, with its Gobelins63, its sideboard64, its silverware astonished him. He opened the doors familiarly, visited the salon, the winter garden, returned to the vestibule; and this overwhelming luxury, the gilded furniture, the silks and the velvets, filled him little by little with an admiration with which his heart beat. When Zoe came down to pick him up, she offered to show him the other rooms, the bathroom, the bedroom. Then, in the bedroom, Mignon's heart burst; he was uplifted, thrown into a tenderness of enthusiasm. This sacred Nana amazed him, he who knew all about it. In the middle of the debacle of the house, in the sinking, in the gallop of slaughter of the servants, there was a heap of riches still plugging the holes and overflowing over the ruins. And Mignon, in front of this majestic monument, remembered great works. Near Marseilles, he had been shown an aqueduct 65 whose stone arches spanned an abyss, a Cyclopean work which cost millions and ten years of struggle. At Cherbourg he had seen the new port, an immense construction site, hundreds of men sweating in the sun, machines filling the sea with sections of rock, erecting a wall where sometimes workers remained like a bloody mush. But it seemed small to him, Nana exalted him more; and he rediscovered, in front of his work, this feeling of respect felt by him one evening of celebration, in the castle which a refiner had had built, a palace whose unique material, sugar, had paid for the royal splendour. She was with something else, a little nonsense that we laughed at, a bit of her delicate nudity, it was with this shameful and so powerful nothing, whose force uplifted the world66, that all alone, without workers, without machines invented by engineers, it had just shaken Paris and built this fortune where corpses slept.","Mignon wished to see Nana, and Zoé left him for a minute, after saying that madame had passed a very unpleasant day. He had only called there once, he did not know the house at all. The dining-room, with its Gobelin tapestry, its sideboard, and its silver plate, amazed him. He familiarly opened the doors, and visited the drawing-room and the winter garden, and then returned to the hall; and this excessive luxury—the gilded furniture, the silks, and the velvets—filled him little by little with an admiration which caused his heart to bump. When Zoé came downstairs to fetch him, she offered to show him the other rooms—the bed-room, the dressing-room. Then, in the bedroom, Mignon’s heart almost burst. He was excited to the highest point of enthusiasm. That confounded Nana astounded him, he who was not easily surprised at anything. In the midst of the downfall of the establishment, of the waste and the massacring gallop of the servants, there was a pile of riches which stopped up the holes and covered the ruins. And Mignon, in the face of that magisterial monument, recalled many great works he had seen. Near Marseilles he had been shown an aqueduct, the stone arches of which spanned an abyss—a Cyclopean work which had cost millions and ten years of struggle. At Cherbourg he had seen the new harbour in course of construction—a gigantic undertaking, hundreds of men sweating in the sunshine, machines filling the sea with huge masses of rock, erecting a wall where at times workmen were squashed to a bloody pulp. But all that seemed small to him now. Nana exalted him far more; and in contemplating her work, he experienced once again that sensation of respect experienced by him one night at an entertainment in a château which a sugar refiner had had built—a palace the royal splendour of which had been paid for by one single thing, sugar. She had paid with something different, a bit of fun at which one laughed—a little of her delicate nudity. It was with this shameful and yet so mighty a nothing, the power of which excited the world, that all alone, without workmen, without machinery invented by engineers, she had shaken Paris and built up that fortune beneath which dead bodies were slumbering.","Mignon wished to be announced, and Zoe left him for a moment after remarking that Madame had passed a miserable day. He had only been at the house once before, and he did not know it at all. The dining room with its Gobelin tapestry, its sideboard and its plate filled him with astonishment. He opened the doors familiarly and visited the drawing room and the winter garden, returning thence into the hall. This overwhelming luxury, this gilded furniture, these silks and velvets, gradually filled him with such a feeling of admiration that it set his heart beating. When Zoe came down to fetch him she offered to show him the other rooms, the dressing room, that is to say, and the bedroom. In the latter Mignon's feelings overcame him; he was carried away by them; they filled him with tender enthusiasm. That damned Nana was simply stupefying him, and yet he thought he knew a thing or two. Amid the downfall of the house and the servants' wild, wasteful race to destruction, massed-up riches still filled every gaping hole and overtopped every ruined wall. And Mignon, as he viewed this lordly monument of wealth, began recalling to mind the various great works he had seen. Near Marseilles they had shown him an aqueduct, the stone arches of which bestrode an abyss, a Cyclopean work which cost millions of money and ten years of intense labor. At Cherbourg he had seen the new harbor with its enormous works, where hundreds of men sweated in the sun while cranes filled the sea with huge squares of rock and built up a wall where a workman now and again remained crushed into bloody pulp. But all that now struck him as insignificant. Nana excited him far more. Viewing the fruit of her labors, he once more experienced the feelings of respect that had overcome him one festal evening in a sugar refiner's chateau. This chateau had been erected for the refiner, and its palatial proportions and royal splendor had been paid for by a single material--sugar. It was with something quite different, with a little laughable folly, a little delicate nudity-- it was with this shameful trifle, which is so powerful as to move the universe, that she alone, without workmen, without the inventions of engineers, had shaken Paris to its foundations and had built up a fortune on the bodies of dead men.","Mignon asked to be shown up to Nana, and Zoé left him for a moment after informing him that her mistress had had a very bad day. Having called on Nana only once before he didn’t know the house, and was amazed by the dining-room with its Gobelins tapestries, its sideboard, and all the silver. He made himself at home, opening doors, inspecting the drawing-room and winter garden before returning to the front hall. Such massive opulence, all this gilt furniture and silk and velvet, was filling him with admiration; his heart was beating fast. When Zoé came to fetch him, she volunteered to show him the other rooms, the dressing-room and the bedroom. The bedroom made Mignon’s heart overflow; he was sent into a paroxysm of emotion. He was an expert in such matters but that bloody Nana was still capable of amazing him. With all its waste and the blood-letting of the decamping servants, the house might be foundering but there were still immense treasures brimming over in the damaged vessel and plugging any leaks. Viewing this colossal monument, Mignon was reminded of other splendid man-made structures: near Marseilles he’d once been shown an aqueduct spanning a deep gorge, a cyclopean work which had cost millions and taken ten years of arduous labour; and in the new port of Cherbourg he’d seen an immense building, with hundreds of men sweating in the sun, machines filling in the sea with huge rocks and erecting a wall which had sometimes reduced workers to bloody pulp; but that all seemed petty, Nana’s performance was more glorious. Her achievement filled him with the same respect which he’d once felt at an evening party given in a château built by a refiner, a veritable palace whose truly royal magnificence had been paid for by one simple commodity: sugar. Nana had used something else, a tiny object, a little thing that people made jokes about, a dainty, naked titbit, a tiny slit, unmentionable and yet possessing the power to shift worlds, so that by its unaided efforts, without any help from workmen or machines invented by engineers, she had sent Paris tottering and built up a fortune on buried corpses."

She shouted:","The bonnet looked frightful with the big feather she had stuck in it. Madame Maloir had a mania for re-making up all her bonnets: she alone knew what suited her, and in a minute she would utterly spoil the most elegant article. Nana, who had bought her the bonnet so as not to feel ashamed every time she went out with her, began to get angry. “Well! you might at least take it off!” she cried.","The hat was smart to distraction. In front it was greatly exaggerated, and it was adorned with a lofty feather. Mme Maloir had a mania for doing up all her hats afresh; she alone knew what really became her, and with a few stitches she could manufacture a toque out of the most elegant headgear. Nana, who had bought her this very hat in order not to be ashamed of her when in her company out of doors, was very near being vexed. ""Push it up, at any rate,"" she cried.","The hat was preposterous, flared out over her forehead and decorated with a long plume on top. Madam Maloir had a mania for remodelling all her hats; she was the only one who knew what suited her, and with a flick of the wrist she could transform the most elegant head-dress into a shabby bonnet. Nana had bought this hat specifically to avoid having to feel ashamed of her and now almost lost her temper. ‘Well, take it off, at least!’ she shouted."

"Ils la prenaient, ils acceptaient le papa, la maman, le passé, ce qu’elle voudrait. Les yeux sur la table, tous quatre maintenant se faisaient petits, tandis qu’elle les tenait sous ses anciennes savates boueuses de la rue de la Goutte-d’Or, avec l’emportement de sa toute-puissance. Et elle ne désarma pas encore : on aurait beau lui apporter des fortunes, lui bâtir des palais, elle regretterait toujours l’époque où elle croquait des pommes. Une blague, cet idiot d’argent ! c’était fait pour les fournisseurs. Puis, son accès se termina dans un désir sentimental d’une vie simple, le cœur sur la main, au milieu d’une bonté universelle.","They took her, they accepted the dad, the mom, the past, whatever she wanted. Eyes on the table, all four now grew small, while she held them under her old muddy slippers of the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, with the passion of her omnipotence. And she did not give up yet: no matter how much we brought her fortunes, built her palaces, she would always regret the time when she bit apples. A joke, this stupid money! it was made for suppliers. Then, his outburst ended in a sentimental longing for a simple life, heart on hand, amid universal goodness.","They took her—they accepted the father and the mother, the past, everything she wished. With their eyes fixed on the table-cloth, they all four now made themselves small, whilst she kept them beneath her muddy old shoes, of the Rue de la Goutte d’Or, with the passion of her all-powerful will. And she was slow to lay down her arms. They might bring her no end of fortunes, build her innumerable palaces, still she would ever regret the time when she used to chew apples with the peel on. It was a fraud, that idiotic money! it was only invented for tradespeople. Then her outburst ended in a sentimental longing for a simple way of living, with one’s heart in one’s hand, in the midst of a universal benevolence.","They took her as required; they accepted the dad, the mamma, the past; in fact, whatever she chose. With their eyes fixed on the tablecloth, the four now sat shrinking and insignificant while Nana, in a transport of omnipotence, trampled on them in the old muddy boots worn long since in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. She was determined not to lay down the cudgels just yet. It was all very fine to bring her fortunes, to build her palaces; she would never leave off regretting the time when she munched apples! Oh, what bosh that stupid thing money was! It was made for the tradespeople! Finally her outburst ended in a sentimentally expressed desire for a simple, openhearted existence, to be passed in an atmosphere of universal benevolence.","They took her as she was, they were happy to accept her Daddy and her Mummy, her own past, anything she liked. Staring hard at the table-cloth, all four were trying to make themselves as small as possible while she trampled over them in the muddy clogs she used to wear in the old days in the Rue de la Goutte d’Or, unable to resist showing her complete domination of them. And she continued to show them no mercy: no, people could offer her all the money in the world, build palaces for her, she’d still miss those days when she ate crunchy apples. All that money was just a farce: it was only fit for tradesmen. And then her outburst petered out into sentimentality, she felt a yearning for the simple life, in which everything would be honest and straight from the heart and everybody would be kind."
"Et il l’abandonna. Son épouvante reprit, elle fit un détour énorme pour rentrer à Montmartre, filant raide le long des boutiques, pâlissant dès qu’un homme s’approchait d’elle.","And he left her. Her terror resumed, she made a huge detour to return to Montmartre, spinning stiffly past the shops, turning pale as soon as a man approached her.","And he walked off. All her fright came back again; she returned to Montmartre by a most roundabout way, keeping close to the shops, and turning pale every time a man came near her.","And with that he left her. Terrors got hold of her again, and scurrying past shops and turning white whenever a man drew nigh, she fetched an immense compass before reaching Montmartre.","And he left her standing there, once again terrified. She took an enormously roundabout route to get back to Montmartre, scurrying along close to the shop-windows as fast as she could, going pale with fright each time she saw a man coming towards her."

"Georges lui sauta au cou. C'était donc vrai, elle l’aimait un peu ! Alors, comme hier, ils éteindraient la lampe, ils resteraient dans le noir jusqu’au jour ? Puis, à un coup de sonnette, il fila légèrement. En haut, dans la chambre, il enleva tout de suite ses souliers pour ne pas faire de bruit ; puis, il se cacha par terre, derrière un rideau, attendant d’un air sage.","Georges jumped on his neck.

It was true, then, she did love him a little! So it would be yesterday over again? They would turn out the lamp, and remain together till daylight dispelled the darkness.

So it was really true? She did love him a bit? So it would be the same as yesterday? They’d turn out the light and stay together in the dark till morning?

"Mais elle lui gardait un bon souvenir, ils s’étaient bien amusés ensemble de cet idiot de la Faloise. Jamais peut-être ils n’auraient eu l’idée de se revoir, si le plaisir de se ficher d’un pareil crétin ne les eût excités. Ça leur semblait une farce, ils s’embrassaient sous son nez, ils faisaient une noce à tout casser avec son argent, ils l’envoyaient en course au bout de Paris, pour rester seuls ; puis, quand il revenait, c’étaient des blagues, des allusions qu’il ne pouvait comprendre. Un jour, poussée par le journaliste, elle paria qu’elle donnerait un soufflet à la Faloise ; le soir même, elle lui donna un soufflet, puis continua à le battre, trouvant ça drôle, heureuse de montrer combien les hommes étaient lâches. Elle l’appelait « son tiroir à claques », lui disait d’avancer pour recevoir sa gifle, des gifles qui lui rougissaient la main, parce qu’elle n’avait pas encore l’habitude. La Faloise riait de son air crevé, avec des larmes dans les yeux. Cette familiarité l’enchantait, il la trouvait épatante.","But she had fond memories of him, they had had a good time together with that idiot from La Faloise. Perhaps they would never have had the idea of seeing each other again, if the pleasure of making fun of such a cretin had not excited them. It seemed like a farce to them, they kissed under his nose, they had an all-out wedding with his money, they sent him on a run to the end of Paris, to be alone; then, when he returned, there were jokes, allusions which he could not understand. One day, prompted by the journalist, she bet that she would give La Faloise a slap in the face; that same evening, she slapped him, then continued to beat him, finding it funny, happy to show how cowardly men were. She called him ""her slap drawer"", told him to come forward to receive his slap, slaps that made her hand red, because she wasn't used to it yet. La Faloise laughed in his tired way, with tears in his eyes. This familiarity enchanted him, he found it amazing.","But she remembered him with pleasure; they had amused themselves so much together with that idiot La Faloise. They would never perhaps have thought of being together again, if the pleasure of humbugging such a fool had not excited them. It seemed to them so funny. They would embrace each other under his nose, they lived the merriest possible life at his expense, they would send him on some errand to the other end of Paris, whenever they wanted to be alone together; then, when he returned, they would make jokes and allusions that he was unable to understand. One day, incited by the journalist, she bet that she would give La Faloise a slap in the face; that very evening she did so, then continued to beat him, finding it amusing, and delighted at being able to show what cowards men were. She called him her slapping machine, told him to come up and receive his slaps, slaps which made her hand quite red, because she was not yet accustomed to the exercise. La Faloise laughed in his idiotic way, with his eyes full of tears. This familiarity delighted him; he thought it grand.","But she always recollected him kindly. They had both enjoyed themselves so much at the expense of that fool of a La Faloise! They would never have thought of seeing each other again if the delight of fooling such a perfect idiot had not egged them on! It seemed an awfully good joke to kiss each other under his very nose. They cut a regular dash with his coin; they would send him off full speed to the other end of Paris in order to be alone and then when he came back, they would crack jokes and make allusions he could not understand. One day, urged by the journalist, she bet that she would smack his face, and that she did the very same evening and went on to harder blows, for she thought it a good joke and was glad of the opportunity of showing how cowardly men were. She called him her ""slapjack"" and would tell him to come and have his smack! The smacks made her hands red, for as yet she was not up to the trick. La Faloise laughed in his idiotic, languid way, though his eyes were full of tears. He was delighted at such familiarity; he thought it simply stunning.","However, she still kept pleasant memories of him: they ’d both had a good time at the expense of that idiot la Faloise. Perhaps the thought of getting together again might never have occurred to them but for the pleasurable excitement of making fun of such a cretin. What a lark it was! They’d kiss each other to his face and go on outrageous sprees which he paid for; they’d send him off on errands to the other side of Paris, and when he returned they’d crack jokes and make innuendoes which he couldn’t understand. One day, egged on by the journalist, she’d made a bet that she’d slap la Faloise’s face and she did it, that very evening; then, warming to the task, she went on doing it, delighted to prove what cowards men are. She nicknamed him her ‘punchball’ and ordered him to come forward and take his medicine; it made her hand smart, she hadn’t yet quite got the knack. La Faloise was laughing, with his dead-beat look and tears in his eyes. He was delighted that they were on such intimate terms; it was marvellous."

"Georges, en entendant sa mère aborder ce sujet, avait baissé le nez dans sa tasse ; mais il le releva et regarda le comte, étonné de sa réponse. Pourquoi mentait-il si carrément ? De son côté, le comte, ayant remarqué le mouvement du jeune homme, lui jeta un coup d’œil de défiance. Madame Hugon continuait à donner des détails : la campagne s’appelait la Mignotte ; il fallait remonter la Choue jusqu’à Gumières pour traverser sur un pont, ce qui allongeait le chemin de deux bons kilomètres ; autrement, on se mouillait les pieds et on risquait un plongeon.","Georges, on hearing his mother bring up this subject, had lowered his nose into his cup; but he raised it and looked at the count, astonished at his reply.

The estate was called La Mignotte. To reach it you had to follow the course of the Choue as far as Gumières, where there was a bridge, and that made the road a good two miles longer; otherwise you had to wade across the stream, and risk falling in.","Hearing his mother broach the subject, Georges looked into his coffee cup, but in his astonishment at the count's answer he glanced up at him and stared.

"Ce qui étonnait la jeune femme, c’était, dans ce fleuve d’or, dont le flot lui coulait entre les membres, d’être sans cesse à court d’argent. Certains jours, elle se trouvait aux abois pour des sommes ridicules de quelques louis. Il lui fallait emprunter à Zoé, ou bien elle battait monnaie 11 elle-même, comme elle pouvait. Mais, avant de se résigner aux moyens extrêmes, elle tâtait ses amis, tirant des hommes ce qu’ils avaient sur eux, jusqu’à des sous, d’un air de plaisanterie. Depuis trois mois, elle vidait surtout les poches de Philippe. Il ne venait plus, dans les moments de crise, sans laisser son porte-monnaie. Bientôt, enhardie, elle lui avait demandé des emprunts, deux cents francs, trois cents francs, jamais davantage, pour des billets12, des dettes criardes ; et Philippe, nommé en juillet capitaine trésorier, apportait l’argent le lendemain, en s’excusant de n’être pas riche, car la bonne maman Hugon traitait maintenant ses fils avec une sévérité singulière. Au bout de trois mois, ces petits prêts, souvent renouvelés, montaient à une dizaine de mille francs. Le capitaine avait toujours son beau rire sonore. Pourtant, il maigrissait, distrait parfois, une ombre de souffrance sur la face. Mais un regard de Nana le transfigurait, dans une sorte d’extase sensuelle. Elle était très chatte avec lui, le grisait de baisers derrière les portes, le possédait par des abandons brusques, qui le clouaient derrière ses jupes, dès qu’il pouvait s’échapper de son service.","What astonished the young woman was, in this golden river, the flood of which flowed between her limbs, to be constantly short of money. On certain days she was desperate for the ridiculous sums of a few louis. She had to borrow from Zoe, or else she would mint coins herself, as best she could. But, before resigning herself to extreme means, she groped her friends, drawing from the men what they had on them, even pennies, with an air of jest. For three months she had been emptying Philippe's pockets above all. He no longer came, in moments of crisis, without leaving his purse. Soon, emboldened, she had asked him for loans, two hundred francs, three hundred francs, never more, for notes,12 for gaudy debts; and Philippe, appointed captain-treasurer in July, brought the money the next day, apologizing for not being rich, for good mother Hugon now treated her sons with singular severity. At the end of three months, these small loans, often renewed, amounted to ten thousand francs. The captain still had his beautiful ringing laugh. However, he was losing weight, sometimes distracted, a shadow of pain on his face. But a look from Nana transfigured him, in a sort of sensual ecstasy. She was very pussy with him, intoxicated him with kisses behind doors, possessed him with sudden abandonments, which nailed him behind her skirts as soon as he could escape from his service.","What surprised the young woman was that in this ever-flowing river of gold she was constantly without money. Some days she scarcely knew what to do for want of the most ridiculous sums, of a few louis. She had to borrow of Zoé or else raise funds any way she could. But before resigning herself to extreme measures, she would sound her friends, getting out of the men whatever they had about them, even sous, in a jocular sort of way. For three months past she had especially been emptying Philippe’s pockets in this manner. He now never called, whenever there was a crisis at hand, without leaving his purse behind him on leaving. Soon, becoming bolder, Nana had begun to ask him for loans—two hundred francs, three hundred francs, never more—for bills becoming due, or debts that could not remain longer unpaid; and Philippe, who, in July, had been made a captain, and pay-master of his regiment, would bring the money on the morrow, with the excuse that he was not rich, for good Madame Hugon now treated her sons with singular harshness. At the end of three months these little loans, often repeated, amounted to some ten thousand francs. The captain still laughed in his hearty, sonorous way, yet he was growing thin, appearing absent-minded at times, with a look of suffering on his face; but a glance from Nana transfigured him, in a sort of sensual ecstasy. She was very playful with him, intoxicating him with kisses behind doors, bewitching him with sudden abandonments of herself, which tied him to her petticoats the whole time he was off duty.","What most astonished the young woman was that she was endlessly short of money amid a river of gold, the tide of which almost enveloped her. On certain days she was at her wit's end for want of ridiculously small sums--sums of only a few louis. She was driven to borrow from Zoe, or she scraped up cash as well as she could on her own account. But before resignedly adopting extreme measures she tried her friends and in a joking sort of way got the men to give her all they had about them, even down to their coppers. For the last three months she had been emptying Philippe's pockets especially, and now on days of passionate enjoyment he never came away but he left his purse behind him. Soon she grew bolder and asked him for loans of two hundred francs, three hundred francs-- never more than that--wherewith to pay the interest of bills or to stave off outrageous debts. And Philippe, who in July had been appointed paymaster to his regiment, would bring the money the day after, apologizing at the same time for not being rich, seeing that good Mamma Hugon now treated her sons with singular financial severity. At the close of three months these little oft-renewed loans mounted up to a sum of ten thousand francs. The captain still laughed his hearty-sounding laugh, but he was growing visibly thinner, and sometimes he seemed absent-minded, and a shade of suffering would pass over his face. But one look from Nana's eyes would transfigure him in a sort of sensual ecstasy. She had a very coaxing way with him and would intoxicate him with furtive kisses and yield herself to him in sudden fits of self-abandonment, which tied him to her apron strings the moment he was able to escape from his military duties.","One thing that surprised the young woman was that, despite this stream of money flowing through her thighs, she was permanently short of cash. Some days she found herself at a loss to lay hands on ridiculously small sums, a couple of louis. She had either to borrow from Zoé or look around to see if she could scrape something together through her own efforts. However, before resorting to extreme measures she’d try out her friends, extracting whatever they happened to have on their persons at the time, even if it was only a franc or two. For the last three months she’d been mainly milking Philippe, who discovered that in her moments of crisis he could no longer call on her without having his wallet emptied. She soon became more ambitious and asked him for loans, two or three hundred francs, never more, to meet pressing debts or IOUs; and Philippe, who’d been promoted captain in July and put in charge of the regimental funds, would bring the money along the following day, apologizing for not being flush because his dear mother was far from open-handed with her sons. After three months these little loans, regularly repeated, amounted to some ten thousand or so francs. The captain was still emitting his loud guffaw, but he looked thinner and occasionally preoccupied, even somewhat careworn. But a glance from Nana would transform him and throw him into a sort of sensual ecstasy. She behaved very kittenishly with him, driving him crazy with her kisses behind doors and suddenly pouncing on him to give herself to him. Any free time he could get away from his military duties he spent sniffing round her skirts."
"Et elle fit une scène affreuse à Steiner, qui trouvait très correcte l’attitude de ces messieurs. Alors, elles ne méritaient pas même un coup de chapeau ? le premier goujat venu pouvait les insulter ? Merci, il était propre, lui aussi ; c’était complet. On devait toujours saluer une femme.","And she made a frightful scene at Steiner, who found the attitude of these gentlemen very correct. So they didn't even deserve a tip of the hat? the first cad come across could insult them? Thank you, he was clean too; it was complete. You always had to greet a woman.","Then she had a frightful quarrel with Steiner, who considered that the gentlemen had behaved admirably. So they were not even worth the raising of a hat? The first blackguard they met might insult them? Thanks, he also was a nice fellow, he was; it only wanted that. One should always bow to a woman.","And with that she gave Steiner a terrible dressing, he having ventured to suggest that the gentlemen's attitude had been quite as it should be. So then they weren't even worth a bow? The first blackguard that came by might insult them? Thanks! He was the right sort, too, he was! It couldn't be better! One ought always to bow to a woman.",And she flared up when Steiner expressed the view that the gentlemen had behaved very correctly. So they weren’t even good enough to take your hat off to? They could let any lout insult them? Thanks very much! He was a shit too! That just about put the lid on it! You ought always to take your hat off to a lady.
"Du coup, ces messieurs ne purent cacher une très réelle surprise. Tous levèrent la tête. Eh quoi ! Nana était arrivée ! Mais ils ne l’attendaient que le lendemain, ils croyaient la devancer ! Seul, Georges resta les cils baissés, regardant son verre, d’un air las. Depuis le commencement du déjeuner, il semblait dormir, les yeux ouverts, vaguement souriant.","Suddenly, these gentlemen could not hide a very real surprise. All raised their heads. Oh what! Nana had arrived! But they were only expecting her the next day, they thought they were ahead of her! Alone, Georges remained with lowered eyelashes, looking at his glass, wearily. Since the beginning of lunch, he seemed to be asleep, his eyes open, vaguely smiling.","On receiving this information, none of the gentlemen could hide their genuine astonishment. They all looked up. What! Nana had arrived! And they were not expecting her till the morrow; they had thought they were before her! George, alone, did not raise his eyes, but looked at his tumbler in a wearied sort of way. Ever since the beginning of the meal he had seemed asleep with his eyes open, and a vague smile hovered about his lips.",At these words the gentlemen could not conceal their very real surprise. They all looked up. Eh? What? Nana had come down! But they were only expecting her next day; they were privately under the impression that they would arrive before her! Georges alone sat looking at his glass with drooped eyelids and a tired expression. Ever since the beginning of lunch he had seemed to be sleeping with open eyes and a vague smile on his lips.,"This time the gentlemen were genuinely surprised and couldn’t help showing it. They all looked up. Good Lord! Nana had already arrived? But they weren’t expecting her until the next day and thought they’d arrived before her! Only Georges sat gazing at his glass through half-closed eyes with a tired look on his face. Ever since the beginning of lunch he’d seemed to be asleep with his eyes open, vaguely smiling."
"Ce soir-là, comme d’habitude, le comte Muffat monta le coteau pour sonner à la grille. Mais le flamboiement des fenêtres, les grands rires, l’étonnèrent. Il comprit, en reconnaissant la voix de Mignon, et s’éloigna, enragé par ce nouvel obstacle, poussé à bout, résolu à quelque violence. Georges, qui passait par une petite porte dont il avait une clef, monta tranquillement dans la chambre de Nana, en filant le long des murs. Seulement, il dut l’attendre jusqu’à minuit passé. Elle parut enfin, très grise, plus maternelle encore que les autres nuits ; quand elle buvait, ça la rendait si amoureuse, qu’elle en devenait collante. Ainsi, elle voulait absolument qu’il l’accompagnât à l’abbaye de Chamont. Lui résistait, ayant peur d’être vu ; si on l’apercevait en voiture avec elle, ça ferait un scandale abominable. Mais elle fondit en larmes, prise d’un désespoir bruyant de femme sacrifiée, et il la consola, il lui promit formellement d’être de la partie.","That evening, as usual, Count Muffat went up the hill to ring the gate. But the flashing of the windows, the great laughter, astonished him. He understood, on recognizing Mignon's voice, and went away, enraged by this new obstacle, pushed to the limit, resolved to some violence. Georges, who was going through a little door to which he had a key, quietly went up to Nana's room, slipping along the walls. But he had to wait until after midnight. At last she appeared, very tipsy, even more maternal than on the other nights; when she drank, it made her so in love, she got clingy. So she absolutely wanted him to accompany her to the Abbey of Chamont. He resisted, fearing to be seen; if we saw him in the car with her, it would cause an abominable scandal. But she burst into tears, seized with the noisy despair of a sacrificed woman, and he consoled her, he formally promised to be there.","That night, as usual, Count Muffat ascended the hill to ring the bell at the iron gates. But the lights in the windows, the loud laughter surprised him. Recognising Mignon ’s voice he understood it all, and went away enraged by this new obstacle, driven to extremities, determined to use violence. George, who entered by a little side-door of which he had a key, quietly ascended to Nana’s bed-room, keeping close to the walls. Only he had to wait for her until past midnight. She came at last, very tipsy, and more maternal even than on the other nights. When she drank it made her so loving that there was rather too much of it. Thus, she insisted on George’s accompanying her to the abbey of Chamont. He resisted, afraid of being seen: if he was noticed in a carriage with her it would cause a frightful scandal. But she burst into tears, seized with the noisy despair of a discarded woman, and he consoled her, and faithfully promised to be one of the party.","That evening, as his wont was, Count Muffat mounted the hill to ring at the outer gate. But the brightly lit windows and the shouts of laughter astonished him. When, however, he recognized Mignon's voice, he understood it all and went off, raging at this new obstacle, driven to extremities, bent on some violent act. Georges passed through a little door of which he had the key, slipped along the staircase walls and went quietly up into Nana's room. Only he had to wait for her till past midnight. She appeared at last in a high state of intoxication and more maternal even than on the previous nights. Whenever she had drunk anything she became so amorous as to be absurd. Accordingly she now insisted on his accompanying her to the Abbey of Chamont. But he stood out against this; he was afraid of being seen. If he were to be seen driving with her there would be an atrocious scandal. But she burst into tears and evinced the noisy despair of a slighted woman. And he thereupon consoled her and formally promised to be one of the party.","When Count Muffat came up the hill as usual that evening, he was surprised by the blaze of light from the windows and the sound of loud laughter. Hearing Mignon’s voice, he realized what had happened and went away again, infuriated at this new obstacle, his patience exhausted, and determined to take drastic action. Georges had the key to a side-door; he crept along the wall of the house and quietly slipped upstairs. However, he found he had to wait till after midnight. When Nana appeared she was very tipsy and even more motherly than on earlier nights. When she’d been drinking she became so amorous that she clung like a leech, and she now insisted that he must come along with her to the abbey of Chamont. He tried to get out of it by pointing out that he was afraid of being seen, and if anyone were to catch sight of him in her carriage there’d be hell to pay. She burst into tears of despair and loudly proclaimed that she was being victimized; to comfort her, he promised he would come on the excursion."

62. Pour la battre ; c’était l’expression de Coupeau.,62. To beat her; it was Coupeau's expression.,"she stuttered, in a last outburst of sobs.",The Petite Duchesse was being rehearsed at the Varietes.,"On the proscenium, Fauchery and Bordenave were sitting in a couple of old armchairs having a discussion while Cossard, the prompter, an aged hunchback, sat on a rushseated chair with a pencil held between his teeth, thumbing through the script."
"Le soir de la rupture, Mignon se présenta avenue de Villiers. Il s’accoutumait à Fauchery, il finissait par trouver mille avantages dans la présence d’un mari 60 chez sa femme, lui laissait les petits soins du ménage, se reposait sur lui pour une surveillance active, employait aux dépenses quotidiennes de la maison l’argent de ses succès dramatiques ; et comme, d’autre part, Fauchery se montrait raisonnable, sans jalousie ridicule, aussi coulant que Mignon lui-même sur les occasions trouvées par Rose, les deux hommes s’entendaient de mieux en mieux, heureux de leur association fertile en bonheurs de toutes sortes, faisant chacun son trou côte à côte, dans un ménage où ils ne se gênaient plus. C’était réglé, ça marchait très bien, ils rivalisaient l’un l’autre pour la félicité commune. Justement, Mignon venait, sur le conseil de Fauchery, voir s’il ne pourrait pas enlever à Nana sa femme de chambre, dont le journaliste avait apprécié l’intelligence hors ligne ; Rose était désolée, elle tombait depuis un mois sur des filles inexpérimentées, qui la mettaient dans des embarras continuels. Comme Zoé le recevait, il la poussa tout de suite dans la salle à manger. Au premier mot, elle eut un sourire : impossible, elle quittait madame, elle s’établissait à son compte ; et elle ajouta, d’un air de vanité discrète, que chaque jour elle recevait des propositions, ces dames se la disputaient, madame Blanche 61 lui avait fait un pont d’or pour la ravoir. Zoé prenait l’établissement de la Tricon ; un vieux projet longtemps couvé, une ambition de fortune où allaient passer ses économies ; elle était pleine d’idées larges, elle rêvait d’agrandir la chose, de louer un hôtel et d’y réunir tous les agréments ; c’était même à ce propos qu’elle avait tâché d’embaucher Satin, une petite bête qui se mourait à l’hôpital, tellement elle se gâchait.","On the evening of the break-up, Mignon presented himself in the avenue de Villiers. He grew accustomed to Fauchery, he ended by finding a thousand advantages in the presence of a husband 60 at his wife's house, left him the small cares of the household, relied on him for an active supervision, employed in the daily expenses of the house the money from his dramatic successes; and since, on the other hand, Fauchery showed himself to be reasonable, without ridiculous jealousy, as flowing as Mignon himself on the occasions found by Rose, the two men got on better and better, happy in their association fertile in the happiness of all kinds, each making his own hole side by side, in a household where they no longer bothered each other. It was settled, it was going very well, they were vying with each other for the common bliss. It so happened that Mignon had come, on Fauchery's advice, to see if he could not take away from Nana her chambermaid, whose intelligence the journalist had appreciated outside the line; Rose was sorry, she had been falling for a month on inexperienced girls, who put her in continual embarrassment. As Zoe received him, he immediately pushed her into the dining room. At the first word, she smiled: impossible, she was leaving Madame, she was setting up on her own; and she added, with an air of discreet vanity, that every day she received proposals, the ladies fought over her, Madame Blanche had made her a golden bridge to win her back. Zoe took over the Tricon establishment; an old project long hatched, an ambition of fortune where his savings were going to pass; she was full of grand ideas, she dreamed of enlarging the thing, of renting a hotel and of bringing together all the conveniences there; it was even for this purpose that she had tried to hire Satin, a little beast who was dying in the hospital, she was so wasted.","The night of the rupture Mignon called at the Avenue de Villiers. He had got accustomed to Fauchery, he had ended by discovering a thousand advantages in the presence of a husband at his wife’s. He left to him all the little cares of the home, relied on him for an active supervision, and used the money that came from his dramatic successes for the daily expenses of the household; and as, on the other hand, Fauchery behaved very reasonably—never indulging in any ridiculous jealousy, but being as accommodating as Mignon himself with regard to the opportunities Rose had—the two men got on together better than ever, delighted with their association, so fertile in every kind of happiness, and each one making his nest beside the other, in a home where neither of them any longer stood on ceremony. It was regulated, it worked very well, they rivalled each other in their exertions for the common felicity. It just happened that Mignon had called, by Fauchery’s advice, to see if he could not entice away Nana ’s maid, whose wonderful intelligence the journalist had fully appreciated. Rose was in great distress. For a month past she had had to put up with inexperienced girls, who caused her continual embarrassments. As Zoé admitted him, he pushed her at once into the dining-room. At the first word she smiled. It was impossible. She was leaving madame, she was about to set up in business on her own account; and she added, with an air of discreet vanity, that every day she was receiving proposals—all the ladies wanted her. Madame Blanche had offered her a bridge of gold to get her back. Zoé was going to acquire old Tricon’s business, an old project which she had nursed for a long while, an ambition to realise a fortune, in which she was about to invest her savings. She was full of great ideas. She dreamed of enlarging the concern, of taking a mansion, and collecting in it every pleasure. It was for this that she had even tried to get hold of Satin, a little blockhead who was now dying in the hospital, she had so ruined her health.","On the evening of the final rupture Mignon presented himself at the house in the Avenue de Villiers. He was growing accustomed to Fauchery and was beginning at last to find the presence of his wife's husband infinitely advantageous to him. He would leave all the little household cares to the journalist and would trust him in the active superintendence of all their affairs. Nay, he devoted the money gained by his dramatic successes to the daily expenditure of the family, and as, on his part, Fauchery behaved sensibly, avoiding ridiculous jealousy and proving not less pliant than Mignon himself whenever Rose found her opportunity, the mutual understanding between the two men constantly improved. In fact, they were happy in a partnership which was so fertile in all kinds of amenities, and they settled down side by side and adopted a family arrangement which no longer proved a stumbling block. The whole thing was conducted according to rule; it suited admirably, and each man vied with the other in his efforts for the common happiness. That very evening Mignon had come by Fauchery's advice to see if he could not steal Nana's lady's maid from her, the journalist having formed a high opinion of the woman's extraordinary intelligence. Rose was in despair; for a month past she had been falling into the hands of inexperienced girls who were causing her continual embarrassment. When Zoe received him at the door he forthwith pushed her into the dining room. But at his opening sentence she smiled. The thing was impossible, she said, for she was leaving Madame and establishing herself on her own account. And she added with an expression of discreet vanity that she was daily receiving offers, that the ladies were fighting for her and that Mme Blanche would give a pile of gold to have her back. Zoe was taking the Tricon's establishment. It was an old project and had been long brooded over. It was her ambition to make her fortune thereby, and she was investing all her savings in it. She was full of great ideas and meditated increasing the business and hiring a house and combining all the delights within its walls. It was with this in view that she had tried to entice Satin, a little pig at that moment dying in hospital, so terribly had she done for herself.","In the evening of the same day that Nana and Muffat parted for ever, Mignon called at the Avenue de Villiers. He’d been getting used to Fauchery and had come to the conclusion that there were very many advantages in having found a husband for his wife; he could leave little domestic matters for him to attend to, rely on him to keep a wary eye open and use the money he earned from his theatrical ventures, when successful, to meet day-to-day expenses; and as, on the other hand, Fauchery was proving sensible, not ridiculously jealous and as accommodating as Mignon himself towards the occasional windfalls which came Rose’s way, the two men were getting on better and better, enjoying an association which was proving a rich source of pleasure of all sorts, each in a cosy niche, side by side as part of a family where they were no longer getting in each other’s way. The whole thing was running as smooth as clockwork, with not a single hitch, and they were both making every possible effort to ensure that everyone was being looked after. In fact Mignon was calling, on Fauchery’s advice, to see if he couldn’t snaffle Nana’s maid, who had greatly impressed the journalist by her outstanding intelligence. Rose was at her wit’s end; for the last month she’d been having to cope with inexperienced girls who were continually landing her in embarrassing situations. As Zoé herself let him in, he immediately cornered her in the dining-room. At his first words, Zoé gave a smile: out of the question, she was leaving her mistress to set up on her own; and looking quietly smug, she added that offers were coming in every day, the ladies were falling over each other to get her; Madame Blanche had promised her a large sum to get her back. However, Zoé herself intended to take over Tricon’s business, a plan which she’d been hatching for a very long time, in an ambitious bid to make her fortune that would take every penny of her savings; she was full of grandiose ideas, she had dreams of expanding the business by renting a splendid mansion which would provide every sort of amenity. It was with this in view that she’d recently tried to recruit Satin, but the silly little girl was now lying fatally ill in hospital as a result of the messy life she’d been living."
"« Ah ! çà, dit-il, dès qu’il eut rejoint son cousin, ce Labordette connaît donc toutes les femmes ?... Le voilà maintenant avec Blanche.","“Oh! There, he said, as soon as he had rejoined his cousin, this Labordette knows all the women?... There he is now with Blanche.","“I say,” said he, as he joined his cousin, “this Labordette appears to know all the women. He’s with Blanche now.”","""Gad,"" he said after rejoining his cousin, ""that Labordette knows all the girls then! He's with Blanche now.""","‘Well, well!’ he said when he’d caught up with his cousin. ‘Does this man Labordette know all the women? He’s with Blanche now.’"
"Alors, elle s’abattit de nouveau à ses pieds, dans une crise de fou rire, bégayant, lui donnant des tapes.","Then she fell again at his feet, in a fit of giggles, stammering, slapping him.","Then she again rolled herself at his feet in a wild fit of laughter, stuttering and slapping his legs.","Thereupon she again sank down at his feet. She was shaking with uproarious laughter, and she stuttered and dealt him little slaps.","Hearing that, she fell back again at his feet, in a fit of uncontrollable laughter, giving him little taps. ‘Oh no, that’s too good to be true!’ she spluttered."
"Dix heures sonnèrent. Muffat, brusquement, pensa qu’il lui était bien facile de s’assurer si Nana se trouvait dans sa loge. Il monta les trois marches, traversa le petit vestibule badigeonné de jaune, puis se glissa dans la cour par une porte qui fermait simplement au loquet. À cette heure, la cour, étroite, humide comme un fond de puits, avec ses cabinets d’aisances empestés, sa fontaine, le fourneau de cuisine et les plantes dont la concierge l’encombrait, était noyée d’une vapeur noire ; mais les deux murs qui se dressaient, troués de fenêtres, flamboyaient : en bas le magasin des accessoires et le poste des pompiers, à gauche l’administration, à droite et en haut les loges des artistes. C'était, le long de ce puits, comme des gueules de four ouvertes sur les ténèbres. Le comte avait tout de suite vu les vitres de la loge éclairées, au premier étage ; et, soulagé, heureux, il s’oubliait, les yeux en l’air, dans la boue grasse et la fade puanteur de ce derrière de vieille maison parisienne. De grosses gouttes tombaient d’une gouttière crevée. Un rayon de gaz, glissé de la fenêtre de madame Bron, jaunissait un bout de pavé moussu, un bas de muraille mangé par les eaux d’un évier, tout un coin d’ordures embarrassé de vieux seaux et de terrines fendues, où verdissait dans une marmite un maigre fusain. Il y eut un grincement d'espagnolette5, le comte se sauva.","Ten o'clock struck. Muffat suddenly thought it would be very easy for him to ascertain whether Nana was in her box. He climbed the three steps, crossed the small yellow-washed vestibule, then slipped into the yard through a door that simply latched. At this hour the yard, narrow, damp as the bottom of a well, with its pestilential lavatories, its fountain, the kitchen stove and the plants with which the concierge encumbered it, was drowned in a black vapour; but the two walls which rose up, pierced with windows, blazed: below the store of accessories and the fire station, on the left the administration, on the right and above the dressing rooms of the artists. It was, along this shaft, like the mouths of an oven opening into the darkness. The Count had immediately seen the lighted windows of the box on the first floor; and, relieved, happy, he forgot himself, his eyes in the air, in the greasy mud and the insipid stench of this back of an old Parisian house. Great drops were falling from a burst gutter. A ray of gas, slipping from Madame Bron's window, yellowed a bit of mossy pavement, a lower part of the wall devoured by the waters of a sink, a whole corner of rubbish cluttered with old buckets and cracked bowls, where in a pot a meager charcoal. There was a creaking of the latch, the Count ran away.","Ten o’clock struck. Muffat suddenly remembered that it was easy enough for him to see if Nana was in her dressing-room. He went up the three steps, passed through the little hall besmeared with a coat of yellow paint, and reached the courtyard by a door that was only latched. At that hour the courtyard, narrow and damp like a well, with its foul-smelling closets, its water-tap, the kitchen-stove, and the plants with which the doorkeeper lumbered it, was bathed in a black mist; but the two walls which rose up, studded with windows, were ablaze with light. Below were the property-room and the firemen’s station, on the left the manager’s rooms, on the right and up above the dressing-rooms. On the sides of this well they looked like so many oven doors opening into darkness. The count had at once noticed a light in the window of the dressing-room on the first floor; and, feeling relieved and happy, he stood there in the greasy mud, looking up in the air, and inhaling the unsavoury stench at this back of an old Parisian house. Large drops were running down from a cracked water pipe. A ray of gaslight, from Madame Bron’s window, gave a yellow tinge to a bit of the moss-covered pavement, to the foot of a wall eaten away by the water from a sink, and to a heap of rubbish on which innumerable old pails and cracked pots and pans had been thrown together, with a saucepan in which a scraggy spindle-tree was vainly endeavouring to grow. There was heard the sound of a window opening, and the count hastened away.","Ten o'clock struck, and suddenly it occurred to Muffat that it would be very easy to find out whether Nana were in her dressing room or not. He went up the three steps, crossed the little yellow-painted lobby and slipped into the court by a door which simply shut with a latch. At that hour of the night the narrow, damp well of a court, with its pestiferous water closets, its fountain, its back view ot the kitchen stove and the collection of plants with which the portress used to litter the place, was drenched in dark mist; but the two walls, rising pierced with windows on either hand, were flaming with light, since the property room and the firemen's office were situated on the ground floor, with the managerial bureau on the left, and on the right and upstairs the dressing rooms of the company. The mouths of furnaces seemed to be opening on the outer darkness from top to bottom of this well. The count had at once marked the light in the windows of the dressing room on the first floor, and as a man who is comforted and happy, he forgot where he was and stood gazing upward amid the foul mud and faint decaying smell peculiar to the premises of this antiquated Parisian building. Big drops were dripping from a broken waterspout, and a ray of gaslight slipped from Mme Bron's window and cast a yellow glare over a patch of moss-clad pavement, over the base of a wall which had been rotted by water from a sink, over a whole cornerful of nameless filth amid which old pails and broken crocks lay in fine confusion round a spindling tree growing mildewed in its pot. A window fastening creaked, and the count fled.","It struck ten. Muffat suddenly realized that it was very easy for him to discover if Nana was in her dressing-room. He went up the three steps, crossed the tiny, yellow distempered entrance hall, and slipped out into the yard through a latched door. At this time of night the narrow courtyard, as damp as the bottom of a well, with its stinking toilets, its water tap, the kitchen oven, and the clutter of plants left there by the caretaker, was hidden in a murky haze; but the two high walls were ablaze with lighted windows: down below, the props room and the firemen’s duty room; on the left the manager’s office, and on the right and above, the dressing-rooms, giving the impression, all the way up this sort of pit-face, of oven-doors opening out on to the gloom. The count had seen straight away that the windows of the dressing-rooms on the first floor were all lit up. Happy and relieved, still looking up, he relaxed, amidst the stale stench and sticky mud of this backyard of an old Paris house. From a broken gutter large drops of water were dripping, while a stray beam of light from Madame Bron’s window cast a yellow patch on to a few mossy cobbles, the foot of the wall eaten away by water from a sink, a real rubbish tip cluttered with old pails and cracked earthenware pots and pans; a limp euonymus provided a touch of green. The count heard the scraping of a window-latch and made himself scarce."
"Mais, dans le couloir, le tintement de la sonnette du père Barillot approchait. Quand il parut à la porte de la loge, il resta saisi, en apercevant les trois acteurs encore dans leurs costumes du second acte.","But in the corridor the ringing of Father Barillot's doorbell was approaching. When he appeared at the door of the box, he was startled on seeing the three actors still in their costumes from the second act.","Old Barillot now came along the passage tingling his bell. When he appeared at the dressing-room door and saw the three actors still in their second act costumes, he was almost dumb-foundered.",But Father Barillot's tinkling bell approached along the passage. At the door of the dressing room he stood amazed when he caught sight of the three actors still clad in the costumes which they had worn in the second act.,But old Barillot could be heard coming down the corridor ringing his bell. When he appeared in the doorway he stood stunned to see the three actors still in their second-act costumes.

It's all over--he's gone to quiet your mamma!""","‘Your brother realized straight away what sort of house he was in. You can see, I might have been some sort of tart, in which case he’d have had the right to intervene because of your age and the honour of the family.

So stop worrying, it’s all over and done with, he’ll be able to reassure your mama.’"

"Les deux portes du foyer restaient grandes ouvertes sur le corridor menant aux coulisses. Le long du mur jaune vivement éclairé par une lanterne à gaz qu’on ne voyait pas, des silhouettes rapides filaient, des hommes costumés, des femmes à demi nues, enveloppées dans des châles, toute la figuration du second acte, les chienlits du bastringue de La Boule Noire8 ; et l’on entendait, au bout du corridor, la dégringolade des pieds tapant les cinq marches de bois qui descendaient sur la scène.

Et elle reparut presque aussitôt, en effet, grelottante sous la mince tunique et l’écharpe d'Iris9.","The two doors of the foyer remained wide open on the corridor leading to the wings.

As the tall Clarisse ran past, Simonne called her; but she answered that she would come back at once. And she reappeared almost immediately, in fact, shivering under Iris' thin tunic and scarf.","The two doors were wide open, showing the passage leading to the dressing-rooms; and along the yellow wall, vividly lighted up by an unseen gas-lamp, shadows were rapidly passing of men in various costumes, women, half-naked, wrapped in shawls, all the chorus of the second act, with the masqueraders of the “Boule Noire”; and from the end of the passage one could hear the sound of their feet stamping on the five wooden steps which led on to the stage. As tall Clarisse rapidly passed by, Simone called to her; but she answered that she would be back in a minute. And, in fact, she returned shortly afterwards, shivering in the thin tunic and sash which formed Iris’s costume.","The two greenroom doors stood wide open to the corridor leading to the wings. And along the yellow wall, which was brightly lit up by a gas lamp out of view, passed a string of rapidly moving shadows-- men in costume, women with shawls over their scant attire, in a word, the whole of the characters in the second act, who would shortly make their appearance as masqeuraders in the ball at the Boule Noire. And at the end of the corridor became audible a shuffling of feet as these people clattered down the five wooden steps which led to the stage. As the big Clarisse went running by Simonne called to her, but she said she would be back directly. And, indeed, she reappeared almost at once, shivering in the thin tunic and scarf which she wore as Iris.","The two green-room doors had been left wide open on to the passage leading backstage.

"Nana se taisait. Elle venait d’apercevoir, au plus épais des équipages, la Tricon. Arrivée dans un fiacre, d’où elle ne voyait rien, la Tricon était tranquillement montée sur le siège du cocher.

They all discreetly smiled to her. She, as a superior being, pretended not to know them. She was not there to work, she came to see the races for pleasure, for she was an inveterate gambler, and was mad about horses.","Nana was silent, for she had just noticed the Tricon amid the thick of the carriages. Having arrived in a cab, whence she could not see anything, the Tricon had quietly mounted the coach box.

She turned up her nose and pretended not to know them. She hadn’t come there to work but for pleasure; as a passionate gambler, she went to the races to enjoy herself."

"Les voitures avaient passé au milieu de ce malaise de gens qui se connaissaient et qui ne se saluaient pas. Cette rencontre délicate, si rapide, semblait s’être éternisée. Et, maintenant, les roues emportaient plus gaiement dans la campagne blonde ces charretées de filles fouettées de grand air ; des bouts de toilettes vives flottaient, des rires recommençaient, avec des plaisanteries et des regards jetés en arrière, sur ces gens comme il faut, restés au bord de la route, l’air vexé. Nana, en se retournant, put voir les promeneurs hésiter, puis revenir sur leurs pas, sans traverser le pont. Madame Hugon s’appuyait au bras du comte Muffat, muette, et si triste, que personne n’osait la consoler.","The cars had passed in the middle of this malaise of people who knew each other and who did not greet each other. This delicate meeting, so quick, seemed to have gone on forever. And now the wheels carried more gaily across the blond countryside these cartloads of girls whipped in the open air; scraps of bright toilets floated, laughter began again, with jokes and glances thrown back, on these decent people, who had remained by the side of the road, looking vexed.

This delicate encounter, so rapid in reality, had seemed to last an eternity. And, now, the wheels were gaily carrying away into the sunny country those vehicles full of girls, with the wind blowing in their faces. Ribbons were flying about, the laughter commenced again, and jokes passed from one to another; whilst some stood up and gazed back at those highly respectable people, who had remained stationary at the side of the road, looking very much put out. Nana, as she glanced round, could see them hesitate, then retrace their steps without crossing the bridge at all. Madame Hugon was leaning on Count Muffat’s arm, silent, and so sad that no one dared console her.","The carriages had passed quite through the uncomfortable crowd of people who recognized and yet gave no sign of recognition. The short critical encounter seemed to have been going on for ages. And now the wheels whirled away the carriageloads of girls more gaily than ever. Toward the fair open country they went, amid the buffetings of the fresh air of heaven. Bright-colored fabrics fluttered in the wind, and the merry laughter burst forth anew as the voyagers began jesting and glancing back at the respectable folks halting with looks of annoyance at the roadside. Turning round, Nana could see the walking party hesitating and then returning the way they had come without crossing the bridge. Mme Hugon was leaning silently on Count Muffat's arm, and so sad was her look that no one dared comfort her.","The carriages proceeded on their way; the atmosphere was tense; people who were acquainted had refused to recognize each other. The awkward encounter had lasted a few seconds, which had seemed an eternity. However, enlivened by the fresh air, the carriage-loads of young women now became jollier than ever as the wheels clattered away through the golden landscape; vivid flecks of dresses fluttered in the breeze as they started laughing and joking again, turning to look over their shoulders at these prim and proper people standing by the roadside, terribly put out. Looking back Nana saw the walkers hesitate and then retrace their steps, not crossing the bridge. Madame Hugon was leaning on Count Muffat’s arm, saying nothing, and with such a sad expression that nobody had the heart to try to comfort her."

"En arrivant au pied de l’escalier, le comte avait senti de nouveau un souffle ardent lui tomber sur la nuque, cette odeur de femme descendue des loges, dans un flot de lumière et de bruit ; et, maintenant, à chaque marche qu’il montait, le musc des poudres, les aigreurs de vinaigre de toilette52 le chauffaient, l’étourdissaient davantage. Au premier, deux corridors s’enfonçaient, tournaient brusquement, avec des portes d’hôtel meublé suspect, peintes en jaune, portant de gros numéros blancs ; par terre, les carreaux descellés faisaient des bosses, dans le tassement de la vieille maison. Le comte se hasarda, jeta un coup d’œil par une porte entrouverte, vit une pièce très sale, une échoppe de perruquier de faubourg, meublée de deux chaises, d’une glace et d’une planchette à tiroir, noircie par la crasse des peignes. Un gaillard en sueur, les épaules fumantes, y changeait de linge ; tandis que, dans une chambre pareille, à côté, une femme près de partir mettait ses gants, les cheveux défrisés et mouillés, comme si elle venait de prendre un bain. Mais Fauchery appelait le comte, et celui-ci arrivait au second, lorsqu’un « nom de Dieu ! » furieux sortit du corridor de droite ; Mathilde, un petit torchon d’ingénue53, venait de casser sa cuvette, dont l’eau savonneuse coulait jusqu’au palier. Une loge se referma violemment. Deux femmes en corset traversèrent d’un saut ; une autre, le bord de sa chemise aux dents, parut et se sauva. Puis, il y eut des rires, une querelle, une chanson commencée et tout d’un coup interrompue. Le long du couloir, par les fentes, on apercevait des coins de nudité, des blancheurs de peau, des pâleurs de linge ; deux filles, très gaies, se montraient leurs signes 54 ; une, toute jeune, presque une enfant, avait relevé ses jupons au-dessus des genoux, pour recoudre son pantalon ; pendant que les habilleuses, en voyant les deux hommes, tiraient légèrement des rideaux, par décence. C'était la bousculade de la fin, le grand nettoyage du blanc et du rouge, la toilette de ville reprise au milieu d’un nuage de poudre de riz, un redoublement d’odeur fauve soufflé par les portes battantes. Au troisième étage, Muffat s’abandonna à la griserie qui l’envahissait. La loge des figurantes était là ; vingt femmes entassées, une débandade de savons et de bouteilles d’eau de lavande, la salle commune d’une maison de barrière55. En passant, il entendit, derrière une porte close, un lavage féroce, une tempête dans une cuvette. Et il montait au dernier étage, lorsqu’il eut la curiosité de hasarder encore un regard, par un judas resté ouvert : la pièce était vide, il n’y avait, sous le flamboiement du gaz, qu’un pot de chambre oublié, au milieu d’un désordre de jupes traînant par terre. Cette pièce fut la dernière vision qu’il emporta. En haut, au quatrième, il étouffait. Toutes les odeurs, toutes les flammes venaient frapper là : le plafond jaune semblait cuit, une lanterne brûlait dans un brouillard roussâtre. Un instant, il se tint à la rampe de fer, qu’il trouva tiède d’une tiédeur vivante, et il ferma les yeux, et il but dans une aspiration tout le sexe de la femme, qu’il ignorait encore et qui lui battait le visage.","On reaching the foot of the stairs, the Count had once again felt an ardent breath fall on the back of his neck, that feminine odor descending from the boxes in a flood of light and noise; and now, with each step he climbed, the musk of the powders, the sourness of the toilet vinegar52 warmed him, made him more dazed. On the first floor, two corridors descended, turned abruptly, with doors of a suspiciously furnished hotel, painted yellow, bearing large white numbers; on the ground, the loose tiles made bumps in the settling of the old house. The Count ventured, glanced through a half-open door, saw a very dirty room, a suburban hairdresser's shop, furnished with two chairs, a mirror and a drawer board, blackened with filth. combs. A fellow in sweat, his shoulders smoking, was changing his linen there; while, in a similar room next door, a woman about to leave was putting on her gloves, her hair relaxed and wet, as if she had just taken a bath. But Fauchery called the Count, and the latter arrived at the second, when a ""nom de Dieu!"" furious came out of the corridor on the right; Mathilde, a little rag of an ingenue,53 had just broken her washbasin, from which the soapy water flowed as far as the landing. A box closed violently. Two women in corsets jumped across; another, the edge of his shirt in his teeth, appeared and ran away. Then there was laughter, a quarrel, a song started and suddenly stopped. Along the corridor, through the cracks, one could see corners of nudity, whiteness of skin, paleness of linen; two girls, very cheerful, showed each other their signs 54; one, very young, almost a child, had lifted her petticoats above her knees to sew up her trousers; while the dressers, seeing the two men, drew the curtains lightly, out of decency. It was the jostling at the end, the great cleaning of white and red, the city toilet resumed in the middle of a cloud of rice powder, an increase in the tawny smell blown by the swinging doors. On the third floor, Muffat abandoned himself to the intoxication which invaded him. The extras' dressing room was there; twenty women huddled together, a stampede of soaps and bottles of lavender water, the common room of a barrier house. Passing by, he heard, behind a closed door, a ferocious washing, a storm in a basin. And he was going up to the top floor, when he had the curiosity to risk another glance, through a peephole that had remained open: the room was empty, there was, under the blazing gas, only a forgotten chamber pot, in the middle of a mess of skirts dragging on the ground. This room was the last vision he carried away. Upstairs, on the fourth floor, he was suffocating. All the smells, all the flames came knocking there: the yellow ceiling seemed cooked, a lantern was burning in a russet mist. For a moment he held on to the iron railing, which he found warm with a living warmth, and he closed his eyes, and he drank in an aspiration all the woman's sex, which he still did not know and which beat his face.","As the count reached the foot of the stairs, he again felt a scorching breath at the back of his neck, that feminine odour coming from the dressing-rooms above, in a flood of light and noise; and now, at every step he mounted, the musky smell of the face powders, the tartness of the toilet-vinegars, heated him and stupefied him all the more. On the first landing two passages branched off with a sharp turn, and on to these several doors, painted yellow and bearing large white numbers, opened, giving to the place very much the appearance of an hotel of suspicious character. Several of the tiles composing the flooring were missing, and left so many holes. The count ventured along one of the passages, and glancing into a room, the door of which was only half closed, he beheld a wretched den, looking not unlike a barber’s shanty in some low neighbourhood, and furnished with two chairs, a looking-glass, and a dressing-table containing a drawer, blackened by the grease and scurf from the combs. A big fellow, covered with perspiration, and his shoulders steaming, was changing his underlinen; whilst in a similar room, situated close by, a woman, ready to leave, was putting on her gloves, with her hair all damp and uncurled, as though she had just come out of a bath. Fauchery here called to the count, and the latter reached the second storey just as a furiously uttered oath issued from the passage on the right. Mathilde, a smutty little thing, who personated virtuous persecuted damsels, had just broken her basin, the soapy water from which ran out on to the landing. A door was closed violently. Two women in their stays jumped across the passage; another, holding the tail of her chemise between her teeth, suddenly appeared, and as hastily made off. Then were heard a great deal of laughing, the sound of a quarrel, a song commenced and almost immediately interrupted. Through the cracks in the walls and the doors of the passage, one caught glimpses of nudity, rosy skins and white underlinen. Two girls, who were very merry, were showing one another the different marks on their bodies; a third, very young, almost a child, had lifted up her skirts, and was mending her drawers; whilst the dressers, seeing the two men, gently closed the curtains out of decency. It was the jostling at the end of the performance, the great washing off of white paint and rouge, the resumption of everyday dress in the midst of a cloud of face powder, an increase of the human odour which issued through the slamming doors. Arrived on the third storey, Muffat abandoned himself to the intoxication which was taking possession of him. The dressing-room of the female supers was there: twenty women heaped together, a confusion of soaps and bottles of lavender water, resembling the common room of a house of ill-fame in the suburbs. As he passed, he heard behind a closed door a great noise of washing, a storm in a basin. And he was moving on to the top storey, when he had the curiosity to look through a peep-hole left open in a door; the room was unoccupied, and all he could see by the light of the flaring gas was a familiar utensil forgotten amidst a pile of skirts thrown on the floor. This was the last vision he carried away with him. Up above, on the fourth storey, he felt as though he would choke. All the odours, all the heat congregated there. The yellow ceiling had a roasted appearance; a gas-lamp was burning in a sort of ruddy mist. For a moment he clung to the iron railing, which had the cool feeling of living flesh, and, closing his eyes, he drew a long breath, seeming by doing so to inhale all that pertained to the female sex he was still unacquainted with, although he was, as it were, enveloped by it.","When he reached the foot of the stairs the count once more felt the hot breath upon his neck and shoulders. As of old it was laden with the odor of women, wafted amid floods of light and sound from the dressing rooms above, and now with every upward step he took the musky scent of powders and the tart perfume of toilet vinegars heated and bewildered him more and more. On the first floor two corridors ran backward, branching sharply off and presenting a set of doors to view which were painted yellow and numbered with great white numerals in such a way as to suggest a hotel with a bad reputation. The tiles on the floor had been many of them unbedded, and the old house being in a state of subsidence, they stuck up like hummocks. The count dashed recklessly forward, glanced through a half-open door and saw a very dirty room which resembled a barber's shop in a poor part of the town. In was furnished with two chairs, a mirror and a small table containing a drawer which had been blackened by the grease from brushes and combs. A great perspiring fellow with smoking shoulders was changing his linen there, while in a similar room next door a woman was drawing on her gloves preparatory to departure. Her hair was damp and out of curl, as though she had just had a bath. But Fauchery began calling the count, and the latter was rushing up without delay when a furious ""damn!"" burst from the corridor on the right. Mathilde, a little drab of a miss, had just broken her washhand basin, the soapy water from which was flowing out to the stairhead. A dressing room door banged noisily. Two women in their stays skipped across the passage, and another, with the hem of her shift in her mouth, appeared and immediately vanished from view. Then followed a sound of laughter, a dispute, the snatch of a song which was suddenly broken off short. All along the passage naked gleams, sudden visions of white skin and wan underlinen were observable through chinks in doorways. Two girls were making very merry, showing each other their birthmarks. One of them, a very young girl, almost a child, had drawn her skirts up over her knees in order to sew up a rent in her drawers, and the dressers, catching sight of the two men, drew some curtains half to for decency's sake. The wild stampede which follows the end of a play had already begun, the grand removal of white paint and rouge, the reassumption amid clouds of rice powder of ordinary attire. The strange animal scent came in whiffs of redoubled intensity through the lines of banging doors. On the third story Muffat abandoned himself to the feeling of intoxication which was overpowering him. For the chorus girls' dressing room was there, and you saw a crowd of twenty women and a wild display of soaps and flasks of lavender water. The place resembled the common room in a slum lodging house. As he passed by he heard fierce sounds of washing behind a closed door and a perfect storm raging in a washhand basin. And as he was mounting up to the topmost story of all, curiosity led him to risk one more little peep through an open loophole. The room was empty, and under the flare of the gas a solitary chamber pot stood forgotten among a heap of petticoats trailing on the floor. This room afforded him his ultimate impression. Upstairs on the fourth floor he was well-nigh suffocated. All the scents, all the blasts of heat, had found their goal there. The yellow ceiling looked as if it had been baked, and a lamp burned amid fumes of russet-colored fog. For some seconds he leaned upon the iron balustrade which felt warm and damp and well- nigh human to the touch. And he shut his eyes and drew a long breath and drank in the sexual atmosphere of the place. Hitherto he had been utterly ignorant of it, but now it beat full in his face.","As he reached the foot of the stairs the count had again felt a fiery gust of air striking the back of his neck and bringing down the smell of women from the dressing-rooms in a wave of noise and light. Now with every step upwards he could feel the musky perfume of powder and the vinegary tartness of toiletries making him hotter and hotter and increasingly bewildered. Leading off the first floor were two crooked corridors with yellow doors bearing large white numbers, like a shady lodging-house; and as the old building had subsided the tiles had lifted, making the floor uneven. The count ventured into the passage, cast a glance through a half-open door, and saw the sort of barber’s booth you find in working-class slums, furnished with a couple of chairs, a mirror, and a tray with a shelf encrusted with the black grime of greasy combs. In the room a young man, sturdy and sweating, with steam rising from his shoulders, was changing his underclothes. In a similar room next door a woman was putting on her gloves, about to leave; with her damp, lank hair she looked as if she’d just had a bath. But Fauchery called out and the count was hurrying to catch up when an angry shout of ‘Oh shit!’ came from the corridor on the right : Mathilde, a little slut who played ingénue parts, had broken her wash-basin and a flood of soapy water was pouring out over the landing. A dressing-room door slammed violently. Two women in their corsets leapt across the passage. Another woman appeared holding the top of her shift between her teeth and scuttled away. There was laughter, a squabble; someone started singing and stopped abruptly. Along the passage, through the cracks, there were little glimpses of bare flesh, white skin, pale underwear. Two very lively girls were showing each other their birthmarks; one of them, barely more than a child, had lifted her petticoats up above her knees to mend her knickers. Seeing the two men, the dressers drew the curtains to, for the sake of propriety. The final scramble was taking place, everybody cleaning off all the rouge and grease-paint, putting on their clothes, in a cloud of rice-powder, with the doors puffing out even more musky gusts of perfume as they slammed. On the third floor Muffat abandoned himself to his overpowering feeling of intoxication. Up here were the extras’ dressing-rooms: twenty women on top of each other, a crazy clutter of bars of soap and bottles of lavender-water, rather like the room shared by the women of a cheap brothel. Behind a closed door there came the sound of a wild gush of water, a storm in a wash-basin. On his way up to the top floor, he was impelled by curiosity to risk one more quick look through an open spy-hole: the room was empty, its floor littered with skirts, in the midst of which the glare of the gaslight revealed a chamber-pot left by someone. With this final vision in his eyes he continued on his way up. On the fourth floor, he found it hardly possible to breathe: every smell, every scrap of heat, was concentrated at the top: the yellow of the ceiling seemed to have been baked on, a lamp was burning in a reddish haze. For a second he had to hold tightly on to the iron banister, which felt warm to the touch like a living creature. He shut his eyes and inhaled a breath in which the whole sexuality of women was distilled, something which he had never before met and which struck him full in the face."
"Toutefois, après de nouveaux saluts, comme les bouteilles étaient vides, les comédiens montèrent s’habiller. Bosc, ayant trempé sa barbe de champagne, venait de l’ôter, et sous cette barbe vénérable l’ivrogne avait brusquement reparu, avec sa face ravagée et bleuie de vieil acteur tombé dans le vin35. On l’entendit, au pied de l’escalier, qui disait à Fontan, de sa voix de rogomme36, en parlant du prince :","However, after new greetings, as the bottles were empty, the actors went upstairs to get dressed. Bosc, having soaked his beard in champagne, had just taken it off, and beneath that venerable beard the drunkard had suddenly reappeared, with his ravaged and blue face of an old actor who had fallen into wine. He was heard, at the foot of the stairs, saying to Fontan, in his rogum's voice,36 speaking of the prince:","Nevertheless, as the bottles were empty, the actors went up to dress, after again bowing. Bosc, having soaked his beard with champagne, had taken it off, and beneath the venerable appendage the drunkard had suddenly reappeared, with the diseased and purple face of an old actor who had taken to drink. He was heard at the foot of the stair-case saying to Fontan, in his hoarse voice, in allusion to the prince:","However, as the bottles were now empty, the comedians went upstairs to dress after yet another interchange of civilities. Bosc, having dipped his beard in the champagne, had taken it off, and under his venerable disguise the drunkard had suddenly reappeared. His was the haggard, empurpled face of the old actor who has taken to drink. At the foot of the stairs he was heard remarking to Fontan in his boozy voice:","Nevertheless, as the bottles were empty, the actors bowed their way out and went upstairs to get changed. Bosc’s venerable beard had got soaked in champagne and he had to take it off, thereby revealing his ravaged purple face, a drunken old actor sinking into alcoholism.

He came back and with a shudder muttered simply:

"— Pourquoi donc ? demanda-t-elle, sérieuse, un peu dégrisée.","- Why is that ? she asked, serious, a little sobered.","“But why not?” asked she, serious, and slightly sobered.","""Why not?"" she asked, looking serious and slightly sobered.","‘Why impossible?’ she asked, sobering up a little."
"Nana la fit taire d’un froncement de sourcil, parce que d’autres femmes étaient là, en robe de chambre, sans linge, les cheveux tombés et blancs de peluches. Le matin, toutes les filles du quartier, à peine l’homme de la veille mis à la porte, venaient faire leurs provisions, les yeux gros de sommeil, traînant des savates dans la mauvaise humeur et la fatigue d’une nuit d’embêtements. De chaque rue du carrefour, il en descendait vers le marché, de très pâles, jeunes encore, charmantes d’abandon, d’affreuses, vieilles et ballonnées, lâchant leur peau, se fichant d’être vues ainsi, en dehors des heures de travail ; pendant que, sur les trottoirs, les passants se retournaient, sans qu’une seule daignât sourire, toutes affairées, avec des airs dédaigneux de ménagères pour qui les hommes n’existaient plus. Justement, comme Satin payait sa botte de radis, un jeune homme, quelque employé attardé, lui jeta un : « Bonsoir, chérie », au passage. Du coup, elle se redressa, elle eut une dignité de reine offensée, en disant :","Nana silenced her with a frown, because other women were there, in dressing gowns, without linen, their hair down and white with fluff. In the morning, all the girls in the neighborhood, barely the man from the night before being thrown out, came to buy their provisions, their eyes heavy with sleep, dragging their slippers in the bad mood and the fatigue of a night of hassles. . From each street at the crossroads, there were some going down towards the market, some very pale, still young, charmingly abandoned, some hideous, old and bloated, letting go of their skin, not caring to be seen like this, outside the hours of work ; while, on the sidewalks, the passers-by turned around, without a single one deigning to smile, all busy, with the disdainful air of housewives for whom men no longer existed. Just as Satin was paying for her bunch of radishes, a young man, some belated clerk, threw a ""Good evening, darling"" at her as she passed. Suddenly she sat up, she had the dignity of an offended queen, saying:","Nana frowned at her to make her leave off, because there were some other women there, women in dressing-gowns, and who did not appear to have any underclothes on, whose hair was all dishevelled and whose faces were smothered with powder. Every morning all the loose women of the neighbourhood, having scarcely got rid of the men picked up the night before, came to make their purchases, dragging their old shoes over the pavement, their eyes heavy with want of sleep, and in the bad temper caused by the fatigue of a night of dissipation. Down every street leading to the market they could be seen coming, all looking very pale, some quite young girls most seductive in appearance, others regular old hags, both fat and flabby, not minding in the least to be seen thus outside their business hours; whilst the passers-by might turn to look at them without even one of them deigning to smile, for they were all in too much of a hurry for that, and went about their errands with the disdainful airs of thrifty women who have no dealings with men whatever. Just as Satin was paying for her bunch of radishes, a young man, some clerk who was late, called to her as he passed, “Good-morning, darling.” She at once drew herself up with the dignity of an offended queen, saying,","Nana knitted her brows as a sign that she was to hold her tongue, for they were surrounded by other women who wore dressing gowns and were without linen, while their disheveled tresses were white with fluff. In the morning, when the man picked up overnight had been newly dismissed, all the courtesans of the quarter were wont to come marketing here, their eyes heavy with sleep, their feet in old down- at-heel shoes and themselves full of the weariness and ill humor entailed by a night of boredom. From the four converging streets they came down into the market, looking still rather young in some cases and very pale and charming in their utter unconstraint; in others, hideous and old with bloated faces and peeling skin. The latter did not the least mind being seen thus outside working hours, and not one of them deigned to smile when the passers-by on the sidewalk turned round to look at them. Indeed, they were all very full of business and wore a disdainful expression, as became good housewives for whom men had ceased to exist. Just as Satin, for instance, was paying for her bunch of radishes a young man, who might have been a shop-boy going late to his work, threw her a passing greeting: ""Good morning, duckie."" She straightened herself up at once and with the dignified manner becoming an offended queen remarked:","Nana gave her a frown to tell her to be quiet, because there were other women there, with their hair hanging loose and covered in fluff, still not dressed under their dressing-gowns; in the morning all the tarts in the neighbourhood, as soon as they’d got rid of the man they’d spent the night with, would come and do their shopping, bleary-eyed and down-at-heel, in a foul temper and tired out from the various hassles of the previous night. They would all pour in from every street leading to the square, looking very pale, some still young and charming and high-spirited, others blowsy old hags exposing their flabby flesh to all and sundry, completely unconcerned at being seen like that outside working hours. On the pavement the passers-by kept turning to look at them, while none of them deigned even to smile, like busy, scornful housewives for whom men had momentarily ceased to exist. And indeed, when a young office worker called out ‘Hello, ducks!’ as he went by, late for work, Satin, who was paying for her bunch of radishes, drew herself up disapprovingly like an offended queen and said:"

"Et son sourire était adorable, confus et soumis, comme si elle eût désespéré de ce baiser et qu’elle fût heureuse de l’avoir reçu. Mais elle ne pouvait pas, ni le soir, ni le lendemain.

He pulled a bag out of the pocket of his frock-coat with the perfect discretion of a man of the world offering a present to a lady friend; all the same, each time he sent in his account he added the price of the sweets to his bill. Nana put the bag between her knees and started munching, twisting her head in accordance with Francis’ directions."

His body was so knotty, so reduced, that the blue jacket with white sleeves seemed to cover a piece of wood.","And she declared him to be exquisitely ugly. All jockeys struck her as looking idiotic, doubtless, she said, because they were prevented from growing bigger.

His body was knotty and so reduced in size that his blue jacket with its white sleeves looked as if it had been thrown over a lay figure.","She thought he was jolly ugly. To her all the jockeys looked cretinous, perhaps because they were deliberately stunted in growth.

"Pourtant, elle se calma. Maintenant, il s’en irait. Après avoir passé une chemise de nuit garnie de dentelle, elle vint s’asseoir par terre, devant le feu. C'était sa place favorite. Comme elle le questionnait de nouveau sur la chronique de Fauchery, Muffat répondit vaguement, désireux d’éviter une scène. D’ailleurs, elle déclara qu’elle avait Fauchery quelque part.

"La grosse affaire fut de monter la maison14. Nana avait bien Zoé, cette fille dévouée à sa fortune, qui depuis des mois attendait tranquillement ce brusque lançage, certaine de son flair. Maintenant, Zoé triomphait, maîtresse de l’hôtel, faisant sa pelote, tout en servant madame le plus honnêtement possible. Mais une femme de chambre ne suffisait plus. Il fallait un maître d’hôtel, un cocher, un concierge, une cuisinière. D’autre part, il s’agissait d’installer les écuries. Alors, Labordette se rendit fort utile, en se chargeant des courses qui ennuyaient le comte. Il maquignonna 15 l'achat des chevaux, il courut les carrossiers, guida le choix de la jeune femme, qu’on rencontrait à son bras chez les fournisseurs. Même Labordette amena les domestiques : Charles, un grand gaillard de cocher, qui sortait de chez le duc de Corbreuse ; Julien, un petit maître d’hôtel tout frisé, l’air souriant ; et un ménage, dont la femme, Victorine, était cuisinière, et dont l’homme, François, fut pris comme concierge et valet de pied. Ce dernier, en culotte courte, poudré, portant la livrée de Nana, bleu clair et galon d’argent, recevait les visiteurs dans le vestibule. C'était d’une tenue 16 et d’une correction princières.","The big business was building the house. Nana had Zoe, that girl devoted to her fortune, who for months had been quietly waiting for this sudden launch, certain of her flair. Now Zoe was triumphant, mistress of the hotel, playing her ball, while serving Madame as honestly as possible. But a maid was no longer enough. It needed a butler, a coachman, a concierge, a cook. On the other hand, it was a question of installing the stables. Then Labordette made himself very useful by taking charge of the errands which bored the Count. He haggled over the purchase of horses, he ran to the coachbuilders, guided the choice of the young woman, whom one met on his arm at the suppliers. Even Labordette brought the servants: Charles, a big fellow of a coachman, who had just left the Duc de Corbreuse; Julien, a little curly haired butler, looking smiling; and a household, whose wife, Victorine, was a cook, and whose husband, François, was taken on as concierge and footman. The latter, in short pants, powdered, wearing Nana's livery, light blue and silver braid, received visitors in the vestibule. It was a dress 16 and a princely correction.","The great matter was to secure servants for the establishment. Nana still had Zoé, that girl who was so devoted to her fortune, and who for months past, confident in her instinct, had been quietly awaiting this new start in life. Now, Zoé triumphed—mistress of the household, and feathering her own nest, yet looking after madame ’s interests as honestly as possible. But a lady’s maid was not sufficient. A butler, a coachman, a concierge, a cook, were required; besides which, it was necessary to furnish the stables. Then Labordette made himself very useful, in undertaking any commissions that bothered the count. He bargained for the horses, went to the coachbuilders, and assisted the young woman, who was continually met with on his arm at the different dealers, in her selections. Labordette even engaged the servants—Charles, a tall coachman who had been in the service of the Duke de Corbreuse; Julien, a little butler with curly hair and always smiling; and a married couple, of whom the woman, Victorine, was cook, while the man, François, acted as concierge and footman. The latter, with powdered hair and knee breeches, and wearing Nana’s livery, light blue and silver lace, received the visitors in the vestibule. Everything was done in princely style.","The furnishing of the house was a most important undertaking. Nana certainly had Zoe with her, that girl so devoted to her fortunes. For months she had been tranquilly awaiting this abrupt, new departure, as became a woman who was certain of her powers of prescience, and now she was triumphant; she was mistress of the house and was putting by a round sum while serving Madame as honestly as possible. But a solitary lady's maid was no longer sufficient. A butler, a coachman, a porter and a cook were wanted. Besides, it was necessary to fill the stables. It was then that Labordette made himself most useful. He undertook to perform all sorts of errands which bored the count; he made a comfortable job of the purchase of horses; he visited the coachbuilders; he guided the young woman in her choice of things. She was to be met with at the shops, leaning on his arm. Labordette even got in the servants-- Charles, a great, tall coachman, who had been in service with the Duc de Corbreuse; Julien, a little, smiling, much-becurled butler, and a married couple, of whom the wife Victorine became cook while the husband Francois was taken on as porter and footman. The last mentioned in powder and breeches wore Nana's livery, which was a sky-blue one adorned with silver lace, and he received visitors in the hall. The whole thing was princely in the correctness of its style.","The important thing was to get domestic staff. Nana had, of course, the ever-faithful Zoé, firmly attached to her star and who’d been waiting for months to see her mistress’s meteoric rise, quietly confident in her flair. Zoé was now exultantly taking charge of the household, feathering her own nest while serving her mistress as honestly as possible. But a chambermaid was no longer adequate; a butler, a coachman, a caretaker, and a cook were obvious necessities. And the stables needed organizing, too. Labordette proved invaluable, running errands that the count found boring. He haggled over the price of the horses, went the rounds of the coach-builders, and helped the young woman to make her choice; she could be seen taking his arm as they called on the various suppliers. Labordette even recruited the servants: a tall, sturdy young fellow by the name of Charles as the coachman, who’d been in service with the Duke of Corbreuse; a smiling, curly-headed little butler called Jules; and a married couple, the wife Victorine as cook and the husband François as caretaker and footman. The latter, in breeches, with powdered hair and wearing Nana’s livery of pale blue, silver-laced, received callers in the vestibule. The whole style and get-up were princely."

"Le comte échangea une poignée de main avec le journaliste, tandis qu’une vive explication avait lieu entre Blanche et Lucy. Elles bouchaient le passage de leurs jupes chargées de volants, l’une en bleu, l’autre en rose, et le nom de Nana revenait sur leurs lèvres, si aigu, que le monde les écoutait. Le comte de Vandeuvres emmena Blanche. Mais, à présent, comme un écho, Nana sonnait aux quatre coins du vestibule sur un ton plus haut, dans un désir accru par l’attente. On ne commençait donc pas ? Les hommes tiraient leurs montres, des retardataires sautaient de leurs voitures avant qu’elles fussent arrêtées, des groupes quittaient le trottoir, où les promeneurs, lentement, traversaient la nappe20 de gaz restée vide, en allongeant le cou pour voir dans le théâtre. Un gamin qui arrivait en sifflant, se planta devant une affiche, à la porte ; puis il cria : « Ohé ! Nana ! » d’une voix de rogomme21, et poursuivit son chemin, déhanché, traînant ses savates. Un rire avait couru. Des messieurs très bien répétèrent : « Nana, ohé ! Nana ! » On s’écrasait, une querelle éclatait au contrôle, une clameur grandissait, faite du bourdonnement des voix appelant Nana, exigeant Nana, dans un de ces coups d’esprit bête et de brutale sensualité qui passent sur les foules.","The count exchanged a handshake with the journalist, while a heated explanation took place between Blanche and Lucy. They blocked the passage of their skirts laden with flounces, one in blue, the other in pink, and the name of Nana returned to their lips, so shrill that the world listened to them. The Comte de Vandeuvres took Blanche away. But now, like an echo, Nana rang from the four corners of the vestibule in a higher tone, in a desire heightened by expectation. So we weren't starting? Men pulled out their watches, latecomers jumped out of their cars before they were stopped, groups left the sidewalk, where passers-by slowly crossed the empty gas table, stretching their necks to see into the theatre. A boy who arrived whistling, stood in front of a poster at the door; then he shouted, “Hey! Nana! in the voice of a rogum21, and went on his way, swaying his hips, dragging his slippers. A laugh ran. Very nice gentlemen repeated: “Nana, ahoy! Nana! They crashed, a quarrel broke out at the checkpoint, a clamor grew, made up of the hum of voices calling Nana, demanding Nana, in one of those bursts of stupid wit and brutal sensuality that pass over crowds.","The count shook hands with the journalist, whilst a lively discussion took place between Lucy and Blanche. They quite blocked up the entry with their skirts covered with flounces, one in pink and the other in blue, and Nana’s name fell from their lips so frequently that the crowd lingered to listen. The count at length led Blanche away, but Nana’s name did not cease to resound from the four corners of the vestibule in louder and more eager tones. Would they never begin? The men pulled out their watches, late comers leaped from their carriages before they really drew up, and the groups left the pavement, whilst the passers-by, as they slowly crossed the stream of light, stretched their necks to see what was going on in the theatre. A street urchin who came up whistling, stood for a moment before one of the posters at the door; then, in a drunken voice shouted out, “Oh, my! Nana!” and reeled on his way, dragging his old shoes along the asphalt. People laughed, and several well-dressed gentlemen repeated, “Nana! Oh, my! Nana!” The crush was tremendous. A quarrel broke out at the box-office, the cries for Nana increased; one of those stupid fits of brutal excitement common to crowds had taken possession of this mass of people.","The count and the journalist shook hands, while Blanche and Lucy entered into a brisk, mutual explanation. One of them in blue, the other in rose-pink, they stood blocking the way with their deeply flounced skirts, and Nana's name kept repeating itself so shrilly in their conversation that people began to listen to them. The Count de Vandeuvres carried Blanche off. But by this time Nana's name was echoing more loudly than ever round the four walls of the entrance hall amid yearnings sharpened by delay. Why didn't the play begin? The men pulled out their watches; late-comers sprang from their conveyances before these had fairly drawn up; the groups left the sidewalk, where the passers-by were crossing the now-vacant space of gaslit pavement, craning their necks, as they did so, in order to get a peep into the theater. A street boy came up whistling and planted himself before a notice at the door, then cried out, ""Woa, Nana!"" in the voice of a tipsy man and hied on his way with a rolling gait and a shuffling of his old boots. A laugh had arisen at this. Gentlemen of unimpeachable appearance repeated: ""Nana, woa, Nana!"" People were crushing; a dispute arose at the ticket office, and there was a growing clamor caused by the hum of voices calling on Nana, demanding Nana in one of those accesses of silly facetiousness and sheer animalism which pass over mobs.","The count shook the journalist’s hand while Blanche and Lucy launched into a lively altercation, blocking the way with their heavily flounced dresses, one blue, the other pink. The name ‘Nana’ was coming up in such shrill tones that people started listening. Count de Vandeuvres took Blanche away; but now curiosity had become even keener, and Nana’s name was being taken up more and more loudly all round the foyer. Weren’t they ever going to begin? Men were pulling out their watches, late-comers were leaping out of their carriages even before they stopped, groups of people were coming in from outside where passers-by were craning their necks to look in as they dawdled along the now-deserted stretch of pavement under the glare of the gas-jets. A down-at-heel young tough came up whistling, stopped at the entrance in front of a poster, called out: ‘Olé Nana!’ in a husky, drunken voice, and went swaying off along the boulevard. People laughed and some very distinguished-looking gentlemen repeated: ‘Olé Nana!’ There was a lot of jostling, a row broke out at the ticket-office, the buzz of voices was becoming an uproar as, in a heady wave of crude sensuality and stupidity typical of crowds, everybody began clamouring for Nana to appear."

"Cependant, depuis huit jours, dans cette nécessité immédiate de trouver les cent mille francs de Labordette, Muffat avait imaginé un seul expédient, devant lequel il reculait. C’était de vendre les Bordes, une magnifique propriété, estimée à un demi-million, qu’un oncle venait de léguer à la comtesse. Seulement, il fallait la signature de celle-ci, qui, elle-même, par son contrat, ne pouvait aliéner la propriété, sans l’autorisation du comte. La veille enfin, il avait résolu de causer de cette signature avec sa femme. Et tout croulait, jamais à cette heure il n’accepterait un pareil compromis. Cette pensée enfonçait davantage le coup affreux de l’adultère. Il comprenait bien ce que Nana demandait ; car, dans l’abandon croissant qui le poussait à la mettre de moitié en tout, il s’était plaint de sa situation, il lui avait confié son ennui au sujet de cette signature de la comtesse6.","However, for a week past, in this immediate necessity of finding Labordette's hundred thousand francs, Muffat had devised a single expedient, before which he recoiled. It was to sell the Bordes, a magnificent property, estimated at half a million, which an uncle had just bequeathed to the Countess. Only, it required the signature of this one, which, itself, by its contract, could not alienate the property, without the authorization of the count. Finally, the day before, he had resolved to discuss this signature with his wife. And everything was crumbling, never at this hour would he accept such a compromise. This thought sank deeper the dreadful blow of adultery. He understood well what Nana was asking; for, in the growing abandonment which impelled him to put half in everything, he had complained of his situation, he had confided to her his annoyance about this signature of the Countess.","However, during the last week, in view of the necessity of immediately finding the hundred thousand francs for the bill, Muffat had only been able to think of one expedient, from which he recoiled. It was to sell a magnificent estate called Les Bordes, estimated at half-a-million, and which the countess had recently inherited from an uncle. Only, he needed her assent, and she also, by her marriage contract, could not dispose of it without his. The night before he had made up his mind to ask his wife for her consent. But now his plans were all upset, he could never accept such a compromise knowing what he did. This thought made the blow he had received all the harder. He understood what it was that Nana wished; for, in the increasing constraint that prompted him to confide in her regarding everything, he had complained about the difficulty he was in, he had told her how anxious he was to get the countess’s consent.","Nevertheless, for the last week, under the immediate necessity of finding Labordette's hundred thousand francs, Muffat had been able to hit on but one expedient, from which he recoiled. This was that he should sell the Bordes, a magnificent property valued at half a million, which an uncle had recently left the countess. However, her signature was necessary, and she herself, according to the terms of the deed, could not alienate the property without the count's authorization. The day before he had indeed resolved to talk to his wife about this signature. And now everything was ruined; at such a moment he would never accept of such a compromise. This reflection added bitterness to the frightful disgrace of the adultery. He fully understood what Nana was asking for, since in that ever- growing self-abandonment which prompted him to put her in possession of all his secrets, he had complained to her of his position and had confided to her the tiresome difficulty he was in with regard to the signature of the countess.","However, during this last week, faced by the necessity of laying hands on the hundred thousand francs for Labordette without delay, Muffat had hit upon one final scheme which he viewed with extreme reluctance, namely the sale of Les Bordes, a magnificent property with an estimated value of half-a-million francs which had recently been bequeathed to the countess by an uncle. But this sale required the countess’s written agreement, and under the terms of her marriage contract she herself couldn’t dispose of the property without the count’s authorization. He had in fact been intending to raise the question of her agreement with his wife yesterday. And now all his plans were being dashed; in the present situation he couldn’t possibly accept that sort of compromise. This thought brought home his wife’s adultery to him even more forcibly; and he could quite understand the point of Nana’s remarks, for in her increasing domination of him which had led him to keep nothing from her, he had been bewailing his situation and admitting the difficulty he was facing to get the countess to sign."

"Cette parole sembla décider la jeune femme. Elle quitta la cuisine à regret, ce refuge tiède où l’on pouvait causer et s’abandonner dans l’odeur du café, chauffant sur un reste de braise.

"Puis, là, dans cette chambre, un vertige le grisait. Il oubliait tout, la cohue des mâles qui la traversaient, le deuil qui en fermait la porte. Dehors, parfois, au grand air de la rue, il pleurait de honte et de révolte, en jurant de ne jamais y rentrer. Et, dès que la portière retombait, il était repris, il se sentait fondre à la tiédeur de la pièce, la chair pénétrée d’un parfum, envahie d’un désir voluptueux d’anéantissement. Lui, dévot, habitué aux extases des chapelles riches, retrouvait exactement ses sensations de croyant, lorsque, agenouillé sous un vitrail, il succombait à l’ivresse des orgues et des encensoirs. La femme le possédait avec le despotisme jaloux d’un Dieu de colère, le terrifiant, lui donnant des secondes de joies aiguës comme des spasmes, pour des heures d’affreux tourments, des visions d’enfer et d’éternels supplices. C'étaient les mêmes balbutiements, les mêmes prières et les mêmes désespoirs, surtout les mêmes humilités d’une créature maudite, écrasée sous la boue 47 de son origine. Ses désirs d’homme, ses besoins d’une âme, se confondaient, semblaient monter, du fond obscur de son être, ainsi qu’un seul épanouissement du tronc de la vie. Il s’abandonnait à la force de l’amour et de la foi, dont le double levier soulève le monde. Et toujours, malgré les luttes de sa raison, cette chambre de Nana le frappait de folie, il disparaissait en grelottant dans la toute-puissance du sexe, comme il s’évanouissait devant l’inconnu du vaste ciel.","Then, there, in this room, a dizziness intoxicated him. He forgot everything, the throng of males crossing it, the mourning that closed the door. Outside, sometimes, in the open air of the street, he wept with shame and revolt, swearing never to return. And, as soon as the door fell, he was taken back, he felt himself melting in the warmth of the room, his flesh penetrated by a perfume, invaded by a voluptuous desire for annihilation. He, a devotee, accustomed to the ecstasies of the rich chapels, found exactly his feelings of believer, when, kneeling under a stained glass window, he succumbed to the intoxication of the organs and the censers. The woman possessed him with the jealous despotism of an angry God, terrifying him, giving him seconds of acute joys like spasms, for hours of terrible torments, visions of hell and eternal tortures. It was the same stammering, the same prayers and the same despair, above all the same humility of a cursed creature, crushed under the mud of its origin. His desires as a man, his needs as a soul, merged, seemed to rise from the dark depths of his being, like a single blossoming from the trunk of life. He abandoned himself to the force of love and faith, the double lever of which lifts the world. And always, despite the struggles of his reason, this room of Nana struck him with madness, he disappeared shivering in the omnipotence of sex, as he fainted before the unknown of the vast sky.","Then in that room an unconquerable feeling intoxicated him. He forgot all—the mob of other men who passed through it, the mourning that barred the door. Outside, at times, in the open air of the street, he would shed tears of shame and indignation, and swear never to return there; and the moment he had passed the threshold, he was recaptured. He felt his will give way in the warmth of the apartment; his flesh penetrated with a perfume, overpowered by a voluptuous desire of annihilation. He, devout and used to the rapturous feelings enkindled by the contemplation of gorgeous shrines, experienced exactly the same sensations of a believer, as when, kneeling in some church, he became entranced by the sounds of the organ and the perfume of the incense. The woman ruled him with the jealous despotism of a god of anger, terrifying him, giving him seconds of joy, acute as spasms, for hours of frightful torments, of visions of hell and everlasting damnation. It was always the same stutterings, the same prayers, and the same despondencies, especially the same humilities of an accursed creature crushed beneath the mud of his origin. The desires of his flesh, the requirements of his soul, mingled and seemed to rise from the obscure depths of his being, like a single blossom of the tree of life. He abandoned himself to the power of love and faith, whose double lever animates the world. And always, in spite of the struggles of his reason, Nana’s room filled him with madness. He shiveringly succumbed to the all-powerfulness of her sex, the same as he felt lost before the vast unknown of heaven.","But in the bedroom within he would grow dizzy and intoxicated and would forget everything--the mob of men which constantly crossed it, the sign of mourning which barred its door. Outside, in the open air of the street, he would weep occasionally out of sheer shame and disgust and would vow never to enter the room again. And the moment the portiere had closed behind him he was under the old influence once more and felt his whole being melting in the damp warm air of the place, felt his flesh penetrated by a perfume, felt himself overborne by a voluptuous yearning for self-annihilation. Pious and habituated to ecstatic experiences in sumptuous chapels, he there re-encountered precisely the same mystical sensations as when he knelt under some painted window and gave way to the intoxication of organ music and incense. Woman swayed him as jealously and despotically as the God of wrath, terrifying him, granting him moments of delight, which were like spasms in their keenness, in return for hours filled with frightful, tormenting visions of hell and eternal tortures. In Nana's presence, as in church, the same stammering accents were his, the same prayers and the same fits of despair--nay, the same paroxysms of humility peculiar to an accursed creature who is crushed down in the mire from whence he has sprung. His fleshly desires, his spiritual needs, were confounded together and seemed to spring from the obscure depths of his being and to bear but one blossom on the tree of his existence. He abandoned himself to the power of love and of faith, those twin levers which move the world. And despite all the struggles of his reason this bedroom of Nana's always filled him with madness, and he would sink shuddering under the almighty dominion of sex, just as he would swoon before the vast unknown of heaven.","Then, as soon as he was in the bedroom, his head would swim, he’d forget everything, the males scrambling to come in, the tragedy still lurking in the doorway. Sometimes, in the fresh air outside in the street, he would rebel and shed tears of shame, swearing he’d never go back in there. Yet as soon as the door-curtain closed behind him he would fall under her spell, he could feel himself dissolving in the gentle warmth of her room, his body impregnated by her scent, thrilling with lust and a desire for obliteration. This pious man whose experiences of heavenly bliss normally occurred in splendid chapels was gripped here by the same religious ecstasy as when he surrendered to the exaltation of solemn organ music or the scent of incense, kneeling in front of a stained-glass window. This woman possessed him, body and soul, with the despotic power of a jealous God of wrath, terrifying him and offering him brief spasms of joy followed by hours of torment, of fearful visions of hell and eternal damnation and suffering. He would stammer the same prayers, feeling the desperation and above all the humility of a mortal man cursed and crushed by the burden of his earthy origin. The desires of his flesh and the needs of his soul had become intertwined and seemed to be springing from the depths of his being, in the same way as the tree of life opens out into a single blossom. He capitulated to love and religion, those two mainsprings of human existence; but the madness which overcame him in Nana’s bedroom always conquered the struggles and scruples of his reason; he would plunge trembling into the all-powerful maw of her sex in the same way as he collapsed overwhelmed by the mystery of the almighty heavens."

"Dès le second vers, on se regardait dans la salle. Était-ce une plaisanterie, quelque gageure53 de Bordenave ? Jamais on n’avait entendu une voix aussi fausse, menée avec moins de méthode. Son directeur la jugeait bien, elle chantait comme une seringue. Et elle ne savait même pas se tenir en scène, elle jetait les mains en avant, dans un balancement de tout son corps, qu’on trouva peu convenable et disgracieux. Des oh ! oh ! s’élevaient déjà du parterre et des petites places, on sifflotait, lorsqu’une voix de jeune coq en train de muer, aux fauteuils d’orchestre, lança avec conviction :","From the second verse, we were looking at each other in the room. Was it a joke, some challenge53 from Bordenave? Never had we heard such a false voice, conducted with less method. Her director judged her well, she sang like a syringe. And she didn't even know how to hold herself on stage, she threw her hands forward, in a swaying of her whole body, which people found unseemly and ungraceful. Ohs! Oh ! were already rising from the pit and the small squares, people were whistling, when the voice of a cockerel in the process of molting, from the orchestra seats, launched with conviction:","At the second line, people exchanged glances of wonder. Was this a jest on the part of Bordenave, or a wager? Never had so false a voice and so poor a method been heard. The manager had spoken truly when he said that she had no more voice than a squirt. Nor did she know how to stand or move on the stage. She threw her arms forward and wriggled her body about in a manner that was considered scarcely proper and very ungraceful. The pit was beginning to murmur, in fact a few hisses were heard, when suddenly from the orchestra stalls a voice, resembling that of a young cock moulting, exclaimed aloud in a tone of intense conviction:","From the second verse onward people looked at each other all over the house. Was this some jest, some wager on Bordenave's part? Never had a more tuneless voice been heard or one managed with less art. Her manager judged of her excellently; she certainly sang like a squirt. Nay, more, she didn't even know how to deport herself on the stage: she thrust her arms in front of her while she swayed her whole body to and fro in a manner which struck the audience as unbecoming and disagreeable. Cries of ""Oh, oh!"" were already rising in the pit and the cheap places. There was a sound of whistling, too, when a voice in the stalls, suggestive of a molting cockerel, cried out with great conviction:","She had barely reached the second line before the audience started exchanging glances. Was this a joke, one of Bordenave’s calculated risks? They’d never heard a worse-trained voice, nor one singing more out of tune. Her manager had summed her up exactly: she sang like a corncrake. And she didn’t even know how to hold herself on the stage—she was flinging her arms about in front of herself and swaying in a way that seemed both graceless and inappropriate. Oohs and ahs were coming from the pit and the cheaper seats, and people began quietly hissing; then a cracked voice, like a moulting cockerel’s, in the orchestra stalls called out enthusiastically:"
"La Tricon parla tout de suite du temps qu’il faisait, un temps sec par lequel il était bon de marcher. Elle avait encore quatre ou cinq personnes à voir. Et elle s’en alla en consultant un petit calepin. Restée seule, Nana parut soulagée.

She still had four or five people to see. And she went off, consulting a little notebook. Left alone, Nana seemed relieved.

Gradually her eyes closed, she smiled at the idea of dressing Louiset nicely the next day; while, in the sleep that resumed her, her feverish dream of the whole night, a prolonged rumble of bravos, returned like a basso continuo, and lulled her weariness.","Madame Tricon immediately began to talk of the weather; it was very dry, and good for walking. She had still to call on four or five persons; and off she went, after consulting a little note-book. Nana, left alone, felt a weight lifted off her mind.

Little by little her eyes closed, and she lay smiling at the thought of dressing Louiset prettily on the following day, while in the slumber into which she once more sank last night's long, feverish dream of endlessly rolling applause returned like a sustained accompaniment to music and gently soothed her lassitude.","Tricon immediately moved on to the weather, which was dry and good for walking.

"À neuf heures, la salle du théâtre des Variétés1 était encore vide. Quelques personnes, au balcon et à l’orchestre, attendaient, perdues parmi les fauteuils de velours grenat, dans le petit jour du lustre à demi-feux. Une ombre noyait la grande tache rouge du rideau ; et pas un bruit ne venait de la scène, la rampe éteinte, les pupitres des musiciens débandés. En haut seulement, à la troisième galerie, autour de la rotonde du plafond où des femmes et des enfants nus prenaient leur volée dans un ciel verdi par le gaz, des appels et des rires sortaient d’un brouhaha continu de voix, des têtes coiffées de bonnets et de casquettes 2 s'étageaient sous les larges baies rondes, encadrées d’or. Par moments, une ouvreuse se montrait, affairée, des coupons à la main, poussant devant elle un monsieur et une dame qui s’asseyaient, l’homme en habit, la femme mince et cambrée, promenant un lent regard.","At nine o'clock the hall of the Théâtre des Variétés1 was still empty. A few people, on the balcony and in the orchestra, were waiting, lost among the garnet velvet armchairs, in the early light of the half-lighted chandelier. A shadow drowned the great red patch of the curtain; and not a sound came from the stage, the ramp extinguished, the musicians' desks loose. Only at the top, in the third gallery, around the rotunda of the ceiling where naked women and children took their flight in a sky greened by gas, calls and laughter came from a continuous hubbub of voices, from capped heads bonnets and caps 2 were stacked under the large round windows, framed in gold. From time to time an usher appeared, busy, coupons in hand, pushing before her a gentleman and a lady who were seated, the man in a coat, the slim, arched woman, casting a slow gaze.","At nine o’clock the Variety Theatre was still almost empty. In the balcony and orchestra stalls a few persons waited, lost amidst the garnet-coloured velvet seats, in the faint light of the half extinguished gasalier.a The huge crimson curtain was enveloped in shadow, and not a sound came from the stage behind. The foot-lights were not yet lit up, and the seats of the musicians were unoccupied. High up, however, in the third gallery, close to the roof—displaying figures of naked women and children floating among clouds, to which the gas imparted a greenish tinge—were heard the sounds of shouts and laughter above a continual hum of conversation, and a crowd of men and women, all wearing the caps of the working classes, were seated in rows reaching almost to the gilded festoons of the ceiling. Now and again an attendant would appear, fussily conducting a lady and gentleman to their seats—the gentleman in evening dress, and the lady slim and slightly stooping, and glancing slowly over the house.","At nine o'clock in the evening the body of the house at the Theatres des Varietes was still all but empty. A few individuals, it is true, were sitting quietly waiting in the balcony and stalls, but these were lost, as it were, among the ranges of seats whose coverings of cardinal velvet loomed in the subdued light of the dimly burning luster. A shadow enveloped the great red splash of the curtain, and not a sound came from the stage, the unlit footlights, the scattered desks of the orchestra. It was only high overhead in the third gallery, round the domed ceiling where nude females and children flew in heavens which had turned green in the gaslight, that calls and laughter were audible above a continuous hubbub of voices, and heads in women's and workmen's caps were ranged, row above row, under the wide-vaulted bays with their gilt- surrounding adornments. Every few seconds an attendant would make her appearance, bustling along with tickets in her hand and piloting in front of her a gentleman and a lady, who took their seats, he in his evening dress, she sitting slim and undulant beside him while her eyes wandered slowly round the house.","AT nine o’clock the auditorium of the Variétés* was still deserted. The gas-jets of the chandelier were turned down and in the half-light a mere handful of people sat waiting in the rows of dusky red-plush seats of the stalls and dress-circle. The large red patch of curtain was in shadow, the stage completely silent, the footlights were unlit, the orchestra desks unoccupied. Only in the gods, at the very top, round the dome where naked women and children were depicted cavorting against a sky stained green by gas fumes, was there a steady buzz of voices punctuated by shouting and laughter, where rows of heads in caps and bonnets were stacked in tiers in the large, gilt-framed, round bays. An occasional usherette bustled in with tickets in her hand, propelling a man and woman in front of her, the gentleman in evening dress, the lady slim, with her back arched, slowly casting her eyes around before subsiding into her seat."

"Les voitures s’étaient brusquement arrêtées. Surprise, la société descendit dans un endroit désert, au bas d’un coteau. Il fallut qu’un des cochers leur montrât du bout de son fouet les ruines de l’ancienne abbaye de Chamont, perdues dans les arbres. Ce fut une grosse déception. Les dames trouvèrent ça idiot : quelques tas de décombres, couverts de ronces, avec une moitié de tour écroulée. Vrai, ça ne valait pas la peine de faire deux lieues. Le cocher leur indiqua alors le château, dont le parc commençait près de l’abbaye, en leur conseillant de prendre un petit chemin et de suivre les murs ; ils feraient le tour, pendant que les voitures iraient les attendre sur la place du village. C'était une promenade charmante. La société accepta.","The cars had suddenly stopped. Surprised, the company went down to a deserted place, at the bottom of a hill. One of the coachmen had to show them with the end of his whip the ruins of the old abbey of Chamont, lost in the trees. It was a big disappointment. The ladies thought it silly: a few heaps of rubble, covered in brambles, with a half-tower collapsed. True, it was not worth going two leagues.

All they could see were a few heaps of rubbish, over-grown with brambles, and a half tumble-down tower. Really it was ridiculous to come two leagues to see that. The driver then pointed out to them the chateau, the park belonging to which was close to the abbey, and he told them they could reach it by following a little path that skirted the walls. They could take a look round whilst the carriages waited for them in the village. It was a most delightful walk.

Why, they were only a heap of old stones with briers growing over them and part of a tumble-down tower. It really wasn't worth coming a couple of leagues to see that! Then the driver pointed out to them the countryseat, the park of which stretched away from the abbey, and he advised them to take a little path and follow the walls surrounding it. They would thus make the tour of the place while the carriages would go and await them in the village square. It was a delightful walk, and the company agreed to the proposition.","Suddenly the carriages all stopped, and as the surprised passengers clambered out, they saw that they were in a deserted spot at the foot of a little hill.

Their ladyships thought it ridiculous: just a few heaps of old stones covered in brambles and a half-tumbledown tower! It certainly wasn’t worth driving all that way!

It was nearing one o'clock when the company separated, shouting au revoir as they went downstairs.","They served the Twelfth-cake,* and the bean went to Madame Lerat who popped it into Bosc’s glass. Everybody shouted playfully: ‘The King drinks! The King drinks!’ Nana took advantage of this noisy diversion to put her arm round Fontan’s neck and kiss him, whispering something into his ear. But the good-looking young Prullière exclaimed petulantly that that wasn’t fair. Louiset was asleep on a couple of chairs. The party didn’t break up till nearly one o’clock; as the guests went off downstairs, everybody shouted goodnight."

It’s only right; and, after all, she’s your wife. It’s not as though you were unfaithful to me with the first woman you came across.”","""Yes, yes,"" she rejoined, ""you must. But I'll be reasonable.

Is it really her who is over there, in that old man's coupe?...

"Nana ne bougea plus. Un bras derrière la nuque, une main prise dans l’autre, elle renversait la tête, les coudes écartés. Il voyait en raccourci ses yeux demi-clos, sa bouche entrouverte, son visage noyé d’un rire amoureux ; et, par-derrière, son chignon de cheveux jaunes dénoué lui couvrait le dos d’un poil de lionne. Ployée et le flanc tendu, elle montrait les reins solides, la gorge dure d’une guerrière, aux muscles forts sous le grain satiné de la peau. Une ligne fine, à peine ondée 20 par l’épaule et la hanche, filait d’un de ses coudes à son pied. Muffat suivait ce profil si tendre, ces fuites de chair blonde se noyant dans des lueurs dorées, ces rondeurs où la flamme des bougies mettait des reflets de soie. Il songeait à son ancienne horreur de la femme, au monstre de l’Écriture, lubrique21, sentant le fauve. Nana était toute velue, un duvet de rousse faisait de son corps un velours ; tandis que, dans sa croupe et ses cuisses de cavale22, dans les renflements charnus creusés de plis profonds, qui donnaient au sexe le voile troublant de leur ombre, il y avait de la bête. C'était la bête d’or, inconsciente comme une force, et dont l’odeur seule gâtait le monde. Muffat regardait toujours, obsédé, possédé, au point qu’ayant fermé les paupières pour ne plus voir, l’animal reparut au fond des ténèbres, grandi, terrible, exagérant sa posture. Maintenant, il serait là, devant ses yeux, dans sa chair, à jamais.","Nana didn't move. One arm behind the neck, one hand taken in the other, she tilted her head, elbows outstretched. He saw foreshortened her half-closed eyes, her half-open mouth, her face drowned in amorous laughter; and, behind, her loose chignon of yellow hair covered her back with lioness hair. Bent over and stretched out on her side, she showed her solid loins, the hard throat of a warrior, with strong muscles under the satin grain of the skin. A fine line, barely wavy through the shoulder and hip, ran from one of his elbows to his foot. Muffat followed this profile so tender, these leaks of blond flesh drowning in golden gleams, these curves on which the flame of the candles gave reflections of silk. He thought of his former horror of women, of the monster of Scripture, lustful,21 smelling of wild animals. Nana was all hairy, the down of a redhead made her body velvety; while, in her croup and her mare-like thighs,22 in the fleshy swellings hollowed out with deep folds, which gave sex the disturbing veil of their shadow, there was beast. It was the golden beast, unconscious as a force, and whose odor alone spoiled the world. Muffat was still staring, obsessed, possessed, to the point that, having closed his eyelids so as not to see any more, the animal reappeared in the depths of the darkness, grown up, terrible, exaggerating its posture. Now he would be there, before her eyes, in her flesh, forever.","Nana was not moving now. With an arm passed behind her neck, and one hand clasped in the other, she was leaning back her head, with her elbows wide apart. He caught sight obliquely of her half-closed eyes, her slightly opened mouth, her face covered with a bewitching smile, her firm amazonian breasts with their sturdy muscles quivering beneath the satin of her skin, and behind her her loose yellow hair covering her back with a mane like a lioness. Muffat followed this delicate profile, these flakes of rosy flesh disappearing in a golden shadow, these curves which the light of the candles caused to shine like silk. He thought of his old horror of woman, the monster of Scripture,ao lecherous and bestial. Nana was covered all over with a reddish down which gave to her skin the appearance of velvet; whilst, in her flanks and mare-like thighs, in the thick rolls of flesh which veiled her sex with their troubled shadow, there was something of the beast. It was the golden insect, unconscious of its power, but yet destroying the world with its smell alone. Muffat still continued to look, so completely possessed by the sight that, having for a moment lowered his eyelids and withdrawn his gaze, the animal reappeared in the depths of the darkness, enlarged, terrible, and with its posture exaggerated. And it would remain there, before his eyes in his very flesh, as it were, for evermore.","Nana no longer moved. With an arm behind her neck, one hand clasped in the other, and her elbows far apart, she was throwing back her head so that he could see a foreshortened reflection of her half- closed eyes, her parted lips, her face clothed with amorous laughter. Her masses of yellow hair were unknotted behind, and they covered her back with the fell of a lioness. Bending back thus, she displayed her solid Amazonian waist and firm bosom, where strong muscles moved under the satin texture of the skin. A delicate line, to which the shoulder and the thigh added their slight undulations, ran from one of her elbows to her foot, and Muffat's eyes followed this tender profile and marked how the outlines of the fair flesh vanished in golden gleams and how its rounded contours shone like silk in the candlelight. He thought of his old dread of Woman, of the Beast of the Scriptures, at once lewd and wild. Nana was all covered with fine hair; a russet made her body velvety, while the Beast was apparent in the almost equine development of her flanks, in the fleshy exuberances and deep hollows of her body, which lent her sex the mystery and suggestiveness lurking in their shadows. She was, indeed, that Golden Creature, blind as brute force, whose very odor ruined the world. Muffat gazed and gazed as a man possessed, till at last, when he had shut his eyes in order to escape it, the Brute reappeared in the darkness of the brain, larger, more terrible, more suggestive in its attitude. Now, he understood, it would remain before his eyes, in his very flesh, forever.","Nana was now standing motionless. With her hands clasped behind her neck, she was bending her head backwards, with her elbows apart. He had a foreshortened view of her half-closed eyes and half-open mouth; a voluptuous laugh was spreading over her face; her tawny hair was hanging loosely down her back like a lion’s mane. She was bending at the waist, forcing her hip sideways; with her firm buttocks and breasts, she was like some female warrior, her muscles rippling under her satiny skin. A delicate line, barely broken by her shoulder and hip, ran from one of her elbows down to her foot. Muffat followed this soft outline, this sweep of pale flesh glowing into a lustrous gold, these curves shimmering like silk in the flickering candles. He was thinking of his earlier horror of women, of the biblical monster, like some lascivious wild beast. And there was indeed something bestial in her fleshy rump, like a brood-mare ’s, her sturdy thighs, and in the full curves and deep creases behind which lurked the disturbing slit of her genitals. Nana was very hairy, her body covered all over in the velvety down of a redhead. She was the Golden Beast, a mindless force whose very scent could poison the world. Muffat was continuing to look, obsessed and possessed to such an extent that when he closed his eyes to stop watching, the beast loomed up again still larger out of the darkness, terrifying and even more menacing. And now he would see this beast in his mind and feel it in his flesh for ever."

Rose was crazy. As a good administrator, he would put order to this waste. For an article, either; but then door closed.

Rose was out of her senses. As became a good manager, he would put a stop to such spendthrift courses. In return for a notice, well and good, but afterward, decidedly not. Nevertheless, as he was fully aware of his wife's wrongheadedness and as he made it a rule to wink paternally at a folly now and again, when such was necessary, he answered amiably enough:","Mignon was playing with his watch-chain; he let his eye rest sternly for a second on the journalist.

"Une griserie mettait aux joues de Lucy Stewart les flammes rouges des poitrinaires38, tandis que Rose Mignon se faisait tendre, les yeux humides. Tatan Néné, étourdie d’avoir trop mangé, riait vaguement à sa bêtise. Les autres, Blanche, Caroline, Simonne, Maria parlaient toutes ensemble, racontant leurs affaires, une dispute avec leur cocher, un projet de partie à la campagne, des histoires compliquées d’amants volés et rendus. Mais un jeune homme, près de Georges, ayant voulu embrasser Léa de Horn, reçut une tape avec un : « Dites donc, vous ! lâchez-moi ! » plein d’une belle indignation ; et Georges, très gris, très excité par la vue de Nana, hésita devant une idée qu’il mûrissait gravement, celle de se mettre à quatre pattes, sous la table, et d’aller se blottir à ses pieds, ainsi qu’un petit chien. Personne ne l’aurait vu, il y serait resté bien sage. Puis, sur la prière de Léa, Daguenet ayant dit au jeune homme de se tenir tranquille, Georges, tout d’un coup, éprouva un gros chagrin, comme si l’on venait de le gronder lui-même ; c’était bête, c’était triste, il n’y avait plus rien de bon. Daguenet pourtant plaisantait, le forçait à avaler un grand verre d’eau, en lui demandant ce qu’il ferait, s’il se trouvait seul avec une femme, puisque trois verres de champagne le flanquaient par terre.","Intoxication filled Lucy Stewart's cheeks with the red flames of breasts,38 while Rose Mignon was tender, her eyes moist. Tatan Néné, stunned from having eaten too much, laughed vaguely at her stupidity. The others, Blanche, Caroline, Simonne, Maria were all talking together, recounting their affairs, an argument with their coachman, a plan for a party in the country, complicated stories of lovers stolen and returned. But a young man, close to Georges, having wanted to kiss Léa de Horn, received a slap with a: “Say, you! Let me go ! full of beautiful indignation; and Georges, very drunk, very excited by the sight of Nana, hesitated before an idea which he was seriously considering, that of getting on all fours under the table and going to snuggle up at her feet, like a little dog. No one would have seen him, he would have stayed there very well. Then, at Lea's request, Daguenet having told the young man to keep quiet, Georges suddenly felt very upset, as if he had just been scolded; it was stupid, it was sad, there was nothing good left. Daguenet, however, was joking, forcing him to swallow a large glass of water, asking him what he would do if he found himself alone with a woman, since three glasses of champagne flanked him on the floor.","A slight intoxication coloured Lucy Stewart’s cheeks with a consumptive-looking flush, whilst Rose Mignon, her eyes moist with a desire to cry, had become quite tender-hearted. Tatan Néné, dizzy with having eaten too much, laughed vaguely at her own stupidity. The others, Blanche, Caroline, Simone, Maria, were all talking together, telling each other their private affairs—a dispute with a coachman, a contemplated trip into the country, and some complicated stories of lovers stolen and returned; but a young man near George, having tried to kiss Léa de Horn, received a slap with an, “I say, you! just leave me alone!” full of the most virtuous indignation; and George, who was very drunk and excited by the sight of Nana, hesitated before putting into execution an idea he had been nursing, which was to crawl under the table, and curl himself up at her feet like a little dog. No one would have seen him, and he would have kept very quiet. Then, Daguenet having, at Léa’s desire, told the young man to behave himself, George, all of a sudden, felt quite sad, as though he had just been scolded himself ; it was stupid, it was dull, there was nothing left worth living for. Daguenet, however, joked with him, and made him drink a tumblerful of water, asking him at the same time what he would do if he found himself alone with a woman, as three glasses of champagne were too much for him.","Such was her state of exaltation that Lucy Stewart's cheeks were assuming a red, consumptive flush, while Rose Mignon with moist eyelids was growing excessively melting. Tatan Nene, greatly astonished at the thought that she had overeaten herself, was laughing vaguely over her own stupidity. The others, such as Blanche, Caroline, Simonne and Maria, were all talking at once and telling each other about their private affairs--about a dispute with a coachman, a projected picnic and innumerable complex stories of lovers stolen or restored. Meanwhile a young man near Georges, having evinced a desire to kiss Lea de Horn, received a sharp rap, accompanied by a ""Look here, you, let me go!"" which was spoken in a tone of fine indignation; and Georges, who was now very tipsy and greatly excited by the sight of Nana, hesitated about carrying out a project which he had been gravely maturing. He had been planning, indeed, to get under the table on all fours and to go and crouch at Nana's feet like a little dog. Nobody would have seen him, and he would have stayed there in the quietest way. But when at Lea's urgent request Daguenet had told the young man to sit still, Georges all at once felt grievously chagrined, as though the reproof had just been leveled at him. Oh, it was all silly and slow, and there was nothing worth living for! Daguenet, nevertheless, began chaffing and obliged him to swallow a big glassful of water, asking him at the same time what he would do if he were to find himself alone with a woman, seeing that three glasses of champagne were able to bowl him over.","Drink had brought a hectic, consumptive flush to Lucy Stewart’s cheeks, while Rose Mignon was becoming maudlin and tearful. In a stupor from having eaten so much, Tatan Néné was laughing vacantly at her own stupidity. The others, Blanche, Caroline, Simonne, Maria, were all talking together, telling each other about themselves, a quarrel with their coachman, a proposed excursion into the country, complicated stories of lovers stolen or recovered. But when a young man next to Georges tried to kiss Léa de Horn, he got a sharp rap and a thoroughly indignant: ‘ Careful, you! Who do you think you are?’ And Georges, very tipsy and excited, was in two minds about whether to proceed with an idea which he’d been seriously considering, of crawling on all-fours under the table and nestling at Nana’s feet, like a little dog. Then Léa asked Daguenet to tell the bold young man to behave, and Georges suddenly felt very miserable, as if he’d just been told off himself; how stupid and sad everything was, nothing was nice … However, Daguenet started teasing him, making him drink a tumbler of water, and asked him what he’d do if he was alone with a woman when three glasses of champagne were enough to knock him out."

"Nana fut scandalisée. Alors, on discuta les mérites des chevaux. La Faloise, pour affecter d’être très au courant, les traitait tous de rosses. Frangipane, au baron Verdier, était par 25 The Truth et Lenore ; un grand bai, qui aurait eu des chances, si on ne l’avait pas fourbu 26 à l’entraînement. Quant à Valerio II, de l’écurie Corbreuse, il n’était pas prêt, il avait eu des tranchées 27 en avril ; oh ! on cachait ça, mais lui en était sûr, parole d’honneur ! Et il finit par conseiller Hasard, un cheval de l’écurie Méchain, le plus défectueux de tous, dont personne ne voulait. Fichtre ! Hasard, une forme superbe, et une action ! Voilà une bête qui allait surprendre tout le monde !","Nana was scandalized. Then the merits of the horses were discussed. La Faloise, to affect to be well informed, called them all thugs. Frangipane, to Baron Verdier, was by 25 The Truth and Lenore; a big bay, who would have had a chance, if we hadn't worn him out 26 in training. As for Valerio II, from the Corbreuse stable, he was not ready, he had had trenches 27 in April; Oh ! We were hiding that, but he was sure of it, on my word of honor! And he ended up advising Hasard, a horse from the Méchain stable, the most defective of all, which no one wanted. Damn! Chance, superb form, and action! This is a beast that was going to surprise everyone!","Nana thought his language disgraceful. Then they discussed the merits of the different horses. La Faloise, to make everyone think that he was a judge of horse-flesh, pretended they were all sorry animals. Baron Verdier’s Frangipane, was by Truth out of Lenore; It was a big bay, and might have had a chance if it had not been lamed during training. As for Valerio II., from the Corbreuse stable, it was not in condition, it had had the gripes in April; oh! they were keeping that dark, but he was sure of it, on his word of honour! And he ended by recommending Hasard, a horse belonging to the Méchain stable, the worst beast of the lot, and which no one would look at. The deuce! Hasard showed superb form, and such a style! There was an animal that would surprise everyone!","Nana was scandalized. Presently the merits of the several horses began to be discussed, and La Faloise, wishing to be thought very much in the swim, spoke of them all as sorry jades. Frangipane, Baron Verdier's horse, was by The Truth out of Lenore. A big bay horse he was, who would certainly have stood a chance if they hadn't let him get foundered during training. As to Valerio II from the Corbreuse stable, he wasn't ready yet; he'd had the colic in April. Oh yes, they were keeping that dark, but he was sure of it, on his honor! In the end he advised Nana to choose Hazard, the most defective of the lot, a horse nobody would have anything to do with. Hazard, by jingo--such superb lines and such an action! That horse was going to astonish the people.","Nana was deeply shocked. They discussed the merits of the horses. Pretending to have it straight from the horse’s mouth, la Faloise said they were all nothing but hacks. Baron Verdier’s Frangipani was by Truth out of Lenora, and the big bay would have had a chance if it hadn’t suffered a strain during training. As for Valerio II from the Corbreuse stud, he wasn’t ready, he’d had a touch of enteritis in April; of course they were trying to hush it up, but he knew it as a fact, honour bright! His final recommendation was Hazard, a Méchain horse—the most suspect of the lot and a rank outsider. What a rattling good horse Hazard was, by Jove! Didn’t he move well! That gee-gee was going to surprise everybody!"

"Le vendredi, au déjeuner, il avait fallu mettre un nouveau couvert. M. Théophile Venot, que madame Hugon se souvint d’avoir invité l’hiver dernier, chez les Muffat, venait d’arriver. Il arrondissait le dos, il affectait une bonhomie d’homme insignifiant, sans paraître s’apercevoir de la déférence inquiète qu’on lui témoignait. Quand il eut réussi à se faire oublier, tout en croquant de petits morceaux de sucre au dessert, il examina Daguenet qui passait des fraises à Estelle, il écouta Fauchery dont une anecdote égayait beaucoup la comtesse. Dès qu’on le regardait, il souriait de son air tranquille. Au sortir de table, il prit le bras du comte, il l’emmena dans le parc. On savait qu’il gardait sur celui-ci une grande influence, depuis la mort de sa mère. Des histoires singulières couraient au sujet de la domination exercée dans la maison par l’ancien avoué. Fauchery, que son arrivée gênait sans doute, expliquait à Georges et à Daguenet les sources de sa fortune, un gros procès dont les Jésuites l’avaient chargé, autrefois ; et, selon lui, ce bonhomme, un terrible monsieur avec sa mine douce et grasse, trempait maintenant dans tous les tripotages de la prêtraille. Les deux jeunes gens s’étaient mis à plaisanter, car ils trouvaient un air idiot au petit vieillard. L'idée d’un Venot inconnu, d’un Venot gigantesque, instrumentant pour le clergé, leur semblait une imagination comique. Mais ils se turent lorsque le comte Muffat reparut, toujours au bras du bonhomme, très pâle, les yeux rouges comme s’il avait pleuré.","On Friday, at lunch, a new place had to be set. M. Théophile Venot, whom Madame Hugon remembered having invited last winter to the Muffats', had just arrived. He arched his back, he affected the good nature of an insignificant man, without seeming to notice the anxious deference shown him. When he had managed to make himself forgotten, while biting into little sugar cubes for dessert, he examined Daguenet who was passing strawberries to Estelle, he listened to Fauchery, an anecdote whose anecdote greatly amused the Countess. As soon as we looked at him, he smiled with his calm air. On leaving the table, he took the Count's arm and led him into the park. We knew that he kept a great influence on him, since the death of his mother. Strange stories circulated about the domination exercised in the house by the former solicitor. Fauchery, who was no doubt embarrassed by his arrival, explained to Georges and Daguenet the sources of his fortune, a serious trial with which the Jesuits had charged him formerly; and, according to him, this worthy fellow, a terrible gentleman with his sweet, fat face, was now involved in all the meddlesomeness of the priesthood. The two young people had started joking, because they thought the little old man looked silly. The idea of an unknown Venot, a gigantic Venot, instrumenting for the clergy, seemed to them a comic imagination. But they fell silent when Count Muffat reappeared, still on the old man's arm, very pale, his eyes red as if he had been crying.","On the Friday it had been necessary to lay another place at lunch. M. Théophile Venot, whom Madame Hugon recollected having invited at the Muffats’ the previous winter, had just arrived. He put on his most agreeable look, and affected the indifferent air of an insignificant person without appearing to notice the uneasy deference with which he was treated. When he had succeeded in making himself forgotten, and while crunching some little pieces of sugar during dessert, he watched Daguenet, who was handing some strawberries to Estelle, and listened to Fauchery, one of whose anecdotes seemed to amuse the countess very much. The moment anyone looked at him he smiled in his quiet way. On leaving the table, M. Venot took the count’s arm and led him into the grounds. It was known that he exercised a great influence over the count, ever since his mother’s death. Most singular stories were current as to the ex-attorney’s domination over the household. Fauchery, whose plans were no doubt considerably interfered with by his arrival, related to George and Daguenet the origin of his fortune—a big lawsuit with which the Jesuits had once intrusted him; and, according to him, this little old fellow, who was a terrible man in spite of his pleasant looks, had now a finger in every clerical pie. The two young fellows began to laugh, for they thought the old man looked a bit of an idiot. The idea of an unknown Venot, of a gigantic Venot, acting for the clergy, seemed to them most comical. But they ceased talking as Count Muffat, still with the old gentleman at his side, returned looking very pale, and with his eyes red as though he had been weeping.","On Friday a fresh place had to be laid at lunch time. M. Theophile Venot, whom Mme Hugon remembered to have invited at the Muffats' last winter, had just arrived. He sat stooping humbly forward and behaved with much good nature, as became a man of no account, nor did he seem to notice the anxious deference with which he was treated. When he had succeeded in getting the company to forget his presence he sat nibbling small lumps of sugar during dessert, looking sharply up at Daguenet as the latter handed Estelle strawberries and listening to Fauchery, who was making the countess very merry over one of his anecdotes. Whenever anyone looked at HIM he smiled in his quiet way. When the guests rose from table he took the count's arm and drew him into the park. He was known to have exercised great influence over the latter ever since the death of his mother. Indeed, singular stories were told about the kind of dominion which the ex-lawyer enjoyed in that household. Fauchery, whom his arrival doubtless embarrassed, began explaining to Georges and Daguenet the origin of the man's wealth. It was a big lawsuit with the management of which the Jesuits had entrusted him in days gone by. In his opinion the worthy man was a terrible fellow despite his gentle, plump face and at this time of day had his finger in all the intrigues of the priesthood. The two young men had begun joking at this, for they thought the little old gentleman had an idiotic expression. The idea of an unknown Venot, a gigantic Venot, acting for the whole body of the clergy, struck them in the light of a comical invention. But they were silenced when, still leaning on the old man's arm, Count Muffat reappeared with blanched cheeks and eyes reddened as if by recent weeping.","At lunch on the Friday there was a new face at table. Monsieur Venot had arrived; Madame Hugon recalled having invited him last winter at the Muffats’. His humble stoop, the image he offered of a good-natured man of no consequence, gave the impression that he was unaware of the uneasy deference surrounding him. Having retreated into the background, as he nibbled little lumps of sugar over dessert, he examined Daguenet who was passing some strawberries to Estelle and listened to one of Fauchery’s stories, which was making the countess laugh. As soon as people looked at him, he gave a quiet smile. When they left table, he took Muffat’s arm and led him off into the park. It was notorious that he still exercised great influence over the count since his mother’s death. There were queer stories going round concerning this ex-solicitor’s domination of the family. Fauchery, no doubt embarrassed by his arrival, explained to Georges and Daguenet the origins of his wealth, a big lawsuit in which he had acted for the Jesuits some time ago. According to Fauchery, this fellow with his meek, unctuous manner was a dreadful man who had a finger in every underhand intrigue of the dog-collar brigade. The two young men treated it as a joke, because they thought the old fellow looked a bit of an idiot and the idea of a secret Venot, a super-Venot working hand-in-glove with the clergy, seemed an amusing fancy. But when Count Muffat, still holding the old man’s arm, came back red-eyed as if he’d been crying, they fell silent."
"Son fils Olivier, dont elle parlait avec fierté, était élève à l’école de marine. Alors, on causa des enfants. Toutes ces dames s’attendrissaient.

Her baby, the little Louis, she said, was now at the house of her aunt, who brought him round to her every morning at eleven o'clock, when she would take him into her bed, where he played with her griffon dog Lulu.

"Nana quitta tout de suite la baignoire. Elle dut suivre à tâtons le couloir des fauteuils d’orchestre.

There, to rush the matter, he got carried away on the role of the casserole.","Nana left the box at once. She had to feel her way along the passage which led to the boxes and stalls; but Bordenave guessed she was there, as she was hurrying along in the dark, and he caught her up at the end of the corridor which passed behind the stage—a narrow place where the gas was kept burning night and day. There, so as to get the matter settled quickly, he at once attacked her about the part of Géraldine.","Nana forthwith left the corner box. She had to grope her way along the passage outside the stalls, but Bordenave guessed where she was as she passed along in the dark and caught her up at the end of the corridor passing behind the scenes, a narrow tunnel where the gas burned day and night. Here, in order to bluff her into a bargain, he plunged into a discussion of the courtesan's part.","Nana left the box straight away.

"Trois mois plus tard, un soir de décembre, le comte Muffat se promenait dans le passage des Panoramas. La soirée était très douce, une averse venait d’emplir le passage d’un flot de monde. Il y avait là une cohue, un défilé pénible et lent, resserré entre les boutiques. C'était, sous les vitres blanchies de reflets, un violent éclairage, une coulée de clartés, des globes blancs, des lanternes rouges, des transparents bleus, des rampes de gaz, des montres et des éventails géants en traits de flamme, brûlant en l’air ; et le bariolage des étalages, l’or des bijoutiers, les cristaux des confiseurs, les soies claires des modistes, flambaient, derrière la pureté des glaces, dans le coup de lumière crue des réflecteurs ; tandis que, parmi la débandade peinturlurée des enseignes, un énorme gant de pourpre, au loin, semblait une main saignante, coupée et attachée par une manchette jaune.","Three months later, one evening in December, Count Muffat was walking in the Passage des Panoramas. The evening was very mild, a downpour had just filled the passage with a flood of people. There was a throng there, a painful and slow defile, squeezed between the shops. There was, under the panes whitened with reflections, a violent lighting, a stream of light, white globes, red lanterns, blue transparencies, gas lines, watches and giant fans in lines of flame, burning in flames. the air ; and the variegated displays, the gold of the jewellers, the crystals of the confectioners, the clear silks of the milliners, blazed, behind the purity of the mirrors, in the harsh flash of the reflectors; while, amidst the painted disarray of the signs, an enormous purple glove in the distance looked like a bleeding hand, severed and bound by a yellow cuff.","Three months later, one night in December, Count Muffat was walking up and down the Passage des Panoramas. It was a very mild evening. A shower had just driven a crowd of people into the Passage. There was quite a mob, and it was a slow and difficult task to pass along between the shops on either side. Beneath the glass roof, brightened by the reflection, there was a most fierce illumination, consisting of an endless string of lights—white globes, red and blue lamps, rows of flaring gas-jets, and monstrous watches and fans formed of flames of fire—burning without any protection whatsoever; and the medley of colours in the various shop windows—the gold of the jewellers, the crystal vases of the confectioners, the pale silks of the milliners—blazed behind the spotless plate-glass, in the strong light cast by the reflectors; whilst among the chaos of gaudily painted signs, an enormous red glove in the distance looked like a bleeding hand, cut off and fixed to a yellow cuff.","One December evening three months afterward Count Muffat was strolling in the Passage des Panoramas. The evening was very mild, and owing to a passing shower, the passage had just become crowded with people. There was a perfect mob of them, and they thronged slowly and laboriously along between the shops on either side. Under the windows, white with reflected light, the pavement was violently illuminated. A perfect stream of brilliancy emanated from white globes, red lanterns, blue transparencies, lines of gas jets, gigantic watches and fans, outlined in flame and burning in the open. And the motley displays in the shops, the gold ornaments of the jeweler's, the glass ornaments of the confectioner's, the light- colored silks of the modiste's, seemed to shine again in the crude light of the reflectors behind the clear plate-glass windows, while among the bright-colored, disorderly array of shop signs a huge purple glove loomed in the distance like a bleeding hand which had been severed from an arm and fastened to a yellow cuff.","ONE December evening three months later, Count Muffat was walking through the Passage des Panoramas.

"Mais Nana ne pouvait se tenir. Elle était dans un ravissement d’amour, toute rose comme une vierge12, avec des rires et des regards trempés de tendresse. Les yeux fixés sur Fontan, elle l’accablait de petits noms : mon chien, mon loup, mon chat ; et, lorsqu’il lui passait de l’eau ou du sel, elle se penchait, le baisait au hasard des lèvres, sur les yeux, sur le nez, sur une oreille ; puis, si on la grondait, c’était avec des tactiques savantes, des humilités et des souplesses de chatte battue, qu’elle revenait, en lui prenant sournoisement la main pour la garder et la baiser encore. Il fallait qu’elle touchât quelque chose de lui. Fontan faisait le gros dos et se laissait adorer, plein de condescendance. Son grand nez remuait d’une joie toute sensuelle. Son museau de bouc, sa laideur de monstre cocasse s’étalait dans l’adoration dévote de cette fille superbe, si blanche et si grasse. Par moments, il rendait un baiser, en homme qui a tout le plaisir, mais qui veut se montrer gentil.","But Nana couldn't hold herself together. She was in a rapture of love, all rosy as a virgin,12 with laughter and looks soaked in tenderness. Her eyes fixed on Fontan, she overwhelmed him with little names: my dog, my wolf, my cat; and, when he passed her water or salt, she bent down, kissed him haphazardly on the lips, on the eyes, on the nose, on one ear; then, if they scolded her, it was with clever tactics, humility and the suppleness of a beaten cat, that she came back, slyly taking her hand to keep it and kiss it again. She had to touch something of him. Fontan arched his back and allowed himself to be adored, full of condescension. Her large nose moved with sensual joy. His goatee's muzzle, his comical monster's ugliness, spread out in the devout adoration of this superb girl, so white and so plump. At times he returned a kiss, like a man who has all the pleasure, but who wants to be nice.","But Nana could not restrain herself. She was all wrapped up in her love, as rosy as a virgin, and full of endearing smiles and glances. With her eyes fixed on Fontan, she called him all the pretty names she could think of —ducky, darling, cherub, and whenever he handed her anything, the water or the salt, she leant forward and kissed him on whatever part of his head her lips encountered—on his eyes, his nose, or his ears; then, if the others scolded her, she retired again to her seat with most wary tactics, and the humility and suppleness of a cat that had just been whipped, though at the same time slyly taking hold of his hand beneath the table, to kiss it again at the first opportunity. She must touch some part of him. Fontan assumed an important air, and condescendingly allowed himself to be adored. His big nose quivered with a sensual joy; his goatish physiognomy, his ugliness suggestive of some ridiculous monster, seemed to expand beneath the devout adoration of that superb girl, so plump and white. Occasionally he would return her kiss, like a man who, though having the best of it, still wishes to act nicely.","But Nana could not restrain herself. She was in a perfect ecstasy of love. Her face was as full of blushes as an innocent young girl's, and her looks and her laughter seemed to overflow with tenderness. Gazing on Fontan, she overwhelmed him with pet names-- ""my doggie, my old bear, my kitten""--and whenever he passed her the water or the salt she bent forward and kissed him at random on lips, eyes, nose or ear. Then if she met with reproof she would return to the attack with the cleverest maneuvers and with infinite submissiveness and the supple cunning of a beaten cat would catch hold of his hand when no one was looking, in order to kiss it again. It seemed she must be touching something belonging to him. As to Fontan, he gave himself airs and let himself be adored with the utmost condescension. His great nose sniffed with entirely sensual content; his goat face, with its quaint, monstrous ugliness, positively glowed in the sunlight of devoted adoration lavished upon him by that superb woman who was so fair and so plump of limb. Occasionally he gave a kiss in return, as became a man who is having all the enjoyment and is yet willing to behave prettily.","But Nana couldn’t restrain herself. She was ecstatic, all pink like a little girl, laughing, with her eyes oozing affection, staring at her man and smothering him in endearments, ‘my pet’, ‘my honey-bunch’, ‘my sweetie-pie,’ and whenever he passed her the salt or the water she’d bend forward and snatch a kiss on his lips, his nose, or an ear; and when she was told off for doing it, she’d look coy, wriggle about like a cat who’s been slapped, and cunningly change her tactics, slyly reaching for his hand and holding it so as to kiss it again. She couldn’t keep her hands off him. Fontan was accepting all this adulation with smug condescension. His big nose was twitching in sheer sensual pleasure. His freakish, comical face, like some ugly satyr’s, was basking in this adoration from this well-rounded young woman with such a wonderful white skin. Occasionally, he’d return one of her kisses, like a man full of his own pleasure but prepared to be charitable."
"Mais, par-dessus l’épaule de Muffat, elle rencontra le regard de Satin. Inquiète, elle le lâcha, elle continua gravement :","But, over Muffat's shoulder, she met Satin's gaze. Worried, she let him go, she continued gravely:","But over Muffat’s shoulder she encountered Satin’s fixed gaze. Feeling uneasy, she let go of him, and continued in a serious tone, “My friend, this marriage must take place; I don’t wish to prevent your daughter’s happiness.",But over Muffat's shoulder she met Satin's gaze. And she left him anxiously and in a grave voice continued:,Then she met Satin’s eyes over his shoulder and nervously released him. She continued earnestly:

"Cependant, des révoltes singulières redressaient encore le comte Muffat. Lui qui tolérait Satin depuis des mois, qui avait fini par accepter les inconnus, tout ce troupeau d’hommes galopant au travers de l’alcôve de Nana, s’emportait à l’idée d’être trompé par quelqu’un de son monde ou simplement de sa connaissance. Quand elle lui avoua ses rapports avec Foucarmont, il souffrit tellement, il trouva la trahison du jeune homme si abominable, qu’il voulut le provoquer et se battre. Comme il ne savait où chercher des témoins dans une pareille affaire, il s’adressa à Labordette. Celui-ci, stupéfait, ne put s’empêcher de rire.","However, singular revolts still revived Count Muffat. He who had tolerated Satin for months, who had ended up accepting strangers, all that herd of men galloping through Nana's alcove, got carried away at the idea of being deceived by someone from his world. or simply from his knowledge. When she confessed to him her relations with Foucarmont, he suffered so much, he found the young man's betrayal so abominable, that he wanted to provoke him and fight. As he did not know where to look for witnesses in such an affair, he addressed himself to Labordette. Stunned, he couldn't help but laugh.","Singular fits of revolt, however, still took possession of Count Muffat. He who had tolerated Satin for months past, who had ended by accepting strangers, all that troop of men galloping through Nana’s bedroom, became enraged at the idea of being deceived by any of his friends, or even acquaintances. When she owned to him her intimacy with Foucarmont, he suffered so much, he considered the young man’s treachery so abominable, that he wished to provoke him to a duel. As he did not know whom to ask to be his seconds in such an affair, he consulted Labordette. The latter was so astounded, that he could not refrain from laughing.","At times, however, Count Muffat was still singularly revolted. He who had tolerated Satin for months, who had at last shut his eyes to the unknown herd of men that scampered so quickly through Nana's bedroom, became terribly enraged at being deceived by one of his own set or even by an acquaintance. When she confessed her relations with Foucarmont he suffered so acutely, he thought the treachery of the young man so base, that he wished to insult him and fight a duel. As he did not know where to find seconds for such an affair, he went to Labordette. The latter, astonished, could not help laughing.","However, oddly enough, there were still certain things that stuck in Count Muffat’s throat. While he had put up with Satin for months and finally come round to accepting Nana’s unknown sexual partners, the constant stream of males leaping in and out of her bed, he was furious at the thought of being deceived by someone belonging to his own set or even by someone he knew. When she had admitted her affair with Foucarmont he’d been so hurt, and thought the young man’s duplicity so abominable, that he’d wanted to challenge him to a duel. As he didn’t know where to find seconds in this sort of matter he turned to Labordette, who was dumbfounded and couldn’t help laughing."

"Puis, comme on cognait à la porte, elle fut bonne fille, repoussant la fenêtre, jetant les vêtements de son amie au fond d’une armoire. Déjà elle s’était résignée en se disant qu’après tout, si on la mettait en carte, elle n’aurait plus cette bête de peur.

"On ne devait pas sortir ce jour-là, la pluie tombait encore par averses. Georges s’était hâté de disparaître, enfermé à double tour dans sa chambre. Ces messieurs évitèrent de s’expliquer entre eux, tout en n’étant pas dupes des raisons qui les réunissaient. Vandeuvres, très maltraité par le jeu, avait eu réellement l’idée de se mettre au vert ; et il comptait sur le voisinage d’une amie pour l’empêcher de trop s’ennuyer. Fauchery, profitant des vacances que lui donnait Rose, alors très occupée, se proposait de traiter d’une seconde chronique avec Nana, dans le cas où la campagne les attendrirait tous les deux. Daguenet, qui la boudait depuis Steiner, songeait à renouer, à ramasser quelques douceurs, si l’occasion se présentait. Quant au marquis de Chouard, il guettait son heure. Mais, parmi ces hommes suivant à la trace Vénus, mal débarbouillée de son rouge, Muffat était le plus ardent, le plus tourmenté par des sensations nouvelles de désir, de peur et de colère, qui se battaient dans son être bouleversé. Lui, avait une promesse formelle, Nana l’attendait. Pourquoi donc était-elle partie deux jours plus tôt ? Il résolut de se rendre à la Mignotte, le soir même, après le dîner.","We weren't supposed to go out that day, the rain was still falling in showers. Georges had hastened to disappear, locked in his room. These gentlemen avoided explaining themselves to each other, while not being fooled by the reasons that brought them together. Vandeuvres, very badly treated by the game, had really had the idea of going green; and he counted on the neighborhood of a friend to keep him from being too bored. Fauchery, taking advantage of the holidays given to him by Rose, who was very busy at the time, proposed to do a second column with Nana, in case the campaign should soften them both. Daguenet, who had been shunning her since Steiner, thought of reconnecting, of picking up some sweets, if the opportunity arose. As for the Marquis de Chouard, he was watching his hour. But among these men following in the footsteps of Venus, badly cleared of her rouge, Muffat was the most ardent, the most tormented by new sensations of desire, fear and anger, which battled in his upset being. He had a formal promise, Nana was waiting for him. Why had she left two days earlier? He resolved to go to La Mignotte that same evening, after dinner.","No one was going out that day, as it was still very showery. George had hastily disappeared and locked himself in his room. The gentlemen avoided coming to an explanation among themselves, though they individually knew very well what reasons had brought them together. Vandeuvres, who had lost heavily at play, had indeed entertained the idea of spending some time in the country, and counted on the proximity of a female friend to reconcile him to his voluntary exile. Fauchery, taking advantage of the holiday allowed him by Rose, who just then was very much occupied, proposed to make an arrangement with Nana for a second article, in the event of a country life bringing their hearts together again. Daguenet, who had been sulky ever since Steiner appeared on the scene, thought of making it up again, and of picking up a few crumbs of love, should occasion offer. As for the Marquis de Chouard, he bided his time. But among all these men on the track of Venus, only half free of her paint, Muffat was the most ardent, the most tormented with new sensations of desire, of fear, and of anger, which contended in his agitated person. He had a distinct promise. Nana was expecting him. Why, then, had she left Paris two days earlier? He determined to go to La Mignotte that very night, after the dinner.","It was impossible to go out that day, for the rain was still falling in heavy showers. Georges had made haste to disappear from the scene and had double-locked his door. These gentlemen avoided mutual explanations, though they were none of them deceived as to the reasons which had brought them together. Vandeuvres, who had had a very bad time at play, had really conceived the notion of lying fallow for a season, and he was counting on Nana's presence in the neighborhood as a safeguard against excessive boredom. Fauchery had taken advantage of the holidays granted him by Rose, who just then was extremely busy. He was thinking of discussing a second notice with Nana, in case country air should render them reciprocally affectionate. Daguenet, who had been just a little sulky with her since Steiner had come upon the scene, was dreaming of resuming the old connection or at least of snatching some delightful opportunities if occasion offered. As to the Marquis de Chouard, he was watching for times and seasons. But among all those men who were busy following in the tracks of Venus--a Venus with the rouge scarce washed from her cheeks--Muffat was at once the most ardent and the most tortured by the novel sensations of desire and fear and anger warring in his anguished members. A formal promise had been made him; Nana was awaiting him. Why then had she taken her departure two days sooner than was expected? He resolved to betake himself to La Mignotte after dinner that same evening.","Nobody was going out that day; it was still showery. Georges had quickly taken himself off to his bedroom and locked himself in. The gentlemen avoided any discussion of their business at Les Fondettes, though they knew well enough why they were all down here together. Vandeuvres, who was in dire straits because of his gambling, really did have thoughts of putting himself out to grass and was relying on having a girl-friend handy should he get too bored. Fauchery was taking advantage of leave of absence from Rose, who was extremely busy at the moment, and he planned to negotiate with Nana on the subject of another article about her, in the hope that the country air would lead to greater warmth in their relationship. Daguenet, who’d been on bad terms with Nana ever since the Steiner episode, was thinking of making it up with her and picking up a few favours should luck smile his way. As for the marquis, he was biding his time. But among all these men pursuing this blonde Venus before she’d even had time to remove all her grease-paint, the keenest of all was Muffat, and the most tormented by the unfamiliar feelings of lust, fear, and anger which were tearing him apart. She had given him her solemn promise and was expecting him. Then why had she left two days early? He determined to go over to La Mignotte after dinner that very night."
"Le soir, comme le comte sortait du parc, Georges s’enfuit derrière lui. Il le laissa suivre la route de Gumières, traversa la Choue, tomba chez Nana, essoufflé, enragé, avec des larmes plein les yeux. Ah ! il avait bien compris, ce vieux qui était en route venait pour un rendez-vous. Nana, stupéfaite de cette scène de jalousie, toute remuée de voir comment tournaient les choses, le prit dans ses bras, le consola du mieux qu’elle put. Mais non, il se trompait, elle n’attendait personne ; si le monsieur venait, ce n’était pas sa faute. Ce Zizi, quelle grosse bête, de se causer tant de bile pour rien ! Sur la tête de son enfant, elle n’aimait que son Georges. Et elle le baisait, et elle essuyait ses larmes.","In the evening, as the Count left the park, Georges fled after him. He let him follow the road to Gumières, crossed La Choue, fell at Nana's, breathless, enraged, with tears in his eyes. Ah! he had understood, this old man who was on his way was coming for an appointment. Nana, stupefied by this scene of jealousy, quite shaken to see how things were turning out, took him in her arms, consoled him as best she could. But no, he was mistaken, she was not expecting anyone; if the gentleman came, it was not his fault. This Zizi, what a beast, to cause so much bile for nothing! On the head of her child, she only loved her Georges. And she kissed him, and she wiped away his tears.","That evening, as the count left the grounds, George followed him. He parted from him on the road to Gumières, and, wading across the Choue, arrived at Nana’s all out of breath, his eyes filled with tears of rage. Ah! he understood. That old fellow who was on the road had an appointment with her. Nana, astonished at this display of jealousy, uneasy at the turn things were taking, folded her arms around him, and consoled him as well as she could. No; he was mistaken. She was not expecting any one. If the gentleman was coming it was not her fault. Zizi was a great stupid to put himself out so much about nothing at all! She swore by her child that she loved no one but her George, and she kissed him, and wiped away his tears.","At night as the count was leaving the park Georges fled forth after him. He left him to follow the road to Gumieres, crossed the Choue, rushed into Nana's presence, breathless, furious and with tears in his eyes. Ah yes, he understood everything! That old fellow now on his way to her was coming to keep an appointment! Nana was dumfounded by this ebullition of jealousy, and, greatly moved by the way things were turning out, she took him in her arms and comforted him to the best of her ability. Oh no, he was quite beside the mark; she was expecting no one. If the gentleman came it would not be her fault. What a great ninny that Zizi was to be taking on so about nothing at all! By her child's soul she swore she loved nobody except her own Georges. And with that she kissed him and wiped away his tears.","That same evening, as the count was leaving the park, Georges slipped away after him, watched him go off along the Gumières road, scrambled across the Choue, and reached Nana’s house out of breath, very angry, and with tears in his eyes. Oh, he knew what was happening, that old man was on his way to a rendezvous with her! Flabbergasted by this display of jealousy and upset by the turn things were taking, Nana took him into her arms and comforted him as well as she could. It wasn’t true , he was quite wrong, she wasn’t expecting anybody. If that man was on his way there it wasn’t her fault. What a silly billy he was to get into such a state for no reason at all! She solemnly swore, on her son’s head, that she didn’t love anybody but her little Zizi. Then she kissed him and wiped away his tears."

Nevertheless, you must look at the matter quietly: you're not dishonored because it's happened.""","‘Come along now, calm down’, the young woman said in her kindliest voice. ‘I’ve known about this for a long time. But naturally I’d never want to let you know about it. You remember, you had suspicions last year and then, thanks to my common sense, things worked out all right. In fact, you hadn’t got any proofs and now that you have I can see that it’s hard for you. All the same, you must be sensible. You’ve got no need to feel disgraced by it.’"

"Puis, le public redevint froid ; les scènes suivantes furent trouvées ennuyeuses. C'est à peine si le vieux Bosc, un Jupiter imbécile, la tête écrasée sous une couronne immense, dérida un instant le public, lorsqu’il eut une querelle de ménage avec Junon46, à propos du compte de leur cuisinière. Le défilé des dieux, Neptune47, Pluton48, Minerve 49 et les autres, faillit même tout gâter. On s’impatientait, un murmure inquiétant grandissait lentement, les spectateurs se désintéressaient et regardaient dans la salle. Lucy riait avec Labordette ; le comte de Vandeuvres allongeait la tête, derrière les fortes épaules de Blanche ; tandis que Fauchery, du coin de l’œil, examinait les Muffat, le comte très grave, comme s’il n’avait pas compris, la comtesse vaguement souriante, les yeux perdus, rêvant. Mais, brusquement, dans ce malaise, les applaudissements de la claque crépitèrent avec la régularité d’un feu de peloton. On se tourna vers la scène. Était-ce Nana enfin ? Cette Nana se faisait bien attendre.","Then the public became cold again; the following scenes were found boring. Old Bosc, an imbecile Jupiter, his head crushed under an immense crown, hardly cheered up the audience for a moment when he had a domestic quarrel with Juno46 over the account of their cook. The procession of the gods, Neptune47, Pluto48, Minerva 49 and the others, almost spoiled everything. People grew impatient, a disturbing murmur grew slowly, the spectators lost interest and looked around the room. Lucy was laughing with Labordette; the Comte de Vandeuvres stretched out his head behind Blanche's strong shoulders; while Fauchery, out of the corner of his eye, examined the Muffats, the Count very grave, as if he had not understood, the Countess vaguely smiling, her eyes lost, dreaming. But suddenly, in this discomfort, the applause of the slap crackled with the regularity of a platoon fire. We turned to the stage. Was it Nana after all? This Nana was long overdue.","After that, however, the audience became as cool as before; the scenes which followed were dull in the extreme. Old Bosc, as an imbecile Jupiter, his head crushed under an enormous crown, succeeded only in raising a smile, as he quarrelled with Juno on account of their cook’s wages. The procession of the gods Neptune, Pluto, Minerva, and all the others, almost spoilt everything. The spectators were becoming very impatient, an ominous murmur slowly arose, every one began to lose all interestin the piece, and looked about the house rather than upon the stage. Lucy laughed with Labordette; the Count de Vandeuvres emerged a little from behind Blanche’s broad shoulders; while Fauchery watched the Muffats from out of the corner of his eyes. The count looked very grave, as if he had not understood anything; and the countess, smiling vaguely, seemed wrapped in reverie. But suddenly the applause of the claque burst forth with the regularity of a discharge of musketry, and every eye became rivetted on the stage once more. Was it Nana at last—that Nana who had kept them waiting so long?","Then the public cooled again, for the ensuing scenes were found tiresome. Old Bosc, an imbecile Jupiter with head crushed beneath the weight of an immense crown, only just succeeded in raising a smile among his audience when he had a domestic altercation with Juno on the subject of the cook's accounts. The march past of the gods, Neptune, Pluto, Minerva and the rest, was well-nigh spoiling everything. People grew impatient; there was a restless, slowly growing murmur; the audience ceased to take an interest in the performance and looked round at the house. Lucy began laughing with Labordette; the Count de Vandeuvres was craning his neck in conversation behind Blanche's sturdy shoulders, while Fauchery, out of the corners of his eyes, took stock of the Muffats, of whom the count appeared very serious, as though he had not understood the allusions, and the countess smiled vaguely, her eyes lost in reverie. But on a sudden, in this uncomfortable state of things, the applause of the clapping contingent rattled out with the regularity of platoon firing. People turned toward the stage. Was it Nana at last? This Nana made one wait with a vengeance.","After this the audience became lukewarm again: they found the next scenes boring. Old Bosc, a moronic Jupiter with his head squeezed into an immense crown, barely managed to raise a smile in his domestic squabble with Juno over the cook’s bill. The parade of gods and goddesses, Neptune, Pluto, Minerva, and all the rest, almost wrecked the show; the public was getting impatient; a sinister muttering was slowly spreading through the house as people started to lose interest and let their eyes wander round the theatre. Lucy was laughing with Labordette; Count de Vandeuvres was craning his neck behind Blanche’s plump shoulders; meanwhile Fauchery was examining the Muffats out of the corner of his eye: the count was looking solemn as if he didn’t know what was happening, the countess had a vague smile on her face and was gazing dreamily into space. But suddenly, at this awkward moment, the claque began loudly clapping, in time, like the rattle of gunfire. People looked towards the stage: was it Nana at last? She was certainly taking her time!"

"Ce dimanche-là, par un ciel orageux des premières chaleurs de juin, on courait le Grand Prix de Paris 1 au bois de Boulogne. Le matin, le soleil s’était levé dans une poussière rousse. Mais, vers onze heures, au moment où les voitures arrivaient à l’hippodrome de Longchamp, un vent du sud avait balayé les nuages ; des vapeurs grises s’en allaient en longues déchirures, des trouées d’un bleu intense s’élargissaient d’un bout à l’autre de l’horizon. Et, dans les coups de soleil qui tombaient entre deux nuées, tout flambait brusquement, la pelouse 2 peu à peu emplie d’une cohue d’équipages, de cavaliers et de piétons, la piste encore vide, avec la guérite du juge, le poteau d’arrivée, les mâts des tableaux indicateurs, puis en face, au milieu de l’enceinte du pesage, les cinq tribunes symétriques, étageant leurs galeries de briques et de charpentes. Au-delà, la vaste plaine s’aplatissait, se noyait dans la lumière de midi, bordée de petits arbres, fermée à l’ouest par les coteaux boisés de Saint-Cloud et de Suresnes, que dominait le profil sévère du mont Valérien.","That Sunday, under a stormy sky in the first heat of June, we ran the Grand Prix de Paris 1 in the Bois de Boulogne. In the morning, the sun had risen in a reddish dust. But around eleven o'clock, when the cars arrived at the Longchamp racecourse, a southerly wind had swept away the clouds; gray vapors went away in long tears, gaps of an intense blue widened from one end of the horizon to the other. And, in the sunburn that fell between two clouds, everything suddenly blazed, the lawn 2 gradually filled with a throng of carriages, riders and pedestrians, the track still empty, with the judge's sentry box, the arrival post, the masts of the scoreboards, then opposite, in the middle of the weighing enclosure, the five symmetrical stands, layering their galleries of bricks and frameworks. Beyond, the vast plain flattened out, drowned in the midday light, lined with small trees, closed off to the west by the wooded hillsides of Saint-Cloud and Suresnes, dominated by the severe profile of Mont Valérien.","The dog, asleep amongst her skirts, was shivering in spite of the heat, whilst the child, dressed up in ribbons and lace, remained as though dumb, and had become so pale from the force of the wind that he looked like a wax figure.","Meanwhile the young woman, without troubling about the people near her, talked at the top of her voice with Georges and Philippe Hugon, who were seated opposite on the front seat among such a mountain of bouquets of white roses and blue myosotis that they were buried up to their shoulders.","the extensive public enclosure gradually filling up with carriages and people on foot or horseback; the track itself, still deserted, with its judge’s box, the winning-post, the pole to display the horses’ numbers on; and the five symmetrical grandstands opposite, with their brick-and-timber balconies one above the other, set in the middle of the private enclosure. Beyond all this the huge level plain lay bathed in the midday sun, with its border of little trees, stretching out until it was lost in the distance, cut off in the west by the wooded slopes of Suresne and Saint Cloud, dominated by the harsh outline of the Mont Valérien."
"On riait, en effet, autour de madame Chantereau, qui venait de répéter ce propos, entendu par elle en Alsace, où son mari possédait une usine.","People laughed, in fact, around Madame Chantereau, who had just repeated this remark, heard by her in Alsace, where her husband owned a factory.","They were, in fact, all laughing at Madame Chantereau, who had just made the statement, which she had heard in Alsace, where her husband owned a factory.","Indeed, they were laughing round Mme Chantereau, who had just repeated an assertion she had heard made in Alsace, where her husband owned a foundry.","And indeed, people round Madame Chantereau were laughing; she had just repeated a remark which she heard someone make in Alsace, where her husband had a factory."

"La voiture s’était arrêtée devant la grille. Une petite porte s’ouvrit, et le jardinier, un grand sec, parut, sa casquette à la main. Nana voulut retrouver sa dignité, car le cocher déjà semblait rire en dedans, avec ses lèvres cousues. Elle se retint pour ne pas courir, écouta le jardinier, très bavard celui-là, qui priait madame d’excuser le désordre, attendu qu’il avait seulement reçu la lettre de madame le matin ; mais, malgré ses efforts, elle était enlevée de terre, elle marchait si vite que Zoé ne pouvait la suivre. Au bout de l’allée, elle s’arrêta un instant, pour embrasser la maison d’un coup d’œil. C'était un grand pavillon de style italien, flanqué d’une autre construction plus petite, qu’un riche Anglais avait fait bâtir, après deux ans de séjour à Naples, et dont il s’était dégoûté tout de suite.","The car had stopped in front of the gate. A little door opened, and the gardener, looking very dry, appeared, his cap in his hand. Nana wanted to recover her dignity, for the coachman already seemed to be laughing inside, with his lips sewn together. She restrained herself from running, listened to the gardener, very talkative that one, who begged Madame to excuse the disorder, seeing that he had only received Madame's letter in the morning; but, despite her efforts, she was lifted from the ground, she was walking so fast that Zoe could not follow her. At the end of the drive, she paused for a moment to take in the house at a glance. It was a large pavilion in the Italian style, flanked by another smaller building, which a wealthy Englishman had had built after two years in Naples, and which he immediately grew sick of.","The carriage had stopped in front of the iron gates. A little side door was opened, and the gardener, a tall thin fellow, appeared holding his cap in his hand. Nana tried to look dignified, for the driver already seemed to be laughing inwardly, though his lips were tightly compressed together. She restrained herself from running, and listened to the gardener, a very talkative one by the way, who begged madame to excuse the place being a little untidy, as he had only received her letter that very morning; but, in spite of her efforts, she seemed to be lifted from the earth, and walked so fast that Zoé could not keep up with her. At the end of the path she stopped for an instant to take a look at the house. It was a large building in the Italian style, flanked by a smaller structure, and had been erected by a rich Englishman who had resided for two years at Naples; he had, however, soon taken a dislike to it.","The carriage had by this time pulled up before the park gates. A side door was opened, and the gardener, a tall, dry fellow, made his appearance, cap in hand. Nana made an effort to regain her dignity, for the driver seemed now to be suppressing a laugh behind his dry, speechless lips. She refrained from setting off at a run and listened to the gardener, who was a very talkative fellow. He begged Madame to excuse the disorder in which she found everything, seeing that he had only received Madame's letter that very morning. But despite all his efforts, she flew off at a tangent and walked so quickly that Zoe could scarcely follow her. At the end of the avenue she paused for a moment in order to take the house in at a glance. It was a great pavilionlike building in the Italian manner, and it was flanked by a smaller construction, which a rich Englishman, after two years' residence in Naples, had caused to be erected and had forthwith become disgusted with.","The carriage had stopped in front of an iron gate. A tall, lean man came out of a small door, hat in hand. It was the gardener. Nana tried to control her excitement because the driver seemed to be laughing to himself behind his tightly shut lips. She made an effort not to rush away on her own, and listened to the gardener who, unlike the driver, was very loquacious; madam must please overlook the untidiness because he’d only got her letter that morning; but try as she might, her feet were twinkling over the ground and she was walking so fast that Zoé couldn’t keep up with her. At the end of the avenue Nana stopped for a second to take in the whole building. It was a large, vaguely Italian sort of villa with another, smaller building set beside it; it had been built by a rich Englishman who’d spent two years in Naples, and who had then taken an immediate dislike to it."

"Le prince, les yeux à demi clos, suivit en connaisseur les lignes renflées de sa gorge, tandis que le marquis de Chouard eut un hochement de tête involontaire. Muffat, pour ne plus voir, regarda le tapis. D’ailleurs, Vénus était prête, elle portait simplement cette gaze aux épaules. Madame Jules tournait autour d’elle, de son air de petite vieille en bois, aux yeux vides et clairs : et, vivement, elle prenait des épingles sur la pelote inépuisable de son cœur, elle épinglait la tunique de Vénus, frôlant toutes ces grasses nudités de ses mains séchées, sans un souvenir et comme désintéressée de son sexe.","The prince, his eyes half-closed, followed the swollen lines of her throat like a connoisseur, while the Marquis de Chouard nodded involuntarily.

Muffat, in order that he might see no more, gazed down at the carpet. Venus was now ready, as that gauze drapery was all that she wore over her shoulders. Madame Jules hovered round her, looking like an old woman carved out of wood, with clear, expressionless eyes, and every now and then she kept taking pins from the inexhaustible cushion over her heart to pin Venus ’s tunic, passing her bony hands over those next to naked rolls of fat, without their awakening in her mind a single recollection, and with the greatest indifference for her sex.","The prince with half-closed eyes marked the swelling lines of her bosom with an air of connoisseurship, while the Marquis de Chouard wagged his head involuntarily. Muffat gazed at the carpet in order not to see any more. At length Venus, with only her gauze veil over her shoulders, was ready to go on the stage. Mme Jules, with vacant, unconcerned eyes and an expression suggestive of a little elderly wooden doll, still kept circling round her. With brisk movements she took pins out of the inexhaustible pincushion over her heart and pinned up Venus' tunic, but as she ran over all those plump nude charms with her shriveled hands, nothing was suggested to her. She was as one whom her sex does not concern.","With eyes half-closed, the prince was letting his gaze wander over the curves of her breasts while the Marquis de Chouard couldn’t resist giving an approving nod. To avoid having to see anything more, Count Muffat looked down at the carpet. With nothing more than a piece of gauze covering her shoulders, Venus was now ready. Madame Jules was fussing round her like a little old wooden figure with bright empty eyes, swiftly pulling pins out of the inexhaustible store over her heart to fix up the tunic, brushing her desiccated hands over Venus’s plump young flesh with complete unconcern as to her sex or her past."

"L'hôtel de Nana se trouvait avenue de Villiers, à l’encoignure de la rue Cardinet, dans ce quartier de luxe, en train de pousser au milieu des terrains vagues de l’ancienne plaine Monceau. Bâti par un jeune peintre, grisé d’un premier succès et qui avait dû le revendre à peine les plâtres essuyés, il était de style Renaissance2, avec un air de palais, une fantaisie de distribution intérieure, des commodités modernes dans un cadre d’une originalité un peu voulue. Le comte Muffat avait acheté l’hôtel tout meublé, empli d’un monde de bibelots, de fort belles tentures d’Orient, de vieilles crédences3, de grands fauteuils Louis XIII ; et Nana était ainsi tombée sur un fonds de mobilier artistique, d’un choix très fin, dans le tohu-bohu des époques4. Mais, comme l’atelier, qui occupait le centre de la maison, ne pouvait lui servir, elle avait bouleversé les étages, laissant au rez-de-chaussée une serre, un grand salon et la salle à manger, établissant au premier un petit salon, près de sa chambre et de son cabinet de toilette. Elle étonnait l’architecte par les idées qu’elle lui donnait, née d’un coup aux raffinements du luxe, en fille du pavé de Paris ayant d’instinct toutes les élégances. Enfin, elle ne gâta pas trop l’hôtel, elle ajouta même aux richesses du mobilier, sauf quelques traces de bêtise tendre et de splendeur criarde, où l’on retrouvait l’ancienne fleuriste qui avait rêvé devant les vitrines des passages5.","The Hôtel de Nana was located on avenue de Villiers, at the corner of rue Cardinet, in this luxury district, growing amidst the vacant lots of the old Monceau plain. Built by a young painter, intoxicated by a first success and who had had to sell it as soon as the plaster had been wiped off, it was in the Renaissance style2, with an air of a palace, a fancy interior layout, modern conveniences in a setting of a somewhat deliberate originality. Count Muffat had bought the hotel fully furnished, filled with a world of knick-knacks, very fine Oriental hangings, old credenzas, large Louis XIII armchairs; and Nana had thus come across a fund of artistic furniture, of a very fine choice, in the hustle and bustle of the times. But, as the studio, which occupied the center of the house, could not serve her, she had upset the floors, leaving on the ground floor a greenhouse, a large living room and the dining room, establishing on the first floor a small living room, near his bedroom and his bathroom. She astonished the architect by the ideas she gave him, born suddenly to the refinements of luxury, as a girl from the streets of Paris instinctively possessing all the elegances. Finally, it did not spoil the hotel too much, it even added to the richness of the furniture, except for a few traces of tender stupidity and garish splendor, where one found the former florist who had dreamed in front of the windows of the passages.","Nana’s mansion was in the Avenue de Villiers, at the corner of the Rue Cardinet, in that quarter of luxury which had sprung up in the midst of the empty expanse, formerly the plain of Monceau. Erected by a young painter intoxicated by a first success, and who had been forced to sell it when the plaster was scarcely dry, it was built in the renaissance style, with the air of a palace, a certain fantastical internal arrangement, and modern conveniences within a space rather restricted for such a display of originality. Count Muffat had purchased the place furnished, full of a host of knick-knacks, of beautiful Eastern hangings, of old credences, and big arm-chairs of the time of Louis XIII. ; and Nana had thus fallen into a stock of the choicest artistic furniture selected from the productions of centuries. But as the studio which occupied the centre of the building could be of no use to her, she had pulled the different floors to pieces, leaving on the ground floor a conservatory, a drawing-room, and a dining-room, and arranging a parlour on the first floor close to her bed-room and dressing-room. She surprised the architect by the ideas she gave him, showing herself at once at home in all the refinements of luxury, like the Paris street-girl who has the instinct of elegance. In short, she did not spoil the mansion over much—she even added to the richness of its furniture—with the exception of a few traces of tender stupidity and gaudy splendour, typical of the former artificial flower-maker who had dreamily gazed into the shop windows of the Passages.","Nana's fine house was situated at the corner of the Rue Cardinet, in the Avenue de Villiers. The avenue was part of the luxurious quarter at that time springing up in the vague district which had once been the Plaine Monceau. The house had been built by a young painter, who was intoxicated by a first success, and had been perforce resold almost as soon as it was habitable. It was in the palatial Renaissance manner and had fantastic interior arrangements which consisted of modern conveniences framed in a setting of somewhat artificial originality. Count Muffat had bought the house ready furnished and full of hosts of beautiful objects--lovely Eastern hangings, old credences, huge chairs of the Louis XIII epoch. And thus Nana had come into artistic surroundings of the choicest kind and of the most extravagantly various dates. But since the studio, which occupied the central portion of the house, could not be of any use to her, she had upset existing arrangements, establishing a small drawing room on the first floor, next to her bedroom and dressing room, and leaving a conservatory, a large drawing room and a dining room to look after themselves underneath. She astonished the architect with her ideas, for, as became a Parisian workgirl who understands the elegancies of life by instinct, she had suddenly developed a very pretty taste for every species of luxurious refinement. Indeed, she did not spoil her house overmuch; nay, she even added to the richness of the furniture, save here and there, where certain traces of tender foolishness and vulgar magnificence betrayed the ex-flower seller who had been wont to dream in front of shopwindows in the arcades.","She lived in a mansion in the Avenue de Villiers, on the corner of the Rue Cardinet, in that luxurious district being developed in the middle of the wastelands of what used to be the plain of Monceau. The house had been built by a young painter in the first flush of his success, and he’d been forced to sell it almost before the plaster was dry. It was a palatial, Renaissance-style building with a fantastic interior arrangement of rooms and furniture, modern comfort in a setting of rather studied originality. Count Muffat had bought it complete with all the furnishings, a ragbag of knick-knacks, of wonderful Oriental hangings, antique sideboards, and huge Louis XIII armchairs; Nana had found herself surrounded by a mass of expertly chosen artistic furniture, a jumble of various periods. However, as the studio occupying the centre of the house was of no use to her, she’d reorganized the various floors, leaving a conservatory, a large drawing-room, and the dining-room on the ground floor and putting a small drawing-room on the first floor, next to her bedroom and dressing-room. She surprised the architect with her ideas; brought up in the streets of Paris but having an instinctive feel for elegance of every sort, she suddenly became aware of the possibilities of luxury and refinement. In the end, she didn’t spoil the house too much and even added to the opulence of the furniture, apart from a few silly, sentimental touches and a bit of gaudy magnificence recalling the tastes of the flower-girl who once used to stand day-dreaming in front of the shops in the arcade."

"Ensuite, Nana se mit sur Steiner, sans dégoût, mais sans tendresse. Elle le traitait de sale juif, elle semblait assouvir une haine ancienne, dont elle ne se rendait pas bien compte. Il était gros, il était bête, et elle le bousculait, avalant les morceaux doubles, voulant en finir plus vite avec ce Prussien43. Lui, avait lâché Simonne. Son affaire du Bosphore commençait à péricliter. Nana préci-pita l’écroulement par des exigences folles. Pendant un mois encore, il se débattit, faisant des miracles ; il emplissait l’Europe d’une publicité colossale, affiches, annonces, prospectus, et tirait de l’argent des pays les plus lointains. Toute cette épargne, les louis des spéculations comme les sous des pauvres gens, s’engouffrait avenue de Villiers. D’autre part, il s’était associé avec un maître de forges, en Alsace ; il y avait là-bas, dans un coin de province, des ouvriers noirs de charbon44, trempés de sueur, qui, nuit et jour, raidissaient leurs muscles et entendaient craquer leurs os, pour suffire aux plaisirs de Nana. Elle dévorait tout comme un grand feu, les vols de l’agio, les gains du travail. Cette fois, elle finit Steiner, elle le rendit au pavé, sucé jusqu’aux moelles, si vidé, qu’il resta même incapable d’inventer une coquinerie nouvelle. Dans l’effondrement de sa maison de banque, il bégayait, il tremblait à l’idée de la police. On venait de le déclarer en faillite, et le seul mot d’argent l’ahurissait, le jetait dans un embarras d’enfant, lui qui avait remué des millions. Un soir, chez elle, il se mit à pleurer, il lui demanda un emprunt de cent francs, pour payer sa bonne. Et Nana, attendrie et égayée par cette fin du terrible bonhomme qui écumait la place de Paris depuis vingt années, les lui apporta, en disant :","Then Nana leaned on Steiner, without disgust, but without tenderness. She called him a filthy Jew, she seemed to assuage an old hatred, of which she was not fully aware. He was fat, he was stupid, and she jostled him, swallowing the double pieces, wanting to finish this Prussian faster. He had dropped Simonne. His Bosphorus business was beginning to fail. Nana precipitated the collapse by mad demands. For another month he struggled, performing miracles; he filled Europe with colossal publicity, posters, announcements, prospectuses, and drew money from the most distant countries. All this savings, the louis of speculation like the pennies of poor people, was engulfed in the Avenue de Villiers. On the other hand, he had gone into partnership with a forge master in Alsace; Over there, in a corner of the province, there were workers black with coal, soaked in sweat, who, night and day, stiffened their muscles and heard their bones crack, to satisfy Nana's pleasures. It devoured everything like a great fire, the thefts of the agio, the earnings of work. This time, she finished Steiner, she returned him to the pavement, sucked to the marrow, so drained that he even remained incapable of inventing a new rascality. In the collapse of his bank house, he stuttered, he trembled at the thought of the police. He had just been declared bankrupt, and the mere word of money bewildered him, threw him into the embarrassment of a child, he who had turned over millions. One evening at her house, he began to cry, he asked her for a loan of a hundred francs to pay for his maid. And Nana, touched and amused by this end of the terrible fellow who had scoured the Place de Paris for twenty years, brought them to him, saying:","Next, Nana tackled Steiner without disgust, but also without love. She called him a dirty Jew. She seemed to be gratifying an old hatred which she could not very well explain to herself. He was fat, he was stupid, and she turned him about, taking double mouthfuls, wishing to have done with the Prussian all the quicker. He had given up Simone. His Bosphorus speculation was already in jeopardy. Nana hastened his downfall by the most lavish expenditure. For a month still he struggled, performing miracles. He covered Europe with a colossal publicity—posters, advertisements, prospectuses—and extracted money from the most distant countries. All those savings, the louis of the speculators the same as the sous of the poor people, were swallowed up in the Avenue de Villiers. He had also gone into partnership with an iron-founder in Alsace. There were there, in a corner of the country, workmen black with coal dust, bathed with perspiration, who, night and day, tightened their muscles and heard their bones crack, to supply the means for Nana’s pleasures. She devoured all like a great fire—the thefts at the Bourse, the earnings of labour. This time she finished Steiner. She returned him to the pavement, sucked to the bone, so emptied that he remained even incapable of inventing a fresh roguery. In the collapse of his banking establishment he went crazy; he trembled at the name of the police. He was made a bankrupt; and the mere word “money” bewildered him, threw him into a childish state of embarrassment—he who had handled millions. One evening when with her, he burst out crying. He asked her to lend him a hundred francs to pay his servant; and Nana, affected and amused by this ending of the terrible old man who for twenty years past had been skimming the Paris market, brought him the money, saying,","Then Nana took up with Steiner without disgust but without love. She called him a dirty Jew; she seemed to be paying back an old grudge, of which she had no distinct recollection. He was fat; he was stupid, and she got him down and took two bites at a time in order the quicker to do for this Prussian. As for him, he had thrown Simonne over. His Bosphorous scheme was getting shaky, and Nana hastened the downfall by wild expenses. For a month he struggled on, doing miracles of finance. He filled Europe with posters, advertisements and prospectuses of a colossal scheme and obtained money from the most distant climes. All these savings, the pounds of speculators and the pence of the poor, were swallowed up in the Avenue de Villiers. Again he was partner in an ironworks in Alsace, where in a small provincial town workmen, blackened with coal dust and soaked with sweat, day and night strained their sinews and heard their bones crack to satisfy Nana's pleasures. Like a huge fire she devoured all the fruits of stock-exchange swindling and the profits of labor. This time she did for Steiner; she brought him to the ground, sucked him dry to the core, left him so cleaned out that he was unable to invent a new roguery. When his bank failed he stammered and trembled at the idea of prosecution. His bankruptcy had just been published, and the simple mention of money flurried him and threw him into a childish embarrassment. And this was he who had played with millions. One evening at Nana's he began to cry and asked her for a loan of a hundred francs wherewith to pay his maidservant. And Nana, much affected and amused at the end of this terrible old man who had squeezed Paris for twenty years, brought it to him and said:","Nana next moved on to Steiner, without repugnance but equally without affection. She called him a dirty Jew, seemingly satisfying an age-old hatred which she hardly realized. He was fat and stupid and she hustled him along, keen to get shot of this Prussian as quickly as possible. He’d given up Simonne. His Bosphorus venture was beginning to look shaky, and Nana’s crazy demands hastened its demise. Miraculously, he managed to hold out for one more month, covering the whole of Europe with notices, prospectuses, and advertisements in a colossal publicity campaign, squeezing money out of the remotest countries. And all these funds, the speculators’ reserves of gold and the tiny nest-eggs of the poor, were engulfed in the Avenue de Villiers. He’d also gone into association with an iron-master in Alsace; in a corner of that province there were miners black with coal-dust and dripping in sweat who were straining their muscles and wrenching their limbs to satisfy Nana’s pleasures. She consumed everything like some great fire, the fruits of honest toil and the dishonest profits of currency sharks. This time she finished Steiner off and put him back on the street after sucking him so dry that he didn’t even have the strength to think up any further skulduggery. His bank collapsed, he went in fear and trembling of the police, he wandered around mumbling incoherently. He’d just been made bankrupt, and at the mere mention of money this man who’d been used to handling millions flew into a panic like a little child. One evening in Nana’s house he burst into tears and asked if she could lend him a hundred francs to pay his maid. Amused to see such an end to this terrible character who’d been ruthlessly exploiting the market for the last twenty years, Nana, out of the kindness of her heart, handed him the money, saying:"

"Elle siffla comme un homme. La chiffonnière, qui se trouvait sous la fenêtre, leva la tête et se montra, à la lueur jaune de sa lanterne. C'était, dans ce paquet de haillons, sous un foulard en loques, une face bleuie, couturée, avec le trou édenté de la bouche et les meurtrissures enflammées des yeux. Et, Nana, devant cette vieillesse affreuse de fille noyée dans le vin, eut un brusque souvenir, vit passer au fond des ténèbres la vision de Chamont, cette Irma d’Anglars, cette ancienne roulure comblée d’ans et d’honneurs, montant le perron de son château au milieu d’un village prosterné.

And, Nana, in front of this dreadful old age of a girl drowned in wine, had a sudden memory, saw pass in the depths of the darkness the vision of Chamont, this Irma d'Anglars, this old bum filled with years and honors, climbing the steps of his castle in the middle of a prostrate village. Then, as Satin was still whistling, laughing at the old woman who did not see her:","She whistled like a man. The rag-picker, who was under the window, raised her head and showed herself in the yellow light of her lantern. There appeared in that bundle of rags, beneath a big handkerchief in tatters, a scarred, bluish face, with the toothless aperture of the mouth and the flaming loopholes of the eyes; and Nana, in front of this frightful old age of a courtesan drowned in alcohol, beheld in the darkness the vision of Chamont—that Irma d’Anglars, the retired prostitute loaded with years and with honours, ascending the steps of her château, surrounded by a prostrate crowd of villagers. Then as Satin whistled again, amused at the old hag who could not see her, she murmured in an altered tone of voice,","She whistled a man's whistle, and the ragpicker, who was then below the window, lifted her head and showed herself by the yellow flare of her lantern. Framed among rags, a perfect bundle of them, a face looked out from under a tattered kerchief--a blue, seamed face with a toothless, cavernous mouth and fiery bruises where the eyes should be. And Nana, seeing the frightful old woman, the wanton drowned in drink, had a sudden fit of recollection and saw far back amid the shadows of consciousness the vision of Chamont-- Irma d'Anglars, the old harlot crowned with years and honors, ascending the steps in front of her chateau amid abjectly reverential villagers. Then as Satin whistled again, making game of the old hag, who could not see her:","She gave a wolf-whistle. Standing under the window in the yellow gleam of her lantern, the ragwoman looked up. From this bundle of rags wrapped in a tattered, coarse silk headscarf, her deeply seamed purple face peered out with bloodshot, ravaged eyes and toothless mouth. Confronted by this appalling old whore soaked in alcohol, in the murky background Nana had a vision of the former tart Irma d’Anglars whom she’d seen in Chamont, full of years and honours, walking up to the terrace of her manor, with the villagers bowing and scraping around her. Then, as Satin gave another whistle, still laughing at the old woman who couldn’t see her:"

"Il comprit qu’elle mentait. Mais la sensation tiède de son bras, fortement appuyé sur le sien, le laissait sans force. Il n’avait plus ni colère ni rancune de sa longue attente, son unique souci était de la garder là, maintenant qu’il la tenait. Le lendemain, il tâcherait de savoir ce qu’elle était venue faire dans sa loge.

Tomorrow, and not before, he would try and find out what she had come to her dressing room after. But Nana still appeared to hesitate; she was manifestly a prey to the sort of secret anguish that besets people when they are trying to regain lost ground and to initiate a plan of action. Accordingly, as they turned the corner of the Galerie des Varietes, she stopped in front of the show in a fan seller's window.","He saw she was lying. But the warmth of her arm pressing heavily on his own left him weak and defenceless.

"Et ce fut tout, ils ne parlèrent plus. Mais elle ne quittait pas la chambre. Un grand quart d’heure encore, elle tourna, sans voir monter l’exaspération de l’enfant, qui blêmissait de contrainte et de doute. Il jetait des coups d’œil obliques sur le salon. Que pouvaient-ils faire, pendant si longtemps ? Peut-être Nana pleurait-elle toujours. L'autre, brutal, devait lui avoir fichu des calottes25. Aussi, lorsque Zoé s’en alla enfin, courut-il à la porte, collant de nouveau son oreille. Et il resta effaré, la tête décidément perdue, car il entendait une brusque envolée de gaieté, des voix tendres qui chuchotaient, des rires étouffés de femme qu’on chatouille. D’ailleurs, presque aussitôt, Nana reconduisit Philippe jusqu’à l’escalier, avec un échange de paroles cordiales et familières.","And that was all, they spoke no more. But she did not leave the room. For a good quarter of an hour more, she turned, without seeing the exasperation of the child rising, who was turning pale with constraint and doubt. He glanced sideways around the living room. What could they do, for so long? Perhaps Nana was still crying. The other, brutal, must have given him the skullcaps. So when Zoe finally left, he ran out the door, tapping his ear again. And he remained startled, his head decidedly lost, for he heard a sudden surge of gaiety, tender whispering voices, the stifled laughter of a woman being tickled. Besides, almost immediately, Nana escorted Philippe to the stairs, with an exchange of cordial and familiar words.","And that was all. They did not speak again; but she did not leave the room. For another quarter of an hour she moved about, without noticing the exasperation of the youth, who grew pale with constraint and doubt. He gave side glances in the direction of the drawing-room. What could they be doing all that while? Perhaps Nana was still crying. The ruffian must have slapped her. So when Zoé at length went off, he ran back to the door, and again held his ear to the key-hole; and he was quite bewildered, his brain in a whirl, for he heard a sudden burst of gaiety, tender voices whispering, and the smothered laughter of a woman being tickled. But almost immediately Nana conducted Philippe to the staircase, with an interchange of cordial and familiar expressions.","And then the conversation ended; they said not another word. Still she did not leave the room. A long quarter of an hour passed, and she turned round again without seeming to notice the look of exasperation overspreading the lad's face, which was already white with the effects of uncertainty and constraint. He was casting sidelong glances in the direction of the drawing room. Maybe Nana was still crying. The other must have grown savage and have dealt her blows. Thus when Zoe finally took her departure he ran to the door and once more pressed his ear against it. He was thunderstruck; his head swam, for he heard a brisk outburst of gaiety, tender, whispering voices and the smothered giggles of a woman who is being tickled. Besides, almost directly afterward, Nana conducted Philippe to the head of the stairs, and there was an exchange of cordial and familiar phrases.","And that was all. She said nothing more but she didn’t leave the room. For a good quarter of an hour she moved around, not noticing the boy’s increasing exasperation.

Perhaps Nana was still crying? That brute in there must have smacked her face! When Zoé finally left, he rushed over and once more stuck his ear to the door. This time he was startled and completely at a loss, for he could hear bursts of laughter, whispered endearments, and stifled giggles, as if from a woman who’s being tickled. In any case, almost immediately Nana accompanied Philippe to the top of the staircase, where they parted on the friendliest of terms."

"Cependant, Fauchery s’était fait le cavalier ordinaire de la comtesse Sabine, tandis que le comte s’absentait tous les après-midi. Lorsqu’on allait au bout du parc, il portait son pliant et son ombrelle. D’ailleurs, il l’amusait par son esprit baroque 12 de petit journaliste, il la poussait à une de ces intimités soudaines, que la campagne autorise. Elle avait paru se livrer tout de suite, éveillée à une nouvelle jeunesse, en compagnie de ce garçon dont la moquerie bruyante ne semblait pouvoir la compromettre. Et, parfois, lorsqu’ils se trouvaient seuls une seconde derrière un buisson, leurs yeux se cherchaient ; ils s’arrêtaient au milieu d’un rire, brusquement sérieux, avec un regard noir, comme s’ils s’étaient pénétrés et compris.","However, Fauchery had made himself the ordinary cavalier of the Countess Sabine, while the Count was absent every afternoon. When we went to the end of the park, he carried his folding chair and his parasol. Besides, he amused her with his baroque spirit of a little journalist, he pushed her into one of those sudden intimacies that the countryside allows. She had seemed to give herself up immediately, awakened to a new youth, in the company of this boy whose noisy mockery seemed unable to compromise her. And sometimes, when they were alone for a second behind a bush, their eyes sought each other; they stopped in the middle of a laugh, suddenly serious, with a dark look, as if they had penetrated and understood each other.","Fauchery had elected himself Countess Sabine’s cavalier in waiting, whilst the count disappeared regularly every afternoon. Whenever they went about the grounds he carried her parasol and her campstool. Besides, he amused her with his journalistic gossip, and soon established between them one of those sudden intimacies which country life countenances. She appeared to surrender at once, awakened to a second youth in the society of this young man, whose noisy, scoffing ways seemed incapable of compromising her. And sometimes, when they found themselves alone for a second behind some hedge, their eyes would seek each other’s; they would stop in the midst of a laugh, abruptly serious, with a languishing look as though they had divined and understood each other.","Meanwhile Fauchery had become the Countess Sabine's faithful attendant in the absence during each afternoon of Count Muffat. Whenever they went to the end of the park he carried her campstool and her sunshade. Besides, he amused her with the original witticisms peculiar to a second-rate journalist, and in so doing he prompted her to one of those sudden intimacies which are allowable in the country. She had apparently consented to it from the first, for she had grown quite a girl again in the society of a young man whose noisy humor seemed unlikely to compromize her. But now and again, when for a second or two they found themselves alone behind the shrubs, their eyes would meet; they would pause amid their laughter, grow suddenly serious and view one another darkly, as though they had fathomed and divined their inmost hearts.","Meanwhile Fauchery had become a faithful attendant on Countess Sabine when the count had to go off and leave her every afternoon. As they walked to the end of the park, he would carry her folding chair and her sunshade. She was amused by his quirky, shallow journalist’s wit, and he was establishing with her one of those easy, casual relationships sanctioned by country customs. She appeared to have accepted this without hesitation; this young man’s boisterous jokes could surely never compromise her, and in his company she had regained her youth; now and again, when they happened to be alone for a second, hidden by a bush, in the middle of their laughter, they would suddenly break off and exchange a deep, earnest look, as if they had had a flash of insight and understanding."
"Elle était sur le point de lâcher une bêtise, dans son attendrissement. Aussi n’acheva-t-elle pas la phrase. Un instant, elle resta gênée, ne se rappelant plus où elle venait de mettre ses cinquante francs, en ôtant sa robe. Mais elle se souvint : ils devaient être au coin de la toilette, sous un pot de pommade renversé. Comme elle se levait, la sonnerie retentit longuement. Bon ! encore un ! Ça ne finirait pas. Le comte et le marquis s’étaient également mis debout, et les oreilles de ce dernier avaient remué, se pointant vers la porte ; sans doute il connaissait ces coups de sonnette. Muffat le regarda ; puis, ils détournèrent les yeux.

The count and the marquis had also risen to their feet, and the ears of the latter had moved, pointing towards the door; no doubt he knew these bells ringing. Muffat looked at him; then they looked away. They were embarrassed, they became cold again, one square and solid, with his hair strongly planted, the other straightening his thin shoulders, on which fell his crown of rare white hair.","She was on the point of saying something foolish under the influence of her emotion; but she recovered herself, and left the phrase unfinished. For a moment she remained perplexed, not recollecting where she had put the fifty francs when she took her dress off; but at length she recollected, they must be on a corner of her dressing-table under a pomatum-pot turned upside down. As she rose from her seat the bell sounded again, violently this time. Good! another one! Would it never cease? The count and the marquis had also risen, and the ears of the latter seemed to turn in the direction of the door; no doubt he knew what the frequent rings at the bell meant. Muffat glanced at him; then each looked on the ground; no doubt they were in each other’s way. But they soon regained their composure, the one looking proud and strong, his head well covered with his dark brown hair, the other straightening his bony shoulders, over which fell his meagre crown of rare white hairs.","She was on the point of being guilty of a silly speech, so melted was she at heart.

Another of them still! It would never end. The count and the marquis had both risen, too, and the ears of the latter seemed to be pricked up and, as it were, pointing toward the door; doubtless he knew that kind of ring. Muffat looked at him; then they averted their gaze mutually. They felt awkward and once more assumed their frigid bearing, the one looking square-set and solid with his thick head of hair, the other drawing back his lean shoulders, over which fell his fringe of thin white locks.","In her emotion she was about to blurt out something silly, so she left the sentence unfinished. For a moment she was embarrassed, as she’d forgotten where she’d put the fifty francs when she changed her dress.

The marquis and the count had also got to their feet; the old man’s ears had given a twitch as he listened in the direction of the door; no doubt he knew all about that sort of ring. Muffat glanced at him and they both looked away.

"Elle était dans une satisfaction d’orgueil extraordinaire. Les orfèvres avaient dit que pas une reine ne couchait dans un lit pareil. Seulement, il se présentait une complication.

He added that if she selected this second design, the goldsmiths intended to make the figure representing Night like her. This idea, which was in questionable taste, made her turn pale with pleasure. She saw herself as a little silver statue, the symbol of the tepid, voluptuous pleasures of darkness,","Her pride was flattered beyond measure. The goldsmiths had declared that no queen anywhere slept in such a bed. However, a difficulty presented itself. Labordette showed her two designs for the footboard, one of which reproduced the pattern on the sides, while the other, a subject by itself, represented Night wrapped in her veil and discovered by a faun in all her splendid nudity. He added that if she chose this last subject the goldsmiths intended making Night in her own likeness. This idea, the taste of which was rather risky, made her grow white with pleasure, and she pictured herself as a silver statuette, symbolic of the warm, voluptuous delights of darkness.","She was purring with gratification. The goldsmith had said that there wasn’t even a queen who slept in such a splendid bed. There was, however, a minor complication. Labordette showed her two sketches for the bed-end, one reproducing the bed-head motif, the other a completely different theme, a figure of Night swathed in veils which a faun was lifting up to reveal her splendid naked body. He added that if Nana chose that one, the goldsmiths proposed to depict Night in her own likeness. This spicy suggestion made Nana go pale with pleasure. She could see herself as a silver statuette symbolizing steamy nights of love …"
"Dès le second mois, la maison fut montée. Le train 17 dépassait trois cent mille francs. Il y avait huit chevaux dans les écuries, et cinq voitures dans les remises, dont un landau garni d’argent, qui occupa un instant tout Paris. Et Nana, au milieu de cette fortune, se casait, faisait son trou. Elle avait quitté le théâtre, dès la troisième représentation de la Petite Duchesse, laissant Bordenave se débattre sous une menace de faillite, malgré l’argent du comte. Pourtant, elle gardait une amertume de son insuccès. Cela s’ajoutait à la leçon de Fontan, une saleté dont elle rendait tous les hommes responsables. Aussi, maintenant, se disait-elle très forte, à l’épreuve des toquades. Mais les idées de vengeance ne tenaient guère, avec sa cervelle d’oiseau. Ce qui demeurait, en dehors des heures de colère, était, chez elle, un appétit de dépense toujours éveillé, un dédain naturel de l’homme qui payait, un continuel caprice de mangeuse et de gâcheuse, fière de la ruine de ses amants.","From the second month, the house was erected. Train 17 cost more than three hundred thousand francs. There were eight horses in the stables, and five carriages in the coach-houses, including a silver landau, which for a moment occupied all of Paris. And Nana, in the midst of this fortune, settled down, made her hole. She had left the theater after the third performance of La Petite Duchesse, leaving Bordenave to struggle under the threat of bankruptcy, despite the count's money. However, she retained a bitterness of her failure. It added to Fontan's lesson, a filth she blamed on all men. So now, she said to herself, very strong, resistant to insanity. But the ideas of revenge hardly held, with his bird brain. What remained, apart from the hours of anger, was, in her, an appetite for spending always awake, a natural disdain for the man who paid, a continual caprice of eater and waster, proud of the ruin of her lovers.","By the second month all was in working order. The expenses were at the rate of three hundred thousand francs a year. There were eight horses in the stables, and five carriages in the coach-houses. There was one especially—a landau with silver ornaments—which for a time occupied all Paris. And Nana, in the midst of this fortune, gradually settled down. She had left the theatre after the second performance of the “Little Duchess,” leaving Bordenave to struggle as best he could against threatened bankruptcy, in spite of the count’s money. All the same, she bitterly felt her failure. It added to the lesson Fontan had given her—a dirty trick for which she held all the men responsible. She now considered herself proof against all fads and infatuations; but her thoughts of vengeance did not remain for long in her flighty brain. What did remain there, however, outside her moments of anger, was an ever keen appetite for squandering money, a natural disdain for the man who paid, a perpetual caprice for devouring and destroying, a pride in the ruin of her lovers.","At the end of two months the house was set going. The cost had been more than three hundred thousand francs. There were eight horses in the stables, and five carriages in the coach houses, and of these five one was a landau with silver embellishments, which for the moment occupied the attention of all Paris. And amid this great wealth Nana began settling down and making her nest. After the third representation of the Petite Duchesse she had quitted the theater, leaving Bordenave to struggle on against a bankruptcy which, despite the count's money, was imminent. Nevertheless, she was still bitter about her failure. It added to that other bitterness, the lesson Fontan had given her, a shameful lesson for which she held all men responsible. Accordingly she now declared herself very firm and quite proof against sudden infatuations, but thoughts of vengeance took no hold of her volatile brain. What did maintain a hold on it in the hours when she was not indignant was an ever-wakeful lust of expenditure, added to a natural contempt for the man who paid and to a perpetual passion for consumption and waste, which took pride in the ruin of her lovers.","It took her less than two months to set up house. It had cost more than three-hundred thousand francs. There were eight horses in the stables and four carriages in the coachhouse, including a landau with silver fittings which for a while was the talk of Paris. And amid all this wealth, Nana was organizing her life and carving out a niche for herself. She’d abandoned the stage after the third performance of The Little Duchess, leaving Bordenave struggling under the threat of bankruptcy despite the money put up by the count. All the same, she felt embittered by her lack of success. That was something to be added to what she’d learned from Fontan, a dirty trick for which she held all males responsible. So now, she told herself, she’d be very tough and immune to passing fancies. But scatter-brained as she was, any idea of vengeance was short-lived. What did remain very much alive, apart from her occasional bursts of temper, was her wild extravagance, a natural contempt for the sucker who was stumping up, her constant urge to indulge in reckless consumption, and her pride in ruining her lovers."
"Mais Nana réclamait le silence du geste. Elle leva son verre très haut, elle dit :","But Nana demanded silence with a gesture. She raised her glass very high, she said:","But Nana motioned for silence. She held her glass high above her head, and said, “No, no, we must drink to Fontan! It’s",But with that Nana made a sign and obtained silence. She raised her glass and cried:,But Nana signalled to everybody to be quiet. She raised her glass high in the air and cried:
"Cependant, Nana nourrissait un dernier caprice. Travaillée une fois encore à l’idée de refaire sa chambre, elle croyait avoir trouvé : une chambre de velours rose thé8, à petits capitons9 d'argent, tendue jusqu’au plafond en forme de tente, garnie de cordelières et d’une dentelle d’or. Cela lui semblait devoir être riche et tendre, un fond superbe à sa peau vermeille de rousse. Mais la chambre, d’ailleurs, était simplement faite pour servir de cadre au lit, un prodige, un éblouissement. Nana rêvait un lit 10 comme il n’en existait pas, un trône, un autel, où Paris viendrait adorer sa nudité souveraine. Il serait tout en or et en argent repoussés, pareil à un grand bijou, des roses d’or jetées sur un treillis d’argent ; au chevet, une bande d’Amours, parmi les fleurs, se pencheraient avec des rires, guettant les voluptés dans l’ombre des rideaux. Elle s’était adressée à Labordette qui lui avait amené deux orfèvres. On s’occupait déjà des dessins. Le lit coûterait cinquante mille francs, et Muffat devait le lui donner pour ses étrennes.","However, Nana had one last whim. Worried once again by the idea of redoing her bedroom, she thought she had found: a bedroom of tea-pink velvet8, with small silver padding9, stretched up to the ceiling in the form of a tent, trimmed with cords and lace. Golden. It seemed to him to have to be rich and tender, a superb background to his vermilion skin. But the bedroom, moreover, was simply made to serve as a bed frame, a marvel, a dazzling sight. Nana dreamed of a bed 10 like none existed, a throne, an altar, where Paris would come to adore her sovereign nudity. It would be all in repoussé gold and silver, like a great jewel, golden roses thrown on a silver trellis; at the bedside, a band of Cupids, among the flowers, would bend over with laughter, watching for the pleasures in the shade of the curtains. She had applied to Labordette, who had brought her two goldsmiths. We were already doing the drawings. The bed would cost fifty thousand francs, and Muffat was to give it to her for her New Year's Eve.","Nana, however, still nursed a last caprice. Agitated once more with the idea of re-decorating her bed-room, she thought she had at last found something to suit her fancy—a room hung in tea-rose velvet, padded and reaching up to the ceiling, in the shape of a tent, ornamented with little silver buttons and with gold lace and cords. It seemed to her that this would look both rich and tender, a superb background to her fair skin. But the room, however, was merely to serve as a framework to the bed, a prodigy of dazzling brightness. Nana dreamed of a bed such as was never seen before—a throne, an altar, to which all Paris would come to adore her sovereign nudity. It was to be entirely of gold and silver, like an immense jewel, golden roses scattered over a silver network; at the head, a band of cupids amongst the flowers would be glancing down, with laughter on their faces, watching the voluptuous pleasures in the shadow of the curtains. She had consulted Labordette, who had brought two goldsmiths to see her. They were already preparing the drawings. The bed was to cost fifty thousand francs, and Muffat was to present her with it as a new year gift.","Meanwhile Nana had cherished her latest caprice. Once more exercised by the notion that her room needed redoing, she fancied she had hit on something at last. The room should be done in velvet of the color of tea roses, with silver buttons and golden cords, tassels and fringes, and the hangings should be caught up to the ceiling after the manner of a tent. This arrangement ought to be both rich and tender, she thought, and would form a splendid background to her blonde vermeil-tinted skin. However, the bedroom was only designed to serve as a setting to the bed, which was to be a dazzling affair, a prodigy. Nana meditated a bed such as had never before existed; it was to be a throne, an altar, whither Paris was to come in order to adore her sovereign nudity. It was to be all in gold and silver beaten work--it should suggest a great piece of jewelry with its golden roses climbing on a trelliswork of silver. On the headboard a band of Loves should peep forth laughing from amid the flowers, as though they were watching the voluptuous dalliance within the shadow of the bed curtains. Nana had applied to Labordette who had brought two goldsmiths to see her. They were already busy with the designs. The bed would cost fifty thousand francs, and Muffat was to give it her as a New Year's present.","Meanwhile Nana still had one last whim up her sleeve: she had set her heart on doing up her bedroom and she thought she had hit on a solution: a bedroom with furniture upholstered in tea-rose pink velvet with silver buttons and hangings draped in a canopy rising up to the ceiling, adorned with cable mouldings and gold lace. It seemed to her that this would be both delicate and rich, a superb backcloth for a girl with red hair and a pink skin. But the room furnishings were intended merely to provide the setting for the bedstead, which would be dazzlingly sensational. Nana had dreams of a bed that would be utterly unique, a throne or altar where all Paris would come to worship her in her naked, equally unique, beauty. It would be made entirely of embossed gold and silver, like some gigantic jewel, golden roses hanging on a silver trellis; along the bed-head a band of laughing Cupids would be leaning forward, surrounded by flowers and peering at the voluptuous delights concealed in the shade of the curtains. She had consulted Labordette, who had brought along two goldsmiths. Designs were already being drawn up. The bed would cost fifty thousand francs, and Muffat was to be giving it to her as a New Year’s gift."

"Toutes trois se penchèrent, très intéressées. Les arbres les gênaient, par moments les torches disparaissaient sous les feuilles. Elles tâchèrent d’apercevoir ces messieurs, en bas ; mais la saillie d’un balcon cachait la porte ; et elles ne distinguaient toujours que le comte Muffat, jeté sur le banc comme un paquet sombre, le visage dans son mouchoir. Une voiture s’était arrêtée, Lucy reconnut Maria Blond ; encore une qui accourait. Elle n’était pas seule, un gros homme descendait derrière elle.","All three leaned forward, very interested.

"Nana la fit taire d’un haussement d’épaules. Elle, depuis un moment, ne parlait plus, un peu pâle, très sérieuse. Brusquement, au dernier détour, comme on débouchait sur la place du village, la muraille cessa, le château parut, au fond d’une cour d’honneur. Tous s’arrêtèrent, saisis par la grandeur hautaine des larges perrons, des vingt fenêtres de façade, du développement des trois ailes dont les briques s’encadraient dans des cor-dons de pierre.

Nana, suffocated, gave a little childish sigh.","Nana checked her with a shrug of the shoulders. For some little while she had not said a word, but walked along, looking slightly pale and very serious. Suddenly, at another turn, they found themselves close to the village; the wall abruptly terminated, and the château appeared at the end of a spacious courtyard. They all stopped, lost in admiration of the lofty grandeur of the broad entrance-steps, of the twenty windows that studded the facade, of the extent of the three wings, the brick walls of which were framed with stone-work. Henri IV. had inhabited that historic building, in which his bedroom still existed, with its enormous bed hung with Genoa velvet. Nana, deeply affected, sighed like a child.","Nana silenced her with a shrug. For some moments past she had been rather pale and extremely serious and had not spoken a single word.

All stopped to admire the proud sweep of the wide steps, the twenty frontage windows, the arrangement of the three wings, which were built of brick framed by courses of stone.

Just then Nana arrived, still wearing her blue- and-white racecourse costume, and amid a thunder of applause the shallot was presented to her. People caught hold of her in her own despite, and three gentlemen bore her triumphantly into the garden, across ruined grassplots and ravaged masses of greenery. As the bandstand presented an obstacle to her advance, it was taken by storm, and chairs and music stands were smashed. A paternal police organized the disorder.","That night Nana had a huge success at Mabille. When she made her entrance around ten o’clock, the din was already terrific. This traditionally wild ball attracted all the young bloods, all the smart set falling over each other to behave as cretinously and brutishly as their footmen, packed like sardines under the festoons of gaslights. White ties, way-out clothes, the women in low-necked dresses, old ones, so that it didn’t matter if they got filthy, twisting and shrieking, crazed with drink. Even a dozen yards away from the band, the brass was barely audible. No one was dancing. Idiotic remarks were being bandied about from one stupid group to the other. People were trying hard to be funny and failing. Seven women had got locked in the cloakroom and were tearfully pleading to be let out. Someone had got hold of a shallot and started auctioning it; it fetched forty francs. At that very moment, Nana appeared, still wearing her blue-and-white race-meeting outfit. Amidst thunderous applause she was handed the shallot, and despite her protests she was hoisted up and carried in triumph out into the garden by three men crashing through the shrubbery and trampling all over the grass. When the band appeared to be in the way, they stormed it, smashing its chairs and its stands. Meanwhile the police were keeping a fatherly eye on the chaotic scene."
"Un mois plus tard, la première représentation de la Petite Duchesse fut, pour Nana, un grand désastre. Elle s’y montra atrocement mauvaise, elle eut des prétentions à la haute comédie, qui mirent le public en gaieté. On ne siffla pas, tant on s’amusait. Dans une avant-scène47, Rose Mignon accueillait d’un rire aigu chaque entrée de sa rivale, allumant ainsi la salle entière. C'était une première vengeance. Aussi, lorsque Nana, le soir, se retrouva seule avec Muffat, très chagrin, lui dit-elle furieusement :","A month later, the first performance of the Little Duchess was, for Nana, a great disaster. She showed herself to be atrociously bad, she had pretensions to high comedy, which filled the public with gaiety. We didn't whistle, we were having so much fun. In a proscenium47, Rose Mignon greeted each entry from her rival with a high-pitched laugh, lighting up the entire room. It was a first revenge. Also, when Nana, in the evening, found herself alone with Muffat, very upset, she said to him furiously:","A month later, the first performance of the “Little Duchess” was a great disaster for Nana. She was atrociously bad in it. She made pretensions to high-class comedy which filled the audience with merriment. No one hissed, they were all too much amused. Seated in one of the stage-boxes, Rose Mignon greeted each appearance of her rival with a shrill burst of laughter, thus setting off the whole house. It was a first revenge. And when, at night-time, Nana found herself alone with the count, who was very much cut up, she said to him furiously,","A month later the first night of the Petite Duchesse proved supremely disastrous to Nana. She was atrociously bad and displayed such pretentions toward high comedy that the public grew mirthful. They did not hiss--they were too amused. From a stage box Rose Mignon kept greeting her rival's successive entrances with a shrill laugh, which set the whole house off. It was the beginning of her revenge. Accordingly, when at night Nana, greatly chagrined, found herself alone with Muffat, she said furiously:","One month later, the first performance of The Little Duchess was a catastrophe for Nana. She was appalling; her pretentious efforts at high comedy aroused roars of laughter; the audience was too amused even to boo. In her stage box, Rose Mignon greeted her rival with a shrill peal of laughter each time she came on stage, which sparked off the whole house. Her vengeance was beginning. So in the evening, when Nana was at home alone with the count, who was very distressed, she said to him in a fury:"

"Et, comme chez la comtesse Sabine, on s’occupa longuement du comte de Bismarck. Vandeuvres répéta les mêmes phrases. Un instant, on fut de nouveau dans le salon des Muffat ; seules, les dames étaient changées. Justement, on passa à la musique. Puis, Foucarmont ayant laissé échapper un mot de la prise de voile dont Paris causait, Nana, intéressée, voulut absolument avoir des détails sur mademoiselle de Fougeray. Oh ! la pauvre petite, s’enterrer comme ça vivante ! Enfin, quand la vocation avait parlé ! Autour de la table, les femmes étaient très touchées. Et Georges, ennuyé d’entendre ces choses une seconde fois, interrogeait Daguenet sur les habitudes intimes de Nana, lorsque la conversation revint fatalement au comte de Bismarck. Tatan Néné se penchait à l’oreille de Labordette pour demander qui était ce Bismarck, qu’elle ne connaissait pas. Alors, Labordette, froidement, lui conta des histoires énormes : ce Bismarck mangeait de la viande crue ; quand il rencontrait une femme près de son repaire, il l’emportait sur son dos ; il avait déjà eu de cette manière trente-deux enfants, à quarante ans.","And, as with the Countess Sabine, the Count of Bismarck was occupied for a long time. Vandeuvres repeated the same phrases. For a moment they were again in the Muffats' drawing-room; only the ladies were changed. Exactly, we moved on to the music. Then, Foucarmont having let slip a word about the seizure of the veil that Paris was talking about, Nana, interested, absolutely wanted to have details about Mademoiselle de Fougeray. Oh ! poor thing, to bury herself alive like that! Finally, when the vocation had spoken! Around the table, the women were very touched. And Georges, annoyed at hearing these things a second time, was questioning Daguenet about Nana's intimate habits, when the conversation fatally returned to the Comte de Bismarck. Tatan Néné leaned into Labordette's ear to ask who this Bismarck was, whom she did not know. Then Labordette coldly told him enormous stories: this Bismarck ate raw meat; when he met a woman near his lair, he carried her on his back; he had already had thirty-two children in this way, at the age of forty.","And just the same as at Countess Sabine’s, they talked for a long while about Count Bismarck. Vandeuvres repeated the same phrases he had used before. For a moment one seemed to be again in the Muffats’ drawing-room; the women, only, were changed. In just the same way, too, the conversation turned on music. Then, Foucarmont having dropped a word about the taking of the veil which all Paris was talking of, Nana became interested and insisted on hearing all about Mademoiselle de Fougeray. Oh! poor little thing, to go and bury herself alive in that way! However, it was her own wish! The women round the table were all deeply affected. George, tired of hearing the same things over again, was questioning Daguenet respecting Nana’s private habits, when the conversation fatally returned to Count Bismarck. Tatan Néné, leaning towards Labordette and whispering in his ear, asked him who was that Bismarck, whom she had never heard of. Then, Labordette coolly told her some of the most awful lies imaginable: Bismarck fed on raw meat; whenever he encountered a woman near his stronghold, he carried her off on his back; though only forty years old, he had already had thirty-two children.","And just as at Countess Sabine's, there ensued a long discussion about Bismarck. Vandeuvres repeated the same phrases, and for a moment or two one was again in the Muffats' drawing room, the only difference being that the ladies were changed. Then, just as last night, they passed on to a discussion on music, after which, Foucarmont having let slip some mention of the assumption of the veil of which Paris was still talking, Nana grew quite interested and insisted on details about Mlle de Fougeray. Oh, the poor child, fancy her burying herself alive like that! Ah well, when it was a question of vocation! All round the table the women expressed themselves much touched, and Georges, wearied at hearing these things a second time discussed, was beginning to ask Daguenet about Nana's ways in private life, when the conversation veered fatefully back to Count Bismarck. Tatan Nene bent toward Labordette to ask him privily who this Bismarck might be, for she did not know him. Whereupon Labordette, in cold blood, told her some portentous anecdotes. This Bismarck, he said, was in the habit of eating raw meat and when he met a woman near his den would carry her off thither on his back; at forty years of age he had already had as many as thirty-two children that way.","They spent a great deal of time discussing Bismarck, exactly as Countess Sabine’s guests had. Vandeuvres produced the very same words. For a moment, it was like being at the Muffats’; only the ladies were different. And the company even went on to the subject of music. Then, as Foucarmont happened to let slip a remark about the controversial retreat into a convent of Mademoiselle de Fougeray, Nana became interested and insisted on hearing the details. Oh, the poor girl, to bury herself alive like that! But then, if she’d suddenly felt the call! The women round the table were very touched. Bored at having to listen to the same old things again, Georges was starting to question Daguenet about Nana ’s habits when the conversation again inevitably came back to Bismarck. Tatan Néné bent forward and whispered into Labordette’s ear to inquire who this man Bismarck was; she didn’t know him. Without batting an eyelid, Labordette started telling her horrendous stories: Bismarck lived on raw meat; whenever he found a woman close to his lair, he’d sling her over his back and carry her off; as a result, he’d already got thirty-two children by the age of 40 …"

"Ça se gâtait, décidément. La nuit menaçait de finir d’une façon malpropre. Dans un coin, Maria Blond s’était empoignée avec Léa de Horn qu’elle accusait de coucher avec des gens pas assez riches ; et elles en venaient aux gros mots, en s’attrapant sur leurs figures. Lucy, qui était laide, les fit taire. Ça ne signifiait rien, la figure, il fallait être bien faite. Plus loin, sur un canapé, un attaché d’ambassade avait passé un bras à la taille de Simonne, qu’il tâchait de baiser au cou ; mais Simonne, éreintée, maussade, le repoussait chaque fois avec des « Tu m’embêtes ! » et de grands coups d’éventail sur la figure. Aucune, d’ailleurs, ne voulait qu’on la touchât. Est-ce qu’on les prenait pour des filles ? Cependant, Gaga, qui avait rattrapé la Faloise, le tenait presque sur ses genoux ; tandis que Clarisse, entre deux messieurs, disparaissait, secouée d’un rire nerveux de femme qu’on chatouille. Autour du piano, le petit jeu continuait, dans un coup de folie bête ; on se poussait, chacun voulant y verser son fond de bouteille. C'était simple et gentil.","It was definitely spoiling. The night threatened to end in a messy way. In a corner, Maria Blond had a fight with Léa de Horn whom she accused of sleeping with people who were not rich enough; and they came to swear words, catching each other in their faces. Lucy, who was ugly, silenced them. It meant nothing, the figure, it had to be done well. Farther on, on a sofa, an embassy attache had put his arm around Simonne's waist, and was trying to kiss her neck; but Simonne, exhausted, sullen, pushed him away each time with ""You're bothering me!"" and big blows of the fan on the face. None of them wanted to be touched. Did we take them for girls? However, Gaga, who had caught up with La Faloise, had him almost on her knees; while Clarisse, between two gentlemen, disappeared, shaking with the nervous laughter of a woman being tickled. Around the piano, the little game continued, in a burst of stupid madness; we pushed each other, each wanting to pour his bottom of the bottle into it. It was simple and nice.","Things were decidedly going from bad to worse. The night seemed likely to end in an unpleasant kind of manner. In a corner of the room, Maria Blond was having a row with Léa de Horn, whom she accused of receiving men who were not sufficiently rich; and they had come to oaths, as they abused each other’s looks. Lucy, who was ugly, quieted them. Looks were nothing; the thing was to have a good figure. Farther off, on a sofa, an attaché to an embassy had passed his arm round Simone’s waist, and was trying to kiss her on the neck; but Simone, quite tired out, and very sulky, pushed him away each time, saying, “Don’t bother me!” and hitting him on the head with her fan. Besides, the other women would not allow anybody to touch them. Who did they take them for? Gaga, however, who had caught hold of La Faloise, kept him by her, almost on her knees; whilst Clarisse, shaking with the nervous laugh of a woman being tickled, was disappearing between two gentlemen. Around the piano the little game continued, in a fit of stupidity. There was a good deal of pushing; each one wanted to empty his bottle into it. It was simple and neat.","Decidedly the evening was becoming a big failure. The night threatened to end in the unloveliest way. In a corner by themselves Maria Blond and Lea de Horn had begun squabbling at close quarters, the former accusing the latter of consorting with people of insufficient wealth. They were getting vastly abusive over it, their chief stumbling block being the good looks of the men in question. Lucy, who was plain, got them to hold their tongues. Good looks were nothing, according to her; good figures were what was wanted. Farther off, on a sofa, an attache had slipped his arm round Simonne's waist and was trying to kiss her neck, but Simonne, sullen and thoroughly out of sorts, pushed him away at every fresh attempt with cries of ""You're pestering me!"" and sound slaps of the fan across his face. For the matter of that, not one of the ladies allowed herself to be touched. Did people take them for light women? Gaga, in the meantime, had once more caught La Faloise and had almost hoisted him upon her knees while Clarisse was disappearing from view between two gentlemen, shaking with nervous laughter as women will when they are tickled. Round about the piano they were still busy with their little game, for they were suffering from a fit of stupid imbecillty, which caused each man to jostle his fellow in his frantic desire to empty his bottle into the instrument. It was a simple process and a charming one.","Things were definitely going sour. The evening was in danger of ending nastily. Maria Blond was having a row in a corner with Léa de Horn, accusing her of going to bed with men who hadn’t got enough money, and they were starting to trade insults concerning their looks. Lucy, who was ugly, made them shut up. The face wasn’t important, it was the figure that counted. Beyond them an Embassy attaché was sitting on a settee with his arm round Simonne’s waist and trying to kiss her neck; fagged out and fed up, she was fending him off by rapping him sharply on the face each time with her fan, telling him not to be a bore. The women all wanted to be left alone: did the men take them for tarts? However, Gaga had managed to corner la Faloise again and got him almost sitting on her lap, while Clarisse, hidden between two men, was giving nervous giggles like a woman being tickled. The little game round the piano was continuing; a stupid throng of men were crazily jostling each other to tip the dregs of their bottles into it. It was simple, innocent fun."

"Il eut toutes les peines du monde à se dégager. Lui-même craignait de céder au coup de folie de cette femme, collée contre son corps, dans l’effroi contagieux de l’invisible ; et il la raisonnait, elle se portait parfaitement, elle devait simplement se bien conduire pour mériter un jour le pardon. Mais elle hochait la tête ; sans doute elle ne faisait de mal à personne ; même elle portait toujours une médaille de la Vierge, qu’elle lui montra, pendue à un fil rouge, entre les seins ; seulement, c’était réglé d’avance, toutes les femmes qui n’étaient pas mariées et qui voyaient des hommes allaient en enfer. Des lambeaux de son catéchisme lui revenaient. Ah ! si l’on avait su au juste ; mais voilà, on ne savait rien, personne ne rapportait des nouvelles ; et, vrai, ce serait stupide de se gêner, si les prêtres disaient des bêtises. Pourtant, elle baisait dévotement la médaille, toute tiède de sa peau, comme une conjuration contre la mort, dont l’idée l’emplissait d’une horreur froide.","He had all the trouble in the world to free himself. He himself was afraid of giving in to the madness of this woman, glued to his body, in the contagious dread of the invisible; and he reasoned with her, she was fine, she just had to behave well to deserve forgiveness one day. But she nodded; no doubt she did no harm to anyone; she even always wore a medallion of the Virgin, which she showed him, hanging from a red thread between her breasts; only, it was settled in advance, all the women who were not married and who saw men went to hell. Scraps of his catechism came back to him. Ah! if only we had known; but there you are, we knew nothing, no one brought any news; and, true, it would be stupid to get in each other's way if the priests were talking nonsense. Yet she devoutly kissed the medal, all warm from her skin, like a conjuration against death, the idea of which filled her with cold horror.","He had all the difficulty in the world to get free from her. He himself was afraid of succumbing to the attack of madness from which that woman, pressed to his body in the contagious fear of the invisible, was suffering; and he reasoned with her. She was in very good health, all she had to do was to conduct herself well, to merit pardon hereafter. But she shook her head. No doubt she never did harm to anyone; she even always wore a medal of the Virgin, which she showed him hanging to a red ribbon between her breasts; only it was settled beforehand, all women, who, without being married, had anything to do with men, went to hell. Fragments of her catechism were returning to her. Ah! if one only knew for certain; but there, one knew nothing, no one ever returned with news, and, really, it would be stupid to put oneself out if the priests were only talking nonsense. Yet she devoutly kissed her medal, which was all warm from its contact with her body, as a conjuration against death, the thought of which filled her with an icy terror.","He had all the trouble in the world to disengage himself. Indeed, he was himself afraid of giving in to the sudden madness of this woman clinging to his body in her dread of the Invisible. Such dread is contagious, and he reasoned with her. Her conduct was perfect--she had only to conduct herself well in order one day to merit pardon. But she shook her head. Doubtless she was doing no one any harm; nay, she was even in the constant habit of wearing a medal of the Virgin, which she showed to him as it hung by a red thread between her breasts. Only it had been foreordained that all unmarried women who held conversation with men would go to hell. Scraps of her catechism recurred to her remembrance. Ah, if one only knew for certain, but, alas, one was sure of nothing; nobody ever brought back any information, and then, truly, it would be stupid to bother oneself about things if the priests were talking foolishness all the time. Nevertheless, she religiously kissed her medal, which was still warm from contact with her skin, as though by way of charm against death, the idea of which filled her with icy horror.","He had great difficulty in pulling himself free. He himself was scared of giving way to this woman’s hysterical outburst as she clung to his body; her sudden fear of the unknown was infectious. He started reasoning with her: she was perfectly healthy, all she had to do was to behave in such a way that one day she’d earn forgiveness. She shook her head: certainly, she wasn’t doing harm to anyone and she even always wore a medallion of the Virgin Mary, which she showed him hanging on a red thread between her breasts; but it was laid down that all those women who went with men even when they weren’t married were doomed to go to Hell. Scraps of her catechism kept coming back to her. Oh, if only you could really know, but there it was, you didn’t know a thing, nobody ever came back from there to tell you anything. True enough, it would be silly if the priests were all talking nonsense … But she still kept devoutly kissing the medallion lying warm against her skin as a magic charm against death, the thought of which made her blood run cold."
"Muffat était seul, dans le silence de ce coin de maison. Comme il passait devant le foyer des artistes, il avait aperçu, par les portes ouvertes, le délabrement de la vaste pièce, honteuse de taches et d’usure au grand jour. Mais ce qui le surprenait, en sortant de l’obscurité et du tumulte de la scène, c’étaient la clarté blanche, le calme profond de cette cage d’escalier, qu’il avait vue, un soir, enfumée de gaz, sonore d’un galop de femmes lâchées à travers les étages. On sentait les loges désertes, les corridors vides, pas une âme, pas un bruit ; tandis que, par les fenêtres carrées, au ras des marches, le pâle soleil de novembre entrait, jetant des nappes jaunes où dansaient des poussières, dans la paix morte qui tombait d’en haut. Il fut heureux de ce calme et de ce silence, il monta lentement, tâchant de reprendre haleine ; son cœur battait à grands coups, une peur lui venait de se conduire comme un enfant, avec des soupirs et des larmes. Alors, sur le palier du premier étage, il s’adossa contre le mur, certain de n’être pas vu ; et, son mouchoir aux lèvres, il regardait les marches déjetées28, la rampe de fer polie par le frottement des mains, le badigeon éraflé, toute cette misère de maison de tolérance29, étalée crûment à cette heure blafarde de l’après-midi, où les filles dorment. Pourtant, comme il arrivait au second, il dut enjamber un gros chat rouge30, couché en rond sur une marche. Les yeux à demi clos, ce chat gardait seul la maison, pris de somnolence dans les odeurs enfermées et refroidies que les femmes laissaient là chaque soir.","Muffat was alone, in the silence of this corner of the house. As he passed the artists' foyer, he had seen through the open doors the dilapidated state of the vast room, shameful of stains and wear in broad daylight. But what surprised him, coming out of the darkness and the tumult of the stage, was the white light, the profound calm of this stairwell, which he had seen one evening, smoky with gas, resonant of a gallop of women let loose across the floors. One could feel the deserted boxes, the empty corridors, not a soul, not a sound; while, through the square windows, level with the steps, the pale November sun entered, throwing down yellow sheets on which the dust danced, in the dead peace which fell from above. He was happy with this calm and this silence, he climbed slowly, trying to catch his breath; his heart was pounding, he was afraid of behaving like a child, with sighs and tears. Then, on the landing of the first floor, he leaned against the wall, certain of not being seen; and, his handkerchief between his lips, he gazed at the crooked steps,28 the iron banister polished by the friction of the hands, the scratched whitewash, all this misery of a brothel29, crudely spread out at this pale hour of the afternoon, when the girls are sleeping. However, as he reached the second floor, he had to step over a big red cat,30 lying in a circle on a step. With half-closed eyes, this cat guarded the house alone, drowsy in the locked up and chilled odors that the women left there every evening.","Muffat found himself alone in this silent corner of the building. As he passed by the green-room he noticed, through the open doors, the dilapidation of the vast apartment, which, in the daylight, appeared in a disgraceful state through dirt and constant wear and tear. But what surprised him, on his leaving the noise and semi-obscurity of the stage, were the bright clear light, the intense quietude of that staircase, which he had seen one night smoky with gas and sonorous with the rush of women skurrying about from floor to floor. One could tell the dressing-rooms were unoccupied, the passages deserted, for there was not a soul, not a sound, whilst through the small square windows, on a level with the stairs, entered the pale November sun, in the yellow rays of which an infinitesimal dust disported itself, whilst a death-like peacefulness hung over all. He felt happy in this silence and calm. He mounted the stairs slowly, trying not to get out of breath; his heart bounded against his breast, and he was seized with the fear of acting like a child, with sighs and tears. Then, when he reached the first landing, he leant against the wall, certain of not being seen, and, holding his handkerchief to his mouth, he looked at the warped steps, at the iron hand-rail shining from the constant friction, at the soiled walls, at all that wretchedness which gave the place the look of some low brothel displayed in all its bareness at that drowsy hour of the afternoon when the girls are sleeping. When he arrived at the second landing he had to step over a big tortoise-shell cat curled up asleep on the top stair. With its eyes half closed, this cat watched all alone over the house, always in a state of somnolency from the cool and stuffy odours left behind there every night by the women.","Muffat was alone in that silent corner of the house. As he passed before the players' waiting room, he had peeped through the open doors and noticed the utter dilapidation of the vast chamber, which looked shamefully stained and worn in broad daylight. But what surprised him most as he emerged from the darkness and confusion of the stage was the pure, clear light and deep quiet at present pervading the lofty staircase, which one evening when he had seen it before had been bathed in gas fumes and loud with the footsteps of women scampering over the different floors. He felt that the dressing rooms were empty, the corridors deserted; not a soul was there; not a sound broke the stillness, while through the square windows on the level of the stairs the pale November sunlight filtered and cast yellow patches of light, full of dancing dust, amid the dead, peaceful air which seemed to descend from the regions above. He was glad of this calm and the silence, and he went slowly up, trying to regain breath as he went, for his heart was thumping, and he was afraid lest he might behave childishly and give way to sighs and tears. Accordingly on the first-floor landing he leaned up against a wall--for he was sure of not being observed--and pressed his handkerchief to his mouth and gazed at the warped steps, the iron balustrade bright with the friction of many hands, the scraped paint on the walls--all the squalor, in fact, which that house of tolerance so crudely displayed at the pale afternoon hour when courtesans are asleep. When he reached the second floor he had to step over a big yellow cat which was lying curled up on a step. With half-closed eyes this cat was keeping solitary watch over the house, where the close and now frozen odors which the women nightly left behind them had rendered him somnolent.","Muffat was alone in this silent corner of the building. As he’d passed by the green room, he’d seen through the open doors how run-down this huge room was, how deplorably filthy and decrepit in the full light of day. But as he moved out of the darkness and commotion of the stage, he was struck by the brightness and stillness of the stairs where one night he’d met gas-fumes and which had been resounding with pounding women’s feet as they scampered away on the various floors. He could sense the deserted dressing-rooms and empty corridors, not one single sound, not a single soul, while the pale November sun shone through the square windows set at floor-level, casting patches of yellow light dancing with dust, and a death-like peace descended from above. He was glad of this silence and calm as he went slowly up, recovering his breath; his heart was pounding and he was afraid he might start gasping and crying and behaving like a child, so on the first floor he leaned back against the wall, sure of not being observed. Holding his handkerchief to his mouth, he stood looking at the uneven stair-treads, the flaking distemper, the banister worn smooth by the rubbing of many hands, the whole brothel squalor cruelly exposed in this wan, afternoon light, the time when prostitutes are asleep. However, when he reached the second floor he had to step over a large ginger cat curled up on the stairs. With eyes half-closed, drowsy from the smells left behind every night by the women and which were now cold and fuggy, this cat was the only caretaker for the house."

People entered by twos and threes, and, after stopping at the box-office, ascended the double staircase in the rear—the women walking slowly with a swinging gait.

"Dans la rue des Martyrs, Nana sentit encore grandir sa rancune. Bien sûr, elle n’allait pas courir après Satin ; une jolie ordure, pour y mettre le nez ! Mais sa soirée se trouvait gâtée, et elle remonta lentement vers Montmartre, enragée surtout contre madame Robert. Celle-là, par exemple, avait un fameux toupet, de faire la femme distinguée ; oui, distinguée dans le coin aux épluchures ! À présent, elle était certaine de l’avoir rencontrée au Papillon, un infect bastringue de la rue des Poissonniers, où des hommes la levaient pour trente sous. Et ça empaumait 37 des chefs de bureau par des airs modestes, et ça refusait des soupers auxquels on lui faisait l’honneur de l’inviter, histoire de se poser en vertu ! Vrai, on lui en flanquerait de la vertu ! C'était toujours ces bégueules-là 38 qui s’en donnaient à crever, dans des trous ignobles que personne ne connaissait.","In the rue des Martyrs, Nana felt her resentment grow even more. Of course, she wasn't going to chase after Satin; a pretty junk, to put your nose to it! But her evening was spoiled, and she slowly went back to Montmartre, enraged above all at Madame Robert. That one, for example, had a famous quirk, of making a distinguished woman; yes, distinguished in the peeling corner! Now she was sure she had met her at the Papillon, a nasty hangout in the Rue des Poissonniers, where men picked her up for thirty sous. And it pampered office managers with modest airs, and it refused suppers to which they did it the honor of inviting it, just to pose as a virtue! True, we would give him some virtue! It was always those prudes 38 who gave themselves to dying, in despicable holes that no one knew.","In the Rue des Martyrs Nana’s rancour increased. She certainly wouldn’t go and run after Satin—she wouldn’t go near such a vile creature! But all the same her evening was spoilt, and she returned slowly towards Montmartre, feeling frightfully enraged with Madame Robert. That one certainly had a famous cheek to pretend she was a respectable woman. She was respectable enough for a dust-bin! Now she recollected perfectly of having seen her at the “Butterfly,” a foul dancing-place in the Rue des Poissonniers, where she used to sell herself for thirty sous. And she got hold of government officials by her modest ways, and she refused suppers, to which she had been honoured by an invitation, just to pretend that she was a virtuous person! Ah! she should have some virtue given her! It was always such prudes as she who got hold of the most shocking diseases, in ignoble holes that no one else knew of.","In the Rue des Martyrs Nana felt her bitterness increasing. She was certainly not going to run after Satin! It was a nice filthy business for one to be poking one's nose into! But her evening was spoiled, and she walked slowly up again toward Montmartre, raging against Mme Robert in particular. Gracious goodness, that woman had a fine cheek to go playing the lady-- yes, the lady in the dustbin! She now felt sure she had met her at the Papillon, a wretched public-house ball in the Rue des Poissonniers, where men conquered her scruples for thirty sous. And to think a thing like that got hold of important functionaries with her modest looks! And to think she refused suppers to which one did her the honor of inviting her because, forsooth, she was playing the virtuous game! Oh yes, she'd get virtued! It was always those conceited prudes who went the most fearful lengths in low corners nobody knew anything about.","In the Rue des Martyrs, Nana could feel her resentment growing. Naturally, there was no question of her chasing after that little rat Satin who wasn’t fit to be touched by a bargepole! But her evening had been spoiled and she walked slowly back to Montmartre feeling particularly angry with Madame Robert. The cheek of that bloody woman, pretending to be so distinguished, oh yes, she was distinguished all right, a distinguished bit of garbage! She now felt certain she’d met her in Le Papillon, a revolting dive in the Rue des Poissonniers where men could pick her up for a couple of francs. And that slut was bamboozling heads of departments, putting on her prim and proper act, and turning down supper invitations that people were kind enough to make just to appear respectable! What fun it’d be to kick a bit of respectability into her up her backside, it really would! It’s prudes like that who get themselves stuffed till they’re silly in filthy dumps that decent people didn’t know existed."

"Du coup, Bordenave commença à se fâcher. Il répéta le mot idiot, chercha quelque chose de plus fort, trouva imbécile et crétin. On sifflerait, l’acte ne finirait pas. Et comme Fauchery, exaspéré, sans d’ailleurs se blesser autrement de ces gros mots qui revenaient entre eux à chaque pièce nouvelle, le traitait carrément de brute, Bordenave perdit toute mesure. Il faisait le moulinet avec sa canne, il soufflait comme un bœuf, criant :","Suddenly, Bordenave began to get angry. He repeated the word idiot, looked for something stronger, found himself imbecile and moron. We would whistle, the act would not end.

It would be hissed, they would never be allowed to finish the act; and as Fauchery, exasperated though not particularly offended by his abuse, which occurred each time they rehearsed a new piece together, roundly called him a brute, Bordenave lost all control over himself. He twirled his stick in his hand, and breathing like a mad bull, exclaimed:","Bordenave began to get angry at once. He repeated the word ""idiotic"" and, seeking a more forcible expression, hit upon ""imbecile"" and ""damned foolish."" The public would hiss, and the act would never be finished! And when Fauchery, without, indeed, being very deeply wounded by these big phrases, which always recurred when a new piece was being put on, grew savage and called the other a brute, Bordenave went beyond all bounds, brandished his cane in the air, snorted like a bull and shouted:","Bordenave was annoyed. He repeated the word ‘idiotic’ and then, looking for something more forceful, produced ‘imbecilic’ and ‘cretinous’. It would be booed, they’d never get to the end of the act.

"Il tâchait de prendre un air naturel, en étudiant du coin de l’œil l’effet de ses paroles sur le comte. Celui-ci tournait de nouveau sa petite cuiller, comme rassuré.

The latter was twirling his spoon again as though reassured. The countess, her eyes fixed dreamily on the blue distances of the park, seemed to have lost all interest in the conversation. The shadow of a smile on her lips, she seemed to be following up a secret thought which had been suddenly awakened within her. Estelle, on the other hand, sitting stiffly on her chair, had heard all that had been said about Nana, but her white, virginal face had not betrayed a trace of emotion.","He was trying to speak in a natural tone of voice, checking the count’s reaction out of the corner of his eye.

"Mais ils durent se tourner. Daguenet leur souriait. Maintenant que Nana avait réussi, il ne se cachait plus, il venait de triompher dans les couloirs. À son côté, le jeune échappé de collège n’avait pas quitté son fauteuil, dans la stupeur d’admiration où Nana le plongeait. C'était ça, c’était la femme ; et il devenait très rouge, il mettait et retirait machinalement ses gants. Puis, comme son voisin avait causé de Nana, il osa l’interroger.","But they had to turn. Daguenet smiled at them. Now that Nana had succeeded, he was no longer hiding, he had just triumphed in the corridors. At his side, the young college dropout had not left his armchair, in the stupor of admiration into which Nana plunged him. That was it, that was the woman; and he was getting very red, he put on and took off his gloves mechanically. Then, as his neighbor had talked about Nana, he ventured to question her.","As they turned round, Daguenet smiled at them. Now that Nana had proved a success, he no longer kept himself in the background; he had just returned from wandering about the house and enjoying her triumph. The youngster, fresh from college, beside him had not once quitted his seat, so overpowering was the state of admiration into which the sight of Nana had plunged him. So that, then, was woman! and he blushed deeply, and kept taking off and putting on his gloves mechanically. At last, as his neighbour had talked about Nana, he ventured to question him.","But they had to turn round, for Daguenet was smiling at them. Now that Nana had had a success he no longer hid himself: indeed, he had just been scoring triumphs in the passages. By his side was the young truant schoolboy, who had not quitted his seat, so stupefying was the state of admiration into which Nana had plunged him. That was it, he thought; that was the woman! And he blushed as he thought so and dragged his gloves on and off mechanically. Then since his neighbor had spoken of Nana, he ventured to question him.","But they had to turn round; Daguenet was smiling at them. Now that Nana had scored a triumph, he was no longer lurking; in fact, he’d just been enjoying his own triumph in the corridor. Beside him the young truant, completely overcome with admiration for Nana, hadn’t left his seat. Ah, that’s what people mean when they talk of a real woman! He was going very red and he kept mechanically pulling on and taking off his gloves. Then, hearing his neighbour mention Nana, he ventured to ask:"
"« Vous dites qu’il y a du monde ? reprit Nana, toujours assise, se reposant.","“You say there are people? resumed Nana, still seated, resting.","“You say there are some people waiting?” resumed Nana, still sitting down, resting.","""You say there's company there?"" continued Nana, still sitting on the chair and resting herself.","‘You said there were people waiting?’ Nana said, still relaxing in her chair."
"Alors, ces dames l’assirent au milieu. Mais il fallut une seconde chaise pour sa jambe. Deux femmes soulevèrent sa jambe, l’allongèrent délicatement. Ça ne faisait rien, il mangerait de côté.","So these ladies set him in the middle. But it took a second chair for his leg. Two women lifted his leg, lengthened it delicately. It didn't matter, he would eat on the side.","Then the ladies seated him in the place indicated; but he required a second chair for his leg. Two of the women raised the injured limb and carefully placed it out straight. It didn’t matter, he would only have to eat sideways.","Thereupon the ladies seated him in the middle.

"« De qui est-il, ce bébé ? » dit-elle en s’interrompant, les yeux allumés d’une curiosité aiguë.","“Who is this baby from? she said, pausing, her eyes lit with acute curiosity.","“Who is the father of your baby?” she asked, suddenly interrupting her sermon, her eyes lighted up with intense curiosity.","""Who is the baby's father?"" she said, interrupting herself, her eyes lit up with an expression of acute curiosity.","‘Who’s the father?’ she asked suddenly, breaking off with a glint of curiosity in her eye."
"Puis, refermant les paupières, elle parut morte. Une ombre d’angoisse profonde avait passé sur le visage de Muffat. Dans le coup qui le frappait, il oubliait, depuis la veille, des embarras d’argent, dont il ne savait comment sortir. Malgré des promesses formelles, le billet de cent mille francs, renouvelé une première fois, venait d’être mis en circulation ; et Labordette, affectant le désespoir, rejetait tout sur Francis, disait qu’il ne lui arriverait plus de se compromettre dans une affaire, avec un homme de peu d’éducation. Il fallait payer, jamais le comte n’aurait laissé protester sa signature. Puis, outre les nouvelles exigences de Nana, c’était chez lui un gâchis de dépenses extraordinaires. Au retour des Fondettes, la comtesse 5 avait brusquement montré un goût de luxe, un appétit de jouissances mondaines, qui dévorait leur fortune. On commençait à parler de ses caprices ruineux, tout un nouveau train de maison, cinq cent mille francs gaspillés à transformer le vieil hôtel de la rue Miromesnil, et des toilettes excessives, et des sommes considérables disparues, fondues, données peut-être, sans qu’elle se souciât d’en rendre compte. Deux fois, Muffat s’était permis des observations, voulant savoir ; mais elle l’avait regardé d’un air si singulier, en souriant, qu’il n’osait plus l’interroger, de peur d’une réponse trop nette. S'il acceptait Daguenet comme gendre de la main de Nana, c’était surtout avec l’idée de pouvoir réduire la dot d’Estelle à deux cent mille francs quitte à prendre pour le reste des arrangements avec le jeune homme, heureux encore de ce mariage inespéré.","Then, closing her eyes, she appeared dead. A shadow of deep anguish passed over Muffat's face. In the blow which struck him, he forgot, since the day before, the embarrassments of money, from which he did not know how to get out. In spite of formal promises, the note of one hundred thousand francs, renewed for the first time, had just been put into circulation; and Labordette, affecting despair, threw everything back on Francis, saying that it would never again happen to him to compromise himself in an affair with a man of little education. It was necessary to pay, the count would never have allowed his signature to be protested. Then, besides Nana's new demands, it was a mess of extraordinary expenses at home. On their return from Fondettes, the Countess had suddenly shown a taste for luxury, an appetite for worldly pleasures, which devoured their fortune. People were beginning to talk about his ruinous whims, a whole new housekeeping, five hundred thousand francs wasted transforming the old hotel in the rue Miromesnil, and excessive toilets, and considerable sums disappeared, melted down, given away perhaps, without that she cared to report it. Twice Muffat had made observations, wanting to know; but she had looked at him with such a singular air, smiling, that he no longer dared to question her, for fear of too straightforward an answer. If he accepted Daguenet as son-in-law from Nana's hand, it was above all with the idea of being able to reduce Estelle's dowry to two hundred thousand francs, even if it meant making arrangements for the rest with the young man, still happy to this unexpected marriage.","Then, closing her eyes again, she appeared as though dead. A shade of intense anguish overspread Muffat’s face. In the blow that had come upon him, he had forgotten, ever since the night before, the monetary difficulties from which he no longer knew how to extricate himself. In spite of the most distinct promises, his note for a hundred thousand francs, already renewed once, had been put into circulation; and Labordette, affecting to be greatly vexed, made out it was all Francis’s fault, and said that he would never again compromise himself in an affair with an uneducated man. It would have to be paid, the count would never let his note be protested. Then, besides Nana’s innumerable claims, there was a most wasteful expenditure going on in his own home. On their return from Les Fondettes, the countess had suddenly developed a taste for luxury, an appetite for worldly enjoyments, which were rapidly devouring their fortune. People were beginning to talk of her ruinous caprices, a complete change of her household, five hundred thousand francs frittered away in transforming the old house in the Rue Miromesnil, and extravagant costumes, and large sums of money that had disappeared, melted, or been given away perhaps, without her troubling herself to render the least account. Twice Muffat had ventured to make some observations, being desirous of knowing; but she had looked at him so peculiarly, smiling the while, that he did not dare to ask any questions for fear of receiving too plain an answer. If he accepted Daguenet as a son-in-law from Nana, it was especially with the idea of being able to reduce Estelle’s dowry to two hundred thousand francs, and of making arrangements respecting the balance with the young man, who would be only too delighted at such an unexpectedly good marriage.","Then she shut her eyes again and looked like one dead. A shadow of deep anguish had passed over Muffat's brow. Under the present stroke he had since yesterday forgotten the money troubles from which he knew not how to escape. Despite formal promises to the contrary, the bill for a hundred thousand francs had been put in circulation after being once renewed, and Labordette, pretending to be very miserable about it, threw all the blame on Francis, declaring that he would never again mix himself up in such a matter with an uneducated man. It was necessary to pay, for the count would never have allowed his signature to be protested. Then in addition to Nana's novel demands, his home expenses were extraordinarily confused. On their return from Les Fondettes the countess had suddenly manifested a taste for luxury, a longing for worldly pleasures, which was devouring their fortune. Her ruinous caprices began to be talked about. Their whole household management was altered, and five hundred thousand francs were squandered in utterly transforming the old house in the Rue Miromesnil. Then there were extravagantly magnificent gowns and large sums disappeared, squandered or perhaps given away, without her ever dreaming of accounting for them. Twice Muffat ventured to mention this, for he was anxious to know how the money went, but on these occasions she had smiled and gazed at him with so singular an expression that he dared not interrogate her further for fear of a too-unmistakable answer. If he were taking Daguenet as son-in-law as a gift from Nana it was chiefly with the hope of being able to reduce Estelle's dower to two hundred thousand francs and of then being free to make any arrangements he chose about the remainder with a young man who was still rejoicing in this unexpected match.","And she shut her eyes again and lay completely inanimate. An agonized look clouded Muffat’s face; in a state of shock from yesterday’s events, he’d temporarily forgotten his financial troubles from which he could see hardly any way to extricate himself. In spite of the most solemn assurances he’d received, his hundred-thousand-franc promissory note had been put into circulation. Labordette was pretending to be utterly dismayed and blaming everything on Francis; he’d take good care not to have any future business dealings with someone who wasn’t a gentleman. But the note had to be met; the count would never allow his signature to be questioned. However, apart from Nana’s fresh demands, his domestic expenditure had suffered an extraordinary upheaval. After coming back from Les Fondettes, the countess had suddenly manifested a taste for luxury and an appetite for social pleasures which was running away with their fortune. People were beginning to talk about her compulsive spending, a whole new and ruinous style of living, half-a-million francs squandered on doing up their old house in the Rue Miromesnil, her extravagant wardrobe and vast sums that had disappeared, melting, or perhaps given, away without any effort to provide justification. Twice Muffat had ventured to comment on her behaviour in an endeavour to discover what was happening, but she’d merely smiled and given him such an odd look that he’d been too intimidated to ask any further questions: her answers might have been too forthright. His acceptance of Daguenet as son-in-law had been motivated primarily by the thought of reducing Estelle’s dowry to two hundred thousand francs, even if that involved reaching some agreement on the remainder with the young man, who was quite content to be making this marriage which was like a dream come true."
"— Ah ! je vais te dire. La pluie m’a pris en chemin. Et puis, je n’ai pas voulu remonter jusqu’à Gumières, et en traversant la Choue, je suis tombé dans un sacré trou d’eau. »","- Oh! I'll tell you.

"Comme le prince descendait le petit escalier de bois, un bruit étrange, des jurons étouffés, des piétinements de lutte, éclataient de l’autre côté du théâtre.

Ils se roulaient par terre, derrière un portant, en se traitant de maquereaux.","As the prince descended the little wooden staircase, a strange noise, muffled oaths, stampings of struggle, broke out from the other side of the theatre. It was a whole story that scared the artists waiting for their response. For a moment Mignon had been joking again, showering Fauchery with caresses. He had just invented a little game, he applied flicks to his nose, to protect him from flies, he said. Naturally, this game greatly entertained the artists. But suddenly Mignon, carried away by his success, throwing himself into a fantasy, gave the journalist a slap in the face, a real and vigorous slap. This time, he was going too far, Fauchery could not, in front of the world, laughingly accept such a slap. And the two men, ceasing the comedy, livid and with faces bursting with hatred, had jumped at each other's throats. They were rolling on the ground, behind a rack, calling each other pimps.","As the prince descended the little wooden staircase, a strange noise, a mixture of stifled oaths and stampings of feet as of men struggling, reached him from the other side of the theatre. It was caused by an occurrence that quite scared the actors and actresses awaiting their cues. For some little while Mignon had been amusing himself again by overwhelming Fauchery with delicate attentions. He had just imagined a little game, which consisted in every now and then snapping his fingers close to the journalistic nose, to keep the flies off, as he said. This little business naturally amused the onlookers immensely. But suddenly, Mignon, carried away by his success, taking a greater interest in the performance, gave the journalist what was really a blow, and a good hard blow too. This time he had gone too far. Fauchery could not, in the presence of the others, smilingly receive such a punch on the nose. And the two men, putting an end to the comedy, their faces livid and full of hate, had sprung at each others’ throats. They rolled about the stage, behind one of the side-scenes, calling each other the vilest names imaginable.","As the prince was coming down the little wooden staircase a strange sound of smothered oaths and stamping, scuffling feet became audible on the other side of the theater. The actors waiting for their cues were being scared by quite a serious episode. For some seconds past Mignon had been renewing his jokes and smothering Fauchery with caresses. He had at last invented a little game of a novel kind and had begun flicking the other's nose in order, as he phrased it, to keep the flies off him. This kind of game naturally diverted the actors to any extent. But success had suddenly thrown Mignon off his balance. He had launched forth into extravagant courses and had given the journalist a box on the ear, an actual, a vigorous, box on the ear. This time he had gone too far: in the presence of so many spectators it was impossible for Fauchery to pocket such a blow with laughing equanimity. Whereupon the two men had desisted from their farce, had sprung at one another's throats, their faces livid with hate, and were now rolling over and over behind a set of side lights, pounding away at each other as though they weren't breakable.","As the prince was going down the wooden staircase, a strange sound of scuffling and swearing came from the other side of the theatre. Something very odd was happening; the actors waiting to go on stage were watching in dismay. Mignon had just been getting at Fauchery again with his affectionate digs and nudges. His latest little trick was giving him light taps on the nose, claiming it was to keep off the flies. Naturally the cast was highly amused. Then all of a sudden, excited by his success, he let his imagination take over and he gave the journalist not just a tap but a really hard punch. This time he’d gone too far. In front of so many people Fauchery couldn’t laugh off a blow like that. Dropping their mask, the two men, livid, their faces contorted with rage and hatred, had flung themselves at each other’s throats. They were rolling about on the ground behind the framework of a flat, calling each other pimps."

Assis sur leur séant, côte à côte, la couverture au ventre, les oreillers tassés derrière le dos, ils soupaient, en causant de la petite femme. Nana la trouvait laide et sans chic.

Sitting on their backs, side by side, the blanket over their stomachs, the pillows heaped behind their backs, they were having supper, talking about the little woman.

Sitting up in bed, side by side, with the clothes well over them, and the pillows piled up behind, they talked of the little woman as they supped. Nana thought her ugly and quite without go.

"Le jour grandissait. Une lueur louche, d’une affreuse tristesse, entrait par les fenêtres. Alors, le départ commença, une débandade pleine de malaise et d’aigreur.

And Mignon having cleaned up Vandeuvres, the household left without worrying about Steiner, after having invited Fauchery again for the next day. Lucy, then, refused to allow herself to be escorted by the journalist, whom she sent aloud to her cabotine. Suddenly, Rose, who had turned around, replied with a “Dirty crane! between the teeth.

They never knew how to behave themselves; they were always most disgusting from the first. And Mignon having quite stumped Vandeuvres, the couple went off, without troubling themselves about Steiner, though not until they had again invited Fauchery for the morrow. Lucy, then, refused to let the journalist see her home, and told him out loud to go with his dirty actress. Rose, who heard her, turned round, and answered with “Filthy hag!” muttered between her teeth; but Mignon, well versed in women’s quarrels, paternally pushed his wife outside, and told her to dry up. Behind them, Lucy, all alone, descended the staircase like a queen. Then it was La Faloise, feeling quite ill and sobbing like a child, who was led away by Gaga, whilst he called for Clarisse, long ago gone off with her two gentlemen. Simone also had disappeared. There still remained Tatan, Léa, and Maria; but Labordette obligingly offered to take charge of them.","The day was breaking apace. An uncertain glimmer of light, fraught with a poignant melancholy, came stealing through the windows. And with that the guests began to take their departure. It was a most sour and uncomfortable retreat. Caroline Hequet, annoyed at the loss of her night, announced that it was high time to be off unless you were anxious to assist at some pretty scenes. Rose pouted as if her womanly character had been compromised. It was always so with these girls; they didn't know how to behave and were guilty of disgusting conduct when they made their first appearance in society! And Mignon having cleaned Vandeuvres out completely, the family took their departure. They did not trouble about Steiner but renewed their invitation for tomorrow to Fauchery. Lucy thereupon refused the journalist's escort home and sent him back shrilly to his ""strolling actress. "" At this Rose turned round immediately and hissed out a ""Dirty sow"" by way of answer. But Mignon, who in feminine quarrels was always paternal, for his experience was a long one and rendered him superior to them, had already pushed her out of the house, telling her at the same time to have done. Lucy came downstairs in solitary state behind them. After which Gaga had to carry off La Faloise, ill, sobbing like a child, calling after Clarisse, who had long since gone off with her two gentlemen. Simonne, too, had vanished. Indeed, none remained save Tatan, Lea and Maria, whom Labordette complaisantly took under his charge.","Outside it was growing lighter. A sinister gleam, unbelievably sad, was filtering in through the windows. People were beginning to leave; it was a disorderly, uneasy retreat, full of ill temper. Fed up at having wasted her night, Caroline said it was high time to go if you weren’t anxious to see some queer things happen. Rose gave her a black look, like a woman caught in an embarrassing situation: these young tarts were always like that, they never knew how to behave , they were just plain disgusting when they were starting their careers. And as Mignon had cleaned Vandeuvres out, the couple left without worrying about Steiner, after repeating their invitation to Fauchery for the following day. Hearing this, Lucy refused to let the journalist take her home, telling him to go back to his stage hack. At that Rose swung round and hissed: ‘Dirty whore!’ between her teeth. But with his experience of women’s quarrels, Mignon, never at a loss, was exerting his fatherly authority to shepherd her out through the door, telling her to cut it out. Lucy went down the stairs behind them, by herself, with all the dignity of a queen. Then Gaga had to take la Faloise off, queasy and sobbing like a child, calling for Clarisse who’d slipped away with the two young gentlemen a long time ago. Simonne had disappeared too. Only Tatan, Léa, and Maria were left, all of whom Labordette obligingly agreed to look after."

Quand il la sentit ainsi, quand il la retrouva avec le velours de ses membres, sous l’étoffe mince de sa robe, une convulsion le secoua ; et il grelottait la fièvre, éperdu, se meurtrissant davantage contre ses jambes, comme s’il avait voulu entrer en elle.

The old chair creaked, and beneath the low ceiling, where the air was pungent with stale perfumes, smothered sobs of desire were audible.","But he was already doing so. He’d fallen at her feet and seized her round the waist, hugging her tightly and pressing his face hard into her flesh between her knees. When he felt her body, when he recognized her velvety thighs through her thin dress, a convulsive shudder ran through his body and he started desperately shivering as if in a fever, pressing his face harder and harder against her legs as though wanting to force his way into her, between her thighs. The old chair was creaking. He was moaning with lust; the sound rose up to the low ceiling to be smothered in the sour reek of stale scent."

"Alors, Rose Mignon parla des diamants du shah. Il portait une tunique entièrement couverte de pierreries, une merveille, un astre flambant, qui représentait des millions.

"Le gardien les avait laissés entrer dans l’enceinte du pesage, n’osant arrêter cette femme au bras du comte. Nana, toute gonflée de poser enfin le pied sur cette terre défendue, s’étudiait, marchait avec lenteur, devant les dames assises au pied des tribunes. C'était, sur dix rangées de chaises, une masse profonde de toilettes, mêlant leurs couleurs vives dans la gaieté du plein air ; des chaises s’écartaient, des cercles familiers se formaient au hasard des rencontres, comme sous un quinconce 39 de jardin public, avec des enfants lâchés, courant d’un groupe à un autre ; et, plus haut, les tribunes étageaient leurs gradins chargés de foule, où les étoffes claires se fondaient dans l’ombre fine des charpentes. Nana dévisageait ces dames. Elle affecta de regarder fixement la comtesse Sabine. Puis, comme elle passait devant la tribune impériale, la vue de Muffat, debout près de l’impératrice, dans sa raideur officielle, l’égaya.","The watchman had let them into the weighing enclosure, not daring to stop this woman on the count's arm. Nana, all swollen at finally setting foot on this forbidden ground, studied herself, walked slowly, in front of the ladies seated at the foot of the stands. It was, on ten rows of chairs, a deep mass of toilets, mingling their bright colors in the gaiety of the open air; chairs moved apart, familiar circles formed as they met randomly, as if under a staggered row in a public garden, with children loose, running from one group to another; and, higher up, the stands raised their steps loaded with crowds, where the light fabrics blended into the fine shadow of the framework. Nana stared at these ladies. She affected to gaze fixedly at the Countess Sabine. Then, as she passed the Imperial tribune, the sight of Muffat standing beside the Empress, in her official stiffness, cheered her up.","The gatekeeper had permitted them to enter the enclosure, not daring to stop the woman on the count’s arm. Nana, full of pride on at length placing her foot on that forbidden spot, studied her poses, and walked slowly along in front of the ladies seated at the foot of the stands. On ten rows of chairs there was a deep mass of elegant costumes, blending their gay colours in the open air. Chairs were turned round; friends had formed into groups just as they chanced to meet, the same as in some public garden, with children playing around; and, higher up, the tiers of the stands were filled to overflowing, whilst the delicate framework cast its shadows over the light-coloured garments. Nana stared at the ladies. She made a point of looking fixedly at Countess Sabine. Then as she passed in front of the imperial pavilion, the sight of Muffat, standing up near the Empress, in all his official dignity, amused her immensely.","The man at the gate, not daring to stop the woman hanging on the count's arm, had allowed them to enter the enclosure. Nana, greatly puffed up at the thought that at last she was setting foot on the forbidden ground, put on her best behavior and walked slowly by the ladies seated at the foot of the stands. On ten rows of chairs the toilets were densely massed, and in the blithe open air their bright colors mingled harmoniously. Chairs were scattered about, and as people met one another friendly circles were formed, just as though the company had been sitting under the trees in a public garden. Children had been allowed to go free and were running from group to group, while over head the stands rose tier above crowded tier and the light-colored dresses therein faded into the delicate shadows of the timberwork. Nana stared at all these ladies. She stared steadily and markedly at the Countess Sabine. After which, as she was passing in front of the imperial stand, the sight of Muffat, looming in all his official stiffness by the side of the empress, made her very merry.","The gatekeeper let them through into the paddock, not daring to stop a woman who was arm-in-arm with the count. As she strolled along in front of the ladies seated at the foot of the grandstands, Nana was carefully calculating her effect and gloating at having finally broken into this forbidden sanctum. These ladies were packed in a solid mass on ten rows of chairs, their brilliant dresses matching their cheerful enjoyment of being in the open air. Chairs were being shifted round, friends were meeting unexpectedly and gathering round in circles as they do under the clumps of trees in public gardens, while their children were going off by themselves, running from one group to the other. Higher up in the packed grandstands, the bright dresses melted into the shadows cast by the pillars supporting the tiers of seats. Nana was staring at these ladies and made a particular point of scrutinizing Countess Sabine. As she passed in front of the Imperial grandstand, she was greatly amused to see Muffat, looking rigidly official, standing close to the Empress."

"Nana, en quelques mois, les mangea goulûment, les uns après les autres. Les besoins croissants de son luxe enrageaient ses appétits, elle nettoyait un homme d’un coup de dent. D’abord, elle eut Foucarmont qui ne dura pas quinze jours. Il rêvait de quitter la marine, il avait amassé en dix années de voyages une trentaine de mille francs qu’il voulait risquer aux États-Unis ; et ses instincts de prudence, d’avarice même, furent emportés, il donna tout, jusqu’à des signatures sur des billets de complaisance, engageant son avenir. Lorsque Nana le poussa dehors, il était nu. D’ailleurs, elle se montra très bonne, elle lui conseilla de retourner sur son bateau. À quoi bon s’entêter ? Puisqu’il n’avait plus d’argent, ce n’était plus possible. Il devait comprendre et se montrer raisonnable. Un homme ruiné tombait de ses mains comme un fruit mûr, pour se pourrir à terre, de lui-même.","Nana, in a few months, ate them greedily, one after the other. The growing needs of her luxury enraged her appetites, she cleaned a man with a bite. First, she had Foucarmont, which did not last a fortnight. He dreamed of leaving the navy, he had amassed in ten years of travels some thirty thousand francs which he wanted to risk in the United States; and his instincts of prudence, even of avarice, were carried away, he gave everything, even signatures on promissory notes, committing his future. When Nana pushed him out, he was naked. Besides, she was very good, she advised him to return to his boat. Why be stubborn? Since he had no more money, it was no longer possible. He had to understand and be reasonable. A ruined man fell from his hands like a ripe fruit, to rot on the ground, by himself.","In a few months Nana devoured them greedily, one after the other. The increasing requirements of her luxury whetted her appetite, she cleaned a man out with the craunchbe of her teeth. First, she had Foucarmont, who did not last a fortnight. He had dreamed of leaving the navy. In ten years of a seafaring life he had saved some thirty thousand francs, which he wanted to risk in the United States; and his prudent and even miserly instincts were silenced—he gave all, even his signature to accommodation bills, thus affecting his future. When Nana turned him adrift, he was penniless. However, she showed herself very kind-hearted—she advised him to return to his ship. What was the use of being obstinate? As he had no money left, he could not possibly remain with her. He ought to understand that and be reasonable. A ruined man fell from her hands like ripe fruit, to rot on the earth all by himself.","Nana in a few months finished them up greedily, one after the other. The growing needs entailed by her luxurious way of life only added fuel to her desires, and she finished a man up at one mouthful. First she had Foucarmont, who did not last a fortnight. He was thinking of leaving the navy, having saved about thirty thousand francs in his ten years of service, which he wished to invest in the United States. His instincts, which were prudential, even miserly, were conquered; he gave her everything, even his signature to notes of hand, which pledged his future. When Nana had done with him he was penniless. But then she proved very kind; she advised him to return to his ship. What was the good of getting angry? Since he had no money their relations were no longer possible. He ought to understand that and to be reasonable. A ruined man fell from her hands like a ripe fruit, to rot on the ground by himself.","In the space of a few months Nana gobbled them up one by one; her luxurious tastes had sharpened her appetite; she could clean them out in one bite. It was Foucarmont’s turn first; he didn’t even last a fortnight. He’d been hoping to retire from the navy, and over his last ten years at sea had managed to put by thirty thousand or so francs to use for speculation in the United States; but his instinctive caution, or indeed miserliness, was thrown to the winds and he gave her everything, even signing bills of credit mortgaging his future. When Nana discarded him, he was penniless. But she was very kind to him and advised him to go back to his ship: what was the point of persisting? Now he was broke, they couldn’t possibly stay together, he must surely realize that and be sensible. A ruined man dropped through her fingers like a ripe fruit, to rot quietly on the ground, by himself."

Une somnolence de veille prolongée s’y alourdissait, sous la lumière trouble des lampes, dont les mèches charbonnées rougissaient les globes. Ces dames en étaient à l’heure de mélancolie vague où elles éprouvaient le besoin de raconter leur histoire. Blanche de Sivry parlait de son grand-père, le général, tandis que Clarisse inventait un roman, un duc qui l’avait séduite chez son oncle, où il venait chasser le sanglier ; et toutes deux, le dos tourné, haussaient les épaules, en demandant s’il était Dieu possible de conter des blagues pareilles.

"Puis, elle retomba dans sa contemplation, sans un geste, sans une parole. Tout à l’heure, on pourrait la regarder peut-être ; et les trois femmes rejoignirent les autres devant la cheminée. Simonne et Clarisse discutaient sur les diamants de la morte, à voix basse. Enfin, existaient-ils, ces diamants ? personne ne les avait vus, ça devait être une blague. Mais Léa de Horn connaissait quelqu’un qui les connaissait ; oh ! des pierres monstrueuses ! D’ailleurs, ce n’était pas tout, elle avait rapporté bien d’autres richesses de Russie, des étoffes brodées, des bibelots précieux, un service de table en or, jusqu’à des meubles ; oui, ma chère, cinquante-deux colis, des caisses énormes, de quoi charger trois wagons. Ça restait en gare. Hein ? pas de chance, mourir sans avoir même le temps de déballer ses affaires, et ajoutez qu’elle avait des sous avec ça, quelque chose comme un million. Lucy demanda qui hériterait. Des parents éloignés, la tante sans doute. Une jolie tuile pour cette vieille. Elle ne savait rien encore, la malade s’était obstinée à ne pas la faire prévenir, lui gardant rancune de la mort de son petit. Alors, toutes s’apitoyèrent sur le petit, en se souvenant de l’avoir aperçu aux courses : un bébé plein de mal, et qui avait l’air si vieux et si triste ; enfin un de ces pauvres mioches qui n’ont pas demandé à naître.","Then she fell back into her contemplation, without a gesture, without a word.

It stayed at the station. Eh ? bad luck, dying without even having time to unpack her things, and add that she had money with it, something like a million. Lucy asked who would inherit. Distant relatives, probably the aunt. A pretty tile for this old woman. She didn't know anything yet, the patient had stubbornly refused to let her know, bearing a grudge against her for the death of her child. So everyone felt sorry for the little one, remembering having seen him at the races: a baby full of pain, and who looked so old and so sad; finally one of those poor brats who did not ask to be born.","And she returned to her contemplation, without a gesture, without a word. Perhaps they would be able to look at her by-and-by; and the three women joined the others in front of the fire-place.

Lucy inquired who would inherit it all. Some distant relatives, the aunt very likely. A fine windfall for that old woman. She knew nothing yet; the invalid obstinately refused to have her informed, bearing her some ill-will for the death of her youngster. Then they all pitied the little fellow, as they recollected having seen him at the races—a baby full of disease, and who looked so sad and so old; in short, one of those poor brats who never wanted to be born.","Then she once more lapsed into contemplation and neither moved nor spoke.

But Léa de Horn knew somebody who had actually seen them; oh, they were absolutely gigantic … And that wasn’t the lot , she’d brought all sorts of precious things back from Russia, embroidered cloth, valuable trinkets, a golden dinnerservice, even furniture; yes, my dear, fifty-two enormous crates, enough to fill three railway wagons. It was all being held at the station. Bad luck, wasn’t it? Dying without even having time to unpack; and don’t forget, she had masses of money as well, something like a million. Lucy asked who would be inheriting it all. Distant relatives, no doubt the aunt. An ill wind that’d be blowing a lot of good to that old woman. She didn’t know anything about it yet, the sick woman had insisted on not letting her know because the death of her son Louis still rankled.

"Mais Nana, immobile, ne répondit pas. Après un premier acte, où l’auteur posait comme quoi 16 le duc de Beaurivage trompait sa femme avec la blonde Géraldine, une étoile d’opérettes, on voyait, au second acte, la duchesse Hélène venir chez l’actrice, un soir de bal masqué, pour apprendre par quel magique pouvoir ces dames conquéraient et retenaient leurs maris17. C’était un cousin, le bel Oscar de Saint-Firmin, qui l’introduisait, espérant la débaucher. Et, comme première leçon, à sa grande surprise, elle entendait Géraldine faire une querelle de charretier au duc, très souple, l’air enchanté ; ce qui lui arrachait ce cri : « Ah bien ! si c’est ainsi qu’il faut parler aux hommes ! » Géraldine n’avait guère que cette scène dans l’acte. Quant à la duchesse, elle ne tardait pas à être punie de sa curiosité : un vieux beau, le baron de Tardiveau, la prenait pour une cocotte 18 et se montrait très vif ; tandis que, de l’autre côté, sur une chaise longue, Beaurivage faisait la paix avec Géraldine en l’embrassant. Comme le rôle de cette dernière n’était pas distribué, le père Cossard s’était levé pour le lire, et il y mettait des intentions malgré lui, il figurait, dans les bras de Bosc. On en était à cette scène, la répétition traînait sur un ton maussade, lorsque Fauchery tout d’un coup sauta de son fauteuil. Il s’était contenu jusque-là, mais ses nerfs l’emportaient.","But Nana, motionless, did not answer. After a first act, where the author posed that the Duc de Beaurivage was cheating on his wife with the blonde Géraldine, a star of operettas, we saw, in the second act, the Duchess Hélène coming to the actress, one evening in masked ball, to learn by what magical power these ladies conquered and retained their husbands. It was a cousin, the handsome Oscar de Saint-Firmin, who introduced her, hoping to poach her. And, as a first lesson, to her great surprise, she heard Geraldine make a carter's quarrel with the duke, very supple, with an enchanted air; which wrung from him this cry: “Ah bien! if this is the way to speak to men! Géraldine had little more than this scene in the act. As for the Duchess, it was not long before she was punished for her curiosity: an old beau, the Baron de Tardiveau, took her for a cocotte18 and showed himself to be very lively; while, on the other side, on a chaise-longue, Beaurivage was making peace with Geraldine by kissing her. As the role of the latter was not distributed, Father Cossard had risen to read it, and he put intentions into it in spite of himself, it appeared in the arms of Bosc. We were at this scene, the rehearsal was dragging on in a sullen tone, when Fauchery suddenly jumped out of his chair. He had contained himself until then, but his nerves prevailed.","But Nana neither answered nor moved. After the first act, in which the author made the Duke de Beaurivage deceive his wife with the fair Géraldine, an operatic star, came the second act, where the Duchess Hélène went to the actress’s on the night of a masked ball, to learn by what magic power such creatures conquered and retained the husbands of better women. It was a cousin, the handsome Oscar de Saint-Firmin, who introduced her there, hoping to seduce her. And, to her great surprise, as a first lesson she heard Géraldine abusing the duke in the language of a navvie, whilst the latter seemed to be delighted; this sight drew from her the cry, “Ah, well! if that’s the way the men must be spoken to!” This was about the only scene Géraldine had in the act. As for the duchess, she was soon punished for her curiousity. An old beau, the Baron de Tardiveau, took her for one of the gay women and attacked her vigorously, whilst, on the other side, Beaurivage made it up with Géraldine, who was reclining in an easy chair, and kissed her. As the part of the latter was not filled up, old Cossard had risen to read it, and he accentuated certain passages in spite of himself, and acted in Bosc’s arms. They had reached this scene, the rehearsal dragged on tediously, when suddenly Fauchery jumped up from his chair. He had restrained himself till then, but his nerves had at length got the better of him.","But Nana sat motionless and vouchsafed no reply. After the first act, in which the author showed how the Duc de Beaurivage played his wife false with the blonde Geraldine, a comic-opera celebrity, the second act witnessed the Duchess Helene's arrival at the house of the actress on the occasion of a masked ball being given by the latter. The duchess has come to find out by what magical process ladies of that sort conquer and retain their husbands' affections. A cousin, the handsome Oscar de Saint-Firmin, introduces her and hopes to be able to debauch her. And her first lesson causes her great surprise, for she hears Geraldine swearing like a hodman at the duke, who suffers with most ecstatic submissiveness. The episode causes her to cry out, ""Dear me, if that's the way one ought to talk to the men!"" Geraldine had scarce any other scene in the act save this one. As to the duchess, she is very soon punished for her curiosity, for an old buck, the Baron de Tardiveau, takes her for a courtesan and becomes very gallant, while on her other side Beaurivage sits on a lounging chair and makes his peace with Geraldine by dint of kisses and caresses. As this last lady's part had not yet been assigned to anyone, Father Cossard had got up to read it, and he was now figuring away in Bosc's arms and emphasizing it despite himself. At this point, while the rehearsal was dragging monotonously on, Fauchery suddenly jumped from his chair. He had restrained himself up to that moment, but now his nerves got the better of him.","Nana sat still and didn’t reply. After the first act, which showed the Due de Beaurivage deceiving his wife with the blonde Géraldine, an operetta star, in the second act the Duchess Hélène goes to a masked ball in the singer’s house to discover by what magic such ladies bewitched and held on to other women’s husbands. She is taken along by the handsome Oscar de Saint-Firmin who hopes to seduce her himself. The first lesson she learns comes when, to her great surprise, she hears Géraldine abusing the duke like a fishwife while he laps it up delightedly, leading her to exclaim: ‘Well, if that’s the way you need to talk to men! …’ This was practically Géraldine’s only scene in the whole act. As for the duchess, it didn’t take long before she was punished for her curiosity: mistaking her for a tart, an old buck, the Baron de Tardiveau, becomes very pressing while on a couch on the other side of the stage Beaurivage makes his peace with Géraldine by giving her a kiss. As the part hadn’t yet been allotted to anybody old Cossard had gone over to read it and, in spite of himself, was interpreting it, acting it out in Bosc’s arms. They’d just reached that part of the scene and the rehearsal was dragging miserably on, when suddenly Fauchery shot out of his chair. Till now he’d been able to restrain himself but his nerves could stand it no longer."

"Les deux vieilles dames s’étaient assises de nouveau, baissant la voix, causant du mariage, qui étonnait bien des gens. Estelle venait de passer, en robe de soie rose, toujours maigre et plate, avec sa face muette de vierge. Elle avait accepté Daguenet, paisiblement ; elle ne témoignait ni joie ni tristesse, aussi froide, aussi blanche que les soirs d’hiver où elle mettait des bûches au feu. Toute cette fête donnée pour elle, ces lumières, ces fleurs, cette musique, la laissaient sans une émotion.","The two old ladies sat down again, lowering their voices, talking about the marriage, which astonished many people. Estelle had just passed by, in a pink silk dress, still thin and flat, with her mute virgin face. She had accepted Daguenet peacefully; she showed neither joy nor sadness, as cold, as white as the winter evenings when she put logs on the fire. All this party given for her, these lights, these flowers, this music, left her without a single emotion.","The two old ladies had sat down again, and lowering their voices, they talked of the marriage, which surprised many people. Estelle had just passed, in a pink silk dress, still flat and thin, with her expressionless virgin face. She had accepted Daguenet quietly; she showed neither joy nor sadness, but remained as cold and pale as on those winter nights when she used to put the logs of wood on the fire. All this entertainment given for her, these illuminations, these flowers, this music, left her cold.","The two old ladies had again sat down and with lowered tones began talking about the marriage, which was causing astonishment to a good many people. Estelle had just passed by them. She was in a pink silk gown and was as pale, flat, silent and virginal as ever.

This whole fete given in her honor, these lights and flowers and tunes, left her quite unmoved.","The two old ladies had sat down again and were talking in low voices about the marriage, which had taken a lot of people by surprise.

She’d raised absolutely no objection to her marriage to Daguenet, showing neither sadness nor gladness, as cold and white as those winter nights when she used to put more logs on the fire. This party in her honour, with all these lights and flowers and music, left her completely unmoved."
"Dès lors, Nana eut réellement sa maison montée21. Le personnel était complet, à l’écurie, à l’office et dans la chambre de madame. Zoé organisait tout, sortait des complications les plus imprévues ; c’était machiné comme un théâtre, réglé comme une grande administration ; et cela fonctionnait avec une précision telle, que, pendant les premiers mois, il n’y eut pas de heurts ni de détraquements. Seulement, madame donnait trop de mal à Zoé, par des imprudences, des coups de tête, des bravades folles. Aussi la femme de chambre se relâchait-elle peu à peu, ayant remarqué d’ailleurs qu’elle tirait de plus gros profits des heures de gâchis, quand madame avait fait une bêtise qu’il fallait réparer. Alors, les cadeaux pleuvaient, elle pêchait des louis 22 dans l’eau trouble.","From then on, Nana really had her house set up21. The staff was complete, in the stable, in the pantry and in the lady's room. Zoé organized everything, got out of the most unforeseen complications; it was contrived like a theatre, regulated like a great administration; and it worked with such precision that, during the first months, there were no clashes or breakdowns. Only Madame was giving Zoe too much trouble, by imprudence, headbutting, mad bravado. So the maid relaxed little by little, having noticed, moreover, that she derived greater profits from the hours of waste, when Madame had made a mistake that had to be repaired. So the gifts rained down, she fished for 22 louis in the murky water.","Then Nana’s establishment was indeed complete. Nothing was wanting, either in the stables, the kitchen, or the bedroom. Zoé, who had the general management, found means of escape out of the most difficult entanglements. There was a kind of machinery in everything, as at a theatre. All was regulated as in a government office, and it worked with such precision, that for some months there was no hitch—nothing got out of gear. Only madame gave Zoé an immense deal of trouble, through her imprudence, her fads, and her foolish bravados. So the maid ended by being less careful, seeing that she made a far larger profit when anything had gone wrong—whenever madame had committed some new piece of stupidity that needed being set right. Then it rained presents, and she hooked louis in the troubled waters.","From that time forth Nana's house was really properly appointed. The staff of servants was complete in the stable, in the kitchen and in my lady's chamber. Zoe organized everything and passed successfully through the most unforeseen difficulties. The household moved as easily as the scenery in a theater and was regulated like a grand administrative concern. Indeed, it worked with such precision that during the early months there were no jars and no derangements. Madame, however, pained Zoe extremely with her imprudent acts, her sudden fits of unwisdom, her mad bravado. Still the lady's maid grew gradually lenient, for she had noticed that she made increased profits in seasons of wanton waste when Madame had committed a folly which must be made up for. It was then that the presents began raining on her, and she fished up many a louis out of the troubled waters.","Nana was now completely set up. Her stables and servants’ hall were staffed; she had her own personal maid. Zoé supervised everything, coping with the most unforeseen complications; it was a well-oiled machine, like a theatre or the management of a large business. It functioned so perfectly that for the first few months there were no mishaps or hitches. The only trouble was that madam was making life difficult for Zoé by her fecklessness, impulsiveness, and downright foolhardiness. So much so that the chambermaid gradually started to take things more easily, having meanwhile observed that she earned more from crises, when her mistress had done something silly that had to be put right. On these occasions she was showered with presents; fishing in troubled waters was bringing rich rewards."
"Daguenet la ramena, la retint un instant par la main. Il avait pris sa voix de cristal, une voix aux notes d’harmonica qui faisait tout son succès auprès de ces dames.","Daguenet brought her back, held her for a moment by the hand. He had taken on his crystal voice, a voice with harmonica notes that made him so popular with these ladies.","Daguenet walked with her towards her room, and then held her for a moment by the hand. He assumed his crystal-toned voice—a voice that sounded like a harmonica, and which was the cause of his great success among the ladies.","Daguenet drew her forward again and held her hand for a second or two. He adopted his crystalline tone of voice, the voice with notes as sweet as those of a harmonica, which had gained him his success among the ladies of Nana's type.","Daguenet caught hold of her hand for a second, drawing her closer. He’d put on his silvery voice, like the sound of a glass harmonica, which women found so irresistible."

"Alors, tout en adorant son chéri, son chien aimé, avec une passion d’autant plus aveugle qu’elle payait à cette heure, Nana retomba dans la crotte du début. Elle roula, elle battit le pavé de ses anciennes savates de petit torchon, en quête d’une pièce de cent sous56. Un dimanche, au marché La Rochefoucauld, elle avait fait la paix avec Satin, après s'être jetée sur elle, en lui reprochant madame Robert, furieusement. Mais Satin se contentait de répondre que, lorsqu’on n’aimait pas une chose, ce n’était pas une raison pour vouloir en dégoûter les autres. Et Nana, d’esprit large, cédant à cette idée philosophique qu’on ne sait jamais par où l’on finira, avait pardonné. Même, la curiosité mise en éveil, elle la questionnait sur des coins de vice, stupéfiée d’en apprendre encore à son âge, après tout ce qu’elle savait ; et elle riait, elle s’exclamait, trouvant ça drôle, un peu répugnée cependant, car au fond elle était bourgeoise pour ce qui n’entrait pas dans ses habitudes. Aussi retourna-t-elle chez Laure, mangeant là, lorsque Fontan dînait en ville. Elle s’y amusait des histoires, des amours et des jalousies qui passionnaient les clientes, sans leur faire perdre un coup de fourchette. Pourtant, elle n'en 57 était toujours pas, comme elle disait. La grosse Laure, avec sa maternité attendrie, l’invitait souvent à passer quelques jours dans sa villa d’Asnières, une maison de campagne, où il y avait des chambres pour sept dames. Elle refusait, elle avait peur. Mais Satin lui ayant juré qu’elle se trompait, que des messieurs de Paris vous balançaient 58 et j ouaient au tonneau59, elle promit pour plus tard, quand elle pourrait s’absenter.","So, while adoring her darling, her beloved dog, with a passion all the more blind that she was paying at this hour, Nana fell back into the shit of the beginning. She rolled, she pounded the pavement with her old little cloth slippers, looking for a hundred-sou piece. One Sunday, at the La Rochefoucauld market, she had made peace with Satin, after throwing herself on her, reproaching her furiously for Madame Robert. But Satin contented herself with replying that, when you didn't like something, that was no reason to want to disgust others with it. And Nana, broad-minded, yielding to this philosophical idea that you never know where you will end up, had forgiven. Even, curiosity aroused, she questioned her about corners of vice, stupefied to learn more at her age, after all she knew; and she laughed, she exclaimed, finding it funny, a little repugnant however, because deep down she was bourgeois for what was not in her habits. So she returned to Laure's, eating there when Fontan dined in town. She amused herself with the stories, the loves and the jealousies that fascinated the customers, without making them miss a beat. However, she was still not 57, as she said. Fat Laure, with her tender motherhood, often invited her to spend a few days in her villa at Asnières, a country house, where there were rooms for seven ladies. She refused, she was afraid. But Satin having sworn to her that she was mistaken, that gentlemen from Paris were throwing you around and throwing barrels at you,59 she promised for later, when she could be absent.","Then, whilst adoring her darling, her dear love, with a passion all the more blinding as it was she who now paid for all, Nana reverted again to the depravity of her early days. She walked the streets as she did when a young girl in quest of a five francs piece. One Sunday, at the Rochefoucauld market, she made it up with Satin, after flying at her and bullying her on account of Madame Robert. But Satin merely replied that when one did not like a thing, one had no right to seek to disgust others with it; and Nana, who was by no means narrow-minded, yielded to the philosophical idea that one never knows how one may end, and forgave her. And her curiosity being awakened, she even questioned her in regard to some details of vice, amazed at learning something fresh at her age, after all she knew. She laughed, and thought it very funny, yet feeling all the time a slight repugnance, for at heart she was rather conservative in her habits. She often went to Laure’s when Fontan dined out. She was amused with the stories she heard there, with the loves and the jealousies which had so much interest for the other customers, though they never caused them to lose a mouthful. However she was never mixed up with them, as she said. Stout Laure, with her maternal affection, often invited her to spend a few days at her villa at Asnieres—a country house where there were rooms for seven ladies. She declined —she was afraid; but Satin having declared to her that she was mistaken, that gentlemen from Paris would swing them and play at different games in the garden with them, she promised to come later on, as soon as she was able to get away.","In due course Nana's very adoration of her darling, her dear old duck, which was all the more passionately blind, seeing that now she paid for everything, plunged her back into the muddiest depths of her calling. She roamed the streets and loitered on the pavement in quest of a five-franc piece, just as when she was a slipshod baggage years ago. One Sunday at La Rochefoucauld Market she had made her peace with Satin after having flown at her with furious reproaches about Mme Robert. But Satin had been content to answer that when one didn't like a thing there was no reason why one should want to disgust others with it. And Nana, who was by way of being wide- minded, had accepted the philosophic view that you never can tell where your tastes will lead you and had forgiven her. Her curiosity was even excited, and she began questioning her about obscure vices and was astounded to be adding to her information at her time of life and with her knowledge. She burst out laughing and gave vent to various expressions of surprise. It struck her as so queer, and yet she was a little shocked by it, for she was really quite the philistine outside the pale of her own habits. So she went back to Laure's and fed there when Fontan was dining out. She derived much amusement from the stories and the amours and the jealousies which inflamed the female customers without hindering their appetites in the slightest degree. Nevertheless, she still was not quite in it, as she herself phrased it. The vast Laure, meltingly maternal as ever, used often to invite her to pass a day or two at her Asnieries Villa, a country house containing seven spare bedrooms. But she used to refuse; she was afraid. Satin, however, swore she was mistaken about it, that gentlemen from Paris swung you in swings and played tonneau with you, and so she promised to come at some future time when it would be possible for her to leave town.","So, still adoring her darling man, her pet lamb, with a passion all the blinder now that it was she who was paying, Nana fell back into the gutter where she had started, prowling around the streets as she had when, as a down-at-heel little slut, she’d been glad to lay hands on a five-franc piece. One Sunday, at the La Rochefoucauld market, after meeting Satin and furiously telling her off because of Madame Robert, Nana had made it up with her. Satin’s only comment had been that if you didn’t like doing something yourself, that was no reason to stop anyone else enjoying themselves. And acting on the philosophical principle that you never knew what you might end up doing yourself, Nana had broad-mindedly forgiven her. She even began to feel curious herself about certain odd little secret corners of vice and questioned her on them, amazed at all the things she had to learn at her age, over and above what she already knew; and she laughed, uttering little exclamations and finding it funny, even if a little off-putting, because at heart she was deeply conventional in any matter that didn’t form part of her own habits. As a result, when Fontan wasn’t going to be dining at home, she went back to eat at Laure’s. She was intrigued by the love affairs and jealouses and other happenings which aroused the emotions of Laure’s female customers without in any way impairing their appetites. All the same, she wasn’t one of them, yet, as she put it. Massive and motherly, Laure kept issuing affectionate invitations for her to spend a few days in her villa at Asnières,* a country house with seven bedrooms for lady guests. Nana was scared and refused. But when Satin assured her that she’d got it wrong, and that she’d find gentlemen from Paris there who’d play pigs-in-clover with you and push your swing for you, she promised she’d go later, when she could get away."

"Nana était enceinte de trois mois. Longtemps elle avait cru à une indisposition ; le docteur Boutarel lui-même doutait. Puis, quand il se prononça nettement, elle éprouva un tel ennui, qu’elle fit tout au monde pour dissimuler sa grossesse. Ses peurs nerveuses, ses humeurs noires venaient un peu de cette aventure, dont elle gardait le secret, avec une honte de fille mère forcée de cacher son état. Cela lui semblait un accident ridicule, quelque chose qui la diminuait et dont on l’aurait plaisantée. Hein ? la mauvaise blague ! pas de veine, vraiment ! Il fallait qu’elle fût pincée, quand elle croyait que c’était fini. Et elle avait une continuelle surprise, comme dérangée dans son sexe ; ça faisait donc des enfants, même lorsqu’on ne voulait plus et qu’on employait ça à d’autres affaires ? La nature l’exaspérait, cette maternité grave qui se levait dans son plaisir, cette vie donnée au milieu de toutes les morts qu’elle semait autour d’elle. Est-ce qu’on n’aurait pas dû disposer de soi à sa fantaisie, sans tant d’histoires ? Ainsi, d’où tombait-il, ce mioche ? Elle ne pouvait seulement le dire. Ah ! Dieu ! celui qui l’avait fait, aurait eu une riche idée en le gardant pour lui, car personne ne le réclamait, il gênait tout le monde, et il n’aurait bien sûr pas beaucoup de bonheur dans l’existence.","Nana was three months pregnant. For a long time she had believed in an indisposition; Doctor Boutarel himself doubted. Then, when he pronounced himself clearly, she felt so annoyed that she did everything in the world to conceal her pregnancy. Her nervous fears, her dark moods came a little from this adventure, the secret of which she kept, with the shame of a single mother forced to hide her condition. It seemed to her a ridiculous accident, something that diminished her and that she would have been joked about. Eh ? bad joke! bad luck, really! She had to be pinched, when she thought it was over. And she had a continual surprise, as if disturbed in her sex; So it made children, even when you didn't want it any more and used it for other things? Nature exasperated her, this grave motherhood which rose in her pleasure, this life given in the midst of all the deaths which she sowed around her. Shouldn't one have disposed of oneself as one pleases, without so much fuss? So, where did he fall from, this brat? She couldn't just tell. Ah! God ! whoever had made it, would have had a rich idea in keeping it for himself, because no one claimed him, he bothered everyone, and he would of course not have much happiness in existence.","Nana was three months enceinte. For a long time she had thought she was merely unwell; Dr. Boutarel himself had doubts. Then, when he was able to say for certain, she was so vexed that she did everything she could to hide her condition. It seemed to her a most ridiculous mishap, something which lowered her in her own estimation, and about which everyone would have chaffed her. What a wretched joke! she had no luck, really! It was just her misfortune to be caught when she thought she was quite safe. And she experienced a constant surprise, as though disturbed in her sex. What! one got children even when one did not want them, and had another object in view? Nature exasperated her—that grave maternity which rose in the midst of her pleasures, that new life quickening when she was sowing so many deaths around her. Ought not one to be able to dispose of oneself as one liked without all that fuss? Now, who did the brat spring from? She could not for the soul of her tell. No one had asked for it, it was in everybody’s way, and it would not meet with much happiness in life, that was quite certain!","Nana had been in the family way for the past three months. For long she had simply thought herself out of sorts, and Dr Boutarel had himself been in doubt. But when afterward he made her a decisive announcement, she felt so bored thereby that she did all she possibly could to disguise her condition. Her nervous terrors, her dark humors, sprang to some extent from this unfortunate state of things, the secret of which she kept very shamefacedly, as became a courtesan mother who is obliged to conceal her plight. The thing struck her as a ridiculous accident, which made her appear small in her own eyes and would, had it been known, have led people to chaff her. ""A poor joke, eh?"" she said. ""Bad luck, too, certainly."" She was necessarily very sharp set when she thought her last hour had come. There was no end to her surprise, too; her sexual economy seemed to her to have got out of order; it produced children then even when one did not want them and when one employed it for quite other purposes! Nature drove her to exasperation; this appearance of serious motherhood in a career of pleasure, this gift of life amid all the deaths she was spreading around, exasperated her. Why could one not dispose of oneself as fancy dictated, without all this fuss? And whence had this brat come? She could not even suggest a father. Ah, dear heaven, the man who made him would have a splendid notion had he kept him in his own hands, for nobody asked for him; he was in everybody's way, and he would certainly not have much happiness in life!","Nana was three months pregnant. For a while she’d taken it to be merely a passing indisposition, and Doctor Boutarel himself had his doubts. When he finally told her definitely, she was so annoyed that she made every effort to conceal the fact. Her predicament had been the root cause of her black moods and nervous fears; she felt ashamed and was anxious to keep it quiet, like any unmarried mother forced to hide her condition. It was a ridiculous and humiliating accident which would make her a laughing-stock. What a rotten sort of joke! And what bad luck, too! Just when she thought she’d finished with all that kind of lark, she had to be caught out! And she had a permanent feeling of surprise, as if her sex organs had let her down: so they produced babies even when you didn’t want them to and were using them for quite other purposes? Nature really was infuriating! You were enjoying a bit of fun and had to face up to the serious business of becoming a mother. Nature was making people die all around you and then forcing you to give life. Oughtn’t you to be allowed to use your body as your fancy took you without having all that fuss? And where on earth had this little brat come from? She didn’t even know. The man responsible would have done better to keep it to himself, for God’s sake, because no one would claim the child, it was an embarrassment for all concerned and his life would certainly not have been very happy."

"Vingt fois, elle avait conté les descentes que les agents faisaient dans les hôtels. Et justement, cette nuit-là, en se réfugiant rue de Laval, ni l’une ni l’autre ne s’était méfiée. Au mot de police, Nana avait perdu la tête. Elle sauta du lit, courut à travers la chambre, ouvrit la fenêtre, de l’air égaré d’une folle qui va se précipiter. Mais, heureusement, la petite cour était vitrée ; un grillage en fil de fer se trouvait là, de plain-pied. Alors, elle n’hésita point, elle enjamba l’appui et disparut dans le noir, la chemise volante, les cuisses à l’air de la nuit.","Twenty times she had told of the raids that agents made on hotels.

But, fortunately, the little courtyard was covered in with glass, and over this was a wire net-work on a level with the window. She did not hesitate, but, stepping on to the sill, disappeared in the darkness, her chemise blowing about her, and her bare legs exposed to the keen night air.","Often had she told stories about the raids on hotel made by the plainclothes men.

"Elle était exaspérée de cette surprise. Jamais elle ne cédait ainsi chez elle, dans ce salon, les portes ouvertes.

She had never before given way in such a manner at home, in that parlour with the doors unfastened.

Whenever he entered Nana's bedroom he was simply content to open the windows for a second or two in order to get rid of the odors the others left behind them, the essential smells of fair-haired men and dark, the smoke of cigars, of which the pungency choked him. This bedroom was becoming a veritable thoroughfare, so continually were boots wiped on its threshold. Yet never a man among them was stopped by the bloodstain barring the door. Zoe was still preoccupied by this stain; it was a simple mania with her, for she was a clean girl, and it horrified her to see it always there. Despite everything her eyes would wander in its direction, and she now never entered Madame's room without remarking:","Muffat had resigned himself to accepting the other men, but in an effort to retain some last remnant of dignity he expected to be treated with respect by the servants and by the regular visitors to the Avenue de Villiers; he wanted to show that, as the chief provider, he was her official lover. His passion for Nana never weakened and he maintained his position by paying; it cost him a lot, even for a smile; he was also fleeced and never got value for money; but it was like some dread disease and he couldn’t cure himself. When he went into Nana’s bedroom, he merely opened the windows for a moment to get rid of the smell of other people, the stench of all the men, fair-haired or dark, the acrid cigar-smoke that stifled him. The bedroom was being made into a public right-of-way; lots of feet were being wiped on the doorstep and none was deterred by the blood-stain on the threshold. This stain had become a permanent challenge to Zoé, an obsession for a tidy-minded girl irritated that it wouldn’t go away; she found it impossible to take her eyes off it, and every time she went into her mistress’s bedroom she’d say:"
"« Est-ce embêtant, il faut que je sorte à trois heures ! murmura-t-elle. En voilà une corvée ! »","“Is it annoying, I have to go out at three o'clock! she whispered. That's a chore! »",“What a nuisance it is: I have to go out at three o’lock!” she murmured. “It’s an awful bore!”,"""Isn't it a bore I've got to go out at three o'clock?"" she muttered.

"Mais quelqu’un la touchait par-derrière, et elle fut surprise, en se retournant, d’apercevoir Mignon sur la banquette. Elle disparut un instant, elle s’assit à son côté, car il venait lui communiquer une chose grave. Mignon disait partout que sa femme était ridicule d’en vouloir à Nana ; il trouvait ça bête et inutile.","But someone touched her from behind, and she was surprised, turning round, to see Mignon on the seat.

She slipped down out of sight for a second and took a seat beside him.

"« Les agents, souffla-t-elle. Hue donc ! hue donc ! » Ce fut, au milieu de la cohue, une course folle. Des jupes fuyaient, se déchiraient. Il y eut des coups et des cris. Une femme tomba. La foule regardait avec des rires la brutale agression des agents, qui, rapidement, resserraient leur cercle. Cependant, Nana avait perdu Satin. Les jambes mortes, elle allait sûrement être arrêtée, lorsqu’un homme, l’ayant prise à son bras, l’emmena devant les agents furieux. C'était Prullière qui venait de la reconnaître. Sans parler, il tourna avec elle dans la rue Rougemont, alors déserte, où elle put souffler, si défaillante, qu’il dut la soutenir. Elle ne le remerciait seulement pas.","“The agents,” she breathed. Boo then! boo! It was, in the midst of the crush, a mad dash. Skirts leaked, tore. There were knocks and shouts. A woman fell. The crowd watched with laughter as the officers brutally attacked, quickly closing their circle. However, Nana had lost Satin. Her legs dead, she was surely going to be arrested, when a man, having taken her by his arm, led her away in front of the furious agents. It was Prullière who had just recognized her. Without speaking, he turned with her into the Rue Rougemont, then deserted, where she could breathe, so faint that he had to hold her up. She just wasn't thanking him.","“The police!” panted her friend. “Hurry up! hurry up!” There was a headlong rush through the crowd; skirts were torn in their flight—there were blows and cries, a woman fell to the ground. The mob laughingly looked on at the brutal onslaught of the police, who rapidly contracted their circle. Nana, however, had soon lost sight of Satin. She felt her legs failing her; she was on the point of being caught, when a man, taking her arm in his, led her off in the face of the infuriated policemen. It was Prullière, who had just at that moment recognised her. Without speaking, he turned with her down the Rue Rougemont, which was almost deserted, where she was able to take breath; but she felt so faint, that he had to support her. She did not even thank him.","""It's the plain-clothes men!"" whispered Satin. ""Off with you! Off with you!"" A wild stampede took place amid the surging crowd. Skirts streamed out behind and were torn. There were blows and shrieks. A woman fell down. The crowd of bystanders stood hilariously watching this rough police raid while the plain-clothes men rapidly narrowed their circle. Meanwhile Nana had lost Satin. Her legs were failing her, and she would have been taken up for a certainty had not a man caught her by the arm and led her away in front of the angry police. It was Prulliere, and he had just recognized her. Without saying a word he turned down the Rue Rougemont with her. It was just then quite deserted, and she was able to regain breath there, but at first her faintness and exhaustion were such that he had to support her. She did not even thank him.","‘The cops! Get cracking!’ Everyone was joining in a wild stampede through the crowd. Skirts were swirling and getting torn; people were shouting, blows were being struck. A woman fell over. The crowd laughed as they watched the relentless thrust of the police rapidly closing in on their prey. Meanwhile Nana had lost sight of Satin. Her legs had turned to jelly, and she would certainly have been caught if a man hadn’t grasped her by the arm and led her away under the nose of the furious police officers. It was Prullière, who had caught sight of her in the crowd. Without saying a word he took her into the Rue Rougemont, which was deserted and where she was able to get her breath back. She was almost fainting and he had to support her. She didn’t even thank him."

"Il voulut le reprendre. Mais Steiner refusait de quitter Bordenave. Devant eux, une queue s’écrasait au contrôle, un tapage de voix montait, dans lequel le nom de Nana sonnait avec la vivacité chantante de ses deux syllabes. Les hommes qui se plantaient devant les affiches, l’épelaient à voix haute ; d’autres le jetaient en passant, sur un ton d’interrogation ; tandis que les femmes, inquiètes et souriantes, le répétaient doucement, d’un air de surprise. Personne ne connaissait Nana. D’où Nana tombait-elle ? Et des histoires couraient, des plaisanteries chuchotées d’oreille à oreille. C'était une caresse que ce nom, un petit nom dont la familiarité allait à toutes les bouches. Rien qu’à le prononcer ainsi, la foule s’égayait et devenait bon enfant. Une fièvre de curiosité poussait le monde, cette curiosité de Paris qui a la violence d’un accès de folie chaude. On voulait voir Nana. Une dame eut le volant de sa robe arraché, un monsieur perdit son chapeau.","He wanted to take it back. But Steiner refused to leave Bordenave. In front of them, a queue crashed at the control, a din of voices rose, in which Nana's name rang out with the lilting liveliness of its two syllables. The men standing in front of the posters spelled it out loud; others threw it down in passing, in a questioning tone; while the women, worried and smiling, repeated it softly, with an air of surprise. No one knew Nana. Where did Nana fall from? And stories went around, jokes whispered from ear to ear. This name was a caress, a little name whose familiarity went on everyone's lips. Merely pronouncing it like this made the crowd laugh and become good-natured. A fever of curiosity drove the world, that curiosity of Paris which has the violence of a fit of hot madness. We wanted to see Nana. A lady had the flounce of her dress torn off, a gentleman lost his hat.","He tried to lead him away, but Steiner refused to leave Bordenave. The crowd at the box-office became more compact, the buzz of voices grew louder, and the name of Nana was repeated over and over again with a sing-song enunciation of its two syllables. The men, standing in front of the posters, read it out loud; others, as they passed, uttered it interrogatively, while the women, smiling and uneasy, repeated it softly with an air of surprise. No one knew Nana. Where on earth had Nana come from? And little jokes were passed about from ear to ear, and little tales told. The very name sounded like a caress, and fell familiarly from the lips of every one. Its constant repetition amused the crowd and kept it in a good humour. A fever of curiosity took possession of everybody—that Parisian curiosity which is sometimes as violent as an attack of brain fever. All were eager to see Nana. One lady had the train of her dress torn, and a gentleman lost his hat.","He wanted to take possession of him again. But Steiner would not quit Bordenave. In front of them a stream of people was crowding and crushing against the ticket office, and there was a din of voices, in the midst of which the name of Nana sounded with all the melodious vivacity of its two syllables. The men who stood planted in front of the notices kept spelling it out loudly; others, in an interrogative tone, uttered it as they passed; while the women, at once restless and smiling, repeated it softly with an air of surprise. Nobody knew Nana. Whence had Nana fallen? And stories and jokes, whispered from ear to ear, went the round of the crowd. The name was a caress in itself; it was a pet name, the very familiarity of which suited every lip. Merely through enunciating it thus, the throng worked itself into a state of gaiety and became highly good natured. A fever of curiosity urged it forward, that kind of Parisian curiosity which is as violent as an access of positive unreason. Everybody wanted to see Nana. A lady had the flounce of her dress torn off; a man lost his hat.","He tried to get him away. Steiner was reluctant to leave Bordenave. Behind them a queue of people were storming the box-office and the hubbub of voices was growing louder and louder, with the name ‘Nana’ providing a lively and melodious refrain. The men stationed in front of the billboard were spelling it out in full, while others mentioned it in passing, with a questioning note; the women, smiling uneasily, were whispering it quietly, with a look of surprise. Nobody knew Nana. Where on earth had she sprung from? People were telling each other stories. Jokes were being exchanged in whispers. The name sounded endearing, it had a nice familiar ring, everybody liked pronouncing it; merely saying it made the crowd cheerful and sympathetically inclined. Paris society was being gripped by a typically feverish curiosity, a sudden, stupid craze. People couldn’t wait to see Nana. One lady had the flounce of her dress ripped off, a gentleman lost his hat."

"La Mignotte se trouvait à plus de trois lieues. Nana perdit une heure pour louer une voiture, une immense calèche délabrée qui roulait lentement avec un bruit de ferraille. Elle s’était tout de suite emparée du cocher, un petit vieux taciturne qu’elle accablait de questions. Est-ce qu’il avait souvent passé devant la Mignotte ? Alors, c’était derrière ce coteau ? Ça devait être plein d’arbres, n’est-ce pas ? Et la maison, se voyait-elle de loin ? Le petit vieux répondait par des grognements. Dans la calèche, Nana dansait d’impatience ; tandis que Zoé, fâchée d’avoir quitté Paris si vite, se tenait raide et maussade. Le cheval s’étant arrêté court, la jeune femme crut qu’on arrivait. Elle passa la tête par la portière, elle demanda :","La Mignotte was more than three leagues away. Nana lost an hour to rent a car, a huge, dilapidated carriage that rolled slowly with the sound of iron.

It must have been full of trees, right? And the house, could it be seen from afar? The little old man replied with grunts. In the carriage, Nana danced with impatience; while Zoe, angry at having left Paris so soon, stood stiff and sullen. The horse having stopped short, the young woman thought they were coming. She stuck her head out the door, she asked:","La Mignotte was distant more than three leagues from Orleans. Nana lost an hour in securing a vehicle to take her there—an immense dilapidated open carriage, which rolled slowly along with a great jingling of old iron. She at once attacked the driver, a little taciturn old man, whom she belaboured with questions. Had he often passed by La Mignotte? So, it was behind that hill? There were probably plenty of trees there, were there not? And could the house be seen from a distance? The little old fellow only answered with grunts. Nana jumped about impatiently in the vehicle; whilst Zoé, annoyed at having had to leave Paris in such a hurry, remained stiff and sulky.

Down in the calash Nana was almost dancing with impatience, while Zoe, in her annoyance at having left Paris in such a hurry, sat stiffly sulking beside her.

"Mais la vérité était que ça ne lui disait plus rien. Elle trouvait Georges très gentil, elle aurait voulu l’avoir pour camarade, pas davantage. Cependant, quand il arrivait tous les jours à quatre heures, il semblait si malheureux, qu’elle cédait souvent encore, le gardait dans ses armoires, lui laissant continuellement ramasser les miettes de sa beauté. Il ne quittait plus l’hôtel, familier comme le petit chien Bijou, l’un et l’autre dans les jupes de leur maîtresse, ayant un peu d’elle, même lorsqu’elle était avec un autre, attrapant des aubaines de sucre et de caresses, aux heures d’ennui solitaire.","But the truth was that it meant nothing to him anymore. She found Georges very nice, she would have liked to have him as a friend, no more. However, when he arrived every day at four o'clock, he seemed so unhappy that she still often yielded, kept him in her cupboards, leaving him continually to pick up the crumbs of her beauty. He never left the hotel, familiar as the little dog Bijou, both in the skirts of their mistress, having a bit of her, even when she was with another, catching sugar bargains and caresses, in hours of solitary boredom.","But the truth was she no longer felt as she did in regard to him. She thought George very nice, she would have liked to have had him for a companion, but nothing more. However, when he came every day at four o’clock, he seemed so sad, that she often again yielded, permitted him to hide in her cupboards, and continually to pick up the crumbs of her beauty. In time, he scarcely ever left the house, where he was as much at home as the little dog Bijou, both of them among the mistress’s skirts, having a little of her, even when she was with another, and catching windfalls of sugar and caresses, in the hours of weary solitude.","But the truth was that this remark now meant nothing. She thought Georges very nice and would have liked him as a companion, but as nothing else. Nevertheless, when he arrived daily at four o'clock he seemed so wretched that she was often fain to be as compliant as of old and would hide him in cupboards and constantly allow him to pick up the crumbs from Beauty's table. He hardly ever left the house now and became as much one of its inmates as the little dog Bijou. Together they nestled among Mistress's skirts and enjoyed a little of her at a time, even when she was with another man, while doles of sugar and stray caresses not seldom fell to their share in her hours of loneliness and boredom.","But the truth was that she no longer felt attracted. Georges was certainly a very nice boy, and she would have liked to have him just as a good friend and nothing more. However, when he turned up every day at four o’clock looking thoroughly miserable, she often weakened, hiding him in wardrobes and cupboards and continually letting him enjoy a few spare crumbs of her beauty. He became a sort of permanent fixture in the house, rather like the little dog Bijou, both of them being allowed to sniff round their mistress’s skirts, getting a little bit of her when she was with someone else and picking up little windfalls like lumps of sugar or being fondled when she was bored and lonely."

"Il baissa la tête. Au fond, il restait heureux des serments de la jeune femme. Elle, voyant sa puissance, commença à ne plus le ménager. Et, dès lors, Satin fut installée dans la maison, ouvertement, sur le même pied que ces messieurs. Vandeuvres n’avait pas eu besoin de lettres anonymes pour comprendre ; il plaisantait, il cherchait des querelles de jalousie à Satin ; tandis que Philippe et Georges la traitaient en camarade, avec des poignées de main et des plaisanteries très raides.","He lowered his head. Basically, he remained happy with the young woman's oaths. She, seeing his power, began to no longer spare him.

He joked about it, and had little quarrels of jealousy with Satin; whilst Philippe and George treated her as a comrade, shaking hands with her and saying some very equivocal things.","He hung his head, for the young woman's vows of fidelity made him happy at bottom. She, however, now knew her power over him and ceased to consider his feelings. And from that time forth Satin was openly installed in the house on the same footing as the gentlemen.

Philippe and Georges, on their parts, treated her like a jolly good fellow, shaking hands with her and cracking the riskiest jokes imaginable.","He lowered his eyes. At heart, he was delighted to hear her protesting her innocence, while she realized the power she had over him and began to stop humouring him.

"Et il entra dans la salle, une pièce étroite, basse de plafond, encombrée d’une grande balance. C'était comme une salle des bagages, dans une station de banlieue. Nana eut encore là une grosse déception, elle qui se figurait quelque chose de très vaste, une machine monumentale pour peser 47 les chevaux. Comment ! on ne pesait que les jockeys ! Alors, ça ne valait pas la peine de faire tant d’embarras, avec leur pesage ! Dans la balance, un jockey, l’air idiot, ses harnais sur les genoux, attendait qu’un gros homme en redingote eût vérifié son poids ; tandis qu’un garçon d’écurie, à la porte, tenait le cheval, Cosinus, autour duquel la foule s’attroupait, silencieuse, absorbée.","And he entered the hall, a narrow room with a low ceiling, cluttered with a large scale. It was like a baggage hall, in a suburban station. Nana had another big disappointment here, she who imagined something very vast, a monumental machine for weighing horses. How ! we only weighed the jockeys! So it was not worth bothering with their weighing! In the balance, a jockey, looking foolish, his harness on his knees, waited until a fat man in a frock coat had checked his weight; while a stable boy at the door held the horse, Cosinus, around whom the crowd gathered, silent, absorbed.","And he went inside. It was a narrow apartment, with a low ceiling, and almost filled with a big weighing machine. It was like the room where luggage is weighed at a small suburban station. Nana was again greatly disappointed. She had figured to herself a very vast affair—a monumental apparatus for weighing the horses. What! they only weighed the jockeys! Then there was no need to make such a fuss about it. Seated in the scales, a jockey, looking an awful fool, with his saddle and harness on his knees, was waiting till a stout man in an overcoat had taken his weight; whilst a stable lad, at the door, held the horse, Cosinus, around which the crowd gathered, silent and wrapped in thought.","And he entered the room, which was narrow and low-pitched and half filled with a great pair of scales. It was like a waiting room in a suburban station, and Nana was again hugely disillusioned, for she had been picturing to herself something on a very vast scale, a monumental machine, in fact, for weighing horses. Dear me, they only weighed the jockeys! Then it wasn't worth while making such a fuss with their weighing! In the scale a jockey with an idiotic expression was waiting, harness on knee, till a stout man in a frock coat should have done verifying his weight. At the door a stable help was holding a horse, Cosinus, round which a silent and deeply interested throng was clustering.","And he went off into the room, which was narrow and lowceilinged with a massive weighing-machine in the middle. It looked like the left-luggage room in a suburban station. Once again Nana was sadly disappointed; she’d pictured something enormous, a colossal machine to weigh the horses. So they only weighed the jockeys! In that case there wasn’t much point in making such a fuss about their silly old weigh-in enclosure! On the scales an idiotic-looking man with a saddle and harness on his lap was waiting for a burly fellow in a frockcoat to check his weight, while in the doorway a stablelad was holding the horse Cosine and a silent throng of people was gathered, watching intently."

Mummy was a laundress, Daddy was a drunk and he died from it. That’s the long and the short of it, so if you’re ashamed of my family . . .’"
"Sur le trottoir, sa première pensée fut d’aller coucher avec Satin, si celle-ci n’avait personne. Elle la rencontra devant sa maison, jetée elle aussi sur le pavé par son propriétaire, qui venait de faire poser un cadenas à sa porte, contre tout droit, puisqu’elle était dans ses meubles ; elle jurait, elle parlait de le traîner chez le commissaire. En attendant, comme minuit sonnait, il fallait songer à trouver un lit. Et Satin, jugeant prudent de ne pas mettre les sergents de ville dans ses affaires, finit par emmener Nana rue de Laval, chez une dame qui tenait un petit hôtel meublé. On leur donna, au premier étage, une étroite chambre, dont la fenêtre ouvrait sur la cour. Satin répétait :","On the sidewalk, her first thought was to go and sleep with Satin, if she had no one. She met her in front of her house, also thrown on the pavement by her landlord, who had just had a padlock placed on her door, against all rights, since she was in her furniture; she was swearing, she was talking about dragging him to the superintendent. In the meantime, as midnight struck, they had to think about finding a bed. And Satin, judging it prudent not to put the sergents de ville in her business, ended up taking Nana to rue de Laval, to the house of a lady who kept a small furnished hotel. They were given a narrow room on the first floor, the window of which opened onto the courtyard. Satin repeated:","Outside, her first idea was to go and sleep with Satin, if no one else was with her. She met her outside her house, she having been also chucked out, but by her landlord, who had put a padlock on her door, against all legal right, as the furniture was hers. Satin cursed and swore, and talked of having him up before the commissary of police. However, as midnight was striking, the first thing to do was to obtain a bed somewhere. And Satin, thinking it best not to make the policeman acquainted with the state of her affairs, ended by taking Nana to a lady who kept a licensed lodging-house in the Rue de Laval. They obtained a small back room on the first floor overlooking the courtyard. “I might have gone to Madame Robert’s,” said Satin.","When she was out in the street her first thought was to go and sleep with Satin, provided the girl had no one with her. She met her in front of her house, for she, too, had been turned out of doors by her landlord. He had just had a padlock affixed to her door--quite illegally, of course, seeing that she had her own furniture. She swore and talked of having him up before the commissary of police. In the meantime, as midnight was striking, they had to begin thinking of finding a bed. And Satin, deeming it unwise to let the plain-clothes men into her secrets, ended by taking Nana to a woman who kept a little hotel in the Rue de Laval. Here they were assigned a narrow room on the first floor, the window of which opened on the courtyard. Satin remarked:","Outside on the pavement, her first thought was to seek refuge for the night with Satin, unless she had someone with her. But she met her in front of her house; she’d also just been turned out by her landlord who’d put a padlock on her door, a thing he’d absolutely no right to do, it was her furniture. She was cursing and swearing and threatening to put the police on to him. In the meantime, as it was striking twelve, they had to do something about finding a bed for the night. In the end, thinking it wiser not to involve the police in her affairs, Satin took Nana round to a little lodging-house run by a lady she knew in the Rue de Laval. She gave them a tiny room on the first floor overlooking the courtyard. ‘I’d have gone to Madame Robert’, Satin was saying, ‘she’s always able to squeeze me in somewhere."
"Vers une heure du matin, dans le grand lit drapé de point de Venise1, Nana et le comte ne dormaient pas encore. Il était revenu le soir, après une bouderie de trois jours. La chambre, faiblement éclairée par une lampe, sommeillait, chaude et toute moite d’une odeur d’amour, avec les pâleurs vagues de ses meubles de laque blanche, incrustée d’argent. Un rideau rabattu noyait le lit d’un flot d’ombre. Il y eut un soupir, puis un baiser coupa le silence, et Nana, glissant des couvertures, resta un instant assise au bord des draps, les jambes nues. Le comte, la tête retombée sur l’oreiller, demeurait dans le noir.","Around one o'clock in the morning, in the big bed draped in Venetian stitch,1 Nana and the Count were not yet asleep. He had returned in the evening, after sulking for three days. The room, dimly lighted by a lamp, slumbered, warm and moist with the odor of love, with the vague pallor of its white lacquer furniture incrusted with silver. A drawn curtain drowned the bed in a wave of shadow. There was a sigh, then a kiss broke the silence, and Nana, slipping off the covers, sat for a moment on the edge of the sheets, her legs bare. The count, his head falling back on the pillow, remained in the dark.","It was nearly one o’clock in the morning, and Nana and the count, in the big bed hung with Venetian lace, were not yet asleep. He had returned that evening, after sulking for three days. The room, which was only feebly lighted by a lamp, was wrapped in silence, and felt warm and moist with an odor of love; whilst the white lacquer furniture, inlaid with silver, was only vaguely visible. A drawn curtain half hid the bed in a flood of shadow. There was a sigh, and then the sound of a kiss broke the silence; and Nana, gliding from under the clothes, remained seated for an instance on the edge of the bed, with her legs bare. The count, his head fallen back on the pillow, continued in the shadow.","Toward one in the morning, in the great bed of the Venice point draperies, Nana and the count lay still awake. He had returned to her that evening after a three days sulking fit. The room, which was dimly illumined by a lamp, seemed to slumber amid a warm, damp odor of love, while the furniture, with its white lacquer and silver incrustations, loomed vague and wan through the gloom. A curtain had been drawn to, so that the bed lay flooded with shadow. A sigh became audible; then a kiss broke the silence, and Nana, slipping off the coverlet, sat for a moment or two, barelegged, on the edge of the bed. The count let his head fall back on the pillow and remained in darkness.","In the large bed draped in Venetian lace, Nana and the count were not yet asleep. After sulking for three days, he’d come back that evening. In the light of a single lamp the vague outlines of the silver-encrusted lacquer furniture cast a pale gleam; the bedroom was drowsy with the warm, stuffy smell of love. A curtain had slipped down, casting a shadowy veil over the bed. There was a sigh and the silence was broken by the sound of a kiss; then, sliding out from under the blankets, Nana sat for a moment, bare-legged, on the sheets at the edge of the bed. The count’s head had fallen back on the sheets and lay in shadow."

"Fauchery fit un signe qu’on les écoutait, il fallait être convenable. De nouveau, la porte venait de s’ouvrir, et une vieille dame entrait, suivie d’un jeune homme, dans lequel le journaliste reconnut l’échappé de collège26, qui, le soir de La Blonde Vénus, avait lancé le fameux « très chic ! » dont on causait encore. L’arrivée de cette dame remuait le salon. Vivement, la comtesse Sabine s’était levée, pour s’avancer à sa rencontre ; et elle lui avait pris les deux mains, elle la nommait sa « chère madame Hugon ». Voyant son cousin regarder curieusement cette scène, la Faloise, afin de le toucher, le mit au courant, en quelques mots brefs : madame Hugon, veuve d’un notaire retirée aux Fondettes, une ancienne propriété de sa famille, près d’Orléans, conservait un pied-à-terre à Paris, dans une maison qu’elle possédait, rue de Richelieu ; y passait en ce moment quelques semaines pour installer son plus jeune fils, qui faisait sa première année de droit ; était autrefois une grande amie de la marquise de Chouard et avait vu naître la comtesse, qu’elle gardait des mois entiers chez elle, avant son mariage, et qu’elle tutoyait même encore.","Fauchery made a sign that they were being listened to, they had to be polite. Again, the door had just opened, and an old lady entered, followed by a young man, in whom the journalist recognized the school dropout26, who, on the evening of La Blonde Vénus, had launched the famous ""very classy! which we were still talking about. The arrival of this lady shook the drawing-room. Hurriedly, the Countess Sabine had risen to come forward to meet him; and she had taken both his hands, calling her ""dear Madame Hugon."" Seeing her cousin watching this scene curiously, La Faloise, in order to touch him, informed him, in a few brief words: Madame Hugon, widow of a notary retired to Fondettes, a former property of her family, near Orléans, kept a pied-à-terre in Paris, in a house she owned, rue de Richelieu; was currently spending a few weeks there to settle her youngest son, who was in his first year of law school; was once a great friend of the Marquise de Chouard and had seen the birth of the Countess, whom she kept for whole months at home, before her marriage, and whom she even still used to use as familiar terms.","Fauchery signalled to him that some one was listening; they must observe the proprieties. Again the door had opened, and an old lady entered, followed by a youth, whom the journalist recognised as the youngster fresh from college, who, on the first night of the “Blonde Venus,” had uttered the famous “Isn’t she stunning!” which was still talked about. The lady’s arrival caused quite a commotion in the drawing-room. Countess Sabine hastily rose from her chair to meet her. She took hold of her hands, and called her her dear Madame Hugon. Seeing his cousin watch this scene rather curiously, La Faloise, with the view of impressing him, explained it in a few words. Madame Hugon was a notary’s widow, and had retired to a place called Les Fondettes, an estate which had long belonged to her family, and which was situated near Orleans. She had kept up a small establishment in Paris, in a house belonging to her in the Rue de Richelieu, and was now passing a few weeks there for the purpose of arranging everything for her younger son, who was studying for the bar. She had been the Marchioness de Chouard’s great friend, and had been present at the countess’s birth. The latter had often spent months with her, up to the time of her marriage with the count, and they were still very intimate together.","Fauchery motioned to him that they were overheard and must respect the conventions here. The door had just been opened anew, and an old lady had come in, followed by a young man in whom the journalist recognized the truant schoolboy, perpetrator of the famous and as yet unforgotten ""tres chic"" of the Blonde Venus first night. This lady's arrival caused a stir among the company. The Countess Sabine had risen briskly from her seat in order to go and greet her, and she had taken both her hands in hers and addressed her as her ""dear Madame Hugon. "" Seeing that his cousin viewed this little episode with some curiosity, La Faloise sought to arouse his interest and in a few brief phrases explained the position. Mme Hugon, widow of a notary, lived in retirement at Les Fondettes, an old estate of her family's in the neighborhood of Orleans, but she also kept up a small establishment in Paris in a house belonging to her in the Rue de Richelieu and was now passing some weeks there in order to settle her youngest son, who was reading the law and in his ""first year. "" In old times she had been a dear friend of the Marquise de Chouard and had assisted at the birth of the countess, who, prior to her marriage, used to stay at her house for months at a time and even now was quite familiarly treated by her.","Fauchery made a sign that there were people within earshot and they mustn’t forget their manners. The door had just opened again and an old lady was coming in, followed by a young man whom the journalist recognized as the truant schoolboy who, at the first night of The Blonde Venus, had uttered that famous shout of ‘Fantastic!’ which people were still talking about. The lady’s arrival caused a stir. The countess had quickly gone over to greet her, grasping both her hands and calling her: ‘dear Madame Hugon!’ Seeing that his cousin’s curiosity was aroused, la Faloise, hoping to make him more forthcoming, briefly put him into the picture: Madame Hugon was the widow of a solicitor and had retired to Les Fondettes, an old country estate, while keeping a pied-à-terre in Paris in a house she owned in Rue Richelieu; she was spending a few weeks there at the moment to set up her younger son during his first year as a law student; she had been a great friend of the old Marquise de Chouard, and after the birth of the countess used to have the girl to stay with her for months at a time until her marriage; and she’d remained on very close terms with her."

"Il resta près de la comtesse. Tout en causant avec elle, il continuait ses réflexions. Elle ne paraissait pas son âge ; on lui aurait donné au plus vingt-huit ans ; ses yeux surtout gardaient une flamme de jeunesse, que de longues paupières noyaient d’une ombre bleue. Grandie dans un ménage désuni, passant un mois près du marquis de Chouard et un mois près de la marquise, elle s’était mariée très jeune, à la mort de sa mère, poussée sans doute par son père, qu’elle gênait. Un terrible homme, le marquis, et sur lequel d’étranges histoires commençaient à courir, malgré sa haute piété ! Fauchery demanda s’il n’aurait pas l’honneur de le saluer. Certainement, son père viendrait, mais très tard ; il avait tant de travail ! Le journaliste, qui croyait savoir où le vieux passait ses soirées, resta grave. Mais un signe qu’il aperçut à la joue gauche de la comtesse, près de la bouche, le surprit. Nana avait le même, absolument. C'était drôle. Sur le signe, de petits poils 21 frisaient ; seulement, les poils blonds de Nana étaient chez l’autre d’un noir de jais. N’importe, cette femme ne couchait avec personne.","He remained close to the countess. While chatting with her, he continued his reflections. She didn't look her age; he would have been thought to be twenty-eight at the most; his eyes especially retained a flame of youth, which long eyelids drowned in a blue shadow. Grown up in a disunited household, spending a month with the Marquis de Chouard and a month with the Marquise, she had married very young, on the death of her mother, probably pushed by her father, whom she embarrassed. A terrible man, the marquis, and about whom strange stories began to run, in spite of his high piety! Fauchery asked if he would not have the honor to salute him. Certainly, his father would come, but very late; he had so much work! The journalist, who thought he knew where the old man spent his evenings, remained serious. But a sign which he saw on the countess's left cheek, near the mouth, surprised him. Nana had the same, absolutely. It was funny. On the sign, little hairs curled; only Nana's blond hair was jet black on the other. No matter, this woman slept with no one.","He remained next to the countess, and whilst talking with her he continued his reflections. She did not look her age; one would have thought her twenty-eight years old at most; her eyes, which her long lashes shaded with a blue shadow, especially retained a sparkle of youth. Brought up by parents living apart, spending one month with the Marquis de Chouard and the next with the Marchioness, she married when very young, shortly after her mother’s death, incited thereto, no doubt, by her father, in whose way she was. He was a terrible man, the marquis, and strange stories were beginning to circulate about him, in spite of his great show of piety! Fauchery asked if he would have the honour of seeing him. Certainly, her father would come, though very late; he had so much work to attend to! The journalist, who thought he knew where the old man spent his evenings, preserved his gravity; but a mark he noticed on the countess’s left cheek near her mouth, surprised him greatly. Nana had the same—exactly. It was funny. On the mark were some little curly hairs, only the hairs on Nana were light, whilst those on the other were as black as jet. But, no matter, this woman hadn’t a lover.","He remained beside the countess and, while talking with her, continued his meditations. She did not look her age; one would have set her down as being twenty-eight at most, for her eyes, above all, which were filled with the dark blue shadow of her long eyelashes, retained the glowing light of youth. Bred in a divided family, so that she used to spend one month with the Marquis de Chouard, another with the marquise, she had been married very young, urged on, doubtless, by her father, whom she embarrassed after her mother's death. A terrible man was the marquis, a man about whom strange tales were beginning to be told, and that despite his lofty piety! Fauchery asked if he should have the honor of meeting him. Certainly her father was coming, but only very late; he had so much work on hand! The journalist thought he knew where the old gentleman passed his evenings and looked grave. But a mole, which he noticed close to her mouth on the countess's left cheek, surprised him. Nana had precisely the same mole. It was curious. Tiny hairs curled up on it, only they were golden in Nana's case, black as jet in this. Ah well, never mind! This woman enjoyed nobody's embraces.","He stayed with the countess, still pursuing his train of thought while continuing to chat with her. She seemed younger than her age; he wouldn’t have taken her for more than 28; her eyes in particular had kept a youthful glow, shadowed by the blue of her long eyelids. Having grown up in a broken home, spending alternate months with the Marquis de Chouard and the marchioness, she had married very young, when her mother died, no doubt egged on by her father, who found her presence embarrassing; the marquis, although extremely pious, was a dreadful man, about whom strange stories were beginning to circulate. Fauchery asked if he would be having the honour of meeting him. Yes, her father would certainly be coming but not until much later. The journalist thought he had a good idea where the old man spent his evenings, but he kept a straight face. He was struck by the mole on the countess’s left cheek, close to her mouth; Nana had an absolutely identical one. That was funny. Curly little hairs were sprouting out of the mole, but while Nana’s were blonde hers were jet-black. Never mind, this woman wasn’t going to bed with anyone …"

"Le décor du second acte fut une surprise. On était dans un bastringue 73 de barrière74, à La Boule Noire, en plein mardi gras ; des chienlits 75 chantaient une ronde, qu’ils accompagnaient au refrain en tapant des talons. Cette échappée canaille, à laquelle on ne s’attendait point, égaya tellement, qu’on bissa la ronde. Et c’était là que la bande des dieux, égarée par Iris, qui se vantait faussement de connaître la Terre, venait procéder à son enquête. Ils s’étaient déguisés, pour garder l’incognito. Jupiter entra en roi Dagobert76, avec sa culotte à l’envers et une vaste couronne de fer-blanc. Phébus parut en Postillon 77 de Longjumeau et Minerve en Nourrice normande. De grands éclats de gaieté accueillirent Mars, qui portait un costume extravagant d’Amiral suisse78. Mais les rires devinrent scandaleux, lorsqu’on vit Neptune vêtu d’une blouse, coiffé d’une haute casquette ballonnée, des accroche-cœurs collés aux tempes, traînant ses pantoufles et disant d’une voix grasse : « De quoi ! quand on est bel homme, faut bien se laisser aimer ! » Il y eut quelques oh ! oh ! tandis que les dames haussaient un peu leurs éventails. Lucy, dans son avant-scène, riait si bruyamment que Caroline Héquet la fit taire d’un léger coup d’éventail.","The decor of the second act was a surprise. We were in a bastringue 73 de Barrière74, at La Boule Noire, in the middle of Shrove Tuesday; 75 shrines were singing a round, which they accompanied to the chorus by tapping their heels. This scoundrel breakaway, which we did not expect, cheered up so much that we sang the rounds again. And it was there that the band of gods, led astray by Iris, who falsely boasted of knowing the Earth, came to proceed with their investigation. They had disguised themselves, to remain incognito. Jupiter entered as King Dagobert76, with his breeches inside out and a vast tin crown. Phébus appeared as Postillion 77 of Longjumeau and Minerva as Norman Nurse. Great cheers greeted Mars, who wore an extravagant costume of a Swiss Admiral. But the laughter became outrageous when Neptune was seen dressed in a blouse, wearing a high puffy cap, heart-catchers glued to his temples, dragging his slippers and saying in a greasy voice: “What! when you're a handsome man, you have to let yourself be loved! There were a few ohs! Oh ! while the ladies raised their fans a little. Lucy, in her proscenium, was laughing so loudly that Caroline Héquet silenced her with a flick of her fan.","The scenery of the second act was a surprise. It represented a low dancing establishment of the suburbs, called the “Boule Noire,” on a Shrove Tuesday. Some masqueraders, dressed in grotesque costumes, sang a lively strain, the chorus of which they accompanied by stamping their heels. The words and gestures being not over decorous and quite unexpected, amused the audience immensely, and secured the honours of an encore. And it was into this place that the troop of gods, led astray by Iris, who falsely claimed to know the earth, had come to pursue their investigations. They were disguised so as to preserve their incognito. Jupiter appeared as King Dagobert,i with his breeches turned wrong side out, and a huge tin crown on his head. Phoebus masqueraded as the Postillion of Longjumeau,j and Minerva as a Norman wet nurse. Shouts of laughter greeted Mars, who wore a preposterous costume, as a Swiss admiral; but the mirth became scandalous when Neptune, dressed in a blouse and tall cap, with little curls glued to his temples, dragged after him his slip-shod shoes, and said, in an unctuous tone of voice: “Well! what next? When a fellow’s handsome, he must allow himself to be adored!” This elicited a few “Oh! ohs! ” while the ladies slightly raised their fans. Lucy, in her stage-box, laughed so noisily that Caroline Héquet entreated her to be quiet.","The scenery of the second act came as a surprise. It represented a suburban Shrove Tuesday dance at the Boule Noire. Masqueraders were trolling a catch, the chorus of which was accompanied with a tapping of their heels. This 'Arryish departure, which nobody had in the least expected, caused so much amusement that the house encored the catch. And it was to this entertainment that the divine band, let astray by Iris, who falsely bragged that he knew the Earth well , were now come in order to proceed with their inquiry. They had put on disguises so as to preserve their incognito. Jupiter came on the stage as King Dagobert, with his breeches inside out and a huge tin crown on his head. Phoebus appeared as the Postillion of Lonjumeau and Minerva as a Norman nursemaid. Loud bursts of merriment greeted Mars, who wore an outrageous uniform, suggestive of an Alpine admiral. But the shouts of laughter became uproarious when Neptune came in view, clad in a blouse, a high, bulging workman's cap on his head, lovelocks glued to his temples. Shuffling along in slippers, he cried in a thick brogue. ""Well, I'm blessed! When ye're a masher it'll never do not to let 'em love yer!"" There were some shouts of ""Oh! Oh!"" while the ladies held their fans one degree higher. Lucy in her stage box laughed so obstreperously that Caroline Hequet silenced her with a tap of her fan.","The set for the second act was a surprise: it was Shrove Tuesday in The Black Ball, a low dance-hall in the seedy outskirts of Paris. Masked revellers were singing a sort of roundelay and tap-dancing to the refrain. The audience found this unexpected glimpse of low life amusing, and demanded an encore of the song. This was the place where the gods, misled by Iris, who’d boasted quite falsely that she knew the Earth, had come to conduct their investigation. To keep their incognito, they’d disguised themselves. Jupiter appeared as King Dagobert,* with his breeches on back-to-front and wearing a huge tin crown. Phoebus was the Postilion of Longjumeau,* and Minerva a wet-nurse from Normandy. Wearing an outlandish Swiss admiral’s uniform, Mars was greeted by hoots of laughter which took on a very offensive tone when Neptune shuffled in, dressed in a workman’s smock and matching tall puffed cap and slippers, with his temples plastered with kiss-curls, and smirking in an oily voice: ‘What are you on about? When you’re a good-looking man, it’s wrong not to let ‘em love you!’ There were a few shocked exclamations and the ladies tried to hide their faces behind their fans. In her stage box Lucy was laughing so loudly that Caroline Héquet had to give her a tap with her fan to restrain her."

"Alors, il pensa à Dieu. Cette idée brusque d’un secours divin, d’une consolation surhumaine, le surprit, comme une chose inattendue et singulière ; elle éveillait en lui l’image de M. Venot, il voyait sa petite figure grasse, ses dents gâtées. Certainement, M. Venot, qu’il désolait depuis des mois, en évitant de le voir, serait bien heureux, s’il allait frapper à sa porte, pour pleurer entre ses bras. Autrefois, Dieu lui gardait toutes ses miséricordes. Au moindre chagrin, au moindre obstacle barrant sa vie, il entrait dans une église, s’agenouillait, humiliait son néant devant la souveraine puissance ; et il en sortait fortifié par la prière, prêt aux abandons des biens de ce monde, avec l’unique désir de l’éternité de son salut. Mais, aujourd’hui, il ne pratiquait 36 plus que par secousses, aux heures où la terreur de l’enfer 37 le reprenait ; toutes sortes de mollesses l’avaient envahi, Nana troublait ses devoirs. Et l’idée de Dieu l’étonnait. Pourquoi n’avait-il pas songé à Dieu tout de suite, dans cette effroyable crise, où craquait et s’effondrait sa faible humanité ?","So he thought of God. This sudden idea of divine help, of superhuman consolation, surprised him as something unexpected and singular; she awakened in him the image of M. Venot, he saw her plump little face, her rotten teeth. Certainly, M. Venot, whom he had been distressing for months, by avoiding seeing him, would be very happy if he were to knock at his door, to weep in his arms. Formerly, God kept all his mercies for him. At the slightest grief, at the slightest obstacle blocking his life, he entered a church, knelt down, humiliated his nothingness before the sovereign power; and he came out strengthened by prayer, ready to abandon the goods of this world, with the sole desire of the eternity of his salvation. But, today, he practiced 36 only by jolts, at times when the terror of hell 37 overcame him; all sorts of softness had invaded him, Nana was disturbing her homework. And the idea of God amazed him. Why hadn't he thought of God right away, in that terrible crisis in which his feeble humanity was cracking and collapsing?","Then his thoughts turned to God. The sudden idea of divine assistance, of a superhuman consolation, surprised him, like something extraordinary and unexpected. It awakened in his mind the picture of M. Venot. He beheld his plump little person, his decayed teeth. For certain, M. Venot, whom for months past he had been grieving by not going near him, would be very happy were he now to knock at his door, and weep on his breast. At other times God had always been merciful to him. At the least sorrow, or the smallest obstacle encountered in life, he would enter a church, and, kneeling, would humble himself before the Supreme Being, and he would come out fortified by prayer, ready to enjoy the sweets of life, with the sole desire for the salvation of his soul; but now, he could only pray by fits and starts, just when a fear of hell seized upon him. He had given way to a great indolence. Nana interfered with his duties, and the thought of God surprised him. Why had he not thought of the Almighty in the first instance, during that frightful crisis in which his weak humanity succumbed?","Then he thought of God. The sudden idea of divine help, of superhuman consolation, surprised him, as though it were something unforeseen and extraordinary. The image of M. Venot was evoked thereby, and he saw his little plump face and ruined teeth. Assuredly M. Venot, whom for months he had been avoiding and thereby rendering miserable, would be delighted were he to go and knock at his door and fall weeping into his arms. In the old days God had been always so merciful toward him. At the least sorrow, the slightest obstacle on the path of life, he had been wont to enter a church, where, kneeling down, he would humble his littleness in the presence of Omnipotence. And he had been used to go forth thence, fortified by prayer, fully prepared to give up the good things of this world, possessed by the single yearning for eternal salvation. But at present he only practiced by fits and starts, when the terror of hell came upon him. All kinds of weak inclinations had overcome him, and the thought of Nana disturbed his devotions. And now the thought of God astonished him. Why had he not thought of God before, in the hour of that terrible agony when his feeble humanity was breaking up in ruin?","A thought came to him: there was God. This sudden idea of divine help, of comfort from above, took him by surprise, it was unexpected and strange, it brought to mind Monsieur Venot with his little fat face and rotten teeth. Certainly Monsieur Venot, to whom he’d been causing considerable distress for months by refusing to call on him, would be only too happy were he to knock on his door and fall crying into his arms. Previously God had never refused him His mercy; at the slightest affliction he would go into church, kneel down, and humble himself, a poor miserable sinner, before the power of Almighty God; and he came out strengthened by prayer, ready to give up all worldly things, concerned only with his eternal salvation. But nowadays he went to church only in fits and starts, whenever his fear of hell revived; his moral fibre had been undermined, Nana was coming between him and his religious duties. Now this thought of God surprised him: why hadn’t he thought of Him straight away when faced by this appalling crisis in which his human weakness was shaken and collapsing?"

"Un après-midi, comme elle rentrait d’un concert, Nana remarqua, sur un trottoir de la rue Montmartre, une femme qui trottait, les bottines éculées, les jupes sales, avec un chapeau détrempé par les pluies. Tout d’un coup, elle la reconnut.","One afternoon, as she was returning from a concert, Nana noticed, on a sidewalk in the rue Montmartre, a woman who was trotting along, her worn boots, her skirts dirty, with a hat soaked in the rain.

She has eyes like gimlet holes and tow-colored hair.","“Oh! is it possible to talk so?” cried Nana. “Her eyes are like gimlet holes, and her hair is the colour of tow.”","""Oh, just to think of it!"" cried Nana. "" She's got eyes like gimlet holes, and her hair's the color of tow.""","‘Well, what else can one say!’ Nana exclaimed. ‘ She’s got beady eyes and mousy hair.’"
"On piétinait, on se bousculait, serré entre les rangs des fauteuils, échangeant ses impressions. Un même mot courait :","We walked, we jostled, squeezed between the rows of armchairs, exchanging our impressions. The same word ran:","As the audience pushed their way through the rows of seats, they exchanged their impressions.

"Puis, elle aida Nana à se déshabiller, elle eut autour d’elle des airs de petite femme prévenante et soumise. Elle répétait avec câlinerie :","Then she helped Nana to undress, around her she looked like a considerate and submissive little woman. She repeated with coaxing:","Then she helped Nana to undress.

She kept saying coaxingly:","She helped Nana undress, fussing round her like a dutiful little wife and coaxing her to come to bed."
"Du coup, ces dames devinrent sérieuses. Quatre-vingt-dix ans ! Il n'y en avait pas une d’elles, comme le cria Lucy, fichue de vivre jusque-là. Toutes des patraques. D’ailleurs, Nana déclara qu’elle ne voulait pas faire de vieux os ; c’était plus drôle. On arrivait, la conversation fut coupée par les claquements de fouet des cochers, qui lançaient leurs bêtes. Pourtant, au milieu du bruit, Lucy continua, sautant à un autre sujet, pressant Nana de partir avec la bande, le lendemain. L'Exposition allait fermer, ces dames devaient rentrer à Paris ; où la saison dépassait leurs espérances. Mais Nana s’entêtait. Elle abominait Paris, elle n’y ficherait pas les pieds de sitôt.","Suddenly, these ladies became serious. Ninety years! There wasn't one of them, as Lucy shouted, damned to live that long. All of them. Besides, Nana declared that she did not want to make old bones; it was funnier. We arrived, the conversation was cut off by the cracking of the whips of the coachmen, who launched their beasts. Yet, amidst the noise, Lucy continued, jumping to another topic, urging Nana to leave with the gang the next day. The Exhibition was about to close, these ladies had to return to Paris; where the season exceeded their expectations. But Nana was stubborn. She abominated Paris, she would not set foot there anytime soon.","On hearing this, the ladies all became very serious. Ninety years old! There wasn’t one of them, as Lucy said, who had a chance of living to that age. They were all roarers. Nana, too, declared that she didn’t want to make old bones; it was funnier not to. They had now almost reached their destination, and their conversation was interrupted by the drivers cracking their whips as they urged on the tired horses. Yet, in the midst of the noise, Lucy, jumping to another subject, continued talking, and pressed Nana to leave with the others on the morrow. The Exhibition was about to close, and the ladies were anxious to get back to Paris, where the season so far had surpassed their wildest hopes. But Nana was obstinate. She detested Paris, she wouldn’t go back there for a long time to come.","At this the ladies became suddenly serious. Ninety years old! The deuce, there wasn't one of them, as Lucy loudly declared, who would live to that age. They were all done for. Besides, Nana said she didn't want to make old bones; it wouldn't be amusing. They were drawing near their destination, and the conversation was interrupted by the cracking of whips as the drivers put their horses to their best paces. Yet amid all the noise Lucy continued talking and, suddenly changing the subject, urged Nana to come to town with them all to-morrow. The exhibition was soon to close, and the ladies must really return to Paris, where the season was surpassing their expectations. But Nana was obstinate. She loathed Paris; she wouldn't set foot there yet!","The ladies looked suddenly earnest. Ninety! As Lucy exclaimed, there wasn’t one of them likely to live that long. Old crocks, that’s what they were, the lot of them! Nana said that she didn’t want to make old bones anyway , it was nicer to have fun. They were nearing their destination and their conversation was cut short by the crack of the drivers’ whips as they speeded up their horses. However, in the middle of all this noise Lucy changed the subject and started urging Nana to leave with the rest of the gang tomorrow. The World Fair would be closing down and the ladies had to go back to Paris, where the season was fulfilling their wildest expectations. Nana wasn’t keen; Paris was loathsome , it’d be a long time before she set foot there again …"

The formula introducing the character is taken from p. 64.,"On the road from Orleans to Paris it appeared like a flood of verdure, a bouquet of trees, breaking the monotony of that flat country, where cultivated fields could be seen as far as the horizon.","The house, which had been built at the end of the eighteenth century, stood in the middle of a huge square enclosure.","The late-seventeenth-century house, a simple, austere building, stood in the middle of a vast, square close; but the garden offered superb shade, a series of ponds and artificial waterways supplied by springs, a profusion of greenery, a mass of trees along the Paris-Orléans road breaking the monotony of the flat countryside of arable land which stretched out beyond the horizon."
"Daguenet et Fauchery, qui passaient, la saluèrent. Elle leur fit un signe, ils durent s’approcher. Et elle bêcha l’enceinte du pesage. Puis, s’interrompant :","Daguenet and Fauchery, who were passing, saluted her. She gave them a sign, they had to approach. And she dug up the weighing chamber.

Then interrupting herself, she exclaimed,","Daguenet and Fauchery passed by and bowed to her. She made them a sign, and they had to come up. Thereupon she made hay of the weighing-in enclosure. But she broke off abruptly:","Daguenet and Fauchery went by, raising their hats. She beckoned to them to come over and have a word with her. She made rude remarks about the private enclosure. Then she broke off and said:"
"Et, comme ce nom semblait ahurir son cousin, il ajouta :","And, as this name seemed to bewilder his cousin, he added:","“That’s Gaga,” replied Fauchery simply; and, as the name seemed to convey no information to his cousin, he added, “Haven’t you heard of Gaga?","""It's Gaga,"" was Fauchery's simple reply, and as this name seemed to astound his cousin, he added:","‘That’s Gaga’, Fauchery replied simply and as his cousin appeared perplexed by the name, he added:"
"Mais des rires vinrent de l’antichambre, des chuchotements, une bouffée de voix gaies et bavardes, comme si tout un couvent échappé se fût trouvé là. Et Labordette parut, traînant cinq femmes derrière lui, son pensionnat, selon le mot méchant de Lucy Stewart. Il y avait Gaga, majestueuse dans une robe de velours bleu qui la sanglait, Caroline Héquet, toujours en faille noire garnie de chantilly, puis Léa de Horn, fagotée comme à son habitude, la grosse Tatan Néné, une blonde bon enfant à poitrine de nourrice dont on se moquait, enfin la petite Maria Blond, une fillette de quinze ans, d’une maigreur et d’un vice de gamin, que lançait son début aux Folies8. Labordette avait amené tout ça dans une seule voiture ; et elles riaient encore d’avoir été serrées, Maria Blond sur les genoux des autres. Mais elles pincèrent les lèvres, échangeant des poignées de main et des saluts, toutes très comme il faut. Gaga faisait l’enfant, zézayait par excès de bonne tenue. Seule, Tatan Néné, à qui l’on avait raconté en chemin que six nègres9, absolument nus, serviraient le souper de Nana, s’inquiétait, demandant à les voir. Labordette la traita de dinde, en la priant de se taire.","But laughter came from the antechamber, whispers, a burst of gay, chattering voices, as if a whole escaped convent had been there. And Labordette appeared, dragging five women behind him, his boarding school, as Lucy Stewart put it wickedly. There was Gaga, majestic in a blue velvet dress that clung to her, Caroline Héquet, still in black faille garnished with whipped cream, then Léa de Horn, dressed up as usual, the fat Tatan Néné, a good-natured blonde with a chest of nanny who was made fun of, and lastly little Maria Blond, a little girl of fifteen, with the thinness and vice of a child, who had been launched by her debut at the Folies. Labordette had brought it all in one carriage; and they were still laughing at having been squeezed, Maria Blond on the others' knees. But they pursed their lips, exchanging handshakes and salutes, all very proper. Gaga was childish, lisping from excess of good manners. Only Tatan Néné, who had been told on the way that six negroes9, absolutely naked, would serve Nana's supper, was worried, asking to see them. Labordette called her a turkey, begging her to be quiet.","But sounds of laughter were heard coming from the anteroom, there were whisperings, and then quite a hubbub of gay voices all speaking at once, as though a whole convent full of girls had been let loose there. Suddenly Labordette appeared, dragging five women behind him—his school, as Lucy Stewart maliciously termed them. There was Gaga, looking very majestic in a blue velvet dress that was a great deal too tight for her, Caroline Héquet, always in black Flemish silk trimmed with Chantilly lace, then Léa de Horn, most slovenly dressed as usual, plump Tatan Néné, a jolly fair girl with the breast of a wet-nurse, whom every one made fun of, and finally little Maria Blond, a girl of fifteen, as thin and as wicked as a street-arab, and who was becoming quite the fashion ever since her first appearance at the Folies-Dramatiques Theatre. Labordette had brought them all in the same cab; and they were still laughing at the recollection of how they had been squeezed together, with Maria Blond on the others’ knees. But they composed themselves, shaking hands and bowing all round, like the most respectable people. Gaga acted quite childishly; and even stuttered in her attempts to behave well. Tatan Néné, however, who had been told coming along that six naked blacks would wait on them during Nana’s supper, became very uneasy at not seeing them. Labordette called her a goose, and told her to hold her tongue.","With that there came from the anteroom a sound of laughter and whispering and a burst of merry, chattering voices, which sounded as if a runaway convent were on the premises. And Labordette appeared, towing five women in his rear, his boarding school, as Lucy Stewart cruelly phrased it. There was Gaga, majestic in a blue velvet dress which was too tight for her, and Caroline Hequet, clad as usual in ribbed black silk, trimmed with Chantilly lace. Lea de Horn came next, terribly dressed up, as her wont was, and after her the big Tatan Nene, a good-humored fair girl with the bosom of a wet nurse, at which people laughed, and finally little Maria Blond, a young damsel of fifteen, as thin and vicious as a street child, yet on the high road to success, owing to her recent first appearance at the Folies. Labordette had brought the whole collection in a single fly, and they were stlll laughing at the way they had been squeezed with Maria Blond on her knees. But on entering the room they pursed up their lips, and all grew very conventional as they shook hands and exchanged salutations. Gaga even affected the infantile and lisped through excess of genteel deportment. Tatan Nene alone transgressed. They had been telling her as they came along that six absolutely naked Negroes would serve up Nana's supper, and she now grew anxious about them and asked to see them. Labordette called her a goose and besought her to be silent.","But gusts of laughter and whispering could be heard coming from the entrance hall, cheerful, chatty voices, as if a whole lot of convent girls had suddenly been let loose. And in came Labordette, trailing five women behind him, his boarding school, as Lucy Stewart maliciously described it. There was the majestic Gaga, squeezed into a blue velvet dress, Caroline Héquet, always in black ribbed silk trimmed with lace, Léa de Horn, dowdy as ever, then big, fat Tatan Néné, a cheerful blonde with udders like a cow whom everyone made fun of, and finally tiny Maria Blond, a little girl of 15, as skinny and vicious as a street urchin, who was just being launched on her career at the Folies Dramatiques. Labordette had brought the whole bunch of them along in one cab and they were still giggling at being packed so tightly, with Maria having to sit on the others’ laps. But, pursing their lips, they now made their way round shaking hands and greeting the others very primly. Gaga was being childish and lisping, in an exaggerated effort to be well-behaved. Only Tatan Néné seemed uneasy: on the way here they’d been telling her that Nana had engaged six buck niggers to wait at table stark naked and Tatan was asking to see them. Labordette called her a silly clot and told her to shut up."

Parc Monceau, created during the Second Empire, was, and still is, one of the most pleasant places to live in Paris. This is where Renée Saccard already lived in La Curée. Nana's private mansion undoubtedly resembles that of a famous demi-mondaine of the time, Valtesse de la Bigne.

"Ce fut une exclamation générale. Personne n’ouvrit la bouche de cette pièce des Variétés, à laquelle la bonne madame Hugon n’avait rien compris ; ces dames la connaissaient, mais elles n’en parlaient pas. Tout de suite, on se jeta dans le sentiment, dans une admiration raffinée et extatique des maîtres. Madame Du Joncquoy n’aimait que Weber37, madame Chantereau tenait pour les Italiens38. Les voix de ces dames s’étaient faites molles et languissantes. On eût dit, devant la cheminée, un recueillement d’église, le cantique discret et pâmé d’une petite chapelle.","It was a general exclamation. Nobody opened the mouth of this play of the Variétés, of which the good Madame Hugon had understood nothing; these ladies knew her, but they did not speak of her. Immediately, one threw oneself into feeling, into a refined and ecstatic admiration of the masters. Madame Du Joncquoy loved only Weber37, Madame Chantereau was for the Italians38. The voices of these ladies had become soft and languid. In front of the fireplace, one would have said it was the contemplation of a church, the discreet and swooning canticle of a little chapel.","The exclamation was general. No one offered a remark in reference to the piece produced at the Variety Theatre, and of which the worthy Madame Hugon had not understood anything ; the other ladies knew about it, but would say nothing. They at once went in for sentiment, and a refined and ecstatic admiration of the great masters. Madame du Joncquoy only cared for Weber, Madame Chantereau preferred the Italians. The sound of the ladies’ voices became soft and languid; one might have thought the group gathered round the fire to be a party at church, discreetly and faintly intoning a canticle in some little chapel.","The exclamation of surprise was general. No one had dropped a single word concerning the performance at the Varietes, at which the good Mme Hugon had not understood any of the allusions. The ladies knew the piece but said nothing about it, and with that they plunged into the realm of sentiment and began discussing the masters in a tone of refined and ecstatical admiration. Mme du Joncquoy was not fond of any of them save Weber, while Mme Chantereau stood up for the Italians. The ladies' voices had turned soft and languishing, and in front of the hearth one might have fancied one's self listening in meditative, religious retirement to the faint, discreet music of a little chapel.","The ladies all exclaimed. Nobody mentioned the show at the Variétés which Madame Hugon had failed to understand; they all knew everything about it but weren’t going to let on. They immediately started displaying their good taste and sensitivity in their fanatical admiration for the great composers. Madame Du Joncquoy loved only Weber, Madame Chantereau was for the Italians. Round the fireside, their voices became muted and gently wistful; they sounded like people in church, singing a discreetly ecstatic song of praise in some little chapel."

But she was already getting up, all on fire, saying:","And he implored the young woman to send word that she was engaged.

"Puis, elle continua ses grâces, pendant que Rose partait, suivie de Mignon, qui ne la reconnaissait plus. Clarisse, enchantée, venait d’obtenir de Bordenave le rôle de Géraldine. Fauchery, très sombre, piétinait sans pouvoir se décider à quitter le théâtre ; sa pièce était fichue, il cherchait comment la rattraper. Mais Nana vint le saisir par les poignets, l’approcha tout près d’elle, en demandant s’il la trouvait si atroce. Elle ne la lui mangerait pas, sa pièce ; et elle le fit rire, elle laissa entendre qu’il serait bête de se fâcher avec elle, dans sa position chez les Muffat. Si elle manquait de mémoire, elle prendrait du souffleur ; on ferait la salle45 ; d’ailleurs, il se trompait sur son compte, il verrait comme elle brûlerait les planches. Alors, on convint que l’auteur remanierait un peu le rôle de la duchesse, pour donner davantage à Prullière. Celui-ci fut ravi. Dans cette joie que Nana apportait naturellement avec elle, Fontan seul restait froid. Planté au milieu du rayon jaune de la servante46, il s’étalait, découpant l’arête vive de son profil de bouc, affectant une pose abandonnée. Et Nana, tranquillement, s’approcha, lui donna une poignée de main.","Then she continued her graces, while Rose left, followed by Mignon, who no longer recognized her. Clarisse, enchanted, had just obtained the role of Géraldine from Bordenave. Fauchery, very gloomy, walked on without being able to make up his mind to leave the theatre; his piece was ruined, he was trying to find a way to catch up with it. But Nana came and seized him by the wrists, pulled him close to her, asking if he found her so atrocious. She wouldn't eat it, his piece; and she made him laugh, she let it be understood that it would be foolish to get angry with her, in her position with the Muffats. If she lacked her memory, she would take the prompter; we would make the room45; besides, he was mistaken on his account, he would see how she would burn the boards. So it was agreed that the author would rework the role of the duchess a little, to give more to Prullière. This one was delighted. In this joy that Nana naturally brought with her, Fontan alone remained cold. Planted in the middle of the servant's yellow ray, he spread himself out, cutting the sharp edge of his goatee profile, affecting an abandoned pose. And Nana calmly approached him and shook his hand.","And she continued her airs, whilst Rose went off followed by Mignon, who scarcely knew her. Clarisse, to her great delight, had just had the part of Géraldine given to her by Bordenave. Fauchery moodily stamped about, without being able to make up his mind to leave the theatre. His piece would be damned; he was wondering how he could save it. But Nana went and seized hold of him by the wrists, and asked him if he thought her so very dreadful. She would not damn his piece; and she made him laugh, and let him understand that she might be of assistance to him with Muffat. If her memory failed her, she would make use of the prompter; they would pack the house. Besides, he was mistaken in her; he would see how she would carry all before her. Then it was settled that the author should slightly alter the part of the duchess, so as to give more to Prullière. The latter was delighted. In the general joy that Nana seemed naturally to bring with her, Fontan alone remained indifferent. Standing up, full in the yellow glare of the gas-jets, he showed himself off, displaying his sharp goat-like profile, and affecting an easy posture. Nana coolly went up to him, and holding out her hand, said,","And with that she continued in her graceful affectation while Rose took her departure, followed by Mignon, who now refused to recognize her. Clarisse was enraptured, having just obtained the part of Geraldine from Bordenave. Fauchery, on the other hand, was gloomy; he shifted from one foot to the other; he could not decide whether to leave the theater or no. His piece was bedeviled, and he was seeking how best to save it. But Nana came up, took him by both hands and, drawing him toward her, asked whether he thought her so very atrocious after all. She wasn't going to eat his play--not she! Then she made him laugh and gave him to understand that he would be foolish to be angry with her, in view of his relationship to the Muffats. If, she said, her memory failed her she would take her lines from the prompter. The house, too, would be packed in such a way as to ensure applause. Besides, he was mistaken about her, and he would soon see how she would rattle through her part. By and by it was arranged that the author should make a few changes in the role of the duchess so as to extend that of Prulliere. The last-named personage was enraptured. Indeed, amid all the joy which Nana now quite naturally diffused, Fontan alone remained unmoved. In the middle of the yellow lamplight, against which the sharp outline of his goatlike profile shone out with great distinctness, he stood showing off his figure and affecting the pose of one who has been cruelly abandoned. Nana went quietly up and shook hands with him.","And she continued her spiel while Rose went off, followed by Mignon who still couldn’t understand what had got into his wife. Clarisse was delighted at getting the part of Géraldine. Fauchery was shifting from one foot to another, looking very glum and unable to make up his mind whether to stay or leave: his play was a dead loss and he was wondering how he might salvage it. But then Nana came up to him and, catching hold of his wrists, pulled him close to her and asked if he really found her so dreadful. She wasn’t going to muck up his play for him. He couldn’t help laughing. She also hinted that he’d be very unwise to quarrel with her in view of his situation with the Muffats. Anyway, if her memory let her down, there was always the prompter to help her out. They’d pack the house with supporters. And in any case, he’d got it all wrong , he’d see that she’d bring the house down. It was agreed that the author would slightly rewrite the duchess’s part to give a bit more to Prullière. He was delighted. In this cheerful atmosphere that Nana had a natural gift for inspiring, only Fontan remained aloof. He was sprawling in a deliberately nonchalant attitude in the yellow beam of the tiny lamp, which picked out the sharp bony profile of his faun-like face. Nana calmly went over and shook his hand."

"Et la bonne dame le défendit contre une sourde hostilité qu’elle sentait. Son père, très estimé de Louis-Philippe14, avait occupé jusqu’à sa mort une préfecture.

"Ils quittèrent enfin le passage, et elle ne voulut pas de voiture. Il faisait très bon, disait-elle ; d’ailleurs, rien ne les pressait, ce serait charmant de rentrer à pied. Puis, arrivée devant le Café Anglais9, elle eut une envie, elle parla de manger des huîtres, racontant qu’elle n’avait rien pris depuis le matin, à cause de la maladie de Louiset. Muffat n’osa la contrarier. Il ne s’affichait pas encore avec elle, il demanda un cabinet10, filant vite le long des corridors. Elle le suivait en femme qui connaissait la maison, et ils allaient entrer dans un cabinet dont un garçon tenait la porte ouverte, lorsque, d’un salon voisin, où s’élevait une tempête de rires et de cris, un homme sortit brusquement. C'était Daguenet.","They finally left the passage, and she didn't want a car. The weather was very good, she said; besides, there was no hurry, it would be charming to return on foot. Then, arriving in front of the Café Anglais9, she had a desire, she talked about eating oysters, saying that she hadn't had anything since the morning, because of Louiset's illness. Muffat dared not cross her. He was not yet appearing with her, he asked for a cabinet10, darting quickly along the corridors. She was following him like a woman who knew the house, and they were about to enter a closet, the door of which a waiter was holding open, when, from a neighboring drawing-room, where a storm of laughter and cries arose, a man suddenly left. It was Daguenet.","They at length quitted the Passage, and she would not take a cab. It was very nice out of doors, said she; besides, there was no occasion to hurry , it would be delightful to walk home. Then, when they had got as far as the Café Anglais, she longed to have some oysters, saying that she had eaten nothing since the morning, on account of little Louis’s illness. Muffat did not like to disappoint her. As yet, he had not ventured much about with her in public, so he asked for a private room, and hurried along the corridor. She followed him slowly, like a woman thoroughly acquainted with the establishment, and they were just on the point of entering an apartment of which a waiter had opened the door, when a man suddenly rushed out of an adjoining room, from which issued a regular tempest of shouts and laughter.

Muffat dared not oppose her. Yet as he did not in those days wish to be seen about with her he asked for a private supper room and hurried to it along the corridors. She followed him with the air of a woman familiar with the house, and they were on the point of entering a private room, the door of which a waiter held open, when from a neighboring saloon, whence issued a perfect tempest of shouts and laughter, a man rapidiy emerged.

One moment she had the idea of sending George with a glass of champagne to Rose Mignon, who pretended she did not drink. Henri and Charles looked bored to death. The youngsters would have liked some champagne; but George, being afraid of a row, drank the wine himself. Then Nana recollected little Louis, whom she had forgotten behind her. Perhaps he was thirsty; and she got him to take a few drops of wine, which made him cough frightfully.","She thought him very droll and was greatly entertained. At one moment she conceived the idea of sending Georges with a glass of champagne to Rose Mignon, who was affecting temperance. Henri and Charles were bored to distraction; they would have been glad of some champagne, the poor little fellows. But Georges drank the glassful, for he feared an argument. Then Nana remembered Louiset, who was sitting forgotten behind her. Maybe he was thirsty, and she forced him to take a drop or two of wine, which made him cough dreadfully.","But she found him very funny and was in high good spirits. For a moment she was tempted to send a glass of champagne over to Rose Mignon, who was ostentatiously refusing to drink; Henri and Charles must be bored to tears, poor little chaps, they’d have loved a glass of bubbly. But not wishing to land himself in trouble, Georges downed the glass himself. Nana now remembered little Louis sitting neglected behind her; perhaps he was thirsty. She made him sip a few drops of wine, which brought on a terrible fit of coughing."

"Et, sur le siège, Nana, sans le savoir, avait pris un balancement des cuisses et des reins, comme si elle-même eût couru. Elle donnait des coups de ventre, il lui semblait que ça aidait la pouliche.

It was the last straw. She gave a blood-curdling scream."
"Un grand mouvement avait lieu autour de la table. Les garçons s’empressaient. Après les relevés, les entrées 24 venaient de paraître : des poulardes à la maréchale, des filets de sole sauce ravigote et des escalopes de foie gras. Le maître d’hôtel, qui avait fait verser jusque-là du Meursault, offrait du Chambertin et du Léoville. Dans le léger brouhaha du changement de service, Georges, de plus en plus étonné, demanda à Daguenet si toutes ces dames avaient comme ça des enfants ; et celui-ci, amusé par cette question, lui donna des détails. Lucy Stewart était fille d’un graisseur d’origine anglaise, employé à la gare du Nord ; trente-neuf ans, une tête de cheval, mais adorable, phtisique et ne mourant jamais ; la plus chic de ces dames, trois princes et un duc. Caroline Héquet, née à Bordeaux, d’un petit employé mort de honte, avait la bonne chance de posséder pour mère une femme de tête, qui, après l’avoir maudite, s’était remise avec elle, au bout d’un an de réflexion, voulant au moins lui sauver une fortune ; la fille, âgée de vingt-cinq ans, très froide, passait pour une des plus belles femmes qu’on pût avoir à un prix qui ne variait pas ; la mère, pleine d’ordre, tenait les livres, une comptabilité sévère des recettes et des dépenses, menait toute la maison de l’étroit logement qu’elle habitait deux étages plus haut, et où elle avait installé un atelier de couturières, pour les robes et le linge. Quant à Blanche de Sivry, de son vrai nom Jacqueline Baudu, elle venait d’un village près d’Amiens ; magnifique personne, bête et menteuse, se disant petite-fille d’un général et n’avouant pas ses trente-deux ans ; très goûtée des Russes, à cause de son embonpoint. Puis, rapidement, Daguenet ajouta un mot sur les autres : Clarisse Besnus, ramenée comme bonne de Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer 25 par une dame dont le mari l’avait lancée ; Simonne Cabiroche, fille d’un marchand de meubles du faubourg Saint-Antoine, élevée dans un grand pensionnat pour être institutrice ; et Maria Blond, et Louise Violaine, et Léa de Horn, toutes poussées sur le pavé parisien, sans compter Tatan Néné, qui avait gardé les vaches jusqu’à vingt ans, dans la Champagne pouilleuse26. Georges écoutait, regardant ces dames, étourdi et excité par ce déballage brutal, fait crûment à son oreille ; pendant que, derrière lui, les garçons répétaient d’une voix respectueuse :","A great movement took place around the table. The boys were rushing. After the statements, the starters 24 had just been published: chickens à la maréchale, fillets of sole with ravigote sauce and escalopes of foie gras. The butler, who had had Meursault poured up to that point, offered Chambertin and Léoville. In the light hubbub of the shift change, Georges, more and more astonished, asked Daguenet if all these ladies had children like that; and the latter, amused by this question, gave him details. Lucy Stewart was the daughter of a greaser of English origin, employed at the Gare du Nord; thirty-nine, a horse's head, but adorable, consumptive, and never dying; the smartest of these ladies, three princes and a duke. Caroline Héquet, born in Bordeaux to a lowly clerk who died of shame, had the good fortune to have a strong woman for a mother, who, after cursing her, got back together with her after a year. thoughtful, wanting to at least save him a fortune; the daughter, aged twenty-five, very cold, passed for one of the most beautiful women one could have at a price which did not vary; the mother, full of order, kept the books, a strict accounting of receipts and expenses, led the whole house from the cramped quarters she lived in two floors above, and where she had set up a seamstresses' workshop, to dresses and linens. As for Blanche de Sivry, whose real name was Jacqueline Baudu, she came from a village near Amiens; a magnificent person, stupid and a liar, calling herself the granddaughter of a general and not admitting that she was thirty-two years old; much liked by the Russians, because of his plumpness. Then, quickly, Daguenet added a word about the others: Clarisse Besnus, brought back as a maid from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer 25 by a lady whose husband had launched her; Simonne Cabiroche, daughter of a furniture dealer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, brought up in a large boarding school to be a teacher; and Maria Blond, and Louise Violaine, and Léa de Horn, all pushed onto the streets of Paris, not to mention Tatan Néné, who had kept the cows until the age of twenty, in lousy Champagne. Georges listened, looking at these ladies, stunned and excited by this brutal unpacking, made crudely in his ear; while, behind him, the boys repeated in a respectful voice:","There was a good deal of commotion going on round the table. The waiters hurried about. The next course, consisting of fattened pullets, fillets of sole and stewed liver, made its appearance. The head-waiter, who, in the way of wine, had up till then only offered Meursault, now sent round some Chambertin and some Léoville. In the slight hubbub occasioned by the changing of the plates, George, more surprised than ever, asked Daguenet if all the ladies had children; and he, amused by the questions, gave him a few particulars. Lucy Stewart was the daughter of a porter of English origin employed on the Northern Railway; she was thirty-nine years old, with the head of a horse, but nevertheless a most adorable person, frightfully consumptive yet never dying—the greatest swell of all the women there, and who could count amongst her conquests three princes and a duke. Caroline Héquet, who was born at Bordeaux, was the daughter of a clerk in humble circumstances, who died of shame. She had the good luck to possess a mother who was a strong-minded woman, and who, after cursing her and indulging in a year’s reflection, suddenly restored her to her place in the maternal affections, with the object of watching over her fortunes. The daughter, who was twenty-five years old, and of a very cold nature, enjoyed the reputation of being one of the prettiest women in the market, at the price that never varied. The mother, a very orderly woman, kept the books with the utmost accuracy as to profit and loss, and managed the entire establishment from the small apartment she occupied two floors above, and where she had set up a dressmaking business for the production of her daughter’s elegant costumes and underclothing. As for Blanche de Sivry, whose real name was Jacqueline Baudu, she came from a village near Amiens. She was magnificently shaped but was very stupid and a great liar, pretending her grandfather was a general and not owning to her thirty-two years. She was very much in vogue with the Russians, on account of her corpulence. Then Daguenet rapidly added a few details about the others. Clarisse Besnus was brought from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer to Paris by a lady as nursery maid, and was debauched by the husband, who started her in her new career. Simone Cabiroche, the daughter of a furniture dealer of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, was educated at a high-class school with the object of becoming a governess; and Maria Blond, and Louise Violaine, and Lea de Horn, had all been driven on to the streets, without counting Tatan Néné, who had tended cattle until twenty years old, in the beggarly Champagne. George listened, watching the women as he did so, and feeling quite dazed and excited by such a cynical undressing coarsely muttered into his ear; whilst, behind him, the waiters kept repeating in a respectful tone of voice, “Fattened pullet—fillet of sole.”","There was a considerable bustle round the table, and the waiters became very active. After the third course the entrees had made their appearance; they consisted of pullets a la marechale, fillets of sole with shallot sauce and escalopes of Strasbourg pate. The manager, who till then had been having Meursault served, now offered Chambertin and Leoville. Amid the slight hubbub which the change of plates involved Georges, who was growing momentarily more astonished, asked Daguenet if all the ladies present were similarly provided with children, and the other, who was amused by this question, gave him some further details. Lucy Stewart was the daughter of a man of English origin who greased the wheels of the trains at the Gare du Nord; she was thirty-nine years old and had the face of a horse but was adorable withal and, though consumptive, never died. In fact, she was the smartest woman there and represented three princes and a duke. Caroline Hequet, born at Bordeaux, daughter of a little clerk long since dead of shame, was lucky enough to be possessed of a mother with a head on her shoulders, who, after having cursed her, had made it up again at the end of a year of reflection, being minded, at any rate, to save a fortune for her daughter. The latter was twenty-five years old and very passionless and was held to be one of the finest women it is possible to enjoy. Her price never varied. The mother, a model of orderliness, kept the accounts and noted down receipts and expenditures with severe precision. She managed the whole household from some small lodging two stories above her daughter's, where, moreover, she had established a workroom for dressmaking and plain sewing. As to Blanche de Sivry, whose real name was Jacqueline Bandu, she hailed from a village near Amiens. Magnificent in person, stupid and untruthful in character, she gave herself out as the granddaughter of a general and never owned to her thirty-two summers. The Russians had a great taste for her, owing to her embonpoint. Then Daguenet added a rapid word or two about the rest. There was Clarisse Besnus, whom a lady had brought up from Saint- Aubin-sur-Mer in the capacity of maid while the lady's husband had started her in quite another line. There was Simonne Cabiroche, the daughter of a furniture dealer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, who had been educated in a large boarding school with a view to becoming a governess. Finally there were Maria Blond and Louise Violaine and Lea de Horn, who had all shot up to woman's estate on the pavements of Paris, not to mention Tatan Nene, who had herded cows in Champagne till she was twenty. Georges listened and looked at these ladies, feeling dizzy and excited by the coarse recital thus crudely whispered in his ear, while behind his chair the waiters kept repeating in respectful tones:","There was a great stir round the table; the waiters were bustling around to serve the next course: poularde à la maréchale, fillets of sole ravigote, and slices of foie gras. The butler, who up till now had been serving Meursault, switched to Chambertin and Léoville. * In the slight disturbance caused by the change of service, Georges, who’d been more and more surprised, asked Daguenet if all those ladies had children like that. Daguenet was amused at the question and gave him some details. Lucy Stewart was the daughter of an Englishman working as a greaser at the Gare du Nord; she was 39 years old, with a face like a horse but adorable, suffering from TB, but still going strong, the smartest of all those ladies, having notched up three princes and a duke. Caroline Héquet had been born in Bordeaux. Her father, a minor office clerk, had died of shame, but she’d had the luck to have a hard-headed mother who, after first of all disowning her, had had second thoughts and a year later had joined up with her again, anxious at least to make sure that her money would be safe; the daughter was 25, a cold fish, with the reputation of being one of the loveliest women you could get for a price that never varied. Her mother was highly efficient, kept a strict account of income and expenditure, and managed the household’s affairs from a small apartment two floors up from her daughter’s, where she’d also set up a dressmaker’s workshop to supply her dresses and lingerie. As for Blanche de Sivry, she was from a village near Amiens; her real name was Jacqueline Baudu, she had a superb figure, was stupid and a liar, claiming to be the granddaughter of a general and refusing to admit she was 32 years old; very popular with Russians, because she was plump. Daguenet added a few details about some of the others: Clarisse Besnus, brought to Paris as her maid by a lady from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer,* whose husband had launched her on her career; Simonne Cabiroche, daughter of a furniture-dealer in the Faubourg Saint Antoine* and educated in an excellent boarding-school to become an elementary-school mistress; as for Maria Blond, Louise Violaine, and Léa de Horn, their entire education had come from the streets of Paris, whereas up to the age of 20 Tatan Néné had looked after the cows in her native Champagne Pouilleuse. * As he was listening, Georges watched these women, shocked and excited by these devastatingly frank and crude disclosures which Daguenet was whispering in his ear. Meanwhile behind them there came the steady murmur of the waiters:"
"Georges, descendu de voiture dans l’éblouissement d’un long désir enfin contenté, n’avait pas même vu les lieux où il entrait. Alors, il eut conscience d’un changement autour de lui. Il examina la riche salle à manger, avec son haut plafond décoré, ses Gobelins, son dressoir 23 éblouissant d’argenterie.","Georges, alighting from the carriage in the dazzle of a long desire finally satisfied, had not even seen the places he was entering.

"Mais elle l’avait devancé, elle lui criait de ne pas se déranger, qu’elle visiterait elle-même, qu’elle aimait mieux ça. Et, sans ôter son chapeau, elle se lança dans les pièces, appelant Zoé, lui jetant des réflexions d’un bout à l’autre des couloirs, emplissant de ses cris et de ses rires le vide de cette maison inhabitée depuis de longs mois. D’abord, le vestibule : un peu humide, mais ça ne faisait rien, on n’y couchait pas. Très chic le salon, avec ses fenêtres ouvertes sur une pelouse ; seulement, le meuble rouge était affreux, elle changerait ça. Quant à la salle à manger, hein ! la belle salle à manger ! et quelles noces on donnerait à Paris, si l’on avait une salle à manger de cette taille ! Comme elle montait au premier étage, elle se souvint qu’elle n’avait pas vu la cuisine ; elle redescendit en s’exclamant, Zoé dut s’émerveiller sur la beauté de l’évier et sur la grandeur de l’âtre2, où l’on aurait fait rôtir un mouton. Lorsqu’elle fut remontée, sa chambre surtout l’enthousiasma, une chambre qu’un tapissier d’Orléans avait tendue de cretonne Louis XVI, rose tendre. Ah bien ! on devait joliment dormir là-dedans ! un vrai nid de pensionnaire ! Ensuite quatre ou cinq chambres d’amis, puis des greniers magnifiques ; c’était très commode pour les malles. Zoé, rechignant, jetant un coup d’œil froid dans chaque pièce, s’attardait derrière madame. Elle la regarda disparaître en haut de l’échelle raide des greniers. Merci ! elle n’avait pas envie de se casser les jambes. Mais une voix lui arriva, lointaine, comme soufflée dans un tuyau de cheminée.","But she had preceded him, she shouted at him not to bother, that she would visit herself, that she liked it better. And, without taking off her hat, she rushed into the rooms, calling Zoe, throwing reflections at her from one end of the corridors to the other, filling with her cries and her laughter the emptiness of this house which had been uninhabited for many long months. . First, the vestibule: a little damp, but that didn't matter, we didn't sleep there. The living room is very chic, with its windows opening onto a lawn; only the red cabinet was awful, she would change that. As for the dining room, huh! the beautiful dining room! and what a wedding would be given in Paris if there was a dining room of this size! As she went up to the first floor, she remembered that she had not seen the kitchen; she came back down exclaiming, Zoe must have marveled at the beauty of the sink and the size of the hearth,2 where they would have roasted a sheep. When she came upstairs, she was especially enthusiastic about her room, a room that an upholsterer from Orleans had hung with soft pink Louis XVI cretonne. Ah well ! we must have slept nicely in there! a real boarder's nest! Then four or five guest rooms, then magnificent attics; it was very convenient for the trunks. Zoe, reluctantly, glancing coldly at each room, lingered behind Madame. She watched her disappear up the steep attic ladder. Thank you ! she didn't want to break her legs. But a voice came to him, distant, as if blown into a chimney flue.","But Nana, who was some distance ahead, called to him not to trouble himself, she would look at everything by herself, she preferred that; and, without taking off her bonnet, she ran about the rooms, calling to Zoé, giving her opinion about everything, and filling with her shouts and her laughter the vacuum of that house which had remained uninhabited for so many long months. First, there was the hall; it was rather damp, but that did not matter, no one would have to sleep there. Then the drawing-room, which was splendid with its large windows opening on to the lawn; only, the red-covered furniture was frightful, she would have it altered. As for the dining-room, it was simply magnificent. And what parties one could give at Paris if one only had a dining-room of that size! As she was going up to the first floor she recollected that she had not seen the kitchen; she went down again, uttering all kinds of exclamations, and Zoé had to admire the beauty of the sink and the magnitude of the fire-place, which was large enough to roast a sheep. When she had gone up-stairs again, her bedroom especially enraptured her—it had been hung with pale rose-coloured cretonne, style of Louis XVI. , by an upholsterer from Orleans. Well, one ought to sleep well in there , it was quite a school-girls’ nest! There were also four or five other bed-rooms for guests, and some magnificent attics, which would be very useful for the trunks. Zoé, looking very sulky, just glanced coldly into each room, and kept a long way behind madame. She watched her disappear at the top of the steep ladder which led to the roof. Thank you for nothing! she didn’t want to break her legs. But the sound of a voice reached her from afar off, as though coming down a chimney.","But she had outrun him entirely, and she shouted back that he was not to put himself out and that she would go over the house by herself. She preferred doing that, she said. And without removing her hat she dashed into the different rooms, calling to Zoe as she did so, shouting her impressions from one end of each corridor to the other and filling the empty house, which for long months had been uninhabited, with exclamations and bursts of laughter. In the first place, there was the hall. It was a little damp, but that didn't matter; one wasn't going to sleep in it. Then came the drawing room, quite the thing, the drawing room, with its windows opening on the lawn. Only the red upholsteries there were hideous; she would alter all that. As to the dining room-well, it was a lovely dining room, eh? What big blowouts you might give in Paris if you had a dining room as large as that! As she was going upstairs to the first floor it occurred to her that she had not seen the kitchen, and she went down again and indulged in ecstatic exclamations. Zoe ought to admire the beautiful dimensions of the sink and the width of the hearth, where you might have roasted a sheep! When she had gone upstairs again her bedroom especially enchanted her. It had been hung with delicate rose-colored Louis XVI cretonne by an Orleans upholsterer. Dear me, yes! One ought to sleep jolly sound in such a room as that; why, it was a real best bedroom! Then came four or five guest chambers and then some splendid garrets, which would be extremely convenient for trunks and boxes. Zoe looked very gruff and cast a frigid glance into each of the rooms as she lingered in Madame's wake. She saw Nana disappearing up the steep garret ladder and said, ""Thanks, I haven't the least wish to break my legs."" But the sound of a voice reached her from far away; indeed, it seemed to come whistling down a chimney.","But she’d gone on ahead, shouting that he needn’t bother, she’d sooner go over it by herself. And without stopping to take off her hat, she rushed through the various rooms, telling Zoé to follow, tossing comments over her shoulder as she ran along the corridors and making this empty house, which had been unoccupied for many months, echo with her laughter and her exclamations. First it was the entrance hall: a trifle damp, what did it matter, nobody would be sleeping there! The drawing-room: very smart, with windows looking out over a lawn; only the red material of the furniture was dreadful, she’d be changing all that. And as for the dining-room, well, how about that now, wasn’t it magnificent! And think of all the wonderful parties you’d be able to give if you had a dining-room that size in Paris! As she was going up to the first floor, she remembered she hadn’t looked at the kitchen, so she ran down again. There were further exclamations; Zoé had to be duly impressed by the beautiful sink and the huge fireplace where you could have roasted a sheep. When she went upstairs again, Nana was particularly excited by her bedroom with its delicate, pink, Louis XVI cretonne hangings from an Orléans upholsterer. Well, you’d certainly enjoy sleeping there! A real cosy schoolgirl’s den! Then came four or five guest-rooms and magnificent attics, very handy for trunks. Zoé was lagging behind, fed up and not showing much enthusiasm as she viewed each room. She watched her mistress disappear up the steep ladder leading to the attic. She’d no wish to break her leg , thanks very much! However, she could hear the distant sound of a voice, muffled as if coming down a chimney."

Satin listened to her complacently, consoled her, was more indignant than she, hitting on the men.","When they had fastened themselves in, Nana, who up till then had not unbosomed herself, burst into tears, and related again and again the dirty trick that Fontan had played her.

Satin listened complaisantly, comforted her, grew even more angry than she in denunciation of the male sex.","As soon as the door was closed behind them, Nana, who’d been holding herself in, burst into tears and told Satin over and over again about Fontan’s disgusting behaviour.

"La foule augmentait toujours. Dans le coup de lumière des boutiques, sous les nappes dansantes du gaz, on distinguait le double courant des trottoirs, qui charriait des chapeaux.

"Midi sonnait. C'était plus de trois heures à attendre, pour la course du Grand Prix. Lorsque le landau se fut rangé contre la barrière, Nana se mit à l’aise, comme chez elle. Elle avait eu le caprice d’amener Bijou et Louiset. Le chien, couché dans ses jupes, tremblait de froid, malgré la chaleur ; tandis que l’enfant, attifé de rubans et de dentelles, avait une pauvre petite figure de cire, muette, pâlie, par le grand air. Cependant, la jeune femme, sans s’inquiéter des voisins, causait très haut avec Georges et Philippe Hugon, assis devant elle, sur l’autre banquette, parmi un tel tas de bouquets, des roses blanches et des myosotis bleus, qu’ils disparaissaient jusqu’aux épaules.","Midday struck. It was over three hours to wait, for the Grand Prix race. When the pram had pulled up against the rail, Nana made herself as comfortable as at home. She had had the caprice to bring Bijou and Louiset. The dog, lying in her petticoats, was shivering with cold, in spite of the heat; while the child, decked out in ribbons and lace, had a poor little wax face, mute, pale from the open air. However, the young woman, without worrying about the neighbors, was talking very loudly with Georges and Philippe Hugon, seated in front of her, on the other bench, among such a heap of bouquets, white roses and blue forget-me-nots, that they disappeared down to the shoulders.","The dog, asleep amongst her skirts, was shivering in spite of the heat, whilst the child, dressed up in ribbons and lace, remained as though dumb, and had become so pale from the force of the wind that he looked like a wax figure.

It was just striking twelve; there were more than three hours to wait before the Grand Prix. Once her landau was parked beside the barrier, Nana was able to relax, completely at home. She’d had the odd idea of bringing Louiset along with her as well as Bijou, who was now lying on her lap trembling with cold in spite of the warm day, while the little boy, decked out in lace and ribbons, had a pinched, wan little face, even paler from exposure to the fresh air, and was sitting in frozen silence. Meanwhile, regardless of the people around, his mother was talking very loudly with Georges and Philippe Hugon sitting opposite her and almost covered up to the neck in a heap of bunches of flowers, white roses, and blue forget-me-nots."

"Ce qui inquiétait surtout Nana, c’était la sincérité de ces basses débauches. Elle se rappelait ses comédies du plaisir, lorsqu’elle était une femme lancée ; tandis qu’elle voyait les filles, autour d’elle, y crever un peu tous les jours. Puis, Satin lui faisait une peur abominable de la police. Elle était pleine d’histoires, sur ce sujet-là. Autrefois, elle couchait avec un agent des mœurs, pour qu’on la laissât tranquille ; à deux reprises, il avait empêché qu’on ne la mît en carte74 ; et, à présent, elle tremblait, car son affaire était claire, si on la pinçait encore. Il fallait l’entendre. Les agents, pour avoir des gratifications, arrêtaient le plus de femmes possible ; ils empoignaient tout, ils vous faisaient taire d’une gifle si l’on criait, certains d’être soutenus et récompensés, même quand ils avaient pris dans le tas une honnête fille. L’été, à douze ou quinze, ils opéraient des rafles sur le boulevard, ils cernaient un trottoir, pêchaient jusqu’à des trente femmes en une soirée. Seulement Satin connaissait les endroits ; dès qu’elle apercevait le nez des agents, elle s’envolait, au milieu de la débandade effarée des longues queues fuyant à travers la foule. C'était une épouvante de la loi, une terreur de la préfecture, si grande, que certaines restaient paralysées sur la porte des cafés, dans le coup de force qui balayait l’avenue. Mais Satin redoutait davantage les dénonciations ; son pâtissier s’était montré assez mufe pour la menacer de la vendre, lorsqu’elle l’avait quitté ; oui, des hommes vivaient sur leurs maîtresses avec ce truc-là, sans compter de sales femmes qui vous livraient très bien par traîtrise, si l’on était plus jolie qu’elles. Nana écoutait ces choses, prise de frayeurs croissantes. Elle avait toujours tremblé devant la loi, cette puissance inconnue, cette vengeance des hommes qui pouvaient la supprimer, sans que personne au monde la défendît. Saint-Lazare 75 lui apparaissait comme une fosse, un trou noir où l’on enterrait les femmes vivantes, après leur avoir coupé les cheveux76. Elle se disait bien qu’il lui aurait suffi de lâcher Fontan pour trouver des protections ; Satin avait beau lui parler de certaines listes de femmes, accompagnées de photographies, que les agents devaient consulter, avec défense de jamais toucher à celles-là : elle n’en gardait pas moins un tremblement, elle se voyait toujours bousculée, traînée, jetée le lendemain à la visite ; et ce fauteuil de la visite l’emplissait d’angoisse et de honte, elle qui avait lancé vingt fois sa chemise par-dessus les moulins.","What worried Nana above all was the sincerity of these base debaucheries. She remembered her comedies of pleasure, when she was a launched woman; while she saw the girls around her die a little every day. Then Satin frightened her abominably of the police. She was full of stories on that subject. Formerly, she slept with a morality officer, to be left alone; twice he had prevented it from being put on the map; and now she was trembling, for her business was clear if they pinched her again. You had to hear it. The agents, in order to obtain gratuities, arrested as many women as possible; they grabbed everything, they silenced you with a slap if you shouted, certain of being supported and rewarded, even when they had caught an honest girl in the crowd. In the summer, at twelve or fifteen, they carried out raids on the boulevard, they surrounded a sidewalk, caught up to thirty women in one evening. Only Satin knew the places; as soon as she saw the noses of the agents, she flew away, amidst the bewildered stampede of long queues fleeing through the crowd. It was a terror of the law, a terror of the prefecture, so great that some remained paralyzed on the doors of the cafes, in the coup de force which swept the avenue. But Satin was more afraid of denunciations; her pastry cook had been mute enough to threaten to sell her when she left him; yes, men lived on their mistresses with that thing, not to mention dirty women who delivered you very well out of treachery, if you were prettier than them. Nana listened to these things, seized with growing fears. She had always trembled before the law, that unknown power, that vengeance of men who could suppress her without anyone in the world defending her. Saint-Lazare 75 seemed to him like a pit, a black hole where women were buried alive, after having cut their hair. She told herself that it would have been enough for her to let go of Fontan to find protection; In vain did Satin talk to her about certain lists of women, accompanied by photographs, which the agents had to consult, with the prohibition of ever touching those: she still had a tremor, she always saw herself being jostled, dragged, thrown the next day at the visit; and this armchair of the visit filled her with anguish and shame, she who had thrown her shirt twenty times over the mills.","What most troubled Nana was the sincerity of these low debaucheries. She recalled to mind her comedies of pleasure, during the days of her fast life; whilst she saw the girls about her losing their health at it day by day. Then Satin frightened her terribly with the police. She was full of stories about them. Once she used to keep up an acquaintance with one of the inspectors of public morals, so as to insure being left alone; on two occasions he had prevented her name from being entered in their books, and now she trembled, for she knew what to expect if they caught her a third time. It was shocking to hear her. The police arrested as many women as they possibly could, in order to get bribes, they seized all they came across, and silenced you with a slap in the mouth if you cried out, for they were certain of being upheld and rewarded, even though there happened to be a respectable girl among the number. In the summer they would start off, twelve or fifteen together, and make a round-up on the Boulevards, surrounding one of the footpaths, and securing as many as thirty women in an evening. Satin, however, knew their favourite spots. As soon as ever she caught a glimpse of a policeman, away she bolted, amidst the wild flight of the long trains, through the crowd. There was a dread of the law, a terror of the Prefecture of Police so great that many remained as though paralysed at the doors of the cafés, in spite of the advancing policemen, who swept the road before them. But Satin most dreaded being informed against; her pastry cook had been mean enough to threaten to denounce her when he left her. Yes, some men lived on their mistresses by those means, without counting the dirty women who would betray you through jealousy, if you were better looking than they. Nana listened to all these stories which greatly increased her fears. She had always trembled at the name of the law—that unknown power, that vengance of men which could suppress her, without anyone in the world defending her. The prison of Saint-Lazare appeared to her like a tomb, an enormous black hole, in which women were buried alive, after having had their hair cut off. She would say to herself that she had only to give up Fontan to find no end of protectors; and Satin might tell her hundreds of times of certain lists of women, accompanied by their photographs, that the policemen had to consult, and be careful never to interfere with the originals. She was nevertheless dreadfully frightened, she was always seeing herself jostled and dragged off to be inspected on the morrow; and the idea of the inspection filled her with agony and shame, she who had so often thrown her chemise over the house-tops.","The sincerity of these low debauches rendered Nana especially uneasy. Seeing the courtesans around her slowly dying of it every day, she recalled to mind the comedy of pleasure she had taken part in when she was in the heyday of success. Moreover, Satin inspired her with an awful fear of the police. She was full of anecdotes about them. Formerly she had been the mistress of a plain-clothes man, had consented to this in order to be left in peace, and on two occasions he had prevented her from being put ""on the lists."" But at present she was in a great fright, for if she were to be nabbed again there was a clear case against her. You had only to listen to her! For the sake of perquisites the police used to take up as many women as possible. They laid hold of everybody and quieted you with a slap if you shouted, for they were sure of being defended in their actions and rewarded, even when they had taken a virtuous girl among the rest. In the summer they would swoop upon the boulevard in parties of twelve or fifteen, surround a whole long reach of sidewalk and fish up as many as thirty women in an evening. Satin, however, knew the likely places, and the moment she saw a plain- clothes man heaving in sight she took to her heels, while the long lines of women on the pavements scattered in consternation and fled through the surrounding crowd. The dread of the law and of the magistracy was such that certain women would stand as though paralyzed in the doorways of the cafes while the raid was sweeping the avenue without. But Satin was even more afraid of being denounced, for her pastry cook had proved blackguard enough to threaten to sell her when she had left him. Yes, that was a fake by which men lived on their mistresses! Then, too, there were the dirty women who delivered you up out of sheer treachery if you were prettier than they! Nana listened to these recitals and felt her terrors growing upon her. She had always trembled before the law, that unknown power, that form of revenge practiced by men able and willing to crush her in the certain absence of all defenders. Saint-Lazare she pictured as a grave, a dark hole, in which they buried live women after they had cut off their hair. She admitted that it was only necessary to leave Fontan and seek powerful protectors. But as matters stood it was in vain that Satin talked to her of certain lists of women's names, which it was the duty of the plainclothes men to consult, and of certain photographs accompanying the lists, the originals of which were on no account to be touched. The reassurance did not make her tremble the less, and she still saw herself hustled and dragged along and finally subjected to the official medical inspection. The thought of the official armchair filled her with shame and anguish, for had she not bade it defiance a score of times?","The thing which bothered Nana most was the genuineness of this disgusting debauchery. She remembered how, at the time of her theatrical success, she would pretend to be enjoying such things, whereas now she found herself surrounded by tarts who every day were gradually succumbing to their way of life. What was worse was that Satin had made her scared stiff of the police. She had a whole stock of stories on the subject. She’d previously been going to bed with a member of the vice squad so as to be left in peace; he’d twice been able to help her to avoid having to register as a prostitute,* and she was terrified that if they nabbed her once more, she’d be sunk … And that wasn’t all! To qualify for a bonus, police officers would arrest as many women as possible; they’d haul in everyone, and if you made a fuss they’d shut you up with a slap in the face, certain of being backed up by the authorities and rewarded, even if they hauled in a respectable girl. In the summer, groups of twelve to fifteen of them would operate round-ups on the boulevards; they would close off a stretch of pavement and pick up as many as thirty women in one night. But Satin knew the spots they worked in, and as soon as she caught sight of a policeman she’d make herself scarce among the panic-stricken women in long skirts trying to slip away in the crowd. The women were so terrified of the power of the law and the dreaded central police headquarters that some of them would stand rooted to the spot outside the cafés as the police swept ruthlessly up the street. But Satin was even more scared of being framed; her pastry cook had been such a bastard as to threaten to turn her in after she’d left him: yes, there were men who used that trick to live off their girl-friend’s earnings, quite apart from bloody-minded women who might very well put the police on to you behind your back, just because you were prettier than they were. As she listened to these tales, Nana became more and more frightened. She’d always had a fear of the law, that unknown power by which men could wreak vengeance on her and eliminate her without anyone being able to defend her. She saw Saint-Lazare* as a pit, a dark hole in which women were buried alive after having their hair cut off. She told herself that of course she only needed to dump Fontan in order to get protection. Satin had told her about lists of women’s names, with their photos, which the police had to consult; and they had been told not to molest any women on the lists. But Nana was still apprehensive; she could see herself being hustled and dragged away and next day having to submit to a medical examination, and the thought of lying exposed on the doctor’s chair shocked and distressed her, even though she’d done far more indecent things dozens of times before."

"Ce qui suivit acheva d’empoigner la salle. Diane s’en était allée, furieuse. Tout de suite, assise sur un banc de mousse, Vénus appela Mars auprès d’elle. Jamais encore on n’avait osé une scène de séduction plus chaude. Nana, les bras au cou de Prullière, l’attirait, lorsque Fontan, se livrant à une mimique de fureur cocasse, exagérant le masque d’un époux outragé qui surprend sa femme en flagrant délit, parut dans le fond de la grotte. Il tenait le fameux filet aux mailles de fer103. Un instant, il le balança, pareil à un pêcheur qui va jeter un coup d’épervier ; et, par un truc ingénieux, Vénus et Mars furent pris au piège, le filet les enveloppa, les immobilisa dans leur posture d’amants heureux.","What followed finished gripping the room. Diane had left, furious. Immediately, sitting on a bench of moss, Venus called Mars to her side. Never before had we dared to perform a hotter seduction scene. Nana, her arms around Prullière's neck, was attracting him, when Fontan, giving himself up to a mimicry of comical fury, exaggerating the mask of an outraged husband who surprises his wife in flagrante delicto, appeared at the back of the grotto. He held the famous iron-mesh net. For a moment he swung it, like a fisherman about to cast a cast net; and, by an ingenious trick, Venus and Mars were trapped, the net enveloped them, immobilized them in their posture of happy lovers.","The acting which followed quite took the house by storm. Diana having gone off furious, Venus, seated on a bed of moss, at once called Mars to her side. Never before had so warm a scene of seduction been risked upon the stage. Nana, her arms around Prullière’s neck, was slowly drawing him to her, when Fontan, grotesquely imitating the most awful fury, exaggerating the looks of an outraged husband who surprises his wife in the very act, appeared at the back of the grotto. In his hands he held his famous iron net; for a moment he poised it like a fisherman about to throw, then, by some ingenious device, Venus and Mars were ensnared, the net covered them, and held them fast in their guilty posture.","What followed took the house by storm completely. Diana had gone off in a rage, and directly afterward, Venus, sitting on a moss-clad seat, called Mars to her. Never yet had a more glowing scene of seduction been ventured on. Nana, her arms round Prulliere's neck, was drawing him toward her when Fontan, with comically furious mimicry and an exaggerated imitation of the face of an outraged husband who surprises his wife in FLAGRANTE DELICTO, appeared at the back of the grotto. He was holding the famous net with iron meshes. For an instant he poised and swung it, as a fisherman does when he is going to make a cast, and by an ingenious twist Venus and Mars were caught in the snare; the net wrapped itself round them and held them motionless in the attitude of happy lovers.","What now followed riveted the spellbound audience: Diana had flounced off in a fury and Venus immediately summoned Mars to join her where she was sitting on a mossy bank. Never before had such a daringly erotic seduction scene been put on the stage: putting her arms round Prullière’s neck, Nana was pulling him closer when Fontan appeared at the back of the grotto comically mimicking the fury of a husband outraged at catching his wife flagrante delicto. He was holding his famous net of iron-mail, which he swung for a second round his head like a fisherman and skilfully trapped them, leaving them unable to move in their close embrace."

Et il ne se révoltait plus, cette chambre de malade, si tiède et si endormie, trempée d’éther, avait achevé de l’assoupir dans un besoin de paix heureuse. Toute sa virilité, enragée par l’injure, s’en était allée à la chaleur de ce lit, près de cette femme souffrante, qu’il soignait, avec l’excitation de sa fièvre et le ressouvenir de leurs voluptés.

His male pride, which had been so offended and inflamed, had evaporated in the excitement of her own feverish state and the warmth of her bed which, as he sat beside her, caring for her in her suffering, brought back once again memories of their pleasures. He bent forward and hugged her tightly, while on her impassive face her lips curled in a sly smile of triumph. At this moment Doctor Boutarel came in."

"À deux reprises, il s’était battu41. On le saluait, on l’admettait partout. Ce fut un soulèvement général contre Foucarmont. La table s’égayait, le trouvant très spirituel ; mais ce n’était pas une raison pour gâter la nuit. Vandeuvres, dont le fin visage se cuivrait, exigea qu’il rendît son sexe à Labordette. Les autres hommes, Mignon, Steiner, Bordenave, très lancés, intervinrent aussi, criant, couvrant sa voix. Et seul, le vieux monsieur, qu’on oubliait près de Nana, gardait son grand air, son sourire las et muet, en suivant de ses yeux pâles cette débâcle du dessert.","Twice he had fought. They saluted him, they admitted him everywhere. It was a general uprising against Foucarmont. The table was becoming more cheerful, finding him very witty; but that was no reason to spoil the night. Vandeuvres, whose delicate face was becoming copper, demanded that he give back his penis to Labordette. The other men, Mignon, Steiner, Bordenave, very excited, also intervened, shouting, covering his voice. And only the old gentleman, whom they forgot near Nana, kept his grand air, his weary, silent smile, as he followed this debacle of the dessert with his pale eyes.","He had fought in two duels—he was admitted and welcomed everywhere; so there was a general rising against Foucarmont. Every one was amused, thinking him very funny; but that was no reason for upsetting the harmony of the evening. Vandeuvres, whose fine face wore a dark look, insisted on his restoring Labordette his sex. The other men, Mignon, Steiner, Bordenave, all very far gone, interfered also, shouting so as to drown his voice; and the old gentleman, who was quite forgotten in his seat beside Nana, alone preserved his distinguished look, his quiet, weary smile, as he watched with his pale eyes the tumult around him.","Foucarmont had twice fought duels, and he was in consequence most politely treated and admitted into every circle. But there was now a general uprising against him. The table grew merry at his sallies, for they thought him very witty, but that was no reason why the evening should be spoiled. Vandeuvres, whose subtle countenance was darkening visibly, insisted on his restoring Labordette his sex. The other men--Mignon, Steiner and Bordenave--who were by this time much exalted, also intervened with shouts which drowned his voice. Only the old gentleman sitting forgotten next to Nana retained his stately demeanor and, still smiling in his tired, silent way, watched with lackluster eyes the untoward finish of the dessert.","He’d already fought a couple of duels. He was accepted everywhere and no one would ever have thought of snubbing him. Everybody was up in arms against Foucarmont; he might be witty and make people laugh, but that was no excuse for ruining the party. Vandeuvres’s fine-drawn features were slightly flushed; he insisted on Foucarmont’s withdrawing his aspersions on Labordette’s sex. The others, Mignon, Steiner, and Bordenave, were also keen to have their say, and were drowning his voice with the sound of their own.

"C'était un sentiment d’angoisse qui commençait à étrangler tout ce monde entassé. Encore une défaite ! et une ardeur de vœu extraordinaire, presque religieuse, montait pour Lusignan ; pendant qu’on injuriait Spirit, avec son jockey d’une gaieté de croque-mort. Parmi la foule éparse dans l’herbe, un souffle enlevait des bandes, les semelles en l’air. Des cavaliers coupaient la pelouse d’un galop furieux. Et Nana, qui tournait lentement sur elle-même, voyait à ses pieds cette houle de bêtes et de gens, cette mer de têtes battue et comme emportée autour de la piste par le tourbillon de la course, rayant l’horizon du vif éclair des jockeys. Elle les avait suivis de dos, dans la fuite des croupes, dans la vitesse allongée des jambes, qui se perdaient et prenaient des finesses de cheveux. Maintenant, au fond, ils filaient de profil, tout petits, délicats, sur les lointains verdâtres du Bois. Puis, brusquement, ils disparurent derrière un grand bouquet d’arbres, plantés au milieu de l’Hippodrome.","It was a feeling of anguish that was beginning to strangle all the crowded people. Another defeat! and an extraordinary, almost religious ardor rose up for Lusignan; while they swore at Spirit, with his jockey with the gaiety of an undertaker. Among the scattered crowd in the grass, a breath removed bands, soles in the air. Horsemen cut the lawn at a furious gallop. And Nana, who was turning slowly on her axis, saw at her feet this swell of animals and people, this sea of heads beaten and as if carried around the track by the whirlwind of the race, streaking the horizon with the bright flash of jockeys. She had followed them from behind, in the flight of the croups, in the elongated speed of the legs, which were lost and took on fine hair. Now, in the background, they were speeding along in profile, very small, delicate, on the greenish distances of the Wood. Then, suddenly, they disappeared behind a large clump of trees, planted in the middle of the Hippodrome.","A feeling of anguish gradually overwhelmed that mob of people. Another defeat! And a wish of extraordinary ardour, amounting almost to a prayer, for Lusignan’s success was inwardly expressed by all; whilst they abused Spirit and his funereal-looking jockey. The crowd, scattered over the grass, broke up into bands who were running with all their might. Horsemen galloped swiftly over the ground. And Nana, turning slowly round, beheld at her feet that surging mob of men and animals—that sea of heads looking as though dashed about and carried along the course by the vortex of the race, streaking the bright horizon of the jockeys. She watched the fast-stepping legs, which, as the distance increased, assumed the slenderness of hairs. Now, at the farthest limit of the circle, she saw them sideways, looking so small and slight against the green background of the Bois. Then suddenly they disappeared behind a large cluster of trees close to the course.","A feeling of anguish was beginning to choke all that crowded multitude. Another defeat! And with that a strange ardent prayer, which was almost religious, went up for Lusignan, while people heaped abuse on Spirit and his dismal mute of a jockey. Among the crowd scattered over the grass the wind of excitement put up whole groups of people and set their boot soles flashing in air as they ran. Horsemen crossed the green at a furious gallop. And Nana, who was slowly revolving on her own axis, saw beneath her a surging waste of beasts and men, a sea of heads swayed and stirred all round the course by the whirlwind of the race, which clove the horizon with the bright lightning flash of the jockeys. She had been following their movement from behind while the cruppers sped away and the legs seemed to grow longer as they raced and then diminished till they looked slender as strands of hair. Now the horses were running at the end of the course, and she caught a side view of them looking minute and delicate of outline against the green distances of the Bois. Then suddenly they vanished behind a great clump of trees growing in the middle of the Hippodrome.","The packed crowd was seized by a dreadful foreboding. Thrashed again! A tremendous ground-swell of support of almost religious intensity was rising in favour of Lusignan; Spirit was being showered with abuse, as well as that miserable jockey of his who looked as if he was at a funeral. Among the spectators dispersed round the course enthusiasm was rising to fever-pitch, with partisan gangs rushing at top speed over to the barrier to get a better view; men on horseback were furiously galloping across the enclosure. Twisting round to watch, Nana could see this surging mass of men and animals at her feet, a sea of heads tossed and almost swept away in the whirlwind of the race as the line of jockeys flashed across the horizon. She’d watched the hindquarters of the horses as they tore away; they lengthened their stride, and as their legs disappeared into the distance they looked no thicker than a hair. Along the back-straight they could now be seen from the side, very small and delicate against the distant green of the Bois. Then suddenly they disappeared behind a big clump of trees planted in the middle of the racecourse."
"Nana n’eut pas l’air de comprendre. Elle souriait, elle regardait Rose, son mari et le banquier ; puis, elle dit à ce dernier :","Nana didn't seem to understand.

"Muffat demeurait devant la porte fermée, dans le foudroiement de ce qu’il venait de voir. Son frisson grandissait, un frisson qui lui montait des jambes dans la poitrine et dans le crâne. Puis, comme un arbre secoué par le grand vent, il chancela, il s’abattit sur les genoux, avec un craquement de tous les membres. Et, les mains désespérément tendues, il balbutia :","Muffat remained in front of the closed door, in the thunderstorm of what he had just seen. Her shiver grew, a shiver that rose from her legs to her chest and into her skull. Then, like a tree shaken by a strong wind, he staggered, he fell on his knees, with a crack in all his limbs. And, with desperately outstretched hands, he stammered:","Muffat stood in front of that closed door, utterly crushed by what he had just seen. His fit of trembling increased—a trembling which ascended from his legs to his chest and to his head.

And with hands despairingly outstretched he stammered:","Muffat stood in front of the closed door, paralysed by what he’d just seen. His legs started quivering more and more violently and the trembling spread upwards to his chest and head; like a tree shaken in a gale, he swayed and fell on his knees as his limbs gave way.

"C'était pour le marquis de Chouard que fleurissaient les roses d’or du bateau, des touffes de roses d’or épanouies dans des feuillages d’or, c’était pour lui que se penchaient les Amours, la ronde culbutée sur un treillis d’argent, avec des rires de gaminerie amoureuse ; et, à ses pieds, le Faune découvrait pour lui le sommeil de la nymphe lasse de volupté, cette figure de la Nuit copiée sur le nu célèbre de Nana, jusque dans les cuisses trop fortes, qui la faisaient reconnaître de tous. Jeté là comme une loque humaine, gâtée et dissoute par soixante ans de débauche, il mettait un coin de charnier dans la gloire des chairs éclatantes de la femme. Quand il avait vu la porte s’ouvrir, il s’était soulevé, pris de l’épouvante d’un vieillard gâteux ; cette dernière nuit d’amour le frappait d’imbécillité, il retombait en enfance ; et, ne trouvant plus les mots, à moitié paralysé, bégayant, grelottant, il restait dans une attitude de fuite, la chemise retroussée sur son corps de squelette, une jambe hors des couvertures, une pauvre jambe livide, couverte de poils gris. Nana, malgré sa contrariété, ne put s’empêcher de rire.","It was for the Marquis de Chouard that the boat's golden roses bloomed, tufts of golden roses blooming in golden leaves, it was for him that the Cupids leaned, the round one tumbling over a trellis silver, with laughter of amorous childishness; and, at his feet, the Faun discovered for him the sleep of the nymph weary of voluptuousness, that figure of Night copied from Nana's famous nude, right down to the overly strong thighs, which made her recognized by all. Thrown there like a human wreck, spoiled and dissolved by sixty years of debauchery, he placed a corner of the charnel ground in the glory of woman's dazzling flesh. When he had seen the door open, he had risen, seized with the terror of a doddering old man; this last night of love struck him with imbecility, he relapsed into childhood; and, unable to find the words, half paralyzed, stammering, shivering, he remained in an attitude of flight, his shirt rolled up over his skeleton body, one leg out of the blankets, a poor livid leg, covered with gray hair. Nana, despite her annoyance, couldn't help laughing.","It was for the Marquis de Chouard that the golden roses of the boat flowered—bunches of golden roses blooming amidst the golden foliage; it was for him that the cupids, dancing in a circle against the silver trellis, leant forward with a laugh of amorous sauciness; and it was for him that the faun at his feet uncovered the sleeping nymph, wearied with voluptuousness—that figure of Night, copied from Nana’s celebrated nudity, even to the too amply developed thighs, which would cause everyone to recognise her. Thrown there like a piece of human rubbish, corrupted and shattered by sixty years of debauchery, the marquis appeared as a corner of a charnel-house, surrounded by the glory of the woman’s dazzling flesh. When he saw the door open he raised himself up, seized with the fright of a paralytic old man. This last night of licentious-ness had smitten him with imbecility, he had fallen into his second childhood; and, no longer able to find his words—half paralysed, stuttering, shivering—he remained in an attitude of flight, his night-shirt rucked up over his skeleton of a body, one leg outside the clothes—a poor, livid leg covered with grey hairs. Nana, in spite of her annoyance, could not help laughing.","It was for the Marquis de Chouard, then, that the golden roses flourished on the side panels, those bunches of golden roses blooming among the golden leaves; it was for him that the Cupids leaned forth with amorous, roguish laughter from their tumbling ring on the silver trelliswork. And it was for him that the faun at his feet discovered the nymph sleeping, tired with dalliance, the figure of Night copied down to the exaggerated thighs--which caused her to be recognizable of all--from Nana's renowned nudity. Cast there like the rag of something human which has been spoiled and dissolved by sixty years of debauchery, he suggested the charnelhouse amid the glory of the woman's dazzling contours. Seeing the door open, he had risen up, smitten with sudden terror as became an infirm old man. This last night of passion had rendered him imbecile; he was entering on his second childhood; and, his speech failing him, he remained in an attitude of flight, half-paralyzed, stammering, shivering, his nightshirt half up his skeleton shape, and one leg outside the clothes, a livid leg, covered with gray hair. Despite her vexation Nana could not keep from laughing.","The golden roses of this elegantly curved bed, these bunches of golden roses blooming amongst the golden green foliage, were flourishing in honour of the Marquis de Chouard; it was in his honour that these Cupids, laughing like love-sick little boys, were bending forward from the bed-head and tumbling round on their silver lattice-work, while at his feet a Faun uncovered the figure of Night, a nymph asleep, exhausted by pleasure, copied from the famous nude statue of Nana, even in the detail of her over-fleshy thighs which made her instantly recognizable to all. A limp rag, rotten with decay from sixty years of debauchery, he looked like a death’s head at this feast celebrating Nana’s all-conquering flesh. On seeing the door open, he’d shot up, a terrified, senile old man; this last night of love-making had made him lose his wits, he was falling into second childhood; speechless and half-paralysed, he lay there babbling and shivering with his night-shirt rucked up round his skinny, cadaverous body, trying to escape, with one leg out of the blankets—a ghastly leg, purplish in colour and covered in grey hairs. Annoyed though she was, Nana couldn’t help laughing."
"Elle ne répondit pas, la face changée, tout d’un coup à son affaire. D’un rapide mouvement des épaules, elle avait fait glisser sa fourrure, que madame Jules, debout derrière elle, reçut dans ses bras. Et, nue, après avoir porté les deux mains à sa chevelure, comme pour l’assujettir, elle entra en scène.","She did not answer, her face changed, suddenly on her business. With a quick movement of her shoulders, she slid off her fur, which Madame Jules, standing behind her, received in her arms. And, naked, after having brought both hands to her hair, as if to subjugate it, she entered the scene.","She did not answer. Her face changed in a moment, and she was entirely occupied with her business. She rapidly let the fur cloak slip from off her shoulders, and Madame Jules, standing behind her, received it in her arms; and, after passing her hands over her hair as though to smooth it, she advanced on the stage in an almost nude state.","She did not answer; her whole expression altered; she was suddenly intent on her business. With a rapid movement of the shoulders she had let her furs slip from her, and Mme Jules, standing behind, had caught them in her arms. And then after passing her two hands to her hair as though to make it fast, she went on the stage in all her nudity.","She made no reply; her expression changed, the actress took over. Quickly slipping her fur off her shoulders into Madame Jules’s safe keeping as she stood waiting behind her, Nana raised her hands to her head, as though checking that her hair was properly in order and went on stage, naked."

"Alors, on le vit, aimable, souriant, aborder les hommes et causer aux quatre coins du salon. Il se mêlait aux groupes, glissait une phrase dans le cou de chacun, se retournait avec des clignements d’yeux et des signes d’intelligence. C'était comme un mot d’ordre qu’il distribuait, de son air aisé.

He mingled with the various groups, dropped a few words here and there, and then withdrew, winking his eyes and making other signs. It was as though he was, in his easy way, giving out a watchword. His words were passed from one to another, and appointments were made; whilst the ladies’ sentimental dissertations on music drowned the agitated buzz caused by all these alluring attempts.","With that he was observed to accost men and to engage them in conversation in his usual amiable and smiling way in every corner of the drawing room. He mixed with the various groups, said something confidently to everyone and walked away again with a sly wink and a secret signal or two. It looked as though he were giving out a watchword in that easy way of his. The news went round; the place of meeting was announced, while the ladies' sentimental dissertations on music served to conceal the small, feverish rumor of these recruiting operations.","Smiling affably, he went across to the men, chatting with them all round the room, murmuring a quick word or two over their shoulders before turning away with a wink and conspiratorial nod.

"Dans le corridor de droite, en effet, la porte de la loge se trouvait simplement poussée. Nana attendait. Cette petite Mathilde, un souillon 31 d’ingénue32, tenait sa loge très sale, avec une débandade de pots ébréchés, une toilette 33 grasse, une chaise tachée de rouge, comme si on avait saigné sur la paille. Le papier, collé aux murs et au plafond, était éclaboussé jusqu’en haut de gouttes d’eau savonneuse. Cela sentait si mauvais, un parfum de lavande tourné à l’aigre, que Nana ouvrit la fenêtre. Et elle resta accoudée une minute, respirant, se penchant pour voir, au-dessous, madame Bron, dont elle entendait le balai s’acharner sur les dalles verdies de l’étroite cour, enfoncée dans l’ombre. Un serin, accroché contre une persienne, jetait des roulades perçantes. On n’entendait point les voitures du boulevard ni des rues voisines, il y avait une paix de province, un large espace où le soleil dormait. En levant les yeux, elle apercevait les petits bâtiments et les vitrages luisants des galeries du passage, puis, au-delà, en face d’elle, les hautes maisons de la rue Vivienne, dont les façades de derrière se dressaient, muettes et comme vides. Des terrasses s’étageaient, un photographe avait perché sur un toit une grande cage en verre bleu. C'était très gai. Nana s’oubliait, lorsqu’il lui sembla qu’on avait frappé. Elle se tourna, elle cria :","In the corridor on the right, in fact, the door of the box was simply pushed open. Nana was waiting. This little Mathilde, a filthy 31 ingenue,32 kept her dressing room very dirty, with a swarm of chipped pots, a greasy toilet, a chair 33 stained red, as if someone had bled on the straw. The paper, stuck to the walls and ceiling, was spattered all the way up with drops of soapy water. It smelled so bad, a lavender scent turned sour, that Nana opened the window. And she remained leaning on her elbows for a minute, breathing, leaning forward to see, below, Madame Bron, whose broom she heard pounding on the green flagstones of the narrow courtyard, buried in the shade. A canary, hung against a shutter, cast piercing rolls. You couldn't hear the carriages on the boulevard or in the neighboring streets, there was a provincial peace, a wide space where the sun slept. Raising her eyes, she saw the small buildings and the gleaming windows of the galleries in the passage, then, beyond, opposite her, the tall houses in the rue Vivienne, whose rear facades stood up, mute and as if empty. Terraces were staged, a photographer had perched on a roof a large blue glass cage. It was very cheerful. Nana was forgetting herself when it seemed to her that someone had knocked. She turned, she cried:","In the passage on the right, the door of the dressing-room was, as Labordette had said, only pushed to. Nana was waiting there. That little slut of a Mathilde kept her dressing-room in a slovenly state; there were cracked pots scattered all about, a dirty wash-hand basin, and a chair stained with rouge, as though some one had been bleeding on the rush seat. The paper which covered the walls and the ceiling was splashed all over with soapy water. There was such a stench there, such a smell of lavender turned musty, that Nana opened the window. She stood there for a minute, breathing the fresh air, and leaning out to catch a glimpse of Madame Bron, whom she heard vigorously sweeping the green flagstones on the shady side of the narrow courtyard. A canary, in a cage hung up against a shutter, was uttering some piercing roulades. One could not hear the sounds of the vehicles on the Boulevard or in the neighbouring streets, all was as peaceful as in the country, though the sun but seldom penetrated there. On raising her eyes, Nana saw the little buildings and the shining glass roofs of the galleries of the Passage; then, farther off, in front of her, the high houses of the Rue Vivienne, the backs of which were so devoid of life that they seemed empty. Terraces rose one above another. On a roof a photographer had perched an enormous cage of blue glass. It looked very gay. Nana was becoming absorbed in contemplating the scene, when she thought she heard a knock at the door. She turned round and called out:","In the right-hand corridor the door of the dressing room had, indeed, not been closed entirely. Nana was waiting. That little Mathilde, a drab of a young girl, kept her dressing room in a filthy state. Chipped jugs stood about anyhow; the dressing table was greasy, and there was a chair covered with red stains, which looked as if someone had bled over the straw. The paper pasted on walls and ceiling was splashed from top to bottom with spots of soapy water and this smelled so disagreeably of lavender scent turned sour that Nana opened the window and for some moments stayed leaning on the sill, breathing the fresh air and craning forward to catch sight of Mme Bron underneath. She could hear her broom wildly at work on the mildewed pantiles of the narrow court which was buried in shadow. A canary, whose cage hung on a shutter, was trilling away piercingly. The sound of carriages in the boulevard and neighboring streets was no longer audible, and the quiet and the wide expanse of sleeping sunlight suggested the country. Looking farther afield, her eye fell on the small buildings and glass roofs of the galleries in the passage and, beyond these, on the tall houses in the Rue Vivienne, the backs of which rose silent and apparently deserted over against her. There was a succession of terrace roofs close by, and on one of these a photographer had perched a big cagelike construction of blue glass. It was all very gay, and Nana was becoming absorbed in contemplation, when it struck her someone had knocked at the door. She turned round and shouted:","The door of the dressing-room in the right-hand passage was, as Labordette had said, only pushed to. Nana was waiting. Mathilde, a little slut of a girl who favoured ingénue parts, kept her dressing-room in a revolting state, with a clutter of chipped pots and jars, a greasy wash-stand, and a chair with red stains that looked like blood on its rush seat. The paper on the walls and ceiling had been splashed up to the top with soapy water. There was such a foul smell, like lavender-water which had gone off, that Nana had opened the window, resting her elbows on the sill for a moment to breathe the outside air and leaning forward to look down at Madame Bron, who could be heard frantically brushing away at the slimy green flagstones of the courtyard shrouded in shadow. In a cage hanging from a shutter, a canary was producing high-pitched trills. Any sound of traffic from the neighbouring streets and boulevard was inaudible; it was a broad, spacious, countrified sort of feeling, under a drowsy sun. Raising her eyes she could see the low buildings and gleaming glass roofs of the arcade galleries, and beyond them, opposite, the tall backs of the houses in the Rue Vivienne, silent and empty-looking. There were tiers of roof-terraces; on one, a photographer had perched a large blue glass cage. It was a very cheerful scene, and Nana was lost in contemplation of it when suddenly she thought she heard a knock on the door. She turned round and called:"
"Le petit, sans parler, se laissa essuyer les mains. La jeune femme avait pris son mouchoir. Elle tamponna ensuite Bijou, qui tremblait plus fort. Ce ne serait rien, quelques taches sur le satin blanc de sa toilette ; mais elle s’en fichait. Les bouquets, rafraîchis, avaient un éclat de neige ; et elle en respirait un, heureuse, mouillant ses lèvres comme dans de la rosée.","The little one, without speaking, let his hands be wiped. The young woman had taken her handkerchief. She then dabbed Bijou, who was shaking harder. It would be nothing, a few stains on the white satin of her toilette; but she didn't care. The bouquets, refreshed, had a sheen of snow; and she inhaled one, happy, wetting her lips as in dew.","The child, without a word, let her wipe his hands with her pocket-handkerchief.

The young woman had taken out her handkerchief. Then she dabbed it over Bijou, who was trembling more violently than ever. It would not matter in the least; there were a few drops on the white satin of her dress, but she didn't care a pin for them. The bouquets, refreshed by the rain, glowed like snow, and she smelled one ecstatically, drenching her lips in it as though it were wet with dew.","Without a word the little boy let Nana wipe his hands on her handkerchief. Then she dabbed Bijou, who was trembling more than ever. It wasn’t serious, a few spots on her white satin dress but she didn’t mind.

"La pièce s’acheva. Aux appels triomphants de Vulcain, tout l’Olympe défilait devant les amoureux, avec des oh ! et des ah ! de stupéfaction et de gaillardise. Jupiter disait : « Mon fils106, je vous trouve léger de nous appeler pour voir ça. » Puis, un revirement avait lieu en faveur de Vénus. Le chœur des cocus, introduit de nouveau par Iris, suppliait le maître des dieux de ne pas donner suite à sa requête ; depuis que les femmes demeuraient au logis, la vie y devenait impossible pour les hommes ; ils aimaient mieux être trompés et contents, ce qui était la morale de la comédie. Alors, on délivrait Vénus. Vulcain obtenait une séparation de corps. Mars se remettait avec Diane. Jupiter, pour avoir la paix dans son ménage, envoyait sa petite blanchisseuse dans une constellation. Et l’on tirait enfin l’Amour de son cachot, où il avait fait des cocottes107, au lieu de conjuguer le verbe aimer. La toile tomba sur une apothéose108, le chœur des cocus agenouillé, chantant un hymne de reconnaissance à Vénus, souriante et grandie dans sa souveraine nudité109.","The play ended. At the triumphant calls of Vulcan, all of Olympus paraded before the lovers, with ohs! and ah! of amazement and jubilation. Jupiter said: ""My son106, I think it's a shame for you to call us to see this."" Then, a reversal took place in favor of Venus. The chorus of cuckolds, introduced again by Iris, begged the master of the gods not to comply with his request; since the women had been living in the house, life there became impossible for the men; they preferred to be deceived and pleased, which was the moral of comedy. So we delivered Venus. Vulcan obtained a legal separation. Mars was getting back together with Diane. Jupiter, to have peace in his household, sent his little laundress to a constellation. And they finally dragged Love out of his dungeon, where he had made cocottes107, instead of conjugating the verb to love. The canvas fell on an apotheosis108, the choir of cuckolds kneeling, singing a hymn of gratitude to Venus, smiling and growing in her sovereign nudity109.","The play was rapidly drawing to an end. In answer to Vulcan’s triumphant calls, all Olympus defiled before the lovers, uttering cries of stupefaction or indulging in broad remarks. Jupiter said, “My son, I consider you are very foolish to call us to see this.” Then there was a sudden change of feeling in favour of Venus. The deputation of cuckolds, again introduced by Iris, beseeched the master of the gods not to give heed to their petition, for since their wives passed their evenings at home they made their lives unbearable, so they preferred to be deceived and happy, which was the moral of the piece. Venus, therefore, was set free. Vulcan obtained a judicial separation. Mars made it up again with Diana. Jupiter, for the sake of peace and quietness at home, sent the little washerwoman into a constellation; and Cupid was at last released from his prison, where he had been making paper fowls, instead of conjugating the verb “to love.” The curtain fell on an apotheosis, the deputation of cuckolds kneeling and singing a hymn of gratitude to Venus, smiling and exalted in her sovereign nudity.","The piece drew to a close. In answer to Vulcan's triumphant summons all the Olympians defiled before the lovers with ohs and ahs of stupefaction and gaiety. Jupiter said, ""I think it is light conduct on your part, my son, to summon us to see such a sight as this."" Then a reaction took place in favor of Venus. The chorus of cuckolds was again ushered in by Iris and besought the master of the gods not to give effect to its petition, for since women had lived at home, domestic life was becoming impossible for the men: the latter preferred being deceived and happy. That was the moral of the play. Then Venus was set at liberty, and Vulcan obtained a partial divorce from her. Mars was reconciled with Diana, and Jove, for the sake of domestic peace, packed his little laundress off into a constellation. And finally they extricated Love from his black hole, where instead of conjugating the verb AMO he had been busy in the manufacture of ""dollies. "" The curtain fell on an apotheosis, wherein the cuckolds' chorus knelt and sang a hymn of gratitude to Venus, who stood there with smiling lips, her stature enhanced by her sovereign nudity.","The operetta was drawing to an end. In response to Vulcan’s triumphant call, the whole of Olympus paraded in front of the lovers, with many ‘ohs’ and ‘ahs’, full of amazement and suggestive undertones. Jupiter was heard to say: ‘My son, I consider it frivolous of you to invite us to come and look at this!’ Then there was a swing in favour of Venus. The chorus of cuckolds, once again introduced by Iris, beseeched the master of the gods not to accede to their request; now that their wives were at home all the time, life was becoming impossible for them; they preferred to be happy cuckolds; this was the moral of the comedy. So Venus was set free, Vulcan was granted a separation, and Mars went back to Diana. In order to have some peace at home, Jupiter sent his little laundress off into a constellation. And Cupid was finally let out of his dungeon, where instead of conjugating the verb to love he’d been making paper hats. The curtain fell on an apotheosis, with the chorus of cuckolds on their knees singing a hymn of praise to Venus, smiling and more splendid than ever in her captivating nakedness."
"« Eh bien, que pensez-vous de la débutante ?... On la traite assez mal dans les couloirs.","“Well, what do you think of the debutante?... They treat her pretty badly in the corridors.","Then Fauchery, so as to embarrass him, said, “And the new star, what do you think of her? The remarks I have heard made about the house are rather disparaging.”","""Well, well! What's your opinion of the new actress? She's being roughly handled enough in the passages.""","‘Well, what do you think of our new star? … People don’t seem all that enthusiastic, to judge by what I heard in the corridor.’"

"" D'you see Nana coming in over there?""","‘Ah, this time it really is her!’ shouted la Faloise who could never let a joke rest once he’d made up his mind that it was a good one. ‘ Look over there!

Oh, that's unbearable!""","‘What’s that?’ Madame Du Joncquoy was screeching. ‘What are you saying? You think Bismarck is going to make war on us and win? Oh, that’s really rich!’"
"Personne ne l’avait vendue, Nana était sauvée. Elle rentra à tâtons dans la chambre, grelottante, morte de peur. Ses pieds nus saignaient, déchirés par le grillage. Longtemps, elle resta assise au bord du lit, écoutant toujours. Vers le matin, pourtant, elle s’endormit. Mais, à huit heures, lorsqu’elle s’éveilla, elle se sauva de l’hôtel et courut chez sa tante. Quand madame Lerat, qui justement prenait son café au lait avec Zoé, l’aperçut à cette heure, faite comme une souillon, la figure renversée, elle comprit tout de suite.","No one had sold her, Nana was saved. She groped her way into the bedroom, shivering, scared to death. His bare feet were bleeding, torn by the wire mesh. For a long time she sat on the edge of the bed, still listening.

When Madame Lerat, who happened to be having her café au lait with Zoé, saw her at that hour, made like a slut, her face thrown back, she understood at once.","No one had betrayed her. Nana was saved. She crept back into the room, shivering and almost dead with fright. Her bare feet were bleeding from the scratches caused by the wire. For a long while she remained, listening, seated on the edge of the bed. Towards morning, however, she fell asleep; but at eight o’clock, when she awoke, she quickly left the house, and hastened to her aunt’s. When Madame Lerat, who happened to be just taking her breakfast with Zoé, saw her at that early hour, dressed in such a slovenly way, and with a scared look about her face, she understood it at once.","Nobody had betrayed her; Nana was saved. Shivering and half dead with fear, she came groping back into the room. Her bare feet were cut and bleeding, for they had been torn by the grating.

Toward morning, however, she went to sleep again, and at eight o'clock, when she woke up, she escaped from the hotel and ran to her aunt's.

Madame Lerat happened to be taking her breakfast cup of coffee with Zoé, and when she saw her at this early hour of the morning, looking so bedraggled and distraught, she realized immediately what had happened."

"Dès lors, Nana eut une passion, qui l’occupa. Satin fut son vice. Installée dans l’hôtel de l’avenue de Villiers, débarbouillée, nippée, pendant trois jours elle raconta Saint-Lazare, et les embêtements avec les sœurs, et ces salauds de la police qui l’avaient mise en carte. Nana s’indignait, la consolait, jurait de la tirer de là, quand elle devrait elle-même aller trouver le ministre. En attendant, rien ne pressait, on ne viendrait pas la chercher chez elle, bien sûr. Et des après-midi de tendresse commencèrent entre les deux femmes, des mots caressants, des baisers coupés de rires. C'était le petit jeu interrompu par l’arrivée des agents, rue de Laval, qui reprenait, sur un ton de plaisanterie. Puis, un beau soir, ça devint sérieux. Nana, si dégoûtée chez Laure, comprenait maintenant. Elle en fut bouleversée, enragée ; d’autant plus que, justement, le matin du quatrième jour, Satin disparut. Personne ne l’avait vue sortir. Elle avait filé, avec sa robe neuve, prise d’un besoin d’air, ayant la nostalgie de son trottoir.","From then on, Nana had a passion, which occupied her. Satin was his vice. Installed in the hotel on the avenue de Villiers, washed and dressed, for three days she talked about Saint-Lazare, and the hassles with the sisters, and those bastards of the police who had put her on the map. Nana was indignant, consoled her, swore to get her out of there, when she had to go find the minister herself. In the meantime, there was no hurry, we wouldn't come looking for her at home, of course. And afternoons of tenderness began between the two women, caressing words, kisses punctuated by laughter. It was the little game interrupted by the arrival of the agents, rue de Laval, which resumed, in a joking tone. Then, one evening, it got serious. Nana, so disgusted with Laure, understood now. She was upset, enraged; especially since, precisely, on the morning of the fourth day, Satin disappeared. No one had seen her leave. She had run away, with her new dress, seized with a need for air, longing for her sidewalk.","From that time Nana had a passion which occupied her. Satin became her vice. Installed in the mansion of the Avenue de Villiers, cleaned and clothed, for three days she gave her experiences of Saint-Lazare—all the troubles she had had with the nuns, and those dirty policemen who had put her on their list. Nana became very indignant, consoled her, and swore to get her out of the mess, even though she had to see the minister of police herself. For the moment, however, there was no hurry; they would certainly not come and seek her there. And afternoons full of tenderness commenced between the two women—caressing words were heard, and kisses broken with suppressed laughter. It was the little game, interrupted by the arrival of the policemen at the Rue de Laval, which had started again in the way of joke. Then one night it became serious. Nana, who was so disgusted at Laure’s, now began to understand. She was quite upset and greatly enraged; the more so as, on the morning of the fourth day, Satin disappeared. No one had seen her go out. She had bolted with her new dress, seized with a longing for the open air, with a nostalgia for her favourite pavements.","From that day forth Nana had a passion to occupy her thoughts. Satin became her vicious foible. Washed and dressed and duly installed in the house in the Avenue de Villiers, during three days the girl talked of Saint-Lazare and the annoyances the sisters had caused her and how those dirty police people had put her down on the official list. Nana grew indignant and comforted her and vowed she would get her name taken off, even though she herself should have to go and find out the minister of the interior. Meanwhile there was no sort of hurry: nobody would come and search for her at Nana's-- that was certain. And thereupon the two women began to pass tender afternoons together, making numberless endearing little speeches and mingling their kisses with laughter. The same little sport, which the arrival of the plainclothes men had interrupted in the Rue de Laval, was beginning again in a jocular sort of spirit. One fine evening, however, it became serious, and Nana, who had been so disgusted at Laure's, now understood what it meant. She was upset and enraged by it, the more so because Satin disappeared on the morning of the fourth day. No one had seen her go our. She had, indeed, slipped away in her new dress, seized by a longing for air, full of sentimental regret for her old street existence.","From then on, Nana had an absorbing passion: Satin became her vice. She took her into her house in the Avenue de Villiers, cleaned her up, got her decent clothes, and for three whole days Satin told her all about Saint-Lazare, her troubles with the hospital sisters, and the pigs of policemen who made her register as a public prostitute. Nana was indignant, comforted her, and promised faithfully to get her out of that situation even if she had to go and see the minister herself. Meanwhile there was no urgency, no one would look for her here, that was for sure. The two women started spending their afternoons together, cuddling and kissing and generally billing and cooing, interspersed with giggles. It was the same little game they’d been playing in the Rue de Laval on the night the police burst in on them. Then one evening it turned into something earnest … Nana, who’d been revolted at Laure’s, now realized what it was all about; she was ecstatic and devastated, the more so as, on the morning of the fourth day, Satin vanished. Nobody had seen her leave. She’d felt nostalgic for her life on the streets, she needed a change of air, so she’d slipped away, wearing her new dress."
"Mais, à partir de cette soirée, la vie entre eux devint de plus en plus difficile. D’un bout de la semaine à l’autre, il y avait un bruit de gifles, un vrai tic-tac d’horloge, qui semblait régler leur existence. Nana, à force d’être battue47, prenait une souplesse de linge fin ; et ça la rendait délicate de peau, rose et blanche de teint, si douce au toucher, si claire à l’œil, qu’elle avait encore embelli. Aussi Prullière s’enrageait-il après ses jupes, venant lorsque Fontan n’était pas là, la poussant dans les coins pour l’embrasser. Mais elle se débattait, indignée tout de suite, avec des rougeurs de honte ; elle trouvait dégoûtant qu’il voulût tromper un ami. Alors, Prullière ricanait d’un air vexé. Vrai, elle devenait joliment bête ! Comment pouvait-elle s’attacher à un pareil singe ? car, enfin, Fontan était un vrai singe, avec son grand nez toujours en branle48. Une sale tête ! Et un homme qui l’assommait encore !","But, from that evening, life between them became more and more difficult. From one end of the week to the other, there was a sound of slapping, a real clock ticking, which seemed to regulate their existence. Nana, from being beaten,47 took on the suppleness of fine linen; and it made her skin delicate, rosy and white in complexion, so soft to the touch, so clear to the eye, that she looked even more beautiful. So Prullière was enraged after her petticoats, coming when Fontan was not there, pushing her into the corners to kiss her. But she struggled, instantly indignant, blushing with shame; she found it disgusting that he wanted to deceive a friend. Then Prullière chuckled with an vexed air. True, she was becoming pretty stupid! How could she get attached to such a monkey? for, after all, Fontan was a real monkey, with his big nose always in motion. A dirty head! And a man who knocked him out again!","But from that evening their life together became worse than ever. From one end of the week to the other the sound of slaps could be heard, just like the tick-tick of a pendulum which seemed to regulate their existence. Nana, through being beaten so frequently, became as supple as fine linen; and it made her skin so delicate, and so soft to the touch—her complexion so pink and white, so clear to the eye—that she was more beautiful than ever. And that was why Prullière was for ever dangling about her skirts, calling when he knew Fontan would not be there, and pushing her into corners and trying to kiss her; but she, at once becoming highly indignant, struggled and blushed with shame. She thought it disgusting of him to wish to deceive his friend. Then Prullière sneered with vexation. Really, she was becoming precious stupid! How could she stick to such a monkey? for Fontan was indeed a monkey, with his big nose for ever on the move—a disgusting pig! and a fellow, too, who was always knocking her about!","But from that evening onward their life in common became more and more difficult. From one week's end to the other the noise of slaps filled the air and resembled the ticking of a clock by which they regulated their existence. Through dint of being much beaten Nana became as pliable as fine linen; her skin grew delicate and pink and white and so soft to the touch and clear to the view that she may be said to have grown more good looking than ever. Prulliere, moreover, began running after her like a madman, coming in when Fontan was away and pushing her into corners in order to snatch an embrace. But she used to struggle out of his grasp, full of indignation and blushing with shame. It disgusted her to think of him wanting to deceive a friend. Prulliere would thereupon begin sneering with a wrathful expression. Why, she was growing jolly stupid nowadays! How could she take up with such an ape? For, indeed, Fontan was a regular ape with that great swingeing nose of his. Oh, he had an ugly mug! Besides, the man knocked her about too!","But after that evening, their life together grew increasingly stormy. From one week’s end to the next, there was a constant sound of slaps, regulating their lives like the ticking of a clock. Nana got so many thrashings that she became as soft as fine linen, her skin delicate, her complexion pure peaches-and-cream, so tender to the touch and so radiant that she looked even lovelier. As a result, Prullière was always after her, calling when Fontan wasn’t at home and pushing her into corners to steal a kiss. She would immediately start struggling, blushing with shame and indignation; she thought it was disgusting to try to betray a friend. Prullière would get annoyed and sneer: what a silly little girl she was turning into! How could she feel attached to such a monkey of a man! After all, Fontan really was like a monkey, with his huge twitching snout. What an ugly mug he’d got! And he kept beating her up, too!"

In theater slang, a show that does not work: as, for lack of spectators, the candles were extinguished, it was “dark as in an oven”.","But Bordenave, his rage getting the better of him, indicated, with a rapid movement of his chin, the crowd that filled the vestibule—that mob of men with parched mouths and sparkling eyes, still inflamed with their passionate longing for Nana—and violently exclaimed:—","The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop--to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze.",and Nana was still asleep.

"Elle refusa, c’était inutile. Deux jours auparavant elle avait tiré cinq mille francs du comte. Cependant, elle regretta sa discrétion. Derrière Labordette, bien qu’il fût à peine deux heures et demie, le boulanger reparut ; et il s’installa sur une banquette du vestibule, brutalement, en jurant très haut. La jeune femme l’écoutait du premier étage. Elle pâlissait, elle souffrait surtout d’entendre grandir jusqu’à elle la joie sourde des domestiques. On crevait de rire dans la cuisine ; le cocher regardait du fond de la cour, François traversait sans raison le vestibule, puis se hâtait d’aller donner des nouvelles, après avoir jeté au boulanger un ricanement d’intelligence. On se fichait de madame, les murs éclataient, elle se sentait toute seule dans le mépris de l’office 25 qui la guettait et l’éclaboussait d’une blague ordurière. Alors, comme elle avait eu l’idée d’emprunter les cent trente-trois francs à Zoé, elle l’abandonna ; elle lui devait déjà de l’argent, elle était trop fière pour risquer un refus. Une telle émotion la soulevait, qu’elle rentra dans sa chambre, en parlant tout haut.","She refused, it was useless. Two days previously she had drawn five thousand francs from the count. However, she regretted her discretion. Behind Labordette, although it was barely half-past two, the baker reappeared; and he sat down abruptly on a bench in the vestibule, swearing very loudly. The young woman listened to him from the first floor. She grew pale, she suffered above all from hearing the dull joy of the servants rise up to her. We were bursting with laughter in the kitchen; the coachman watched from the back of the yard, François crossed the vestibule for no reason, then hastened to give the news, after giving the baker a knowing sneer. They didn't care about Madame, the walls were bursting, she felt all alone in contempt for the office that watched her and splashed her with a filthy joke. Then, as she had had the idea of borrowing the hundred and thirty-three francs from Zoé, she abandoned him; she already owed him money, she was too proud to risk a refusal. Such emotion overwhelmed her that she returned to her room, speaking aloud.","She refused; it was useless. Two days before she had got five thousand francs out of the count. Following Labordette, though it was scarcely half-past two when he called, the baker reappeared; and he roughly seated himself on a bench in the hall, swearing very loud. The young woman was listening to him up on the first floor. She turned pale; she suffered especially at hearing up there the secret joy of the servants. They were splitting their sides with laughing in the kitchen. The coachman looked on from the yard; François passed across the hall without any necessity, and then went and told the others how things were progressing, after bestowing a chuckle of intelligence on the baker. They did not care a straw for madame; the walls seemed bursting with the sounds of their mirth. She felt herself all alone, despised by her servants, who spied on her and bespattered her with their filthy jokes. Then as she had had an idea of borrowing the hundred and thirty-three francs from Zoé, she gave it up. She already owed her some money; she was too proud to risk a refusal. So strong an emotion possessed her that she returned to her bed-room, saying aloud,","She refused; it was useless. Two days before she had succeeded in getting five thousand francs out of the count. However, she soon regretted her discreet conduct, for the moment Labordette had gone the baker reappeared, though it was barely half-past two, and with many loud oaths roughly settled himself on a bench in the hall. The young woman listened to him from the first floor. She was pale, and it caused her especial pain to hear the servants' secret rejoicings swelling up louder and louder till they even reached her ears. Down in the kitchen they were dying of laughter. The coachman was staring across from the other side of the court; Francois was crossing the hall without any apparent reason. Then he hurried off to report progress, after sneering knowingly at the baker. They didn't care a damn for Madame; the walls were echoing to their laughter, and she felt that she was deserted on all hands and despised by the servants' hall, the inmates of which were watching her every movement and liberally bespattering her with the filthiest of chaff. Thereupon she abandoned the intention of borrowing the hundred and thirty-three francs from Zoe; she already owed the maid money, and she was too proud to risk a refusal now. Such a burst of feeling stirred her that she went back into her room, loudly remarking:","She said no, there was no point, she’d squeezed five thousand francs out of the count only two days ago. However, she soon regretted her qualms, for although it was barely half-past two, hard on Labordette’s heels the baker made his reappearance, swearing loudly, and unceremoniously sat down on a bench in the front hall. The young woman could hear him from the first floor. She went pale, particularly when she heard the servants voicing their secret delight at her predicament more and more openly. In the kitchen they were splitting their sides with laughter; outside, the coachman was looking in from the yard, while François for no apparent reason went through the hall and hurried back to pass on the latest news, throwing the baker a conspiratorial grin. They were all jeering at their mistress, and the uproar they were making was echoing through the whole house. Their loathing for her, their spying on her, and their filthy jokes at her expense made Nana feel completely isolated. She dropped the idea which had momentarily crossed her mind of trying to borrow the hundred and thirty-three francs from Zoé; she already owed her money and was too proud to want to risk being refused. As she went back into her bedroom she was in such a state of emotion that she was talking to herself:"

"Nana, cependant, en voyant rire la salle, s’était mise à rire. La gaieté redoubla. Elle était drôle tout de même, cette belle fille. Son rire lui creusait un amour de petit trou dans le menton. Elle attendait, pas gênée, familière, entrant tout de suite de plain-pied avec le public, ayant l’air de dire elle-même d’un clignement d’yeux qu’elle n’avait pas de talent pour deux liards55, mais que ça ne faisait rien, qu’elle avait autre chose. Et, après avoir adressé au chef d’orchestre un geste qui signifiait : « Allons-y, mon bonhomme ! », elle commença le second couplet :","Nana, however, seeing the audience laughing, began to laugh. The gaiety redoubled. She was funny all the same, this beautiful girl. His laughter dug a little love hole in his chin. She was waiting, not embarrassed, familiar, entering right away on a level with the public, seeming to say herself with a blink of an eye that she had no talent for two farthings, but that it didn't matter, that she had something else.

And after making a sign to the conductor, which meant, “Off you go, old boy!” she commenced her second verse:","Nana, in the meantime, seeing the house laughing, began to laugh herself. The gaiety of all redoubled itself. She was an amusing creature, all the same, was that fine girl! Her laughter made a love of a little dimple appear in her chin. She stood there waiting, not bored in the least, familiar with her audience, falling into step with them at once, as though she herself were admitting with a wink that she had not two farthings' worth of talent but that it did not matter at all, that, in fact, she had other good points. And then after having made a sign to the conductor which plainly signified, ""Go ahead, old boy!"" she began her second verse:","Seeing the audience laughing, Nana had begun to laugh herself.

Des duchesses se la montraient d’un regard, des bourgeoises enrichies copiaient ses chapeaux ; parfois son landau, pour passer, arrêtait une file de puissants équipages, des financiers tenant l’Europe dans leur caisse, des ministres dont les gros doigts serraient la France à la gorge ; et elle était de ce monde du Bois, elle y prenait une place considérable, connue de toutes les capitales, demandée par tous les étrangers, ajoutant aux splendeurs de cette foule le coup de folie de sa débauche, comme la gloire même et la jouissance aiguë d’une nation. Puis, les liaisons de nuit, des passades continuelles dont elle-même chaque matin perdait le souvenir, la promenaient dans les grands restaurants, souvent au Madrid38, par les beaux jours. Le personnel des ambassades défilait, elle dînait avec Lucy Stewart, Caroline Héquet, Maria Blond, en compagnie de messieurs écorchant le français, payant pour être amusés, les prenant à la soirée avec ordre d’être drôles, si blasés et si vides, qu’ils ne les touchaient même pas. Et elles appelaient ça « aller à la rigolade », elles rentraient, heureuses de leurs dédains, finir la nuit aux bras de quelque amant de cœur.","At this hour, she was no longer bothered, she had regained complete freedom. Every day she made her rounds of the lake35, sketching out knowledge there, which was unraveling elsewhere. It was the big repair, the parsley 36 in the clear sun, the hanging up of illustrious whores, spread out in the smile of tolerance 37 and in the dazzling luxury of Paris. Duchesses glanced at her, wealthy bourgeoises copied her hats; sometimes his landau, in order to pass, stopped a file of powerful carriages, financiers holding Europe in their boxes, ministers whose big fingers clutched France by the throat; and she was from this world of the Bois, she took a considerable place there, known to all the capitals, demanded by all foreigners, adding to the splendours of this crowd the stroke of madness of her debauchery, like the very glory and the acute enjoyment of a nation. Then, the night liaisons, continual passages of which she herself lost the memory each morning, took her out to the great restaurants, often to the Madrid38, on fine days. Embassy personnel paraded, she dined with Lucy Stewart, Caroline Héquet, Maria Blond, in the company of gentlemen scratching their French, paying to be amused, taking them to the party with orders to be funny, so jaded and so empty, that they didn't even touch them. And they called it ""joking around"", they went home, happy with their disdain, to end the night in the arms of some lover at heart.","She no longer put the least constraint upon herself now, she had regained complete liberty. Every day she took her drive in the Bois round the lake, forming acquaintances there which became more intimate elsewhere. It was the great angling match for men, the baiting in the full light of day, the hooking by illustrious harlots, beneath the smile of toleration and the dazzling luxury of Paris. Duchesses drew each other’s attention to her, the wives of wealthy tradesmen copied her bonnets; at times her landau, when striving to pass, would arrest a long string of grand equipages, containing financiers holding all Europe in their cash-boxes, and ministers whose big fingers were half throttling France; and she formed a part of this world of the Bois. She occupied an important position there, known by the people of every capital, greatly in demand with all foreigners, adding the mad fit of her debauchery to the splendours of that crowd like the very glory and keen enjoyment of a nation. Then the intimacies of a night—mere birds of passage, of which she herself lost all recollection on the morrow—would take her to the grand restaurants, often to the Café de Madrid, when the weather was fine. All the staff of the embassies defiled there; she dined with Lucy Stewart, who murdered the French language, and who paid to be amused, taking the girls at so much an evening, with instructions to them to be funny, while they themselves were so sick of everything and so worn out that they never even touched them. And the girls called it going on the spree. They returned home delighted at having been treated with such disdain, and finished the night with some lover of their choice.","Nowadays she no longer minded her ps and qs; she had regained the most perfect freedom. Every day she did her round of the lake, beginning acquaintanceships which ended elsewhere. Here was the happy hunting ground par excellence, where courtesans of the first water spread their nets in open daylight and flaunted themselves amid the tolerating smiles and brilliant luxury of Paris. Duchesses pointed her out to one another with a passing look--rich shopkeepers' wives copied the fashion of her hats. Sometimes her landau, in its haste to get by, stopped a file of puissant turnouts, wherein sat plutocrats able to buy up all Europe or Cabinet ministers with plump fingers tight-pressed to the throat of France. She belonged to this Bois society, occupied a prominent place in it, was known in every capital and asked about by every foreigner. The splendors of this crowd were enhanced by the madness of her profligacy as though it were the very crown, the darling passion, of the nation. Then there were unions of a night, continual passages of desire, which she lost count of the morning after, and these sent her touring through the grand restaurants and on fine days, as often as not, to ""Madrid. "" The staffs of all the embassies visited her, and she, Lucy Stewart, Caroline Hequet and Maria Blond would dine in the society of gentlemen who murdered the French language and paid to be amused, engaging them by the evening with orders to be funny and yet proving so blase and so worn out that they never even touched them. This the ladies called ""going on a spree,"" and they would return home happy at having been despised and would finish the night in the arms of the lovers of their choice.","By now, she’d completely broken free and abandoned any sort of restraint. Every day she would drive round the lake in the Bois, picking up men whom she then got to know far more intimately elsewhere later on. It was hustling on a grand scale, soliciting alfresco, accosting by the most notable Paris tarts, who flaunted their charms amid the glitter and luxury and under the tolerant smiles of the cream of smart society. Duchesses would point her out to each other with a nod, upstart middle-class wives copied her hats; sometimes as her landau drove by it would hold up a queue of prestigious carriages, bankers whose money-bags controlled the finances of Europe, ministers whose thick fingers held France in a strangle-hold; and Nana was one of this smart Bois de Boulogne set and held a place of honour in it ; she was known in every capital, every visiting foreigner asked to meet her; her orgies and wild escapades added lustre to this brilliant crowd; she was its crowning glory, the epitome of a nation’s keenest pleasures. Then there were her one-night stands, an endless series of short-lived affairs which she herself couldn’t remember the following morning, visits to the smartest restaurants, often the Madrid* when the weather was fine. The diplomatic corps queued up for her, she would dine with Lucy Stewart, Caroline Héquet, and Maria Blond in the company of men who murdered the French language and were paying to be amused, booking them for the evening merely for that purpose, since they were so world-weary and empty-headed that they didn’t even touch them. And the girls described it as ‘going out for a laugh’ and went home glad to have cold-shouldered them and finished the night in the arms of one of their fancy men."
"« Ça, c’est bien vrai, ils sont gentils, disait Nana, restée par terre à changer de chemise. Seulement, tu sais, ils voient qui je suis... Un mot, et je te les flanquerais à la porte ! »","""That's very true, they're nice,"" said Nana, who had remained on the ground changing her shirt. Only, you know, they see who I am... One word, and I'll kick them out! »","“That’s true, they’re all very nice,” said Nana, still seated on the ground and changing her chemise. “Only, you know, they see who I am. Should they for a moment forget themselves, I would have them turned out of the house at once!”","""It's very true; they're nice,"" Nana would say as she lingered on the floor to change her shift. "" Only, you know, they see what I am. One word about it and I should chuck 'em all out of doors for you!""","‘You’re quite right, they’re very nice’, agreed Nana, still on the floor, now putting on her night-gown. ‘But you know, they realize who I am. One word and they’ll be out on their necks!’"
"Alors, comme il était au bord du lit, elle l’empoigna de ses bras nus, secouée d’un beau rire, et pleurant presque, tant elle trouvait ça gentil de sa part.","Then, as he was on the edge of the bed, she grabbed him with her bare arms, shaking with a lovely laugh, and almost crying, she thought that was so nice of him.","Then, as he was close to the bed, she seized hold of him with her bare arms, shaking with laughter and, almost weeping, for she thought it so nice of him.","And with that, as he was now by the bedside, she caught him in her bare arms and shook with merry laughter and almost cried, she thought it so pretty of him.","At this, seeing him standing beside the bed, she reached out and grasped him in her naked arms, laughing out loud and almost in tears: wasn’t that really sweet of him!"
"Il la voyait dans une fosse, avec le décharnement d’un siècle de sommeil ; et ses mains s’étaient jointes, il bégayait une prière. Depuis quelque temps, la religion l’avait reconquis ; ses crises de foi, chaque jour, reprenaient cette violence de coups de sang, qui le laissaient comme assommé. Les doigts de ses mains craquaient, il répétait ces seuls mots, continuellement : « Mon Dieu... Mon Dieu... Mon Dieu. » C'était le cri de son impuissance, le cri de son péché, contre lequel il restait sans force, malgré la certitude de sa damnation. Quand elle revint, elle le trouva sous la couverture, hagard, les ongles dans la poitrine, les yeux en l’air comme pour chercher le ciel ! Et elle se mit à pleurer, tous deux s’embrassèrent, claquant des dents sans savoir pourquoi, roulant au fond de la même obsession imbécile. Ils avaient déjà passé une nuit semblable ; seulement, cette fois, c’était complètement idiot, ainsi que Nana le déclara, lorsqu’elle n’eut plus peur. Un soupçon lui fit interroger le comte avec prudence : peut-être Rose Mignon avait-elle envoyé la fameuse lettre ? Mais ce n’était pas ça, c’était le trac, pas davantage, car il ignorait encore son cocuage.","He saw her in a pit, with the emaciation of a century of sleep; and his hands had joined, he was stammering a prayer. For some time past religion had reconquered him; his crises of faith, each day, resumed this violence of strokes of blood, which left him as if stunned. The fingers of his hands cracked, he repeated these single words, continually: ""My God... My God... My God."" It was the cry of his impotence, the cry of his sin, against which he remained powerless, despite the certainty of his damnation. When she came back, she found him under the blanket, haggard, nails in his chest, eyes raised as if to seek the sky! And she began to cry, the two kissed each other, chattering their teeth without knowing why, rolling in the depths of the same imbecile obsession. They had spent a similar night before; only this time it was completely silly, as Nana said, when she was no longer afraid. A suspicion made him question the Count cautiously: perhaps Rose Mignon had sent the famous letter? But it was not that, it was stage fright, no more, because he was still unaware of his cuckoldry.","He could picture her in a grave, with the emaciation of a century; and, joining his hands, he muttered a prayer. For some time past religion had regained possession of him, his attacks of faith, every day, had the violence of apoplectic fits, and left him without the least strength. His fingers snapped, and he continually repeated these words: “My God—my God—my God.” It was the cry of his impotence, the cry of his sin, against which he was powerless to resist, in spite of the certainty of his damnation. When Nana returned to the bed she found him lying under the clothes with a haggard look on his face, his nails digging into his chest, and his eyes gazing upwards as though seeking for heaven. And she burst out crying again; they embraced each other, their teeth chattering without their knowing it, both being oppressed by the same absurd nightmare. They had once before passed a similar night, only this time they were utterly idiotic, as Nana herself declared when she had got over her fright. A suspicion caused her to skilfully question the count; perhaps Rose Mignon had sent the famous letter. But it wasn’t that, it was merely his nerves, nothing more, for he was still without proofs of his cuckoldom.","He fancied he saw her in a grave, emaciated by a century of sleep, and he joined his hands and stammered a prayer. It was some time ago that the religious sense had reconquered him, and now his daily access of faith had again assumed the apoplectic intensity which was wont to leave him well-nigh stunned. The joints of his fingers used to crack, and he would repeat without cease these words only: ""My God, my God, my God!"" It was the cry of his impotence, the cry of that sin against which, though his damnation was certain, he felt powerless to strive. When Nana returned she found him hidden beneath the bedclothes; he was haggard; he had dug his nails into his bosom, and his eyes stared upward as though in search of heaven. And with that she started to weep again. Then they both embraced, and their teeth chattered they knew not why, as the same imbecile obsession over-mastered them. They had already passed a similar night, but on this occasion the thing was utterly idiotic, as Nana declared when she ceased to be frightened. She suspected something, and this caused her to question the count in a prudent sort of way. It might be that Rose Mignon had sent the famous letter! But that was not the case; it was sheer fright, nothing more, for he was still ignorant whether he was a cuckold or no.","He had a vision of her in her grave after she’d been asleep for a hundred years; he clasped his hands and mumbled a prayer. For some time now his faith had been regaining ground and his religious qualms would descend on him like an apoplectic stroke, leaving him utterly overcome. Now his fingers were cracking as he kept repeating just two words: ‘Oh God! … Oh God! … Oh God!. . .’, a cry of distress at his utter failure to resist his sinful temptation even although he knew he would be eternally damned. When she went over to him, she found him lying under the blanket with a wild look in his eyes, his hands clasped on his chest, and staring upwards as if seeking heavenly aid. She burst into tears again and they embraced, with their teeth chattering, both caught up in the same idiotic obsession which neither of them could explain. A similar thing had happened to them on a previous occasion, but tonight, as Nana remarked when she had recovered from her fears, they were both behaving like complete imbeciles. Nana suspected that Rose might have already sent him the famous letter and made a cautious enquiry. But this wasn’t the problem, it was nothing more than a sudden panic; he was still in the dark over his wife’s affair with Fauchery."

"Le comte Muffat n’avait pas encore ouvert les lèvres. Il songeait invinciblement à sa jeunesse. Sa chambre d’enfant était toute froide. Plus tard, à seize ans, lorsqu’il embrassait sa mère, chaque soir, il emportait jusque dans son sommeil la glace de ce baiser. Un jour, en passant, il avait aperçu, par une porte entrebâillée, une servante qui se débarbouillait ; et c’était l’unique souvenir qui l’eût troublé, de la puberté à son mariage. Puis, il avait trouvé chez sa femme une stricte obéissance aux devoirs conjugaux ; lui-même éprouvait une sorte de répugnance dévote. Il grandissait, il vieillissait, ignorant de la chair37, plié à de rigides pratiques religieuses, ayant réglé sa vie sur des préceptes et des lois. Et, brusquement, on le jetait dans cette loge d’actrice, devant cette fille nue. Lui qui n’avait jamais vu la comtesse Muffat mettre ses jarretières, il assistait aux détails intimes d’une toilette de femme, dans la débandade des pots et des cuvettes, au milieu de cette odeur si forte et si douce. Tout son être se révoltait, la lente possession dont Nana l’envahissait depuis quelque temps l’effrayait, en lui rappelant ses lectures de piété, les possessions diaboliques qui avaient bercé son enfance. Il croyait au diable. Nana, confusément, était le diable, avec ses rires, avec sa gorge et sa croupe, gonflées de vices. Mais il se promettait d’être fort. Il saurait se défendre.","Count Muffat had not yet opened his lips. He thought invincibly of his youth. Her childhood bedroom was very cold. Later, at the age of sixteen, when he kissed his mother every evening, he took the ice of that kiss even into his sleep. One day, passing by, he had seen, through a half-open door, a servant girl washing her face; and that was the only memory that had troubled him, from puberty to his marriage. Then, he had found in his wife a strict obedience to conjugal duties; he himself felt a kind of devout repugnance. He was growing up, he was growing old, ignorant of the flesh,37 bent on rigid religious practices, having regulated his life by precepts and laws. And, suddenly, they threw him into that actress' dressing room, in front of that naked girl. He who had never seen the Countess Muffat put on her garters, he witnessed the intimate details of a woman's toilet, in the confusion of pots and basins, in the midst of this odor so strong and so sweet. His whole being revolted, the slow possession with which Nana had invaded him for some time frightened him, reminding him of his religious readings, the diabolical possessions which had cradled his childhood. He believed in the devil. Nana, confusedly, was the devil, with her laughter, with her throat and her buttocks, swollen with vices. But he promised himself to be strong. He could defend himself.","Count Muffat had scarcely said a word: he was immersed in thoughts of his youth. The room he had when a child had been very cold. Later on, when sixteen years old, he used to kiss his mother every night, and would then feel, even in his sleep, the icy coldness of her embrace. One day, as he passed a half-closed door, he caught a glimpse of a maid-servant washing herself; and that was the only reminiscence that had troubled him from the age of puberty to the day of his marriage. Then he had encountered in his wife a strict observance of conjugal duties; he himself experienced a sort of devout repugnance. He grew up, he grew old, ignorant of the ways of the flesh, bent to rigid religious practices, having regulated his life according to precepts and laws; and suddenly he found himself deposited in this actress’s dressing-room, in company of this almost naked girl. He who had never even seen Countess Muffat put on her garters was now assisting at the most secret details of a woman’s toilet, in the midst of that fascinating and powerful odour, surrounded by all those pots and basins. His whole being revolted; the slow possession that Nana had taken of him for some little time past terrified him, as it recalled to his mind the pious stories he had read in his childhood of persons possessed by devils. He believed in the devil. In his confused state of mind, Nana, with her smiles and her body full of vice, was the devil in person. But he would be strong; he would know how to defend himself.","Count Muffat, indeed, had not yet opened his lips. He was thinking perforce of his own youth. The bedroom of his childish days had been quite cold, and later, when he had reached the age of sixteen and would give his mother a good-night kiss every evening, he used to carry the icy feeling of the embrace into the world of dreams. One day in passing a half-open door he had caught sight of a maidservant washing herself, and that was the solitary recollection which had in any way troubled his peace of mind from the days of puberty till the time of marriage. Afterward he had found his wife strictly obedient to her conjugal duties but had himself felt a species of religious dislike to them. He had grown to man's estate and was now aging, in ignorance of the flesh, in the humble observance of rigid devotional practices and in obedience to a rule of life full of precepts and moral laws. And now suddenly he was dropped down in this actress's dressing room in the presence of this undraped courtesan. He, who had never seen the Countess Muffat putting on her garters, was witnessing, amid that wild disarray of jars and basins and that strong, sweet perfume, the intimate details of a woman's toilet. His whole being was in turmoil; he was terrified by the stealthy, all-pervading influence which for some time past Nana's presence had been exercising over him, and he recalled to mind the pious accounts of diabolic possession which had amused his early years. He was a believer in the devil, and, in a confused kind of way, Nana was he, with her laughter and her bosom and her hips, which seemed swollen with many vices. But he promised himself that he would be strong-- nay, he would know how to defend himself.","Count Muffat had not yet uttered a word. He was assailed by uncontrollable memories of his youth. His nursery had been dreadfully cold. Later on, at the age of 16, every evening when he kissed his mother goodnight, her icy kiss would pursue him even during his sleep. One day he’d caught a passing glimpse through a half-open door of one of the maids having a wash; that was his only disturbing recollection from his puberty till his marriage. Then he’d found himself with a wife conscientiously fulfilling her marital obligations while he himself experienced a sort of pious disgust. He had grown up and now was growing old ignorant of the pleasures of sex, submitting to strict religious observances, letting his life be ruled by laws and precepts. Now suddenly he’d been thrown into this actress’s dressing-room, facing this naked tart. He’d never seen Countess Muffat even putting on her garters, and now he was witnessing the intimate details of a woman’s toilet, amid a clutter of jars and basins, in this air heavy with soft, rich perfumes. His whole being was in revolt, he was terrified to see how Nana had slowly been taking possession of him recently, in a way that reminded him of the pious texts and fears of possession by the Devil fed to him in his childhood. He believed in Satan, and in his bewildered mind Nana, with her laughter, her breasts, the curves of her buttocks, was the Devil incarnate, vicious to the core. But he swore to himself that he’d be steadfast and resist."

"Un laquais, loué à la nuit, introduisait les invités dans le petit salon, une pièce étroite où l’on avait laissé quatre fauteuils seulement pour y entasser le monde. Du grand salon voisin, venait un bruit de vaisselle et d’argenterie remuées, tandis que, sous la porte, une raie de vive clarté luisait. Nana, en entrant, trouva, déjà installée dans un des fauteuils, Clarisse Besnus, que la Faloise avait amenée.","A lackey, hired by the night, ushered the guests into the small drawing-room, a narrow room where only four armchairs had been left to squeeze in the company. From the large adjoining drawing-room came a sound of moving crockery and silverware, while under the door a ray of bright light shone. Nana, on entering, found, already seated in one of the armchairs, Clarisse Besnus, whom La Faloise had brought.","A footman, hired for the night, ushered the guests into the parlour—a narrow room, in which four easy-chairs only had been left, so as to leave more space for the people. From the drawing-room close by could be heard a noise of crockery and plate being moved about; whilst a bright light shone under the door. Nana, on entering, found Clarisse Besnus, whom La Faloise had brought, already seated in one of the chairs.","A footman hired for the evening was ushering the guests into the small drawing room, a narrow slip of a place in which only four armchairs had been left in order the better to pack in the company. From the large drawing room beyond came a sound as of the moving of plates and silver, while a clear and brilliant ray of light shone from under the door. At her entrance Nana found Clarisse Besnus, whom La Faloise had brought, already installed in one of the armchairs.","A footman hired for the night was showing each arrival into the small drawing-room, a tiny room furnished with only four armchairs to enable all the guests to be packed in. From the large drawing-room next door there came a clatter of plates and silver cutlery; a bright streak of light shone under the door. When Nana went in she found Clarisse already ensconced in one of the armchairs; she was escorted by la Faloise."
"Le jour allait paraître. Nana détourna les yeux de la porte, perdant espoir. On s’ennuyait à crever. Rose Mignon avait refusé de chanter La Pantoufle49, pelotonnée sur un capané, où elle causait bas avec Fauchery, en attendant Mignon qui gagnait déjà une cinquantaine de louis à Vandeuvres. Un monsieur gras, décoré et de mine sérieuse, venait bien de réciter Le Sacrifice d’Abraham, en patois d’Alsace ; quand Dieu jure, il dit : « Sacré nom de moi ! » et Isaac répond toujours : « Oui, papa ! » Seulement, personne n’ayant compris, le morceau avait paru stupide. On ne savait que faire pour être gai, pour finir follement la nuit. Un instant, Labordette imagina de dénoncer les femmes à l’oreille de la Faloise, qui allait rôder autour de chacune, regardant si elle n’avait pas son mouchoir dans le cou. Puis, comme des bouteilles de champagne restaient dans le buffet, les jeunes gens s’étaient remis à boire. Ils s’appelaient, s’excitaient ; mais une ivresse morne, d’une bêtise à pleurer, envahissait le salon, invinciblement. Alors, le petit blondin, celui qui portait un des grands noms de France, à bout d’invention, désespéré de ne rien trouver de drôle, eut une idée : il emporta sa bouteille de champagne et acheva de la vider dans le piano. Tous les autres se tordirent.","The day was about to dawn. Nana looked away from the door, losing hope. We were bored to death. Rose Mignon had refused to sing La Pantoufle,49 curled up on a capané, where she was talking quietly with Fauchery, while waiting for Mignon, who was already earning fifty louis at Vandeuvres. A fat gentleman, decorated and serious-looking, had just recited The Sacrifice of Abraham, in the patois of Alsace; when God swears, he says: “Sacred name of me! and Isaac always responds, ""Yes, Dad!"" Only, nobody having understood, the piece had seemed stupid. We didn't know what to do to be gay, to end the night madly. For a moment Labordette thought of denouncing the women in the ear of La Faloise, who went prowling around each one, looking to see if she had her handkerchief around her neck. Then, as bottles of champagne remained in the sideboard, the young people had resumed drinking. They called each other, excited each other; but a mournful intoxication, so stupid as to cry, invaded the drawing-room, invincibly. So, the little blonde, the one who bore one of the great names in France, at the end of his invention, desperate to find nothing funny, had an idea: he took his bottle of champagne and finished emptying it into the piano. Everyone else twisted.","The day was about to break. Nana no longer watched the door, having lost all hope. Every one was bored to death. Rose Mignon had refused to sing the “Slipper,” and was curled up on the sofa, where she was whispering with Fauchery, whilst waiting for Mignon, who had already won about fifty louis from Vandeuvres. A stout, distinguished-looking gentleman, wearing a decoration, had, it is true, just recited “Abraham’s Sacrifice,” in Alsatian patois,aj spiced with a certain amount of profanity; only, as no one understood more than a word or two, the recitation fell very flat. Nobody knew what to be at to infuse some gaiety into the proceedings, to finish the night in a sufficiently wild manner. For an instant Labordette had the idea of secretly denouncing the women to La Faloise, who kept prowling round each to see if she hadn’t his handkerchief stowed away in her bosom. However as some bottles of champagne remained on the side-board, the young men started drinking again. They called to each other, they tried to excite one another; but an invincibly mournful drunkenness, of a stupidity to make one weep, overcame them all. Then the little fair-haired fellow, he who bore one of the greatest names of France, quite at a loss what to do, in despair at not being able to think of something funny, had a sudden idea; he took up a bottle of champagne and emptied the contents into the piano. All the others writhed with laughter.","Day was about to dawn, and Nana turned her eyes away from the door, for she was relinquishing all hope. The company were bored to distraction. Rose Mignon had refused to sing the ""Slipper"" and sat huddled up on a sofa, chatting in a low voice with Fauchery and waiting for Mignon, who had by now won some fifty louis from Vandeuvres. A fat gentleman with a decoration and a serious cast of countenance had certainly given a recitation in Alsatian accents of ""Abraham's Sacrifice,"" a piece in which the Almighty says, ""By My blasted Name"" when He swears, and Isaac always answers with a ""Yes, Papa! "" Nobody, however, understood what it was all about, and the piece had been voted stupid. People were at their wits' end how to make merry and to finish the night with fitting hilarity. For a moment or two Labordette conceived the idea of denouncing different women in a whisper to La Faloise, who still went prowling round each individual lady, looking to see if she were hiding his handkerchief in her bosom. Soon, as there were still some bottles of champagne on the sideboard, the young men again fell to drinking. They shouted to one another; they stirred each other up, but a dreary species of intoxication, which was stupid enough to drive one to despair, began to overcome the company beyond hope of recovery. Then the little fair-haired fellow, the man who bore one of the greatest names in France and had reached his wit's end and was desperate at the thought that he could not hit upon something really funny, conceived a brilliant notion: he snatched up his bottle of champagne and poured its contents into the piano. His allies were convulsed with laughter.","Dawn was breaking. Nana had given up hope and stopped watching the door. Everyone was bored stiff. Rose Mignon had refused to sing ‘The Slipper’ and was lying curled up on a settee having a whispered conversation with Fauchery and waiting for Mignon, who was already busily picking up a thousand francs or so from Vandeuvres. A solemn gentleman, wearing his decoration, had indeed recited a poem about Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac in Alsatian dialect in which every time God swore, he said, ‘Me Almighty!’, and Isaac always replied, ‘Yes, Daddy!’ But as nobody saw the point, the recitation fell completely flat. Nobody could think of anything really lively to finish off the evening in style, crazily. Labordette tried to start something by whispering a woman’s name in la Faloise’s ear, who would then crawl about trying to find out if she’d got his handkerchief round her neck. As there were still a few bottles of champagne on the sideboard, the young men had started drinking again. They were shouting and egging each other on, but the drawing-room was collapsing into hopeless alcoholic depression and stupidity. Then the blond young man bearing the name of one of the great French families, desperate to find something funny to do and unable to think of anything better, took his bottle of champagne and emptied it into the piano. The other young men all found this excruciatingly amusing."
"Ce jour-là, Georges, malgré la défense de Nana, s’était introduit dans l’hôtel. François l’avait bien vu passer, mais les domestiques en arrivaient à rire entre eux des embarras de la bourgeoise17. Il venait de se glisser jusqu’au petit salon, lorsque la voix de son frère l’arrêta ; et, cloué derrière la porte, il entendit toute la scène, les baisers, l’offre de mariage. Une horreur le glaçait, il s’en alla, imbécile, avec la sensation d’un grand vide sous le crâne. Ce fut seulement rue de Richelieu, dans sa chambre, au-dessus de l’appartement de sa mère, que son cœur creva en furieux sanglots. Cette fois, il ne pouvait douter. Une image abominable toujours se levait devant ses yeux, Nana aux bras de Philippe ; et cela lui semblait un inceste18. Quand il se croyait calmé, le souvenir revenait, une nouvelle crise de rage jalouse le jetait sur son lit, mordant les draps, criant des mots infâmes qui l’affolaient davantage. La journée se passa de la sorte. Il parla d’une migraine pour rester enfermé. Mais la nuit fut plus terrible encore, une fièvre de meurtre le secouait, dans de continuels cauchemars. Si son frère avait habité la maison, il serait allé le tuer d’un coup de couteau. Au jour, il voulut raisonner. C’était lui qui devait mourir, il se jetterait par la fenêtre, quand un omnibus passerait. Pourtant, il sortit vers dix heures ; il courut Paris, rôda sur les ponts, éprouva au dernier moment l’invincible besoin de revoir Nana. Peut-être d’un mot le sauverait-elle. Et trois heures sonnaient, comme il entrait dans l’hôtel de l’avenue de Villiers.","That day, Georges, despite Nana's prohibition, had entered the hotel. François had seen him pass, but the servants managed to laugh among themselves at the embarrassment of the bourgeoise. He had just crept into the little drawing-room when his brother's voice stopped him; and, nailed behind the door, he heard the whole scene, the kisses, the offer of marriage. A horror froze him, he went away, imbecile, with the feeling of a great emptiness under his head. It was only in the rue de Richelieu, in his room above his mother's apartment, that his heart burst into furious sobs. This time, he could not doubt. An abominable image always rose before his eyes, Nana in Philippe's arms; and it seemed to him incest. When he thought he had calmed down, the memory returned, a new fit of jealous rage threw him on his bed, biting the sheets, shouting infamous words that maddened him even more. The day passed like this. He spoke of a migraine to stay locked up. But the night was more terrible still, a fever of murder shook him, in continual nightmares. If his brother had lived in the house, he would have gone and killed him with a knife. By day, he wanted to reason. It was he who was to die, he would throw himself out of the window when an omnibus passed. However, he went out about ten o'clock; he ran around Paris, prowled the bridges, felt at the last moment the invincible need to see Nana again. Perhaps with a word she would save him. And three o'clock struck as he entered the hotel in the Avenue de Villiers.","That day George, in spite of having been forbidden by Nana to do so, had sneaked into the house. François had plainly enough seen him come in, but now the servants merely laughed among themselves over their mistress’s embarrassments. He had crept into the parlour, when the sound of his brother’s voice arrested his advance; and, with his ear at the key-hole, he had heard all that had taken place—the kisses, the offer of marriage. A feeling of horror froze him, he went off, idiotic and with a sensation of emptiness in his head. It was only when he reached the Rue Richelieu, in his room over his mother‘s, that his heart found relief in furious sobs. This time, doubt was impossible. An abominable vision kept appearing before his eyes—Nana in Philippe’s arms; and it seemed to him an incest. When he thought himself calmed, memory returned, and in a fresh fit of jealous rage, he threw himself on his bed, biting the sheets and uttering horrible oaths, which increased his passion. The rest of the day passed thus. He complained of a headache, so as to be able to remain in his room. But the night was more terrible still: a murderous fever shook his frame in a continuous nightmare. If his brother had lived in the house, he would have gone and stabbed him with a knife. When day returned, he tried to reason with himself. It was he who ought to die, he would throw himself from the window as an omnibus passed. However, towards ten o’clock he went out; he wandered about Paris, rambled over the bridges, and then at last felt an invincible longing to see Nana. Perhaps with a word she would save him. And three o’clock was striking as he entered the house in the Avenue de Villiers.","That day Georges had slipped into the house despite Nana's orders to the contrary. Francois had certainly seen him pass, but the servants had now got to laugh among themselves at their good lady's embarrassing situations. He had just slipped as far as the little drawing room when his brother's voice stopped him, and, as one powerless to tear himself from the door, he overheard everything that went on within, the kisses, the offer of marriage. A feeling of horror froze him, and he went away in a state bordering on imbecility, feeling as though there were a great void in his brain. It was only in his own room above his mother's flat in the Rue Richelieu that his heart broke in a storm of furious sobs. This time there could be no doubt about the state of things; a horrible picture of Nana in Philippe's arms kept rising before his mind's eye. It struck him in the light of an incest. When he fancied himself calm again the remembrance of it all would return, and in fresh access of raging jealousy he would throw himself on the bed, biting the coverlet, shouting infamous accusations which maddened him the more. Thus the day passed. In order to stay shut up in his room he spoke of having a sick headache. But the night proved more terrible still; a murder fever shook him amid continual nightmares. Had his brother lived in the house, he would have gone and killed him with the stab of a knife. When day returned he tried to reason things out. It was he who ought to die, and he determined to throw himself out of the window when an omnibus was passing. Nevertheless, he went out toward ten o'clock and traversed Paris, wandered up and down on the bridges and at the last moment felt an unconquerable desire to see Nana once more. With one word, perhaps, she would save him. And three o'clock was striking when he entered the house in the Avenue de Villiers.","That day, although Nana had banned him from the house, Georges had slipped in. François had seen him arrive, but by now the servants had reached the stage of treating the scrapes her ladyship kept landing herself in as a joke. Georges had just got as far as the small drawing-room when he heard his brother’s voice; he stood rooted to the spot behind the door and heard the whole scene, the kisses and the marriage proposal. Shocked and horrified, he went away looking foolish, without waiting to hear more; he had a terrible, empty sensation in his head. It wasn’t until he was back in his room over his mother’s flat in the Rue Richelieu that his heart burst and he exploded into wild sobs. This time there could be no doubt, and in his mind’s eye the same atrocious vision kept looming up, the vision of Nana in his brother’s arms. It seemed to him a sort of incest. Each time he thought he’d calmed down, this memory recurred, and in another frenzy of jealousy he would fling himself down on his bed, chewing his sheets and shouting foul abuse, making himself even madder. He spent the whole day acting like this; to avoid leaving his room, he explained that he had a migraine. When night came, it was even worse; he tossed and turned in a feverish succession of nightmares; if his brother had been living in the house he would have gone and stabbed him to death. When day broke, he tried to reason with himself: it was he who had to die, he was going to throw himself out of the window, under a bus. However, round ten o’clock he went out and roamed all over Paris, lurked round the bridges, and at the last minute felt an irresistible urge to go and see Nana. Maybe a word from her might save him. It was striking three o’clock in the afternoon as he went into the house in the Avenue de Villiers."

"La clameur s’étouffa dans l’anxiété qui serrait les poitrines. Maintenant, les paris s’arrêtaient, le coup se jouait sur l’immense piste. Un silence régna d’abord, comme si les haleines étaient suspendues. Des faces se haussaient, blanches, avec des tressaillements. Au départ, Hasard et Cosinus avaient fait le jeu, prenant la tête ; Valerio II suivait de près, les autres venaient en peloton confus. Quand ils passèrent devant les tribunes, dans un ébranlement du sol, avec le brusque vent d’orage de leur course, le peloton s’allongeait déjà sur une quarantaine de longueurs. Frangipane était dernier, Nana se trouvait un peu en arrière de Lusignan et de Spirit.","The clamor died down in the anxiety that tightened the chests. Now the bets stopped, the shot was played on the huge track. A silence reigned at first, as if the breaths were suspended. Faces were raised, white, with tremors.

When they passed in front of the stands, in a shaking of the ground, with the sudden stormy wind of their race, the peloton had already stretched out over forty lengths. Frangipane was last, Nana was a little behind Lusignan and Spirit.","The noise died away in the anxiety which filled every breast.

"Il triomphait. Mais Nana, maladroite, se méfiant toujours, commit la faute de ne pas lui sauter au cou en s’exclamant. Elle trouva la lettre bien, pas davantage. Alors, il fut très vexé. Si sa lettre ne lui plaisait pas, elle pouvait en faire une autre ; et, au lieu de se baiser, comme d’habitude, après avoir remué des phrases d’amour, ils restèrent froids aux deux côtés de la table. Pourtant, elle lui avait versé une tasse de thé.","He was triumphant. But Nana, clumsy, still suspicious, made the mistake of not jumping on his neck and exclaiming. She found the letter fine, no more. So he was very upset.

Still, she had poured him a cup of tea.","He was delighted with himself. But Nana, still dreading a row, was foolish enough not to throw her arms round his neck and utter words of admiration.

She had, however, poured him out a cup of tea.","He glowed with triumph. But Nana was unskillful; she still suspected an outbreak and now was mistaken enough not to fling her arms round his neck in a burst of admiration. She thought the letter a respectable performance, nothing more. Thereupon he was much annoyed. If his letter did not please her she might write another! And so instead of bursting out in loverlike speeches and exchanging kisses, as their wont was, they sat coldly facing one another at the table. Nevertheless, she poured him out a cup of tea.","He was full of himself, but Nana was still on her guard and tactlessly failed to fling her arms round his neck in ecstatic delight.
